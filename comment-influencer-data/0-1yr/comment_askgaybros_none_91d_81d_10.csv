"We have all been there. It's perfectly okay to grieve and to feel sad, and to hurt.  Take some time to do so.  While there's no right or wrong way to grieve, let me give you some advice on what \*not\* to do:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Don't chase after him.  You'll only make yourself look like a fool. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about here.
2. Don't bad-mouth him in public, and that includes social media.  It makes you look petty.  Again, I have firsthand experience, just don't.
3. Rely on your friends.  This is what they are for.  don't be afraid to ask them for what you need, and a good friend will also give you a dose of perspective as well.
4. Don't let your hurt fester into anger and bitterness.  I spent five years mad at men after I got my heart broken the first time, and that's five years worth of romantic opportunities I missed out on, and can't get back.  My anger only hurt me, my ex could have cared less. 
5. When the first crush of hurt is gone, and you've got a bit more distance, try and think about what went right and what went wrong.  What can you learn from this?  How do you want your next relationship to be different?  Relationships, even bad or failed ones, can always teach you something.  Learn and grow.

&amp;#x200B;

Your first love is a formative experience, and you never entirely get over your heart being broken the first time.  It's a big deal, and it changes you.  Let it.  You're going to be a sadder but wiser person when you come out on the other side.  We've all survived it, you will too."
"Sorry if this comes across as insensitive, but everyone in this situation is stupid. You‚Äôre stupid for allowing this to go on as such for 12 years without some kind of intervention. The wife is stupid for not having sex WITH HER HUSBAND, because then there‚Äôs no point in this monogamous relationship. But your friend is a huge idiot for continuing whatever this is, staying with his wife when she‚Äôs not satisfying him, and not acknowledging that he might as well be gay for all intents and purposes.

Mess."
"Can't blame her for writing. I think you should tell your friend about the letter and discuss what to do. If he wants to stay married and respects his wife, sacrifices must be made. But if not...."
Fuck 'em. Hair is sexy as fuck. Self-confidence is sexy too. Own that shit
"I believe you've come to the right place.  Personally I dont think you should say anything specifically.  I'd allow him space to tell you when he is ready.  With that in mind, i would let him know that you love him no matter what he has to say.  It takes a lot of courage to come out of the closet and even more so to a parent.  With that said, I'd be proud to have you as a father with your attitude."
"if i were in your shoes, i'd have a quiet moment w/ mum and directly &amp; unemotionally ask her why she breached your privacy. (keep it short and sweet.) this changes the issue to trust from orientation. by asking ONLY, and not accusing, i'd show how i was surprised and hurt by her snooping (i'd use that word since it has some bite) and rhetorically surmise that she didn't respect you sufficiently to allow your private thoughts to remain your own. if you can get her thinking that YOU'RE the wronged one rather than she, there's a good chance that you'll come out ahead (more respect, proof that you're an adult, and enhance the value you bring to her/the family's life.) as some politician said, never let a bad situation go to waste. &lt;g&gt; good luck and all."
"My Motto: ""If you don't like the way I look while you are fucking me.......THEN YOU SHOULDNT BE FUCKING ME IN THE FIRST PLACE!"""
under 1000? i have 0 üóø
You created this mess. What happens next is anyone‚Äôs guess.
"First off that's hot af, and secondly play it by ear unless you really like to do it."
It sucks. Hugging a pillow late at night trying to imagine it as a loving bf.
That was hot. Tables turning and stuff. I felt similar when my bottom boyfriend fucked me the first time.
"&gt;What the fuck is this world coming to where social media presence is an important part of dating someone?! 

These people would still be morons even if Instagram didn't exist."
Damn you all sound terrible
"Are you making the effort to approach women? Men will hit on anyone, girls expect you to do that."
"Sounds to me like some if us need to learn from you lol. You did everything right in my book.

I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the other two came around again, but don‚Äôt hold your breath. Sometimes people react badly at first.

Also, sorry to hear about your wife, thats something nobody should have to go through :-("
"He might not even be gay. Losing a good friend because he‚Äôs prioritizing his new girlfriend is really sucky, gay or not. 

You can probably read body language, so if you think so, then just pop in some clues that you support LGBT+ people. ‚ÄúOne of my friends at work went to a pride parade last week, I‚Äôve always wanted to go and show support‚Äù."
"Oh dear God
If you have a bread loaf coming out please sit on the toilet like a grown up
That's super gross"
...He can marry him üíú ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Being gang banged at a bathhouse
"I am a gay man, Married another man &amp; now we have a wonderful family with a stubborn two year old. Being gay does not mean you can‚Äôt be a father, have kids, etc. It‚Äôs just a bit harder, but not impossible. Happy you will be living your true self."
Sounds like it's coming right from the mouth of gay guys who only post/follow thirst trap pics and absolutely nothing else
"Note on J-Lube: It is the cheapest lube you could ever buy. Seriously. 20$ will get you enough powder to make like 10 gallons.

Once you use it, it is incredibly hard to go back because it's a strong lube and works with any toy/dick/condom/fist."
I've had people refuse to talk to me because I don't have a Snapchat account. Guys are petty.
"Oh, well I have at least 3.
One of them is my mother and the other two are Russian bots, but they seem nice..."
"&gt; our brothers *and sisters*

I'll be going to the remembrance tonight in Orlando, as I had friends there that night. I can't believe it's been 3 years. They were definitely taken too soon."
"I had a repeat hookup who was a shorter guy, 5'6 or so?  I guess he had a tall fetish - fine by me, he was hot - so he like saying similar things to me ""oh you're so big"", etc  (I'm not muscled or fat) We'd always start with making out standing (me stooping) and I'd pick him up and he'd wrap his legs around my waist while we continued to make out and grind.   I'd carry him to the couch while still making out and we'd finish up there or on his bed"
"personally, i think it's hot. i vote keep it."
"Yes, bitch. Get that random stranger at work dick and do not feel bad about it."
"Personally, I really like being carried, since I'm 100 pounds most tops who wanna do that have an easy time carrying me to bed, and I also love being fucked while being carried."
"I met a guy who is a total bottom and submissive, his arms were the size of me and he was easily 75 more pounds all muscles."
"&gt;I feel like an awful stereotype and a failure in life. 

I'd contend that sticking with the marraige and being unfulfilled is an even worse stereotype and larger failure.  Good job going forward with it and I hope you both wind up in a better place &lt;3"
"I sometimes envy people who have good relationships with their parents, but it's not healthy/helpful to feel this way. We can't choose the circumstances of our birth, and we must seek not to be defined by them. If you feel this way you should seek closer relationships with other people."
I concur. The proper name is *vaguyna*.
"Contrats! Now, where‚Äôs my fucking husband?"
Didn't need this personal attack
"Nah man, people are referring to when you‚Äôre horny enough to be turned on by some kinky or taboo shit."
"You willingly engaged him, knowing he had a commitment. It's all on you. Own what you've done. I'm reading a ton of excuses in your post. He's married. Don't be a shit. Get out or try to take him away. Understand that if you choose the latter, it'll probably ugly. Grow up. Take the consequences if it's worth it, but also  understand what type of man you're dealing with. Gay/sttaight/bi whatever is irrelevant. She's hurt, and she has no blame here."
"And the gay choir shouted, ""YAS!"""
"Like it or not, there may not be a single thing you can do. You betrayed him in a big way, and by the sound of it, he‚Äôs made a life of his own without you. It‚Äôs good that you‚Äôve seen the error of your ways, but for him it may just be too little, too late. The best you can do is extend the olive branch. If he takes it, great. If not, then that‚Äôs just that."
Just... sex
"I think we learn from experience, and when we reach a point we haven't experienced, we can either embrace the discomfort and grow, or crawl backwards.  He chose the latter, and it sucks.

As an introvert who's never dated, I had high hopes from your first post.  I'm sorry things didn't work out.  This is pretty clearly his issue, though."
"I hooked up with a guy who used old rum bottles to hold his j-lube. he had dozens of them.

def was not the best hookup."
Get yourself a new boyfriend
Online or in person? People ask for snapchat because it's a lot harder to catfish with
"People get rejected for how they dress, how big their apartment is, what car they drive... it's not that surprising and it's been happening for decades at the least.

Rejecting someone for lack of instagram followers isn't that much different.  Shallow people are shallow people."
"He doesn‚Äôt sound like much of a prize, let her have him."
I thought a femme top was called a blouse...
Having men cum inside of me unprotected
This is the beat advice y'all. Let's pack it up. Last one out get the lights.
No suggestion but just drop a message. You are a good friend.
If permanent STIs weren't a thing this would probably be a pretty common thing
This is a great answer. All that I would add is that you could passively show support for the queer community in your day to day life. If he is queer then you will be providing him the most nurturing environment that you can for him to talk to you when he is ready. Thanks for being a great dad!
"Thanks, I've calmed down, it just hurts to know I put so much trust into someone just for them to go and leave me for someone else, then act like it isn't a big deal."
"No.  I cry when I read old letters my boyfriend wrote to me.  I keep them in a folder with other forever-documents.  He had a severe brain injury last December.  Now hes disabled.  So when ever I want to remember how much we used to be in love, I'll pull out a letter and read it to myself."
"i dated an older guy that used to call me boy, let me tell you that shit made me moister than an oyster."
sometimes people do surprise you. I guess gave off some vibes of dominance and control?
"Definitely, he exuded dominance but without trying or acting all bossy which is mostly a turnoff for me"
"I am not down with the lingo the kids are using these days.
Waffles do not belong in the shower whilst cleaning ones booty."
"I hope I never befriend any of the gays in this thread who hold the opinion that op did nothing wrong. Jesus, y‚Äôall are prob sneaky mf‚Äôers."
"Let's also remember that radical Islam is just as much of a threat to gay rights as radical Christianity.

Out of the 11 countries that have the death penalty for homosexuality, 10 are predominantly Islamic. The Pulse shooter killed 49 people because his religion told him to hate them. Remember that."
This gay sex thing sounds so taxing and tedious! Coming from a virgin
"Some do, some don't.

Heteronormative is a nice safety net.  One of the perks of being in a gay relationship is the choice to buck those, if both parties are into it.  

And, yeah, masc4masc is a thing and it's normally the femme dudes making noise and getting rejected.  But tbh if a top doesn't suck dick I'm also going to reject his ass."
Talk to your boyfriend!
"He's currently in the mail, shipping time is about 1 month-20 years."
Toy dick condom fist.
"Microsoft has been one of the strongest allies of the LGBTQ community in existence. As far back as the 90s, when the phobia of the AIDS epidemic were still rampant, Matthew Shepard was beaten to death, and Clinton was signing ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell,‚Äù (which actually was progress at the time,) Microsoft was providing life partner benefits to LGBTQ employees. Complete benefits. They had immigration lawyers to help facilitate bringing partners from foreign companies into the country, and they had a policy if supporting trans employees as whichever gender they presented as. 

Many capitalist organizations have been powerful allies of the LGBT community. Do not alienate allies from celebrating Pride with you; there used to be a time where many companies would fire you and landlords evict you. Anyone who wishes to celebrate with us should be able to, and we all will be closer and progress together when we do."
"""Boy pussy"" never say that again."
I would give you all the dad hugs you could want. I can not even begin to imagine the anguish you are feeling.
I don‚Äôt read the comments-especially on Instagram. They‚Äôre usually dumpster fires that get progressively worse as people fight back. I took one quick glance at the Xbox comments when they posted that pride pic and just wanted to throw up. Rule of thumb: don‚Äôt read the comments.
Upvoted for pointed and honest response AND a fun rhyme.
One of my buddies (who isn‚Äôt out) is a fire fighter and he was laughing about the other guys being upset that they might have to sleep in the same space with a couple obviously gay paramedics. He was toying with the idea of saying but you‚Äôve been sleeping and showering with me for years and it hasn‚Äôt been a problem.
Dude she already knows and is cool with it. You aren‚Äôt nearly as slick as you think you are. Rip the band aid off so you can start having an adult relationship with your parents.
"I dont really have advice, but I just wanted to comment about the English thing. Almost everytime someone brings up that english isnt their first language and apologizes for any mistakes, they almost always write it Perfectly. Your English is fine. Be confident in it, there is no need to address that it's not your main language. People would never know otherwise."
Or at least date and have sex with sleepovers more than 3x/month!
"No harm at all, have at it."
Also the wife for not talking to the husband before going to OP
I love that those cunts are so triggered by pride and there's nothing they can do about it.
the gym i go to is full of huge muscle men that even look homophobic and 90% of them are bottoms.
Love a hairy man! More body hair you have the more it turns me on
"You manufactured a lot of pain, humiliation, shame, loneliness, insecurity, and self loathing and saddled your kid with that FOR YEARS. You didn't just disappear, you willfully hurt him, which is far worse.  Don't assume that what you did can be undone.  And don't for a minute assume you have any right to have a relationship with him; you poisoned that connection.

You can keep gently trying, periodically, but don't be a pest. He knows you want to connect with him. If he continues to ignore you, then you only add to his stress and unhappiness by opening up an old wound.

I know I'm being hard on you here, but it's important you know the gravity of your actions. You're lucky he's alive. Suicide rate of the LGBT community is approximately 5X or more than that of the general population... Because of parents like you, amongst other things. Again, you're lucky he's alive. Be thankful for that."
"he will absolutely rebel if you demand he end their situation... they've talked on the phone and on video, which is as sure as you can be with any online relationship.

""what exactly do they talk about"" i'm sure you're concerned, but this is not your place to pry - only involve yourself in this if its proven the other boy is not 14.

your son wants to meet said other boy in a completely public location - a BOOK FAIR/gaming convention, which sounds like the safest option even available for them... you can stay nearby (not directly next to them, but stay at the actual convention) while the two meet one another. if they want to hang-out after that, let them once you've met the boy.

seriously, it sounds like your son is being as safe as possible with this."
"I think women and gays have different perception of what ""hot"" is."
"""none of us know the full story"".  Forgive me but I absolutely will not take OP's version of her behavior as it necessarily came from the dude that cheating on her. Seriously?"
He's clearly scared that youre not actually going to be into dudes
Do you just waffle stomp the enema juice down the drain or what?
"As the parent of a lesbian child (I follow this reddit because you know, the more you know) it makes me incredibly sad that you all have faced such problems with your parents. Please accept a virtual mom hug from me! You all are exactly who you should be. Be proud of who you are. There are those of us that are proud of you."
"No, I like sleeping alone.  It's during the day that I get upset with no one to share eating, traveling, and activities with.  No, I cry during the day."
"Just become a single entity, the [name]"
Owner of Pure for Men here. Our team was deeply moved by your story and would like to show some Love by covering travel and room for you and your friend on the upcoming Miami trip. Please DM me and I'll connect you with our team to figure out how best to make this happen. We're so proud of you and excited for the road ahead. Your friend is a true one and we'd love to show him our admiration. Thanks!
"Yeah over all this is true. Guys have to be 10/10 attractive to be hit on regularly by women. I had a good friend that was hit on a lot by women and men. 

Most gay guys will find op cute. Cause we are guys. Men are horny MOFOs lol."
F
"Yup, if he's cheating with you, then don't be surprised when he cheats on you."
"It's wonderful. Everything in life worth doing has it's work involved. 
Straight sex is also messy and takes lots of work to make it good.
Life is generally taxing and tedious.
Good luck!"
"Someone called me a ""human throwback"" for only being on FB lol. And that's when I stopped dating 19yos..."
Damn right. If I had to choose between people I would look for hair as a factor.
"Oh man, you are picking the wrong type of tops, not all are like that.
I'm ver+too and never asked my partner to shave. And I do love smooth skin. The most I did was shaving them myself, in a fun way but even so not everytime. Never diminish none of them for their body.
That makes me special? No! That's is normal!
Keep looking."
"It's mysterious to me why straight society is so HARSHLY triggered by men goofing around playing dressup, yet women with short haircuts in pants or whatever tend to get a free pass. Yeah it wasn't always like that, but what is consistent is that the man playing with gender is always punished so much harsher than the female.

&amp;#x200B;

What is so threatening about a man who isn't playing his gender role?? Do they think we wear four foot tall wigs and borderline clown makeup to go out and try to hit on straight men? And even then, even if that were remotely the point of doing it, how hard is it to just be like, gross, fuck off if and when it happens?"
*Pretends to be shocked*
A threesome where I suck and are fucked in the ass at the same time and the 2 cumming inside me without condom
"You threw him out of your life. Right? I hate to say this but... he built a new life WITHOUT you in it. Now he‚Äôs engaged and living his best new life, and you come groveling back? It‚Äôs great that you realize you were wrong - I commend you. But I think you may have realized things a bit too late. The time to realize your mistake was maybe an hour after you made it. Or the next day. Not YEARS later. 

My condolences for your loss. He sounds like an awesome guy."
I agree. All technology has done is given idiots more and different ways to be idiots than before. The world is not better or worse for it. Just different.
"Gays are men that women can feel safe around.  It sucks in many ways to be a woman, knowing that any male can (and may want to) assault, harass or rape you.  

Gays are also men that may be interested in women for friendship rather than just being interested in their genitals.

Meanwhile, straight men rarely have female friends they aren't interested in fucking.  Maybe it's just a terrible stereotype but hanging with straight guys for most of my life, so many of them are always thinking about women as objects.  Also, having a masculine butch lesbian friend would be a threat to the masculinity of many straight males. 

Lastly, many lesbians feel uncomfortable around straight males.  I've at least heard complaints about lesbians being either sexualized or insulted.

I could be wrong on all of these accounts but they're my best guesses."
It goes bad. You need to make new stuff every week or two and keep it sealed in sanitary containers. This sounds like a bad hookup.
"omg I just commented from the first post wishing you good luck but he ghosted you?! This made me sad. *You had me on the first half, not gonna lie.*  
Well, all I can say is that, I hope he'll text you back."
"Thanks a lot. I'm terrible at this dr Phil type of shit but I tried and I'm still gonna keep on doing it lmao

And they will be fine but Miami is just us 2 and 2 open rooms, I told him to invite some of his friends over and he seems weary to do so because he just came out to myself. Understandable, but I just want him to be comfortable. We've done EVERYTHING the way 75% of us wanted to, so its def his turn. 

And thanks for the condolences, no one should have to go through that I agree. Appreciate that a lot my man"
"Straight pride should be encouraged, because all that ever happens is a bunch of bigots show themselves up for what they really are."
"In every single place on Earth where Islam is the predominant religion, gay people suffer. There are some 50 Muslim majority countries, and there isn't a single one of them where gay people can live a happy life outside of the closet. Islam is without a doubt the greatest threat to our existence worldwide. Under every mainstream school of Islamic jurisprudence, the punishment for us is death."
"Okay, this is clearly not going to be popular with the OP and he may not be popular with anyone.   This is wrong.  This isn't wrong about the age. I couldn't care less.  This is wrong because this guy is acting in a professional medical position.  No, you don't get to date your patients EVER."
Feel your feelings and be sad for a while. Eat some ice cream. Watch corny movies. Then go suck a dick or five.
"&gt;She's hurt, and she has no blame here.

I take issue with this sentence because she's treated her husband quite badly. None of us know the full story but beating her husband up over his porn collection is outright abusive and totally unacceptable. Making him feel guilty for masturbating is also obviously a bad move.

While OP shouldn't have started a sexual relationship with his friend, and his friend shouldn't have been complicit in it, the friend must have felt quite sexually repressed. There's blame on both sides."
"Pretty similar to how it happened for me. I was 17. My sister found my journal-thing and brought to mother's attention. 

It was a process. First I had to help my mother understand. She was not receptive at first. She asked me to give dating women a shot. Haha. Actually 3 shots. And if instill thought I was gay after 3 girls then to proceed with my gay life. Hahaha! I explained to her that I didnt feel that would be fair to the girls.

Alas, I wasnt dating or anything so it became a silent issue. It never came back up. Until I was in college (19 yo) and someone asked me out. I tried to ask her for permission to date a boy. She said no. Big surprise. Haha.  

I lied and found ways to get out and date him anyway. I felt stifled. I felt like I had to do it. I wanted to just be me. When it came to light she was very hurt. She kicked me out and we didn't talk for over a year. It was a tough year. 

It wasn't just hard on me. It was hard on the whole family.  (Especially grandma üò≠) I found allies. Members of my family came forward and showed support. They all had a similar thing to say: they had an idea, and now that they know they just wanted me to know that it doesnt change what I mean to them. 

Anyway, as time passed Mom came around. When she finally came around she said the same thing as everyone else. She'd always known. She just never wanted that life for me. She was hurt that I lied to her. To be fair i tried to be honest and she shut it down. She was sad that she'd never see my children, her grand children. She even told me that of all of her kids she knew I was going to be the best father. And she felt she lost that in that moment. Finally, she grew up in a different time. When she was in her 20's, before kids, she did hair. As such she was no stranger to gay culture. She watched her gay friends get targeted and become the victims of discrimination and hate. HIV was a new scary thing and she watched friends whither away. She said it was a future she didn't want for me.  

As a mother she only wants you to have a beautiful pain free life. But she cant protect you forever. And she needs to recognize this. She will come around, it just may take time. 

In the grand scheme of things, that year was rough. . . But it was only *one* year. I will say there were a lot of times during that year that I could have used her guidance. So be sure you have a support system you can reach out to if your facing the same issue. Now my mother is my biggest supporter. She's gone back to school to earn a master's in transgender studies. (I'm not transgender but after years of research this became her passion)

*tldr: it may take time. You will need space. But she will come around. She needs to figure out what it means for her too right now.*

Hope this helps."
It seems your problem may lie deeper than just sexually then. As a couple you should at least be able to meet halfway
Keep it.
"Really. Why the fuck does she even think of peeking into someone‚Äôs writing? That is the issue, not the orientation, and it would definitely trigger me."
Don‚Äôt do chemistry unless you plan on going to grad school
"There are more straight guys than gay guys, so statistically speaking, someone you find attractive is more likely to be straight."
I have a sense he‚Äôs a fuckboy currently getting his shit together.
Are you going to return the brojob?
Can always get a boyfriend and call him daddy
What gym is that please?
Could you elaborate on the hilarious body? Haha
I think most gay people know this already. It's straight people who usually assume fem guys are all bottoms and masc guys are all tops.
i still jerk off to mormon gay porn so everyone in utah can suck my dick
"I have friends that have *five* kids. ü§£ü§£

I was like damn, I don‚Äôt even know too many heteoro couples who do that today lol."
"Congratulations!!!

I remember what a relief it was when my straight marriage ended!"
"Be careful with enemas! You can wash away a ton of gut bacteria if you overuse it, and cause more problems down the road. In my experience, if you keep track of your diet, an enema isn't necessary.

Also, if your guy freaks out from a little shit on his dick, he has no business shoving it up your hole."
"I had a large group of straight friends that I had to come out to (fortunately they stood by me). But one of the big things that I was intent on proving to them at the time is that I was the SAME person/friend I had always been. I still like watching football, I still like doing all the same shit - I also love men so what. Just because he came out to you doesn't mean he wants to spend every waking minute at gay bars in Miami. I would encourage you to get him to at least one (they are the best) but he is likely still experiencing some internalized homophobia and might be more uncomfortable than you are at first. You're a good friend - continue to be supportive and showing love to him. It doesn't all happen overnight but he took the biggest and hardest step by telling you. A year from now you will most likely see a much happier and authentic friend who is living their truth üíú."
Hijacking this top comment to say LOL at your edit. I KNEW you would get loads of downvotes for using the word boypussy. That word gets a lot of uptight gays' nastypigs in a twist
The Xbox ones are the worrrrrrst which is hilarious since they don't do shit for LGBT people anyway.
"LOL, I commented on your face picture on r/amiugly hours before you posted on here.  For the record I wasn't hitting on you. :)  You don't have rainbows coming out of your unicorn horn.   We do live in a world where men usually make the first move.  Maybe you are not coming on to enough girls or in the right way to catch a woman.  Gay men today have a lot more confidence and figure it is worth a try.  Unless you are a douche bag, I have no doubt that you will find a really attractive woman."
"I'd never do this because it's incredibly dangerous, but...  


Sitting on a bare mattress in a bedroom while a line of guys waits outside the room, and one by one they enter to get their cock sucked to completion. I wouldn't swallow, but they'd cum in my mouth and I'd push it out down my chin so I'd be pretty covered by the time I'd served everyone."
"Dropped him a couple, haven't heard back yet. I told him I'll be ready when he wants to talk. And I can take days off too. He'll come around after a few beers or so hopefully lol"
That‚Äôs not a friend then.
And this is why things like Pride month are necessary.
It would be my every Tuesday
"Let‚Äôs take heart that they were -even in Utah - kicked off the team and the football coach even said he was sickened.  That‚Äôs what hope comes disguised as.

Maybe because they are HS students they will learn something from it."
"&gt; Now I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever see him again, or have the chance to tell him how I feel. 

You found his facebook, just write him a note about how it was great meeting and would you like to get a hot chocolate sometime"
"Its hard for me to say that we're together.  The only thing he knows about me is my name.  He doesn't remember meeting me, any of our dates or spending any time with me before the injury.

He had something called herpes simplex viral encephalitis.  Its what happens when the brain has a herpes outbreak on it.  Despite getting treatment within 72 hours of showing symptoms, and spending a month in the hospital, the brain damage was severe.  He does not remember the last 7 years of his life - we only dated for 4 years.  On good days, he thinks I'm someone famous from TV.  On most days, the only thing about me that he knows is my name.  Retrograde amnesia, while serious, isn't the most devastating thing for him.  The reason that he is now disabled is that he can no longer create new memories.  Anterograde amnesia.

He can't remember getting half of that tattoos that he sees on his body.  His finger, which he cut a nerve in and can no longer bend, also adds to his confusion.  Because of those issues, and his awareness that he should have a lot more memories about whats going on around him, he has rationalized that he is currently in a dream.  Its delusional, but it keeps him calm.  The first couple of months he spent outside of the hospital, he was extremely emotional.  Lots of anxiety, lots of crying, lots of time spend quietly thinking and then crying.  He was aware that something had happened, something in his brain wasn't working correctly.  Cognitively, he's the guy I fell in love with.  If it wasn't for the glaring issue with his memory, he's exactly the Tyler I remember.

I am grieving the loss of his memory.  I believe I am experiencing feelings similar to those of people who have family members with Alzheimer's.  He's not dead.  But he is so profoundly changed that he needs to be cared for, for the rest of his life.  He has turned on the stove to cook, but walked away.  Later, the smoke alarm was going off.  Now he can't be left alone.  The idea that he can live independently is more of a fantasy.  He will have to spend the rest of his life being monitored so that he does not hurt himself.  A good life for him will be one where his safety takes precedent over his happiness.  Which is very hard to accept.  I can't take care of him, its too dangerous to leave him alone."

"Sounds like she wants a closer relationship with you, you‚Äôre heading off to college and she knows you‚Äôre going to meet new people, explore and experiment and she wants a connection with her son. 

You don‚Äôt have to come out to her because she wants you to but why not use this opportunity to do it anyway, you won‚Äôt be home much longer and you‚Äôre going to come out eventually, you‚Äôre mom seems interested and she‚Äôs actively making effort to assure you of her love and support. 

This could lay the foundation for a closer more open relationship between you and your parents, or at least you and your mother."
"Just the other day, here in DC, a gay couple was assaulted in nightlife-y area by some Maryland teenagers.  They started a gofundme page since the one didn't have health insurance.  The funding goal was met pretty quickly mostly due to gay venues and gays posting and sharing it on social media.  I think I trust the gay community (at least in DC).

"&gt;show support for the queer community 

I was just going to say this. Coming out wasn't stressful to me because I was worried people would stop *loving* me. I was worried people wouldn't *accept* me. It doesn't seem like there's much of a distinction, but people stamp ""love"" on a lot of relationships that you don't really experience as loving.

So OP's son knowing that he will be loved *and* supported is hugely important. And you want your loved ones to support LGBTQ people's rights, not just give you a pass because they know you/love you while harboring antipathy towards anyone like you. So I think tactfully expressing support for LGBTQ people in general would be massively helpful to his son."
"Lol this story is so ridiculous. The husband for staying in this sexless marriage. The wife for marrying when she doesn't want make love to her husband. The friend for knowingly home

What irony? Enjoy being laughed at for your straight parade lol
Now that you know there are tables to turn.
The first time I went to a bathhouse I thought it was just a spa and took my (also gay) friend there for his birthday. We were confused when we had to get naked to go into the spa but the rest was a pleasant surprise and a pretty good birthday present to my friend.

sounds logical to me. being gay relies on the attraction between two men and masculine qualities come with that attraction.
"   I dont have any personal experience in the matter but my advice? Do what you have to too survive. Dont tell him your gay, just deny. 
   Dont involve another girl (hopefully). Your SO should be able to understand the situation. Tell what he needs to hear and no more no less. 
   We the internet cannot make a decision gor you owing that we have not met your dad and mom.
   Alot of people will tell you to cut him off. But the question is at what cost? Your future? Once college is done and you can support yourself, tell him the truth. Hopefully he will understand."
I'm more shocked that you watch TV during sex
That's so hot.

Seriously. From a ""broken home"" son, fuck
Anyone who thinks that this is a funny joke. 

That woman had very right to beat you senseless in my book."
"I guess I have a different view.

I, too, had a completely different set of expectations with my husband when we first got together and it took several years to even get into the same ballpark.  The thing is, while sex is important, it's not the only aspect of a relationship.  At the end of the day, we only spend a small percentage of our time with our partners having sex.  Is it worth it to throw away a great relationship just because the sex isn't perfect?  I'd argue no.  It's just as easy for you to change to meet his needs as it is for him to meet yours.

The key to a successful relationship is definitely compromise; that's when neither party gets everything they want.  My suggestion is to focus on what you have rather than what you don't have.  Beyond that, it may be worth getting couples counseling--especially if he's just not into sex.  Get to the root of both of your issues, commit to addressing them and work on them together."

When the sadness goes away (which it will) you‚Äôll probably appreciate him for being your first relationship, but also start to realize what you like and don‚Äôt like in a romantic relationship."
I used to work near the site of the Manchester Arena bombing. A few days after the bombing we received a lovely card from families and survivors of the Pulse attack. They are forever in my heart. Much love from the UK.

"One of my most memorable experiences is a Grindr hookup starting with fucking me on the bed, and then he lifted me up and fucked me up against the wall, and then he carried me into the kitchen and fucked me on the counter, and then he fucked me on the living room table and then fucked me on the ground.  He just carried me around everywhere.  It was 50% funny, 50% hot.  He's a super young guy so I guess he just wanted to try it and show off his strength?

If I were you I would play it by ear.  What you've described is very simple and not that extreme.  If they don't like it, they'll tell you."

But hey it's actually awesome, you know why? Pride MONTH. Not just Pride. Pride used to just be this thing happening randomly at different dates during the spring/summer in different cities, but now that corporations have realized that Pride has the potential to be this new summer holiday celebration type thing during a long stretch of the year where there isn't really anything big like Halloween or Christmas, they've turned into something that's gaining a lot of steam and getting a lot bigger.

if you've changed and learned that's great! join an organization and be there for disowned gay kids who were kicked out of their house by their horrible parents. you fucked up with your child, and have to live with that, but can make up for it by helping others in the same position as your son was. atone for your sins, if you will."
Someone having more than a thousand Instagram followers is kind of a red flag to me. Someone not using social media is incredibly attractive.
"Pat yourself on the back - you must be doing something right if your son trusts you enough to talk to you openly. 

I totally understand your concerns for his safety but he might not know anyone who‚Äôs gay locally. Being the only gay kid can be a very alienating and lonely experience so I also understand why he‚Äôs looking for peers online. 

Meeting someone of the same age at a public event under your supervision seems like pretty harmless to be honest. It sounds like it might turn into more like a friendship rather than a relationship."

"If you were identified with your name and school inside the Reddit post, you can Google 

    &lt;name&gt; &lt;school&gt; site:reddit.com 

and see if Google has found the page. You might need to put quotes around either or both your name and the school's name to reduce the number of matches.

If the Grindr pic was bundled up in a post with the video you could try to reverse image search your Grindr pic on Google. 

Last option that occurs to me is to post the Grindr pic on /r/GayPornHunters and hope one of them has the post with the video saved.

All that said, if the post is deleted already there's not really much Reddit is gonna be able to do, unless maybe you know the username who posted it. If the video was posted on another site like Pornhub you can probably contact them to take it down, but you'll have to find the video first, which probably won't be trivial.

"You need to connect with the two other friends and explain to them that they have betrayed their friendship, that they are cowards. Tell them that the friendship they had is over but if they apologize a new one can be built. Explain that to do what they have done makes them selfish and blind. Explain that the judgement you mete out upon others will be yours to face one day and that the betrayal they think is justified because him coming out made the feel weird is childish. Explain that this is the one and only time you will ask for their apology, and that if they do not you will never contact them again.

"During my senior year of college, I was 22 and I was seeing a guy that was 47. I have daddy issues at times but what I ended up gaining was more of a super-chill friend that liked to drink and fuck as much as I do. He had a solid shoulder on his head and we actually really enjoyed our company together. I stayed at his place almost every day during my that semester of college. Never made things official since I knew I wasn't willing to stay in my college town after finishing and he wouldn't leave because of his elderly parents. Him and I remain good friends to this day.

He probably was the best sexual partner I ever had. Older men just do it better, and are way more open than the other younger college guys I saw before. I'll also hold a special spot for the man that taught me how to dance."

Asking someone if they're gay is very personal, and you might not get the answer or reaction you're looking for. He might just lie if he's not ready to tell you and it may cause him to feel self conscious about it, and try to make sure no other family members assume the same thing."
