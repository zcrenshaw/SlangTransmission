Make other any guy I’m attracted to attracted to me. 
"To play devil's advocate, let's say you gained weight. Perhaps he's not very good with words and this is his way of saying that you should go to the gym and work on yourself, because you're letting yourself go, whatever.

Or maybe it's personality? This is tougher. People change every day. If he thinks it's personality related, this will require talking and figuring out how you both can work better with each other.

Just talk to him and see what his definition of ""unattractive"" means to him. If he's saying it to be constructive and is just using bad word choice, then maybe you don't have to worry about it. Maybe he's just saying that because he still loves you and everything, he just wants to help you be your best?

I honestly don't know, I'm not your BF. Ask him and see what he says."
"Go on Grindr. I'm sure someone there will give you free shit, if that's what you're into."
"A friendship, dating, a relationship, not just random one time hookups that everyone on apps offers. "
Then you are probably the clientele OP (and others) would like to avoid. 
mygay.net
Google knows better than to test their AI on Grindr. Half the guys on there could fail the Turing test. 
My family always comes before a man.
"There used to be IRC chat rooms for gaybros, but I'm pretty sure they're no longer active."
Nah. I’m a swimmer so I was sorta forced to get used to it. 
"No way.  My family doesn’t live my life, I do.  If they don’t like it or aren’t accepting, that’s on them.  "
"Umm, we had sex. A week ago. It was great and there was a lot of intimacy.

But I’m not after a one night stand that goes nowhere anymore. I’m fucking sick of it"
"Setting up emails accounts or any account. Can’t remember why, but I was looking for something in my name and it was easy to find. Only me. No 20,000 John Smith to look thru. "
"Just say thanks, but ur not interested. Better than playing with them"
"If you’re black, then I assume you just wanted to vent, otherwise you’re probably just trolling."
shut up
"I’m sorry I insulted the pizzas at Pastels. Happy?

"Okay non-stereotypical gay, meaning how gay men are perceived by most people in 21st culturally western culture. "
"To me, the hand shake wasn’t a huge indicator, but if he is on Grindr during the date then it’s a no for sure. "
Jeez Mike you took an ugly pill today 
"Just remember the more homophobic he is, the more likely he's gay"
I would honestly just lay low until you’re outa there. Unless you think you can convince them to accept it. 
Sounds like you need to just hang out someplace private and nature will take its course!  Maybe just start talking about TV shows or whatever and invite him over to watch something?
"Well, my family lives below the poverty line, so I wear my dad's slacks and a leather jacket every day. I have a gym membership, but... I don't know how to exercise. Any tips on that regard?

"I’m looking at Van Patten’s card and then at mine and cannot believe that Price actually likes Van Patten’s better.

Dizzy, I sip my drink then take a deep breath.

"Well, focus on your school and get those grades up. "
"Your gut is usually right in instances like this. Honestly, if I saw someone casually on Grindr in a date I wouldn't instantly write them off, but they would receive an enormous number of negative points in my mind - enough that I'd let them pursue me after the date to prove they are genuinely bothered about me. If they didn't then I wouldn't make an effort to get re-involved."
I will do!
"Went off all the meds a year ago.  Went from 297 to 218.  I'm getting there!!

"Shady edit?  You mean the one I put at the top of the comment with “edit:” in front of it?

  And trust me, after I stop getting replies I will not be coming back here.  Everyone here is chocking on their own intolerance and honestly behaving/talking like women.  I doubt there are any “Bros” here."
"It doesn't seem as bad as it was several years ago when grindr came out, but the guys on those apps were pretty blatant about it at the time. If op is who he says he is (which I doubt) then he would still have a difficult time not finding someone shallow."
"I've used one before, but they're not allowed on the slides at this water park.


"
Then you’re not gay you’re bisexual 
"You may want ask him to lube a lot of lube and frequently whenever you feel like your asshole is beginning to dry out. Ask him to eat your ass real good and finger you. Start with one go up to 3 fingers . When you feel ready, ask him to be gentle and slowly sliding that hot cock into your ass. Just keep sliding in and out until you feel like you can take the whole thing or most of it and then tell him to go hard on you like you are his bitch."
"She probably also thinks you shouldn't ever hold hands, kiss, hug, high five, look at, be around, or breathe in the direction of another guy too. What if a gay child sees you? He'll be traumatized!!!"
Go fuck your prototype. I'm an upgrade of your stereotype.
Not that I’m aware of but I don’t get out often.
OP is a troll and a moron.  Don't waste your time.
"homo spotted.

yay!"
Never speak to them. 
You betta tell em
"Exactly! You have viable evidence. If he does get mad then he is not mature enough to understand how he is going to deal with his feelings and sexuality. And you don’t want to be around that, trust me, I’ve been there. He is your boss so you can just stop hanging out with him outside of work and act very professional around him at work to send him a clear message."
I want people to feel free to live their lives however they want without me judging them for it.
"It sucks but I understand it as someone who is partially out. I’m out to people I trust but a lot of my family is pretty traditional and I’m not sure how they’d react. It’s great that the general population is more accepting, but that doesn’t really matter when your close family / dependents don’t reflect the general public. "
Idk this is overall very confusing for me as a gay man. I’ve never really implied we should date or anything but I think we can all agree that leading me on is cruel to both me and his gf.
I need to go back to therapy cause I definitely am not over what they did and what they are continuing to do to me 
Because I'm not into women and fem guys are basically women with dicks and no tits
"Actually that's where it is going. I didn't put it in the update, but yeah. I'm probably going to contact a divorce attorney on Monday. I haven't figured out how to tell my son yet. But that's a tomorrow problem. I just don't want to think tonight."
Yeh don’t see why not 
"[doublelist.com](https://doublelist.com) is the new craigslist personals.  

There are a bunch of sites if you google.  

They're all equally pretty mediocre as most guys will use grindr and the like."
"It means on Grindr you use terms like “bro”, “man” or “masc4masc” but in person you sound gay as fuck and have several selfies on Instagram with huge focus on your butt."
"Some of these sound like low-effort trolling, and some sound like possibly okay questions. Maybe try again one at a time. "
"1) People are into different things, they have different motivations. Some people (i.e. twinks here) may like to be dominated. Conversely the bears like to dominate. It can also occur the other way round. Its just what people are into, and we shouldn't really judge them for it. 

2) Porn is generally scripted, much time and effort has gone into maximizing viewership and thus returns. Market research at some stage would have shown this scenario maintains the viewership and maximizes profit via advertisements. It's also a slower way to work into the fun. 

3) As above, scripted. The bottom has probably spent an hour trying to get 5 mins of perfect shots. I bet if this was IRL you may be not totally into it either. Some guys also just don't get hard when bottoming. 

4)  **Warning Incoming Generalisation**: Quite a lot of gay men, especially those that are young are very superficial. Gay culture promotes strong sexual images of perfect bodies, ripped abs, youth, and performance. IRL this motivates people to prefer what they see in media. Have you ever heard that 30 is gay death. This is what I mean, it's terrible and shouldn't be a thing. By extension an older guy getting with a younger guy is an (terrible) example he still has it and thus the high five. 

5) I think this is totally dependent on where the people are, who is around, and what they are doing. No doubt it happens, as for the stats, can't say. 

6) Yes clean is good. Some people though do have fetishes that prefer a dirty session. 

7) The ass has to be clean. I think gay guys are probably more open to talk about it, and probably participate in it. Probably a misconception though to consider hetro sex to be totally vanilla 

8) Bottom, Top, Vers, Vers Bottom, Vers Top, etc... all exist. Everyone has their preferences. "
"Yeah when I got off the machine he didnt use it. 

Next time I see him maybe I'll try to talk or do a nod somthing lol."
I don’t want something that can track my location. 
I’m also gay in the bay wanna be boyfriends? East bay only tho
"My opinion is 
Don’t lose any of them..
Make them separate 
You spend most of your life with your husband, make the best of it, enjoy, be happy and make him happy.
Parents always loves you no matter what, they created this image in there heads when you were born, of you when you grow up, good guy with a wife, but it didn’t happen, just like your image of your parents accepting you didn’t happen. 
So I’ll say apologize to your parents that you couldn’t be what they wanted you to be and you will always love them and you will always be there for them whenever they need you.
And do the same to your husband apologize that your parents couldn’t be what he expected but you still love him and you will make him the happiest person ever.

Fight for both of them 
They are all family &lt;3
"
"that was really shitty of someone to do. I hope they didn't make you feel even worse about it.

sorry this has happened to you.

You have gotten some great advice here, so I won't repeat everything you've already read. good luck man!

"Therapy, changed my fucking life."
"During his second interview he added in that one of the assailants stated ""This is MAGA country!"" to him while they were assaulting him. 

That's when this story lost me. I understand that yelling MAGA or other atrocious things during an assault like this does in fact occur...all the time....i find it hard to believe that THAT would have been the phrase of choice. 

Then the image of him walking into the lobby with the rope still around his neck. I understand shock, however the flight-or-flight response would most likely have made him pull that off and just throw it away as he ran. 

I'm with you on this, I don't think he acted alone, and the whole thing seems fishy.

"You aren't really in the closet, he knows you had a bf.  Just don't bring it up and obviously leave when you can"
"I know it must suck.  Not much you can do for now.  Keep safe.  Stay in school.  Think about what you will do when you get away to college or move away when you turn 18.  Your life can be awesome, once you leave the stasis you're stuck in.  Read up and plan for your awesome future.  it will come."
"I've had people ask for similar, I couldn't stomach it. Don't do something that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you want to do it, just facefuck the crap out of him."
"If it was me I'd probably laugh as I'd find it so quaint that he couldn't suppress his prejudice.  But then again I don't hold my father in high esteem and I'd make him leave.  


However, I understand your situation might be quite different.  I'd probably feel a bit different if I was your SO.    


I'd say time is a great healer but it has been years already.  So you might just have to accept this is how he'll be.  He was raised a certain way and views that as a foundational truth.  It can take great courage and motivation to overcome such feelings.  Just try to work around him and have family events without him.."
"Unfortunately there are too many flammers here who think they are virtuous, and get offended when they are into masculine guys but masculine guys are not into them, so they contradict themselves by stating that there is no such thing as masculinity, but still targeting masculine men. They have a supreme case of cognitive dissonance.     "
Let people do their jobs without getting hit on
"So I'm conflicted by this post as a black gay man along with the comments; as a black person, 10/10 we would get pissed if someone called one of us the n-word. That said, of course I've been called a faggot by other black people growing up, so while homophobia in the black community is prevalent, I want to stress (while not negating everyone's experience) that it doesn't apply to all of us obviously. "
"Every comparison you make to marriage is from the point of view that you wouldn't be ""a single gay guy"". You know deep down that if you did not have her in your life, you would not be straight. 

I don't dispute that your girlfriend is probably fun, and that you recognize that she is in love with you, but you aren't in love with her. You like her, you care about what happens to her, but you are not in love with her. 

Part of the reason that your sex life is lacking is that you don't really sleep with her out of love, but out of obligation. 

Marriage would be a mistake. You don't love her. You know she loves you. Eventually you will have to either participate in additional  deception or explain that you really don't want what she has to offer. 

Perhaps I am being too blunt. I am reading your responses and paying close attention to what you say. 

&gt;She's still very much in love with me and I love being with her, but .......

Dude....get out before you make a horrible mistake. "
"  You are a hateful intolerant human being. I don’t expect much else from this sub, however."

"So he attacked you with one slur so you stoop to his level and call him a slur back and have the nerve to be mad? Girl, THAT is hypocrispy."
SAME! Wow. Yes. 
"I’ve found doing guided meditation helps me put things into perspective. I used to be insecure in my own skin and getting a bit older somehow exacerbated it. Thinning hair. Gaining a bit of weight. Getting grey hairs. Getting wrinkles.

Then I tried meditation on one of our well-being sessions at work. At first I thought it was silly, then my anxiety and low self esteem got worse. So there I was, doing a few sessions of guided meditation.

Did it completely fix my self judgement and self doubt? Not really. But at least now I am able to recognize when I start being judgemental then I slowly remind myself I’m actually ok."
Yes! I love it :)
Well i am not encouraging it either. 
"Life is too short to ask for apologies or to explain to people that they were hurtful. Especially full-grown adults. He knows very well what he said, how he meant it, and how it was received. The best thing you can do is put this behind you and never look back. Move on with your life knowing you have your chosen family (your husband, your friends) and your adoptive family (your in-laws). Make no room in your life and don't spare even a second for people who won't love you and support you unconditionally; especially knowing that there are so many people who do. Someday, hopefully, your father will look back and realize what a grave mistake he made casting you out of his life like that. He might even apologize. Whether you accept that apology or not is 100% up to you. But if it were me, and I happen to be going through a somewhat similar situation, I wouldn't accept it. Being cast out, belittled, and embarrassed by an adult who knew 100% the power of their words is enough to permanently sever a relationship. Any remorse that he ends up feeling is too little, too late. Let him live with the guilt that he is wholly responsible for severing the relationship he had with his son. Before I get any backlash, I know it sounds petty. But until you're in that position where you're being tossed away like trash by someone who you used to look up to, someone who was your hero and who you thought would love you unconditionally, you don't know what it feels like. Like another poster said, we don't get to choose our family. But we do get to choose to remove them from our lives if they are ignorant, toxic people. "
"It is not your responsibility to “make this right”. 

Dan Savage recommends giving parents who have trouble with this one year to wrap their minds around it and to adjust their behavior. That means for a short period of time, you allow them to Get it out of their system, make inappropriate comments, ask stupid questions, etc. If they make a snide remark or insult, you can call it out And make it clear that is the type of comment that will potentially end your relationship as you go forward. 

There are resources for your father. There is Pflag  And if he is interested in continuing to have a part in your life, he should probably see a therapist who is gay friendly and has had clients like him before.  If he is interested in continuing to have any role in your life, you can discuss this with him and maybe even help him find one. If he bristles at the idea, point out that it doesn’t necessarily have to be an on going thing but he can spare a few hours of his life to talk this through with the professional. Because this is his issue, not yours. Literally millions of other dad’s have been in this situation, experience the feelings he is feeling and gotten the fuck over it. Tell him you appreciate that he is making an effort and if he wants you to continue to be in his life, He’s going to need to make a little bit more of an effort and get some help doing it because he is not processing this well on his own"
Somewhere between your fourth and sixth vodka tonic. 
"If you had a good time, then that's all that matters.  
Don't worry about how he felt because you'll never know for sure, only he knows.  
If you both do meet up again, that's a good sign that he enjoyed himself as well.  
I will say that your ""best of luck"" message sounded to me a little dismissive, like I would interpret that as you're trying to let me know you aren't interested in seeing me again.  
Perhaps a better way to put it to send a clearer message that you want to meet up again is ""looking forward to hearing how your internship is going.""  
Perhaps given that and now you're reaching out to him again he's feeling like you're sending conflicting messages.  
You could just explain to him exactly the situation you're in, like ""wasn't sure how the date went and wanted to wish you luck but maybe came off like I didn't want to talk again. Sorry about the confusion, but I want to be clear that would be great if you'd be up for meeting me again."""

"I’ve been where you are. Twice. Both of my partners had a family that treated me better than my own kin. The last partner died in 2008 and I’m still considered part of the family. I love my nieces &amp; nephews so much. The 3 grown boys of my partner’s sister still call me “Uncle (insert name)” because I was the one that sat at the kids table on holidays, talked about comics, and colored Easter eggs with them. Act like family and you will BE family. "
Hell yeah. Would bang.
"Some guys love it, but not often, and usually it leaves me frustrated."
His dad didn't say it was unnatural because that's what God said. Just that it's unnatural. 
"We were having a conversation about what monogamy meant to us, individually, and it just kind of happened from there. We joke that we almost fell into an open relationship by accident!

Like u/philthymon we talked a lot around defining sexual exclusivity, sex vs love, envy and all that. Then we drew up the rules.

Then we sat with the idea for a couple of weeks before either of us did anything. Neither of us wanting to do anything hasty that would be inadvertently destructive.

I'll shortcut it: in my opinion, you've both got to genuinely be in the same place on some really important stuff (some of which has nothing to do with sex) for it to work. Communication needs to be excellent. You need a very particular, flexible kind of trust. And you have to stick to any rules you agree to.

Read Esther Perel's books, she's got a smart take around this stuff. And Rewriting the Rules by Meg-John Barker."
I could. One day maybe. For some reason there’s some internal shame of being interested at all. 
"I know this 6'3"" bear. He's like a rugby player. He's not exactly straight passing but he's pretty masculine, and rough.

"One line I take very seriously in the marriage vows are the words, ""forsaking all others"".  I would head on down the road with my husband, and not even give a glance back."

"Maybe if I were blind I’d date someone who wasn’t better looking than me. But I’m not, so...yeesh."
If anything that would make a date even hotter.
"Well, it's great to hear you are protecting your child. I'm sorry you married poorly. I believe that divorce attorneys are relatively inexpensive. You don't deserve to be married to her and your son does not deserve to have that influence. Contact a family law attorney and let them take care of all future interactions. This is about your son's and your safety. Let her figure it out."
The fact they let you in to the home just to then stand up and embarrass you then kick you out would turn me off to ever talking to him again. Sorry this happened to you.
You can block a phone number too.  Sorry. But I’m not gonna hook up with you if we only chat on the app.

"My jaw is still on the floor, well at least you have your husband and his family. It may not feel the same but in due time you’ll see they’ll feel like fam. For some parents it may take a long time and other will never accept but that’s the beauty of it all we can make our own family. Sometimes our close friends are like family. "
"Well.....if dating is out of the questions, can't do sports because of  asthma, can't do activities like sports because you don't like them, and you live in a small town where they don't have groups and stuff......

And....if you keep doing what you have always done, you will continue to get what you have always gotten.  "
"But as I said, I dont fit in with the LGBTQ population anyways because im very reserved compared to them. So what would moving to a city matter in that regard? Not too mention I have no idea how people even afford to live in the city, its so expensive!"

"It sounds tough- I'm sorry. 

Say nothing for now. If one day you get a job elsewhere and it feels like a good idea you could say something. 'I'm gay- I've had to listen to you two spew bile about me and it's just made me feel terrible. Good Christian behavior, fuck you both.'"
"I'm 41 almost 42 with a very similar background. I only just recently came out of a very deep depression. Basically for the last 6 years I have been going to work and coming home to lie on my couch in the fetal position.  I just recently started going to a gay bar to hang out. I don't particularly like hanging out in bars but it does help fight the loneliness just being amongst people.  I sit and listen while sipping my drink, get hit on on occasion. There actually seem to some genuinely nice folks there as well. I wish I had done it years ago. It has changed my mindset completely just being around other like minded individuals. 

BTW I haven't dated in years, we're talking almost 18 years here. I kept telling myself I'll worry about that after school and then after school it was that I was too busy. Time just passes you by and before you know it a good part of your life is gone and empty.

I encourage you to not follow my example. Get out and do something now, while sipping you can."
Basically your stuck but refuse to do anything differently to fix it. Don't bitch if you're just going to shoot down everyone's advice. If you're not happy change something otherwise shut up and deal with it.

"Girl, I get it. My boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic so we don’t do the bar scene. But that’s not the only way gay people interact. There are lots of people like you and me. And honestly you are coming off a little closed minded thinking all gay people are extroverts, that’s not true. Your post says your stuck, people in the comments are suggesting realistic ways to help, you seem to be rejecting all of them. So why even post this? It’s your life and nothing will change unless you change it. You have to try to be more optimistic. "
Thank you for sharing your story. Well I'm not dating for a reason because lets just say it was more detrimental than beneficial for me.
You must be so fun at parties. 
"Depends on the situation. I have a very short refractory period, so if the sex is exceptionally good (rarely), then I'm keen to get going again. Otherwise, I'm satisfied with just once :)"

You might seek out a counselor who can help you work through this stuff. 
"I dont know if it's normal, but I have been there and still kinda am. I'm 28, and everyone I know is either married with kids, or still into the club scene. I was beginning to wonder if it was just me, and being from a smaller town "
And but u didnt even address what I was saying tho aside from telling me to date. I'm sure dating won't cure loneliness.
Most of the guys you see in porn  take Viagra and they have assistance with arousals
It ensures the safety of the people INSIDE the club by having better security measures. 
I don’t fully understand why so many young gays have low self esteem problems but it seems to be pretty common on this sub. Internalized homophobia maybe. It could also be that hookups just aren’t your thing. 
There are actually gay animals lol
while bottoming?
How did he cum mostly then?
Oh yes. He came hands free every time. I once made him cum by eating his ass. So orgasmic.
"Wow thats awesome. Wish I could bottom like that, was always lousy at it sadly"
It may not be you.  Not all gay guys know how to give great head.
"I have soooooooo many family members that have married in that will forever be my family no matter what. A sister-in-law that I can talk to for hours compared to my brother (her husband) who I don't have much in common with. I have a step-mom who's helped me through so much. Her cousins and aunts and uncles who after years of knowing me don't blink an eye. My SO and I have been together for years and his brother and mom will often reach out to me about things that I find out they never mentioned to my SO. 
You might not be on the inside yet, but lean in. Found family is amazing. "
"Hi /r/gaybros 

I'm a firm supporter of LGBTQ rights, and absolutely believe that there are homophobic, racist MAGA thugs in this country, but the journalist in me is skeptical.  I thought you might be interested in this write up I did about the story.

Now that more evidence has emerged, it's time we reexamine the situation, and ask ourselves some critical questions without letting potential biases influence our thinking.

**The Letter:**

A letter is mailed to Fox Studios in Chicago, a few days before the alleged attack.  [Here is a picture of the letter and the envelope](https://www.tmz.com/2019/01/30/jussie-smollett-declined-extra-security-homophobic-racist-attack/).  It may have been the same letter that contained a white powder, later determined to be aspirin, or it may be a different letter, it's unclear.  This leads to a number of questions.

1. *Why is the letter a mixture of cut out letters, and human writing?*  My guess is the letter creator took his time cutting out letters to make the threat, then realized he still needed to address the front of the envelope to get it delivered.  He couldn't use ""terrorist letters"" like on the inside, USPS would intercept it.  So he grabs a marker, holds it like a hammer, and scribbles the address, then adds some crude pictures to the letter on the inside.

2. *Why did the letter writer forget how to write the letter ""L"", using a backwards version for the second ""L"" in his name?*  My guess is that the author was deliberately trying to seem uneducated or stupid.  Along with the ""MAGA"" as a return address, it seems the author is working very hard to make it seem like a semi-illiterate Trump supporter sent the message.

3. *Why is Smollett's name in the letter so different then the rest of the letters?*  The majority of the message is in the form of cut out letters, from something like a magazine.  I'd actually speculate the ""You"" is from a greeting card.  Look at the ""SMOLLETT JUSSIE"" part.  That looks like a label maker.  So why not use the same label maker to write the whole letter?  Only one answer makes sense, the author doesn't have the machine that made the label.  My guess is that the author actually used a label that was on something that Smollett owned or used.

4. *Why use cut out letters at all, why not scribble the whole thing?*  As I'd said in #1, maybe the author didn't think through the addressing.  There is also the possibility that the author assumed the letter should look like a typical TV show's ""terrorist letter"".  The cut out letters give it a much more cynical vibe and it looks better on screen than if it had all been scribbles.


**The Alleged Attack**

Smollett reported being attacked at 2am, Tuesday, near a residence in downtown Chicago, where he either lives or stays when in town.  He claims that the attackers knew his identity, struck him in some way, put a noose or rope around his neck, and poured some chemical substance on him, possibly bleach.  He later reports that they yelled ""MAGA"".

1. *How likely is it that the letter mailer and the alleged attacker are different groups/people?*  It seems pretty unlikely that two different groups would target him, and since the letter wasn't made public till after the attack, it can't be a copy cat.

2. *How did they know where to send the letter?* This would not have been to difficult to figure out.  I googled it and got the location of the studio right away.

3. *How did they know he was in Chicago at all?* Again, easy, he tweeted about being in the city when his plane landed earlier.

4. *How did they know where he lived?*  Here's where it gets weird.  Unlike the studio location, you can't just google his name and get this address where he was attacked.

5.  *Even if they found out the address, how did they know he was going to come out of an unmarked side entrance to the building, far from the main entrance, and out of sight of it, at 2am, in below zero temperatures?*  I have no explanation for how this could be possible.

6.  *How were they so familiar with the location that they picked one of the only locations in the area where camera's couldn't see?* Maybe they got extremely lucky or did reconnaissance of the area for cameras?  Both seem very unlikely.

7. *How did they manage to get into and out of the area without being picked up on nearly any camera, when Smollett himself is on multiple cameras all the way from the Subway back to the residence?*  Because the cops are looking for people in the area around the time of the alleged attack, not 30 minutes later, or whenever the real attacker left the area.

8.  *Who was the mystery ""associate"" who was at the residence with Smollett when he returned after being attacked?*  The ""associate"" has not been mentioned in the police reports as being present when they arrived.  Smollett's manager who now claims to have been on the phone with him clearly wasn't there at the time.

9. *Isn't the ""associate"" the only logical person who could have committed the attack, if it happened?*  The ""associate"" would have already been at the residence, knew when and where Smollett would be, and would have been able to avoid all of the cameras, because he was already there.  

10. *Why wait 45 minutes to call the cops?*  Because they needed time for the ""associate"" to make his get away.  My theory is the attack actually took place inside the residence, and was committed by the ""associate"".  The delay was to give him time to get out of the area, so the cops didn't find him.  

So anyway, that's my arm-chair investigation.  Feel free to poke holes in it.  As I said in the earlier post, I do not doubt for one minute that there are racist, violent, homophobic MAGA thugs running around, but this incident as reported is extremely suspicious.

Edit 1:

**The Video**

Police have reported they have a series of videos of the area that show Smollett leaving Subway, disappearing from any camera for about 1 minute, during which he said the encounter took place, and reemerging on another camera before being seen entering the residence.  They are claiming that when he appeared after the alleged attack, he had the rope/noose around his neck and had road salt on his sweater and no where else.

1.  *Why didn't he have road salt on his pants, shoes or in other locations?* My theory is because he never hit the ground.  He most likely removed his sweatshirt, rubbed it on the ground, then put it back on.  I'm also speculating at this point that the rope/noose was possibly part of the sweatshirt.

2. *Why is a local Chicago reporter [claiming](https://twitter.com/RaferWeigel/status/1091460453388017666) that the Chicago PD thinks it's a hoax?*

I'm not comparing my life, where did you even get that from.

This is absolutely a comparison. Who cares what they’re doing, why even mention it if you’re not thinking “Look what they’re doing and here I am”? What are you doing to pull yourself out of this pity party? 

&gt;And I never said I can't do this or that. 

Yes, you did:

You’re obviously just here to bitch and moan, not seek help. If you don’t stop this pity party you’re throwing for yourself you’ll still be in this hole five years from now. Your choice, I personally don’t give a shit.

"The amount of love you are pouring into making sure your son is supported, protected and free to be himself is amazing. Thank you for sharing with everyone here.
Your son will have many years to show you how completely grateful he is to you for sticking by him. Your wife won’t have nearly as many years with him if she keeps this up. She has to live with that regret! 

Now the both of you have this incredible bond, something that really shows just how much you both care for one another, that he was able to confide in you and that you didn’t even flinch at accepting and loving him. How amazing is it going to be to have this new relationship with your son where he is authentically himself? That person is going to grow into such a vibrant, resilient guy with deep empathy for people who are confronted with making very tough choices. All thanks to you!"

Sorry dude... but if you don't know what 'masculinity' generally means... you're an idiot.  But I think you DO know what he means... and you're just trying to make some vague point about who know what.  Masculinity is not a 'vague' concept.  
You are an amazing father. That doesn't always feel good but you are good. Your son is lucky to be have you ❤️
Its a pragmatic thing to consider. She might try for custody to 'fix' her son. First thing to work through with the lawyer is establishing the basis for full custody.
"Your wife is mentally ill.

This is the behavior of a person with a personality disorder.

Look up narcissism and borderline personality disorder.

Classic case.

"So story time. I’m 28. I came out to my parents when I was around 15. I came out to the world at the same time. For me it wasn’t difficult to accept. It maybe took a week. It came to me in a dream when I was 13 that I was making out with this guy. I’ve been depressed and that morning I woke up feeling great. Sure it was confusing and weird but I figured out what was causing my pain. 

I don’t remember exactly how it started, but I was sad and my mom asked what was wrong. This was a little over two years after I admitted it to myself. I had the obligatory straight friend crush. This guy called David. Anyways, I told her I was in love with a guy. Took me a while to do it since I started crying. She held me and told me it was ok. That she loved me. The next day her inner catholic kicked in and she dumped a bottle of holy water on me as I was coming out of the shower. Eventually I learned she told my dad. Eventually, so now, she’s fine with it. We don’t discuss it much, but she cares for me. Like she saw recently the assasinatikn of Gianni Versace and told me to be careful of psychos. Creepy but cute in a way.

My dad on the other hand. I never told him directly. My mom told me she’d handle it. Which resulted in my dad never mentioning my personal life ever again. It’s been 13 fucking years. I still see them. He’s fine, we talk about anything except my life. About business, politics, current events, the weather, whatever but my personal life. I chose not to rub it in his face and let it be.

My sister told me she loved me no matter what and is cool with it. My brothers didn’t care either. One even told me he thought I was an asshole before coming out and liked me a lot better since I did. "
"Is it me or did this go sideways fast?  

I think Closeted Masculine guys are probably not yet at ease with their homosexuality, and it’s easier for them to accept someone they view like themselves, instead of a more expressively out gay man, who might also bring attention to the closeted guy.  

I think straight appearing (read: Masculine) guys often don’t get hit on because who knows if they are gay?

More interesting to me is this; are we at or near a time when we feel comfortable just asking any guy under 40 if he is gay, because even if he is not, he’s more likely to have a gay friend or relative and has become comfortable with gays, and therefore it offended by the question, and the often implied compliment?"
Not really. People gawk at my chest and arm scars but it's always a fun storytime when that happens
Welp. Now I know why he's gay and why she left.
"I am really glad your son has you. My mom is very evangelical and finds being gay the worst thing ever. I came out almost 20 years ago, and it has been a rough go. While we work to maintain a relationship in which we text every so often and talk on the phone once every 4-6 weeks, I will never forget the awful things she has said to me over the years (all in the name of religion). Thank you for being there for your son!  "

You are just being petty now and playing with semantics.  What I mean by  masculine is not acting in a way stereotypical of  a gay male in 21st culturally western culture.  
"Sorry you are experiencing so much trouble from the spouse. I shared my ""Life Story"" in a previous message. Just know this. You are absolutely amazing. I also agree, that it is time to start going back to normal house rules that were in place, witht he explanation, you wanted your boy to be able to see you supported him by giving him some extra liberties during this hard time. Now back to the normal routine. Also, maybe if he has a bf, to show you are in full support, take them out to dinner and another social event on a weekend night. That is true support. He will understand that. 

You basically reestablish house rules, but soften the blow with a very meaningful supportive act that I personally think will mean even more to him."

"Long story short. 

I live in a very conservative country and I'm discreet about my sexuality. I dated a guy a few months back and it turned out to be an emotionally, physically, and financially abusive relationship. Dumped and blocked him. He shows up again months later using my picture without my consent on gay dating apps and extorting me for money since I'm not out. Being gay is a big ’no no’ in this country. You could get jailed here and technically killed if/when sharia law is followed.  

Sorry for not being clear in my post. "
"The ideal solution would be to have him killed, but I realise that’s difficult. The next best thing is to never speak to that man again, and that’s what you should do."
"Yeah, it's pretty tough. Even in the US, the South Asian community treats homosexuality as a massive taboo, so people just aren't out. I assume the majority of Indian gays just choose to hide it, marry a woman and live that life - not sure how they manage to make it work. 

There was a period where I was kinda like you, preferring to find someone with a similar cultural background. Not necessarily for me, but because I knew my family would be devastated when they found out about my gayness but maybe it could be massaged if my boyfriend was also Indian. But 1) that was a pretty lousy reason for me to have a racial preference and 2) there are like 0 out gay Indians out there in the first place. And dating a closeted one would probably just end poorly once he decided to cave in a get himself married to a girl to please the parents. 

Yeah...so now just dating a white guy. He's great."
"Honestly, I'm not just speaking for myself. A lot of us here are tolerant af. And by the way I saw that shady fucking edit. So you think I act like a little bitch,? How about you give good advice or leave? Cause it seems you are only here to cause drama."

And my dick would just be a distraction from that pleasure. I also top how I like bottom. Just saying. "
"You should choose your son over your wife. Like said in other comments, your son needs you way more than your wife does.

"I am a gaymer. I have an online guild and online friends. I also do in real life stuff as well. I can't really get into the party scene. I am sober and don't drink.

I can do it, but prefer not to hang for ever at one, prefer to be at a place where drinking is not the focus and where it isn't quite so ""cruisey"". "
That is 100% true and I am well aware of this flaw. Your point is well taken. Thank you for ur insight. 
"I edited my message after your posted, but I'll paste the edit here so you see it.

EDIT: Just seen you already tried it. I'm gonna level with you. We cannot tell you how to improve your life, only you can decide on something to change what you're currently doing, because continuing as you are won't make you feel better by itself. Think of something you've always wanted to do and find a way to do that thing. I always wanted to ice skate and my nearest rink was 2 hours away, but I made the trip regularly because I had always wanted to do it. The commute to do it was a pain, but I loved being on the ice, which made it worth it. Plus I made new friends through the rink, which was cool.

Find something you want to do and find a way to make it work. We cannot tell you what it is that interests you, just look into yourself and don't just find reasons not to do something. You are unlikely to improve if you do something, but you also don't risk very much by trying something - you waste a few hours and maybe a bit of money and you'll either love whatever new thing you tried and find something to do and meet people, or you'll hate it and you'll have lost a few hours and some money, no big deal."
Fuck. That’s one of my biggest fears about coming out to my family is that my brother won’t let me see my niece and nephew.

I wish my parents were more like you
"You are an amazing father, Sir. You have done what every parent should do; you put the child before the spouse. Too many people let the kid suffer because they don't want to upset their wife or husband, but you have done the absolute right thing here. And as far as you feeling like you ""gave up"" or ""broke"", what you've been doing here takes strength and maturity. It would be way easier for most people to pretend everything was fine and to compromise on something they had no business compromising on. When you love someone it is that much harder to let go, not easier. It takes a lot of energy to allow yourself to give up, and a big part of you knows that she is not, for the time being, salvageable as a mother or a wife. There is no shame in acknowledging that she has chosen herself over her family; you simply accepted her resignation and escorted her out of the building."
"I don’t know if this helps you any but, when I was 5 my parents got divorced because my mother was having an affair (she needed up marrying the guy) and this wasn’t the first time he had caught her.  My parents were completely transparent about their divorce and neither of us blamed ourselves in any way because they were honest. Honest about a lot more than they probably should have been at the time. Just be honest with your son. If her reaction and behavior is the reason, tell him exactly that and then explain why in detail why it is unacceptable to you. If it’s for other reasons, tell him those. From what I’ve read he sounds very level headed and mature enough to be told the truth. 

I’m very sorry about your situation. I know words don’t do much, but I hope you can start healing soon. 


Like many have already said, your son is very lucky to have you. I wish I had advice on how to handle his mother, but my family reacted the same was as you did when I came out. However, my mother and I don’t speak. As far as mending the relationship between mother and son, I would let them do it themselves. Stay neutral. I would steer clear of saying anything to defend her actions or make them seem less hurtful. My mother is a terrible mother, and an even worse human being. We never had a good relationship but everyone in my family, except my father, always defended her shitty actions or words. They made excuses and guilted me into allowing her to continue doing the things she was doing. It was until recently (I’m 26 now. For timeline purposes) that I decided to stop listening to everyone else and think for myself. And when I did that I cut ties with my mom. 

I’m sorry, I guess the point of that whole thing was this: no matter how many timesI explained my feelings, no one really understood how I felt about my mom, or the magnitude of the damage and pain she has caused. Only I did. And if I was just given the opportunity to really think about it without outside influence, I could have made a decision that was best for me, and my mental health, 10+ years sooner.

You're correct; New Jersey is home to a lot of pharma companies and it only makes sense that senator would support one of the largest employers in their state. However, big pharma has a pretty bad rep (rightfully so) so it becomes very easy to say ""hey, this man is bad because he supports big pharma!"" which is probably one of the major reasons why Booker won't fair too well in the first place.

"I wish my parents cared half as much about me as you do for your son. I'd suggest finding a lawyer who can help with the potential religious problem.

You've done more already than most. You might still want to considercounseling both for yourself and son. I can't speak for him obviously, but I have always been extremely guilty of being gaybecause of my parents religious upbringing. If they divorced over it I would take complete fault."
It's mostly about voice and mannerisms. Let's not overthink things.
"I used to be Mormon, and when I came out my 2 brothers wrote me off like I didn't exist anymore. I don't really care. I have lots of other caring people in my life to make up for it. It's their loss. It's funny how they bash me for ""choosing to be gay"" and that I'm a sinner when they are temple workers who still drink and smoke pot and are lousy fathers. Go figure! It's not your job to turn your family around, just live your life how you please and let them accept you at their own pace. My father said of all his kids(5) I was the most disapointing. Yet all of my sibings have either been arrested and gone to jail, been disfellowshipped or excommunicated, had alcohol and drug problems, and been abusive. I was a model child. Never got in trouble, Eagle scout, temple marriage, missionary, etc. Yet the church sees me as the one in spiritual trouble. The church is messed up! Don't let them ruin your outlook on life, Jesus would never treat a gay person like the members do today. They are hypocrites. Good luck.
