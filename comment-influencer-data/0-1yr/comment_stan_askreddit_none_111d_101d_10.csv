"I heard about some youtube/streamer drama from a reddit thread awhile ago, essentially some guy was sending a streamer 2k a month or something close to that. 

Turned out she was married the whole time but always said on stream that she was single.

Dude got pissed and dropped her only to go stan for some other streamer chick...ðŸ¤¡"
