"I have been to lots of them, the only thing I can count on is shitty service."
So original
I agree but the guy made 3 glaring errors that even elementary school kids learn. Not saying hes a fraud just that it is funny after you saying this. Asking an egyptologist about the pyramids is like asking a computer science major to fix your pc. He really should have just said he doesnt know much about the pyramids. That is perfectly ok because egyptology is about so so so so so much more than pyramid construction.
So my friends gf has a degree in Egypt ology but not the masters yet. She keeps saying she can't do anything but work at McDonald's untill she's saved for the masters. I'm like why not go for a call center or somthing anything better she says no but that's by the by. What could she do in the meantime? Nd also what's the point in Egypt ology these days unless you are an Egyptian really? It's soooo very specific.
Abolish Apple and Fortinite and that is it
"Lol, it's funny when Trump supporters try to twist these threads to whine about their persecution complex."
r/unexpectedoffice
I banged your mom
Yet apple will never adopt because they want all special shit for their phones
"Your acting like that stuff happens in a civilised country. Maybe in America, but most of us have legislated that kind of abuse out of existence."
I mean Trump doesn’t really do anything. The real issue is his administration who is slowly ignoring and/or rolling back various civil rights laws while everyone gets distracted by the presidents twitter.
"I bet most of them get off on the fact they have a guy friend with a crush on them, power lust. A lot of women are evil like that."
Tendies?
"vanilla, classic sucks"
You should have thought about your parents and snapped yourself into a job and an apartment.
"In certain cases like what op mentioned where crime is indisputable, execution is right. Its just, its moral, it's natural and it's  the best of all conceivable  solutions. Whether state does it or a vigilante, it doesn't matter. Killing off a monster is compassion and an act of love actually ."
I'm not even black and I prefer this. Just a shame I can't say it myself.
"no hablo faggotese, dumbass"
"I think by the ages of 55 and 48, you are no longer boyfriend and girlfriend but the propper pronunciation would be partner."
Why mention porn in all this? What about romance novels - aren't they porn?
I’m not a nig. You racist fuck!

Yeah wtf? And I can’t believe your comment is at the bottom of this chain... like this is what the people need to know!
"&gt;  Plus the early 2010 were a time where online forms weren't that common either. 

hard not true"
"Not only that, but vocal groups on the far left encourage and applaud black people attacking white people for saying it"
"The same reason I hate Clinton. Shamelessly using political power to interfere with the justice system, pqthalogical lying and using their position for financial gain. Just to name a few.

As much as people like to say otherwise, trump really is just another politician. Democrat or Republican, they're all evil."
"You know most diamonds are industrial purpose only, right? Like. A huge majority of diamond isn't even usable for jewelery."
White boys shooting up public places...I don't even look up when i hear the breaking news. I know who did it.
"Nobody is hitting on her? in the original comment was: 

Person 1: I don't know what they think of me 

Person 2: Probably thinking 'I wish I could ask her out'

Person 3: She's working doesn't want to be hit on 

No where in this arc did anybody actually do anything but think. Do women get to be immune to social interaction because they are at work?  If somebody meets somebody in the work place is there no room to potentially explore a relationship?   And lets not forget in this example nobody has said or done anything - and probably won't. 

But to the larger point - men aren't people, and should keep all that shit bottled up.  And  the worst case scenarios are the only ones worthy of consideration."
Wow this is a toxic question.
"Insert * is this some poor people joke that I am too rich to understand* meme /s 
Don’t downvote me, just have cheap mobile internet here."

Definitely read this to the tune of that one Cardi B song
"They are not innacurate at all.

The sex in porn is not the kind of sex you would have with your partner, but it is the kind of sex you have with a whore.

Is it a lie? Maybe, but who cares?"
Upvotes I’ll never get in real life
rGDP per capita in 1960 was the number i stated. Do you want to explain how median incomes were much higher than mean incomes in 1960 or do you want to rethink what you are doing or your sources?
100% correct. Women will read several pages describing in exquisite detail every facet of a man's penis and what he's doing with it but a minority of women want to just see a picture of a penis.
The heck do you even mean?.No shit people are warned when they eat crap food.Men and women alike get called on it.
"My gf does this all the time.

**EXCITING NEWS**

I ask question

**SILENCE WHILE SHE TEXTS HER FAM EXCITEDLY**

It's really snobby to expect her to devote all of her attention to you when her attention is clearly divided equally among a number of important parties.

This doesn't even touch on how she might also be texting her best friends the news."
Pooping out the wrong hole can cause severe stinky breath
"If we want to compare we can find 100 pros and cons of any generation. 
Nobody is “blaming” us. They just say that we are a shitty generation. Which we are, indeed. That’s a statement. Blaming would be “you are a shitty generation...and you are the reason that the world is so messed up”. We don’t have responsibility yet, we are slowly taking it."
"It may be too fucked up, but I do enjoy a good hand holding on the occasion"
"I share their opinion. Please do me! Oh let me save you some time.

I wish Shyamalan had been allowed to finish the trilogy.
Yeah. I’m a girl and the thought of certain not-so-attractive ladies rubbing one out makes me shudder.
"All I did was be honest with her. I don't see this as labeling at all. What is so wrong with being honest? The reason I told her that I have autism is because I wanted to be honest but I guess thats not fucking good enough for bitches these days! I don't care if I get downvoted for this! Because fuck you and fuck daiting! I'm completely done with ""normal"" people thinking I'm stupid! All of you can go to fucking hell!"

They're only aware of what the main stream media wants them to be aware of.
Thanos....overpopulation is a big issue.
Thanos...overpopulation's going to be a huge problem in the near future.
Not entirely correct. Millinial is used for different age ranges. There isn't one standard definition of the word.
"Its not hard to get into college. Part of the problem is that literally anyone can get into college. You dont even need to be able to read anymore.

Removing the artificial inflation from the price tag of a college degree would be one of the best things we could do for our economy and for our people. Debt slavery has caused wages to stagnate and quality of life to decrease."
"I thought this was gonna be the first reply but I can't find it so . . .

"&gt; conversely, believing that corporations will self-regulate and aren't trying to screw you over for a quick dime at every opportunity

But Ronald Reagan was a bastard tho...
Lmao it's honestly hilarious watching people attack you for this comment. You clearly worked hard and came from not so great conditions and still made it. They all envy you and feel bad about themselves because they're probably coming from much better conditions and still can't make it. Shit's sad.
"You're getting downvoted.  I'll explain.  This post is largely a circle jerk of ""fuck the economy because I don't have it easy.""  So, if you waltz in here and be all ""I'm 33 and make 75K in an area where 200K buys a perfectly fine house"" then yeah...you're going to get downvoted.  It doesn't matter what you make, your friends, my cousin who is a doctor making 400K at age 34....this post is about complaining about society."

Gen X has money and had to adapt to tech.  I've been programming since I was eight; it's always been there.

"Which field are you in, the one that would be replacing programmers, or the one that would be replaced?  


I'm not convinced it'll be a 'long long time.'  In fact I'm convinced the amount of time is unknowable because, afaict, we already have the ability to give machines intuition and the only thing we lack for AI to come out swinging is cross domain knowledge application.  So as far as I'm concerned we're one good discovery away from AI that people should be worried about.  Couple that with existing robotics technology and the only job I think humans will be better suited for than machines will be places far off the grid that don't have access to energy.  And I only say that because I'm not convinced that it physics will allow for portable energy sufficient to run robot bodies indefinitely.  But it's possible biological robots could be created that could live off food like humans do."
"If a woman thinks you want to bang her, don't pay any mind, drives her crazy. Watch what they do to answer the question."
That is why your generation does not get promoted at my office as fast as GenXers. You ASSUME that since technology has altered business you believe EVERYTHING from the past is obsolete. Alas it has not. Including social graces. Hence why we pass over you people after you are done with your internships for qualified and more experienced people willing to learn as well as teach.
"Sure, I got nailed. But, I needed the work. Any really poor person will tell you that a job is a job. THe paycheck is almost an idol, to be worshiped. So, we did what we needed to do. 

Now, some of the kids today might NOT be taken advantage of because they are smarter than I'll ever be. But, they are hungry and broke too. Only difference is, my pride took a backseat to my my duty as oldest child. Then it took a backseat to me wanting a car. Took a backseat to me being married with kids and a dog. Turns out, fuck my pride. I found out my pride is providing for my family. Ever scar on my hands, every kink in my back is all worth providing. Kids are grown and they are dicks. Marrige sucks. Life sucks. But I tried."

"&gt;By taking out loans, and, again, spending money that I don't have??

"Because they don't care about the ""child"", they care about controlling women and telling them what to do with their bodies."

"he is 17 and struggling? I think  maybe he isnt the one who  needs the help.  ADHD is not a debilitating disease, its EASILY worked around.  heck there are entire college that specialize in it and  in most cases taking notes on a laptop is a  great way to overcome a lot of the issues. The only thing that cant be overcome is if parents enable the  ADHD."
Definitely. Then we can get gas cans and appliances that work.
"But when a product is labeled as ""organic"", the FDA does not have a specific definition that a product must follow to have that word on its label, so i could use all the pesticides in the world on a cabbage plant, label it organic and mark it up 200%."

It's a joke
"It was a joke, son!"
"i dont like putting things in/on my body when i dont know what it is or what it does. also, (simple) things that we eat dont need 10++ ingredients. if a product has (too) many ingredients, i dont buy it. usually its more processed (=bye bye flavor and nutrients) and has re-added flavor and nutrients (aka salt, flavor enhancers, aromas). but i generally eat/cook from quite raw/unprocessed stuff that looks like mother nature created it and not a factory.

also: i dont buy sauces with xanthan. its water + color + aroma + thickening agent = sauce (???????????). thats a big cheat here. so knowing what ingredients are can help you make better choices.

but i have a chemist/pharmaceutical background and am generally a very curious person and like learning new things."
"Selling products that you do not understand is extremely unethical. How can you gauge if it's a suitable investment for your client? I understand that there are pressures to sell but I guarantee that your employer would be extremely concerned by your comment. I suggest you either take it upon yourself to thoroughly understand the products you sell, or just change fields to ensure that your lack of curiosity doesn't negatively impact someone's life savings."
"Watch me attack this person because they made a point I dont agree with

Why is this getting downvoted?
"I'm 55. I penny pinched for 10 years back in my 20's to be able to afford a down payment, in a dual income household. And we realized that we'd never afford a place in California, so we moved from LA to Indiana then to Detroit to afford anything.  So what the fuck are you bitching about? Man, talk about seeing the past with rose colored glasses . . . you are *convinced* that everybody before you lived in days of wine and roses, right?  Oh, and the house we're in now? Our ""move up"" house, big enough for kids . . . it's appreciated a whopping 15% since we bought it in 2001.

It's like the narrative you guys are pushing just seems like a lot of bullshit to me. Bitch, bitch, bitching about how bad you have it, but the BS you find it necessary to compare yourself to is always a 3000 square foot house in LA or SF or NY.  So many responses of ""oh, sure I could afford a place in X, but then *I'd have to live in X*.""  

And then you wonder why no one older than you have any sympathy.

Fuck, reading through the constant self-pity in this entire thread would be funny if it wasn't so sad."
So you want the ability to have sex but don't worry about the outcome? I always hear that a women should know if she has sex that a child might be the outcome. What about the man? Doesn't he have any responsibility? You think the women should be forced to give birth and then if you don't want anything to do with it you can just walk away? Doesn't sound like pro life to  me. Sounds like pro birth. If you don't like the idea that a women controls her own body then don't have sex or else make sure you are the one that prevents conception.
The fact that you asked this question makes me feel sorry for you.
You got a lot of learnin' to do.
