"At first we just told them we met at a cowboy bar during the free dance classes. Seemed sweet and all Hallmark-ish. In reality, I got stood up by my blind date who was set up by my friend and her BF.  The dance class I thought was for line dancing (don't need a partner) was for the cowboy waltz, in which a partner is pretty mandatory. Seriously, I was the only one not dancing, so I got drunk. The bouncer found the first single guy who walked in and pointed him in my direction. I got stupid drunk but he stuck it out and we started dating. Married 27 yrs this June."
"The gynecologist with fingers from one hand inside me and fingers from the other hand on my abdomen feelin' my organs stopped and said ""Your bladder is about...halfway full"". I was like ""Thanks, I'll take care of that later""."
"My 18 year old daughter met this guy. He seemed sweet kind and loving. He was a little weird so we thought he was just nervous around us but we thought everyone is nervous around parents. He got closer to us. Started calling me mom too. They moved in together. All seemed good except he wasn't working as much as he had been before she moved in. 

My daughter had a chance to go to Disneyland for a week with her tio to help him and his girlfriend with their kids. She left and her boyfriend was taking care of her dog for that week.

She arrived home a day early and found the dog had been home alone all week with no food or water. Pooping everywhere. She broke up with him.

We picked her up he came outside and told me not to let her leave him. I told him not to stress just let her and himself have some time to cool off and then maybe they could talk about it another day. He said ok.

She stayed the night with us. In the morning she said he had been messaging her all night and she wanted to go talk to him to end on good terms and also get her things. We asked if we could go with her or stay in the car waiting she said no she was an adult and could handle it 

I messaged her at 12:30pm and asked how things were she said ""still talking"" then at 12:50pm she messaged ""come get me""

We got there in 8 minutes. Knocked on the door but no one answered called and messaged him and her. No response. Called 911 only to be treated like overprotective parents. Waited and waited outside the apartment went searching for them 

A neighbor seen us and asked why we were standing there I explained the situation. She said oh I saw him kick her and drag her into the apartment at noonish. I called 911 again they basically accused me of exaggerating because of a post I made on a public group on Facebook asking if anyone had seen them. Some stranger had commented I should exaggerate but I didn't .

This new information spurred us to break in. I found my precious sweet daughter dead. Killed by her exboyfriend. 

He did the ultimate betrayal to her by ending her life. We trusted him and he was just a brutal monster hiding behind a gentleman's facade

He took that bouncer seriously when he said that woman needs a partner. I'm imaging your husband being like I guess this is my life now and just going along with it for 27 years.
"\*with the speculum in my vagina*

""You have very nice depth"""
"She always sleeps closer to the wall. Idk why, I guess she just wants to make sure I get stabbed before she does if someone breaks in lol"
"I am white; my partner is dark skinned. I am extremely tired of “stepping in” when he is being held by security/questioned/etc. and literally all I have to do is stand beside him and say, “Is everyone okay?” And “Yeah we are together” and then SUDDENLY: miracle, no issues, we can move on with our lives"
"Bonus round: 

I was having a general STI check.

"I guess this applies but my husband I got married in secret and maybe a handful of people know about our first “wedding.” 

Basically what happened was we got married on whim, told my parents and his dad and planned on easing it to everyone else. Less than a week later his dad was killed in a car wreck and we figured springing “were married!” On his mom wasn’t a good thing. We slowly told her we were *thinking* about getting married and she got really excited to plan a wedding so we just sort of went with it."
"One of the thoughts I had was ""could I be anywhere or in any situation (bad,embarrassing,sad,tense,happy,with family,friends,etc.) and be with them? Would I want them there? Would I feel like I could get through or be anywhere as long as they were by my side?"".

Love is a companionship, a ""partner in crime"", you feel like your awake and you didn't even know you weren't awake before. They treat you with respect and you treat them with respect. You want what's good for them and will make sacrifices and compromises to achieve what's good. It's selfless, it's trusting them, it's being treated well, it's being supported, it's lifting each other up because you and they want to. It's going through life knowing they got your back and you've got their backs, knowing you'll never have to go through life alone. Lastly, you want life with them, you want them, you want it."
"Together 5 years, until one day I discovered the hard way he was a pathological liar. He had downloaded an app to text me and make it look like it was from a different number, and proceeded to use it to pretend a stalker was after me trying to kill me (and would give various details on what I was doing, like the stalker was watching me).

I was relatively “internet famous”, so it wasn’t a stretch to believe I had a stalker (I already got a lot of weird DMs).

Two weeks of not sleeping, talking to the police and starting an investigation, having nonstop brutal panic attacks. All the while, he was comforting me.

When it eventually dawned on me what was happening, I felt heartbroken. I approached him about it, and he was just silent. For some reason, I didn’t cry when we broke up. I was numb.

It was about a month later of this numbness that I recalled a particular detail of the situation that finally made me start crying for the first time. In the middle of one of my panic attacks, the “stalker” was messaging me, and he was comforting me as I was uncontrollably breathing and my heart rate was soaring. While he was comforting me, he sent me a message as the “stalker” further describing how he was going to kill me. This only made the panic attack worse of course, and he clearly did it for this purpose.

I felt so hurt. Five years of a relationship, no warning signs (that I noticed), and then he meticulously plans something that would ultimately leave me with PTSD for 2.5 years afterwards.

I am luckily better now and have fully healed. Thank god he’s no longer in my life."
"Over emphasis on family, using phrases like ""above and beyond"", ""wear many hats"", ""works well under pressure"""
"She says which side she wants, I say ok."
For as long as I can remember I considered it my job to do this for my younger brother as we grew up in a troubled household. I apparently did such a good job that he didn't know how bad things were until he was in his late teens.
"Wasn't a doctor, it was a massage therapist I was seeing at one point after I hurt myself. She was doing some deep muscle work on my upper back and said, ""Huh! You have detached shoulder blades! I've never seen that except in my textbooks. Only 10% of the population has detached shoulder blades!""

I asked what that meant, and in response, she pried up one of my shoulder blades and stuck her fingers under it and wiggled them around. It felt amazing. She said with other people, that wasn't physically possible. So, I guess I'm an anatomical oddity? K, thanks."
"My fiancé and I started dating when we were 22. He was a virgin who had only casually dated a couple of girls and never had a serious girlfriend. In contrast, I became sexually active at 13, lost my virginity at 15, and I had dated a lot of people. 

He is the best person I have ever dated. He’s empathetic, respectful, loving, extremely compatible with me, and great in bed. His inexperience hasn’t caused us any problems at all. We have very open communication, we work together to find solutions to any issues, and we both make a point of actually doing what we say we’re going to do. I think that makes a huge difference."
I'm an interrupter.  Or I was.  I used to listen with an ear for a reply and not listen to understand.  Much different.  I hope I listen more fully now.
He gets warmer than me so he gets the side closer to the AC. I get up more to pee (stupid bladder) so I get the side closer to the bathroom. Works out well for both of us!
"I don't forget *anything*, and I can't let the past die. I'm actively working on remembering that sometimes the past is the past and to focus on what's in front of me right now."

If they have a very high turnover or if they say that you need to be good with “a rapidly changing culture and exponential growth.” That’s how my last company was - I worked there 5 years and the culture was so toxic.
"I have tiny, tiny boobs so I hated wearing anything with a neckline because at least if it were covered, my bra might make them look a little bit bigger.

But then someone complimented me on my collarbones once, and said they look super pretty and feminine. I'd never heard of collarbones looking like anything, but I've gotten the compliment more than once, and it helped me get over the whole neckline thing :)"
"We met at a family reunion.  NOT RELATED.  Good lord, that's why we never tell anyone because they immediately make jokes. I was friends with one of his cousins and she took me to her family reunion.  We hadn't planned on staying the night, but did and my hubby sacrificed his sleeping bag for me. I was hooked from there, even after I left for college. Been married seven years now and I've loved every minute."
Passive aggressive. I can be cruel without realizing it. Short temper. I am not good at a calm debate I always feel attacked.
I’m super self conscious about my broad back and shoulders due to various sports I’ve played and often struggled with being recognised as feminine. The best thing I’ve ever been told is that I looked like Linda Carter did in Wonder woman by an older woman. That felt good.
"It's almost as if relationship experience completely takes a backseat to being a kind, decent, thoughtful individual."
"Yes I have. We connected very deeply and genuinly had a great couple of months. I was his first bed partner, didnt know that at the time btw because he was shy about the fact that he didnt have a gf before me. He told me he loved me and I told him I loved  him. And I truely did. At that time. 

After 4 or 5 months first cracks began to show. He would get clingy and insecure and as a result of that we would get into fights. They were bad eventually became very toxic. One thing was that he would tell me again and again: nobody would love me like he did. He was right. 

Me being the first woman ever telling him she loved him kind of 'imprinted' on him? He convinced himself that because it took him a while to get in to a relationship, this was Meant To Be. And therefor me backing out of the relationship was a plot development like in The Notebook only for us to get back together after I'd realize that his love was all I've searched for all my life. 

We were on and off for a little more than a year. He stopped sending me messages after 5 years. All that time he was busy building a life for me to come home to. It kind of fucked me up and made me scared to tell anyone I love them."

"Once had my gyno ask me, ""Do you work out? You have very firm abs,"" while her fingers were inside me for a pelvic exam. A different gyno told me I have ""very fibrous breasts"" and a crooked cervix. COOL, THANKS."

"I think it's a great idea to pick a ring together, that way you'll be sure that it's a ring you both like. I've heard of enough stories where someone got an awful ring 😅

Also the proposal can still be a surprise, you'll either pick out the ring later together or you'll be surprised with the ring you both picked out."
"Yes! I was 23 and my bf was 28 and I was his first girlfriend. He’s a pretty introverted guy and according to him, it’s not easy for him to open up to people and fall in love. He’s the most gentle, caring, funny, and kind person ever! I feel so lucky that he chose me :)"
"Yeah, my ex cheated on me four years into our relationship. It shocked me in a way that nothing else really has because it felt so out of the blue and came during a high point in the relationship. We dated for another 2 1/2 years and my main regret with him is just not ending it then. He was great for six months after it, then began to transform into this mean, angry shell of his former self. I will never, ever stay with a cheater again. It’s not worth it and at times made me question my own self love."

"Haha yes, my husband is a big guy, with a long beard and wild look, but he's a cotton candy on the inside. 

Once, in a family party we found a not so close cousin who has always been a drug, alcoholic douche who is always looking for conflict. We always try to just ignore him and stay as far as possible from him, but this time he approached my hubby while he was going out from the bathroom and tried to start a fight. I was watching from our table like if I knew something was threatening My husband, because he doesn't even speak our language so he was very confused at this ugly, violent, drunk guy trying to fight him, so there I was running towards him, with my super short body, and I don't know where I got my strength from, but I pushed him so hard he fell and I stepped in front of my husband and started yelling him to go away. This guy is known for even hitting women, he doesn't cares, but people who saw it says that even he looked surprised and kind of scared.

I've always been a calmed, kind and even an childish person, but this guy had awaken my inner monster hahaha, I pushed him off the party and was barking like a demon Chihuahua. 

We still see him from time to time, unfortunately he always gets in family reunions, but now he openly avoids us, specially me. That's great for all, cause God knows I would kill whoever tries to harm my puffy puff 🤣🤣🤣"
Bouncer comes around to check every couple months to make sure he is still partnered with her
"Honestly, the ""we're a family"" line. It basically just means that you're not actually part of the ""family"" and they'll openly side with employees that have longer histories at the company. This happened at my last job. My immediate supervisor was constantly having complaints filed against her but her supervisor dismissed all of them because she's ""family"" to him.

Getting offered a job before they even ask questions is another big one. I rarely accept jobs where they don't ask about my experience, why I'm good for the position, or why I want the job. I've learned quite a few times in the past that they shouldn't be so eager to hand jobs over. If the interviewer simply tells you about the position, asks about your schedule, and then offers the job, chances are it's a really shitty job. 

Badmouthing former employees is another sign of toxicity. I've generally experienced that it means they can't accept blame for anything. They would rather scapegoat all their problems onto past employees rather than attempt to change things."
*Cries in United States*
"I know my ex-husband and ex-best friend tell people they became romantically involved while supporting each other through their divorces/after separating from their spouses.

Truth: they had an affair and left us both to be together. I know they've lied about it to her family and to some of our former friends. Fucking cowards."
I am really self-conscious about my boobs. I was having sex with this guy and he stopped halfway through and looked at me and said “I really love your boobs”. It was so corny and I was so high on dopamine that it felt like the nicest thing anyone had ever said to me 🤷🏼‍♀️
Husband here. One of my most cherished duties as a husband is when I sit down with my wife and regulate her hormones. /s
"In interviews I like to ask what the best attributes are for success in the position.  If they say ""flexibility"" it means they don't respect there employees enough, and expect them to roll with it."
"Absolutely. I've interjected in many ""bullying"" situations and helped de-escalate by spouting off random shit."
"In my opinion, when you're truly in love with someone you want whatever's best for them and makes them happy, even if it's not you."

"Lost half my body weight (125lbs) with a change in diet and working out. It cost almost 3 years but was totally worth it.

This year I finally had my abdominoplastic to get rid of my belly's excess skin. Had to pay it completely myself (8.000€) since my insurance wouldn't cover it (which is unusual in Germany, our health insurance covers a lot) and had to take 2 weeks of paid leave for the surgery and getting well. (And I worked one additional week from home, worked that one out with my boss.) Totally worth every penny and the fact I have only 4 weeks of paid leave left this year."
Yesterday my doctor told me I should find a husband in order to regulate my hormones
I’d say check the company reviews. You can learn a lot about how they do business and what your work environment may be like from that.
I feel like this is the wrong time to acknowledge your name but uh hello shark. Been up to anything recently?
"The default answer here is therapy, but there is a lot more you can do. 

Some things I recommend: 

* Reading--do research. Read books about abusers and their tactics. Read books about personality disorders. Read books about other people who have been mentally abused. This is helpful to broaden your knowledge about abuse so that you can recognize it more easily in the future, but also so that you can see that your experience wasn't a one-off. 
* Tell your friends and family about it. A big part of abuse is isolating you to various extents. The longer you're out of an abusive situation and are around people who aren't abusers, the more you're going to realize how screwed up some of the stuff that happened to you was. You may not realize a certain thing was abuse until one of your friends or family members tells you how it is. 
* Cut off the abuser entirely, if possible. If it's a guy you have a kid with, it's pretty much impossible to cut him off entirely unless he's lost parental rights, but for everyone else, cut them out of your life. Block their email, their phone number, and social media. Throw away pictures of them. Throw or give away things that remind you of them. If you were married to them, sell that ring. 
* It's ok if you end up needing an anti-anxiety medication or an antidepressant. Don't be ashamed about it. 
* Super important here--some mental abuse is so bad that you actually develop PTSD. While our knee-jerk reaction to situations like this is to talk about and to go to therapy and talk about it some more, PTSD works a bit differently. Each time you put yourself in a situation to recall something you experienced, you're just hurting yourself because you're experiencing the whole scenario over again in your head. It's kind of like continuing to pick a scab instead of letting it heal. If you suspect this is the case, you'll need to find a therapist who knows how to deal with trauma. You may need to go through multiple therapists. You may need to develop coping strategies when you encounter something that makes you remember something your abuser did to you. Telling everyone about your abuse may not be the best thing with PTSD. 
* Get some new hobbies. Chances are, your abuser probably wouldn't let you have certain hobbies or made fun of the hobbies you had so much that you didn't do them. Do something that is yours. 
* Abusers turn you into what they want you to be, or they try really hard to. You're not the same person you were before you were abused. Recovering from abuse is your chance to make yourself into a new person. What's something you've always wanted to do? Do it. Try out things just for the heck of it.  Arrange your living space how you want it. Paint the walls whatever color you want them. Buy some new outfits. Get your hair done. Get a new job. Develop an exercise routine. Whereas your abuser probably restricted parts of the world from you, you now have access to the whole thing. 
* It's not you; it's not your fault; you have to realize this. Repeat it to yourself if you have to. Abusers are, at the very least, jerks, and at the most, people with psychological issues like borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, psychopathy, or even the product of abuse themselves. You couldn't have changed any of that. They weren't abusing you because you were bad; they were abusing you because they were bad or broken. 
* Learn how to protect yourself as much as possible, both in a mental sense and perhaps even a physical sense. Remember how I mentioned psychopathy? Not every psychopath is a serial killer. They're everywhere. They prey on people because of the vulnerabilities they see in you. You need to ask yourself what you think it might have been. Some people are really compassionate and they're taken advantage of. If that's you, you're going to have to learn how to develop a bit of a thick skin when you hear sob stories. You're going to have to make yourself have at least a little doubt when you hear a sad story, which is an unfortunate situation to have to put yourself in because some of us just want to believe the whole world is good. Psychopaths are very good at telling sad stories to get you on their side. You have to program yourself to be cautious. You need to learn to notice red flags. A guy says ""I love you,"" really quickly, he offers you money for whatever when you barely know him, his exes are crazy, he's the victim in everything--all red flags. 
* Be as independent as you can. It helps you feel like you have some control over your life and to actually have some control. Never, ever, combine all your money with a SO again, if you did with your abuser. 
* Find a birth control method that works for you and can't be easily tampered with. One way abusers may try to get you under their thumb is by getting you pregnant. They might screw with your BC pills or poke holes in your condoms, or take a condom off during sex. An abuser may not show their abuse until they have some sort of control over you, like you're pregnant, for example. Having a child with an abuser will probably stick you with them a lot longer than you want to be with them. In addition to this, know how and where to get an abortion, if need be. 

Even with therapy, and doing the things I've mentioned, there are still going to be times you remember something awful they did to you. It's going to happen, but it's going to happen less and less over time. It may make you angry, but that's ok. You have a right to be angry about it. You don't have to forgive them for it either. There are going to be people who tell you that you have to forgive everyone for anything, but you don't have to forgive someone who tried to grind you to the dirt. You can just say, ""That happened. I'm never letting this person near me again."" 

You may want to make your abuser suffer, but with mental abuse, there's not a lot you can do. The legal system doesn't give a crap. It's not even a valid reason to get divorced in most places. You can't buy billboards and say how bad of a person they are. It's also not kosher to reach out to someone you know they're dating and tell them everything. That abuser is going to turn the whole situation around on you and make you sound crazy. Whatever person is dating them is probably already too caught up in the abuser's enticement to even listen to reason. If they reach out to you and ask, you can lay it all out like a buffet. That person has to choose whether or not to believe you. You probably can't save other people from your abuser, which sucks. It sucks to feel powerless. You're out and that's the most important thing."
"It's important to know if you have fibrous breasts, though, as it might make it harder to detect breast cancer."
"We tell everyone we met at an airport, which we technically did, but we originally met on Facebook and were friends for about six months prior with a few flirts here and there. The part we leave out is me giving him a blowjob in the middle of nowhere after I picked him up from the airport, and a farmer chasing us away from the property. ( we were on public county road, but parked near a private pasture gate). Good times. Still together almost a decade later, but we're older, more tired, and less spontaneous in public unless we decide to stop by the taco shop on the way home without planning to first."
"I graduated this year and have been in a bit of a slump, as I haven't found a job yet. I have let myself go. I'm now working on picking myself up again: Losing the weight that I gained due to boredom/emotional eating, exercising or just moving my body a bit more after laying in bed most of the time, and slowly fixing my sleep schedule to get up at a reasonable hour. 
Mentally, I'm building up my sense of self worth by reminding myself of all the things I've accomplished and all the strengths and skills I have, and all the things I've overcome successfully."
"A huge red flag was when I interviewed for a company who told me that 100 hour work weeks were a rarity not the norm, maybe a few times a year. They said it like they were so proud of it. Uh excuse me, I think a 100 hour work week should be completely out of the question!"
My best friend calls me legasaurus which is hilarious and flattering
"Also on this note, if people have either been there 10+ years or 1 year but nothing in between. It suggests a 'boys club' in upper management and a high turnover rate at the bottom. Huge red flag."
"Not a doctor, but I was once told by someone at a plasma donation center that my plasma was a very pretty color, and it stands to this day at the weirdest compliment I've ever received. Like... thanks?? I made it myself."
"The dress thing is so accurate, every time I’m running super late and can’t decide what to wear I toss on a dress. People think I’m trying to look nicer than usual, just cause of the connotation of a dress, but really it’s the opposite lol"
Sorry doesn’t begin to cover it. Fuck.
"Being treated like you're just an incubator and your feelings don't matter. 

Currently 5 months pregnant and I have placenta previa, which means the placenta is sitting on my cervix. Increased risk of bleeding means I'm on pelvic rest, doctor said no running, no core workouts and NO SEX, possibly until the end of my pregnancy. I was understandably upset, but everyone I talked to had the same response, ""think of the baby"". I am. That's why I'm following my doctor's orders, but I'm still a person with feelings and this still sucks a lot for me. I just wanted to be able to vent without someone rationalizing my discomfort/feelings by saying ""oh the baby the baby"".

It can feel dehumanizing and it's happened with a couple different issues over my pregnancy."
Stagehands are fucking AGGRESSIVE about vocabulary. It’s not a light it’s an instrument. It’s not a bulb it’s a lamp. wires and cables are very different things.
"I tell my husband he has to sleep closer to the door for this reason but I think it’s really that I like being near the window, which is also a stab risk.

I do like having my back to the wall in restaurants too. Maybe I’m secretly an organized crime don and unaware or something."
"I told my mum that I met my boyfriend at a lecture but I really met him in a club. She wouldn't have cared anyway but it was at a time when I kept meeting people in clubs and bars, telling her about it, and then it would never go anywhere."
"""That's normal, you're overreacting""

No, it isn't normal to bleed during a pelvic exam, thanks.

Also, a radiologist looked at me and said ""I love your skin, you have great skin"" and then called out to another radiologist and said ""See, this is the kind of skin that I want"". Didn't know how to respond to that one."
"My first exam at a new gyno at 18: “Oh! You’re ____’s daughter!” 

Yeah that’s who I got referred by.. glad we look the same down there I guess??"
"I’m definitely insecure about my body because it seems like I’m the only one in my circle that is slightly overweight. I have a small frame and hourglass shape but my hips and butt dramatically flare out. My friends all seem normal/average to me. We were on a girls trip recently and dancing at a club when we ended up next to this group of absolutely stunning younger women - probably in their 20s. I caught a quick glimpse of one of them and thought to myself - wow that girl is beautiful! And then kept dancing.

A couple seconds later two of them approached me and the gorgeous one put her arm around my waist and said “You have an amazing body!” - I thanked her and our groups danced together for about 30 seconds and then they wandered off. There was nothing shady or weird or even sexual about the way she said it. It was totally girl power and appreciation and really just so, so nice. Especially coming from someone so conventionally beautiful! I definitely had a strut to my walk for the rest of the night and didn’t mind swishing those hips around. 😊😊"
"I have had two dentists tell me that I have a very small mouth and that I have LOTS of saliva, much more than the average person (one said they were surprised I didn't drown in my sleep and the other said if saliva was a commodity I would be rich!). I feel weird every time it's mentioned! Anyone else ever get weird comments from medical professionals?"
"Not me but my brother and his GF met on Tinder. She didn’t want her family to know she was on that app so they think they were set up by mutual friends. Which, luckily they have mutual friends despite a 4 year age gap and growing up 2 hours apart. 

I met my BF on Bumble and I don’t care who knows. Most people in my circle that are in relationships met online."
"This is perhaps not answering the question in exactly the way you were thinking, but a problem that women can face in pregnancy is that it can be a key risk factor in the beginning of or escalation of domestic violence.

Instead of it being a time when women are most cherished by their partners, it is a time when, statistically, a woman can be most at risk of violence from their partner."
"My office has security cameras ALL OVER for ""security reasons"" but really so the owner of the company can watch us to see if we are working."
"I'm not conventionally beautiful, and at the age of 35 I just decided that rather than forcing my appearance into something its not, I would just work on who I am ""on the inside"". I work in a doctors office and the compliments that make me have a spring in my step for the rest of the day is the ones that the patients give me about how welcome I make them feel, how happy I seem, and that they  appreciate the laughs we have. I know it sounds corny, but it has helped me  tremendously with the sometimes  debilitating insecurity I have carried with me for years about how I look.

My toxic trait is that I’m manipulative without even realizing that I do it. It’s a hard pill to swallow when realizing how much of my dad has been instilled in me on a subconscious level.  I’ve fought so hard for so long not to be manipulated that it never once occurred to me that I would become the manipulator.
It’s something that I have to be very mindful of because it is very toxic."

"He dumped me and I found myself alone in a foreign country. My nearest family was hours away, and my entire friend circle was through him. I was completely on my own, no family, no friends, nowhere to live."
"World of Warcraft.... yup, an online video game. Ten years ago I became friends with a couple in the same guild. They knew my boyfriend and I had just broke up so they convinced me to start talking to their friend. We ended up playing the game together and hitting it off. We exchanged numbers and texted daily for 2 months until he convinced me to come visit all of them. They lived 800 miles from me. 

We’ve been together 9 years, married 2 and have one son. 

My parents are almost 70, conservative and traditional. They believe we met in college through a friend who happened to be from that state... it’s never been mentioned so we haven’t corrected it."
Answering on behalf of my other half here--she saves me from my own stupidity on a weekly basis.
"A random man approached me on the street to tell me that he thought I looked like a powerful woman. He said he could see a lot of strength and called me a lioness. He didn't even say anything about my appearance, but it's by far the best compliment I have ever received."
Tinder. My first message said I wanted to fuck him so I try not to talk bout how we really met lmao
"Food aversions. Everyone talks about food cravings like it’s a cute joke, but food aversions are more common. Imagine food suddenly smelling like trash or vomit, coupled with a very sensitive sense of smell so you can smell other people’s food a mile off. I couldn’t stand the smell of cooking oil, made the sickness so much worse."
Haha yeah I’ve always been bi but the username refers to a dream I had where I fell in love with a beautiful woman made of marzipan and declared myself a marzipan lesbian lol
"IME this is better than, ""oh yeah, I know exactly what this is,"" before any tests are performed. I prefer doctors smart enough to know they don't know shit."
"Not from a doctor but a few years ago my BFF dragged me to her aesthetician for a facial. While examining my face with her magnifier and atomic-powered alternate light source and whatever, the lady said to me, ""Huh, your skin's not as bad as it looks.""

Um, thanks?"
I was told by my nurse that she could see signs of ‘wear and tear’ and then she burst out giggling. I’d just got into a new relationship so she probably had a point.
*unroll tide*
"Following a patellar tendinopathy diagnosis: ""You know, really, it's about time you grow up and stop playing sport."" I was 33 at the time, and he made me feel like I had lost my youth, identity and happiness in one sentence.

I left his office, cried a lot, gathered myself, and got a new doctor. I did knee rehab for 2 straight years with his guidance and encouragement, recovered, and still play sport. I'm 37 now and hope to play for decades to come."
"I met him in the army. I was Missouri national guard and he was stationed in Texas so we had a long distance relationship after I came off active duty. I went down to visit him before his deployment and accidentally found the ring when he asked me to grab something from his bag (I was going through the wrong bag but didn’t know it). I panicked because I was only 20 and it felt like a knee jerk reaction to his deployment. We’d been dating for nine months and I just wasn’t ready and didn’t want to be one of those army couples that got hitched way too quickly because of the benefits of being married in the military. So I told him I found the ring and told him “not yet”. I loved him and could see us having a life together but wanted to make sure that wasn’t just the honeymoon phase. A year and half later, while on my deployment I told him I’d marry him. He proposed when I got home and were now in the process of buying a house together. The wedding is waiting till we’re both done with college since we prioritized the house (aka gaining equity instead of losing money on rent). Just waiting till we’re more financially stable (so out of college and have jobs) so we don’t start our marriage off with money struggles."
My standard is “thanks I grew it myself” if you’re ever in need again
"dog training:

"We were together for about 14 years, high school sweethearts. We were engaged and he decided he didn’t want to get married so we ended it. He tried to fix things between us about a year after it happened and told me everything I wanted to hear. 

He was doing all this while he already had another girlfriend. 

I’ve never had anxiety until then."
"Some people are. 

Some people are temporarily. 

Some people are codependent, and need the time alone in order to become a healthier version of who they are. 

I'm better off single, personally, but it's because I'm just not the type of person who makes for a good girlfriend. 

I start off being super infatuated with the newness of someone different in my life, and then reality kicks in and I start to panic and distance myself as I realize that at the end of the day, I much prefer being single, and guys deserve better than someone who has an expiration date in mind. And I start overthinking and wondering if we aren't both settling because it's a vast, vast world. And my life isn't changed exponentially by the addition or removal of a relationship, so I might as well stay in my comfort zone.

Relationships are good for people who are open and willing to be flexible in the contexts of what a successful relationship needs."
"Thats disgusting, I'm so sorry he has to deal with that :/"
"I was 15 at my first ever gyn appointment and the only thing she said during the exam was, ""I see someone's sexual active"". The silence that filled the room for the remainder of the check up was deafening."
"Just read about your nonprofit. I think what you’re doing is amazing. I think the understanding you carry for the person who took her from you is humbling. You have given her memory the most beautiful thing by attempting to help those who use violence instead of words in conflicts.  I don’t know that kind of grace, but yours is inspiring."
"Sure am. I am his first, he’s 38, I’m 46. 

It’s actually sweet, because he doesn’t have that jaded “all women are bitches” attitude most men have by this time &amp; he avoided becoming an incel."
Yaaaa I once had a gyno mid exam say I had a cute cervix and didn’t know how to respond.
"Not about me, but my first child:

&amp;#x200B;

At hospital's emergency room.  My first child had issues with asthma and would need to go to emergency a few times a year for breathing issues.  We'd go, they'd put him on Ventolin, and that would fix him up.  This one time, the doctor walks in, my son is barely breathing.  He takes a quick look and says ""do you ever think his head is too big for the rest of his body?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  ""uuuuuhhhhh..... he's not breathing""

&amp;#x200B;

FYI, at 28 he still has a big head, but at least he's 6'1"" so he kind of grew into it.  He has a hard time buying hats though."
I can be very jealous in a relationship. I'm not jealous with friends or family etc just when I'm in a relationship with someone I love. I have been single for a long while now and i don't know if it has improved as I haven't been in a situation where it comes to the surface but I'm not happy within myself so that could mean I'm not ready to be in love. While I have been single I have matured massively and I know my flaws and until I happy within myself and worked on myself I will stay single.
"I was the first woman my ex-husband ever even held hands with. His first date, first kiss, first everything. I was 18 when I started dating him. He was about to turn 22. His anxiety has kept him from dating. We had been friends before we started dating. I obviously went out with him after he went psycho niceguy when i dared to go on a date with someone else and our entire social circle ostracized me for ""not giving him a chance"". After our first date, there was intense peer pressure to stay together and i was too socially awkward to know how to get out. 

He was sexually, verbally, physically, and financially abusive. After some time, I just felt I didn't deserve to be treated well and believed i deserved his treatment of me.

I divorced him after 11 total years together when he cussed out our son for touching a trash can. A few days later he got violent with me for the last time. Our son wasn't even two years old, but he saved me. I realized I couldn't let him be treated like I was treated and I didn't want him growing up with my shitbag ex as his primary male role model."
"Yes. He was 22, never had a girlfriend, never been kissed, obviously nothing else. He had 14-year-old-esque assumptions about women that had slept with other men and regularly accused me of cheating. We're obviously not together anymore."
"We met on Tinder and are open about it. It’s kinda awkward with older people, but people in our generation understand that real relationships can come from dating apps."
"If you constantly “fall in love” with different people as soon the current one is slowly “falling out of love”, then you are after the “in love” feeling. Wanting to have those butterflies all the time and the feeling of the anticipation of seeing the other or their touch or anything. 

Unfortunally I knew a few good people who got “addicted”/lured into this, chasing it everywhere. Truely believing as soon the first emotions settled that the love was not true or good or right. They had to move on and usually it did not took long for them to find the next “one and only” . Personally I believe that you know it yourself. But as said, all those butterflies and endorfines do give a nice “high”feeling. It is easy wanting to keep it. Look at Hollywood or such, the butterflyfeeling is always there and set as norm. Some people take it as truth."
LASIK. Holy crap I would have paid 3x what it actually cost me for this eyesight.
"You see someone kick someone and drag them into the house and not call 911? Wtf.

Also wtf can you sue the police?? Aren't phone calls recorded?"
My doctor was doing a pill check up and told me that I looked ‘nicely oestrogenised’. Apparently he meant that my hair and skin looked healthy.
"Out of all of these, this is the first one to make me laugh loudly. Love your response!"
I think it's ALWAYS better to be single than in a bad relationship.

"THIS!!! I came here to say exactly this. In my experience, every single company  I worked with that plastered “We work hard and Play harder” all over the place were actually saying “We want you to work hard, long hours, sometimes on weekends as well, and instead of providing you with benefits, maternity leave, or retirement options, we’ll pay for a snack cart once a week and provide a foosball table in the break room that you likely won’t ever use... also, don’t forget about our bean bag chairs!”.

Cool, thanks for the monthly happy hour, but I’d prefer that money go towards my retirement."
"""We're looking for rockstars"" is code for, ""we will overwork and underpay you."" Basically if the word rockstar is mentioned in any capacity, it's probably a trash job."

"I went to get birth control as a teenager once and the doctor berated me for not having a more womanly figure yet (I'm exactly like my mum, we're slim and we kinda just go straight down). After talking to the other girls at school, it transpired that I wasn't the only one he'd made weird comments to. I wish I'd have made a complaint at the time, but he was a whole two minutes from retirement so hopefully he didn't have the opportunity to make many more weird comments..."
"I sleep across the *entire* bed when I’m home alone, haha."
"When I caught my then fiancé cheating on me with random men he picked up from an ad he posted on Craigslist. 
I worked full time and went to school until 9pm M-F. He was hosting men and having sex with them in our bed. I had a gut feeling something was up, and checked his email (he forgot we had given eachother our passwords). The emails were graphic to say the least. 
He tried to deny he ever actually met up with anyone. But the emails told another story."
"Ashford Castle in Ireland.

I mean, it’s a literal castle. What’s not to like? 

It had the most beautiful pool and spa area. The tea service was excellent. I felt like I was a lady in Downton Abbey. I took a falconry lesson on the grounds. Overall amazing experience. It was like living out my girlhood fantasy."
When he heard I was a lesbian. ‘So you’re a virgin?’
"Yes, and I felt terribly gently explaining to my son that he wasn't allowed to marry me, even though he ""loves me the most of ANYONE"".

AAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
"When my boyfriend and I were moving into our first house I was the one to pick up the Uhaul. Only problem was that I couldn't find the parking break release so I asked this nice Uhaul guy Kyle to help me out and he did. After, as he's sliding out of the uhaul, he says kind of meekly ""I'm not supposed to do this but you gotta man?"" 
And normally I'm that girl who gets loud and shuts down cat calling or unwamted attention and sets it straight but he wasn't trying to be creepy(that I could tell, he was really polite the whole time he helped me) so I said ""yeah, actually I do."" And he starts shaking his head yes and says something that I think about a lot. 
""Well you tell your man that he is very lucky. You are very beautiful and God doesn't need to bless him with anymore because God already gave him you."" And at the time I was so flattered and taken off guard that I just sorta got all red and told him thank you and to have a really good day and went on to move. 
But I still think about it a lot because it just made me feel really good about my whole self. I am a bigger girl and I grew up getting fat shamed a lot and so I almost always get ready for men to belittle me for my size or think they can ""throw me a bone"" and get a quickie out of it but I am generally pretty confident so I brush it off. But Kyle at Uhaul, thank you for reminding me that I am very beautiful and that not all men will make you feel like crap for using the ""I have a boyfriend"" line even when it's true."
"1. I find a day once or twice and month and do a little spa day for myself. I’ll dye my brows and lashes (never have to put makeup on those then), wax my legs/bikini line (don’t have to shave as much), deep condition and trim the ends of my hair, exfoliate and use a face mask, and of course pedicure and paint my nails. 

It takes a few hours but it saves time in the end. I actually really enjoy this time and drink some wine while I do it :) 

2. As far as clothes and style, I try to only buy pieces that fit well and that I really truly love. I’m slowly getting rid of anything I don’t absolutely love or that doesn’t really flatter my body. Also I’ve been investing in high quality causal, comfy wear- buying lounge wear,  pajamas, and gym clothes with just as much thought and style as regular clothing. Most everything I own now matches my style and is flattering so I don’t really have to think much about it."
"Is face primer/eye primer useless?

Some of us use concealer, some use a dedicated product."
"Besides the obvious horrible things like cheating, abuse etc. I'd say not doing your part of the chores. I can not emphasize enough how big of a turn off it is to pick up a mans dirty underwear from the floor next to the hamper to put it in the hamper, while he sits on his ass playing video games."
"I'm pretty sure its not legal, but I was once asked if I planned to start a family in the next 5 years and if so, did I have someone that would be responsible for the child should I not be able to make scheduled pick-ups/appointments. This was at a corporate m-f/8-5 company and I was assured that overtime generally isn't allowed. I don't know if its worth mentioning that all three interviewers were men 30+."
"His apartment bed room had a sliding glass door and the way the sun hit the bed in the morning bugged me so he was nice enough to take the ""bad"" spot and it's been like that ever since."
"My brother has a black father. Our mom and my father are white. I am 100% white boy, and he looks as black as any black man. You can tell we're brothers once you get past the skin color. Anyways, there have always been lots of time when we were growing up when he would be treated unfairly or be bullied due to his skin. It would usually stop when I stepped in. So, yeah I know what that's like. When you have both black and white people in your family, the differences in how they're treated really stands out."
"I recently went for an interview where I asked if I could get a look at the schedule before accepting the job offer. No no, I had to accept the job offer first and then I would learn all the details about the job. So I did. I saw the schedule and the workload. I realised that it was unreasonable and I wasnt willing to do it. I quit the next day. I think this kind of strong arming behaviour is a huge red flag. It's been rather rare but Ive always become extremely wary when the interviewer gets a little pushy."
I was asked the difference between abortion and adoption.
I don’t think we ever made a conscious decision...I think I just got on one side the first time we slept together and he got on the other and never changed.

"My significant other and I switch back and forth between one partner doing more for the other depending on what is going on in each of our lives. For a long while I was feeling depressed, burnt out and frustrated about work, and a constant exhaustion that wouldn’t shake. He happily showered me with love, affection, meals, cleaning, etc. 

Now, I am feeling very content with life, mental health, and work, while he is feeling very stressed with work. I’m doing more of the heavy lifting emotionally and taking care of meals and cleaning. 

We make a good team and are looking forward to both of us feeling more content with life and our jobs to evenly balance out our love and actions."
I used to be a really good listener but as a result I was too quiet until halfway through high school. Now about 8 years later I’m an interrupter so I really need to strike a balance here.
"I’m low maintenance to the point where I can’t relate to the desire of seeing my SO every day. I’ve known this since pretty much I was 9 years old, I prefer to do things on my own, and while I like dating I hate being forced to spend all free time with someone. Even texting can be exhausting for me. I’ve tried improving it but hasn’t worked"
"i was explaining to an ex that not all women orgasm through penetrative-only sex. he absolutely did not believe me, and asked me ""do you even understand how sex works?"""

"I have PTSD so when I get my annual gynecologist exam I always have a VERY hard time. I usually bring someone in with me so I can be distracted and hold their hand. One time I had a man gynecologist which I was really nervous about. He could tell how nervous I was so he was being super nice and was cracking jokes. Once I finally relaxed he said ""Girl, I know you've been putting penises up here, you can handle a little finger!"" I just laughed so much and anytime I get my exam I always think of that!"

"Realistically, of the few times I've had a man step in to ""protect"" me, it was from another violent man. In those situations, being a drastically smaller and less intimidating force does not make it easy to be The One Who Jumps In When Screaming Ragey Men Are Screaming Rage-ily. When I protect the men closest to me, its often from having their feelings hurt, not from any physical threat. I'll tell my SO when there's gum on the ground so he doesn't step on it, as a silly example, and hold him close when his emotions/anxiety are getting the best of him, on a serious note. 

In high school I was pretty opinionated, so I would stand up for my friends when there was teasing involved. Those situations are decades past, however, so not really applicable to my current life."
"Yup.

I would also ssmay it kicked in for mr when I was like ""Holy shit. This person could leave me anytime and my life will suuuck without them. I need to be the best version of myself so they stay."""
"Had a tiny wedding. It was just us and our immediate families on a beach in Mexico. Intimate and stress-free. 

We also had a bbq back home for friends and family. Because it was just a big backyard bbq, it was a lot more casual and lower pressure. Although I did have to go hide out in the basement a couple of times just to recharge."
"Did I write this? Lol. 

Plus I'm clingy. But I also like my space. So only I'm allowed to be clingy."
"We're not lying in general, just to his parents. We met at Pride and they don't know yet he's bi and wouldn't be fine with it."
"I got laser hair removal and it barely worked at all.  After 13 sessions, I still shave my face once a week. Any laser tech that says their machine works on light hair against light skin is scamming you. If you have dark hair against light skin, laser is great, though.

Can't speak for electrolysis as I haven't tried it yet"
"I recently took a modern dance class after not dancing at all for over 4 years (had been dancing for like 6 years prior and spent time studying modern dance at university before switching majors). I was really nervous, it had been a long time and I had put on a lot of weight and was generally feeling pretty self conscious about dancing again.
There was a moment where I was at the front of the class, going through one of the phrases and the teacher yelled out ""yes! yes beautiful!"" at me and had me demonstrate the move again for everyone else. I felt like crying, it felt so good to have that validation that I wasn't just a fat lump who couldn't move like that anymore."

"John Mulaney has a bit in ""New In Town"" about how his girlfriend does that for him. It's hilarious.

"Just the other day I came across a job posting in my field, through a small FB group for my industry. The position sounded great for me, exactly like something that would be a good step forward, they even listed the salary range and it's where I want to be.

Went to Glassdoor and while there aren't a lot of reviews, they're all pretty bad. Mostly about toxic management, ridiculous deadlines, and too much gossip and backstabbing. 

Damn it."
"Moved from the US to Germany. Married almost 6 years, have a beautiful 2 year old, and I job I like (some days love). Better water and food standards, more affordable healthcare, better work/life balance, etc.

It’s not all roses. I do miss my family immensely and I’m always a little bit of a fish out of water. I’ll probably never totally fit in since I was born and raised in a different culture/language."

"I got asked how unusual it was for labor to last more than 15 minutes. 

😂😂😂😂 boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...."
My old OBGYN told me during a Pap smear that I had a “teeny tiny vaginey.”
"My time is my own. I can be impulsive about my plans because they don't affect my partner. Maybe I thought I was going to wake up earlier on a Saturday to do something but I'll decide at the last minute to sleep in - I don't have to update anyone or feel guilty about it. I also have a ton of time for my hobbies or to spend time with family and friends.

Similarly, all my money and emotional labor are all my own too. I don't have the bandwidth right now to manage a relationship with a partner at the moment but I've been able to take better care of myself now that I'm single. I don't have the stresses of maintaining a relationship like some of my friends do. They'll complain about their partners- for the most part, everyone is happy but you know, people can still drive each other crazy. Or maybe someone just had a rough breakup - that's not something I have to deal with in my life. No cheating, break-ups or other distress.

I can make a big life/financial decision and not have to check in with my partner about it. If I want to move across the country or sell the house, I can. I don't have to worry that my partner just started his new job so there's no way we can leave the area anytime soon. I can get a dog or cat or multiple pets if I feel like it without having to convince my partner - or maybe they want a noisy bird but I don't.

Not having to share a bed or bathroom. I'm a light sleeper so having someone else snoring or moving around in the bed really throws me off. I can hog all the counter space if I want to and the bathroom doesn't get as dirty so quickly if there's just 1 person using it. 

Meals for 1: no one's going to complain if I want to eat the same thing for dinner 3 nights in a row or just have something simple because I didn't feel like putting more effort into cooking that day.

Whose side of the family do we visit for the holidays? Nope, just my side!"
My boyfriend basically does everything and without complaint. I always try to do more but he is basically willing and happy to do it himself and tells me to relax. I've always been pretty messy but thought I was doing a better job of keeping things tidy lately. Turns out my boyfriend has acknowledged I'm a messy person and feels he cleans up after me but he also seriously told me that he's happy to do it and doesn't mind. Am I lucky or am I just living in some kind of fantasy?
"Yes! I also feel like a good test is thinking “if sex and romance were completely off the table, would I still want to be this person’s best friend?” You can’t have love without liking and wanting to be around someone first."

"My uterus is turned and tilted in an odd way. It doesn’t affect my fertility, as the baby grows it puts itself in the correct position because there’s only so much room for it to move to. 

The first time a doctor noticed they said, “I’ve never seen this before. That’s creepy, I like it.”"
"There isn’t a way for me to “protect” him from this per se, but my husband has had 3 brain surgeries for tumors and I was by his side and took care of him each time."
"When I visited with a surgeon to have a mole removed on my lower back he said, ""You must be a gym rat, let's have a look at your buttocks to make sure you don't have any other moles..."" I am sort of a gym rat, but I didn't know what else to do other than open the paper robe I was wearing further to let him look at my butt cheeks. I wound up going to a different surgeon due to him being out of network for insurance, but I'm still a little creeped out by that interaction."
I *love* the LINE Hotel in DC. My husband and I stayed there for our anniversary. It's in an old restored church and the rooms are very unique - plus it had a claw foot tub. The customer service was also wonderful. It's definitely one of the more unique hotels I've ever stayed in.
A nurse told my mom recently she said a 'perfect little uterus.' How do you even respond to comments like that?
"I see things very “Black and White” and tend to hold people I care about to a very high standard.  This leads to me being disappointed in their behavior because I truly believe in my heart that they can be better or make better choices. 

I am working on it quite a bit, realizing that while certain things may be very easy for me. I am 4 years sober just decided one day I was tired of being the mean blackout drunk and I quit drinking. It was hard but it was important to me, to change my behavior before I hurt anymore people I love. 

I realize now some people may have a harder time with addictions than I did. It’s not just a “switch” they can turn off if they care enough."
"My brother, who suffered some of the things I did at the hands of our parents and often intervened when he thought I would die from it.

Young me managed to call the police by signalling a neighbour through the window. Bless that woman, she took me seriously.
When they arrived and questioned us, my parents swore high and low that it was all self inflicted and I was delirious.

I looked to my brother.

I stared him down and drowned in a new sense of helplessness when he told those cops I made it all up. That was the last time I asked anyone to save me.

To this day he can't look me in the eye for more than five consecutive seconds without crying. I haven't been able to forgive him."
I once owned a bloodhound dog....some jackass asked me if it freaked out when I had my period.
"Caught my then-husband in an affair with his ex. While we were trying to save the marriage in counseling, I then stumbled across the chat logs between him and the sex worker he’d been meeting in person for sex. 



I never, ever would have thought that he would cheat. After I caught him the first time, I was so shocked that I assumed that it had to be sone kind of horrible fluke, or that it was my fault (in part because that dbag told me it was my fault), so I gave him another chance instead of kicking his dumb ass to the curb. 



Lesson learned: if they’ve agreed to be in a monogamous relationship, but then decide to change the terms of that agreement without my knowledge or consent, that’s the end. No second chances, no reconciliation. When it comes to cheating, no one is entitled to my forgiveness."
"Great.. so on top of all my insecurities, now i need to worry that my cervix isnt cute enough for comment?"
Oooh yes. And yarn types. Acrylic vs Natural fibers in baby items is *intense* 😂
"Oh my God, I thought this was going to be a case of she walked in on him cheating but this is just horrific.

I cannot imagine how you must feel, I am deeply and truly sorry for your loss over that awful monster."
"""In all my years as a Doctor, I have never seen a bone so thoroughly broken.  ""  The X-ray of my collarbone looked like someone took an x-ray of a pile of toothpicks. I explained that I had been thrown from a Clydesdale.  ""You fell off a Clydesdale and that's all you broke??"" He was seriously incredulous.  I thought, isn't that enough?!"
"Honestly? The depression and anxiety. I had no history of that pre-pregnancy, but damn did it kick in once I was expecting. It got worse as I got further along. I spent the days leading up to birth crying. I literally woke up crying every morning while my husband held me.  And then I felt like shit for feeling that way, that I wasn’t excited for my son to be here (it was a very planned and very wanted pregnancy). I talked a lot about this during my pregnancy to people in my bump groups and it seems like it’s a relatively common thing. I had no idea about this beforehand, but it definitely helped knowing I wasn’t alone. 

My son is 8 months now and he is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Those feelings went away about 4 months post partum with the help of therapy."
"When I was developing, my boobs were pretty lopsided, and as a young girl I just felt ugly and defective. I decided to talk to my doctor about it and showed her, which was very hard for me. She told me that there was nothing I could do about it, and I would just have to not have any boyftiends or a husband. Because obviously a man would never love me if I didn't have perfect tits right? My self worth plummeted to less than zero that day, and my mom changed my doctor so I never had to see her again. Seriously fuck that lady."
"If you are going to wear it for the rest of your life, the person wearing it should like it.

Tell your SO what you like and show them some pictures if you don't want to physically go together. Or go try some on, find some you like and then let them go back and get something so it's still sort of a surprise."
Your question is quite specific. Is everything alright OP?
"My ex boyfriend was a virgin at 26 years old.  No one had ever seen him naked, touched his body (not even massage therapists), etc.  It was wonderful to be the first woman he fell in love with and also his first lover.  He made an effort to be romantic and a good boyfriend, as he hadn't been crushed yet by life's disappointments and women who didn't appreciate such things.  However, while that part was great, his lack of overall relationship experience took a toll.  He didn't do any favors by making me his first girlfriend, and he might not have felt it was all so new and sometimes uncomfortable to be in a relationship if I had been his 2nd or 3rd girlfriend.  I was about ten years older.  Years later, I still miss him - he's a great guy."
"Me too, and I'm very sensitive which adds to it. I can recall detailed memories from years ago, especially the emotional side of them so the bad feelings always feel fresh. Trying to be more compassionate towards my past self instead of beating myself up over those experiences"
"Who knows. They thought I had a bicornuate uterus at first, hence the ultrasounds. ""Everything's fine"". Meanwhile, my belly was like a damn torpedo off my right hip."
I have like 30 A-line swing dresses. People always comment on how well I dress. I'm just super lazy. Added bonus : A-line dresses are flattering and still fit great even if I gain or lose a little weight. Winning!
"During my first pap smear and pelvic exam, and actually every pelvic exam after that, my doctor exclaimed that I had the ""smallest"" vagina she's ever seen and that she'd try to be extra careful with me. While it was weird to hear, it certainly explained some things RE: sexual stuff-related pain lol"
"I think it’s something fine for consenting adults to engage in, but I don’t think it should be normalized. I think people have the right to profit off of objectifying themselves, but I also feel that the more objectification of women is normalized, the more it starts to infringe upon my right *not* to be. I don’t want to be seen primarily as a sex object and I don’t appreciate living in a society geared towards doing that as the default. I don’t like that we’re supposed to accept it as something natural for men to openly do.

So I’d rather it be treated like swingers clubs or fetish clubs. Like, do whatever you want with other consenting adults behind closed doors (and without shame), but don’t treat it like it should be the natural state of things and create societal pressure to engage in it."

"Once and it went really extremely horribly. I was 30 and he was 35. He had had a few short term girlfriends before and sex a handful of bumbling times. Unbeknownst to me he was so insanely desperate to get married and have kids he morphed into my absolute perfect man to ""land"" me I guess. We had the most amazingly perfect whirlwind courtship of 9 months and got engaged. Then I think he kind of stopped and realized, wow I'm pretending to be someone I'm not and realized he did not actually like or love me at all. (I've come to these conclusions after years of therapy, it was not clear at the time). We literally spent Christmas together at his parents, wearing matching footy PJs and having the best most amazing time with his family, saying how this time next year I might be pregnant - to him telling me 3 days later he did not love me, did not want to marry me, and was moving out that day. I never spoke to him again beyond arranging him picking up his stuff.

I'm sure this situation is really rare, but it was so painful and horrific. I actually went nuts for a while. Met my husband a couple of years later so all is well, but fuck man, this guy tricked me good. I don't even think he's evil, I do not believe he did it intentionally just got caught up in his pathetic desperation to get married. 

It did make me super skeptical of my now husband."
"Yeah, it was mainly just guys being completely clueless and unable to read dangerous situations. You don't need to be a genius to not engage with the obviously violent drunk people on the street, yet somehow my guy friends regularly feel the need to either visibly laugh at people like these or respond in a bad manner.

But obviously they champion themselves in ""saving me"", when the situation could have been avoided had they been more careful, plus I was the one most of the time ending things before it got serious..."
"Say out loud when something bothers me, giving more positive feedback to my SO, handling the rejections, defining my feminity while accepting and emphasizing it."

"&gt;my main regret with him is just not ending it then

This. I dated someone who cheated on me continuously, I knew not to give him a second chance but somehow I gave him many more than that and ended up marrying him. The cheating didn't stop. I thought I wasn't enough. And he never came clean, I always found out and had to confront him. I finally chose me and left, got divorced (with the added guilt trip from my parents that our family _just doesn't_ get divorced). 

When we were signing the papers, I asked him about this girl that kept texting him that the guys had met at his bachelor party. Back then, he had said that she met his brother and they really liked each other... But his brother's cell phone was always getting cut off because he was financially irresponsible so she would text my ex to reach his brother. Yeah, I knew it sounded fishy then, too, but he swore up and down that was the truth. So when we signed our divorce papers and I asked him, he finally admitted that they kissed. That conversation happened two years ago.

I started going to therapy a few weeks ago and last week we talked about all of his cheating and how it's affecting my current self-esteem. Afterward, I got curious and asked a friend's husband who was at his bachelor party if he knew if anything more happened. And he confirmed that not only did they sleep together, but my ex-husband stayed at her hotel the whole weekend and she and her friend hung out with the guys the entire time. That was one week before we got married."

"Had a date (40ish, not some young dude) say to me in a conversation ""I honestly thought that when women say 'no' they are just saying it, but they mean yes"". 

Frightening to think men still believe stuff like this."
"My SO at the time strangled me against a wall in a very busy public street. Streams of people were walking past us. The only response anyone had was one man complaining to his wife that we should do that sort of stuff in private. I was literally dangling in the air. No one helped. No one even paused a step.

I fully believe this person decided not to get involved."

"Yes! “We’re a family” is not only a red flag for severe lack of boundaries, but also code for “we are super fucking cliquey” and you are always the new kid, never really part of the “family” until you put years into it, but by then you’ve endured so much abuse."
"Sometimes when a patient is clearly miserable and the condition is TEMPORARY, I will indicate that something is gross. E.g., to person with horrible sore throat who can hardly swallow: ""Oh man, your tonsils look nasty. No wonder your throat hurts so much!""

Also I convinced most people in my life that year I was happy when I was suicidal through just pretending to be. I never ever thought I would be that kind of person but I’m getting out of that
Don't ever reveal that you're planning/trying to have a child. They just want to know if you're likely to go on maternity leave.

"My mom has given birth to 5 children in her life, and each time she’s pregnant she knows because she starts dropping everything she picks up. I’m 18 currently and I was having a “droopy-day” what I call days that I just can’t hold on to anything, and I made a comment about it and my mom took on a horrified glance and asked me if I was pregnant."
"This is the one I’ve been waiting for; it’s too bad I’m so late to the party.

In the old days of Twitter (this was like 2010-2012, old in internet years I guess) we both had anonymous accounts and were part of what I guess you could call a community of funny/dirty tweeters. There were lots of Twitter relationships back in the day, some moved into real life (and just for context, a LOT of affairs, marriages ended, etc.) 

We followed each other and had those relationships as we were both going through divorces. We knew if one another but didn’t really interact. Eventually this group started to move to Instagram. 

These were now private accounts but a lot less anonymous once we saw one another’s faces, and that’s when we started flirting but only a little and only in the comments.

Then one day on our semi-neglected twitter accounts, he added me to a list called “Pro-boner”. I took a screenshot, posted it to Instagram and said “I’m flattered”.

He responded “it’s latin, it means ‘for boners’” and I said I was, in fact, pro-boner. 

We tell people we met on eHarmony. He moved across the country, we are about to have our third anniversary of marriage, and right now our month old baby is asleep between us."

"Glassdoor is huge for me. I've worked for two large corporations and the glassdoor reviews were honestly spot on for the good, bad and ugly.   Just like on yelp there are obviously some reviews that ""extreme"" on both sides but if after reading multiple you see a common theme, it's likely true. I currently accepted a new position and actually brought up a few of my concerns I gathered from glassdoor and asked what the company was doing to rectify/move forward."
"Went to my GP regarding some random little medical problem and as he's writing out a prescription for something he looks up at me and says ""I'm assuming you'll want some antibiotics for your skin too?""

"If you were up for it, it might have been fun to tell them that you were planning to start a family, wait for them to not hire you as a result, and then report them to the EEOC.

There's a reason why most companies forbid interviewers from asking  questions like that, and it isn't manners."
"I was raised to be dependent and insecure. For me, it really clicked when I'd heard that men often comfortably apply for/pursue things they're unqualified or underqualified for.. but it never ends up being a barrier for them (oversimplification, but work with me here). It annoyed me so bad that I realized I was aiming really low with my ambitions.

I'm a college student so my scope is limited. But I thought, fuck yeah, I've overcome a lot, here goes nothing. Applied for scholarships that seemed ""elite"", got one that changed my life.

Even though I struggled academically at times, I applied for Honors. My essay and resume got me in. I sent my resume and cover letter to funding sources and internships that I never thought would consider me. They did, and it was WILD. 

Not the same kind of thing, but instead of wasting my time wondering if I meant anything to a man I liked, I asked him what he wanted. He said ""I don't know"" (hah) and we're together a year later. 

I finally found myself worthwhile of investing in.. Eating better, sleeping better, treating myself to manicures and nicer-looking clothes. I do things now I didn't think I'd ever deserve. I'm less of a shut-in. 

Obviously projecting self confidence can't fix everything. But other people, in any variety of situations, may always doubt me and I can't be confirming whatever they have to say or think about me. I don't count myself out anymore, so in a way, I take that away from them too."
"my fav thing is when they complain ""fenty doesn't have my shade!!!!!"" because a) its obvious they're attacking fenty because it's the one that has catered to dark skintones more than any other brand and theyre bitter not everything is about them, and b) fenty literally has a shade for ALBINOS!! if someone with literally 0 melanin can find their shade then so can miss porcelain princess"

"Biggest obstacle is watching others succeed very easily/quickly because of their privelages....from a distance it can feel and seem so unfair that I have to work at least 3x as hard as others who grew up with money to get in a somewhat close position.

"I’d be lying if I said “oh god, where do I start” didn’t cross my mind after reading this question. 

I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about it lately. And I can’t narrow it down to one.

Have you ever felt like “wow, I’m actually a pretty decent human - I’ve made a lot of progress, I’ve put in the effort, etc.” and then all of a sudden you become aware of like 47 additional things you should probably be working on? That’s this year for me. 

I have a tendency to be pretty self-centered. Not intentionally and I really wish I wasn’t but it’s the truth. I get defensive as well. I can be pretty lazy sometimes. I have a hard time confronting things directly and try to avoid vulnerability at all costs even though I know it’s necessary. I’ve got a short fuse. I’m flaky. And I think I’m too hard on myself which contributes to my lack of motivation to make significant and consistent changes.  Because I don’t know how or where to start. Basically, I’m a mess. 😅 But only like 33% of the time. I hope."
"Making your SO responsible for your happiness, instead of a reason to be happy.

Not accepting apologies, not letting things go.

Fucking haemorrhoids.
"I have plenty of insecurities but most of them are things you might expect/not be surprised by (hair not bouncy enough, lopsided breasts, cellulite, that sort of thing). Probably the one insecurity that most people would find weird is that I am nervous about the length of my toes. I have weirdly long toes and it sometimes look like someone attached baby fingers to my feet instead of normal toes."
"Grandmas and grandpas holding hands, strangers fawning over the stray cats I know, clueless guys who unabashedly buy sanitary pads for their girlfriends, tourists who look relieved when they find fellow tourists who are willing to take photos of each other so they could all go home with nice photos...I have more but those are my faves.

"I was going to say I’ve done it for my younger brother too. 

The craziest time I had to help him out was a few years ago. One of my friends was going through a real tough time in his life, and he got hooked like crazy on drugs. He came to my house really high and drunk one day. After a while, he started joking a
and telling my brother he should try drugs too; he was really persistent about it. He even shows the drugs at one point and urges him to take it. My brother was 12 at this point in time. I was obviously furious. An argument ensued. It escalated very quickly. Hands started being thrown, but luckily other people were there to break it up fast. That’s the only time I’ve ever gotten physical to protect a male."
"Had the same best friend for 16 years. We went to the same tiny school together which had slim pickings for boys. She started dating a 15yr old when she was 18, and she knew I was uncomfortable with it. He was her first serious boyfriend and I knew she was a nymphomaniac. I started talking to him to make sure that he was happy and that everything was consensual because I knew she could be pushy. We became friends and a few months into it, he tells me that she’s emotionally abusive and threatening to cheat if he doesn’t do what she wants. I confront her about it, and she’s convinced that I’m secretly in love with the kid. She ends our relationship but I maintain contact with him to make sure he’s doing alright. One night, he calls me in a panic saying that she’s threatening to drink bleach because she cheated on him again and he tried to end things with her. I called the cops and her parents and she ended up in a mental hospital for a week. I still can’t believe how quickly she changed right in front of eyes. She ended up cheating on him a couple more times over the span of another year before he finally left her."
"Some common advice in the not-too-distant past was that unmarried men should borrow wedding rings to appear more responsible and not only increase their chances of getting the job, but they might be offered extra salary because they had a family to provide for.

By contrast, married women were advised to *remove* their wedding rings because any sign that a baby might be a possibility shot your chances of getting the job to hell.  Hell, *any* woman under the age of about thirty-five was approached with caution.  You were seen as a liability.  

Pretty fucked up."
We met through tinder. We had shared friends it turned out but we didnt know of each other. I told my family we met through friends
"not a huge hobby of mine, but the ""bar or no bar"" argument within the competitive Dance Dance Revolution community gets extremely heated. I went to a convention and attended a DDR panel out of curiosity where this was one of the topics. pretty much there's a bar behind the arcade machines so people dont fall of that people will lean back on and prop themselves up to make dancing less tiring. as soon as the topic was brought up one kid stood up in the back and yelled ""bars are for bitches"" and full out anarchy broke out in the room everyone was yelling at each other. As an outsider it was hilarious to watch.

&amp;#x200B;

Also as a bonus story, afterwards a kid started using the machine they had set up outside the room and used the bar, and a kid came behind him and knocked his hands off the bar mid dance."
I just got married this past weekend. I haven't even downloaded the guess on how best to regulate my wife's hormones. Just so much to do!
"Actually something non-physical.  A few close friends have told me that I’m really accepting and nonjudgmental... that they feel like I’m a safe person to confide in.

Physical quality? My hair.  It’s thick and unruly, and for almost my entire childhood and teens I almost always tied it up.  During high school, my mom would insist that I have it chemically relaxed, because she said it made me look like a witch or a hobo.  I recently switched to using sulfate and silicone free products and quit washing it so much, and now it’s shiny and wavy.  Still thick and tousled, but it a manageable way.  I get a lot of compliments on it.

Ditto. It’s a thing. I always wished I had visible collar bones. I think it’s the prettiest most feminine thing ever.
"I had an acquaintance who was looking for a new place at the time, so he found a place with one more bedroom, and we got a place together. My work gave me a position with far more hours, enough to make ends meet. It wasn't ideal, but neither was returning home, and I'd come to like the area, so I worked with what I had. It's been nearly a year, and I've since met another, far better local guy."
"Historically it mattered a great deal when stitches looked good back and front because needlework was used for tapestries and banners where both could be visable. In clothing, a neater back stitching meant ( still means ) less of a chance of the thread being snagged. 

I used to be a Certified Master and can do pieces where you cannot tell back from front but, if it isn't going to show, even I don't take the time."
Yoga: the most controversial topic of debate in yoga is probably cultural appropriation and whether it's OK for yoga to have become so popular in Western cultures (especially when it's changed so much from its roots)
Yes. People who would make bad partners are better off single. It isn’t fair to make someone else’s life worse in order to make yours better.

Bruh, were you checking out the goods before you continued on this halfway arranged marriage plot?"
A lot of things just take a longer time. I took 6 years to finish undergrad for example because i was working 40-60 hours a week in the beginning of it which really screwed my gpa the first few semesters. I also never made a lot of friends in those years because i would go to work right after class and i would have to turn down their offers to join them every time.
In highschool I had the ends of my hair dyed pastel pink and a few guys asked if it was natural 🤷🏻‍♀️
"Yes. He proposed with an orange paperclip bent into a ring, on bended knee. I told him I wasn't taking proposals without large diamonds. Then he proposed to all the other girls in the class, one after the other.

"It's actually not.  There is a dog anti vaccination movement, but over vaccination is a separate issue.  It's more to do with being revaccinated when it's not needed (antibodies are still present) and also things like how a 5lb chihuahua gets the same dosage as a 150 St. Bernard and the like.  Vaccines *aren't* risk free, but they absolutely are well worth the risk, but we do need to do a better job at tailoring vaccine doses and schedules to what is appropriate and healthy for the animals."
"Um hi? Are you me? The crooked cervix thing was rude when he made a sound like ""uh-oh"" and then ""there it is"" like, bruh. That fucking hurts. My feelings and my vagina. Be careful down there."
"This will vary by the type of job, but if you’re interviewing for a professional job yet nobody on your future team has been there for long (and the company isn’t new), it often means the environment sucks and turnover is high. And it’s probably worse if the only people who’ve been there long are stern, know-it-all “lifers” and the people in your demographic all leave within a year. 

Other things that would give me pause: Super homogeneous teams in professions that don’t require a specific demographic makeup (and few really do). If your future boss can only manage people who are like her/him, they’re probably going to be a shit boss even if you fit the mould. If they have no real plan for training and onboarding new staff—you’re expected to know how they do things by way of mind reading—you’re being set up for failure. If they speak poorly of previous or current employees (outside of stuff like “sometimes someone drops the ball and it’s stressful”) in front of you during the interview, it should be a major red flag. If they try to find “clever” ways to ask unlawful questions anyway, they’re pretty much gonna be sleazebags."
"How long has the job posting been up &amp; how often is it re-posted, is a good indicator. 

I see ads from the same restaurants here, over and over, which tells me they are impossible to work for &amp; the new people quit almost immediately. You should not go through 3 executive chefs in 2 months..."
It's NEVER flexibility on the employers part.
"Yeah, this really shocked me when in medical school we were taught to always screen for domestic violence if the patient is pregnant."

"Not a question but in high school I had two guy friends who came up to me excitedly saying they found a really weird pen

It was a tampon"

"Yup, because he wanted us to get married when neither of us had financial stability (I was only 20). When I pointed this out, he told me we’ll live in his parent’s huge basement (it was) where his awesome parents would help us. I pointed out that I wasn’t comfortable living with the inlaws, and his mom had a tendency to be very controlling. 

His response? “No my mom will be so good to you, she’ll be like a second mother to you”

That’s a complete lie, it would have been a consistent power struggle between us, she LOVED being the woman of the house, and was not about to give it up any time soon or even share the role. And obviously her son was completely oblivious and thought mummy is best, always. 

Between that, and his financial irresponsibility (bought me a huge obnoxious ring, then bought himself not one, but TWO new cars. He handed one car to his parents) while having a job that would not sustain his habits and expenses, I had to break up with him. 

Thank everything for that, I dodged a bullet. He married a woman a while back and they’re both broke as hell."
"I totally agree. At least this doctor seems interested in the problem and potential solution. That’s huge IME with doctors, many of whom can’t even manage one second of eye contact before they’re scribbling a script and leaving."
"I squint one eye more than the other when smiling and because of my vision my head is almost always tilted to one side and I feel like it’s sooo noticeable, especially in photos."
"I had an online relationship for two years with a guy I had never met. I felt like I got to know him so much more online.

We finally did meet. And we will be having our 8th wedding anniversary in the summer, so I think it worked out pretty alright."
I agree. I don’t think relationship experience has much to do with what kind of partner someone is.
"Miscarriage. It's much more common than most people realize, and no one talks about it until it happens. My doctor's office (not the dr because she wouldn't speak to me - another story - receptionists and nurses) literally did not even say the word, even when they sent me to the ER. 

This is, unfortunately, such a common thing that it seems completely ridiculous how little common knowledge there is about it."
a guy asked if i took my nipple piercings out would the leak milk for the rest of my life since there's holes in it now
"Ah, yes, the pAiL pRinCeSsEs who complain that it's SO HARD to find anything for their transluscent skin so why should someone darker than paper get more shades? They get dragged to hell and back on  /r/muacirclejerk and it's hilarious."
"Because it's so rarely about the underwear/ trash bins/ dirty dishes, at least IME. Bonus points if doing a 2nd shift to play mommy after work leads to less time to, say, play video games, lower sex drive, etc... and you get called a ""nag"" for not wanting to jump the bones of a guy who relies on his SO for dinner, chores, upkeep. Yuck, nothanksonthat"
Yup. Human cats unite lol
"I’m proud to say that I get compliments on my veins every time I get blood drawn. It’s quite flattering to hear it so many times: “ooo nice veins” or “you’ve got some great veins”

I used to be insecure about it because in school they called me grandma hands. But I bet y’all don’t get these compliments from medical staff! Ha ha ha!"
"I'm her already! My boyfriend gets the side with the fan because I hate how it blows my baby hairs in my face, I get the side with the door so I can pee approximately 15 times."

"Mine told me whilst trying to insert the speculum that I have a “very small inlet”.

My fiancé said, I could have told you that."
1000% unprofessionality status achieved. bing!

Therapy. Not just therapy but spend time finding a therapist that you feel comfortable with.
"I know I’m in love with someone when I think about them and us and I feel nothing but everlasting joy and warmth. 

Looking back as a person who is in love now, I realize that I used to be in love with the idea of being in love when I would constantly obsess over what the other person was doing or wonder how they felt about me and overall just feel worried and sad on the inside. I realized I was in love with the idea of being in love when I knew that the other person caused me pain but I continued wanting to love them anyway, disregarding my own needs and letting it break me, all in hope that eventually it will be better."
"First figure out why you're chasing it; what's missing in your life? It's almost like an addiction, always chasing that high, addiction settles when were trying to distract ourselves from something else, or cope with an issue. 
Second, learn how to love yourself. Part of the high of falling in love is the feeling of being interesting and attractive to someone else. Be that for you by praising yourself, spoiling yourself and taking good care of yourself. As such, you won't need to someone to always fulfill it for you (this will help in long term relationships too)."
"When I was still actively drinking, losing my job because of it. I admitted I was an alcoholic that day on the phone with my best friend (now my fiance), standing on the street twenty minutes after being fired.

Later I was at that same spot in the city and saw I had been standing in front of a restaurant called the Rock Bottom Cafe. Hadn't even noticed that irony at the time."
"I sleep on the left side, because it's the Crip side."
Omg I have that same condition with my shoulder blades! Had no idea it was that rare lol
"I did it twice :-) 
The first time, I spent an incredible summer with him, learned a lot, travelled across his country, and when it was over after 2 month, I left with crazy memories and a good level of English and Spanish. 
The second time, I barely knew him and almost 3 years after, we are still madly in love. Even if it had to end tomorrow, I wouldn’t regret any of it !"

"I am most self--conscious about my breasts.  They are big and not perky.  I told my boyfriend that I had been thinking about getting a lift and reduction.  And he said, ""Please don't. I love your boobs just the way they are."""
I imagined her pulling your shoulder blade up and this suctioning slurping sound like pulling it out of mud and then propping it up like the hood of a car to the side and then massaging your muscles that were now uncovered

"I was 19 he was 20. 
We were each other’s first..everything.
We we’re engaged. 
Our baby was 2 months old. 
I was destroyed. 
He then took off.
I was never the same. 
Shit happens."
Bouncers are usually pretty good at judging people.
"Haha, I got ""ooooo you have a very nice Cervix"" at my first smear test and then, when having a stretch and sweep done last week ""such a favourable cervix"" ... Lovely"
"He turned out to be a lying asshole. I ended up back in my home country with no recent work history to be able to get a job, no friends as they'd all moved on, I lost half my possessions, and a few years older my chance to have children was greatly reduced following the whole thing."
"Animal rescue. The drama in that world is overwhelming. Bullying, one-upping, general nastiness. Ugh."
I’m trying to develop a stronger sense of self-discipline. At the moment I tend to cave into my immediate desires despite knowing that it’ll hurt me later on.  I’m pretty tired of having to clean up after myself like this all the time
"I weighed 282 at 5'3"". I convinced myself that I was perfectly good looking and the damage to my health wasnt that bad despite doctors claims. I jokingly told my cousins 6 year old that I was so fat because that's where I hid all my secrets. Small children being the tiny unintentional savages they are she told me I needed fewer secrets. While that was a funny response it was also a wakeup call. I'm 72 pounds down now."
"My current partner who is 32, hadn't had a girlfriend before me since he was . He'd casually dated a few people right before me, but up until the two people he saw in the last year before we got together he'd had a 10 year dry spell. Mostly related to depression, weight issues, and lack of confidence. On the flip side, I'm 26 and haven't gone more than a few months without at least a fuckbuddy since I was 16.

&amp;#x200B;

Some advantages are that he's very autonomous and self sufficient. I read all of these things about women mothering their boyfriends and at least as far as home and self care goes, he's definitely got his life together more than me. He's a neat freak and a decent cook. He's also got a lot of solid friendships, and has a support system well established, and a lot of hobbies, which is great for me as a person who likes a lot of my own personal freedom. I'm a PhD student - I need his D&amp;D nights and Warhammer painting days to get shit done.

&amp;#x200B;

Some disadvantages are that he's not always very good at establishing boundaries. It's better with me because I'm proactive about checking in, but I knew him for a year before we started dating and saw how badly the girl he dated casually before me treated him. He has a tendency to isolate when he's feeling down, because that's a thing you can get away with with friendships. I think in general he's not used to the level of communication I prefer - both on a micro level in terms of how much texting I like during the day, and on a macro level of discussing relationship questions/issues in detail. Because I have more experience and worry about repeating mistakes, I tend to discuss thing proactively, whereas he's more of a reactive communicator. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a fantastic relationship overall."
"Growing up, I remember being hungry. Not having anything to do. Not being able to go out. Not participating in school events like school trips, the prom or anything that involved money basically. I used to do anything I could for money, though my brother was always the more entrepreneurial one. I always had odd jobs. He'd steal stuff and sell it to people at school. I remember often the only thing I'd eat in a day was a 1/3 of a can of sweetcorn. 

But the most long-lasting obstacle is I never had and still do not have the safety net that many of my more affluent peers had. It's completely changed how I made life decisions. I couldn't take risks, I couldn't wait for 'better' opportunities, and I was utterly determined to make sure I could be financially independent as soon as I could. I've been financially independent since I moved out at 18. I've been working since I was 14 years old, part-time during school and full-time in the school holidays, all through my university years.

It also affected how I viewed job prospects. I couldn't afford to do unpaid internship, so all my work experience was in entry level jobs. Still, I had multiple graduate jobs lined up before I started my final year. I never considered taking a 'gap' year, it didn't make any financial sense. I wouldn't consider opportunities that didn't give a good 'return' on investment. For example, I was asked to consider a master's degree by my tutor at university but I looked into it, couldn't afford it, didn't think it would make much difference to my earning potential, so didn't consider it further. I did end up getting a master's degree but it was paid for by my employer and I did it whilst working full-time so there was never any break in my income.

Now I'm financially frugal. I have a big emergency safety net saved up. I am risk-adverse and tend to put my money into safer investments even if they provide a lower return. I plump loads of money into my pension. I have good insurance policies.

Essentially I made a better life for myself by moving out, going to university, working the entire time to get loads of experience and look highly credible, and then by being a highly competent worker in every job I've had. I've progressed quickly, gotten promotions and looked for new jobs when my pay looked to be stagnating."
"Met on a website for kinky folks with the intent to just hook up. The first meeting somehow turned out to be a proper date with a cheek kiss at the end instead of a negotiations session.

We tell people we were introduced to each other by a friend lol"
"Not a doctor, but I had to have my fingerprints done for a security clearance, and was told that apparently I have very unusual fingerprints. “Tented arches” on almost all of my fingers. The guy was rather impressed, and told me I better not commit any crimes, because they’d probably catch me pretty quickly..."
Because nobody else is going to and somebody needs to do it.
"""Should the dungeon master fudge dice rolls, for whatever reason?"" is always a really hot topic. I've seen people getting angry over this, at least on reddit. Not so much IRL for some reason."
I like this thread because it reminds me of ways to self care
"Yarn snobs are the worst. A lot of people start off with acrylic because why spend money on fancy yarn that's gonna get messed up? Plus crochet can be a great hobby if you're poor, but you're gonna end up with acrylic unless you hit a REALLY good sale. But some people will throw a fit if you present a piece that's even been in the same room as acrylic yarn."

"You enjoy spending time with them now. You like their personality, characteristics and values as they are. You're not looking to change them or hoping some big gesture will magically improve everything. You're not forget waiting for the next step of commitment. I think in the most stable and healthy relationships, those big milestones are only affirmations of how you already feel and not an expectation of how you world feel."
I jokingly told my kids that only winners get ice cream. It is now the motto of my 7yr old's baseball team. I don't think the other parents are impressed.
"""Are you going to breastfeed?"" With the tone of ""You're going to breastfeed, right?"" And being told countless times how horrible formula is and that it will basically ruin my baby just to line the formula company's pockets.

Turns out, I *can't* exclusively breast feed my baby. She was losing too much weight, was dehydrated, and being chained to a pump 12 times a day was ruining my mental health. So I started supplementing with formula on my midwife and lactation consultant's advice. But I'm still grappling with the guilt and shame other people have been putting on me about it since before she was born. 

Now whenever feeding comes up I just want to yell, ""TRUST MOTHERS AND THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO MAKE THE RIGHT FEEDING CHOICE FOR THEIR CHILDREN."""
“Wow you’re a lot heavier than you look.”  Had a technician at a later time in my life tell me I looked heavier than I was. Good stuff.

"We switch what sides we sleep on, usually depending on who has to be up first and who's place we're at.

Mine, and I'm up first? I'm on the right because the alarm clock is there. I'm not needing to be up? Left side because it's closer to the bathroom door.

If we're at his, it's the other way round. If he needs to be up first I'm on the right, against the wall. If he doesn't need to be up, then I'm on the outside - again, so I can get to the door easily (weak bladder problems lol)."
"This has happened to me too! When I was a kid at the dentist, the dental hygienist called me ""juicy"" because of how much saliva I make. It's stuck with me ever since lol

There was a study published a while ago that said that people with anxiety have increased rates of saliva production."
"Airport greetings! It makes so happy to see families reunite, spouses hurrying towards each other, kids running at break neck speed towards grandma."
"Yes. 

I was pregnant for the first time, in a foreign country, living with my husband, working full-time time, with a visa status that was very fragile. 

My husband got into a very serious accident and was in a coma within less than a year of our wedding. While he was in the coma, my work visa was denied, and my company declared bankruptcy. So now, every plan in my life was on the verge of collapse. I might have become a pregnant widow kicked out of the country into another where I had no health insurance and without work. 

Luckily, the medical staff did am excellent job and my husband pulled through. We were able to apply for a marriage visa, and my company's insurance ended up giving me full time pay for an entire year.... An entire year of maternity leave.... 

My husband wasn't able to do his job anymore because of the accident, but he ended up using insurance to buy a business in town, which stopped his two hour commute every day. 

In the end, everything worked out great. But had he not survived, everything would have been a bit different....

Nothing turned out like we planned, but it did turn out ok in the end. Some things better, some things worse."
It’s also great that dad knew before he passed.
Spoiler alert: It's not.
"Betrayed yes, by the one person who swore up and down that they were madly in love with me. She came home one night, sat at the dining room table and calmly told me she wasn’t in love with me anymore and wanted a divorce. The first 15-20 seconds every morning is how long it usually took before I remembered she was gone. That lasted a year, now I just work really hard trying to forget."
"Yes. He was 26 had not had a girlfriend and was a virgin (I was 21 and just left a 8 year relationship), it was about 16-17 years ago and the thought of googling someone was not in the forefront of my mind yet. I worked with him so why would I want to do that.  Turned out he was addicted to porn and was on probation for sex offence. When he was 18 he tried to force himself on a friend of his sister (she was 22) the brother (his friend) pulled him off beat him up. He ran but turned himself in a day later and pleaded guilty and went to prison for 6 years. Had several years of probation. He only told me when I wanted to go to a beach in another county and he couldn't go because of the probation, he had to get permission. I was livid but stayed with him for a few more months, then found out about the porn addiction which was massive and that he was cheating on me. 

He stayed with that girl he cheated on me with for about 7 years, she got pregnant, but they cheated on each other several times over the years. He's reached out to me here and there and said it was a huge mistake to leave me. It wasn't for me!! Anyway yeah, google your dates!"
Four seasons in HK. Watched the new years fireworks from the infinity pool. Truly a once in a lifetime kinda thing
"Just the other day I took my kids to visit my grandfather. My partner grabbed the baby, the other kids all piled out of the car and went inside. 

I was just about to sit down (been inside for two minutes MAX) when my grandfather asked where my 3yo was. 

Yup. She was still in the car. 

She was sitting in her carseat watching Peppa pig and drinking her water bottle with zero care. 

I felt terrible all day and had horrible visions of my kid dying in a boiling hot car. 


Another time, my eldest came home from school and said he had hurt his arm at school. 
I took a quick look, deemed if fine (no swelling or bruising) and gave him an ice pack and sent him off to play. 
That night he complained that his arm was still hurting and cutting his dinner up was painful. 
I told him to stop trying to get out of eating his food (he's the pickiest eater out of my kids) 
Next day, he goes to school and I get a call from the nurse telling me my son's arm is still hurting him and maybe I should take him to the hospital? 

I take my time getting there and grumble about taking him for an x-ray...

 He'd broken his arm. 

I cried when they were putting on his cast and felt like such an asshole. 
Now the moment any of my kids are injured, I'm unbearable. Practically calling an ambulance and convinced something is broken."

"You can get irritation from having sex often/ for a prolonged period of time/ without enough lubrication. I don’t think she was having an r/badwomensanatomy moment, seems like she was just talking about some temporary stuff."
"Yes :) I’m my boyfriend’s first girlfriend- we started dating when he was 22 and I was 19. He started dating late because he’s very shy and a bit passive, and he told me he never felt the way he felt about me for anyone else, which is really sweet. We’ve been together for almost 5 years and are very happy :)"

"A comment on here actually, right from this sub, just a week ago. A lady talked about how much her body can do and how much she appreciates to be able to give great hugs, walk etc. 

I realized I would never talk to a loved one the way I talk to myself. I never appreciated what I'm able to do but instead was always focused on my flabby belly. It's so ridiculous if you look at it from a different perspective."
"I spent 2 years of my life not eating because I was so depressed. I was 30 pounds underweight. 

When I finally got to a good weight, someone told me “you look healthy”, and that’s the biggest compliment I could’ve ever gotten."
"Yeah...I read that part and thought “this has to be fake”. I just CANNOT fathom how someone just says (maybe in a tone like) “yeah, he just kicked her and dragged her into the house” like in a “who give a shit”. That is absolutely unbelievable."
"Camaraderie around female-centered experiences -- the experience of being a woman in the world.  They help me feel less alone and crazy about that stuff.  Tutorials for aspects of ""girling"" that I am not comfortable with -- clothes and hair and makeup.  Commiseration about dating men."
I work with plasma and they are not all the same level of pretty. Congrats.
"Oh also uncastrated versus castrated dogs  ! I have this conversation with people on a daily basis on the dog walk and despite the clear benefits of castration (eliminates the possibility of testicular cancer and greatly reduces the chance of prostate disease, reduction or elimination  of aggression caused by testosterone and other male hormones, prevents urine marking and straying to find females to mate with, and is also a deterrent to dog thief’s wanting to breed from them!) so many people insist that the dog should have its testicles intact or else it’s not a “full” male."
Wearing dresses. I always get compliments that my outfits look put together but there's no matching or effort involved in throwing on a comfortable dress.
I think I would have laughed for so long he would have just gone home
I *am* the senate!
"Oh my gosh, this reminded me when I though I have cancer.. I felt so many lumps in my breasts and panicked :/ Ended up being very fibrous breasts so regular hand exam for breast would not work for me. Now I just do ultrasound once a year. Sucks thst fibrous breasts can be kinda painful..."
"Grew up in a house where you have to talk over people to be heard, can definitely relate to this one."
"I, also, tend to feel attacked and play the victim in a fight/debate. It's such an instantaneous reaction that it has been really hard for me to realize that the only reason I'm feeling pissy about what/how something was said is because I'm playing the victim. 

I used to be passive aggressive but that's one area where I've been able to recognize a behavior in myself that I didn't like and take steps to change it. It took a long time to get good at it, but now my gut reaction is to be really direct about what happened and how it made me feel."
When I was a teen my doc said my breasts were “nice n soft” and i just giggled awkwardly because i didn’t really realize at the time the medical significance of her statement!
"Not a doctor, but a dental hygienist was all up in my mouth doing dental hygienist things and said “wow you have hardly any gag reflex”"
"I was 25 when I was pregnant and I already sort of look young so I had a huge issue with people infantalizing me. And I was really emotional so so many people thought I wasn't ready, knocked up, a burden to society and on and on. Baby wasn't planned but we'd been married for 6 years, I had a good job...so being treated like a literal baby having a baby really hurt."
"Seeing a lot of people saying they met on tinder here. 

I guess it’s odd but me and my s/o have never lied. People ask how we met, we say tinder. Big deal. Maybe it’s awkward for those who ask but it’s not for us... Its just the truth."
"He was *very attractive*.  He said, while smiling mischievously: ""Your heart is beating really fast""."
"Maintain a good skin. Do the simple stuff - drink lots of water, use sunscreen, choose a good scrub and a face wash (they don't have to be necessarily expensive, research product reviews, ask people who have used it), change your pillowcases regularly, wash your face after coming home, etc. You feel good about your skin, it helps get the confident glow, and you don't have to waste money on a ton of makeup."
"Weightlifting! Sumo (wider stance, ""shorter range of motion"") versus conventional stance for deadlifting, flat back vs arched back for bench pressing, using straps/gloves for heavy lifts, mixed grip (one hand over and one hand under) for heavy lifts..."
"Also, looking for a ""ninja"". I'm a teacher and I saw an ad for a local charter school that's looking for ""educational ninjas"". NOPE. That means work for less pay than the public school board, with fewer supports and a for-profit company that would call a teacher an ""educational ninja""."
That to combat my bad period pains I should have a baby 🙄
You'll work eighty hour weeks but one a month after all that week's work is already done we'll go to the Mexican restaurant down the road and get 2-for-1 margaritas. You will have to pay for them yourself. Attendance is not optional.
If that bouncer had a show where he successfully sets up drunk people in bars I would watch the hell out of it.
I would love to be in that sort of relationship.
"Yes. It was my first proposal. We were both in the Army. I had orders to go to Alaska when we met. I wanted to go to Alaska (34 years later, I still want to go to Alaska!) He didn't want to lose me and he proposed. I turned him down. About a week later we happened to be at the same club and he walked me back to the barracks. He cried and proposed again. I said yes that time. I wish I could tell you that the marriage lasted."
I had them investigated but they followed all the laws.
Lol that was a cute read! Puffy Puff!
So sad. My friend is in a physically abusive relationship and says this is her favorite movie. I told her the real world just cannot be like that or its toxic :(
"Obligatory, not a woman.

She'd been cheated on bad in her last relationship, that was with the man she lost her virginity to and it broke her pretty hard. Around a year into our relationship she went to university. 6 months later, on my birthday, I'd drove down to surprise her with a visit. Walked in on her with another guy.

Completely destroyed me. How could someone who has suffered at the hands of a cheater, then chest on someone? We're actually now very good friends and her current husband has been one of my long time friends. Turns out though she cheated on him a couple of times too."
"A man older than my father once told me if I brought him dinner and let him crash in my hotel room, he’d be willing to sleep with me even though he doesn’t usually like fat women."
"I had gone to a service shop at a car dealer. When I handed my keys over to the guy at the front desk I warned him to be careful with the pepper spray on my key ring. 

He deliberately sprayed himself to show me how tough he was (iirc he had been in the military before) and stood there for a while as his face turned red and his eyes watered. The spray ended up getting in my throat a little and we both had to run outside."
"Also, be weary of fake Glassdoor reviews. I once worked for a company that would demand staffers to bury the 1 star reviews with fake 5 star ones.
Super shady, but it happens a lot."

"I went a little extreme at 19 and fucked off and lived off-grid in a cabin in the woods on a very remote island in Canada. I was mostly alone, and spent two years there. It was amazing. Not for everyone, for sure — but I owe that experience for most of my self-confidence and independence."

"I love all of these, I’m honestly a little afraid to get engaged and married because it’s going to be so much planning that I don’t care about. I don’t want a shower, a bachelorette party, or a big wedding. My boyfriend has so many friends, though!!!"
"Better self-care habits, I've been ignoring my needs after I got a promotion and my two best friends moved away two years ago.  I didn't realize how important the smallest effort (nightly skin care routine,  making better food choices,  meditation, and other things) can make a huge impact on my well being and those around me."
I’ve had a guy ask if my tattoos were real. That was pretty silly. Also if I wear glasses to get attention from guys. Oh and I nice had a guy ask if I chose to have smaller boobs 🤦‍♀️.
"I applied for a job where my experience didn’t perfectly align with the requirements in the listing.  I got far along in the interview process.  I didn’t get that job, because their immediate need was for some of the experience I lacked, and there was a candidate with spot-on experience.  But they liked me so much, and thought that the experience I did have would be beneficial, that they created a new position for me."
