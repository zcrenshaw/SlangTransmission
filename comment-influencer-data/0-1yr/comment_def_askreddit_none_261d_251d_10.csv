"I’ve seen the other side of this too though, with people thinking it must be easy to make a living from YouTube since the people they follow seem so normal. It’s obviously very possible to earn a living from YouTube, but if my kid was in their late teens and their main career ambition was streaming video games, I’d def have to sit them down and explain the reality of the situation.

I wanted to be a rock star as a kid. I got a guitar for my 13th birthday and got really dedicated to learning how to play and write songs. My parents were always very supportive, but I’m also extremely grateful that they stressed the importance of being financially stable as an adult. I played in original bands for awhile, but the money sucked, so I eventually started teaching lessons to kids and joined a wedding band. Now all my work is closely tied to music and I earn a decent living with it. 

Long post, but my point is that while it is possible to make a living on YouTube, I think it’s important to consider what aspects of that job appeal to you so you can diversify if things don’t work out. Editing, writing, operating a camera, lighting, mixing sound, etc. are all skills that would benefit a youtuber but that can also be applied elsewhere. It’s just important to keep an open mind and not get too dead set on one career path, especially one as competive as running a YouTube channel."
Lol this is def some Miami ass shit. Was this in the wynwood area? 
"My friend and I used to get together and play board games. Monoply never ended well btw. In college, we started the tradition of watching the Return of the Jedi and falling asleep before they go to Endor. (this happened 7 more times)

In some states, fireworks are legal - be sure you are safe if you are going to blow something up. I believe 18 is the purchase age. We def. set fireworks off in NJ one time. That's was really really fun.

I'm planning on being alone this year - so i'm going to make a plan for my resolution 500 mile in one year. loose weight, art work, reading ect. I might drive down to the beach to sit on a beach and watch the new year come in. 1.5 hr drive. Silly i know but i love the shore. 

Cook something awesome for yourself...something you wouldn't normally do! 

It's going to be raining here tonight so i might take a walk in the rain with some bubbly or tea as a cleansing experience...there's something very cathartic about rain..."
