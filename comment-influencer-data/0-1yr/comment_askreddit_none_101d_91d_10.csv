just the stupid response from a troll that i was expecting.
"So much this.

&amp;#x200B;

Not that I'm rich, but I have ""enough"" where lots of my time/money/effort goes into making sure I maintain what I have and not lose it. Continuing to work in something I might not be super happy about and paying insurance on everything to make sure I'm reimbursed if something was to happen etc.   
I feel when you have nothing/little to lose, you are far 'free'r'."

"I don't remember this so, heres my familys point of view.                


Once I lived in a small trailer up in West Virginia and I have little memory of what it was like there. We had a trampoline, nice old neighbors yada yada, but one time when I was sleeping, my grandma seen a little ""boy"" the boy was watching TV, my grandma called out my name, no respond. Then the boy climbs the walls onto the ceiling. 

This is not fake, if you say it is I will message a mod."

"&gt;Hold on, do me a favor and highlight the part where I asked for, hinted to, or in any way made any statement that anything should be free ever? Oh, yeah that‚Äôs cause I didn‚Äôt. 

Nah, you're just whining that things cost money.

&gt;You‚Äôre lack of ability to understand is indicative of your position (and that of your family) in the lower-middle section of society, and that shit will never change.

You don't know diddly squat about my position. You leftists really need to make up your mind, one day I am a selfish, rich asshole and the other day I am a brainwashed wage slave. Pick a narrative and stick with it, please. I am getting a whiplash from this nonsense.

&gt;P.S. if you praise capitalists who profit from your labor while owning no means of production yourself, you are not a savvy economist nor an intelligent capitalist or American, you are a bootlicker. 

I am self-employed, buddy. And no, voluntarily selling your own labour doesn't make you a bootlicker. Not everybody aspires to be a NEET and live in their mothers basement until they die.

The wealthy (production owners) would thank you for your loyal and blind service to the system they‚Äôve designed against you, in their favor, but they don‚Äôt think about you for even a second

Good, because I don't think about them either. All that matters is that we are both consenting adults that agree to trade one thing for another.

&gt;INB4 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a lousy communist, socialist piece of shit! If the country is so bad then leave!‚Äù
&gt;I‚Äôm a capitalist, but I‚Äôm just not fucking stupid, so...

What are your objections to communism and socialism? Sounds like it is right up your alley."

"Uhmmm, there's a reason a man's sexual market place value reaches its peak at age 50. Social status, high income, security, etc. These robots won't provide any of it.
At the same time there's a reason women's sexual market place value is said peaks at 18(some say 16 without laws), and rapidly falls from there. The looks and feel can more easily be replaced by robots."

"I seek out women who are confident and powerful, and I guess with that comes a love for control. I haven‚Äôt found a single woman who is confident and powerful, that also allows their partner to have some sort of say over themselves. I like women who know what they want and go after it, and have noticed that not only do they go after it (which is fine), they put you and what you need/want last at all times, don‚Äôt let you go after what you want, and don‚Äôt really give thought to how you feel or what you‚Äôd like to do."

That‚Äôs a very stupid and unethical thing to do. Don‚Äôt be so cheap. Don‚Äôt try to screw the business owner like that.
"That is what I am saying my dude, what is practical depends entirely on how much money you make at your job.   
For me, if I had the seed money to build a house, it would be more economical to build it myself, as opposed to paying people 3-4 times what I make an hour to build a house for me, on my current income."

"In this situation, we had the conversation others weren't supposed to hear. Our family looks rich from the outside, and we are. My sister, who was 5 at the time, constantly eats meat at home, but she just REALLY likes meat. When we went to a Chinese restaurant, my sister said loudly in Chinese ""Mommy, I want meat."" It made us sound like we weren't feeding her quality food despite being rich. We saw a few people giving us dirty looks."

"Secretly visiting a mental institution at night wearing nothing but see through panties is a particular sexual challenge for experienced women. You will get cock, sure, but probably under circumstances you did not expect and hearing words you never thought you'd hear from adult men. Plus, retards are usually aids free, so, there's that. Just make sure to also take a gun on case it gets ugly, and get your ass out of there before dawn."
You have to do something to change that.  Don't set unrealistic standards and try online dating. I'd bet you can find some great dates out there.  If you're nice and you're attentive it goes a long way.

"These things obviously aren't simple enough for everyone to understand how they work. I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time spelling out every detail.

There's also wikipedia that can be used as a good reference as well. There is a huge amount of info out there you just have to look it up.

"&gt; I mean what do you expect? Chinese's xenophobia, racism, and hatred of anything none chinese is pretty rampant. It's bound to become common knowledge eventually.

In general, the average Chinese person loves America and American people.  They love American culture, movies, food, celebrities, music, television etc etc.

In general, the average American can't name 5 Chinese people, knows nothing about Chinese culture, has never seen a Chinese movie in their life, gets all their knowledge of China from racist r/conspiracy types like you, and thinks the Chinese are xenophobic, single-minded, subhuman racists completely absent of morality.

But yes, I agree... it's the Chinese who are the racist xenophobes."

"Let me be more specific. If the following things are considered by you while dating, then your partner's wealth or wealth background was a factor in your relationship: 

- You enjoy the benefits of your partner enabling eating food and attending events at a nicer place or nicer level by paying at least slightly more than you paid, at any stage in the relationship
- You enjoy the benefits of your partner enabling travel at a nicer place or nicer level by paying at least slightly more than you paid, at any stage in the relationship
- Ability for your partner to provide ingredients for a fancy meal at home, whether they cooked or not 
- You enjoy your partner living alone when you do not, because you get to go to their place for privacy together -- they can afford this because of money, and this privacy and space contributed to you developing feelings, causing you to continue to pursue the relationship
- You enjoy the material benefits your partner being able to contribute financially to the household at least slightly more than you 
- You enjoy the hobbies they introduce you to that cost them more money than you'd be able to afford
- You enjoy the result of their higher education (how they're able to converse, what they can converse about), which is the result of their ability to have their family or themselves pay for college

I could go on. Of course money matters. People don't go out to specifically find someone wealthy, but many people do care about the things that _come_ from wealth, and that's effectively the same thing."

"The fact that the climate change debate is full of shit, and instead unify over the mass extinction currently taking place. 
Climate change happens naturally, and there is no science to prove that mankind has any impact. First it was global cooling, then global warming, now climate change. Every prediction made on the matter that has passed has been false.  
However, the destruction of ecosystems across the globe and the fact of species either going extinct or becoming endangered is provable and back by science showing that mankind is responsible and the direct causation of the issue, rather than the loose correlation described by climate change activists. 
The right would support the fight to end the destruction of earth‚Äôs environment after shown the data proving we are experiencing a mass extinction event caused by us and they aren‚Äôt taxes with carbon emission taxes that they believe to be based on false information/lack of proof of impact. 
The left would support it because it‚Äôs eco friendly and makes them feel better and would save the planet without paying carbon emission taxes with no proven impact beyond more money for the government."
