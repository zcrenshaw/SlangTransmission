No sir it seems I have inherited the love for vagina just like my moms
"A little bit. I grew up with a lot of evangelical friends who would go on about how ""unified"" and ""complete"" the Bible is. While reading it, I realized this was just overcompensation. It really dawns on you how it's really just a collection of poems, law codes, letters, blueprints for buildings, and prayers, all written for different reasons over hundreds of years, stuffed into the same book. And if it really was meant to be like God's little instruction book for all of humanity, why does it focus 100% on the Hebrew people? The Bible strikes me as probably the *least* unified book I've ever read.

Still, the Bible has some pretty good stuff. It does have inspiring quotes sprinkled around. So now, I can see how someone might take comfort in these individual verses. But it makes me wonder how many Christians have tried to read the whole thing and became disillusioned by what they saw. If anything has changed, I just feel sorry for those who go on about how ""unified"" the Bible is, because I feel that deep down, rationally, they know the truth."
"Since you're a Biologist, have you tried *making* new friends?"
Fuck that you storm in that room make sure you look everyone in the eyes to show whos alpha and get into bed and fart to again show alpha and fall asleep 
I can see the headlines now: Sexiled Man Freezes to Death in Salt Lake City Tragedy.
"And in response, your asshole packed a bag and has moved the fuck on before the storm comes and rips its (w)hole life apart. This shit is gonna be worse than Katrina. "
Yes it was my first child. Named him Oliver. I now (after 4 long grieving years) am pregnant with my ‚Äúrainbow‚Äù baby. 28 weeks along- but it doesn‚Äôt replace my first boy. I‚Äôll always think of him. Every single day. 
"It depends. I‚Äôm not aware of the exact temperature and obviously the colder it gets, the more it negatively effects me.

Right now internal consumption of anything cold is incredibly painful and results in explosive diarrhoea.

Cold weather, windy weather and rain makes my skin appear in rashes and blotches. The pain is quite immense. It feels like I have been burnt."
"I don't answer questions about the copypasta without seeing a documented (high) IQ score first, sorry. "
I also cooked there for a while. Once one of my co workers gave me a viagra and dared me to take it at work. Longest 6 hour shift of my life.
Bummer
What's it like getting stuck in an infinite loop of 'go ask your mother'?
Relatable
"Depends on what you mean by hookup. No I never had sex with them.  But I went on to have what I hope to be lifelong friendships with many beautiful women,and for that I am grateful."
"So far hasn't been too bad. I was peeing fire this morning, and pooped just a little bit and it felt like magma pouring out.  Wasn't the best.
"
"I‚Äôm 20 now :)
Tbh I always knew. My moms were there from beginning on and I never questioned it. They always were 100% honest with me. They told me how one mom was my biological mom and the other wasn‚Äôt. I was always in contact with my dad and still am but he was never a parental figure in that sense. Like he didn‚Äôt take part in my upbringing. That‚Äôs how it was and that‚Äôs how they explained it to me. It‚Äôs always been like that. We never had ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù. There was no need for it."
What's your five-year plan?
"It‚Äôs hard, especially at this time of the year. But, there are some big events happening in my life that I don‚Äôt want ruined.

I got engaged last month, and my fianc√© and I are starting a family. I had to think about our future kids. Do I want them to go through what I went through? Do I want them to be around drugs? Absolutely not.

They don‚Äôt need to worry about if Grandma and Grandpa are going to show up, if they‚Äôre going to ask them for money, if they‚Äôre going to go to their house and find them dead. That‚Äôs my responsibility as a parent to stop that from happening. My fianc√© doesn‚Äôt need to deal with that shit either. I‚Äôll never really know if they are sober, they‚Äôve lied about it so many time I lost count. I can‚Äôt do it anymore, but I still struggle with guilt.

I feel like I failed, like I‚Äôm supposed to save them, like it‚Äôs my fault that they use, like I did something wrong, that I wasn‚Äôt a lovable enough kid. It hurts, it‚Äôs hard, I cry about it all the damn time. "
"Sick, dude. Did you turn out gay then, as we are supposed to? "
"Before I ask my question, I just want to express to you how horribly sorry I am and I know that nothing can ever replace the hole in your heart,

Would that have been your first child?"
That‚Äôs why we wear aprons. üòÜ
"Has this changed your perspective on the Christian religion?  
"
"Wow I‚Äôd never thought I‚Äôd open Reddit and see this headline. With that being said...

GOOD ON YOU DUDE. That‚Äôs hella cool and unfortunate all at the same time. RIP to your BF. Glad you survived that though. Good read."
how cold is cold in measured temperature or does it depend? 
Picking up guys haha. Its way easier. Also: Grindr lol
That sounds too bad. 
"Kinda, I started in 2011; I was 19 years old, and when I first started there most of the girls knew where to get yayo.  As time went on there was a revolving door of of 18-20 year old girls who would not be a source for cocaine.  Alcohol and partying was always a thing, but as you get older and the ‚Äúgirls stay the same age‚Äù it gets old."
"How old are you now, how old were you when you found out your parents where different and how did they explain it to you?"
"Heh, maybe someday. I'm done with sacred texts for a while."
I live in constant fear. 
"If you were my daughter, I‚Äôd hug you tight and tell you I‚Äôm very proud of you. Now go take on the world, kid."
Oh God. My mom's gonna be proud I made it to the news! 
"Can‚Äôt compare with anything, so I can‚Äôt really say. It really depends on the moms tbh. My moms were just really chill persons and it wasn‚Äôt much of a topic that they were gay. I could imagine that it could be rough for a child to have a gay mom that makes a big deal out of it like ‚Äûlook at me, look at me, I‚Äôm gay and i can still raise a child‚Äú and everyone would know you as ‚Äúthe kid with gay moms‚Äù. That could potentially suck a lot. 
As my moms didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it tho and I was a very socializing little fella, I was known for other things.
So in overall I feel like I had the perfect childhood tbh. They taught me a lot and by a lot I mean tons and I‚Äôm really grateful for it. Also they put up with my shit when I was in my asshole teenage years, so yeah, thanks moms. Couldn‚Äôt have wished for better parents. I mean that."
"My hCG level was very low. They did a vaginal ultrasound and the OBGYN informed us that the baby was not developing correctly. She also could not find a heartbeat. She told us twice, that she was 100% sure, that the baby was gone. She asked me to schedule a D&amp;C then and there.             
I went back a week later to check on the progression of the baby 'passing' out of my system naturally, that's when they found a heartbeat. It was a different OB. I never saw the original doctor again. "
Well he kinda did the same for me a couple hours ago... Only I did it in a car and was faster lol
"Well, let's summon him: u/Niekisch"
"I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs not that easy. I‚Äôve got 3 children with a 4th on the way. We are very lucky where we live as we pretty much overlook wildlife and forest area.

My partner is disabled as well and both of our families live about 20 minutes away."
"Is it just me that read the title as 6 Flags being somehow responsible for the hospitalisation?

Actually, the TLDR kinda implies they‚Äôre responsible too. 

What did 6 Flags do to you? üòÇ"
This is outstanding. Helps if you read it as Morgan Freemen
"Was that why I started working there no.
Was it why I stayed there for so long, maybe to an extent."

"My dad is a colleague and a friend, yes. And yes, we have a Great relationship. It‚Äôs different but really loving and he seems to be really proud of how i developed as a human, whenever he sees me achieve something. So in a way he‚Äôs my parent too, just more passive.

He‚Äôs a great role model and I do strive to be like him in some ways. My mums had way more impact on my goals and what kind of a person i want to be tho.  And no, a male role model is not necessarily needed but I feel like everyone needs role models in a way. I mean, it could be Spider-Man or Cat-Woman or the friggin mail man/mail woman. Everyone looks up to somebody and that‚Äôs totally okay and good for your personal development (in most cases).

I never had anything I couldn‚Äôt talk to my moms about. We have a very close relationship and I trust them with everything."
Did you have rhabdomyolysis? Are you fully recovered now? 
"Many. I opted for a full autopsy before cremation. (Took 1 year to get back) and during that time I did genetics testing. The answer came from the autopsy and not the tests they put me and his father through. They tested for blood clotting disorders such as Factor 5 Leiden and also tested for Lupus. The autopsy ended up showing only one sign of abnormality, which was a slightly smaller (lower in weight) placenta. So they said that was the only issue they could see... meaning as baby grew larger and needed more- my body (placenta) couldn‚Äôt provide it. He died 4 days before I delivered him.  Xx"
"Note to self: Continue to not exercise. 

edit: glad you are on the mend op! =)"
"We came to Salt Lake City like tourists, we both live 50km away. I found a hook up, he waited for me (I took like 30 mins) then he found one and I had to wait for him"
I do as well! Do you also have any auto immune conditions?
"Am Roman Catholic, theology, church history and apologetics lover. 

The idea that it's all unified and ties perfectly together is peculiar. Some of it really is based for the age it was written, others are tied together like the messianic prophecies of Isaiah for the New Testament. 

Others like the ban on wearing mixed fabric are very much written for the period. IMO an issue the evangelicals frequently face is simply looking at the bible alone for context, rather than the era and reasons parts of it were written. "
"Great question. I wasn‚Äôt raised with much of anything and I‚Äôd like to teach my kids the same principles. Aside from buying a modest house and driving modest cars, I‚Äôm going to make sure they shop at TJ Maxx and have to do plenty of chores to earn an allowance. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll eventually figure out that they‚Äôve got money waiting since I don‚Äôt work at all, but I‚Äôm never going to tell them that they‚Äôve got money waiting. "
"It‚Äôs quite weird. One of them is ‚Äúmom‚Äù the other one I call by her name. Both of them combined are just ‚Äúmy moms‚Äù. Also when I talk about any of them I just say ‚Äúmy mom‚Äù so people never know which one I‚Äôm referring to lol. 
This should not be misunderstood though. There was never a difference for me between the two, regarding the ‚Äúlevel of mom-ness‚Äù. It just kind of happened so that I always regarded to the biological mom as ‚Äúmom‚Äù (and so did the non-biological mom btw - as in ‚Äúdid mom already tell you this and that‚Äù). "
Omg that‚Äôs the best one yet!
"No, I started it to get banned from The_Donald because they were talking nonsense. Now it just sits here as my throwaway in case I don‚Äôt want to comment on my main, especially because my main is just my full name and Google-able. "

"I think there's a lot of literary, historical, and inspirational value in the Bible. That's why I chose to read it. I think it's fascinating how a good chunk of our culture, moral code, and even laws, were shaped by it. Given my beliefs, I don't usually pay much mind to the God-centered quotes, but here's one I found to be truly heartwarming:

""Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action. And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything."" -1 John 3:18-20"
"Funny story actually - a little over 29 years ago, I popped out of my mom‚Äôs hoohaw and since then it‚Äôs been pretty easy to make sure I age every day and then suddenly, I was 29"
Next the Qur'an?
"That‚Äôs the word! I‚Äôm mostly recovered now, just have to be cautious about how much physical activity I do for now on"
"Pretty much everything. I spend probably $3,500 per month so I hate buying anything expensive. I got into golf recently and bought a set of old clubs for $100 from some guy on Craigslist. Wouldn‚Äôt even think of paying $2,000 for nice clubs. 

But to be honest, I **really** wanted a Nissan GTR for a bit. The insurance would‚Äôve been wild though so I decided against it. "
"It's used for harmful thoughts. Thoughts which are irrational and lead to mood swings. E.g. you make a mistake and feel ashamed. The thoughts which pass your head are of irrational nature then, like: ""oh, nobody wants to work with someone who spills water all over the lab bench. you are a looser. you never will get things done. you should stop doing what you are doing. you're a bad scientist. you should leave the lab"" etc. which ist quite catastrophizing and not rational. You learn to spot these cognitive mistakes and to think rational about things. And to think helpful thoughts instead of toxic, paralyzing thoughts. Spotting those is hard when you start, but it seems to get easier with time. At least for me ;) "
Alright alright alright
Did you start this reddit account to only talk about being rich?
"Oh yes, I absolutely held my boy for a while. It was beyond ‚Äúshowing me the remains.‚Äù I was induced and gave birth like any normal mother would. Push, push push- out he came, medical team cleaned him up, swaddled him, and handed him to me to hold for as long as I needed. He looked like any normal baby except his skin was more fragile. Absolutely beautiful little boy otherwise. I held him for about 20 minutes or so, kissed him and then said goodbye. To answer your question it did in fact help a great deal with accepting myself as a mother, and with my grief process. If I never saw or held him I‚Äôm not sure how broken I would be today over that choice. Thanks for asking and thanks for your kind words. Xx"
"Hello!

Not that I‚Äôm aware of. I‚Äôve only had a basic ‚Äútest‚Äù for it. How were you diagnosed?"
Any bad experiences for you? Bullying? You got siblings? What about father figures? All the questions I answered. I‚Äôm interested in how it works out for others.
"as a straight guy, having my entire sex life revolve around my butthole sounds like a total nightmare lol"
How are you coping? 
"This is such an excellent question. As you can imagine, there were not many happy moments. However, I mentioned in another comment a manager at a Steak n Shake that was extrememly helpful. He gave me food and let me sit inside the warmth, talked to me for hours some nights and let me get to know him on a very personal level. I remember looking forward to seeing him most nights because he was one of the only people who never judged me and listened to me. I hated nights he was off and I had nobody to converse with. 

There was also one specific instance when I was stealing food. I usually went to this mall that had a Panera and at the time, outside the door, they had a display with loaves of bread to show the different types. I thought I was being discreet when I stole a loaf of bread but an employee noticed and came up to me when I was eating it on a bench. I was terrified of getting in trouble but she asked if she could make me anything free of charge. I was embarassed and pretended like I was fine and didnt need anything. She went back and brought me warm soup and a sandwich with a bunch if free fruit and bags of chips in a plastic bag for me to take. I wanted to cry I was so grateful. Never spoke to her again but I vividly remember that.

Those are what stick out to me the most. There are a lot of kind bros and gals out there and it really showed me how to be humble and never judge anybody because everybody is fighting their own battle."
"I have no question, but take some karma.

My sympathies."
"As a gay guy whose entire sex life revolves around his butthole, this sounds like a total nightmare."
"Well here's the thing my mom and my dad got divorced when I was about 13 (I'm 18) and since then she has been a lesbian. So I do have a dad and I still see him at least once a week. I do live with my mom's though because I don't get along with my dad that much. I've never been bullied for my mom's being gay but obviously my friends will crack jokes about it occasionally, not as frequently anymore haha. Imo being raised by my mother and her girlfriend has been a much better experience than being raised by my mother and father. So to me it makes no difference whether a parent is gay or not as long as they are good people. My mom still hasn't come out to some of her extended family so she still struggles a little bit. She also happens to be the only Christian in my household so she's had to learn how to accept herself. I also have 3 brothers (1 older 2 younger) and they would pretty much agree to everything I said. I'd say the hardest thing about it is my dad's hatred towards her and him blaming the divorce on her for being gay even though it was his fault. Sorry for the long response i don't usually get a chance to discuss this hehe."
I assume you've moved near the equator then if you aren't already there?
"I was dared to do so. I had done it before, but only 6 wings. Apparently it didn't hurt enough back then.  This time I did 11 (my friends ate one).  I powered through my 11, and I really didn't feel good after.  I went home as my stomach cramps were just too bad.  I went right to bed. 

However my tab was paid off (about $60 I'd say) and I won an extra $60. 

Usually you win a t-shirt and go up on their wall when you do the 12, I didn't know this at the moment, otherwise I would have.  Oh well, was still fun.  Not so much all the cramps I had last night and early this morning.

"From someone who also had a bit of a shady past when I was a teenager, before ultimately making something of myself, I‚Äôd suggest you don‚Äôt deliberately hide everything. 

You say you can‚Äôt talk about it, but I think you‚Äôll find people will be impressed rather than think badly of you.

Similar to you, I had some very good friends who didn‚Äôt make it out of their teens or early 20‚Äôs. Very few people come back from that and achieve what you have. Hold your head high. 

Edit: Sorry, I know that‚Äôs not a question. Just wanted to tell you I think what you‚Äôve done is great. "

"Not really, my mom has nonchalantly mentioned 4 times that she had no money for car repairs or her boyfriend‚Äôs birthday, so I‚Äôve given her maybe $20,000. But no one else really asks for anything. Occasionally I‚Äôve got friends that are all too willing to have me buy drinks, but that‚Äôs not too often. I don‚Äôt have many friends and the close ones know not to even ask. "

No but seriously. Don‚Äôt be afraid of bullying or having trouble supporting your child in the right way. 
It‚Äôs 100% about the effort you put into it.

Good luck to you and remember that just because they are your parents doesn‚Äôt mean you owe them anything, that includes the right to have you in their life. They didn‚Äôt earn it so they don‚Äôt get to have it. "
"Not until this very moment.

"Very cool question!

"None of the above. Well, maybe a mixture of both. I‚Äôm the biological son of one of my moms. So they didn‚Äôt adopt me. Then the not-biological mom adopted me but that was when I was already in elementary school, which was due to the laws being changed in that year, I believe.
 I always knew my biological father. So I had a father in my life, who wasn‚Äôt much of a parental figure for me though. I saw him once or twice a year, when I was a child. I‚Äôm now seeing him a lot more frequently. He was in a toxic relationship in my childhood-years and his gf didn‚Äôt want him to see me for some reason.
He was my moms close friend and he agreed to have a child with my mom. It was always clear that my moms would be my actual parents and he would be available to contact for me and he would obviously be my biological parent but he would never be responsible or function as a parental figure. 

Hope everything is clear here. Kind of struggling to find the right words in English. "
You have no idea. I'm the butt to everyone's joke
"That‚Äôs a hard question to answer. I highly doubt I‚Äôll ever do a 9-5 again unless it‚Äôs my own startup that I‚Äôm really excited about. In the next year, I want to marry my girlfriend and help my parents plan their retirement. In 10 years, I would like to revolutionize peer-to-peer marketing (one of the ideas that I‚Äôm excited about). "
Ohh fuck thats right. BRB
"Not really, actually. I've seen all the usual sketchy quotes that people like to throw around, long before I read the Bible. But most of the Bible isn't anger-inducing so much as...boring. Reading Moses' 613 boring laws really gets you to simmer down a bit, haha.

God, especially in the Old Testament, can behave like a violent maniac at his worst. But this is no different than the gods of Greek mythology, so why aren't people complaining about them? I guess the answer would be ""Because people don't still worship them"", but the way I see it, every religious person has their own individual idea of what God is like. That's why they'll basically plug up their ears whenever OT God's dirty deeds are mentioned - it challenges their worldview. Yahweh is a product of the brutal society of the ancient Hebrews. Getting angry at him is like getting angry at a petulant child. Not really worth it.

I think the another reason people get so angry at the Bible is because they have these unrealistic expectations. They think it'll be this clean, family-friendly instruction book on how to live a good, pure life. But in truth, when it's not being boring, the Bible is filled with murder, lies, incest, rape, war, and genocide. If you try to look at it as the 2000-year old historical artifact it is, you'll find reading those parts can actually be kinda fun."
"The relation is that my visit to the park for a day of fun could have resulted in my death. Not at fault of the park, but simply because I spent the day on aggressive rides bumping my head and body around while my body was dangerously low on platelets.

My brother has some mental health issues and refuses to get help. He‚Äôs using drugs on and off, and goes between being homeless and living with them on and off. I can‚Äôt save him either and it was killing me trying.

They are both still very attached to our parent‚Äôs and refuse to get out of that toxic environment. They‚Äôre making they‚Äôre choice to stay comfortable, even though it‚Äôs having severe consequences for them. It was affecting me too much, I couldn‚Äôt just cut off my parent‚Äôs and keep them in the picture, I tried that previously and it wasn‚Äôt working.

Nothing could prepare me for the day of delivery at 37 weeks gestation; celebrating the birth of our baby boy, and mourning the death of his brother, who I didn't want let go of in hospital. 

Just today, I was watching my child quietly playing on his own, wondering what things would be like if his brother was still here, by his side playing with him. 

I had testicular cancer 15 years ago. According to doctors post surgery, I was never going to have children, as my remaining testicle wasn't producing sperm. 

Strict diet, lifestyle changes and 5 years later, my remaining test was producing sperm, albeit, just enough where even IVF (ICSI) was going to be a massive feat. 

My wife is currently 34 weeks pregnant, with another miracle on the way - our little girl. 

This post caught my attention and I felt compelled to share my story. 

Your post and OP's brought be back to May 2017, where at a routine ultrasound, the sonographer had to leave the room to call in the doctor. The problems started at 16 weeks gestation, where everyday with two beating hearts was a blessing, so whilst we were prepared for the worst, when the doctor had come in and advised, 'his heart has stopped beating', we were crushed. 

I am so sorry for any parent who's had to go through this, and I thank you all for sharing your stories.

Was your stool black?
Not sure I understand. Hoping it‚Äôs not a sinister comment.üòî
This makes no since. You say it hasn‚Äôt been too bad then describe something absolutely terrible.

"No, my uncle didn‚Äôt play a big role in raising me. That was just a random coincidence. I had weird puberty beard and we were at my grandma‚Äôs together, so he bought me a razor and showed me how to use it. That‚Äôs pretty much the only thing he contributed. (Not saying that in a mad way btw, it‚Äôs not his job) 

And yes, my moms covered everything. They would‚Äôve also tried to teach me how to shave if nobody else did, I guess. There‚Äôs nothing a mom can‚Äôt teach you."
Ur mom gay
I must admit it‚Äôs been a few years since I‚Äôve had a cold pint. Father of soon to be 4 so I don‚Äôt have a lot of free time.
"I talked to my mom about this today, cause a friend asked that same question. 
I had a lot of men in my life. As in: I had several male kindergardeners. I had uncles, granddads and other male figures in my life. 
As I said in another comment, I also was and still am in contact with my biological father.
I never focused on any of the male figures as in trying to find substitute for a missing father though. 
My moms put a lot of effort into my upbringing and made sure I had everything I needed. They did everything for me that a father could‚Äôve done. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve missed out on anything at all. 
I even learned things from my moms, that you could consider ‚Äúmanly‚Äù, that other guys my age didn‚Äôt even learn from their dad.
I think, it‚Äôs just about the effort parents put into raising a child. "
"I've had worst burning shit before.  I like to eat very spicy.

I add a few drops of [Death Nectar](https://www.atbbq.com/grinders-death-nectar-hot-sauce.html) to a lot of my food, which is 337,000 SHU on the scale. Not as bad as these wings, but sometimes it hits me harder than I expect."
It should.
"That last sentence hit home, and helps a lot. Thank you for your words, and kudos to you for being strong. "
"Surely if you're staying at the hotel you should be allowed to stay in the lobby? 

What is both of your genders? "
Reading the bible actually caused me to be athiest. Did the read make you angry at all?
"Who is the dad, a friend? Do you have a good relationship with him? Do you have him or someone else as a male rolemodel, is that even necessary? Were there ever questions you didn't want to ask your moms?"
"Might have missed the boat on this but I have a few questions. 

1. How many of those in the study were molested themselves as a child? Does this usually result in the control side of molestation or attraction (i.e paedophelia). 

2. Are you getting a sense of the average percentage of the population who have this attraction? Could you estimate how many are attracted and don‚Äôt act on it? 

3. Are these people also generally not good people in other areas of life? 

4. Based on your research how would you explain the reason for it as a compulsion? 

5. Any thoughts on how best to break the cycle of abuse? 

This is just curiosity so don‚Äôt feel obligated to answer them all. "
I can‚Äôt even remember honestly. It‚Äôs been a while and I deleted the comment. My username alone was probably enough to get banned. 
Are you called Ben by any chance and is your father Ross? 
"So as a British person, no cold pints for you sir? "
"Are you ok?

mentally and or physically? "
"Planning to read other holy text, if yes my recommendation is Bhagwad Gita!!"
I think you should find better friends. 
Are you happy? Do you think you'll ever go back to work/commit to a 9-5? Maybe learn some trades? What do you want to do in the next year? 10? 20 years?
Banging your coworkers can be a nightmare. He might have dodged a few bullets there.
"I was 27.       
I did report this. However, it was a military hospital so we never heard if anything came out of it. I have told everyone that I know (military/pregnant) about this just in case.       


The part that really bothers me is when the OB told us, she immediately asked if I was going to kill myself. She then informed me that just a few weeks ago she had a woman in a similar situation as me. She told me that that woman killed herself. I just wonder. "
"I would actually advise against that. You don't often hear about this, but there are plenty of sexist, homophobic, and generally bigoted commands given in the New Testament too. Even Jesus has some weird moments, like when he says that divorcing your spouse and remarrying is the same thing as committing adultery.

The Bible has some parts I agree with and some parts I disagree with. Personally, I think Jesus' message of treating others with love and compassion is inspiring, and truly worth emulating, but that doesn't mean the whole Bible is just as worthy. I think the best option is to think critically about the Bible before you decide whether or not you want to listen to it, and really the same thing goes for any book. Don't be afraid to pick and choose, and live your life the way *you* want to live it."
"It makes you feel on top of the world! You have loads of energy, and you're all kinds of turned on. You feel like you can do anything, and very talkative. You feel like the most sexy, most interesting person in any room. It enhances every feeling, and feels so goddamn good. You can drink more than usual, and party harder. It feels like lightning and ecstacy and perfection covering you head to toe. You're just so up and happy. 

You don't want to sit back on the couch and watch a movie, you want to do something crazy, be social, have a good time. And when the party is winding down? Just get another bump and you're good to go. Of course, the more you use, the more you need. 
I always crashed pretty hard on the comedown, so I'd smoke a bowl to take the edge off. 

The physical addiction was exhausting. When I wasn't high, I was exhausted, and sore. My head hurt and I'd be shaky and very depressed when I had to go a few days without. My anxiety spiked, and just seeing some near me made me fucking desperate. It's a craving unlike any other I've experienced. "
Any tips to not suffer the same fate when exercising?
"I‚Äôm very sorry. This is what happened to me, my baby died at 31 weeks. Had a really tiny placenta, they were surprised he made it that far. No other issues, just small placenta which led to IUGR and ultimately fetal death."
I feel like you belong in r/gatekeeping
"Please don‚Äôt apologize for the length of your comments! The more the better! I said I‚Äôm interested haha 

But yeah, that sound a like everything worked out for you quite well too in the end. Happy to hear that!
I can relate to the occasional jokes but I mean, it‚Äôs your friends, so you know, they don‚Äôt really mean any harm. At least that‚Äôs what I feel, when that happens. 

My moms also didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome out‚Äù at any point. They told people the truth, if they were asked but they never went out there and said ‚ÄúWe. Are. Gay.‚Äù.
So through that some people who are sensitive regarding this topic never really got an answer and just had to deal with the situation. My grandmother for example never knew my moms married until just recently. She didn‚Äôt really mind tho, as it was quite obvious at this point. 

Much love."
"Similar experience here. my mom was a heroin fiend and prostitute my entire childhood.  I had to cut her out of my life during college after she showed up out of nowhere begging for help.  I let her stay with me for the night and the next morning she had stolen my wallet, everything of value she could leave with, and the upcoming tuition payment I had been saving for the following semester.

I never saw her again before she died, but it was in that moment I realized there was nothing I could do to help her because she refused to help herself.

I spent years feeling guilty over what I could or should've done but in the end, it was out of my control.  I had to be the adult and protect myself and future family from the experience like you are with yours.

Just know you're not alone."
Who taught you to shave? 
"I had rhabdo from spinning too much. My CK was 27,000 The muscle pain was intense. Couldn‚Äôt exercise for weeks. I‚Äôve since learned that every workout doesn‚Äôt need to be a PR. 

Take care OP. "
"I was backpacking in NZ (like seemingly 99% of Germany... sorry about that btw!) and was woofing at a farm near Puketi forest and on the first night the farmers wife says ‚ÄûDown that hill is where the Maoris live. They‚Äòre all f***ing pimps, hoes and drugaddicts. [...] I‚Äòm glad you‚Äòre German so you know what I mean with the color thing.‚Äú 
I was so shocked I couldn‚Äòt speak. Left the next morning. "
"#YEAH, IN MY SMALL TOWN, A HOOTERS JOB OR UP AT THE WALMART, IS LIKE WINNING THE LOTTERY. WE USED TO DO THE LOBSTER CLAW TO NEW GIRLS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD FIT IN, THAT‚ÄôS WHERE YOU SHOVE FOUR FINGERS IN THEIR ASS, AND YOUR THUMB IN THEIR TWAT... LIKE A LOBSTER CLAW... COVER OURSELVES IN HOTWING SAUCE... SO WE WAS RED, LIKE THEM LOBSTERS... AND DRAG EM AROUND THE BAR AS FAST AS WE COULD. LIKE WATCHING THE NASCAR. THAT OL DALE JR... WHERE.

SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY MANAGEMENT WAS HARASSIN, BY NOT LETTING US LOBSTER CLAW NO MORE. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, NOT TOO MUCH HARASSIN. "
Is that the guy with the wrinkled balls?
"Oh man, here it goes. I worked at one for almost a year during my years at community college. Mom was not proud. Well at that time someone in the neighborhood was selling marshmallows laced with Xanax. Not big ones for smokes, but the ones you put in hot coco. Don't ask, I don't know. Well I had gotten a hold of a few, but wasn't about to take all of them before an evening shift. Also, Xanax has never been my thing, but I needed a couple extra bucks for rent. I told a couple of the girls about them when I got to work, and an hour into my shift my pockets were empty and my wallet was full. What I hadn't realized was one of the girls I gave them to didn't think they were real, so SHE ATE ALL OF THEM. I had sold her atleast 6, maybe 8, and at 2mg a pop, she had now taken 12mg of Xanax. For those who don't know this would kinda be like beer bonging a handle of any hard liquor, at once. It's not gonna end well. Anyway, she was fine for a minute or two, but the night was getting busy and her tables started to pick up. After about 20-30 minutes, I am working the front counter of the kitchen and I see her name on the next ticket with an order of 200 wings. Usually you can fit 50 wings on a plate and put 4 plates on a serving tray, holding all 200. So I loaded up a serving tray, and called her over to pick up her order. Without missing a beat, she picked up the whole tray, put it on one hand bent backwards and immediately forgot there was a step on the platform and all 200 wings went flying across the floor. She just got up off the floor like nothing happened. It was amazing. The whole kitchen died laughing. She went back to the dressing room and other girls starting cleaning up the floor. The manager came over to her immediately and demanded to know what she was on. By this point she looked really fucked up, but it didn't matter, she kept denying everything anyone would say. At one point I even came over and asked her if she was okay, and to see how many she had taken, and all she said was, "" I don't know what you're talking about, I feel fine."" Fucking ride or die bitch right there I tell you what. That's one of a few stories, I also put my balls on a girl's cellphone, I met an amateur porn star, and dated a Hooters girl that got offers for sex all the time. It was pretty sleazy overall and I couldn't wait to quit. Other wise it was just another job. Hope you guys enjoyed the story. "
"Ive never tested what temperatures effect me and England is pretty mild.

For me if I drink a cold drink I‚Äôll be hunched over running to the toilet.

Cold door handles are a prime way for swelling my hands up very quickly for quite a while.

Wind and cold weather makes my ears, chin and eyes burn "

What is cognitive restructuring? 
Currently I'm going back to school for Computer Science hoping to work as a Software Engineer for a gaming company. I also stream on Twitch every now and then. 
"Absolutely. To my knowledge, Paul was the first to say the doctrine that ""Jesus died for everyone's sins"". I find that Protestants prefer to focus on the ramifications of his death than on Jesus' actions and beliefs. Catholics pay more attention to the events of his life, but more as a comforting story than for any moral guidelines. Jesus' stance on the death penalty, wealth, kindness, and asceticism have gone almost completely ignored by most Christians."

"I'm not completely sober. I still drink socially. But the reason I did a lot of harder stuff was because I was depressed. I had a bad relationship with my family and as cliche as it sounds, I was using drugs as an escape. I realized when I got arrested a few times for minor pot and paraphernalia charges and almost got thrown in prison that I needed to change. At the same time, my girlfriend at the time was friends with a lot of shady people. The were getting busted by the DEA left and right. My life was crumbling all at once and just had a ""what the fuck am I doing?"" moment."
"I‚Äôm 27 now and I was diagnosed about two years ago approximately. So 25.

It‚Äôs a really unknown condition so treatment is pretty much next to nothing, I wasn‚Äôt born with it. So it‚Äôs something that people acquire."
