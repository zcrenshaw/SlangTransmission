"FNP here, had a first job out of school doing Medicaid risk assessment for insurance companies.

I basically had to do complete family/social extensive reviews and complete PE and head-to-toe AND make any new preliminary dx and referrals for the insurance company in 60 minutes...very taxing but it definitely helped me hone down my skills in getting information from patients quickly and efficiently and especially with my charting, but that's a different issue.

I have this one patient, and doing my thing getting their family history, etc, and get to drugs and alcohol use, normally pretty good disclosure about obvious things, especially if they are being treated for things like alcoholism etc. I get to smoking history and expect to hear 20 PPD for 15 years given the smell in the house and the opened blunt on the table that was pretty clearly going to be rolled before I arrived. Deadass woman with a 10 month old on her lap looks me in the eye and says no to any and all smoking history. 

I stop and look at her in the eye and say are you absolutely sure? What's this? *points to cigar blunt opened* 

Yea that's not mine. 

You live with a S.O. at all or roommates? 

Yea. 

Oh ok. 

I had gone over my self-imposed time limit on that charting section so I just wrote down 'no' in the chart and had her dx and referred for tobacco and drug abuse. I wasn't about to argue with a woman who couldn't admit an issue so clearly right in both our faces."
