"Even then, to a certain extent your actions are justifiable. I mean, EVERYONE else is frozen, but you still gotta, yknow... live. Time may be frozen but you still need food, toiletries, etc, so of course youre gonna walk into the store and take what you need. And your boss and coworkers and all your customers are frozen, so you cant make any money to pay for shit, so you *gotta* just go and take it. And sure, maybe you dont *NEED* a 85 inch hi-def TV with surround sound and every game console there is, but, I mean, for fucks sake, youre basically stuck completely alone for A YEAR. You gotta do something to keep yourself occupied.

"I'll never be the rock climber I was in my 20's, but hey was probably not going to do that anyway. It def affects my balance. I am technically disabled. But with orthotics that use some pretty cool tech, I can basically be a normal human, especially if I can wear shoes.

So I would say the difference is that if I had regular feet I probably could have adapted a bit more quickly."
"Idk if it's the same one but there's def a horror porn series on PornHub where this old lady has a vagina as a mouth, there's also one where a dude finds some huge ass spider in his basement and fucks it. The spider was so fucking creepy.

I was describing the vagina one to my friend and now we sometimes say, ""You have a serious case of vagina face"".."
