"I'm the first ever researched and charted down. 

My parents have both TITIN mutation. We all got tested in the genetic lab since insurance covered it! Must have been 3000$ a person."
It‚Äôs a thing you record videos on
Can you describe a ‚Äònormal‚Äô day in there?
Pun intended? Or happy accident...
Why is today your last day?
You build fences.... right?
I'm not
Do you prefer wooden or metal fences?
"I‚Äôm extremely comfortable with other people I always have been. My adhd mainly affects my actions. I love helping other people too. That‚Äôs why I want to look for a future in paramedics when I‚Äôm older. I also love reading, it‚Äôs a surprise to anyone that I can stay focused reading. I‚Äôm on Ritalin daily but sometimes I don‚Äôt take it because it can affect my sleeping patterns. I wouldn‚Äôt like to say perfectionist but when I start something I want to finish it and I want it to look good? If you get what I mean."
Much obliged my man.
"No. I‚Äôm largely indifferent to people but abuse of children is something I will never stand by for personal reasons.

I reckon seeing me would just bring back everything that happened. I doubt she would see me as a hero or even a decent person. I don‚Äôt want her to relive that. And if she does view me as a savior or someone who protected her she shouldn‚Äôt."
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that what‚Äôs ur passion?
Who is your favourite porn actress or actor?  How was your first favourite in the old porn days?

"ooooh that‚Äôs a good one. i really like cavetown, sara bareilles, and lorde :) but i know a few songs from many artists and i like a lot of genres"
"In the UK, what happens if a homeschooled person wants to go to university? Is it necessary to have a high school diploma or there's a different way to prove you're qualified to go to university?"
It was a joke man of course I know what that is
"She was as terrified of me as he was. He won‚Äôt ever do anything again though. I hope that I made her life a little better. I hope my actions didn‚Äôt traumatize her too badly. She couldn‚Äôt have been older than 12. I don‚Äôt know if she was really capable of understanding why I did what I did. I hope when she thinks back on it now she‚Äôs glad but I‚Äôll never know.

Put yourself in the shoes of a child in that situation. Someone was trying to rape her and then she witnessed some truly brutal things. She wasn‚Äôt raped but those memories are going to stay with her. I truly hope I never see her again but I also pray that she‚Äôs doing alright now and living a better life"
Fences.
"Yeah, ISIS beheading videos get to me though, it‚Äôs just fucking sick."

"Where did you work, and what did you do to get fired?"
"He wasn‚Äôt abusive, just had some different kinks"
Hell no lmao I got caught
"It depends, but I think for now I'll stick to wanting robots as long as they don't replace us humans in too many fields.
Robots would be amazing in third world countries or countries at war, carrying supplies or taking care of the wounded.
For some people, robots will increase their quality of life, for some they won't"
I have seen someone try to rape a child. That was the worst probably. I was ashamed just to be a part of the human race. I felt absolutely disgusted. That‚Äôs one of the only times I turned on someone who had paid me
"It isn't willfull ignorance though. It is an intolerance of other ideas. The other idea here is violent racism.

If acting humanely means tolerating violent racism, count me out."
Any big reality shocks when coming out? I just remember yawning and saying I wanna go back to sleep.
My nephew (13) is being discharged tomorrow from  his first stay in acute care. What are some ways that will make the adjustment home easier?

"Yeah, sure"

Is there a way you can get the real DNA sequence? Do you know whether it is a single point mutation that leads to one amino acid being wrong or an insertion (like in your example) or deletion that lead to a frame shift and the entire sequence being wrong from that point on and probably also too short? Do you know what these things mean?
You‚Äôre an asshole you‚Äôre going to cringe so hard later in life or when they get back at you
Are you a thin person?

You clearly don't have good life ahead of you. Good day
Where are you from? Is English your second language?

Do you ever cringe at things? And when were you diagnosed
"Random example! They tested a piece of muscle from me so they know what went wrong. 

Side note: they wouldnt let me see the muscle they took out from me. :c &lt;/3"
"Yeah, suprise suprise there are people in science that look at the crazy complicated universe and believe that it is created by an author.  You are just closed minded and to be honest I feel no need of convincing you of anything."
"You wake up at like 6 or something. You go out of your room and go to a rack with your hygiene products in a Ziploc bag. You take a shower. You go to the main room. Which is called the day room. You wait for everyone to finish taking a shower and go to breakfast. This is the same start for everyday. We have snack time 2 times a day. Sometimes we have art or music. You talk to people all day long. Constantly asking you how you're feeling. Most lie and say they're fine. Most of the day is just eating, playing cards, coloring sheets, and counting how many days you have left until discharge. It's so boring. It goes so slow. The lack of colors, no outside interaction. It seems like you world stops, but the real world goes on without you. Then you go to bed. Your first night sleeping is always the worst. Your mind is in an unformilar area. So your mind will try to stay awake to protect you. Even if you manage to sleep that night, the smallest noise will put your mind in over drive. It's the same. Everyday. It will drive you more insane than you already were."
What‚Äôs the worst Metallica song??

"And Justice for all. Death magnetic, and probably master of puppets"
"First two yes, I'm planning to see third one this weekend"
Definitely love. I had no idea how much he made until we moved in together. He‚Äôs the most amazing person I‚Äôve ever met and I never thought I would meet someone who I would fit so well with.
"I‚Äôm 20, located in eastern America"
"Been married 5 yrs, she accepted me almost immediately,  but our personalities do clash. To new step parents,  it takes time to be accepted. Discuss before marriage what is and isn't your territory, even the odd ball scenarios. Bio parent, you can't exclude the step parent from helping to raise your kid(s), and being included in things/events. We get emotionally invested/involved too. I treat my step kid like I gave birth to her, and she feels that level of love and commitment. Also ty for empathy."
"I don‚Äôt know a lot about the condition honestly, but my wife told me when we got together that my 13 year old step son (he was 10 when we married) has Aspergers but described it as ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù or ‚Äújust a little bit.‚Äù  Lots of other kids his age seem to be way more mature than he is, and I notice him getting excluding in groups, frankly, because he annoys the crap out of other kids his age. He is incredibly hyper active, bouncing off the walls, does a lot of random yelling and is constantly trying to get the other kids to ‚Äúwatch this‚Äù or ‚Äúdo this.‚Äù So I guess my question is, in your opinion is that an effect of him being on the spectrum or would you think he‚Äôs simply not maturing yet?"
"I literally just told you I am out there in my community doing volunteer and outreach work.

And no, the burden here is yours, the burden of proof to support your original argument that the Quran advocates for murder/suicide. Except it doesn't, and you know that, but instead of admitting your wrong you're going to keep trying to make personal attacks."
Do fathers / parents ever proposition you?
Thank you
"True, I mean they are social democrats so they can't be anything but pathetic... Still nice to see that they are gaining popularity."

Do you play a sport in particular ?
Is she part of your will
And what are you doing to help these people whore are wrongfully painted? Just arguing with strangers on Reddit about? If you actually gave a shit about them you would be out doing something to help them in real life.
"It's really not complicated: ""Do you want to live a society where everyone is doing X?""

Imagine what our country would look like if everyone was stealing hundreds of thousands of products, ensuring not just the owners of the company, but *everyone* involved in producing the product and bringing it to display received exactly $0.00 from the fruits of that product. Society would collapse."
I think he's broke
If you're a sales manager for a billion dollar company I'm gonna go ahead and wager a guess that you're doing fine financially despite shoplifting.

---------|----------|----------|
Do you have a contingency plan in case you get caught?|We have been caught more times than I would like to admit. But it's just a numbers game at that point, more crime=more opportunity to get caught. Buttt here's a few contingency tips, 1. You can always just run if caught.  Most stores don't have a policy for following outside stores(even loss prevention workers) and some workers just don't care enough. 2. Most guards aren't allowed to physically hold you or hurt you, usually just try and block your way. 3. Know the place you're going into and have an idea where exits are. 4. If you're caught, you're caught. Don't make a big deal out of it most of the time.  Even a charge like grand larceny could just be a slap on the wrist. Most states are don't care about shoplifting. (Maybe a night in jail and some community service) Own up to the fact that you were doing something illegal and got caught,  it's your fault not the police or guards, they're just doing their job( You don't have to be a dick to them) Sometimes if you're cool and compliant with them, they will just let you go and tell you not to go back.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd4jvd/)
i stole a pastry from tescos once, are you proud of me?|You're the child I've always wanted ü§ß|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eydbu59/)
Don‚Äôt those designer stores have high end security? Some having guards to check your person for any merchandise? How did you get past that security?  And are you now retired?|You would think that designer stores would but they have been our historically easiest heists. On occasion some designer stores have had alarm tags but you could honestly just walk out with items with a group of people like nothing happened. And if we couldn't do that,  most alarms are relatively easy to take off by hand and occasionally a special tool we had to pop them off|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd4tl8/)
Do you feel like a piece of shit?|Sometimes but I don't let it get to me too much.  We never take from small or family owned stores.  Just mostly giant brands worth billions where our shoplifting doesn't make a dent|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd57lg/)
Closest to getting caught? I read something about a condition where people steal with no good reason do you think you have that? Why did you do this ama?|Definitely, when looking introvertly my gf and I needed none of what we have taken. I think it may have just been a rush. I have been caught a few times but one time when I had gotten away with rings a bell and still gives me anxiety when I think about it.  I was checking out an expensive jacket that I wanted and was continuously bothered by this one worker (who mave have been onto us or just an annoying salesman). When the coast was clear I threw the jacket on and my actual jacket over it and we walked into a back elevator that already had another worker though she was completely oblivious to the situation. Heart racing but playing it cool we press the lobby button. And then comes the annoying worker, 3 feet away from us as door is closing. ""EXCUSE ME SIR"" are the last words he said right as the door closed on him. Now having a silent panic attack and my gf and I are staring at each other wondering what to do. Do we get off the 2nd floor and take the stairs? Do we go up and return the jacket? Did the worker tell security? It was too late, we were now on the first floor and there were 3 huge tree like guards standing at the door. I died a little on the inside BUT they had no idea! Walked out the door and half down the block before I ran as fast I as ever did for about 2 minutes|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd5r1b/)
What Type Of Items Where They? Like? Expensive? Cheap?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  (I Know You Said Designer But What ones)|I don't want to get too much into it but it varied from dollar items to well over 5k for a single item at a time. Electronics, jackets, purses, shoes, belts, jeans etc. Pretty much anything out on the floor was up for grabs.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd7s0e/)
Would you think about doing such a thing if its was the late 1800s and I had a shotgun to you and your girlies face? Would you shit your pants?|It was definitely infinitely easier to shoplift back then. No cameras, no phones, and I would most likely be packing too|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd8hnu/)
What do you do with the stuff?|I sold some things that didn't fit properly or didn't really like under inspection when I was broke and gave them as gifts to friends and family. But for the most part we kept almost every single item.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd5s1h/)
What‚Äôs the most expensive item you have stole? Was it easy?|It was at a famous designer store with many floors and a lot of customers. Placea like these are always easy. Easy to blend in with everyone else. It was a fur jacket retailed at 8,000 and was simply ""tried on"" by my gf and who just put her jacket over it. Walked out the door, got dinner after.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd6bx3/)
What was your biggest heist?|We've had much more expensive days than this but I just really wanted a bike. We went to one of those giant retail stores that sell bikes and found the perfect one and literally just walked past the cashiers. We were headed to the parking garage to floor and I see a worker looking at us with this ""what the fuck are they doing"" face and I just blurt out the 1st thing that comes to mind. ""Hey, is there a place where I can lock my bike up out there?"" He is absolutely baffled by the question as were in the top floor of the store and out there is the top floor of a parking garage and there's nothing but cars out there. We get past him as he was still probably questioning whether me or him had been smoking crack that day lol. She hops on the bike with me and we ride from the top floor to the bottom and ride off into the sunset like it was a movie.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd6vnz/)
Do you get that thrilll. Like someone will suddenly look to you .. And say ... Show me what are you hiding Under the jacket?|The fear of being caught doing something you shouldn't has always been such a rush. Though it has definitely died down. I'm older, more responsibilities, back in school and have a well paying job. I actually have something to lose now. Plus I pretty much have everything I could want at this point|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyd9099/)
Have you ever stole personal items from someone? If so can you explain|I'm am morally opposed to taking from an individual. Would I rob billionaire? No. Would I take from their store? Absolutely lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eydbksw/)
What‚Äôs the most money you have made in a week? And can u sauce some of that shoplifted Gucci?|Made like cash in my hand? Not much, like 1k. We were keeping everything mostly. It wasn't a job, more like a hobby  Made in a week like net worth of all the items? Around 25k worth of merchandise.  And no,no sauce. My sauce! Lol|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eydcqhd/)
Favorite video game ?|Apex Legends is a big hit for me right now|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cwnfin/i_have_shoplifted_over_200000_dollars_worth_of/eyddrw2/)

"that they are stupid southern redneck racist skinheads. That they do drugs, and have no job. People would be disgusted by the actual truth of the majority of them. Usually good looking, physically strong, educated, and work in the schools, police, military, ect."
"Just curious as to why you are doing an AMA?    


Do you need the money?  


Do you need food?  


Are you proud?  


Or do you just not give a shit?"
This is interesting from my perspective. I run a high end retail business in which the bonus given to me once a year has several factors but one is loss. That would be any human errors with registers or mixing up items or theft. So it actually probably does directly impact someone. The rest of my teammates who work for me also get a small bonus impacted by this loss $. Maybe just acting like you‚Äôre not stealing from someone directly makes you okay with the shit you did?
You‚Äôre ok. I promise you‚Äôre gonna be ok. What is your favorite band?
That‚Äôs a good band! You like classic rock then?
"How long have you been the step parent, and  how long did it take for your daughter to bond with you/accept you as a parental figure? Any advice for any new stepmoms out there? I completely empathize with difficult it must be at times."
Get the fuck outta there
How old are the two of you?
So true. And the costs go up for legit customers. Pay increases for employees are minimal or postponed.
It is a lot different saying God spoke the world into existence and every stray thought of a person creates a new reality.
What are some of the biggest misconceptions about fascists/neonazis?
"_Now_ you're going to try and take the righteous position? Once you realized you can't support your irrational hate with any actual evidence you resort to an ad hominem.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you'd resort to attacking me as a person without knowing literally anything about who or what I am, since that seems to be your modus operandi.

I do volunteer and outreach work in my personal time to help the disadvantaged, with a focus on immigration and cultural integration. 

What are _you_ doing to make the world a better place, other than spreading lies and hate on the internet?

How about instead of trying to convince yourself that the guy on the internet telling you not to blindly hate people without reason is wrong, you should consider taking a really hard look at why you feel this way. What lead you to this mode of thinking?"
Which state was the most drastic change from your home one? For example when I traveled from MA to CA I couldn't get over just how different the air itself felt.

Sounds amazing! Tell me more about it of you want? Where was it etc
"I'm back in school now and I have a high paying job which is especially why I stopped (mostly). This was never a "" life style"" for me,  just a side hobby mostly"
Are you good with finances... or just him? I had some old lady chasing me when she found out that I could buy a few G-wagons with cash.
"I care about groups of people being wrongfully painted as evil by xenophobes and nationalists who want to either increase or maintain their hold on power.

I care about being a decent person and not blindly following messages of hate, and would rather form my own opinions by actually learning about things instead of blindly following rhetoric put out by people with ulterior motives. 

I care about critical thinking more than I do propaganda.

If I followed the logic you're employing here, I should hate you because your country is sending us all your murderers and rapists."
"Ah okay, also do all you humans reply a week after? Even our worst would never do such a thing!"
"It might be if they were stealing to provide basic needs for their family. Op explicitly states they have no need of anything they have stolen. It's just for the rush.

"My friend's son is a teen with Aspergers - I would say he's pretty high-functioning, he loves to sing (even in front of crowds), plays piano and drums, and has a youtube channel. He's a happy kid, but as he grows older it's clear that he's different and not functioning like other kids his age. He has a couple of legit friends and they do sleepovers and things (but I can't help but feel that they'll reach a certain age where the differences will be more notable - hopefully they can stay friends). My concern is that his parents have never done much specifically in the form of therapy.  My question is, what kind of therapies could they do with him at 13-14 years old, that would help him transition to high school and maybe keep his friends and make new ones?"

"My apologies. I thought you were being sarcastic.

It is a disorder that causes one to have very argumentative, aggressive, irritable or violent behavior towards others... mainly figures of authority. There is no official cause or cure, though treatment can help.

It affects me throught out my every day life. It caused many problems at school for me as a child &amp; has caused me to lose numerous jobs as an adult.

If I had to describe it in a nutshell, I'm very hostile for no particular reason."

"Thank you for sharing your story. Have you ever considered travelling to a country and staying with a host family for a while? Do some manual labor, talk to people of different circumstances, talk to them about how they cope with their own problems?
I think there's much you could learn, and also teach. It seems to me that in these times people's minds get sucked away in our own thoughts, when we should be out there helping one another. When we should be experimenting different things in order to find out what we're made of and who we are. In order to find out that we are much more capable than we think.
I had a big depression when I was 24 and I couldn't find sense to my life. Ended up going to the countryside of my country, deep in the mountains of Per√∫. My story matched with many others. I found amazing people. We helped each other out. They actually saved me.
Sometimes a change of air is the boost we need. Sometimes it can lead you to a better place. It couldn't hurt but to try.
Nature also works wonders.
Just try it. All my best wishes to you, keep strong."

"I got in it from my parents knowing the right people because apparently being insane runs in the family. My sister is also part of this program and she is going to be the first one in their older teen experiments, idk what that entails. Previously kids were let out of this because of the effects of puberty at age 16 about.

I‚Äôm 14 now I‚Äôm apparently going to be better at age 15 and my brain will be wiped of my memory of all this. Yes I‚Äôm posting this on reddit so I can remember some things when I‚Äôm out."
"&gt;Dissociation?

It began with dissociation, and from there while I was dissociated I would begin to do things, then it was catatonia most days. I would pace in circles for long times thinking about such specific things. Eventually it went to entire days of not being conscious but for a few minutes or hours. Alot of times I had to piece together what I did later."

"Best thing, I think, would be getting to mess around with coworkers and playing the games and taking pictures using the cec photo booth, things like that.

"No, there aren‚Äôt any mix-ups. I don‚Äôt know what is in a lot of the drugs or in the shots, they don‚Äôt tell me. They do have a unique number to define each drug like a code that I do not know. For example I figured out 3305 is a drug that makes you crazy from another kid.

"theatre. i love acting and i work very hard at it (taking a bunch of classes, auditioning for every show i can find) but nothing. all my friends are constantly getting lead roles in shows so i‚Äôm surrounded by success of others but i‚Äôm not really getting far. i had a summer job in theatre this summer but to make a long story short, i‚Äôve come to the conclusion i was only hired because they felt too bad to turn me down. basically pity hire. (there‚Äôs a lot of signs that make that clear, but it‚Äôs too much to get into)"
"i don‚Äôt really know. i‚Äôve been working on them all for a very long time. part of me thinks the reason is because no one really gives me a chance to show them what i‚Äôm capable of (a role in a show, etc) but then other parts of me kick in and kinda know it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm not good enough to get a role in a show. i‚Äôm talking more classes this year outside of regular schooling so it‚Äôll basically become my entire life this year, hoping to improve."

"I've always toyed with the idea of teaching a course in business at an overlooked community college one day, with the hopes of at least providing some level of coaching/direction for young people who haven't found their path...

I can't really see myself taking on another job.  I'd probably invest in something reasonably safe like rental property and not take on big risks.  My goal for grinding so hard was to trade short term happiness/time, for more time on the back end.  I'd feel like it'd all be wasted if I kept at it until my 60's and became an absentee father/husband/family member.

Thank you for your kind words.  While I do find myself a happy person, I don't at all think I'm necessarily more happy than my peers on account of my career and what it affords me.  I do often wonder about my friends who have larger families, more life experiences, free time, etc.  The money will be useless after I pass (not sure if it's wise to leave much money to kids; I'd plan to donate anything above a safety net for my kids) - and I've grown a greater appreciation for developing meaningful relationships with my loved ones."

"I'll just copy and paste what I replied to someone else:

I'm actually relatively fit and healthy. I'm a healthy weight for my height (70kg, 6ft 1inches tall). I struggle to get upper body muscles, but I'm not sure how much that's due to diet or genetics. I cycle around 8-9 hours (sometimes 12) a day for my job and used to run 10km every day. I'm also not pale at all, I have healthy skin and hair. No issue with my bones, Ive only ever broken a bone like once.

I do have Crohn's Disease though, but there's never been any proven link between veganism and Crohn's. The vast majority of people with Crohn's have consumed animal products all their lives. There's studies that suggest meat and dairy are actually worst for Crohn's, which might explain why my case is so mild compared to some (many have to have parts of their bowel surgically removed). I sometimes get anaemia due to my Crohn's, as the condition means I sometimes struggle to fully digest food. I've been to see a nutritionist with regards to my Crohn's and they were fine with me being vegan. The few times where I have become anaemic I've just had an iron infusion to increase my iron levels. I also eat a lot of dried apricots for the iron.

Other than Crohn's I have no other health issues and I rarely ever get sick. Never had the flu, food poisoning, eczema, migraines, anything like that. I do get the cold virus like everyone else, but not often."

"It‚Äôs funny in a way; I agree a lot with what you said.

Like I said I have tried watching the documentary a few times but can‚Äôt bring myself to finish, so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs touched upon or something you experienced, but with me, when I would start asking questions just for more understanding I would have to go through deliverance (basically exorcisms) and would never get answers which A, drove me away even more and B made my questions....bigger. I am not religious whatsoever, but I‚Äôm not opposed to religion. I think it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs personal choice and it‚Äôs not a choice that you can make for anyone else. 

Its hard with my mother (the one who raised me this way) because my husband and I are not exposing our daughter to religion (not hiding her from it, we actually travel internationally extensively with her, but not teaching her a certain way is the right way) because she‚Äôs 4 and she doesn‚Äôt have the mental capacity to understand it fully yet, and I hate that I can‚Äôt leave my daughter alone with her grandmother because of fears of what she might tell my daughter.

"Thankfully no. If anything sometimes parents will outright tell us. One mom dropped off her little girl (one of my favorite kids I have EVER worked with) and mentioned casually ""she's on the spectrum, if you could just look out for her a little extra I'd appreciate it."" However, she was only about 5 and so it made a little more sense to mention it blatantly

I also regularly work with a preteen on the spectrum, yet another kid I adore. His family doesn't outright say it, it's more like in conversation they might say ""I don't know if you've noticed, but x is on the spectrum."""

"I was actually born with most of mine. The only one I‚Äôve gained is a mild allergy to cherries, so it‚Äôs less common than just having one from birth tbh and it kind of just came out of nowhere when I was eating a bag of cherries and my mouth started to swell up. I asked my doctor and developing a cherry allergy can actually happen if you‚Äôre already allergic to pollens of the same family (which I am). Also, sometimes an allergy can resurge if you don‚Äôt have a lot of exposure to something. For example, I was allergic to beef when I was younger, then tested negative for that allergy. I didn‚Äôt have beef for years and when I did I had a reaction. 

To answer your second question, most babies are tested for common allergies, and when they test positive for one, they‚Äôll be tested for more allergies. That‚Äôs how my parents found out about most of mine. The only other way I‚Äôve found out is by having a reaction to something new.

Sorry for the long answer! TLDR: Gaining allergies can happen at random but it‚Äôs less likely than losing them (in my experience) and babies are tested for common allergies when they‚Äôre young."

"Sorry I should have been more clear. I did actually make steps towards this fantasy as such, I obtained a large steak knife and had a plan to kill 2 people; my french / maths teacher who had abused me constantly for a prolonged time and a child in my year the same age as me who had threatened me with a knife and bullied me relentlessly the year leading up to this. I was in a mental turmoil so sever I didn't have control over my actions anymore but my last shred of sanity stopped me on the day I had planned it for. The real target was the teacher and I had learned when she took her bathroom break so I could wait for her. I was actually sitting in her lesson with the knife in my bag waiting. After the lesson I was shaking and crying hidden in a bathroom stall and someone asked me if I was ok.  That shingle act of compassion stopped me from doing something truly terrible that day."

"Okay so long story which is why I didnt want to explain it and I dont want to give too much away but idk try give as much detail as I can

My friend acted depressed and got sympathy, spilled all of his 'issues' because he trusts them' this deceives them into thinking that they can trust this person since they also trust them, the group had alot of people with anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses so they were already quite easy to manipulate.

While he was gaining trust from our main few targets I was hated, we pretended to have a feud and slowly became friends and he said that I'm not actually that bad but he understands if they dont want to talk to me. This gives them a feeling of choice and some of these people were very caring and wanted to learn the 'real me'

This slowly got me gaining trust of the other section fo this group, I managed to become friends with someone who cant trust men after past abuse and I'm the only man she trusts. I had a relationship with one if these people so they felt they had more of a reason to trust me. I broke up with them when I found an actual girl I liked.

We slowly gained trust I wont say every detail of every tactic but we eventually had the group trusting me as a good person to talk to for emotional support, near the end to make them feel bad I said I was angry at them as I like to push people away and I take other peoples issues to distract from my own

I faked cuts on my arm which even for me felt far but I got used to it and when someone pointed it out played the victim card and broke up a friendship because the girl wouldnt stop asking about the cuts

We started recording these convos where people would rant to us about other people, compiled all the backstabbing and released it on our group chat. People heard it and was so pissed off at each other, they were wondering who it was but the main thought was being pissed at each other and the majority if the convos people had forgotten they said

If anyone did know they didnt want to admit they said something they had said which theyd be doing by pointing us out

We were never caught, I'm looked at as the kid who lashed out on people to push them away because of trust issues (also I did some fake breakdowns and I was so happy with myself for how well I played them off) so whenever I lashed out I had an excuse, my friend near the end did the fairly popular tactic of faking depression and suicides that he never went through with

He also told people he was gay so girls felt more comtorble treating him as one of the girls. Not for sexual reasons just for trust

Feel free to ask anymore questions"

"Pentecostals are all screwed up because they claim they receive fresh revelations from God, even though the book of Revelations clearly says ""not to add to the words of this book"". My personal feelings are that they are in it for the extreme emotions and not really interested in following the Bible. For example, my wife before I met her got involved with them and they came to the house and told her to destroy her original artwork, which is quite good and some of her books. Like, way extreme over the top stuff."

"I mean, it depends on how sex is in relationships:

If your relationship is mostly just sex... you can stop if you want or you can just be FWB (basically being friends but having sex without romance nor guilt. Just a way to blow some steam and relax)

If you do sex first date then it's not really ok. Sex is recommended like 3 weeks after dating. It wouldn't destroy your relationship and will bring you closer together.

Also, wear a condom.

Have you ever masturbated tho?"

"Did you ever get mocked for your ideology? If so, how did you respond?"
"Also, have you ever considered that *SCIENCE DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ""GOD""?*

Religious people are the ones that came up with ""God"", not science so it's up to religious people to prove their god exists. Can't prove something that doesn't exist, right? 

**If I believed that your ghost dragon lived in my garage and you should pay me rent for Him staying there, and you asked me to prove it... should I say,** ***""Nope!! It's up to YOU to prove He doesn't exist and if you can't you owe me rent!""***

See how silly that sounds?

"Huh, it sounds like you have IASD (infant autism syndrome disorder). Anyways, I‚Äôm actually quite interested in how it‚Äôs like in Denmark. Like do you got to a special school, that‚Äôs better at handling people with special needs?"
"I gotcha, well I hope you have fun, as much as you can anyway."
I should have stated that I was planning to kill 2 specific people as you can read in a comment above. Nothing can reconcile the killing of innocents. However when you have been abused day to day without any escape at home or at school it doesn't take much to break a person.
Has it ever happened to you?
BDSM. I done it with my ex‚Äôs.
"I'm kinda disgusted by my question but what specific acts do these fucks do to kids?  And as a follow up, have you read about anything specifically that these fucks typically do?

&amp;#x200B;

I understand if you don't want to answer my question.  But I always wonder if it 's inappropriate touching over the clothes or way more fucked up than that.  I mean at some point this whole concept of adults/kids makes me want to vomit.  And I'm kinda scared to read your response.  Actually, can you just not answer."
"Getting in on this AMA as I'm bored, I'm the friend mentioned."

How old where you?? What charge did he have on the church??

Noses break really easy anyways and he needed it to get off.

Happy Cake Day!

Oh damn. I'm pretty sure being a cat burglar would be waaaay easier to make money as a lazy than being part of the deep web
"Oh god that sounds so horror. Do you have any idea why this happens? I mean, they're all just part of your brain but not many people actually hear voices. It's all in their subconsciousness. Also, have you tried reasoning with them?"

I am male and my partner is female. I don't want to go anywhere particular. Just travel around. I come from India. We are thinking traveling India for a couple months and then Poland. My partner comes from Poland btw.
at what age did you get addicted to porn?
Oh you‚Äôre right. No meat
"I do that all the time. I mean my ass fat, yeah,  but I don't pimp it out."
"Well put. They also act like I should change my rhetoric out of fear that I will drive people further into extemism. That's on the scum, not me. I'm not going to modify my behavior based on vague threats about how it affects a group actively pumping extreme violence into our beautiful world. 

We realistically have to reintegrate these people to a certain degree, but they will never be my friend and I will never accept them as a neighbor. I feel all the apologists in this thread are white, which raises the question would they forgive and forget an ISIS member (i.e. an Islamic supremacist)? Truly forgive, like being fine with an ""ex"" ISIS member living next to them? Even the radicalism of ISIS to an American white person is 1000 shades from goddamn American white supremacists to American people of color and American LGBTQ people and American civil rights acitivists."
"According to my mom, I‚Äôm a selective listener"
Because I want :p
"Glad you‚Äôre still around, mate. Do you feel as though your time in the mental hospital helped you at all?"
Almost all
I feel that Antarctica is often forgotten about and under appreciated and it would be cool to go there since not many people do. I also think it is really beautiful. It would be even better if I could manage to get to the actual South Pole some day haha. It would be quite an accomplishment to have been to the bottom of the earth.
"Was it worth it? If so why?

Are you currently working in a new job?"
"If you graduate from flight school, any idea what company you‚Äôre planning to fly with?

For me American Airlines nor AnA"
That‚Äôs quite a bit of time. Do you feel any closer to an answer?

Why everyone keep voting Putin as president of Russia?
"A [walmart sales manager position salary is about 60k](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Walmart-Sales-Manager-Salaries-E715_D_KO8,21.htm). That's not exactly rich. In California that's barely making ends meet; especially if you have a family to take care of."
You didn't kill her. It was an accident. Sorry that this happened to you.
"Well if you two plan to marry, Alabama is the answer. Like that Family Guy epidode where Peter wanted to marry his fat loser son because Lois' dad would give him his money when he dies."

"Food is around 3 days. I had an eating disorder off an on when I was 13-14 but I never went over 3 days. That one was a purposeful decision. Water was about 5 hours in the hot sun, or around 12 hours inside. After the sun I threw up twice and slept for three days, almost straight. After the time span for inside, I felt a bit dizzy and weak. Sleep is 41 hours. I was trying to conduct a study about the effects of not sleeping for a week in high school, but my mom shot that down real fast. Now, I can't afford to lose sleep because of school and job."
"Is it for tourism or to increase the value of a tourist city?
If it's just a transportation value, I think the car is higher."
