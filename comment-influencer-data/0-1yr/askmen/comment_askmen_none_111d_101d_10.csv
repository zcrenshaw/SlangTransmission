"Nah, she's just really, really hot."
"I hate to break it to you, but teachers and nurses are paid pretty well. 

The median (not average) pay for a teacher is [a little over $60,000/year](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/high-school-teachers.htm) while the median pay for an RN [is around $70,000/year](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/registered-nurse/salary). Both of those are more than twice as high as the [national median salary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States).

The problems are; unions sticking the best teachers in the districts that need the least help while sticking the shitty teachers in the worst districts, the focus on test results that bring in funding rather than a curriculum that promotes learning, the hiring explosion of administrators that act as middlemen and serve no purpose other than eating up funding. The United States has some of the funded schools in the world (even in ""poor"" areas) but still only manages middling scores on aptitude tests. It's undeniable evidence that throwing more money at the problem won't solve anything."

"Not ugly, but made me lose interest and eventually break up.

I'm a germophobe and this girl I was with was really pressuring me to kiss her, and would not stop. I really did want to show my affection, but not in a way that makes me insanely uncomfortable. Idk if it's my fault for that, I've been told I need to man up and just do it."
Yes but... you specifically addressed women as having that place in their SO’s lives... implying that it doesn’t go both ways...
Never understood why ppl ask these questions
There’s absolutely truth to stereotypes.
Yeah those are the biggest and reddest flags for me personally
"Okay it may not be right to share a story onstage but by having sex you are consenting to the person telling these details, you experience every day with this same pretense, something may happen and they will tell a story about me at any stage, including sex"
"I envy skinny men, could swear more women prefer the model type skellies than dadbods."
Conditional consent exists yes. Is there anything else you'd like help with or will be ok on your own from now?
Nonsense.
Wanting to get it over with without damaging his ego when it's not working for them.
it isn't for me but i guess it’s for the water falling in the cock and veins and obstructing the cum bit i really don't know
Pornhub... Do I really need to explain?
Suck my socks off
Unfortunately ye can't remain friends. Sorry man.
"Lol yeah true. I do love those good reads on the back of my Psycho Flakes! I *did* say it was my guess and obviously I was speaking generally here. So you think it should remain private? Why? Out of sheer respect for the spouse? Okay, well why would a Spouse feel violated here? If Men (Well everyone but mostly men) had no sexual drive, no hormonal knee jerk impulses, then wouldnt a lot more woman not care if info is shared between these sexual mutes? Like Docters speaking to each other for medical reasons."
