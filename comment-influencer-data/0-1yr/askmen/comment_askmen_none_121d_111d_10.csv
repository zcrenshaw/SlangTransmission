"We were never the weaker sex. Everyone gets scared sometimes. Awful things can happen to people, regardless of gender and often under the cover of night.  
Growing up always hearing that I shouldn't be alone outside, shouldn't walk in the dark.  Not being allowed to walk to the shops without my mum sending by brother with me, but he can go anywhere with out question. That shit is imprinted in my brain, and its hard to ignore when I'm walking myself home at the end of the night.  
It's not your fault, but it not my fault either. We live in a fucked up world. Both men and women can be scary, it's not the gender it's the individual and the way someone makes you feel in the moment.  All we can hope is we teach future children to think differently. It breaks my heart to hear my 6 year old neice tell me she can't do something or like something because it's ""for boys"".  Just like I was told when I was young.  I hope my nephew is never told he is wrong for liking pink and dressing up because it's ""for girls"".  Equality is so much more than who is ""the weaker sex"".  There are wrong doings for men and women everywhere, but however many years and years of oppression is hard to kick. I like to think we're moving in the right directions but there are still misogynists and misandrists everywhere.  There's no quick fix but you can educate yourself instead of misunderstanding snippets of information. Read about feminism and radical feminism and anti-feminism and come to your own conclusion."
"LMAO. Punk ass bitch. ""sTaRe ThEm DoWn unTiLL tHeY fUcK ofF."" The fuck you gonna do? Stare at them to death? You're fuckin weird dude. And not tough. Dork."
Jesus Christ. You honestly had to ask?
Cant do the beef curtains. Really turns me off.
It's not pathetic you're a degenerate who thinks asking for anything is weak. Holy shit go fuck yourself off to Nazi Germany where you wouldn't survive you moronic backwards sub 70 iq dumbass. Jesus christ imagine being this dense about helping yourself.
"Sure, just wondering if you've misread things and have over reacted. Be a shame to throw her away over a misunderstanding, but you were there so you'd know best. I was just curious."
"For most men they would love it.    


1. Sexual reasons obviously. The vagina is not like the Lincoln Tunnel.
2. Relationship wise they are dealing with a softer woman, it triggers something in men, that you are pure and innocent and in need of protection. 
3. Any man who tells you it doesn't matter is lying. Most normal men would never stick their dick in a vagina that gets traffic like a interstate. Only desperate men would."
"No, maybe I'm not getting my point across clearly. I think you should say you're dating multiple people (if you are/want to). *However*, I also think one should say it if they'd rather they both not date multiple people. That doesn't mean I weigh both things equally. I don't think anyone would find it a dealbreaker to be the only person someone is dating, so dating multiple people is definitely the ""more controversial"" option. So yes, I think people dating multiple people and not being upfront about that aren't being honest. 

**But**, if the monogamous dater feels very strongly about it, I also think they could (and should) start that conversation themselves. If the situation ends with two hurt people who are no longer dating because they both assumed something from the other which didn't turn out to be true, they're both (to some extent) responsible for that lack of communication. They both could have started that conversation and both didn't. And that means neither party is fully/solely to ""blame"" (as in, guilty) - both made a mistake and both could've avoided it."
"But you're a woman though, this question is referring to men.

Here, r/askwomen."
"Pull out your phone, open up maps and show her the marker on the map. Don’t break character for at least a minute.

When she starts getting a little annoyed be like “look you’re overthinking things. We are doing good, let’s just see where it goes”"
"THis is ask men, not ask children"
"don't even try, these people are completely out of touch with reality. 

they have no idea what a contradiction means and how something can not matter zero amount if you prefer something more then the other. it influences your decision on some level so it matters. u/MadSpaceYT think about what you're saying before you say it. you sound like a deranged female dog."
You sound single
"You don’t. You continue too be you, and the right person will come."
