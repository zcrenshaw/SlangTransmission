"Things haven’t changed much for me. Neither friends nor family hit me up for money. I dress like a slob. I only work when I want to but that has gotten me complacent. Women don’t throw themselves at me nor do I think they’re after my money. I travel a lot. I almost never cook for myself. I default to ordering in or picking up fast food. I love fancy restaurants. I still struggle to spend money on some things. And yet on other things, I’ll drop thousands of dollars without blinking. 

The biggest change for me has been motivation. I used to love working and now I’m struggling to be excited about anything. 

The biggest challenge is teaching my kids how to be self-sufficient. I had house cleaners and cancelled the service. We do our own house chores. I do my own yard work. I still want them to have pride in ownership and recognize that there isn’t a magical money tree. "
"My gf has full blown debates with me in her sleep. She'll *insist* she has an exam tomorrow and that she's going to fail and she's really stressed out, and her subconscious will not be convinced that she graduated in 2010.

EDIT: TIL that college can traumatise people on a deep level.

EDIT II: Y'all need counselling. "
"I dated a girl that'd always reach over and just hold onto my nuts. Not hard,  just kinda cupping them. 

I didn't mind.  It was kinda great."
"I only know my male friends have had sex because they have kids. It's never discussed. 

My wife, on the other hand discusses everything with her friends."
It means she's not interested in having a relationship with you. Waiting around almost never works. Go meet some other people.
"Night terrors. Like full on waking up with a scream from hell.

She had a very stressful job."
"In Michigan you get 10 cent to return cans after paying a deposit. Someone once told me, after finding out I saved my cans, I could never be man enough to take care of a woman if I worried about something as trivial as 10 cents. I don’t ever remember “worrying” about it but good talk. "
"Marriages? Never.

""Bro, you hit that?""

""Nice / Ah bummer""

"Had an ex who needed to sleep at least 10 hours a day to be functional. She's a light sleeper, but luckily, she falls asleep easily. However, everytime she wakes up, she would look shocked/surprised as if I was a stranger in bed with her and would sulk away for a few seconds,  before she can remember who I am. "
"That she was glad I was assaulted, because I’m a man and we should know what it feels like. "
Baby fever for me is already having several notebooks full of dad jokes and a fresh pair white leather New Balance shoes ready to go 
"My wife is a very intelligent and capable professional, but for some reason, she has seemingly no ability to make a mental map or recognize land marks. I have never seen anyone so easily lost while walking/driving. "
"When I was younger, I lived in the Dominican Republic. It was one of my classmates birthday at school. Her dad surprised her and the class with a gift. Turns out her dad was the manager of a very popular music group and he sent them to sing her Happy Birthday and do a meet and greet with the rest of her classmates. I loved this group, so I grabbed a poster of them (they came with posters) and had each member sign and collected all of their signatures. I was so happy on the bus ride home, me and my neighbor spoke all about it. I told her about the signatures and her tone changed. She only had some signatures not all. She proceeded to demand to give her the signatures because she is a woman. I told her no and then she said, ""Why would you keep that? Your a guy, you must be a girl or something?"" At this point the whole bus turned to us. I said, "" I'm not giving it up."" She kept coming back with similar comments, got her other friend to come at me with demeaning comments. Everyone on the bus thought I was a jerk for not giving them to her. Ended up standing my ground and I still have the signatures til this day. Can't a guy like music?

Edit: The group was Aventura"
"She'd go to sleep fully clothed (shirt, underwear, socks, maybe pajama pants) and wake up butt ass naked with just the left sock still on

Always the left sock

"My wife talks to me about nursing stuff.  I just go along with it.  

Wife - We need (medical jargon) for room 221.  He is in bad shape.  

Me -Um, you better get over there then!

Wife - I'm trying but my legs don't work!

Me - You're in a hospital, talk to a doctor."
"I don’t have a huge net worth, but I didn’t grow up with much money and now make 6 figures. 

I haven’t really lifestyle creeped. For me the biggest difference is I don’t have to think so much when I spend money on basic things. I used to get anxious over every little expenditure, so it’s been nice. 

Edit: To answer some of the questions-

I'm an options trader, so my base is low six figures, but it's a highly incentivized field so my end of year bonus can be anything from 50k to 500k or higher depending on the year. I've done well.

My hobbies are things that are mostly free or inexpensive (eg hiking). Like most American options traders I lived in Chicago but now I live on the west coast"
"A friend of mine was absolutely plastered one night. I showed up late to her party so I hadn't drank at all. She instantly grabs me and pulls me away to her room and keeps trying to have sex with me. I keep telling her no she's way too fucked up and it'd be wrong so then she proceeds to call me a pussy and other insulting names.

THEN she tells everyone at the party that I am a bitch because I won't fuck her. Then everyone joined in and mocked me all night because I wouldn't have sex with this clearly drunk girl... 

Yeah, fuck me for doing the right thing, right?"
"This thread is depressing. I'm sitting here thinking like, can I afford to get a strawberry milk or can I not.

I can not. "
"I usually let the girl sleep first cos I snore and it'll bug me if I kept her up.

Met a girl who insisted I sleep first but gave no reason, no matter how much I pressed her. I hid my wallet above the bathroom cabinet, because she was too short to reach, just in case.

I woke up with more clothes on, she somehow got a kick out of dressing me while I slept."
"I was once telling a coworker about how my ex-girlfriend was abusive to me. I thought we were kind of close and she was generally very sweet, but a bit ditzy. After telling her about how my ex would hit me, emotionally/mentally torture me, and threaten to kill herself so I wouldn't break up with her she looks me dead in the face and says ""Do you ever think that maybe you deserved it?""

And yes she was serious."
"I went to prison in 1998. I served 3 years. When I got out, all of my friends abandoned me. I literally had nobody but my parents. My sister's didn't want me being a bad influence on their children.

Initially I stayed with my parents and I got a job working with heavy equipment. I saved up and bought a car I saw on the side of the road. I fixed it up and sold it. I profited $2300. I thought to myself, ""That was fun! I'm going to do that again!"" so I did. That year I flipped 7 more cars and made about $13000 total. I used that money to petition the court to expunge my record on the basis that I was a combat veteran and a first time offender. I then took out a small loan to use as capital to start my own small used car lot. 

I got a floorplan which is a line of credit used to purchase cars. That was 8 years ago. I now have a net worth of around $4,000,000. I have branched out and have 3 dealerships and various real estate holdings. 

All of my old ""friends"" have reappeared after abandoning me and I am friendly towards them but that's about it. I surround myself with successful people who can help me in my journey. 

The one person who never left me was my wife who I met within days of being released. Everyone thought she had lost her mind by going out with an ex con. Her friends abandoned her for it. Her sister disowned her. She has never wavered. Not one time. Together, we went from poor to wealthy and she has believed in me 100%. We rarely socialize with friends because we would rather spend our time together. "
"Once went out with a girl who slept with the lights on, not like a nightlight or anything but with the all the big lights on."
"That I can think of, I’ve only talked about it once to one of my friends who was really unhappy with his current sexual relationship but thought it was normal, so I was basically letting him know that he deserves to have his needs met. 

The people I know that talk explicitly about their wives in bed are pretty trashy. Seems like the more that a guy actually respects his wife, the less he says about their sex life"
"She is clumsy until she simply reacts.

Like, if I throw a ball to her by surprise, 99% of the time she'll catch it.

But if she knows it's coming, she drops it.

"
"When my wife had a miscarriage and was being prepped for surgery (D&amp;E), the nurse said to her ""He's had his fun. It's us women who suffer."""
You may have it also.
"When I declined to “come to her place”after a date (I didn’t want to meet her kid for the first time that way) she told me, “you must be a homo.”
This from an educated lawyer. "
"My wife is kickass mom, has boundless patience with our kids, graduated 3rd in her class in high school, cum laude in college, and she currently works as a structural engineer with her PE.  She has managed to make herself a critical part of every company she's worked for within 6 months of starting there.

She drives like she's drunk.  Stone cold sober, not distracted by her phone, no one else in the car, no excuses at all.  She's just a fucking awful driver."
"My wife waves her arms in the air a little. But not in a haphazard way - more of an elegant, ""flowing"" kind of motion, almost like she's conducting an orchestra in slow motion. And she'll stroke her arms with her fingertips while she does it. It was actually a little creepy the first few times I saw it. 

I also saw my daughter do this while sleep in her crib once or twice. Less creepy, more cute with little toddler arms.

Edit: this is way more common than I thought"
Your ED makes you 1/2 a person
Good parenting. 
"As an aside: sometimes when women with baby fever see a kid and say “my ovaries are tingling,” no one bats an eye, but if you see a kid and say “my testicles are tingling...”"
"I’m in the 98th percentile for earnings for my age group. So I am the 2% I guess. Lifestyle inflation is so real. Before, I would balk at paying $50 for shoes. Now a $150 pair is basically nothing. It’s really easy to spend money. You need to stay vigilant regardless of how much you make "

Nope and neither do any of my friends. That's something I've noticed girls tend to do especially in the beginning of the relationship and it's pretty irratating to say the least.

"Ex of mine would bring her parrot on a perch and place her on the night stand. This was weird but fine until one night she waved her arm in the middle of the night hitting the bird off the perch. I awoke to an screeching parrot blindly flying in the room and crashing into the wall. 

Edit: There was also a time with the same Ex and Parrot where we were playing hide the wiener and some pretty aggressive noises were being made. On the precipice of climax, said parrot finally had enough and flew and attacked my back and clawed and bit me a few times. I still finished. "

"This.

She said no. It doesn't matter why. It doesn't matter if you're not her type. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. There are plenty of girls on the planet that aren't your type either.

It happens to literally everyone. Go find someone who is compatible with you. "
Watching her try and catch things tossed to her is one of the simplest pleasures in life. 
"My girlfriend often gets “sleep drunk” and so she’ll wake up and start having a full blown conversation with me but about things that make no sense at all. And then she’d just COMPLETELY FORGET IN THE MORNING. 

For example “Did you forget to walk the hedgehog?” 
#WHAT HEDGEHOG?? ... WALK IT?????

"You'd never understand my child's death because you're not a mother.

"I wouldn't call it baby fever, but there are definitely moments where I'll see a young family with kids and wish I had that. "
Good parenting but you should also try to shake that eating out habit for the same reason. Teaching your kids to cook is one of the most self sufficient things you can teach. 
"""You can't be depressed you look completely normal so stop bullshitting, you're a guy anyway"""
"I’ll assume this is a college setting. Here is what I do and it works pretty well.

Do all assignments as soon as you get them. I don’t care when they are due. I do papers/homework/projects weeks before my classmates and it frees up so much time to study come exam time. Also helps with stress

Attend every class. People who flunk out are always the ones who are consistently late/ don’t go to class. 

When it comes to actual studying, make a cheat sheet for the exam. Even if one isnt allowed on the exam, the process of writing out the mist important things and studying them helps a lot.

Do not stay up late studying the night before. If you have to cancel plans then do so, and if you are behind then go to bed early and get up early to study a little more.

Finally make friends with the driven people in your class. Not the smart ones who are geniuses, but the ones who put in work consistently, always attend class and get good grades. Get in study groups with them and you will help each other strive."
Ah kids... The ol' sex trophy.
"My GF still sleeps with a stuffed animal every night.  

**Edit re: 'that's not weird'**

It's more that I didn't expect it. I didn't know until our 5th date when she spent the night at my place for the first time. She hit me with the 'so, I have to tell you something weird...' and it was about her toy, Froggy. It's a Build a Bear frog that her younger sister (who is 15 years younger than my GF) got for her years ago.

It has become a fixture and has been present for every single night we've spent together, including when we travel. I've gone from thinking it's odd to embracing it. I bought myself a stuffed bear about a year ago and now they sit in our respective sleeping positions on the bed every day."
"I have literally never commented on a girls sexual activities with anyone but her.

I've worked in a factory with enough women to know this is not true in reverse though, an awful lot of the time."
"I’m black and I had a white woman ask me “Do you like to dance?” and I said “no, not really” then she replied with “oh, I bet you can sing really well” I replied “mmm, not really.”  She closes it off with “you don’t sing and you don’t dance? What kind of a black man are you?” ... I haven’t talked to her since. ... "
"Jesus man, sorry to hear that. My best friend got taken advantage of while he was passed out drunk by a gay co-worker (gave him a bj), while two females were in the same room egging him on. As if it wasn’t traumatic enough for him, the aftermath was way worse. They went and told everyone he worked with that it wasn’t rape because he got a boner while he was unconscious, and that meant he must have enjoyed it, and all of his coworkers jumped on board. Still makes me livid to think about. This was two years ago and he still loses sleep over it, not to mention I’ve never seen him have more than two beers after that happened. Just a complete betrayal of trust. "
"I've always wanted kids. Recently my best friend from high school announced he and and his wife are having a baby, and I got mad jealous.

Also something happened a few weeks ago that didn't help. I'm an EMT and we responded to a call for a 2 year old who had a febrile seizure. We got to the hospital and when I picked him up out of the carseat, he wrapped his arms around me and buried his head in my shoulder. I figured he was one of those kids who doesn't mind strangers but his grandma said ""I don't know what you did, but he's normally not like this with strangers so he must like you or something."" I just melted."
"I have long hair and a woman on the bus asked if my boyfriend holds my hair when he’s fucking me from behind.

Funny now that I say it, kind of surprised when I heard her say it."

No.  This is something women think because *they* do it.  
*tries to forget about only having $30 for the week*
I think she has narcolepsy.
I'm so sorry. That woman is in the wrong profession. 
i had a friend that had to break up with his girlfriend because she would sleep only in the starfish position (X &lt;—just like that) ON TOP OF HIM every single night. She would get incredibly angry when he tried to tell her that it was a NO and his entire body would be asleep and tingly upon waking up
"""You're a guy, I expect you to pay for me."" nah, i'm good. "
"I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'm good at my job, but I don't like it. The only reason I work is because I need money to pay for food and bills."
"My girlfriend tends to fall asleep all over the house. She’ll go do something and won’t come back and when I investigate I find her asleep somewhere. That might sounds pretty normal, but the best part is that when I try to get/wake her up to get up to bed she’ll make up a random excuse why she can’t go. 

The best one so far was when we were watching a friends house while they were on vacation. I try to wake her up and she goes “no no I can’t. Benny (the dog) is doing math.” I really need to start writing all the things she says down because they’re hilarious and she never remembers any of it 

[edit]-after reviewing the comments I feel like I should correct my original post. The only times this occurs is at night after a very long day. Usually she falls asleep while snuggling one of the animals at either of our houses. She doesn’t display any other symptoms of narcolepsy, but I appreciate the concern and should’ve worded my post better "
This one girl liked it when I slept on top of her. I would call it a kink more than a sleep habit.

"My ex, a petite thing half my size, used to rip out a massive fart whenever she fell asleep. 

It might seem disgusting, but it was the green light for me to roll over and sleep more comfortably.

Edit: I didn't tell her she did that before we were dating for two years. She didn't believe me so obviously my post here must be a lie."
"&gt;Met a girl who insisted I sleep first but gave no reason.

She just needed to fart, dude.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why, if it seems like I'm kicking you out of my house quickly after the first cup of morning coffee, I definitely am. I need to poooooo!"
Do you remember what it was like being that age? I remember thinking it was cool to have someone that would play with me and take me places because its so beautiful to think back and remember childhood memories. You can be apart of that broskie
"My wife will wake up thinking someone is in the room or at the foot of her bed. It will take her about 2-3 minutes to snap out of it. These episodes happen like 4-5 times a year.

I think it's just a recurring dream that causes her to wake up before she's fully awake yet. 

"
"My wife used to hold in her farts all day at work and at home around me. What she didn’t realize was the second she’d fall asleep at night, she’d start letting these long and low rumbling farts go. At first I thought it was hilarious, then it just became part of my bedtime routine. “Well that’s her third fart, better turn off the tv and get some sleep.” I never told her about it because it didn’t bother me and I didn’t want to embarrass her. Then she was having some issues sleeping, so she download this app that would track your sleep cycles. The app has a feature that records audio disturbances, be it a siren, a cough, or you guessed it, a fart. The first time she listened to the recording she asked if she would fart in her sleep. I told her I never heard her fart in her sleep and that it must be me. She went on believing I was sleep farter for three and a half weeks until she went on a work trip and continued using the app....

Edit 1: this blew up, thanks for the hardware!

Edit 2: now that the cat is out of the bag, she has become a little less shy about farting in front of me. That said, I hear or smell her fart maybe once a month while she’s awake. She continues to toot like a tugboat in her sleep. "
"If it's not yes, it's a no. Move on"
"Maybe not directly related to sleep, but an ex of mine used to eat in my bed. Chips, cookies, anything crumbly was just all over every time I got in.

Ain't fun cleaning Fritos outta your ass crack."
"Finally something I can contribute to. I have a brother who is 18 years younger than me. We started off as a great team, but I was only in town a few weeks a year because I was in the military. He grew up loving to go to the airport because that meant that I was coming home. When I got out of the Marines in 2006 he was two years old. So I have been around a while now. First thing I had to learn was I wasn't his parent. My mom would often threaten him that if he didn't act right she would call me. Do not allow this to happen. It will eventually strain your relationship with her. 

  
Also my family is very poor. Due to some unfortunate circumstances and poor money management in general. I would be in the same boat if I hadn't gone in the military and gotten to go to college on the GI Bill. So I have a decent job and a nice place to live. I try to make sure he has time away from the hectic life he lives with my parents. I try to motivate him to work hard in school and prepare for the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also take him to do things to show him that the world is larger then his playstation, and youtube. I took him to florida with my soon to be wife to show him that vacations can happen and are for relaxing not just spending money. I take him to a nice barbershop to show him you get what you pay for when you deal with the service industry. I try to give him as much of my time as possible. 

  
He started playing football this year and wasn't getting much playtime or attention from the coaches. I worked with him on the weekends and helped him boost his PT. I make time to go and cheer at his football games. Sometimes I am the only one in the stands for a JV game. I seen him get his first tackle for a loss and his first sack. 

  
So take it from someone who is living it.  

* Make time for her.
* Take an interest in her hobbies.
* Respect her and make sure she knows you are a safe place
* Never lie to her.
* Give her the the room to grow and make mistakes. 
* Show her how to be a great person so she can work off a good example. 
* Spoil her now and then .
* Make time for just the two of you.
* Get on her level when you talk to her.

"My old roommate who had masters in gender studies and worked in academia called me down to tell me about a problem we had with the kitchen sink.

"I inherited enough as a 21 year old that I would never have to work but I grew up middle class. I don't tell people, but I don't go to great lengths to hide it either so my close friends know I have money, but not just how much. I continued the career path I was on and don't intend to give it up. I'd probably go stir crazy without it. I live well beyond the means of my peers though.

I didn't expect it to be so awkward with other people who don't have as much. I have friends who are working full time for $60k which is less than I pay in tax each year. In a group setting, people will talk about a financial problem they have, their student debt or similar and expect that I can relate. I don't want to make them embarrassed or unhappy so I just continue the conversation without sharing my experience. Sometimes people talk about leasing a new car that I don't think they can afford or having just bought the latest iPhone but I don't feel I can say anything or it might sound condescending. I can see why the rich are friends with the rich, there's a freedom to talk about your problems without judgement. Being anonymous online lets me talk about it in a sort of [/r/offmychest](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest) manner.

I once met someone from work's boyfriend who was bragging about his high paying job. It happened not too long after I inherited the money so I still hadn't told anyone and wasn't sure if I should. His attitude was so unattractive that it set me on the path of not telling people, even though I don't think I'd be as braggadocios as he was.

Edit because I thought of something else:

When I was younger I thought if I was a rich old man a trophy wife would be perfect. Now that I'm 30 I can't think of anything worse. I have encountered women who expected me to be a sugar daddy because I have the means to and it turned me off immensely. It made me feel devalued as a person, as if I was an ATM but instead of putting her card in she spends some time with me. Now I always hide my wealth from dates until we are a few months in."

"My wife always accuses me of being RG color blind because I have trouble distinguishing them sometimes. It's totally true that I am but years back before we were married I turned it into a joke and said she was the one who was color blind.

So we're watching this video and the narrator gets to this one picture and asks what you can see. She says she can see a boat. Then the narrator says ""congratulations if you can see a boat you may be blue-yellow colorblind"" and I just bust up and start laughing my ass off!  So she slams the lap top closed and yells out, ""I'm not colorblind! I just already watched the video before I showed it to you! I knew what it was already!"" which made me laugh even harder. She got so mad and frustrated at me she grabbed all her stuff in a huff and left my apartment. She wouldn't talk to me until the next day. It still makes me laugh and still haven't conceded that I actually have mild color blindness."

"My wife had problems waking up to her alarm, so her boss gave her this nightmarish alarm clock that rang at like 100+ decibels, just on the verge of permanent ear damage, and came with a giant pod that looks like a smoke alarm that you put in between your mattress and box springs.  This fucking thing vibrated the bed for you.

So every morning for a while I had to wake up like it was the end of the goddamn world.  I'd be clinging to the ceiling fan like a cartoon cat and my wife would just sort of groggily lazily swing her legs around to the floor.

"I once wore a mankini to the last day of a three-day music festival. I copped a few ass slaps in the crowd, which I was fine with, it's a bit of a novelty blah blah, but when I went to wait in line at the toilets with my girlfriend (who was fine with the whole mankini thing, bless her), I copped one really over-the-top slap from a girl behind me. I turned around as said ""Are you right?"" and she said ""Well, you were asking for it."" 

Told her to fuck right off, and imagine what would he reaction be if I'd done/said the same to her."

"Not wealthy (yet), but one of my best highschool friends has really made it. He once said that he did not expect that the best thing of doing well is having a cleaner that does his shirts/laundry for him. 

By that metric, I am wealthy, too.

Background: he is not a billionaire, but in the tens of millions  I would guess. Most people don't realize how wealthy he is (and frankly I also don't know exactly), because he keeps a low profile and only ocasionally goes on spending a lot of money with the circle of friends that have a lot of money themselves and wont judge. E.g. he has rented a very nice yacht in the carabean once. Mostly, he spends the money he earns with his company on rental property, which is - in fact - diversifying his investment. All the stuff he has is nice, but reasonable.

I like that he hasn't changed. I also understand that people around him will judge him so he is forced to find a circle of friends that wont judge. We rarely talk about money. He is being smart and kind about it. The only time I notice that we have fundamentally diffrent problems is when he mentions things that are out of my depth, like the value of a good lawyer or things like that. 

While I am doing well enough to afford most things, he never puts me in a position where doing something with him would be a serious expense for me. When we go skiing with friends we still rent at reasonble prices, like one or two categories up from when we were younger (and neither of us were well off); but not a top of the line chalet.

"An ex of mine loved it when the room was hot as fuck and she insisted on having the blanket over her. She also needed ZERO noise. I hate both of those things. I love it when it's cold with white noise in the background. We somehow slept fine together but I remember waking up with her on top of me, sweating bullets. I had to peel her off of me. She was cool tho.

"As a non-dad (no kids, no desire for kids), it wasn't a thing. 

As a pre-dad (awaiting first born), it was nervousness and wondering if I'd be a good dad, if I was ready, etc. The decision to even have a kid, while partly mine, was due more to the fact that I married someone who I knew wanted a family, and I wanted her to be happy. I realized after a while that I was waiting to be ""ready,"" and there's no way to ever be ready to be a parent - you just do it and figure it out.

As a dad with two kids now (youngest turning 1 tomorrow, eldest is nearing 3), I love babies and would have them forever if I had all the time and money in the world."

"I was jumped and robbed while delivering pizza when I was younger. It was pretty bad. I remember the police telling me immediately after that I would need to get counselling or see a therapist. I thought I was so tough, that no way I was fine and that it wouldn't affect me. I was wrong. I would definitely recommend seeing a specialist just to talk to them and help you get over such a traumatic event. I spent years silently suffering and even developed a bit of a drug problem partly because of that traumatic experience. Although I'm better now, and my life regained traction, I would recommend against you having to suffer in the same ways I did. Get help, talk to people. You'll be okay. You are not alone."

This girl I used to date believed in magic and had to cast a protective spell over her bedroom before we went to sleep.

She's a strange woman, but I sure do love her.

"I’m a serial entrepreneur, have many investments, and have an income in the top 2%. I also currently live as though I am middle class, started off as a blue-collar worker, and grew up close to the poverty line. I’m also a college dropout. Here are a few things I did not expect about being wealthy:

1. I paid very little in taxes when I first started working (since my income was so low). My tax burden is now more than many of my friends make in salary per year. I can sort of see why wealthy people are so preoccupied with tax law.

2. Certain purchases I no longer think about price. Especially food. I grew up ordering food at a restaurant by looking first at price. Now I order whatever I want.

3. Having money is great, but some things became significantly more complex. Juggling businesses, keeping track of investments, staying on top of things like estate planning, being diligent about privacy and security, and all of the people and businesses that want to sell you something.

4. To add to #3, I have more hobbies now too. Having money has allowed me to afford certain hobbies that were just too expensive when I was younger. This is great on one hand, but it’s also sort of frustrating that I will never have the time or lifespan to master much of any of them.

5. I did not expect the assumption that many people have about my intelligence. Others who know of my wealth tend to hang on my words and opinions as if they are more profound than theirs or others, even if the topic has nothing to do with areas I’m knowledgeable in.

6. As I started making more money, I had prepared myself with the assumption that other wealthy people were standoffish, self-centered, and highly materialistic. I was surprised to find that many are highly emotionally intelligent, empathetic to others - especially the less fortunate, very approachable, and really fun to be around.

7. Because of my upbringing, I had a lot of family and friends who continually questioned and criticized the effort I put into trying to grow my businesses. They were always very pessimistic that my time would turn into anything material. Had I not aligned with certain people and philosophies that changed my mentality, I would never have reached escape velocity.

8. Reaching normalcy after “leveling up” comes very quickly. It’s exciting to make more money, but the excitement wears off quickly, especially with material possessions. The things I thought would make me happier, didn’t exactly. The things that do are more experiential, some of them easily attainable without wealth. I used to love fishing before I became wealthy and still do. I now wish I had more time for it.

9. I discovered that it doesn’t take extensive individual intelligence to become wealthy. While it helps to understand certain things, I’ve gotten farther with persistence, resourcefulness, improvisation, and covering my weaknesses by aligning with others who are more intelligent than me."
"Strong this. My 96th Percentile mother, and 97th percentile Cousin, consider themselves ""normal americans"" solely because of lifestyle creep. They were utterly shocked when I looked up their salaries and what they meant. Didn't believe me until I found a few sources.

Yeah and women aren't raped if they orgasm. See how it doesn't work? Of course guys get hard during rape it is a natural response to sexual things it doesn't mean we like something. I can't just flip a switch and get a boner. People like this give me headaches.

She also wakes herself up. I’ll be chillin in bed or whatevs, and she just starts to get up. “What are you doing?” I’ll ask. “The baby’s waking up.” Then I look over at the baby monitor and there’s baby, snoozing away like babies do, no green light for any noise or anything. Then, without fail, the baby fucking wakes up. "
"Nope, it's a common misconception. I'm 36 and have never discussed my partner's performance in bed and neither have any of my friends.

He scored two tickets to the They Might Be Giants show at a local club and when I told her about it she said ""What about me, why didn't you get me a ticket."" 

""Well, because I didn't buy them.""

""So, you could have got me one and called your sister to watch the kids so I could go too.""

""Fine fuck it, I'll tell him I can't go then.""

She’s hit walls, trash cans, kids bikes, bricks, if it’s been in the garage and isn’t my truck (because somehow that thankfully escaped the onslaught) she has hit it. I can’t get her to stop. She just gets angry stubborn and I know I’m fighting a loosing battle. Overall, she’s a fantastic driver; one accident in the last 16 years of her driving and it was when we were juniors in high school. Literally nothing her fault or otherwise since. Can’t back out of the fucking garage like a sane person to save her goddamn life. I used to watch her leave in the morning and wave...and it’s gotten so bad I wave once, shut the door, go inside and wait for the thuds.

This is probably gonna get buried but it’s perfectly in line. Unlike my wife’s ability to back straight out of the fucking garage."
"My girlfriend at the time was nearly asleep and babbling, and said ""I bet you'd hit me. If I made you mad enough.""

I was physically abused for most of my childhood, and I'm a very calm person due to wanting to be nothing like the people that abused me. I couldn't sleep. I kept wondering what I'd done to make her think that, I felt wrong and vile and like i was just as bad as anyone who would hit someone they claim to love, even though I hadn't done anything. 

I brought it up when she woke up and she didn't remember saying it. And didn't get why it bothered me so much. "
"I once had a girlfriend that slept in the fetal position... but not on her side.  Image sleeping on your stomach, but your knees tucked up to your chest.  She would have her head positioned in line with her body, but with a downward angle so the top of her head was on the pillow and chin sort of between her knees.

"Well, it depends on how large your breasts are and how far away he is from you.  Since you haven't given a lot of information I'll have to make some assumptions.

Let's assume you have medium-sized breasts, somewhere around a C-cup.  They'd weigh roughly 500g each, so 1kg for the pair of them (assuming you have two breasts).

Let's assume you're standing 1m apart during a conversation.

And finally, an average human eye weighs around 7.5g, so 15g for the pair, assuming your boyfriend has two eyes.

Now we can use the equation F = (G x m1 x m2)/r^2 to determine the gravitation pull of your boobs on your boyfriend's eyes.  Plugging the numbers in, we come up with a gravitational force of ~1x10^-12 newtons.

So I think we can pretty conclusively say that this behavior is not caused by gravity, and must have another explanation."
I also am interested in seeing a picture of this house duck. 
I don't understand how some people feel that it's socially acceptable or that they're entitled to just...  touch other people :(

"I like my BF to lay on me. He’s 180lbs to my 148lbs. It’s a little weird thing we will do. I will go up and say “squish?” And he just knows it’s time to lay on me LOL. It’s a huge comfort thing for me, not sexual. I feel really safe and just weighed down. Vv nice. "
Kept trying to share my pillow. Super annoying. There are two pillows. Move!
Indeed. I'm pretty sure it didn't go any further because two other women jumped in to berate this person and tell her to leave my kid alone after I threatened to kill her on the spot if she didn't let go immediately. (My threat had no effect at all and I was mentally preparing to follow through when the other women jumped in)

"I once had a gf who woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me in a whisper that there was a burglar in our bedroom. I whispered back ""where?"" freaking the fuck out, obviously, and she said ""there"", and vaguely pointed to the corner. I looked but couldn't see anyone, which wasn't surprising because it was pitch black in the room. 

So while i'm looking she says ""you know who he is, don't you?"" and I said ""no"", and she says ""spaghetti!"" and then rolls over and goes back to sleep. It was literally 20 min before my heart stopped racing, and prob an hour before i could go back to sleep. "

Still worry about money. I don’t think twice when spending money on basic essentials (groceries, bills, and etc). 


I find myself traveling out of the country more often. When I was younger, I would never think that was going to be possibility for me. I go to the gym, work and keep my house clean. I play pc games and still see friends. I go out and spend money on occasion. But I think stay home, pc games, and cooking my own food is what keeps my cost of living down therefore saving more money on other stuff "
"My Ex once said, ""All my Girl friends are into these buff Gym dudes, and i'm not into that"".

The biggest thing is the lack of stress over money. Being able to sleep without worrying how to pay for everything. 

When I started working as a kid I would will myself through my shift by focusing on the nickels I got each minute. Now almost 20 years later I don’t give a second thought to the dollars pouring in each minute... I don’t work to make money, I work to keep the job that’s giving me all this money. "

She's amazing with everything else, but ask her to get you anywhere from our apartment except work, which is literally right down the street, we don't even have to turn onto another road, and she'll have you make at least one wrong turn and not realize it until 5 minutes later"

One time, my college GF was on top riding me and then she pulled the covers over me and lays on top of me, teasing that she's gonna dutch oven me. I was playing along and we're all giggling.

She couldn't wait to get the covers off in time. "

I take the cat and the kids to the cottage for the summer and my husband stays home during the week to work, he says he has a hard time falling asleep without the super loud purring next to his ear. He might miss me too, let’s assume he does. "

"Based on my experience:

For the most part, a vagina is a vagina. There isn't much variance in terms of how they ""feel.""

Finding women who take a more active role in bed is pretty rare. Most of you have to be led into pretty much everything.

Most of you have some physical quirk that you're really self-conscious about. Nobody on earth pays more attention to that quirk than you do.

The faces you all make when you orgasm are, well... Strangely similar. It's not a goofy face or anything. I just think it's this involuntary thing we all do in one way or another.

A lot of you say ""I never do something like this."" Even while you are doing the exact thing you say you never do. We know it's bullshit. You don't have to say that.

Virtually every single one of you has a ""freak streak"" that you'll let loose when you find the guy who really does it for you.

For those who can orgasm vaginally - you on top + grinding back and forth or guy from behind at a slightly elevated angle seems to be the most consistent way of getting you there. I don't know if that's due to women's preference or just the shape of my dick, to be honest.

You're down for almost anything so long as you don't feel like a ""slut"" for doing it.

It could be said that a lot of men don't know what they're doing when it comes to sex. Trust me, women are just as clueless. This isn't a failing on anyone's part, really. It's just a consequence of having no first-hand experience with actually having a penis or vagina. The only failing is not being able to truly communicate what gets you going. That can be like pulling teeth sometimes.

A pretty striking majority of you really are into being man-handled.

You're all so... Soft. You're like warm velvet. All of you. I don't know how you do it.

Almost everyone pussy farts at one time or another. Don't sweat it.

"How the fuck do you shit on your dick?? Is your dick so long it just sits in the toilet water and occasionally has a turd bump it? Is your asshole configured so that it aims shit at the back of your dick? 

The answer is zero for me. "
"You run out of things to buy then get bummed out about it.  Then, once you are feeling down about not having anything to buy you realise that buying things was a false thrill.  Buying things wasn’t making you happy, it was distracting you.  You only kept buying things because you want the novel feeling to last.  It always fades to neutral.  Then you are left with the stress of things you no longer care about.  Once you reach that point you realise that experiences are better than things.  You go through a phase of buying experiences.  Then you run out of them too (and get bummed out about it).  You then start down a path of doing things for others.  Philanthropy never gets old and (Once your family is taken care of) it is the most satisfying thing your wealth can give you."

I went for my first massage ever the other with my partner. Her treat for our anniversary. Iday didn't really know what to expect but tried to relax and get in the mindset. Now the two ladies giving us a couples massage were both Scottish, very friendly and very calming regarding me being new to this. Anyway, just as I had relaxed, got on the table and had my face in the hole I looked down and saw a reflection of a stag picture on the wall. All of a sudden I'm reminded of an old UK TV advert and song by Hoots Mon and ""There's a moose loose aboot this hoose"" is in my head and I erupt in stiffled sniggering as I'm thinking ""there's a masseuse loose aboot this hoose"". 

I tried so hard to keep it in and when asked if okay had to say I'm just nervous instead of repeating what would be a likely racist comment to the kind woman. 

On the plus side. I discovered leg massages are really nice. "
"I've been what's considered pretty ""upper-class"" for the last few years. 

High income, no taxes, and living in the developing world with a much lower cost of living. Let's just say if I was on the west coast of the US, I would need to earn ~300k+ to live like I've been living.

Things I've learned:

It's hard to trust women now. I always think they only want to be with me for money. Especially, in this part of the world.


I've become _very_ lazy. Wash some clothes? Hell no. Cook food? meh. I also notice I don't clean up after myself now. Opps I'm just used to someone else doing that.


I've become pretty out of touch with how most people live, and the struggles they go through.


People back home don't seem to talk to me now. Old friends and extended family. If they do, friends will drop a lot of snarky comments. I don't know if it's maybe jealousy? We're so different? My dad certainly makes a lot of snarky comments. (Just buy this house. Can I have $10k?)


I think about money management a lot. I have spreadsheets. I talk to friends a lot about investment opportunities, etc.


I notice I seem to have a lot more friends and acquaintances who are equally well to do. Some a lot more well to do than me.

"I got sexually assaulted when I went out to a gay club with my friends.  One of them was a girl who just said, ""now you know what women go through.""  Zero pity.  I was like, ""just because women go through it doesn't mean it's ok when I go through it."""

I obliged and when I asked about it later she said she showed all her friends because they were talking about it. This was a 3-4 year relationship at that point, was very pissed"
"I’ve fallen into this a lot. I’ll see something/read a text that doesn’t need an immediate response and I don’t want to take the time to respond so I don’t but I know what my answer will be. Then two hours later I realize the person never responded to the text I never sent and I’ll check to see if my text went through only to see that I never sent anything. It’s nothing personal, I do it to family, friends, SOs. Sometimes I just don’t feel like responding right then. "
"My ex, first night I ever saw her sleep, her body fucking twitched, like a convulsion. I woke her up, thought she was having some seizure or dying or whatever. Nah. It just happens to her. Took me a long time to get used to that.

This is funny to me because I navigate almost 100% off of some sort of landmark. If someone were to tell me directions by travel distance and turns I'd be confused. But If they were to tell me the amount of intersections to go through and what stores to pass/look for I would be very comfortable finding my way. 
"I still deal with taxes a lot. I did while I was building my wealth but even more now as a practically retired young person.

I don’t typically flaunt my wealth but buy things because I want the fun and utility of something. For example I bought a BMW sports car a few years ago when I could have easily bought a new Ferrari. I bought the car for fun driving experiences not to show off. Ferrari actually intimidates me because it is just so showy.

I get treated very average by most people when out but I am probably the wealthiest person in the place - sometimes it makes me chuckle in some situations - for example when some guy is acting all fancy over something mediocre. When people from my industry know my wealth and meet me then it can often be uncomfortable as they are a little too eager to please. I always try to be as down to earth as possible.

I still do some work but only 2-3 hours per week - I do it for fun and it also makes the question “what do you do?” easier to answer.  People don’t really want to hear that you are retired at 40. :)"

Google prefers you to ask it questions in shorthand form for best results, she will ask it very specific questions that usually ends up with no results.

"I never understood this. When I go on first dates I usually pay my half. If we continue seeing each other and he offers to pay for dinner, I let him. I then will cover movies or the next date.

Growing up, if I wanted money I earned it. When I was little I could wax his tool boxes or organize his tools and earn a new video game. As I got older the jobs got tougher. By the time I finished highschool I was completely profeceint in body work. 

I'll always be greatful my dad made me earn things. All my friends were given brand new cars when they were 16 (very wealthy community) I got a beat up '92 Plymouth acclaim, because that's all I could afford with what I had saved. I loved that fucking car.

I look at my friends from childhood. Most of them struggle with daily tasks and can't survive without a paycheck from their parents. Most have depression and zero pride. My dad did right by me and my sister. Oh and my little sister is a journeyman welder. "
"I would say, don’t act like a parent. If you act like a parent, then in her head you’re just the same kind of option available for her to open up to. And if she doesn’t want to open up to her parents about certain issues, she won’t want to open up to you. 

If you can be someone less judgemental or authoritative, she will feel like she has more people she can come to with her problems. And that’s very important and girls - especially, nowadays with social media - go through a lot of stress in their teen years. "

"It wasn't said to me..me and my wife over heard some younger college couple arguing while getting groceries (everyone in the small grocery store could hear them) well we just so happened to park a few cars down from them...as we are loading up she says ""try and tell someone that I hit you and I'll say you are abusing me"" well let's just say I feel Soo bad for that guy.."

"I’m in social work and I love helping people. I would absolutely love to keep helping people but on my terms and convenience, and have enough money to comfortably support myself without it relying on a certain number of hours you have to put in. Social work jobs don’t typically pay well, and over time they really start to wear you down."
That's as fucked up as trying to claim a female rape victim enjoyed it because she got wet. 
You're too good for her.
"“What’s wrong with you is your dick broken?” after I rejected a girl for sex. She couldn’t fathom being rejected 


“Get me a woman” while I worked in retail. She said that to me after I told her we don’t carry another brands items in our store and she refused to believe me. "
"Completely off topic, but sort of parallel in terms of reporting medical professionals behavior:

I had a friend on fb just post something the other day (she’s a nurse) about how she was coming in shift and overheard two nurses coming off shift talking about how a certain patient was a DNR (do not resuscitate). My friend was concerned because she knew the patient personally so she checked their chart to discover that there was NOT, if fact a DNR on this person. 

What’s worse, she had to go over multiple heads in order to rectify the mistake because none of the head nurses or doctors would listen, or they didn’t care. 

Right after the mistake was corrected by some higher up, the patient coded and ended up being revived. 

If she hadn’t advocated for them, they would have for sure let them die. 

Scary, fucking. Shit. "
Man up.
"Read twice, then chuckled."
I've powered through so many leg cramps it's probably one of my kinks now

You mean *hopefully*
"Actually I was a pushover and just apologized anyway, but we broke up soon after for geological reasons. 
Edit: TIFU by saying geological instead of geographical"
"Im in the top 3-5% by earnings in my country, because made it because im a programmer in a place where they are in a significant deficit. People in IT are being paid 2-3 times more than the average person, and thats for someone with around 3 years of experience. Wages can get higher for people with a lot more experience. Basically whatever you request as a salary you can get(without going into extremes)

Didnt expect to be able to travel as much as i can, to have a lot of different hobbies. Didnt expect to be able to buy whatever i want. I just go in the store, i see something i like and dont think about how much it costs, if i want i just go and get it. Didnt expect to be able to save a third of my salary without even trying to save. If i want to i could save up to 60%, if i try i can spend it all every month.


I dont get how people making 30-50% of what i make are allowing themselves a lifestyle i'm not allowing myself. 

* I'm renting with a roomate, while they are buying apartments.

* Dont own a car because i find it expensive, while they are driving $60-100k(the equivalent) cars.

* A couple of months ago a guy i met said that he wants to buy the latest Huawei phone that would cost more than his whole salary, so he would have to get it with a plan."
"Female superior at a work dinner, said aloud across a table filled with colleagues, when I was 22 years old: ""Oh, you're on my list. I'd fuck you. I'd totally fuck you.""

Apparently some of the women in the office maintained a ""guys in the office we'd fuck"" list. Everyone laughed. I was so embarrassed. 

To this day, I still wonder ""Imagine if one of the male managers said this to a female employee?"""
My ex used to kick in her sleep. There is nothing worse than being forcibly expelled from REM sleep by blinding pain in the downstairs mixup. 
There’s actually *tons* of videos busting dudes for wackin it in public. This is such bullshit. Do we really need to say “don’t beat off in the middle of a public place!” to people? Wtf name and shame that bitch. She can go to the restroom and flick the bean next time.

I would hope you left her bro. Demons don't fuck around.
"She got mad at me for using the rinse scrubber on dirty dishes and not using the dirty dish scrubber. They were both the same brand and kind of scrubber. I wasn’t upset but it didn’t help that I switched them on her and watched her clean dishes a few days in a row before telling her and going “See you can’t tell the fucking difference” ... yessir.... don’t ever do that to a Hispanic woman, she blew the fuck up on my ass 😂"
Husband does what I call systems check as he falls asleep. Different muscles twitch like thigh then wrist then  bicep etc.
"This is the most underrated comment on here.

If I already think you're attractive, most things short of watching you murder baby seals will be a turn on.  If I think you're a hideous weirdo, the fact that you're stumbling over your words is only going to make everything more uncomfortable than it already is."
"I would say 100% of the time, but one time someone said that line to me and a few months later we got together. That being said, I would probably never pursue someone after getting the “not looking for anything” line again at this point in my life. It’s not worth it and persistence after that point isn’t a good look for anyone. "
"Just to reassure you, sleep talkers can babble complete crap. She might not have even had you in mind with these words but a random phantom in that dream. 

Hope this helps a little, I'm sorry you had to go through this though. "
I think you have amnesia 
"This happened to me at a music festival once, too. Granted, I wasn’t wearing what you were wearing but a girl walks up behind me and gives my ass a proper squeeze, she chuckles, then walks away.

I didn’t know what to think. At first I was sure she confused me with someone else because I’m not what I would call “attractive”. As I watched her walk away with her friend, I became angry. All I could think about was what if I had grabbed her butt like that? I would have be kicked in the nuts, slapped and probably arrested. Why do girls think that’s okay to do? I was absolutely shocked but eventually let it go once the booze kicked in."
Dominance asserted
Plot twist. She was the ex. 
"Omg this is so bad for her teeth and jaw!!! Has her dentist not pointed out the damage she’s doing to her teeth?  If she hasn’t already, I would encourage her to speak with her dentist about the long-term damage it’s doing to her teeth as well as the options they can give her for a custom fitting mouth guard. The ones from the dentist are so much better than the ones you get at the store.  After a few nights you don’t even realize they’re there. I am able to use my Invisalign braces in place of a mouthguard.  If she needs braces, she can kill two birds with one stone!"
"The first time my boyfriend went down on me, he got a nosebleed. Imagine my face when his head pops up and he says “it tastes like pennies”"
The term I like to use is brovaries.
Confirmed. My boyfriend told me we had 12 tiny tomatoes living in our garage. 
"If I were up watching a funny show or movie while my ex was asleep, any time I would laugh or even chuckle in the slightest, she would giggle and laugh along with it, but remain perfectly asleep - snoring and all."
Plus cooking can be a lot of fun for everyone in the family. I know I personally love to cook in general and I think it comes from making dishes with my parents.
"Hell, don’t say “no” and he’s on the sex offenders list when she decides it wasn’t consensual two weeks later "
She’s forming a cocoon.
lol my first thought was someone threw a rock at someone else
"I'm not sure why people dont get this. If someone likes you they will be happy to go on a date with you. If they're not, then you shouldn't be pressing the issue at all. You're going to get hurt and annoy the shit out of them and make them want to stay away from you.

It's not worth wasting time and mental health on trying to be with people that dont like you that way. People know pretty quickly if they like you and are attracted to you. If that simple starting point is there, they will date you. Otherwise there's no ambiguity if someone doesnt tell you Yes. It's a No, and it should be treated as a permanent No, even if they act nice to you after.

It seems like people get rejected politely then get all surprised that the person still acts friendly like ""if they smiled at me they must be attracted to me!"" No, they're just adults and they can move on and be friends even after you expressed the desire to fuck them. Just be grateful and act mature about it."
"Lol nice. I've been in DR my whole life, I know how toxic the image of masculinity can be here."
"This, i have seen mostly girls doing this. Not men."

This one's the worst here.  I couldn't even handle that shit for a single night.
"My boss bought a pink salt rock for her office and one for mine. She insists I keep it on at all times, even when I leave the office. She said it helps “heal my mind” while I work. That still doesn’t explain why I have to keep it on while I’m gone."
My ex used to try and start fights about the fact I don't fight or argue.

Came home on my lunch break for a quicky. Accidentally called 911 in the process. They heard the whole 45 seconds of it. 
"I was at a nightclub with a friend (girl) and a couple of her friends, and one of the girls flirted with me, i told her i wasnt interested, and I had a girlfriend. She kept flirting, and told me that she wouldn't tell anyone about it. And when i kept saying no, she then groped my penis and ass, while trying to pursuade me to take her home and fuck her, so i pushed her away and got angry at her. Then i walked over to my friend and told her i was going home, and my friend told me that i should just see it as a compliment, and that she wanted me to stay. She didnt understand why i wanted to go home and acted like her friend did nothing wrong, i got mad and went home. When i told my girlfriend about it, she laughed and agreed with my friend, that i shouldnt be upset about it. Im not friends with the girl anymore, but im still in the relationship. After arguing with my girlfriend for a couple of hours, trying to get her to understand why it wasnt funny and actually a bad experience, she understood, at least she said she did, why i was upset. Although she is very much able to acknowledge that men have feelings, and shouldnt hide them, that one hurt. 
I have no doubt, that if i stayed at the club after the episode, she wouldve tried to rape me.
Every single girl ive ever told the story to, has laughed, even my mother.

"Best advice, learn how to [budget](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/Budget-planning/) and live below your means. Depending on your qualifications, you might want to consider furthering your education and switching to a high demand field. 

The next step is to save for an [emergency fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/emergency-fund/), which depending on necessity, is 3-12 months of living expenses. The emergency fund is the pinnacle of financial security. 

The rest of the money, should be used to maximise yearly pension contributions, you folks in the US call it a 401(k). 

Once you are done saving for your emergency fund, you could check out /r/financialindependence. They all try to live as /r/frugal as possible and mostly invest in index funds. 

* /r/personalfinance has a good ""reading material"" list, buying a book or two is a good way to get started.

Right? This is incredibly sweet. 
"I used to date a girl who took some sort of medication for her mental health. Idk what it was but one of the adverse side effects was night sweats. Like, full blown drenchers from the deepest recesses of her body. It smelled so awful and would completely soak both sides of the bed. It was really gross. "

"This is one of my hot buttons.  I'm NOT fucking babysitting, I'm a FATHER.  A DAD.  At least it weeds out the fucking idiots I'm not going to waste my time on early in the conversation...."
"I could go on forever. Last week I woke for work hours before she had to get up for her work. So I sneak out without waking her to shower. When I was done, i go downstairs to find her rummaging through the cupboards, obviously still tired, in just a tshirt and it was freezing. When i asked what she was doing, she replied ""I'm making you a sandwich for your lunch"". She got up to make me a lunch and see me off.

I'm doing everything i can to keep her."
"Depression, anxiety, inferiority, etc. I keep that shit to myself. Nobody fucks or promotes that guy. I quit drinking all the time because it was expensive and unhealthy, but I miss those nights on the porch where I could be my own friend after a few drinks."

"I was at a bar in Hollywood once and this ultra gorgeous blonde came up to me and introduced herself.  Literally her 2nd sentence was ""So how much money do you make?""  I'm not kidding - she actually asked me that.  

I asked her if she was serious and she nodded and grabbed my arm as if I found this as amusing as she did.  My only response that I could think of due to being in shock from the audacity of the question was ""have a good night"" and I turned and walked away.

I kept saying to myself for the rest of the evening ""is this real life?""...ugh...Hollywood

A man would never ask that to a woman - at least I never have."
"As a fellow Michigander, who the hell doesn't save their cans? There's like a 90% return rate in this state because of that 10¢. Then you return a whole cart load and have a cheaper grocery bill, that or donate to local bottle drive to help whatever school team is raising money."
"My brother and I were like this until we lived in different towns. Sometimes even now I will visit and we have complete conversations without any details and no one knows what we are talking about. 
I see people do it and wonder how but it wasn’t till my partner pointed it out once I realised my bro and I do it too! "
"Didn't know there was a name for it but I've had it for a couple months now. I really want a kid, I just know I'm not quite ready for one. Kinda hope it's a phase and it goes soon. I do really want to have kids, just not yet, but dream more of the day when I both can and do have them rather than straight up want one right now. If I got a girl preggo and she wanted to keep I'd be pretty screwed at the moment. 


A few of my friends around my age have kids and I've started to get really jealous of them recently from the things they're putting on their Snapchat stories. I remember thinking ""rip them"" when I found out they got someone pregnant and now it's the complete opposite. I remember years ago I was out and my friend had some girl in the car with her baby screaming it's head off and I was thinking why anyone would want that, but nowadays I'll sometimes go out with my friends and their kid(s) to the park or something and it's sweet. 

&gt;Do you watch cute pregnancy vlogs or is that just us gals?

Nah I don't take it that far, mainly just thoughts of being a dad really. "
"This is me kinda. I need so much sleep. It drives my husband absolutely insane. I can wake up, make coffee and get ready to go to target and I’m exhausted. I’ll push myself to go to frickin target, and I am absolutely just doooone. I get so tired doing anything. Need naps constantly "
"Given enough time every person you know will need money.  From my experience, about 9 out of 10 of those people will ask you for a ‘loan’.  Most of the requests come via social media, text or email with a back story attached.   A small group of the people don’t ask but just tell you of their financial hardship during back-and-forth-conversation but never outright ask,  They say things like an extra $10,000 would make all this issue go away.   Another part I didn’t expect was how many ask for others.   Some portion of your daily life will be to sort through these requests, refer them to a third party for processing or flatly decline then all.  "

"If she can't do the dishes correctly, and you're redoing them anyway, then it seems to me that rather than making it an area of contention, you should just declare that the dishes are your daily chore and that she doesn't need to do them anymore. I don't know anybody that would fight over wanting to clean the dishes."
Tell her the inverse property. 15% of 50 is the same as 50% of 15 — 7.5. Also to do 20% she can move the decimal to the left and double that amount. So 20% of 50 is 10. 
"Agreed. It would be way harder in my opinion in his scenario rather than a middle class scenario where children see that value out of the gate.

"Wife and I had almost two months where we were just fighting constantly over the stupidest shit. I felt like she was going out of her way to pick fights constantly. She felt like I ""had just upped my pain in the ass factor"" (exact quote). So it built and built and after almost two months, I was done and told her as much. We got into a horrendous fight on a family vacation (over plying tennis) that was pretty damn close to the end of us. Found out a couple days after that she was eight weeks pregnant, and a hormonal mess. Her response? ""I guess that's why I haven't been a nice friend."""

"So friend if mine calls me, it's like 7:30 and he's slurring. Sounds drunk, but says he's hurt and needs help. Okay, I always promise my friends, noon or midnight, call and I'm there. Show up to his place and there is blood everywhere, and just him sitting on the ground, head wound he has attempted to clean, and the remains of a jack Daniels bottle.

His fiancee has smashed the bottle over his head and left with friends because she wanted to go party, but said friend had been like ""our land lord is coming tomorrow and your part of the chores aren't done."" So she whiskey bottled the guy. So, I checked him, serious concussion, pretty bad head wound, needs medical attention. Knock at the door, and it's the police. Turns out she claimed her assaulted her, had bruises on her wrists from ""him"". (Point that doesn't get involved in this story, but needs to be made, they were actually from her friend who did it to file a false police report ). Cops still wanted to arrest my friend because he might have done it, even though he's been beaten stupid. Ended up taking him to a hospital (luckily) and getting him looked after.

As we got to the hospital, cop was taking my statement, I told them she had a history of verbally abusing him, assaulting him and such. Cop just kind of shook his head and went ""yeah, but he's a man."" Don't think it was meant derrogatory, just sad. "

I kinda felt it when I saw my ex babysitting. She was so good with the baby and I kinda wanted to put a baby in her. Also sometimes when I pick a baby up and play with a baby I do think I wouldnt mind one of these. It's very much linked to being with an SO for me.

I'm enjoying my natural kids right now, but plan on adopting until I'm too old to do so after that. I do a lot of music and art, so I'm used to having a kid right there with me, helping them do their thing. Some people were born to be rock stars, or extreme athletes. I was born to be a dad. And I naturally have jokes for days. My friends growing up thought I had a crappy sense of humor. Nope. I was just telling dad jokes this whole time. "

Just always be there for her. Tell her that no matter what, she can talk to you. I got out of some pretty sticky situations thanks to my brother, because I could trust him. If you’re going to college, make an effort to call her once a week or something like that. Have some fun activities planned for when she visits, or when you go back home. Just make sure every time you see each other you have fun. 

When her interests/hobbies start to flourish, take an interest in them. This will be tough because of the huge age gap, but effort is what matters. I ended up becoming hugely similar to my brother (not my sister who is only 4 years older) because he always made so much more of an effort with me than she did. More than anything, be there for her and make an effort to get to know her. "

The slightest sneeze or cough will wake her up and it will take an hour for her to fall back asleep.

"Once had sex with a guy in Russia who farted with every thrust. He would say, “oops,” every freaking time which just made it so much more obvious. He also kept chicken peck kissing me. It was so uncomfortable.

ETA: Now that I’m not half asleep, I’ll write the whole story...

I was working and living in Russia, and I meet this guy, Igor, who wants to take me on a date. I was instantly attracted to how assertive and chivalrous he was. He would open doors for me, bring me flowers, order my food (which was weird, but apparently that’s what Russian dudes do). It was just a very different dating experience from American men, but he was also really funny and smart. He had a great personality, and we got along very well. 

We go on a few dates, and things are going well. One night we’re watching a movie at my apartment, and we start making out on the couch. Turns out he’s a phenomenal kisser too, and I’m thinking “he’s probably great in bed.” He stops kissing me and says we should go into the bedroom. *Okay.* I don’t know what the heck happened between the couch and the bedroom, but his whole demeanor changed in the blink of an eye. He suddenly became really shy and awkward. I’m sitting on the bed and he’s standing in front of me taking off his clothes, but he’s shaking like a freakin’ leaf. I say, “You know we don’t have to do this if you’re uncomfortable. It’s fine,” but assures me he’s okay although he’s acting like I’m about to whip with a belt. It’s a miracle he didn’t cry. 

Anyway, he sits down, and I’m expecting him to ravage me, but instead he says, “Ok, you should take off your clothes now.” **wat?** I was thinking this was just a Russian thing, because you know, generally, both parties help each other undress. He’s still shaking like a leaf, and he starts chicken pecking me all over my face and neck. I’m so confused that I’m basically speechless at this point. He opens my legs and tells me he wants to go down on me. *Awesome.* But then he starts chicken pecking me there too! I’m even more confused, and I tell him to just lick instead. So he does, but not in the right places. I tell him to stop and he asks if he can put it in me because he doesn’t want a BJ. I’m still hoping things will get better, but the above (OP) happens. I get annoyed with the constant chicken pecking, so I turn my head and look at the wall, but he pecks the side of my face near my ear instead. It was so weird and automatic. *fart, “oops,” peck, repeat.” Was he a robot in disguise?

At some point I should have stopped all of it, but a small part of me kept hoping that assertive guy would return. After 10 or so minutes I find myself having my first orgasm (via penetration). I’m happy that I came and that this sex is finally over, sad that I came from that experience, and confused because *what just happened?* 

I don’t know if he was a virgin, had performance anxiety, or what. He pretended nothing weird ever happened, and I was just like “Deuces ✌🏻”

"I've been perceived as rich ..and I was on my way to get rich in real...I didn't care and gave it away. Now I wish I didn't give it away. This did help me understand people:

1. When they perceive you are rich, you can basically get praised for pure bullshit. They'll laugh at your bad jokes etc.
2. Some of your old acquaintances will emerge out of nowhere and would want to catch up. 
3. If they realize you aren't as rich as they thought you were, they'll vanish in thin air. 

So, I have stopped caring about maintaining relationships with people who are seasonal. Never worry about friends...just make money and you'll have plenty of them. Just be aware of the reason why they are your friends and you can have a pretty good time...."

"Women always say to be open and talk about emotions but they're really not able to handle or know how to react when a man is emotional. It's like when they describe how men should behave VS what they're really attracted to.

One thing that really makes me sad is how many times I hear women share stories about their boyfriends, really intimate secrets that we're never meant to be shared but are used as ammunition for gossip around the lunch table at work. My sense is that women don't really think of mens emotions as real as theirs. It's either that or they're simply not as empathetic towards men as with each other."

"Well there were a very individual personal change I didn't expect (my parents broke up contact when my own business was a success and it became apparent that I won't work for my father again / be in charge of the family business one day) but I don't think that is what OP has in mind with the topic. 

Other than that I had to realize that 

a) there are people much richer than me. I do okay, I started six years ago, have my own company and enough money to maintain a good lifestyle for the next 100 years spending 10000s of Euros each month for shit. But I am nowhere near let's ""buy a private jet / buy custom yacht / an apartment building in Monaco"" wealthy. Probably never will be. It doesn't really bother me but a lot of people don't realize how much it costs to buy and maintain these things. As a friend once put it: Its cheaper to own and run 100 Ferraris than a mega yacht. 

b) money makes it much more difficult to find a partner. I look okay, I am fit, I am single, I am a hell of a dancer and I drive a Ferrari. I get along with women. But where do I meet the woman of my life? No ""Bondgirl"" but a real partner I can have a relationship with. 
A lot of my school friends got to know their partners through university or - even more common - work. So will I meet the woman of my dreams at my workplace? No, it's my company so every woman working there is an employee and therefore off limits to begin with. In my leisure time? What leisure time? ;) I don't have much leisure time and usually don't spend it where I meet a lot single women. I sometimes help out in a friend's dancing school when they don't have enough men that attend the courses but nothing serious came out of it. 
And last but not least there is this problem that you could find someone that you really like and then it turns out that she only pretended to like you and was after the money the whole time. Sucks. 

c) It's overall kinda hard to find someone that you can talk to at times. As I stated before I don't have a permanent girlfriend and I don't have family here. The only family members that still talk to me live ~1000km away in France. My friends from school face other issues in their lives than I. I still enjoy their company but we aren't that close. I have several friends that are in a similar position as myself and probably could relate to my problems but they live in France / Italy and when we meet we usually don't talk a lot about serious topics. 
So to summarize it I am left with one friend I can talk to and my uncle and both live more than 1000km from here. Other than that I only have my lawyer and my secretary. I trust them to 100% but they still are employees... 

d) that you won't be as independent as you'd like. A lot of the times when I talk to my friends from school they make fun about how easy life could be with a few millions on the bank. Virtually all their problems would be solved. 
What they don't realize is that you won't get that much money without some commitments as long as you don't win it or get it as a present. I e.g. feel like I cannot stop working since I have employees. I could sell my company but I fear that their situation would worsen under a new management. I don't think I could lean back and enjoy life knowing that the people that helped me to be successful are now in trouble. I also would miss my business to some degree.

"Went from socially anxious, lack of confidence in bed to being called super confident by girls I date, leading business meetings with company leaderships, having a lot more acquaintances and friends, etc.

Few things I did:

- I started attacking aggressively areas where I don't feel confident, or feel anxious. Too anxious to dance? You gonna dance tonight buddy! Feel like you're the most useless person in the coworking space and feel like throwing up? Cool, chill out tonight and you'll be back tomorrow. Feel like you're too small of a fish to whip a bunch of millionaires into shape in a meeting? Well, buckle up buddy, we're going whipping! Same applies to talking to girls, or anything really.

- Positive affirmations. Always thought they were stupid, but hey, somebody has to remind me that I'm awesome and have a lot of positive sides. 

- Building a valuable life. I try to always take another step towards being a more valuable person, in some sense of the word. My next profile picture is gonna be more kickass, so that I can keep on seeing how good looking I am, actually. I will dress a little better next month, so that I get used to seeing myself in sharper clothes. I will create a better daily routine, so that I feel like I'm more efficient, while also having more time to myself when needed. I then approach people as somebody who has value = confidence in my interactions.

- Realize truths about people. Pretty girls still doubt their looks at times. Superstar fuckboys lie in bed, wondering what life is even about, at times. We all have some inner issues we struggle with, we just don't talk about them at the office or when we run into somebody in the streets. A millionaire actor might seem super happy, and then you hear the news about his mental health issues and a suicide. We're all just human. That's something that takes pressure off of me.

- Don't stress about it. Do it. Just do stuff. Don't overthink it. 

- Realize that living in confidence is a habit. You need to rewire your brain, slowly. Just take it one step at a time. Be kind to yourself, but move forward. It takes time, but that's OK."

"I wouldn't say to focus on not procrastinating, but more on studying efficiently, as doing so when absolutely bored out of your mind does not do you any good. This saves you from having to procrastinate because you are not mentally exhausted from studying. 

So for example: 

1. Don't study in large stretches of time, study at the same time every day, and set a goal for each session. 

1. When taking notes, write only the conclusions and any questions that naturally arise from whatever you did and didn't understand about the material. Don't ask these questions yet unless it is critical to understanding the material at the moment.

1. Question your knowledge and try to determine if you know something because you memorized it or because you understood it. Try to answer yourself the questions from point 2.


1. If you believe you understand the material then try to explain it to someone and attempt to answer their questions. If you don't, ask your classmates/professor/TA. Write down in detail what is the thing you don't understand, language can be tricky somethings, but if you are in a STEM field then written equations or diagrams can better explain your problem.

1. Even if you believe your method is wrong in solving a problem, then solve it using that method anyway. Then try to retrace from the end why it doesn't work for the problem, and what is and isn't needed.


1. STEM: Dimensional analysis is almost like cheating in solving problems and can easily explain on its own difficult fields."

Listen lady, I'm sure you've experienced your fair share of sexism, but 1: You are not getting your nipples grabbed by strangers *everyday* and 2: Just because he's a guy doesn't mean he fucking liked/deserved it.

I've been in literally that exact position before, and I can't tell you how strange it is to experience it as a guy.  You know in the back of your mind that no one will take you seriously, so you don't say anything.  But you still feel weird, so maybe you do say something to a friend.  Then that friend giggles at you.  

Then it happens again, and some woman says she wants to grab your balls, and gets handsy with you.  And this time you know that no one will give a fuck if you say anything, so you let it slide, even though you're married.  And you listen to all the #metoo stories on the radio and know that no one will care about you if you brought it up.  And then you think about every other time you've been hurt by women who literally laughed in your face at your pain, and think about how unfair it is that your pain doesn't count because you have a dick.  And if you *are* hurt, you're just #masculinitysofragile or if you are angry you are #toxicmasculinity and again, no one cares."

Drove back to my place in silence, and it took 4 hours to blow over. The irony of the song in question was completely lost on us at the time. "
"I was watching my little brother on the playground once and a lady approached me and told me it was inappropriate for me, an adult man, to “do what I was doing.” I assured her I was only there to keep an eye on my brother, to who I then pointed to, and she just raised her brow and walked away. So yeah, I would say the immediate assumption I was at the park to watch little children is something I would guess women don’t normally have said to them. "
Because he accepted a magic deal from an askreddit post
"Pretty much, yeah. She did warn me though, and I have no trouble going back to sleep so it didn't exactly ruin my sleep."
"My SO does this too! Says she doesn't want them to ""flop about"""
My fiance and I were just talking about this last night. I HATE unloading but he doesn't mind. I don't mind loading the dishwasher but he hates it just as much as I hate unloading. Hahah funny how it works out sometimes.
Bust out the good khakis 
Disappointed that they didn’t ask for permission before moving in. 
"My girlfriend does this, she falls asleep before me and I'll stay awake to read or watch TV for a bit to get tired. My girlfriend will wake up, turn to me, and say something completely random.  

Her: ""The groceries are in the bath cage...."" 

Me: ""What babe, what did you say....?"" Looks over to find her completely passed out sleeping.

Also me: ""Wtf......."""
"Girl here:
He had used a Neti pot maybe two hours or so before we had sex. Usually I was on top but this time, he insisted he be on top. We were going at it pretty hot and heavy, then BAM...like 3oz of salty sinus juice sloshed all over my face. "
"&gt;Attend every class. People who flunk out are always the ones who are consistently late/ don’t go to class.

I skipped the majority of my classes. I just cannot learn from lectures, I need to read to learn. It's weird, I guess. "
My BF always fills glasses of water and puts them on the dresser. I’ve woken up to 4 full glasses on my dresser.
I had a chiropractor named Dr Hold back.
"&gt; She insists she's only said good things, thankfully.

you think that's really true? "
"Very inspiring for a 20 year old\*

"On the contrary, someone told me that ""money doesn't change people, it just reveals who they really are."""

"My wife and I had an argument and after it was over I sat at the kitchen table and cried quietly to myself. She came out of the other room, saw me walked over to me leaned over the table got right in my face and said ""Aww, you going to cry now you little pussy""? ""Why don't you put your big girl panties on and act like a real man""? 

People say things in fights they wish they hadn't, but this cut me deep I'll remember this for nearly as long as I live. "
Taking off my belt
Im guessing he forgot to change his NSFW account before commenting 
"This may sound simple, but I wish my wife would take the lead more. Sometimes she is very passionate, but 90% of the time I'm the one leading things and taking charge. Sometimes my wife will complain that I didn't get her off, but when she is just laying there it is hard to tell what she is feeling. If ladies want to get off more they should take charge more. "
"I retired from dating for a while, after a spectacularly bad relationship/breakup and run of bad luck. I just needed time to regroup, see what I was doing to help make that possible, and enjoy other parts of life til I was gtg. It wasn't forever. 

I never phrased it as ""I'm not looking for a relationship"", but the concept was similar. "
"Even better, men who think kids are cute and talk to them in public (with their parents present obviously and completely fine with it) are pedophiles, but the same behavior in women is being a ""natural mother"".

A few days ago I was in a grocery store check out line and a little kid sitting in the cart dropped a pack of crayons. I pick them up and hand them to her, her mom says ""oh, thank you!"", and some old lady gives me the evil eye like I'm molesting little kids!

It's like we're not allowed to think kids are cute without their being inappropriate intent!"

How do you catch one?
"My wife has a double MS in remote sensing and cartographic engineering - probably one of the smartest individual human beings I know (haha then why did she marry me) and she's just... unable to see jokes.  I mean, she logically understands jokes happen, but she just doesn't get the humor. "

"This is definitely true. I actually broke off a friendship with a girl because she would only ever talk about sex with her boyfriend. 
It made the rest of our friend group uncomfortable, but whenever we brought it up, she complained that we didn’t care about her relationship. 
Pretty sure a relationship isn’t 100% about sex, but whatever. Just let me eat my lunch without hearing all the details ya lunatic. 

Her and her boyfriend were both narcissistic and a bit crazy though, so I guess we should have seen it coming. "
Sounds like someone failed on day 1
"I don't think so. 1% starts at 489k.

You don't realize just how rich the ultra rich are, How few of them there are, and how quickly it drops off behind them.

That's why I didn't like occupy wallstreet. its the .001% that is a problem."
"Today she was handed a clipboard and asked to record obstacle course times for the kids at a Cub Scout cookout.  Because it involved numbers she almost didn't accept.  I'm happy to report, she did great!  "
"&gt;How many of you would be content or even happy without ever having to work again?

I'd be delighted assuming I was financially capable of living a lifestyle that I could enjoy.

how do you date someone who doesn't have a sense of humor? is everything just serious all the time?
Husband uses GPS to go 2 miles anywhere near our house. 
"No. And I don't want to know about my friends sex life with their wives either. That stuff is private and should stay there.
