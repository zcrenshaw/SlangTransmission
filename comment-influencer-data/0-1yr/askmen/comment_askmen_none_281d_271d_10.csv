I was about his age the first time I saw Return of the Jedi. Slave Leia did it.
I just want to throw in that most girls don't want to blow you for half an hour.
I was furiously masterbating at 9. 
"Alright this is gonna hurt but it's true and us men all gotta realize it. 

If you're texting/snapping a girl or whatever and you get things like this

""Omg I'm sorry I JUST saw this"" on a text from 8 hours ago

You ask her to hang out that night and she's busy but ""maybe some other time"" and she doesn't eventually give a specific date or try to make plans

She consistently takes hours to answer snaps or texts cuz let's be real 95% of us are always on our phones

She's not interested at that time and you gotta drop it. You save yourself the anxiety of wondering and the embarrasment of eventually getting told to leave her alone if you push too hard"
"I hate explaining to people that I'm spending time with my son. I'm not just babysitting him cause my wife is busy.

Update: Holy cow! My first silver and gold in one comment! Thank you kind redditor!

I know my account says only 6 days old but I also have a 4 year old account that's been hacked and Im waiting for mods to help me gain access to it again.  So finally getting a silver and gold is freaking awesome!"
At the gym (like 1-2 years ago) these 3 girls were giggling/laughing as well as pointing at me while taking pictures so I told the manager about it (who I'm friends with) and I got them kicked out. If you go to the gym just to laugh at fat dudes like me then you are a piece of shit.
"I used to work in HR for a children’s mental health agency where traumatized children were housed on site for intensive therapy.  

I was the only male in the entire department, my job was to do all the hiring, and my boss came to me and said that before I could hire any man I had to give this new test “which tested if they were a pedophile”.  

The test was only to be given to men who we wanted to hire and if they failed we couldn’t hire them.  They’d then be added to a “internal pedophile list”.

I was highly skeptical but before I pushed back too hard I wanted to research it more.  I spoke with the testing sales rep and she was unable to provide anything to indicate the testing was even remotely data validated or peer reviewed.  Sales rep said they couldn’t prove their tool worked because “pedophiles are good at getting away with diddling kids” and “only men are sex offenders”

I tried to stay objective on the whole thing but it was hard and after I heard everything that was said from the people selling the test I couldn’t in good conscience use the tool as it was total snake oil, plus my boss was equating people failing the test with people being an actual pedophile.  

The entire department fell in lock step with her and what was I going to do... go to bat for child molesters?  At least that was the optics of it. 

In the end my boss insisted on it’s use and I started quietly interviewing for a new job.  It’s still in use today.  Labeling men pedophiles without them having ever done anything, even being accused of anything, no due process. 

Even today it bothers me that I didn’t stand up publicly against it.  

Edit: some people were asking which test it was, I think it was a third party company that did a modified version of the Able Test.  Back when this happened there was very little info about it, when this happened this wiki didn’t exists and I couldn’t find references in any academic database searches. Here is it’s wiki https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Assessment"
"That I don't always want sex.  

And when I don't want sex, it's not because I suddenly find my wife unattractive or because I've been sleeping around.  I just don't happen to want sex at that moment."
That as a man I cannot be raped or sexually assaulted. 
"Older lady I knew during a discussion about a family member losing a testicle.

""Now he'll only ever be able to have boys or girls but never both.""

""Excuse me?""

""He only has one, so he'll only make either boys or girls.""

""So one ball makes girls, the other makes boys?""

""Yes.""

""No."""

You're alright mate.
"Here in the software field, I can tell you that female college grad applicants come off way, way more nervous than males, on average.  Even when they're super smart and nailing every question I ask.  I can't tell if it's actually nerves or if it's a demure ""don't want to seem arrogant"" act, or what.

I've done hundreds of interviews, it's crazy how true this is.
"
"Dude, don't fucking worry about it. "
"My pet peeve is that an erection is under conscious control. Despite the common stories of teenaged guys popping boners for literally no reason, no one believes male rape is possible because if a guy is erect then he must want sex.

Men can be stimulated into erection and ejaculation against their will. This is exactly the same situation where a woman has an involuntary orgasm during rape. The worst part is that many guys don't realize this myth and bear unnecessary guilt because of it."
"That just because I'm helping out at the local animal shelter, i'm clearly a criminal doing community service. 

Nope, I just like cats and dogs. "
"That just because I’m a male nurse doesn’t mean I’m gay or in school to be a future doctor. 

Also every male in scrubs in a hospital is not automatically a doctor. "
"Just because I have boner doesn’t mean I want sex. They just pop up randomly sometimes. Got into a huge fight with my wife about this. 

Her friend came over and the three of us were hanging out chatting in the living room. I got a boner and my wife could see it through my basketball shorts but I wasn’t tenting or anything I kept it low until it went away. Her friend leaves and she explodes on me saying I think her friends hot and I want to fuck her friend. I said no, they just happen sometimes. That was a fun 3 hours"
"Was in charge of interviewing grads this year during first round. Women in general were very safe with their answers and almost robotic. Men were more inconsistent. Some were absolutely shite and some were exceptional.

"Yeah exactly, she's trying to make you nut, just do it, sex doesn't end when you finish, push her down on the bed and have some fun after. "
"not me, but my boyfriend (i’ve also shared this on AskReddit) when we first started hooking up (which was my first time) I remembered a cosmo-esque tip about how to get a man to cum. basically it was just to punch him straight in the balls when he’s about to finish, and it’s supposed to shoot out. so during sexy times it went something like this:

him: *regular moaning*

me: *aggressively probably* you‘d like it if i punched you in your balls, wouldn’t you?

him: ...no?

I had to explain how I’d never handled a penis and read that that was a thing. looking back I don’t know why I thought punching someone in the most sensitive part of their body would bring pleasure.

EDIT: to whoever gave me reddit silver, thank you! I’ll have to tell my boyfriend sparing his testicles got me an internet award lol."
"That men are bumbling idiots when it comes to taking care of kids. That’s a crock of shit. It might have been true with earlier generations but that just isn’t the case anymore.

I’m the one who takes my kids to school and to their appointments every week. I prep their school bags every night. I bathe them every time and put them to bed. If one of them gets sick, I stay home with them. I cook them dinner nightly. I’d say I’m more competent with the whole parenting thing than my wife.

And you know what pisses me off the most? The comments from random strangers when they tell me, “it’s ok, you’re just the dad, their mom has got this.” Fuck you, I’ve got it and I don’t need comments from the peanut gallery.

**Edit:** So I didn't think this would get so much attention but thanks for all of the responses and updoots.

Some of you have pointed out about evolution of parenting and that the stereotype wasn't always there. While this might be true, at some point in history, the stereotype was born and became a comedic trope. But that hasn't stop women from eyeing me at the grocery store and then asking for proof that my daughter is my daughter. Or being ostracized at a birthday party because I'm the only dad there with his kids. Or being approached at a park and accused of being a pedophile for making sure my kids are safe while they play on the playground. You can armchair point out that history has anecdotes of good men with parenting skills, but the reality is that dads get shit on in public. We're either the weird guy pedophile at the park, the kidnapper at the grocery store, the inattentive father who can't control his kids, or that we're babysitting for mom.

**Edit 2**: Wow Silver! Thanks kind random person!
**Edit 3**: Annnd my first gilding. Thank you! **Edit 4**: Another gold and silver! Thank you kind strangers!"

"""Oh! Giving mom a break, huh?"".... Fuck off."
"Here's the guideline that my family used:

If the child is old [mature] enough to ask the question, they're entitled to an honest and complete answer... That includes questions of a sexual nature; but, layered with ""Does that make sense?"" in that, we would give a succinct answer and then ask if that was enough, and if not, elaborate about what remained mysterious, or answer the follow up question.

Also, there's nothing wrong with simple nakedness, even after puberty begins (social studies indicate that it is healthy psychologically for kids, both to build body acceptance and thereby also destigmatize talking about sexual anatomy [if there were ever any sexual interference]); but, just like masturbation, there are privacy guidelines: be naked anytime at home around family (out of sight of the neighbours), and masturbate alone in a room with the door closed (we also allowed passage locks on bedroom doors if requested). Consequently, you need to institute a 'knock before entering' rule, and abide by it yourself, in addition to having your children follow the same rule: that way, you can also prevent being walked-in-on, when you're masturbating, or have a playmate in your bedroom. 

I was a precocious pubescent, and started 'liking girls' at age 8 (which was stigmatizing because all the other boys still thought girls were 'icky'), even though I knew nothing about how sex worked; although I did masturbate, it was never fixated on a person (I didn't even try that until I was a teenager). My kids are now teenagers.

BTW, OP: I think it's great that you allow your son the freedom to be naked at home, and I applaud you for seeking input about others' experiences of being a boy growing up, and how they might have preferred to have been credited and respected. I'm sure you're a great Mom!"

"Yeah I actually had to inform my SO that its annoying he holds back because I dont like oral in return, and bjs for 30-40 mins actually end up hurting my jaw and my mouth gets sore after from blocking my teeth from touching his dick. Im sure the girl is more than happy you lasted 1min

also to add on to this, if you hold back consistently Im sure the consistency of those bjs will come to a halt, its a lot of work to keep up that motion for that long. "

"Adding to what's been said, I've also noticed that people who are recommended to me are usually men. Now, if that's just a coincidence, sexism, or a matter of women networking less than men, I couldn't tell you.

Also, men are much more willing to negotiate a wage in their favor, whereas women are usually way more agreeable.

It's impressive the amount of people who don't know how to properly shake hands. More so the case with women, than men.

Women are, usually, very qualified for the job they're applying. I've had to throw away more resumes from men, than women.

Much like Tinder, it feels like men just leave curriculums everywhere, in hopes that *someone* will call, whereas women are much more decisive with what they want."
"This is fucked up!

"I definitely know it’s such a fine line between coming off as confident and coming off as arrogant or bitchy. I will make a hard effort to smile more and be bubbly, which kind of sucks, but that’s the way hiring goes. When we interviewed people, I never heard “that guy didn’t smile at all” in the post discussion, but I have heard things like, “she seems a little cold” or “didn’t seem too friendly”.  "

"I've been recruiting for 4 years now, mostly higher level business positions (avg. ttl comp~100k). Men, from what I've seen, sell themselves a lot harder and tend to be more confident about interjecting their accomplishments in a natural way. The women I've interviewed over the years are not as forward or aggressive about what they've done. There have been multiple times where I've asked probing questions in my initial interviews and gotten some really relevant details about projects they've worked on, and then the hiring manager never even hears about them from the candidate. Those candidates would have a much better shot if they had sold those accomplishments, but instead they waited to be asked about it and they never had an opportunity to share.

There's really been no difference in quality between male / female hires, it's really just interview capability and willingness to represent themselves in the best light."

"I don’t know how old you are, but I’m a woman on the wrong side of forty and as a kid growing up, I was inundated with the message that men want sex always, and if they don’t it’s because the woman is lacking in some way.  Not just in media, but also in sex ed classes at school.  At the time I didn’t think much of it because it was widely considered an indisputable fact.  But as an adult I look back and think how damaging that must have been for the boys.  I hope to heaven that with the changes in how society views sexuality, kids are getting a healthier and more nuanced message nowadays.

"When people say ""Daddy Issues"" they're usually referring to the insecurity a child develops from their father abandoning them that then manifests as vulnerabilities like attention seeking behavior, fear of rejection, and need for approval as an adult.

Mothers obviously abandon their children as well, but it isn't quite as common statistically speaking. A lot of the people who have crappy mothers weren't abandoned by their mothers, so their problems with them rise from different origins.

Why would you want to hold back though?  She probably thinks it's a great compliment that you cum so fast.
"Women tend to apply for their exact qualifications. Men tend to apply if the meet 60% or so. 

Conversely, companies tend to dismiss female applications if they don’t meet 90-95% of the qualifications, but will regularly interview men who meet only 75% or so.

"Yeah it was around 8-9 but I didn't start masturbating until I was 12. I would say my parents did a good job of preparing me for relationships but not sexuality. They never even let me know I could ask so I did it all on my own. I for got a lot of misconceptions from the internet but luckily I figured it out over time. I think the best thing you could do is sit him down, tell him that as he gets older his body will to through some significant changes over the next ten years and that he can talk to you, that you won't judge him or scold him but listen and try to answer his questions. Then I think it would be a good idea to go over how you changed and some of the problems you went though. Don't be ridiculously detailed but don't skip all of the awkward stuff because it will be awkward for him too.

Edit: Wow thanks for all the upvotes! I came back to add that you really shouldn't skip over the subject of masturbation. It's honestly a frightening experience for the first time, at least knowing that it's not abnormal would have really helped."

"I was at a bar with some close female friends and the topic of what we do with our dicks when we shit came up. They were convinced that we had to just lay our dicks on the toilet seat.I laughed and explained that when you shit, you pee a little, so you have to pipe that fucker in down the front of the toilet between your  legs and let it dangle. 

When this left my mouth they were all visibly horrified and didn’t believe me. I proceeded to try and explain that this was normal but they seemed to think that my dick was just stewing in a layer of fecal matter splashback everyday. This was made even worse by the fact that I was sleeping with one of them at the time and she looked at me like this was some sort of horrible revelation. In the end, they had to consult with other males to confirm whether or not this was true. 

Regardless, for the span of a few minutes, I started to second guess myself envisioning my dick covered in bacteria and poop debris. Even though my story was corroborated I never did sleep with the one girl again..."

"I was abandoned by my mom and as a result I had a tendency to find relationships with women who were just as abusive as my mom was. Went to therapy and found out that because I am good at making others feel comfortable enough to bring their guard down rather quickly and make them feel seen as a person, I seem to be a target for unstable women who think I can be the stability in their life or women who see my stability as something to keep their loneliness at bay until they find someone more desirable. As a result, I need to keep my guard up more for red flags so that I’m not taken advantage of. I essentially learned that I became my father who was a great man, but just taken advantage of a lot.


Edit: I see a lot of you saying you're taking insight from this and may have had similar issues in your life and I just ask that you please keep in mind that this was my individual case and it took quite a bit of therapy to figure out. If you're having similar issues and you have therapy available to you, please schedule an appointment, as you may end up finding out that your situation is drastically different than my own and requires a different approach.

I also want to thank those of you who are supporting our fellow community members here. Especially u/GetTheLedPaintOut. Take a look around at all of you who have been affected and embrace this kind of mutual sharing, confiding, and support.

"This notion that we have no real emotions besides being horny and angry/aggressive. We have a wide range of emotions, it's just that we many times don't know how to communicate or deal with them in a healthy manner. It can also be that we're extremely afraid of letting that side be seen again after multiple negative experiences. Many of us were never taught how to deal with our emotions. We also faced negative reactions when we did try opening up. We'd be met with dismissal and/or ridicule. A real man should not be insecure about things; a man should be confident. You should be stoic and never waver. If you want to attract a woman, you must be a man. This mentally ends up with many of us not being able to open up about our feelings. One of the few times when shedding tears seems acceptable for example, is when someone close to us dies. It must be an extreme event for us to be allowed to let out a basic emotion and not be looked down upon for it.

Then we have this other side we encounter, usually later on in life if we're older. A side that feels very contradictory to how we were raised and were told for a long time. The side that complains about our lack of emotions. Our inability to open up; to show or talk about emotions. The side that sometimes might say men have limited emotions, as is if was because of our DNA. 

We start struggling even more once we start facing negative consequences because of our inability to deal with emotions. We are left with two contradictory messages.  We start trying to figure out which one is the right answer, or try to strike a balance. Maybe we decide to start opening up and learn about ourselves. We're now far behind everyone else who had an upbringing that allowed them to explore this side and we now face new problems. Being this inexperienced in something so important might very well be a deal breaker to current or potential partners. They're left having to deal with someone who has the emotional skills of a teenager, if even that.

If you as a man or anyone for that matter continuously complain about your mother or whoever do something about it, don't just say well I cant do anything about it because it's my mom.

I mean I was skinny and people would tell me to eat more. The thing is I was so skinny cause no one fed my ass at home so I was just eating snacks all day. Once I started getting money myself I started actually eating full meals and I gained 30 pounds In 2 months. So I still want to gain weight and bulk up but shits hard now. 
Women don’t negotiate for themselves as much as men do.  Women will accept less money for the same role. 
"I've heard it referred to as the ""Greater Male Variability Hypothesis,"" basically, if you look at a distribution of performance comparatively between genders you find that men occupy the outer regions (very low and very high performance) more so than the women do, i.e., less exceptional women but also less utter failures.

Income is a prime example of this: more homeless and rich men than homeless and rich women, who tend to congregate more in the median income range.

 I personally find the hypothesis compelling because of how nicely it can tie into evolutionary explainable behaviors; the very simple explanation is that men take more risks, while women cherish opportunities granted to them, which in turn can be closely matched to effective reproductive strategies for each sex respectively.  

A man's consequence for reproductive failure is not as dire or consequential as a woman's, who must spend large amounts of time and energy to foster a child successfully.

Don't get confused thinking that this justifies certain 'base' behaviors; this is a reductionist perspective used to explain behavior and innate desire on a general scale, according to statistics, not stereotypes.

"If you treat sex and attention from women as your primary source of personal validation, you'll never be able to have a real, connected relationship with any women.  All your relationships will be about you, not her, and it'll hurt in the long run.

Too many guys fall into this trap.  It's understandable... as a culture we say it all the time.  But it's absolutely a trap."

"I mostly disagree with this honestly. Maybe not 1 girl, but if multiple girls are turning you down and you can't get any interest from girls, you need to start working on becoming more desirable guy (working on your ability to hold a conversation, working on your body, working on your career etc etc). 

I might be wrong, but its what I honestly believe. I always ask myself, If I were a quality chick would I want to be with me? "
"No smokers and no transgenders

And no fat chicks either"
JUST CUM. THATS THE POINT
"I think when people say stuff like “no fat chicks” or “no smokers” or “no drugs,” they’re probably just looking for a lifestyle that resembles their own. 

Would I date someone who is wildly overweight? Probably not, but I’m a gym rat and plan my days and diet around fitness plans so someone who wasn’t like that would probably be a bad fit for me.

Sure, it sounds offensive but most of the things in this thread are pretty much “I want someone like me and Thing X doesn’t jive with that.”"
"Best thing I’ve done in life is to learn to negotiate and “play like the men”. I was brought up to be agreeable and to take what I can get, but I decided to start applying to jobs I didn’t technically qualify for and I started getting interviews.

Wobbly lines, uneven shading, blown out colour etc, if it's going to be on your body forever have a think and get one well done tattoo for the same price as three or four shit ones."

She is not a terrible mother, I know she loves me and I had a great childhood. She is however, a bit on the colder side and does not show a lot of emotion if that makes sense. 

It does not necessarily have any bad influence on me except when I am single I am very easily picked up by girls (if you consider that a bad thing). Also, when I was younger, I used to fall ""in love"" very quickly if girls showed any affection towards me. But I know myself a lot more now so I am pretty sure the girl I am dating now is the real deal. "

I joined a board game group. Yes, there are more guys then girls. But, while the odds are skewed, I trust the guys there a lot more then a random stranger.

I dated a few guys from there over the years with much more success,

"I'd agree. In my experience a boy without a father figure can struggle with almost everything- work, relationships, friendships, self-image. I've generally seen girls without male role models (or shit ones) struggle with relationships only. Maybe that's my own observer bias.

Obviously it depends on the person, situation, etc. No rule fits all."
Most of my favorite teachers were men.
"Interesting, an intro to communications class I just finished talked about how in job-hunting situations, women are more ridiculed for being “cold” or somewhat unfriendly, due to the societal belief that women are supposed to be nurturing and caring while men aren’t."
"I’d say around 10 or 11. It wasn’t anything too significant, I just started to like girls more and more and notice how attractive they were. I’m not sure if there’s an age that’s too early, since everyone is different. Not every boy needs a “man” to teach them about sexuality, just a flexible perspective. I’d say teach your son about privacy, let him know that what he’s doing (i.e. masturbating) is okay, and how to respect girls. 

One of the most important things to teach him is that he should be comfortable around himself, understand what he likes and dislikes. Let him figure out certain things on his own at first, and if you feel you need to intervene or help him then go for it."

"To give a concrete example, I used to work as a receptionist/admin assistant at a local government place that dealt with vulnerable young people (youth offenders, homeless, unemployed, etc.).

Well one day one of the advisers told me that she was telling her young people that I was gay. I told her I was uncomfortable with her lying to young people (who due to their circumstances are already mistrustful and difficult to engage with) about me. She shrugged, so I went to my manager. She told me there was nothing she could do. At the end of the year my contract wasn't renewed.

In my opinion, if I wasn't a man, my complaint would have been taken more seriously. Who knows, I might've even kept my job."
"Relationship tools and advice. In the past I’ve searched for help for my own relationship issues. Apparently the issues I have are very common... for women. I found tons of resources for women experiencing my problems, but very few that were aimed at men. I think for my most pressing issue, I found one blog that was focused on men. It suggested I turn to Jesus and accept my life as is. Great. 

Unhealthy relationships lead to unhealthy minds. Men need more help on how to build and maintain healthy relationships, and how to avoid or leave unhealthy ones."

"OH MY GOD YES. I dated a girl and we were a match made in heaven, seriously she was a fantastic match for me. Absolutely perfect, almost. 

I have 2 children, a 3 year old and a 2 year old, her Daughter was 2 1/2. This little girl bit my children multiple times, had been kicked out of daycare (on 2 separate occasions by 2 different day cares.) and was openly rude as Fuck to my kids, and to her, and to me. This little prick 100% ruined our relationship after she moved in, we could agree that her Daughter was problematic, and that some of her parenting skills needed to be reassessed. She didn’t take the talk well and she ended up moving out. Rough to see that one go, but my kids are only here 4 days a week, out of those 4 days my kids shouldn’t be *afraid* to come home. Telling their mother (my ex) “we don’t want to go to daddy’s bc (the little girl) is there.” 

Swerve. I’m no perfect parent, my kids have never bit someone and have always had to share everything (being so close in age, buying toys is easy!)  But your child being removed from 2 different daycare places, and then after she bites my child THE VERY FIRST TIME, I told her this was not okay, do you know what she said to me “Revleckk, it’s a phase. All kids bite.” 


NIGGA NOT MINE, I GOT 2 GIRLS WHO HAVE NEEN THEOUGH HUNDREDS OF PLAYDATES WITH ALL KINDA OF CHILDREN AND HAVE NEVER EVEN COME CLOSE TO PUTTING THEIR MOUTH ON ANOTHER CHILD. NO THANKS. "
Never make someone a priority when you are just an option to them. 
"I started getting powerful crushes on girls at around his age, but I wouldn't say I began to be became sexually aware until about 13. As in, I never thought about sex or sexual acts before that. But I think this varies a lot in boys. It can't hurt to start having conversations with him about basic things now, like finding out what his conceptualisation of relationships and sex is now, and guiding it gently as he develops. Be aware that if he hasn't already, he will almost certainly be exposed to and seek our porn very soon. It's really important that this isn't the only source of information he has about what sex is, can be like or how adults relate to each other sexually. By all means give him privacy, but I would advise getting as tech savvy as you can with making accessing internet porn as difficult as possible in your house. Things like adult filters and password protected access after bed time etc. If you're lucky, he'll have to make due with whacking it to his imagination or maybe pics or gifs stashed away. If you can make it difficult for him to stream hard core porn in his room, that will go a long way in keeping him on an even keel.

EDIT: I'm getting bored of repeating myself now, so this is the last time I'll address it. **Yes, I know he will find ways to watch porn.** That's fine. The point isn't to shield him completely, that's impossible. The point is to do as much damage control as possible while also teaching him that sex is wonderful and not shameful, and giving him an understanding of context and nuance. He **will** jerk off to porn by sourcing it ingeniously - but that's no reason to give him unrestricted and unlimited access to all kinds of internet porn that may harm his development, the science on the effects of porn on developing brains is compelling, in my view. Just because it's not possible to stop a child viewing it completely, this is **no reason for the parents to abdicate their responsibilities to restrict and manage the child's access to inappropriate materials to the best of their ability,** in my view. No child *needs* hardcore internet pornography. If you disagree, fine, let your kids watch as much porn as they like and good luck to you."

"Depends on the quality of the father figure. A good father figure has a huge impact on your life, from teaching you to how to dress to teaching you how to treat women.

"I just hit 30.  Got my first gray hair, hoping I salt and pepper over the next few years.

I'd say it damages men just about the same way it damages women.  The first time I didn't want to have sex, my thoughts went to something being wrong with me.  I mean, I was a man, in my late teens.  I should be some sexual stallion always craving and performing and it wasn't like that.  Hell, even advertisements on the internet, radio and old TV commercials about ""male performance enhancing"" was rampant.  (I still remember that creepy Enzyte commercial with the smiling dude)  Like you said, it was common knowledge that men just wanted sex every chance they got, so anyone who didn't was different; less of a man.

I'd say it's getting better, but certain things still look at that old adage.  I mean, the consent movement is a great thing, but I've rarely ever seen male consent get talked about.  It's just assumed.  We're still behind the curve, but I'd say overall it's getting better."

"""believe it or not the woman I last killed asked me the *exact same thing*"""
"Body image issues. It may seem like guys are not dealing with them much, but it's mostly because we don't have s choice. If we voice them, it's usually mocked.    
A guy insecure about his dick size? Something to be laughed about. A guy taking steroids to get bulkier? Obviously a meathead. A guy wearing platform shoes? He has a complex. I don't think that women grasp how harshly male body image issues are brushed aside or openly mocked when you try to ask for help. 

The second insecurity would be just being unattractive and having no sexappeal. Really, girlfriend aside there's nothing to make me think that any woman is even the slightest bit interested in me. No compliments, nobody wants to talk to you, nobody wants to message you, conversations only happen if you initiate and even then they're often one-sided or straight unwanted.   
With that one I think men and women are on opposite ends of a spectrum. Women can't be left alone even if that's what they want (which is why women-only spaces are a thing), whereas many men can't talk to anyone even if they do want (which is why camgirls and, to an extent, prostitutes are a thing)."
"I got into minimalism. I downsized my wardrobe from 190 to 74 things, downsized my watch collection from 11 to 2 (soon to be 1), got rid of a bunch of other stuff, and decluttered 18 years' worth of stuff from my room back home.

It's really helped me move on from the past and recognize the power I have over my life in general. Plus the next time I move will be a lot easier, getting dressed is more efficient too cause I have less clothes to choose from, and I'm much more motivated to clean my apartment now."
"My mother is a nurse that works the night shift, while my father doubles as maintenance of public facilities and is a freelancing carpenter. Every day for 12 years, my father would wake up at 5 AM just to cook breakfast for my brother and I before we went to school, and go to work shortly after. Since my mom had to get rest at home to prepare to stay awake every night, it was our father who would always drive us to and from after school activities. I know it is just because of the timing of their jobs, but I have a lot of respect for my dad’s commitment to taking care of us."

"Take some kind of non-serious class or join a club if you're in college. 

Trying to pick up random people that are out shopping or that are working is generally not the best unless you're very charming and social. At least for me I have almost no desire to talk to strangers while out shopping, I just want to get done to move on to my next task. 

Meeting people in a club or elective class setting is inherently social and will give you more chances to talk to others that are there. You're also bettering yourself in some small way which is worthwhile even without finding a date. This kind of strategy works better at college ages with clubs, but I'm sure a local art class well offer similar opportunity to meet new people. 

Make sure whatever you pick you're interested in, and then you already have something in common with everyone in the room too! "

"I’ve hired over 500 people.  Most of them in a female dominated field.  Not one woman ever even asked for more money in the negotiation. Men almost always asked if there was room to be paid more. 

I always made sure the companies I worked for had a very structured pay formula to prevent women and men from getting paid differently.  The offer amount was always identical for everyone and carefully controlled.  It amounted to nothing because the women would never even ask.  

All people had to do was ask for more and I could always offer $3-$5k more on the spot without additional approvals.  

The only way I could have made the pay equal would be to tell women they should ask for more, which I’d get fired for and rightfully so.

"It’s quite easy. Whoever speaks money first loses. If you are ever asked what your number is. Always respond with that’s negotiable.  Never give your number out until the last interview. The company you’re interviewing at will certainly tell you what salary is for the position, once they give a number now you have the opportunity to counter, if you made it to the last interview this means they’ve exhausted their resources and lost money by taking these people out of their daily tasks, the company and people hiring you at this point will not want to start from square 1 with a new candidate since this will cost them even more money (the hiring process is really expensive). Now you have the advantage. The key is not to completely overshoot their number but always go slightly over the number you are aiming for, because more than likely they will counter with something lower, if they don’t then congrats now you got more than what you were expecting. The goal is to not leave money on the table while also not scaring the company away with a number so big they think you’re incompatible for the position or have a gross misunderstanding of the average pay for your position. 

Edits: spelling, was typing this on my phone while on the subway lol. 

Edit: feel like I should clarify that  you say salary is negotiable when they ask you for a number or state what the salary is for the position early in the interview process. For example if the recruiter says the salary is 40,000 for the position is that ok? You respond I don’t typically talk about salary this early on, salary is typically negotiable. You’ll either get an “oh ok” or “the salary is non negotiable.” If you get the ladder response and the salary is too low you know the job isn’t right for you and you can walk away early on in the interview process.

He might need help with acne if he gets it, he's gonna have to learn how to shave someday, and deodorant and body spray are going to become a thing. He might want help learning how to use gel in his hair or style it a different way. Helping him with these things will aid him in developing a positive self esteem and self image. "

"I honestly cant deal with mental health issues that aren't acknowledged and dealt with.

My ex bf of 10 years had some serious anger issues, insecurity, and anxiety and depression. He refused to get help, never worked, constantly thought about the past and eventually manipulated me into believing and feeling that I could have helped those things, that I could have made it better somehow. Not only is that inaccurate it's a soul crushing weight to carry and id never do it again. Ever.

"I've always found it weird that No Transgenders is controversial.  Like if you want kids of your own at any point, or even think you might, then no Transgenders is basically a given.

Edit:  Just editing since the post is locked, but a few things.

I thought it was implied, but when I say ""Kids of your own"", I meant kids that are biologically yours, so that means no adoption.

""But you can use surrogacy!"".  First, surrogacy is very expensive.  Second, while using a surrogate might mean the kid is biologically yours, MtF transgender women don't have ovaries or eggs, and FtM transgender men don't have sperm, so the kids could not biologically be your partners.  There are some means nowadays of taking mitochondrial DNA so the kid is technically 3 peoples, but it's new and, again, expensive.

""But some cis men and women are sterile!"".  That's true, but I never said whether or not I consider that a deal-breaker.  If I was really dead-set on being with a partner where we could have kids together that would biologically be ours, then it probably would be a deal-breaker."

He didn’t teach me much about what it means to be a man or socialize me that way and as a result, I was seen as effeminate by other boys my age. Even to this day although I taught myself healthy masculinity via the Art of Manliness, YouTube videos etc I still feel like an impostor amongst most conventional men as I’m not really into sport plus I’m sensitive and like to share my feelings.

The difference can't even be explained. The constant fear and anxiety is gone. And freedom! Monday I called someone up and made an hour drive to make them dinner and go out. No worry I'd be stranded. Pulled over.

"I've worked as a massage therapist and have some experience with different customers. Do you know what type of massage it is? Thai? Swedish?   
If you came to me, I would first talk to you about what you wanted, are you there to relax or do you have any specific issues like sore shoulders etc. It's your money, as a therapist I'm there to help you get what you need. 1 hour basically means enough time for full body, but if you want to put more focus on specific things that's ok.  
Then I'd ask you to undress and keep your underwear and lie down on the bench on your stomach, and I'd either leave the room or make sure you had privacy to undress. When you lie down I'd cover you with a sheet and ask if you had any questions or if you're ready. A basic full body routine should include back + neck, glutes, legs, feet, (turning to lie on your back), legs, stomach, arms, chest, neck, and if there's time scalp/face. If you're uncomfortable with any of these areas just say so, it's ok.  
  
Things to keep in mind:  
Keep your underwear on. Erections happen, it's not a big deal, don't worry about it. Don't ask for or joke about ""happy endings"", it's the offensive equivalent of ""oh it didn't scan, it must be free"" for cashiers.  
Just relax and enjoy it, no need to smalltalk during, but if there's anything you want to communicate, don't be afraid to let them know. Harder? More gentle? Does something tickle? Are you cold. Just say so, don't endure something because you want to be polite, the goal is to make you relaxed and feel good."

"I have naturally really thick legs. Like, not fat, but thick and muscular, especially in my thighs. I'm a stocky guy all around (my wife likes to say ""built like a brick shithouse"") and it runs in my mom's side of the family. All the dudes have Samwise Gamgee-esque physiques. Wide shoulders, average-to-short height, powerful leg strength.

So in high school I liked to wear super, super tight pants because I was really into punk music. Like, skin tight women's pants. Someone found a picture of me laying on the ground and posted it to a forum on Nexopia (throwback, lol) and the entire thread was people calling me ""thunder thighs"" and saying I was too fat to be wearing these jeans. I was far, far from overweight at the time; but my damn thighs gave that impression. 

A friend showed it to me and I think I laughed it off externally, but it did make me internally really upset. I *liked* how these jeans looked on me, I thought they looked really cool, and these total strangers on the internet had ripped away that self confidence. I threw those jeans out and just sort of carried on (and to be fair, the pants probably were a little bit too tight for me to be wearing), but it stuck with me and I felt like I had noone, as a male, to talk to about these insecurities. I didn't really get over it till I started seeing my wife, and she (very vocally) adores my body. 

Nowadays, I actually am overweight (deceptively so; due to my build, I carry my weight very well), and have been changing my eating habits and saving up for a gym membership to change that. But, oddly enough, I'm really secure in how I look, far more so then I was as a thoroughly healthy teenager. And, really, it's thanks to my wife. So I think that's how I dealt with body shaming; I married a woman who happens to be my biggest cheerleader and confidence booster, and who was willing to talk through these insecurities with me. I'm damn lucky!"

"Like 8. Me and a friend got busted for searching for porn on the school computers in second grade.

EDIT: Eh, until puberty starts you can't physically ~~have an orgasm~~ ejaculate (nor have you gained the hormones to stimulate masturbatory impulses), so that's when masturbation starts. Before then porn-watching is just curiosity. So you should be good until like 11. As for the rest, uh... like personally I never had ""the talk"" and never needed it, but I grew up with a support structure of friends and especially older friends who talked about that stuff around me which acted as a substitute. If he doesn't have that, he may need a talk.

EDIT2: I stand by what I said about sex-hormones not being produced until puberty. However, masturbation does still release oxytocin and dopamine before puberty, meaning kids can accidentally stumble upon masturbation and start early. This doesn't seem relevant to OP's question as it's different from ""sexual awareness"" in my opinion. Although it might affect the ""open door policy"" and might require a talk."

I noticed that for every worthwhile relationship there was a sucessful introduction from someone else. A reference if you will.

I'm sure if I had the confidence and charisma I could introduce myself. But I've never been successful on my own.

Instead every date I have has come from my social network exposing me to a new person.

It helps to go from a stranger who clearly wants a sexual relationship to so and so's friend who blah blahs.

The introducer can even help facilitate things by answering follow up questions from interested people. Basicly doing the flirting for you."

Wonder how a five year old looks as old as me
I told a gf I kind of liked the idea of her being dominant. It ramped up real fast and I decided I wasn’t as much into it when she was locking my cock into a chastity cage.
I wonder if this is due to nurture in the sense that women are often encouraged to be modest about their accomplishments: boasting isn't 'attractive or desirable' and this likely filters through to presentation and interviews and the like. (Not that this might not apply to men too.)

MY MAN
"To add to this, I was pretty much in the same situation as OP. Put my career above all else, ended up moving to a city where I had no friends. Cue mental breakdown. Routine is what saved me, specifically walking.
I would go out every night around 8PM, and just walk around my city for miles. At the end of it I felt like my mind was clear and I could focus on whatever my hobby was at home that week.
A side benefit was that I started noticing that I was getting noticed more. Apparently just walking and drinking water routinely can really cause you to lose some weight.
So yeah, walking. Go walk. :D"
"I was just in a situation like this. I had a pretty good job but my friendships were shallow and mostly consisted of me supporting others. I got little to no support from the people around me. Then my relationship of 6.5 years ended, and even the shallow friendships died. 

I kept working but 6 months later everything caught up with me. I started slacking at work and it felt like I was a zombie, just going through the motions. Eventually I realized my performance had dropped so much that either I was going to quit on good terms or get fired once my bosses paid attention to me.

In the end, I needed to get away. I had dug such a large hole for myself that if I stayed where I was, I would lean on the shallow crutches I already knew. So I decided to leave. 

I saved up some money, a few thousand. Easy enough to do with an okay job, I just ate cheaper and cancelled everything I could do without. Then I put in my notice, bought a nice camping bedroll, and threw everything I owned into a storage unit.

I drove around for a month. Drove 5000 miles, showered at Planet Fitness, called everyone I've ever known and stayed with each of them for a day or two. Tried to make deeper connections and really questioned the way I'd been living.

This is drastic, but if things are getting too bad, I suggest it. I don't know about you, but things got to a crescendo with me. Everything felt worthless and I even contemplated suicide seriously for the first time in my life. Thank god I got out before things got any worse.

tl;dr: reset your life with a different job and different people by taking a hiatus. "

"I'd put money on the fact that most guys have been horribly rejected in their life, like laughed at and mocked for trying which is probably why most guys just don't bother approaching women anymore or have no idea how to flirt.

He asked what kind of girls I was into, and I was trying to describe it to him, but for some reason he kept saying ""you mean fat girls???"" and I was pissed.

I finally just thought a second and realized our boss was actually a perfect example. So I said, ""Think more along the lines of Jill--she's exactly like I'm talking about.""

He got the biggest grin. ""So you like Jill?!""

""Well, I mean, yeah, she's really attractive.""

He went on and on about it and kept asking how she compared to my wife and making jokes and I just hoped it would be over. Except now every time we're talking to Jill he keeps glancing over at me and giggling.

She had no brothers, but obviously had a dad, and is around men as much as the rest of us, so I still don't understand how she came to the conclusion that men don't have feelings...or what she imagined men as. Like did she think there are humans of the male phenotype that walk around without emotions or any of the neuroanatomy or neurophysiology that causes emotion in women? 

Sorry Allison, but that's one of the most retarded, (and one of the weirdest, quite frankly), things I've ever heard."

Hmmm I wonder why men don't go into these fields.
"I've got a fun story about this...

The last time I did an interview, it was for an intern inspector job for a Civil Engineering outfit. The job would be to inspect contractors work, and reject it if it did not meet specifications. The first applicant came in and was slamming the questions out of the park like Babe Ruth attacking fastballs on Whiskey and cocaine so I decided to throw a curve ball... I took an aggressive approach. Sat forward, made direct eye contact and held it, talked softly, level but to the point... Every power move I knew, I used. My idea was that, this guy was hired, let's see how he would do under the pressure of a pissed off professional with over 25 years of experience. Needless to say the guy cracked.

Well, due to formalities of the outfit, I had to conduct the interview exactly the same with every applicant. I would pull back once they cracked, but I wanted to see if they could handle it. Every one broke down.. except for this one girl. Right out of highschool, smart, short, professional, nothing outwardly special. But once I played my hand it all came clear. That girl locked eyes and just gave it right back to me. It did not faze her at all. It was the strangest experience of my life, after playing the power game for years this 18 year old almost won that arm wrestle...

We hired her. She's still with the outfit. And she's great."

"Dating apps are trash. You're better off keeping your eyes open in public and taking the chance to get her number then and there if you think shes cute. Its the same thing as all these dating apps anyways. We swipe based on physical attractiveness. 

These dating apps are no better than job applications. Companies have a list of predetermined screens that they look for before they even email or call you back. Women have the same thing on these apps. Some might look for a certain height, a certain look, etc. 

You're better off yourself doing it in public.

Cute women tend to be in coffee shops, book stores, anywhere really. "

"Honestly, my female friends laugh a lot at my baldness. I think they don't think I mind cause I generally don't show offense and I joke around a lot (though never about people's appearances), but it hurts considerably more when they do it than when my male friends bring it up. "

"My wife hit me once when we were dating. I calmly told her I won't do it to her, and I expect the same respect. Hasn't done it since.

Edit: She was angry about something I don't remember (it's been over 13 years), but she came from a rough home and that's how they dealt with things. I'm just glad she was willing to commit to breaking that cycle."

"I did hiring for manufacturing. It wasn’t the most technical or even strenuous job on the planet.

However, when it came to office/ corporate jobs, women tended to be considered more highly. "
"My boyfriend and I met at his job (Discount Tire) after I had a blow out. Nothing happened that day, and I kicked myself for not saying anything to him because I felt instantly attracted to him. The following day by some freak accident my tire went flat and  I was dangerously close to having another blowout. I went back and he was there and he paced it to where he was the one that helped me in when I got to the front of the line. We hit it off from there :) worth almost dying twice?

"Yeah I mean context is important

If you guys talk pretty consistently and she takes 8 hours to answer once that's not a problem. But I still stand by the second and third. 

If she is like most people my age (20) she's on her phone a LOT and taking several hours to respond each time is a pretty clear sign."
"In college I ran a team of student IT-workers. Every year we needed to hire around 25-30 new people. There would be something like 5x as many men than women applying, but we hired the women at a far greater rate than the men. The women that actually applied were the ones that were passionate about the work and far more outgoing than the average men. Meanwhile I had countless men I couldn't pry more than 2 or 3 words out of in an interview. The less talkative women still tended to knock the technical questions out of the park. One year we literally hired every single woman that applied.

So the women were a highly self-selected group. Men just pounced on opportunities, and you know what? There were plenty of men that got in just because we had spaces that needed filling. If they didn't fuck something up horribly they were in good shape. And this was a fixed pay rate so they did just as well as the women in the end."

"I'm a girl but I wanted to jump in because this is a really interesting question. It really is just an unfortunate stereotype to assume it's always Daddy issues, because I've seen MANY Mommy issue cases.

I think the reasons girls might pursue men (or act out) more if they have a bad relationship with their mum could be some of the following:

1) Toxic mimicking: their mother was popular with men ""back in the day"" so they have been raised to believe their worth is defined by romantic experience/ party lifestyle.


2) Pay back: if their mother was super strict and kept them repressed, they will rebel and feel justified in doing so.


3) Guilt: if a mother is needy and wants to keep her daughter around she will feign physical/mental illness and warn her about how untrustworthy men are to keep her at home and single. This can also happen with men with mother issues. 


4) Bitterness: if a daughter grows up to be more like her father, the mother can push her away because she didn't get a carbon copy.

"Handshakes are so weird, like you never know what you'll get. As a man you're expected to have a firm one. I've had everywhere from heavy to very delicate handshakes from men. I have a firm but neutral handshake but between the varying degree I get beyond mine, I've had to recalibrate my handshake. It kinda throws you off, especially the really soft one. Women are super different, in my experience I've always got this scale. Slightly firm but neutral, delicate, limp, one touch (best example of this last one is like those side hugs). Women, in my experience tend to have an awkward time shaking hands."

"Honestly, if you have approach anxiety towards strangers, your best bet to meeting someone is through friends. The fact that there is already an established context for meeting removes a lot of the ""stranger"" factor. This is how I met (well, reconnected with) my now-wife.

Next best is through common-interest clubs (i.e. hiking, art, cooking, sports, etc) or Meetup groups, which is how I have met a number of friends post-college, as well as some potential romantic partners."

Dude .... He meant for next time. This way you don't climax you alternate before you climax.

"Yes, big differences. Some good some not good. Some understandable. Some regrettable. Mostly it's all commentary on our social immaturity. Most of this stuff is, I think, driven by gender norms and healthy and unhealthy stereotypes. 

With respect to job applications, raises, and promotions men will generally ask or demand a job they *could* do. Women will often try to reach a point of higher mastery in their own role, or ""fully start doing the new job"" before asking for recognition and compensation. 

It's a very much engendered approach where one takes what he wants and the other expects to get what she deserves. I won't say that I think one is good and one is bad, there are pros and cons to each. And some people — many people — won't fit into that stereotype. "

"Frankly this sounds like grooming.

Not saying this is a nail in the coffin, but of all the places he could have chosen to take a “platonic friend”, who also happens to be a minor female, why would he choose a dark movie?

"motivation is a crappy thing to rely on when it comes to changing something in your life. motivation comes and goes. 

just do it. do it when youre tired, do it when you dont want to, do it when you have the extra time and money and have made significant improvements. make it something you HAVE to do. make it automatic. 

you have to breath every second of every day. you have to eat at least everyday, you have to use the restroom once or twice a day. make the life improvments youre striving for, as automatic as those biological things. 

you have to wake up at 530 or 6am. 

you have to work out/go for a 30 min walk every morning

you have to meditate and value yourself everyday for 5-10 min.

you have to eat a healthy breakfast with protein and healthy fats. 

screw motivation, screw courage. dont just talk about it, BE about it. talk the talk but you also need to WALK the walk. 

its super easy for me to type this and think this and give advice but its super hard for me to take my own advice.. my excuse is that going through the divorce i dont have a set schedule for when i get my girls or if im picking them up or if shes picking them up. 

i should just wake up at 5 then right? do what i need to do, be finished with my morning routine by 7, and if she drops them off, cool, if i have to go get them, cool. 

yeah. ima do that. fuck all this noise. "

"I'm a big guy, always have been since I was a kid.  During middle School and high school, it became common for girls to ask me out, then mock me for my weight and looks when I'd say yes.

"Allow him to be himself.

Don't have a hidden list of expectations which you silently measure him against, looking for faults. And don't keep track of the mistakes he makes to use as ammunition. Love him for who he actually is.  If you want something from him, ask for it honestly. It doesn't matter if it's sex, support, time or a cup of coffee. Mind reading isn't proper communication, you have to say it.

You would be amazed how many women are in  relationships they think they hate because they spend their time judging their SO against invisible standards then emotionally battering them when they don't measure up. A man is a human being, not a project which you will finally love when they've made all the changes you require.

Love him for himself and he might just love you for you."

"Partially, though some studies show that men are more likely to be successful when asking for a raise/negotiating salary because women who do so are viewed as being too aggressive. 

It’s also not as simple as implying that women just somehow don’t know they should ask/are dumb for not doing so. Women are generally much more likely to just take what they are offered because they have been raised from childhood to be polite/demure/not cause a fuss. "
I’m curious what we are doing wrong exactly. Do we not ask for enough up front? Do we make the mistake of accepting the first counter-offer?

It's the thing you owned first, it's probably the last thing you will ever own and everything else you try and do will use your body in some way.

"A good father figure is pretty important, having a role model and someone to teach you right from wrong is something any person needs. 

My father wasn't the best, he didn't beat me or anything like this but didn't really spend time with me or talk to me. Initially I thought it was because he was working all of the time, but even on his days off, we never really bonded. This also meant that he never taught me anything or disiplined me when I misbehaved.

Thinking back on this, I think this contributed to my meekness, awkwardness and lack of confidence. 

Being a father myself, I try to do the opposite for my 2 yr old daughter, my wife and I talk with her all of the time, and we try to teach her as we spend time with her by reading books or explaining why she should or shouldn't do something. And what I've noticed, is that she is starting to pick these things up \*\*very\*\* quickly! For the most part she is well-mannered, confident and social (and shes ONLY 2 years old!). This is even more evident when we take her to the park and I see all these other kids throwing tantrums or pushing each other or not waiting their turn down the slide, whereas my daughter is patient and polite. I'm so proud of her.

In hindsight, I wish my father was more involved in my life, he worked and supported us, but I can't help but think that he couldn't have done more for me and my siblings. I rarely speak with him even on family occasions, at the very least, I have learned something from this experience and I'll be sure to do better for my own children."

But in my head is a never ceasing whisper of ""not good enough, not good enough."" The voice would be easier to ignore if I didn't agree with it.

My wife and I are going to be trying for kids this year. Will I be a good father? A good provider? Will I fuck this child/children up the way my dad fucked me up? How should I know? I've never done it before.

Not good enough, not good enough.

I'm making $15.50 an hour, around 600 a week with over time. I burned my savings account to the ground for the third time this year, doing stuff *she* wanted and needed. I know that 2019 is going to be expensive too. So what the fuck do I do? Work overtime, scrimp and save, find deals and grind out profit day by day? Only to find myself November of 2019 with fuck all in savings? With a baby on the way? How useful can I possibly *be* at this salary?

Not good enough, not good enough.

We have a home together. She's way better than me at household stuff. She already found she can't trust me to take care of tasks, so she needs to burn her own time and energy on upkeep. The lack of trust hurts, but not as bad as knowing the reason.

Not good enough, not good enough.

I have my own interests, my own passions, my own hobbies. If I focus on them, I burn time and energy that could have been invested in us, and I get to feel like a prick for being selfish. If I ditch them, I can contribute more, but I start breaking down from stress- wake up early, work all day, drive through rush hour traffic to get home, work on the home, shower and go to bed, over and over and over and over until I keep her awake at night with the grinding of my teeth. Then I break and do what *I* want to do instead of something useful, and we fall behind and I don't need her to guilt trip me because I can do it perfectly fine by myself.

Not good enough, not good enough.

She says I'll get better. She loves me without reservation, she loves me for who I am, she's mine and I'm hers forever. She trusts me completely and knows that I'm giving all I can and that it's enough for her.

I know deep down in my gut that I have the power to poison her love for me. All I need to do to ruin her is to stop trying. To stop being useful. To stop investing in us. Having power like that is like having a sword in my hand 24 hours a day. I have to step careful and watch every move to keep from sending someone to the ER.

Not good enough, not good enough."

"I'd love to see more mental health awareness. But not in the usual way of ""it exists"", but ""this is what it looks like"". At my university, a lot of students are burning out, or developing depression, or developing mental health issues... and they don't know it. They think it's normal to be ""a bit stressed"", joke about not being able to sleep or brag about working so much etc. And because men rarely openly talk about the issues they have, problems develop unnoticed in the background until they can not be ignored anymore.

I think the most effective way to combat mental health issues in a stressful environment like an university is to be wary of issues before you get weary of them.

I'd like to see education on the topic. It isn't normal to feel down and emotionless and unmotivated for weeks or a whole semester, it's not normal to not be able to sleep through the night without nightmares for months, it's not normal to go into classes with an aching stomach and lightheaded without knowing why, etc etc.

This is what would have helped me, at least. "

I wanted to die last year. I wanted to fucking kill myself. I was going to do it. I had a plan. I was going to take a dive off a parking garage. I didn't do it. Something would always get in the way or I'd put it off another day - ( too lazy to kill myself lmao) or I'd say to myself man you're fucking over your family and idk shit just worked out for me and I'm where I'm at today and my life's 110% different and I'm happy but fuck I got lucky with opertunities and good people that loved me. But I also changed my perspective got sick of being worthless and not actually going for opportunities. No one did that for me. Everyone thought I was crazy and weird for swimming so much until I got the beach lifeguard job. I wanted to be better and shit just worked out

Edit: also want to say 2018 was the year I realized I have a gaming addiction and stopped playing games. Used them as an escape. Better than being addicted to crack but still sucks having waisted a lot of my teenage years"
"Or drunk blowjobs. Fuck that. You’re drunk. You want to play with your dick. You know you aren’t going to cum. Quit trying to fool yourself.

They are about equally bad at being self aware as men are. 
It's important for all kids. Because your girls will be horny and needing their room to masturbate too.
"Around 7-8ish, I found my uncles porn stash and watched it. I was confused at first but then I started to copy the guy masturbating and then I couldn’t stop. I became really addicted to it but I still hadn’t developed feelings for girls. It was net until I was 12 that my dad walked in on me, he laughed and said we needed to talk, he told me to calm down and that I wasn’t in trouble. He told me it’s completely normal but not to do it to much otherwise I might hurt myself. I sure as hell felt embarrassed but it felt good knowing I wasn’t a weirdo lol.

As for any psychological damage? No nothing really, although in the beginning when I first started I was self conscious about my penis size since the guys in the video had fucking arms between their legs and I began to try stretching out my penis lol. But around 10 I realized that my thing will grow, and now I am a happy adult.

Should you talk to him about it? 
I would say eventually yes but let him discover himself a bit first, (of course I’m speaking from my own personal experience) there was this comfort I felt knowing I was experiencing this myself and trying to figure out my own anatomy. A way you can bring it up to him would be to address it in a general statement that way he still has his privacy, kind of like saying “ oh you’re almost 10yr now and it’s time for the talk” something of that caliber were it feels it’s natural for him to start feeling this way but not let him know you know about his masturbating.

"It's hard to overstate how much walking can turn one's life around. My current self embraces walking (eventually turned into walking + running), but my past self would've just scrolled past this comment. So I'm paying it forward by saying...

**YOU! Yeah, you!** This one is for you: the guy who's been given a tough break all-around, the guy who's reading this post in the future because life feel like it's in shambles. Hear me out. Now that I've got your attention, I just want to refute what you might be thinking: 

*Walking? Seriously? That's so cliche, it doesn't help me burn calories, I don't have time in the morning, I'm too tired from work at night, the weather sucks, it's too dark, my shoes aren't comfortable,...* 

SHUT DOWN ALL THESE EXCUSES and get your sorry ass out there! Walking is the most basic physical activity for all of humanity. You can go search all the studies on fitness about it, but you don't even need to know all that to embrace how much it does for your mental health. 

The air, the movement, the complete control over pace and walking route...even just *5 minutes* a day *consistently* will get you priceless endorphins that give you a clarity to turn the rest of your life around. And the more you do it, the more you'll *want* to do it, and the benefits go exponential after that! After several days of very, very gradually increasing my time every day, 30 minutes of walking in the morning was all it took for me to seize the rest of my day. Without walking, I'd still be wallowing around in my own inactivity and feeling like my life was falling apart.

So when all else is lost, take a Walk! :)

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! And you, dear reader, if you're still reading: spend a little more time walking and little less time on Reddit :p"

"&gt;No fats

But just 4 months ago you said this:

&gt;With so many fat women, at this point I have to accept a fat woman or have my chances at having a relationship drastically cut.  It especially affects me personally because I'm short, so the thin women could generally do better than me(keeping it real), and fat women don't particularly want me either, for the same reason I don't want them; They don't like being bigger than me/I dont like being smaller than them. 

So which is it? Is fat a deal breaker or not?

Unrelated, but I am curious about your own physique; what I've noticed is that many of the most vocal objectors (a la or /r/fatpeoplehate) are usually skinny-fat themselves.

As for mental illness, a lot of it is not recognized for women at all and very slow to be treated. ADHD is a common example, as are the different ways anger issues and anxiety manifest in women. Most of the discrepancy comes from men not seeking mental health services (they have a bigger stigma) and their partners stepping in as de facto therapists. "
"That one has always annoyed me. The old stupid quote, ""men are afraid women will reject them, women are afraid men will kill them.""

"When I was single, there were a few dealbreakers. I dated a lot but, didn’t date exclusively as I didn’t want a serious relationship.


I wouldn’t date a woman who had kids because I didn’t feel I was in a position to be a positive influence due to the elaborate lifestyle I lived at the time. 


I also wouldn’t date anyone who would use drugs in front of me or bring drugs into my home, or anyone who would try to bully anyone into agreeing with their views whatever those views might have been.


I wouldn’t date someone who didn’t drink or who was in recovery because my lifestyle would only have derailed their efforts.

Go to dinner at a new restaurant. Go see movies neither of you have heard of. Go to the driving range, or the bowling alley. Treat it like you're still trying to impress her with a fun time. It's worth the time, money, and effort to keep your shared experiences fun and novel."

"A lot of men don't realise they're suffering. They think it's just they need to try harder, or the world's unfair, or their girlfriend's a bitch, or something *anything* external.


The idea that it's their emotions and reactions that are out of whack and not the world as a whole doesn't even cross their minds.


You need to reach those men. The men who don't use free healthcare because there's people who need it more, the men who stay late at work because otherwise someone else picks up the slack, the men who don't want to be helped in the first place. These guys are out there coping by getting drunk with their buddies or by binging anime or by wanking themselves into oblivion, not self-harming or going catatonic or sleeping around like women do. 


I'd say the best mental health campaign for men isn't framed as a mental health campaign at all. Make it seem like talking through their feelings is doing someone else a favour, and gradually work up to letting them be vulnerable. IDK"

"I'm still in the turnaround, but I'm eyeing up 2019 as the year everything falls into place. In the past two years, I've:

* Separated from my (ex) wife
* Lost custody of my son
* Left a job because it was sucking my soul out through my asshole
* Got evicted from the house I rented after moving out when I had no job
* Spent two months effectively homeless (living in cheap motels/my car)
* Lost my car because I couldn't afford to keep up with maintenance and the transmission went

For me, I think the biggest step was taking a big leap of faith and moving to a new city where I didn't know anyone and could effectively start with a blank slate. Since then, I've made a lot of really good friends, recently got a new girlfriend who's been a HUGE help in bringing more positivity into my life, and I've started to pay off debt that's been looming over my head for some time.

Today was the first day in a long time where I woke up feeling completely at ease with my situation in life, even though there are still a lot of things that I'm struggling with (not seeing my son very often, mostly).

Not a deal breaker though. Just a preference. 

I’m also on the fence about girls who have experienced some form of emotional trauma that they have trouble coping with. I’ve dealt with that a couple times, and it can be emotionally taxing. I’m busy and often stressed as is, so I don’t want to add one more thing to worry about.

Personally, I don't think the observed effect is due to innate differences in men and women, but rather it's because of differences in how men and women have been raised to present themselves and take risks.  

Ironically, they wouldn't publish the paper, but by doing so and creating a controversy, they caused many more people to see it than otherwise would have. 

Edit I can't find the original news article about the controversy but I'll edit to update it if I can find it. There's probably a mention of it somewhere in the wiki page. "

"I'm gonna be real with you. Age doesn't definite maturity well. Hardships create it. People who haven't suffered, will usually act like children unless they have great introspection. People who have had it rougher, will mature quicker. Usually as you grow up, you encounter more difficult things that force you to mature. But it mostly depends on how much you've been challenged in life. "
That we can deal with emotional trauma and upsetting situations (like bad breakups and the like) with ease. And that showing sadness or crying makes you less of a man.

"In college, I drove a girlfriend of mine to her apartment after bar close one night. When we arrived, we smoked a bowl, and she quickly fell asleep next to me on the couch. I sat there and watched TV for a bit. Her two roommates came in a bit later, and one of them grabbed Olivia (my friend) and took her upstairs to her room. The other roommate began interrogating me, asking how I know her, and what I’m doing here. I answered all of her questions. I grabbed my things and on the way out the roommate said, “Thanks for not raping her.” 

I was so confused that I turned and said, in a low to high voice inflection, “You’re welcome?”. 

In my car I started stirring over that. I acted like a gentlemen and did nothing wrong, but just because I’m a man and she didn’t know me, I’m a rapist. Haha. Bitch.

But all that came out was ""No, these are my kids, I don't babysit"" She said she wasn't trying to offend and I told her that she should be more respectful of a fathers role in their kids lives and left.  


She probably felt that I was being rude, but I honestly HATE the stigma against fathers and childcare.  


And dont get me started on how my wife is offered help at every corner to take care of the kids(which she is incapable of doing and she isnt employed) but I work full time, and keep the kids full time and I've just got to ""figure it out"" This woman gets a full ride from everyone in her family, I moved away from my family and have been on the receiving end of emotional abuse for years and somehow I'm wrong for wanting a divorce.

This is spot on. 90% of the problems I've had in long term relationships is because I can't digest what I'm feeling at the moment. Takes me a while to process, so if I don't answer immediately to inquiries, it's not that I'm unsure about her, but that I just don't have an answer yet."

"I never once thought about it from the male perspective until about 10 years ago when I was a dating a guy (who had a super high libido) that complained that when he wasn’t in the mood women took it personally.  It got me thinking, if he is getting crap for that, how much are guys with average to low libidos dealing with?  I started examining things like that from the male perspective and realized how fucked up society’s messages to both genders are.

I agree there is still a lot of room for improvement in regards to male consent, but at least they are starting to talk about it now.  When I was a teen it was basically “Guys always want sex, girls might enjoy it but probably won’t, but it’s expected in a long term relationship.  Now don’t do it until you are married.”  Nowadays they acknowledge different sexualities (including asexuality and it being ok to not want sex) and teach safe sex for all gender combinations.  It really highlights how messed up the old teachings were.

I know the teachings aren’t that progressive everywhere; I can only speak for the high school my kid attends.  Things are changing, and it’s for the better."

"Here's an anecdote to echo what others have said.

I work in mental health. When I was in graduate school, one of my internship roles was co-facilitating a group for adult men convicted of domestic abuse.  By far the strongest common thread between all of the men (in total about 40 of them) was lack of male role models. Nearly all of them were raised by single mothers who had a string of partners without a long-term relationship (noone filling the step-dad role, legally or otherwise).  There were two exceptions. One of the men's parents were married but dad worked 80 hour weeks at minimum and was traveling for months at a time during the man's childhood and adolescence. One of the men's parents stayed married but dad was frequently violent toward mom and kids. 

Going in, I would have expected most of them to be like that last guy, following a model they had been exposed to at a critical age. Turns out that wasn't the norm at all. It was the absence of a role model to teach or to discuss what it means to be a man. Left to figure it out for themselves, the men in my group had only pop culture reference points for masculinity, which tended to include a lot of hard drinking, emotionally mute, aggressive authoritarian dickheads.  To somewhat stretch for an analogy, they didn't have anyone to show them what John McClane looked like at home, after the villains have been defeated and the world saved.

I once tried to share this observation with a friend, and I must have done a poor job, because she took me to be saying ""single moms are the cause of domestic abusers"" so let me reiterate that it isn't that.  Absent role models for masculinity, in a culture whose background noise screams on a billion-times-daily basis that men must learn to be ""real men"", these guys knew they had to become SOMETHING but they didn't know what and they didn't know how, so they desparately scrambled for whatever guides they could find, and it led them way off course into being miserable adults who mistreated others: hurt people hurting people.

Men are several times more likely to be diagnosed with autism, to the point that it discredits the diagnosis. The argument goes (not unjustifiably), that there's no such thing as mild autism, and that (mostly female) primary school teachers are just pathologizing masculinity out of ignorance/sexism.

There's also the theory that that's what autism \*is\*. Just an extremely masculine brain functioning normally. Personally? I'm not convinced, but I don't know enough about neurobiology to refute it."
