"Happy to be of service ;)

Honestly feel like I should repost this where people will see it, but idk where that is. Sexual communication tips are a much needed public service.

"Right now just a protein shake or snack in the morning (shake for weekdays, something small on weekends or nothing), and then dinner. Fridays nothing until after work, then some food later in the evening (is free).

Right now that's me dieting, but when I'm not dieting I still tend to eat pretty similarly, just more freedom for snacks and not as restricted on dinner portions. Sometimes 2 meals on weekends if eating out (one meal in place of the light snack)."

I also play basketball and free weights at least 2 times a week.

Whil I 'know' theres nothing wrong with crying, I still look down on myself when I have a hard time controlling it and I look at men as being weak when they do.  Again, I know its wrong and I really dont think theyre weak or theres anything wrong with it...I just really hate the idea of not being in control of your emotions.  "

"I'd want to know before the first date, there'll be plenty of opportunity for her to inform me while going through the pre-meet texting. That way I'll have a much more realistic idea of her availability and be more able to understand why a new relationship will be a bit less of a priority for her than a woman without dependants. I guess it would just help me make a better decision about things and set my expectations appropriately."
"I think this logic extends past just the sending of dick pics. I think this misunderstanding is the source of a lot of the negative attention women get from men. Men are just treating women the way that the men want to be treated, and men translate the actions of a woman through ""the golden rule"". I think it's why you get the victim blaming and the claims that a woman asked for it by the way they dress. Guys see women with low cut tops and short skirts (bringing attention to sexual parts of the body), and they interpret that type of outfit as a signal that the women are DTF. Why? Because if a guy puts his sex organ on display in a comparable way, he is sending a strong message about what he's after.

Women aren't men though. Women don't want to be treated like men want to be treated."

"Yes! Some guys get toothy. I actually thought I didn’t like it at all for quite awhile. 

First thing I’d say is that the high points are the same. Your enjoyment of it is paramount. Eye contact is good. Everyone is different. The question marks are similar too. Personally teasing and kissing and touching other parts of my body makes it a more whole experience, but some people’s insecurities or dominance preferences make them dislike it. I like it when someone makes pleasure sounds and tells me how much they love it. Some don’t. Important stuff to know: does she like more focus on the clit/hood, does she prefer vaginal stimulation, or is a combo what works best? Fooling around with the labia minora doesn’t really do it for most people, guys. Does she like getting some over the panties stuff first? Nipple play? Gentle, aggressive, or combo? Fast, slow, or combo? Steady rhythm or free form? Some stuff that I *think* is pretty safe to say across the board: don’t let your tongue go completely soft and just mash it around in there. It doesn’t do anything. Also don’t point the tip of your tongue and press in hard. There are a lot of nerves there and this hurts. It also hurts to rub your dry finger across the clit. Think about how friction feels for you and then magnify the shit out of it. It’s unpleasant. One thing about women is that we’re (a lot of us anyway) conditioned to make sounds that can mislead you on how much we’re enjoying it. It’s a hard habit to break. Pay attention to facial expressions, weird sounds, muscle twitches, goosebumps, involuntary stuff. Ask. Questions. Be attentive. For me I need the person to move back and forth between being sensual and affectionate and being aggressive and in charge. Make me cum again when I don’t want to anymore, and be extra sweet after. But again, everyone is different. I noticed that I tend to make out in the way that I like someone to go down on me, so consider that as a possible indicator, but I have no idea if other people do this. Good luck to you!"

When I was younger I drew a anime MILF onto a piece of paper with her ass taking up most of it and just a bit of her breasts showing while she was looking back.

When I released my goods I had the best orgasm up to that point it was unreal.  So that was the time I had sex with a piece of paper.

Yeah that's where I knew she was getting at but there's also a good chance that a good looking guy gets wayy better reception and results from being that straight forward than an ugly guy even with consideration to rejection. The ugly guy would get a hard no be ridiculed or ghosted and rejected whereas the better looking guy would get a soft no and still be a viable option for later.

Jokes aside, I don’t follow this line of thinking for no reason. It’s been beaten into my head my many friends and acquaintances that that’s something blatantly disrespectful to do, no matter how it’s done or how much sense it doesn’t make, and I can’t help but think that way.

The biggest issue that I see is that what constitutes “straightforward” and “disrespectful” isn’t universal. Some want you to use the term “sex” explicitly, some don’t want to hear the word at all, sometimes the most you can do is hint at everything (“I don’t want anything serious”, which could mean just casual sex or it could mean you just want to be friends), and some just get pissed off regardless of how it’s done. Shits frustrating tbh. 

Maybe I just live around particularly conservative women (lol Bible Belt), but this train of thinking seems to persist even among my “progressive” friends. In fact, it’s actually most common amongst them tbh"

(Other redditers reading this - don't act like you don't too...)"

"Obviously dating and sex will be easier for anyone who is physically attractive. But good looking men do get rejected for being jerks, maybe not bu ever girl, but by every girl that has some self respect. 

So, are you saying I should only date men I'm not attracted to? Because there are many flaws in that thinking. First of all, you're assuming I'm only attracted to very stereotypically attractive men, but that's not the case. You're also assuming that all good looking men are asshole, and less attractive men are never assholes, also not true. Also, the last man I dare was a guy I wasn't very attracted to. I dated him because he was sweet at first, and we had a lot in common. Even he started to exhibit some disrespectful behavior, and I had to break up with him for various reason. I felt like a cunt because I may have lead him on even though I tried to be honest. So it's really really not as black and white as you think things are."

You could replace human being with “person” you sound like a robot when you talk. This advice is only applicable for attractive folks as honesty is good and all but when it comes to getting laid you need to be good looking in combination with that hell to even get success in dating you need to be somewhat attractive. 
Being able to jump into bed with a FWB really helped getting through a nasty breakup. We weren't compatible for dating but still cared for each other as friends (and had a great time getting each other off) and I needed both of those things then.

"When I was about 15 or 16 I put my dick into one of my parents condoms  (as I couldn't get my own) to see if it'd fit (I assumed they were like a ""one size fits all kinda thing)

"The best thing in life is living in the moment.  People seek it all the time.  My favorite is a dangerous situation where your life and well being depends on total concentration and impeccable decision making.  Other people meditate or practice mindfulness.    Living in the modern world is about scattered awareness, you wouldn't survive without having that, a million distractions and quite of few of them are important to keep checking in on.  I think someone from a more simple society would be freaked out at how many things they have to be aware of to navigate a city safely.  But we take it all in as a matter of course.

If you're only looking for casual sex I'd say the only option is being up front about it. If you're rejected by someone that finds that disrespectful, then I guess you'd just have to move on to the next one. Every woman is going to take things differently.

"The retail trap is real and unless you literally know a guy with power for tangible advancement who isn't leaving the company anytime soon or you are said ""guy"", in a lot of ways it's not worth the time grinding away. It shouldn't be seen as a place for the long haul.

 Especially with retailers in general being in rough shape, those plug and play, be here for 10+ years, get to higher levels of corporate and secure the easy 6 figure district manager gigs where you literally just check up on stores in your region, can move around anywhere in the country and have a lot of the physical leg work on someone under you, sort of jobs just don't really exist anymore. A lot of the older fuckers aren't retiring in numbers like they used to, it's cheaper to condense responsibilities to one guy for less pay instead of paying multiple people  and it's extremely easy to cap out hardcore.

Now yes obviously if you're in a position where you can't afford to be picky, retail is better than thumbing your ass broke at home, but it's not a place to carve out a career due to how  arguably the skills are only going to translate in one particular place.

"Not exactly... the usage of social stuff like that is indicative of what people lack irl, not what people like or don't like. Girls have an abundance of one-night stands available to them irl, so they don't seek them out on social media because they don't have to, as they can get one at any time. They don't, however, have a relationship available to them at all times irl, so they seek that out on social media. The lack of girls seeking one-night stands on social media is not indicative of their opinion of one-night stands. Additionally, views of one-night stands are varied across the spectrum, so I'm not saying all girls like one-night stands. Not all guys like one-night stands, either. So I'm saying, just simply, that girls in general like one-night stands just as much as guys, in general, like one-night stands. It's worth mentioning that the taboo placed on girls would skew the ""statistics"" on social media, because a girl doesn't want to be viewed unfavorably by society (not my views, but a lot of people think that way) so she would avoid any characterization that she enjoyed one-night stands for fear of being perceived as a whore. I consider myself a ranking expert as the dude all my girlfriends were comfortable talking about this stuff with (read: the friend zoned guy). I mean... to prove my point... every guy who has a one-night stand with a girl has to have a girl have the one-night stand with him. Proving that just as many girls like one-night stands as guys, as they both have to be present for one to happen. "

Call at his name ON YOUR WAY to his room. Then yell at him to acknowledge you when you call him so you know he doesn’t have air pods in lol
"Thanks guys, love the support.

For context, my mum was helping with the local fete in my school. Families with older kids donate their old toys to the fete where younger kids can purchase them at a low price. Money goes to charity. The place my mum and the other volunteers helping put the toys was full so my mum offered to take some. That ""some"" ended up in my room.... And you know the rest."

"Some things in life are bad,

They can really make you mad,

Other things just make you swear and curse,

When you're chewing life's gristle,

Don't grumble,

Give a whistle

And this'll help things turn out for the best.

And...


Always look on the bright side of life.

"I was actually feeling incredibly relaxed. The whole trip was the most enjoyable and hassle free thing I've done in years. I knew she was going to say yes (I mean, she chose the exact stone she wanted when she deduced I was designing her ring) so there wasn't any ""will she or won't she"" jitters. We'd been together 10 years already, at that point you're pretty much in each other's heads anyway. So there was nothing to worry about, just a lot of nice things to enjoy.

Good luck!"

"Shit balls you're right. My bad, guys."
Even a brief perusal of /r/lolgrindr shows the truth about gay dudes - we love dick pics but also culturally love to pretend we’re sick of being sent random dick pics. Fortunately we’re the only ones who have to deal with our own bullshit.
