"I was on a Skype for Business conference call at work, and was on mute. I let loose a glorious fart, further enhanced by the acoustics of spandex underwear and a wooden chair.

I was not on mute. Furthermore, because no one else was talking, it showed me as the active speaker and my picture for the next 5-10 seconds so everyone knew."
"I worked at a Satellite company, in one of the higher Tiers of Support in the Call Center. I can give as many discounts as I want, as long as it was justified. There were times my boss wasn't happy, but oh well, it was a shit job. 

I've become very jaded to every sob story there is out there. These stories usually come about when they start talking about their bill, ""Uh huh, I'm sorry your husband suddenly got Alzheimer's and you lost your hand in a sewing accident, no, you still owe the $75 for porn. No ma'm, it wasn't free.""

Anyway, when people are nice, I try to offer them things as a courtesy. This lady was very polite, trying to get her TV working. Our troubleshooting didn't work, We needed to roll a truck out to her home. 

""Truck will be $45. Do you accept?""

""I accept.""

""Cool, let me confirm your information...""

I was gathering the information, she was calm and collected throughout. I felt like being a ""generous"" person and I waived the truck fee, because why the fuck not. 

She started crying. 

She broke down, told me her husband has cancer. The only thing he can do is watch TV and is otherwise sedentary. Having him without his TV will drive him mad. The $45 will pay for the gas she needs to drive to the hospital for his treatment, which is an hour and a half drive just to the hospital. She thanked me profusely, over and over again. I had to take a break after that phone call. 

Oh, and suddenly that guy got his TV free for an additional three months, cause fucking hell."
"I let a stranger on a train borrow my cell phone. He used it for a long time, calling so many different people, that I thought I was on a hidden camera TV show. Well over 30 min. Finally he gave it back and got off the train.  A short while later, I got a phone call from a random number. It was one of his family members. He had just used my phone to say goodbye to his love ones, and he was planning on killing himself. I told the lady which train stop he got off at.  She called me later that night to say they found him alive, and that there aren’t many good people on earth, like me. I was just blown away, and happy they found him safe. 

"
I definitely notice that they are wearing clothes.
"Freshman year of college a rather good looking girl was sitting on my dorm room bed at 2am, peeling the wrapping off of a plastic bottle. She then said, ""Did you know that people who peel the wrapping off of bottles like this are sexually frustrated?"" 

My reply was, ""Huh. You learn something new everyday.""

She left, and I would go on being a virgin for a little while longer. 

Edit: typo"
"Back at university, a friend of mine wanted to study for a semester abroad in Sweden. But all exchange places were taken by other students so she applied to go to Spain instead. A couple of days later, I had coffee with another friend who told me about someone he knows cancelling his semester in Sweden. So I passed that information to friend No. 1 who called the exchange office and asked if she could go to Sweden in his place.

Today, she lives in Sweden and is married, with a child.

I literally changed the course of life for that person by having coffee with another person.

Freaks me out every time I think about it."
"it pisses me off too. i think it really just comes from the fact that they see other people do it, so they do it, then other people see them do it so they do it etc

it pisses me off when i'm trying to have a chill night in with my girlfriend and somebody is saying bullshit like ""fuck that, just tell her you have better things to do and you're going out""

no dude, this is the better thing. i *like* spending time with my girlfriend."
Don't act like you don't know what a potato is.

I am learning jujitsu. My instructor physical contacted the hell out of me. 
"A buddy of mine sat on his balls in the pub one night. I spent about 5 minutes making fun of him, went to the bar for drinks, came back and sat on my balls. 

Edit: Lots of dudes in the replies feeling smart because they have never sat on their balls. The day is coming guys, and I want you to picture my face when it does. Picture my face, right on your balls. "
"Thought I was alone in the back room at work so I decided to pick the annoying booger out of my nose instead of getting a Kleenex like a grown man. 

Co-worker came around the corner when I was somewhere between one and two knuckles deep. I stood there frozen like the busted child I was, not daring to remove my finger in fear of exposing the nast I was trying to expel from my nostril. 

I panicked and just said, “Hi, Barbara.” Finger still in and all. She just sorta stared for a second and continued walking past. We never mentioned the incident again, but after 10 years, my anxiety likes to cripple me with this memory."
I typically have to look down to remember what ***I'm*** wearing.
"1st grade. A kid fell down near my desk and bumped his knee. For whatever reason he told the teacher I tripped him. She put my name on the board with a check mark next to it. All the while I'm sitting there like ""I didn't even do anything!"""
I once was doing some manscaping in my parents bathroom over their toilet. It was my first time doing it so there was a fuck ton of hair. I forgot to flush my toilet and my parents made fun of me for a week lol.
"I had a condition that needed adult circumcision.

The doctor told me to keep my dick as clean as possible so I didn't... do the daily activity of a few days.

While getting the cut and suture my gun went to life and fired everywhere. It was the weirdest sensation with all the feelings removed because of the medication. I could feel the spasm of my muscles around that area, and I know the nurse dabbed my pelvis and stomach to remove... the liquid. 

There were like a doctor and maybe three nurses. They quietly just mopped it up and continued like nothing happened. I'm so glad I would never have to see their faces again. "
"Like, six years. Your first love is always the toughest to get over, man.

"A drunk coworker accidentally grabbed my crotch trying not to fall down while dancing a few days ago, does that count?"
"Okay I have met my fair share of fathers and I now have daughters of my own. So looking at this from both end I'd have to say I have a few simple rules.

1. Don't be afraid to say you don't know something. In casual conversation with a chilled out dad or in a borderline interrogation with a father from hell, the rule is the same. Admitting you don't know something shows respect, humility and gives you a chance to show you are interested to learn and grow yourself. 

2. Share you interests and take part in theirs. If he wants to show you his motorbike, car, bar, wine collection, model trains, etc. Show interest, ask questions, be involved! If he asked you a question, answer as you would if your best friend asked you. This builds a relationship where you understand each other and he sees you as a person, not the next dropkick that wants to get in his daughters pants and move on. 

3. Speak with conviction and respect. This isn't a job interview where you tell the person everything you think they want to hear. Let him see that you are a man, not a 25 year old man-child.

4. Understand that this isn't easy for him either. This man has spent a massive portion of his life overhauling everything that he is in order to provide a loving and caring life for his child. He has sacrificed and hurt deeply in order to help shape what he sees as the most beautiful thing on this earth. His daughters firsts are his firsts too and this may be the first one of these conversations he's ever had. 

Just remember that you and your girlfriend are developing a relationship that has inherit risk. It's a beautiful thing, but it's also dangerous. If he seems nervous about you it's because he doesn't know you and you can't trust what you hold dearest with someone you don't know. What you break he has to pick up. Treat her respectfully and all will be well. 

Bonus rule: Don't get to the house and then realise you had a one nighter with your girlfriends sister... That's just an awkward Sunday dinner you don't need.

"I was assaulted on the bus, bashed repeated in the head with a math book when I tried to stand up to a bully.

As a kid I got my dick caught in my zipper. Still have a scar from it. Never went commando again.
"I was vaccuming a pool with a pool vaccum and I started pulling it out while it was still on (easier to drain it if it’s in shallow water). Then it attached itself to my left testicle through my boardshorts and I genuinely thought I was going to be castrated by a fucking pool vacuum.
 
Edit:Some people are rightfully confused. I live in Australia and it get really fucking hot so instead of standing out of the pool and guiding the vaccum with a pole, I don on a scuba mask and guide it with my hand(s). Also, holy shit thats alot of upvotes."
"In college. I had just figured out that I wouldn’t be able to graduate in 4 years. I had to be there an extra year. I took a good look in the mirror and said “You’re not even wasting college doing cool shit, like partying your ass off. Your wasting college cause your lazy and pathetic.” So I decided that the pain of being a failure was worse then the pain of working your ass off. And then I went into maximum overdrive."
Some people you never really get over.  
Held my crush's hand when we were at an amusement park because the crowd was ridiculous at a certain section and I didn't want us to lose track of each other. 
I pet a dog once.
"My girlfriend is on the phone with her cell provider, trying to fix a billing error.

I walk in the room to listen, and let out a loud, but brief fart.

Cell guy: ""Oh, you have a big dog, eh?""

Girlfriend: ""Nope. Just a cat.""

Cell guy: ""Oh.... That's a big bark for a cat.""

Cue me trying to laugh as silently as I can, while my girlfriend hits me."

I pulled an all nighter and I was hanging out in the history library with the history club at my campus. The club is mostly girls and I ended up falling asleep in a chair. I popped a boner when I was sleeping and I got woken up by a bunch of girls giggling and laughing at me. 
"I went one step further.. I stood on top of a paper towel while I was trimming. Promptly rolled the paper after I was done and for some reason my idiot brain decided to throw it out of the window like I was scoring a basket.

It landed right on the deck where my father and brother were sitting. My dad's look at me screamed all the synonyms of idiot."
"My grandfather (father’s side) passed away years ago on Christmas morning at 3 am. 

I went outside for some reason at my Grandmother’s place (mother’s side), I can’t remember why but I remember feeling the need to immediately go outside. 

My father was outside, alone, crying his eyes out at the loss of his father. I remember being petrified - I had never seen him cry before. I sat with him for a minute, and all I could manage to say was “Dad, I’m really proud of who you are”. I don’t know why I said it, or the context - but my father immediately grabbed me and we cried together. 

Years later, he told me that was a defining moment for him - a moment he realized what being a father was about. I still to this day don’t quite understand how or why what I said triggered this for him, but it’s a Father-son moment I’ll never forget. 

He will never read this - but I love you, Dad. You are my best friend and my rock, and I appreciate everything you have done for me. 


Edit:   Welp, I figured this would be a buried venting comment but I’m pretty overwhelmed by how kind everyone is. This time of year is hard for me and my family, and I greatly appreciate all of y’all for the incredible comments and PM’s. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t teared up a few times today because of the comments here. "
"I hear that too, my wife is my favourite person to hang out with. Doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy my friends, I just enjoy her more."
Huh. You learn something new every..- OH MY FUCK..
"I was like 13 or 14 and I came home from school one day, went into the bathroom, sat on top of the toilet and started going to wank town (life is stressful at that age, ok?) I didn’t realize it because I was busy exercising this new ability of mine, but my foot was against the door, skate shoes still on, causing it to knock in the frame. It sounded like a miniature version of a headboard knocking against a wall during sex. To my abject horror, Mom comes by and yells ‘what’s going on, are you all right?’ I stammer out, ‘I.. I’m... I’m kicking the door, ok?!’ as if that makes any sense at all. We never spoke of it again, but I knew she knew.

I told my friend this story and he now calls jerking off ‘kicking the door.’"

"9th grade I decided my face was dry so I grabbed some of mom’s moisturizer. Woke up the next morning, looked in the mirror... yeah, it was moisturizing tanning lotion.

"I don't notice if they are wearing clothes, but I assume they are because I would definitely notice if they weren't wearing clothes."
"It's not just men.

I'm the only man on my team at my job. When my co-workers talk about their husbands or kids 90% of the time it's complaining and talking about how their husbands don't help around the house, help with the kids, do anything romantic etc.

They often tell me how lucky that I am to be single and live alone and how they wish their husbands would travel more, take the kids and just leave them alone.

Sure it might just be venting but I don't understand how regularly trashing your partner publicly can be healthy for a relationship."

"Was out of state doing some shopping in my girlfriend's hometown, when I got a text from one of my best friends. He'd been going through a rough time for almost a year at that point, and I've been trying to just help him out any way I can, whether that's talking to him everyday or spending time with him when I can. I usually don't look at my phone or read texts while I'm out &amp; about, but decided to see what was up because it was him.

He sent me a screenshot of his usernames &amp; passwords for his financial accounts, and soon after a suicide note. 

I stayed pretty calm, texted his girlfriend (I didn't have his parents' phone numbers) and let her know what was going on. She then was able to contact his mother, who found him somewhere local. He was admitted &amp; I had no contact with him for about a week or so.

He came into my office about a week &amp; a half after and simply said ""You saved my life, love you man.""

Something as little or simple as a text can save someone's life. Fucking nuts.

Edit: Thanks for the silver!! Didn’t think this would get as (relatively) big as it did! Just tried to help my bud as best as I could. 

P.S. - the money never left his accounts haha"
No. He started partying really hard. 
I was alone in the room when I felt the urge to readjust my balls.  I was wrist deep down there when my boss angrily came in. Stared at each other for half a second and he left. Never figured out what he was angry about.
Just decided one day to try to find small things during the day to be happy about because why not and now Im being told by friends Im one of the most genuinely happy people they know.
"I think it's a very common form of denial for people in unhappy marriages, to act like all marriages are unhappy, and even those that seem happy are just pretending (because the man is ""whipped,"" naturally). That way it's not their fault, it's ""just life.""

Not that everyone who makes those jokes is necessarily unhappy, but enough are that there is peer pressure to play along, and in some circles it is seen as ""unmanly"" to admit you actually like your wife."
"The same way anyone impresses me.

* Have some sort of plan for the future.
* Have some modicum of manners.
* Show that you respect yourself and others (and actually know what that means).

As others have said, I'll ask my daughter how well you treat her.

Bonus points:

* An education.
* Not being afraid to occasionally swear in front of me. I can dig it. (EDIT: might be an Australian thing)

"Going to the gym a lot this year helped me look in the mirror and see a good looking guy. Can't say women have said anything about it sadly. But I feel a little better.

Update. I appreciate all the great comments and apparently I got a Reddit silver. Who knew averaging 6 hours a week at the gym since June would not get me women but rather Reddit Silver :D"
"Didn't happen to me but there was a Contractor on the phone in our lobby with one of his guys talking about a job. When their conversation was finished he said ""Love you."" then immediately went, ""Oh, shit. Sorry man. Force of habit from talking to my wife.""

Not sure if that's what you were looking for but it was pretty funny."
"I lost my wallet in the presence of a good friend. Couldn’t figure out where it had gone. Searched her car and later on gave up. Went through the hassle of replacing my license, debit cards, credit cards, etc. A few months later I was at that same friends house. I went to grab a pen from her drawer and there was my wallet. I was so annoyed and hurt. She didn’t take any money but to me it was strange that she would keep it and not tell me she found it. What type of person does that. Her response was that she forgot to tell me she found it.

Edit: Sorry just realized this was Ask Men, I’m a woman. "
"Doing something is scarier than not doing something.

You can't help someone who doesn't want help.

If you can get away with doing nothing and still be comfortable then most people will do that. Your parents are supporting this. You do not evolve or adapt without pressures to do so.

Stop telling him has ugly scars on his face, He knows it."
I notice my boss’s clothes because she has sharp taste and is super hot. That’s about it at work.
"When my ex boyfriend was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He’s the nicest, most selfless person I know and before he got sick I thought he was it, that we’d die old together. He would have done anything I ever asked of him, even though I rarely did. His family was my family. I was closer to his mom than my own.


Over time he completely withdrew to where we’d only say a few words to each other a day. He kept getting worse and worse and I had to break it off when I realized he wasn’t going to get better and it wasn’t healthy for me to stay. Not fair that such a good person got so sick and it’s not fair we can’t be together because of it. 


EDIT: Thanks for the kind words strangers. We broke up almost a year ago and it still hurts sometimes. Really nice to read all these. 

EDIT 2: Also, I feel like I’m kind of venting and word vomiting here. I haven’t talked about it in a long time, so thanks also for letting me do that. It helps. "
"I graduated in May 2017, and just now got a job in my field. I applied to the company back in the summer, shortly after losing my first full time job. A family member offered me a reference, and I figured I had nothing to lose. I heard nothing. Fast forward, I had to get out of retail so I took a car sales job. I was making okay money, but promised I’d give this a fair shot first. 

One day I’m talking with a coworker and casually checked my email. The company I had applied to ages ago wanted to interview. After the interview and some negotiations, I’m finally working in my field with a salary roughly 25% above market value. I just finished my first week, and working on my first project solo. It’s daunting, but I honestly never thought I’d make it. 

Edit: This got more attention than I expected. To anyone out there job hunting, don’t give up. Keep pushing, it does get better. "
Walking through a hotel and saw a beautiful lady.  Turned my head to watch as she walked past.  Ran nuts first into the edge of a table.
"A few years ago, my new girlfriend rang me in tears as she was being verbally abused by her ex-husband and didn't have anyone else to talk to.  We'd only seen each other a few times at that stage, but she sounded so lost and upset I asked her where she was, left work and met her in the coffee shop where she was hiding out.

To me, it was just someone in need who didn't have anyone else to turn to, and it was totally natural for me to drop everything and lend a sympathetic ear.

We are married now, and she tells me that this was the moment when she realised she could trust someone, and that for the first time in her life someone would be there for her when it counted."
"We don't get hugs. If we ask for a hug usually we get creeped-out grimaces or polite ""I don't do hugs."" You learn to stop asking. Guys don't hug guys except in moments of extreme triumph or at funerals. And those are awkward and involve vigorous back-slapping. So if we hold on for a little long and it's kind of awkward, it's because nobody normally touches us and the endorphins are amazing.  


EDIT: Holy crap that's a lot of upvotes. This might be a serious problem that society needs to address."
"My cousin passed away when he was only 20, he was pretty much everything I wasn’t. He was like super model levels of attractive and in shape, was going through college and had a long term girlfriend and then one day he was just gone. While me the polar opposite of all that stuff just kind of got to persist. Never sat right with me 

EDIT: yeah I’m not answering all these, my self esteem is actually fine I’m doing alright for myself and what a person is “worth” I understand is wholly subjective but regardless of all that what I was really trying to say is I’d trade places with him if I could. Now I can’t and I understand and accept that but at the time it really showed my how unfair life is which was the original point of the post. "

"My daughters loved playing treasure hunt. Think like an Easter egg hunt. I would hide things around the house and  tell then to find something ""green, round, and bouncy"". They would have to figure out what the item was, such as a ball, and then find it. They would ask for clues to finding the items and I would say things like ""It's near water"" so they would look around the sinks and bath. 

The nice thing about it is that it takes up a good bit of time, it makes her think, it lets you take a little break while she runs around like mad trying to locate things. Also, if she gets tired of playing  before she finds everything, you have things already hidden for the next game."

"After I spent all of high school making straight A's, participating in school politics, making sure that I did everything I could to set myself up for college success. Then being smacked down by a bout of severe depression that caused me to drop a semester to take care of it. Went back and all my scholarships were gone. Decided to wait until my wife finished college so it would be easier on the both of us financially, and would make sure she could finish without taking loans.

"I'm 30 and just now starting to get over this girl that broke to with me back in May. Not a first love, but I was at a point where I could see myself marrying her. What helped me was I recently had a near death experience at work (a little overkill I know) that changed my whole perspective on life. Life's too short to be moping around over someone that doesn't reciprocate the same feelings as you. Get over it and move on, who knows what other enjoyable experiences you're missing out on because you're busy chasing the past. "

A woman on the train feel asleep next to me and ended up resting her head on my shoulder. As pathetic as it sounds it felt nice for the whole 10 seconds before she woke up and apologized. That's the only physical contact I've had in months.
"Friendly hugs happen somewhat often. Maybe once every 2-3 months on average.

And then a girl in one of my groups touched my arm and put her head on my shoulder because she was tired.

That's about it really for the last 2 or so years."
Probably when I was working with this girl and we went to grab the same thing and our hands laid on top of each other. It was so cliche but i made her flustered which was cute.
"Oh completely. I live in a large metropolitan area and worked in the bar industry. Friendships are very surface based and superficial to begin with. Especially in SoCal, which has an extremely sexual culture. Mix that with getting turned loose on the world at 18-22, and the one natural instinct that can sometimes shoehorn a temporary connection. It feels nice to lay in someone’s arms. It’s feels nice to be desired. I’ve even used sex to connect with girls I was dating. They may be sweet, healthy, successful and have a lot going for them. But I made the mistake of thinking that a lack in emotional connection could be made up for with sexual. "
"I really don't notice to be honest. There are some women in my office who frequently dress very fashionably and others who just dress business professional and I don't really notice. Every now and then I'll make a remark or pay a compliment: ""Those are nice earrings"" ""That's a neat shirt"" etc. But honestly the details - any given person would have to wear the same thing several days in a row for me to notice and ask myself ""has she worn that already""? I just don't pay attention to things like that. For context I'm 35, work in an office environment. "
"Depends whether she's hot or not. Like ""Yeah she's wearing the jeans in which her ass looks great!"""
"My job calls for literal months away from home and family per year. I am completely unashamed in my desire to be home with my three children and wife. I do this job for them, but that doesn't mean I enjoy being away. "
"I don't know how else to ask this... but do you envy his happiness? More importantly, do you think he'd be more happy with a better station in life, or do you think he'd just be ""better off""? There's no right answer. 

Clearly the family support is the root of the problem. It sounds like he'd probably be homeless or a in a pretty bad place if not for your parents. It's a problem, but apparently a blessing for him. If your goal is to light a fire under his ass, he needs to lose the support system and hit rock bottom. Otherwise, what's his motivation? 

Some of us have the career, drive, house, wife/gf, etc and are *miserable*. Life is strange. "
Yes. Absolutely. You beast.
"Not quite the same, but I once fell asleep while studying at the library, only to wake myself up due to my loud farts. I looked around and saw a group of girls staring at me with disgusted looks on their faces. I must have been farting for a while before I woke myself up"
"I was 12 and I was slowly and painfully dying of a kidney disease. Our school priest came up to me and told me this was all of God's plan.

Keep in mind, he had never been informed, warned, or educated on wet dreams. So he sees this weird black goo and starts absolutely panicking and CALLS FOR HIS MOM. So his mom and little sister run into the bathroom and are staring into his nut-filled boxer briefs. YIKES.

She’s never seen anything like it, so she runs him to the doctor. 

 Turns out, he had just bought new boxers and the black was just the lint kind of running into his semen and changed the color. 

My boyfriend learned about wet dreams from his doctor.

RIP"

I received a 90% on my calc 3 test this week. I needed an 80% to keep my B in the class. That was also my highest exam score in that class this past semester so I'm happy about that.
"We live next to the main street between Kantons (I live in switzerland), but our balcony is on the side that's away from the street, and covered by a big tree. So usually I'm fairly comfy getting a breath of fresh air in the morning, even in underpants.

One day I was setting up my usual coffee after just getting up, walked outside in boxers and a bad case of morning wood. And realized too late that about a dozen Teenagers on a camping trip, lead by young woman, were standing on the trail next to the main street.

So I stood there for a couple seconds, flagpole raised just above the fence, before I slowly slid back into the house.

I'm not sure if it's related, but we haven't seen any campers around here since."

Tell us what you want instead of dropping hints. Most guys don't have time for that and will assume you aren't interested.
I was on FaceTime with my crush for the first time and I accidentally let out a huge fart. There’s no way she didn’t hear it but I just acted like nothing happened.

"Skype for business is a genuine cluster fuck. I was once on a 6 hours presentation and mumbled, ""this is a waste of time"" (because it was) mistakenly thinking that I was still on mute. It really became a sticking point for one of the presenters to find out who had said that, but there were enough people on the call that there was no way they'd figure it out. I just muted myself and sat there like a statute for the next hour or so."
The excuse.. lol.
"Here's the thing. After a year you may think you're over them. Then after two you realize that you weren't, but you definitely are now. Then three comes along and proves that wrong.

Or maybe I'm totally wrong. I'll let you know how I feel when year 4 hits. "
Cuddling is pretty much the main reason why I do hookups.
"All the time, every day I am reminded of that. The best one recently was a guy I know who died a few weeks after being diagnosed with an aggressive cancer. 30 years old, married three months, fit as a butcher's dog, pillar of the community, great guy that everyone was devastated to lose so suddenly. Meanwhile the piece of shit alcoholic I know keeps not dying well into his 60's, having fucked up his marriage and his kids' lives over at least three decades while costing the tax payer a gold brick fortune to keep alive while being a PITA to everyone he comes into contact with. Funny old world, innit?"
"So, I went to college one semester when I was in my early 20s.  The campus gym had a ""Get In Shape For Spring Break"" 6 week class.  Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday we would meet up and do some kind of exercise and it always differed.  We generally met in this dance studio and then would go play basketball, ultimate Frisbee, etc. 

So, I should mention that I am a bigger guy.  Not morbidly obese but not thin and in good shape. I am outgoing and get along with everyone even if I dont know anyone.  I do get a lot more reserved and introverted if I feel uncomfortable or there is a chance where I can embarrass myself. 

I am in the dance studio one Wednesday and I notice I am one of the only guys there so far.  Well, the instructor (who I dont recognize but we had guest instructors from time to time) says, ""OK everyone grab a mat! Its YOGA TIME!"".  At this point, all the coeds take off whatever they were wearing and are all in Yoga clothes.  They were all good looking.  Some of them were jaw droppingly beautiful. So, at this point, I was thinking, ""Alright!  Chicks would love a guy who can do yoga!  They are all smoking hot and yoga is just stretching.  I can stretch! They will love a guy who does yoga!""  

Now, if you have done yoga before you know its not ""just stretching"".  Well, I quickly learned that after the first exercise and I was already sweating. Long story short, in that hour class, I moved my body into positions that I did not know I could.  I have never been more sweaty and out of breath.  My shirt was literally dripping so much sweat it looked like I had taken a shower with it.  I was so embarrassed and uncomfortable by the end, that I couldn't even look at any of the coeds in the class in the face.  I was so ready to get out of there.  After I put my mat up, the instructor, grabbed it and put it aside.  She then asked if I could grab some extra towels to mop up where I was sitting.  

After I mopped up, I was ready to get the fuck out of there.  I was never going back to the class.  As, I am leaving, I run into one of the regular class instructors who says, ""Joseph_Kickass!  We missed you the last 2 classes!"", I say, ""What do you mean?  I was there today for the yoga!"".  She says, ""Oh  the yoga class used our usual room, we were outside today!"" 

I took the normal yoga class that wasnt part of the ""Get In Shape"" class. 

TL;DR-  Accidentally took a yoga class and did terribly with 20 hot coeds who I couldnt look at by the end."
"My mom passed away when I was one. My brother was really close to her and my dad was close to me. My dad gave me more attention after her death because he felt I would need more support. My brother became jealous and hated me growing up.

My dad remarried this bitch of a woman who verbally and physically abused my brother and I. Growing up, i always thought how unfair it was she died and how much better all of our lives would be if mom didn't die."
"When it turned out the girl I was dating for over 2 months didn't see a serious relationship happening with me I actually was able to take it really well. No massive depressive thoughts, just some sadness but ultimately feeling grateful for the good times we had together. Turns out that putting effort into acting postive and taking control of your own life also has a nice effect on how you handle emotional matters :)"
I put a nice couch on Craigslist for free. Curb Alert. Someone picked it up and then emailed me to say her husband had just passed away and she was struggling financially to help her son furnish his dorm room as he was about to start college. The couch was nice and she was so relieved and happy she was beside herself.

Shit ain't right, bro."
"Heard this story from a co-worker recently...

An elderly man who was not aware of the exacts of video conferencing had to use the bathroom really bad during a conf call.

He disabled the video and took his laptop to the bathroom.

He turned his volume all the way down so that nobody would hear him.

And proceeded to fight with his intestines for 10 minutes.

Problem was...his volume has nothing to do with whether or not people can hear him....he left his mic on.  Everytime the grunting and splashing would occur, he would be highlighted.  Since his volume was all the way down he couldn't hear all the people screaming at him.

I have no idea why he took his laptop to the bathroom only to turn everything off (except the mic).  

Poor dude..."
Did anything happen after that? You know...like how they show in porn 
A few months back I went to three penis related calls in a week. It was pretty bizzare. My shift stated calling me the dick doc.

"My buddy was at baseball practice once, when he got the explosive diarrhea urge. Sprints to the bathroom is putting the seat down as he sits, his ball gets caught between the seat and the toilet as he sits on it. Crushes his nut. He had to go to the hospital. Now he has a prosthetic ball."
"No dramas.

Just after a rather bad break up I got on Tinder for some ""mind easing"" and ended up hitting it of with this lovely woman who lived in the same inner Sydney suburb as me (we will call her Jess) We had a lovely night at this wine bar near my apartment and both expressed that we were recently single and weren't looking for anything long term. After dinner we walked through the park along the water and chatted for about an hour before heading to her apartment. I can honestly say it was one of the best nights of sex ever. We were both very similar in our preferences and it just clicked well. When we woke up the next morning we left her apartment and went to a cafe down the road and I bought her breakfast. We sat in the morning sun and had a coffee before parting ways with a smile. Our apartment's were about a kilometre apart so I passed her often. Always with a hello and a pleasant smile exchanged but nothing more.
About 6 months later I was early stages dating someone (let's call her Stacey) and she invited me to a family dinner one Sunday out in the suburbs. I said yeah no dramas and went along. When I got there I met the family and had some lovley conversations with her parents. We all hit it off really well. About 2 minutes before we sat down for dinner her sister arrives and I'm introduced to my rebound partner... I played it off like I didn't know her and she the same but there was a palpable awkwardness the whole night. About a week later Jess called me and we spoke about it. Not long after I broke up with Stacey. Neither Jess or I told her but she knew something was there. 
Wayyyyy too much awkward at that dinner table!"

"Hey man, good on you for remembering the friend who wanted to go in the first place. Some people might not have even put two and two together. "
"A friend of mine (more like a brother to me) had his parents do everything by the book, worked really hard, were very decent and kind people. Unfortunately though, their mother died when he and his siblings were kids, their father struggled between his work and being a single parent therefore the kids fell back at their studies and didn't do well at school. Later on in life, the father got imprisoned for something he didn't do, and soon after his release, he got sick and died shortly after that. 

My friend and his siblings are in a much better place right now, but they definitely did not deserve all the shit they've been through "
"Pretty sure I've been in love with one of my old high school friends for about 10 years. Idk my brain just won't let it go. It's not so bad anymore, just distracting at times. We were awful together, but I still love her."
"(For context, I grew up in the late 90s. So these are more non-tech based ideas).

I had a stay at home Dad (he worked from home) for a few years while I was growing up and he would;

With Dad:

Take me to the park and we'd play ball games (he taught me how to throw/catch for baseball/softball, kick a soccer ball properly, etc.) or we'd play on the play equipment.

Play board and card games like connect 4, guess who, snap, go fish, and eventually moved to harder card games (he taught me solitaire which would keep me occupied for a while).

Go to the library and pick out books. Sometimes he'd read with/to me, other times I did solo/quiet reading.

He'd involve me in grocery shopping by getting me to name everything we bought (I was very impressive at big school when I could name ALL the fruit and veggies, including the not so common ones).

He'd get me to help make lunch (I got very good at making sandwiches and pasta. Especially spaghetti sandwiches).

He taught me random chores like ironing (start out by teaching to iron small items like hankies, or something), separating laundry, etc.

Alone activities:

Quiet reading by myself (I loved quiet reading, and still do).

Art Attack/Bob Ross painting videos or general crafting by myself. In fact, we had a ""1001 fun crafts for kids"" book, so he'd just set up craft activities for me (use pinterest nowadays though) and I'd go to town just making random crafts. Usually it was never the intended craft, but I had fun just doing whatever.

Colouring in books.

I'd watch sesame street, play school, blues clues, bananas in pyjamas, etc. or a movie. I know there are more educational tv shows now though, so whatever her favourites are, are a good choice. tbh though, my dad usually let me watch whatever G-rated show/movie I wanted to.

I'd play dress up (sometimes he'd join me)

I'd play with my dolls/my little pony/etc. (again, sometimes he'd join me)

&amp;#x200B;

Group/out of home activities:

Through out my childhood I was signed up to dance classes, girl guides, local play groups, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I loved having my dad as my main caregiver for about 2ish years, and I'm currently in my 20s and my Dad and I are very close and have a great relationship.

Hats off to you! You're doing great! 😊

&amp;#x200B;

eta: Hey stranger friends, thanks for the very positive response. I'm glad this list is helpful. Just remember you can turn boring things like doing groceries or trips to the hardware store into fun by making everything a game. Also, don't feel bad leaving your kid to be independent and do things ""alone"", as that created a lifelong love of reading and crafting for me and my sister."
Take a huge fart by accident while picking up my 12 year old brother at middleschool and i was waiting in a room full of 6th grade guys

She was outside smoking and i had walked back inside, tried to fart... sharted. ran upstairs as fast as possible, threw my boxers in the trash, washed the lower half of my body and jumped back out and put on new pants. Was greeted with ""Why'd you change?"" .. ""because uhhhh I just wanted to be more comfortable.""

"Didn't pull into my usual lane one time omw home. By the time I realized, anoyher car pulled up into the first spot. I pulled up behind him. He took a turn when the light turned green, which slowed me down a bit and I was a bit flustered by why didn't I get in that lane. As I was going forward into the intersection, a massive pickup plows through at like 50 mph, missing all traffic and swerving into the blouvard. I was inches and a few second from getting TBoned. 

Had I been in my usual lane omw home and that car didn't slow me down, I am not sure what may have happened to me but it wouldn't have been good."

First job after college. I was kind of assured a position at the place where I interned at but the project was cancelled so they couldn't hire me.

It took a while to get hired somewhere else because my resume didn't look that great for a biologist and I was kind of starting to lose hope. 

Turned out great though when I did get hired. I get along with my boss and the team, I like the work and it offers good future perspectives through training. The job makes me want to get better at it.

Having structured workdays and weeks is also good for me."

Had an old friend of mine take his life 7 years back. Since then I try to be more friendly with my mates. I’d rather risk being considered “a fag” by some insecure wanker than have to bury another friend.

"Decided to try for a third kid. But the deal was that we'd have unprotected sex one time, if it takes cool, if not, we're happy with the two kids we've got. Well it took. Couple months later we went for a sonogram and found out my wife was pregnant with fucking triplets. Spent the next few months in daze while trying to process what was happening. Luckily everyone was born healthy and complete, without complication. I now have 5 kids under the age of 8 and my house seems like a fuckin circus with three baby chimps on the loose. On the upside, it's filled with enough love to make all the craziness worth it."
"100% agree with that. My wife is on a clinical rotation 2ish hours away and has been gone for 4 months (while visiting most weekends). I can see where its ""fun"" for a week in that I dont have to worry about cleaning up dishes in the sink every night instead of waiting a day or something like that but it gets lonely extremely quickly after that. Cant wait for Friday!"

They are all dicks when they are calling me at my job yelling at me for help... But they really aren't. They are just living their lives. I've grown far more patient after that. "

My best friend killed himself and my girlfriend who I loved deeply broke up with me in the same week so I went on a year long tinder bender.  It got pretty bad.  I was just trying to feel something and started equating sex with closeness.  If a girl wasn’t in my bed I would feel alone but pretty soon I would just still feel alone with a stranger next to me.

"There's a quote I read once (paraphrasing) that the reason there are so many more male comedians than female comedians is the same reason there are so many more male guitar players than female guitar players: because both are a means for men to get laid.

"I stopped whining and feeling sad when I would tell girls I liked them and they wouldn't feel the same way. 

Since most of them started being my friends, I ask if they're cool continuing as friends. Most of them say yes and it's actually pretty cool to keep nice girls around. Quite frequently they're friends with other cool girls and it helps me meet new people who might be interested in me. Thanks to this, now when I go out, it's usually with 3-4 pretty attractive girls and 1-2 cool dudes, so that's nice. I've heard other girls won't mind you approaching them if they see you with other girls, but I have yet to try this."

"&gt; because both are a means for men to get laid

This is part of it, but the underlying issue is a little deeper. Men have to learn to be funny because that's one way to initiate socialization in general, which is a responsibility that falls on men. In my experience most women can just stand there at a social gathering and someone will come chat with them, either another group of women or a guy looking to flirt.

If a man stands by himself at a party, that is how his entire evening will be spent unless he actively makes a push to join others and break into their social circle. Being funny is a quick inroad to that.

EDIT: Thanks for the good vibes y’all! She and I are both in professional school, her in TX and I in New England. She knows how I feel and she’s given me a very sweet and forthright answer: That although she cares about me a lot and I make her happy, she’s not in a place to be looking for a relationship right now. So it’s more of me sucking it up like a big boy and moving on! But we’re friends above everything else!"

We ended up talking for like 3 hours and a couple times I thought to myself, ""I hope she gets the fuck outta the car, I'm so tired"" but the convo was flowing and she was hot as hell so I didn't ask her to leave... finally she was like ""holy shit are we going to have sex or not, I've been waiting for like 3 hours"" and I was like ""Wha? Wait, gah? Duer, oh... Wait wha?"" 

I was SO confused because I thought she was WAY outta my league... She was NBA caliber, and I was youth recreational basketball (where they don't keep score because everyone sucks and they don't wanna hurt feelings).

Anyway we dated for 3 and 1/2 years and it ended a few years ago, but we're still super close to this day."

It’s sad when I think back on it. But I hope he’s doing well today. "
"Quit smoking.  Ended up saving enough money each month to get a used car and make a monthly payment.  That helped my credit improve and eventually was able to turn that car in and get a brand new car.  Due to my credit score increasing I now had my first credit card as an adult.   That led to one more.  Because I quit smoking I had more energy and started going to the gym.  I lost over 100lbs!  I wasn’t on so many smoke breaks now so i was better at my job and ended up getting a raise and a promotion!  Finally i just bought a house a few weeks ago.  

There were a bunch of other factors and a lot of hard work, however I really credit the first step of quitting smoking to the beginning of my success."

At a party, chatting it up with this girl who is the sober driver.  She said she had 1 seat left and was going my way.  I lived the closest out of anyone in the vehicle, in fact, my place was right off the road to everyone else's.  

She left to drive an overly drunk friend home, said she would be back.  An hour or so had passed, and I was getting pretty tired, so I said fuck it and started walking.  About 1km into my walk, this car pulls up and a dude jumps out yelling at me (I had headphones on).  ""Oh fuck, this is how I die""

Headphones come off, buddy says they've been looking for me.  Girl was driving.  Awesome.

They offer me the front passenger seat.  I take it.  We're driving on and pass my street, I mentioned it.  She says she's dropping everyone else off.

Everyone else is done and we're in her neighbourhood, she tells me.  I said something like ""oh cool, I used to live around here"".  She takes me back the way we came from and to my place.  We sit in the car, parked in front of my house for a few minutes.  I say ""well, best for me to head in"". Say good night, have an awkward in car hug, and I head in.

She stayed out front for about 5 minutes after I left.  I know because I looked out the window and waved.

And don’t forget that letting her help you do chores and food preparation is good too. I’ve never met a kid who doesn’t like using a broom, or pulling the leaves of a head of lettuce or something.

I didn’t really know him yet so I was like um... I’m not sure how to help... report it and try to think about who did it? I’m not good with crying folks, I never know what to do. 

So anyway, I ask if coming over to his house will help. He says yes. I stay the night. Long story short, I never left (slowly moved my things in over time) and now we’re happily married for two years!"

B) Tell your dad to fire him. Your parents have to kick him out (with notice). No buying food, no financial support. I can all but guarantee you'll see some major changes.

However, mine didn't end so well. I told her I loved her because, honestly, we had been up all damn night in her car talking and having sex off and on all night. In the morning she dropped me back off at my dorm which is when I said what I said. It was so fucking awkward but I was way sleep deprived. She laughed it off. We were just fuck buddies after that but I did develop actual feelings for her but she didn't feel the same. Way awkward. She actually messaged me years later on facebook apologizing for how she treated me (she knew I liked her but treated me like crap really) Looking back I now realize she was just trying to get with me again. I had moved on.

Yesss!  Your answer is better layed out than my question I suppose.  Using sex and physical touch etc for connection because you can't seem to find it emotionally in some way.  Maybe even with close friends you're still not feeling the human connection you desire.
"Oh man when I was in high school my dad asked me why there was so much hair in the shower drain,  and I thought quick to tell him I tried shaving my armpits to see if it would help with the smell. He said okay and went on.

He asks me to flex, and he just has this smug smile when I do and tells me I’m putting on some muscle. I didn’t realize till later that he was just trying to get a look at my armpits to see if I was lying and actually manscaping. "

The doctor said that the fetus didn't make it, and it didn't have a heartbeat that he could find. My girlfriend and I cried every night for a week as we slept, and thought there was a still fetus between us. Since it was a doctor that told us this. We didn't think to have a second opinion. One week later though we had a checkup. That's when we heard the sound of our baby son beating strong. Tears of loss, and hopelessness turned to joy, and happiness. It's been 8 years since that happen, and I can still feel the bubbling joy in my stomach as I heard his heart beating through the sonogram. "

You learn to deal with the feelings, and you overcome them slowly.”

Physical contact? What's that?
"It's a trope in and of itself.  
Firstly, people don't go around venting how they love their wife, but they will vent negative things, so you might just not hear the positives.  
Secondly, societal customs makes it discouraged to be overly affectionate for men, especially in front of other men.  
Thirdly, maybe they don't. Marriages aren't renewed or care about the actual state of the relationship, they are just there, canceling them is comitment, but that doesn't mean that every marriage that still exists is a marriage that is still felt or something that both parties would agree to again."

Just because I want to have sex with you doesn't mean I don't respect you as a person. If anything it's the other way around. The only reason *I* would find you sexy enough to sleep with is if I liked you as a person.

When he eventually died, I was completely destroyed, and there was a big part of me that thought ""this is fucking bullshit. He doesn't deserve this""

It was a real wakeup call for me. It doesn't matter how much you're loved, how good you are, how hard you work. The universe is completely and utterly indifferent to all of that.

She did so, we talked a long while about what lead up to this. She said she doesn't regret it but knows it was a mistake (wtf?). I'm still trying to decide what i actually want at this point, wether to try and work things out or get a divorce.

It's hard to just up and leave someone who has been part of my life so tightly for so long."
"I protect my space.   I don’t want people who cheat on their  partners,  or find it acceptable in others in my life,  who are ok with those who have assaulted people,    who aggressively insult people who have asserted claims they don’t believe against their friends/ people they are fans of  ( unless they are/ know the alibi to be truthful) . 

I don’t like people who speak poorly of others on the basis of ’I don’t like them’  rather than poorly of an action that they want advice on.  

I don't like mlm sellers who put emotional pressure  their friends /family to buy goods from them.   
 
I also know I am difficult ( I have ptsd and react poorly )  so I take MYSELF out if circulation when I feel reactive or if I feel reactive to a certain person.   My feelings are not others’ problems do I don't impose them.

"I'm over 50 and at some point when I was 35 or so I realized I still wasn't over my first love, a girl from high school, first girlfriend blah blah blah. Then my father died and she looked me over. She liked my dad and wanted to know how I was holding up. By then she was married, and I had just left a long term relationship.

We talked a lot, it was good to see her, but I realized several things that made my brain click... One, this 30-something woman in front of me was not the 20 year old that had left me all those years ago. Two, she was definitely not the 16 year old I had fallen in love with. Three, the huge amount of pain and longing I had felt on and off for over 10 years had been caused by... a freaking 16 year old teenage girl who had no clue what she was doing, anymore than I had a clue what I was doing.

It was a bit ridiculous, really, that a grown-ass man, successful, self-sufficient, should be pining for the whims of a freaking teenage girl that didn't even exist anymore. So it kinda just... stopped. I wish I could've triggered that sooner, it would have saved me a lot of grief and scarring."

one of my best friends, who is a lesbian, was dating a guy out of denial (for 5 years)

she realized what she was doing, then broke up with him at 2 am, chaos ensued and she tried to kill herself

I brought home a kitten I had rescued that had ring worm (I had no clue of course) and caused a small scale epidemic in my town due to there being lot of people in my house and friends that come in and out of my house. This eventually caused it to spread through my high school and within the families of the kids that got it. This one kitten caused about 6 families and a total of about 40 people to get ringworm.

I hesitate as I'm all natural at the time thinking I could just roll up the leg. She looks at me asks ""is there a problem?"". I go on to tell her I'm not wearing underwear and is there a male Dr. She went on to say shes a medical professional and they were short staffed. My thought ""Ok cool"" so I dropped them. She was professional as I was I trying to hide the obvious awkwardness of me being exposed. As shes starting to push and feel my knee I start to get this raging boner while she is sitting there doing her work. My penis is maybe a foot away from her face at full attention. I notice and take my hands trying to tuck it into my undershirt, holding it in place, and then she notices. She finishes up her stuff on my knee and I'm fucking red as shit by this point. I get to get dressed back up and she leaves I'm so fucking embarrassed at this point.

"So I just finished watching F Is For Family S3 (just came out) and its amazing how on point that show is with its MC Frank Murphy about this very phenomenon you're talking about.

Its a simple matter of you're living with someone constantly, and if you don't have absolutely everything figured out, you're stressed, your work life isn't fulfilling, and your kids are fucking up left right and centre. You never have any real ill will towards anyone but you snap and yell at people on occasion, and occasionally need to take an hour or two away for some peace.

But you do properly love them, and say for example if your neighbour calls you and suggests that your wife is really tense because she's horny and that you need to put her on her tummy and ""show her who's boss"", the response is to literally get a crowbar and prepare to bash his skull in for being so blatantly disrespectful to your wife

Put simply, just because someones home live isn't easy doesn't mean they don't love their family"

"I can only speak from my own personal experience, I'm in my mid 20s also. Why would your brother ever want to move out? Sounds like he has a pretty fantastic life getting babied by his mother, not expected to really do anything around the house. He has a live in maid, food and house for only £50 a week. Why on earth would anyone ever leave that? You need to give him incentives to want to move out. Make him pay more and have to do chores. Any rent he pays you should take but put into a saving fund that he can only access on the contingency that he moves out and gets a job. That money will then be leaked to him to assist with rent. 

At the barest minimum he should be expected to do household chores. What life skills does he have? Also you should deal with his weed problem. I'm just going to assume that's a thing. I've nothing against weed but it is definitely known to make people ok with doing nothing. 

He's shown himself to not have self motivation and he's shown he can't actually do the things he claims he does.

"At a Halloween party a couple years ago my friend started acting weird and making other people uncomfortable. He lived right next to my place so I told him to go home and sleep it off. He didn't make a big deal out of it so I thought we were all cool. We'd never had any problems before this and I figured he'd cool down and we'd forget about it.
A couple weeks later he shot up my house, hitting me in the face and hand. This lead to some psychological issues on my part that my wife of less than a year couldn't deal with. She left me for some stranger she met at a bar. I moved out, she moved the new into the house within the week and kept the dog we got right after we were married.

But it gets worse!

About two months after the divorce her new apartment caught fire, killing the dog.

So, kicking a guy out of a party at my house cost me use of my hand for a couple months, my marriage, my house, and my dog.

Looking back, I still feel did the right thing and I would do it again."
"My husband is a plumber. 

He overheard a clerk at our grocery store complaining about her cold shower and since he was just coming from work had all his tools, offered to take a look for her.

The clerk and her mother were crying shrieking. He hadn’t seen anything like it. He said something like “You’re really passionate about your showers, huh?” 

They explained **they hadn’t had hot water in three years** and couldn’t afford anyone to come check out the plumbing. "

"My female equivalent of a ‘guy moment’ is similar to this.

I was seeing this guy pretty casually earlier this year, but it was obvious we were into each other.  We went out for drinks and it was getting pretty late, and I was a bit tipsy.

We were talking about a variety of things but the topic somehow got onto my roommates. I was telling him how they’re all kinda crazy and they go crazy whenever I want to bring anyone over even if its just for an afternoon/evening.

And then he replies “what would happen if you brought a guy over for a night?” With a smirk.

BUT my tipsy brain didn’t register it as anything other than a regular question so I went on to say “you know what I dont even know what they would do, they freak out with just a regular friend being there, idk about a guy!”

when I realized next morning I face palmed myself so hard."

We're not always ready to share how we feel about something at the moment. Trying to force us to talk could make some guys just mad about the whole thing.

We're aren't as self-confident as we act.

I think most guys like using tongue when they kiss.

If you shower with your boyfriend, he'll probably like the water a lot colder than you do.

When having sex, he probably prefers it faster than you do.

Sure most the time we get hit by you it doesn't hurt, but other times it hurts like a bitch and it's taking every once of will not to snap.

Everyone likes compliments, guys are no exception, in fact I dare might say we like it more than girls."

"Also female lurking here, feel safer responding to your post.  Ex's nephew was 12 when he spilled a pot of boiling water directly into his lap somehow. Suffered really bad 3rd degree burns on his junk, which should be bad enough, but his mom is one of those over-sharers on social media.  

Not only did she describe in detail (how it happened, what it looked like,  was there pus, can he feel anything, etc) but she posted PICTURES of it on facebook.  They were zoomed in enough to not tell what body part it was but she clearly indicated we were looking at 12 year old penis burns.  Someone reported and it was taken down but she still posted daily updates. He ended up in the hospital for a while, needed a skin graft. 

Don't have contact with ex or his family anymore so not sure what current status is but he is now 13, and I'm sure he has his own facebook. I'm assuming that has to be embarrassing as hell, poor thing. Hope his ween works and his mom calms TF down :/"
Lol who the fuck gets “noticeably horny” from just seeing a stiffy? Y’all been watching too much porn. 
"I think this issue is much more unique to women than men. 

Just to set my perspective, I’m a guy in his late 20s, good job, city living, and have been fairly successful with women throughout my life. 

But it takes a lot of work to try and have sex. I have to either go out to the bar and hit on multiple women - make them laugh, buy drinks etc. to get a chance of a number (usually they won’t go home on first night, and many turn me down (married, etc)), or I have to swipe through dating apps and get ghosted 30 times, with a handful of people who might want to meet. The ones who do I’m usually less attracted to. 

So unlike my friends who are women who can all get sex easily, for men it’s not that way for me, and even much more difficult for guys who are less confident. 

So our connection grows with hobbies, our friends, work, etc., much more easily than trying to find connection through sex. 

When I do have sex with someone, it’s usually a heat of passion for me more than missing human touch. Like I’m more likely to have great intense sex, but then not want to cuddle afterwards. When I do really miss human connection, I’ll work harder on meeting women and I’ll try and develop a relationship rather than just sex "

"I grew up in the woods and running around, peeing on slugs was my friends' and my hobby of choice. We'd always see how far away we could stand from our victims while executing our urination assassinations. I *always* won and, consequently, had a reputation within my friend group for having ""strong weiner muscles."" So, one day, I'm fully loaded and out slug hunting but couldn't find any slugs. I'm about to burst. So, I give up the hunt and whip my little guy out to relieve myself. Now, like I said, I was the undisputed distance champion in the group but we had never even thought of measuring how *high* we could pee. So, instead of aiming out, I aim up, and let it flow. Now, I didn't want to introduce a new event in our Micturation Olympiad if I didn't think I could win it. Obviously, I needed to know just how high my stream reached so I looked down...and then screamed, and danced around in agony in the middle of the woods with my 2nd grade weiner just flopping around and pissing everywhere like a little rogue firehose.

"You feel like you are doing something special and unique, when in reality you are just following another herd.

You will at times feel very isolated, and very anxious, and at other times you will feel like you are the King of your surroundings.

As some Op have said, there is a feeling that everyones lives have progressed ""normally"" at home, and when you try to talk to them about your travel experiences, , everything just feels ever so slightly odd. They don't want to hear your ""holiday"" stories.

if you want to know what it feels like coming back from travelling the world on a shoestring, if anyone even does that anymore. Watch the scene in the Lord of the Rings when they are all back in the pub at the end :

*“How do you pick up the threads of an old life ? How do you go on, when in your heart you begin to understand...* ***there is no going back*** ? *There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken hold...…..”*

You will lose friends, without a doubt. You will look at everything very differently, for the rest of your life.

She more than likely spent the last couple months of our relationship going through the breakup process. I'm not saying it was easy for her but the entire time she was going through the process she had me to come to lay down with at the end of the day and she had the comfort of knowing she could decide to stay. She got all the closure, she knew why she wasn't happy, she had the luxury to know what went wrong. All I got was a short explanation and an ""I'm sorry I just need to be alone"". 

I saw her on snap that weekend out with her friends while I was sitting alone in my apartment trying to pick up the pieces. I'm not saying it was easy for her, but it was definitely a helluva lot easier than for me."

I bought 3 cakes (enough for the whole class) utensils, soda, and some napkins. An hour later I show up to class and ask him if we can throw a small party for him. This man was speechless. He hugs me and we throw a party. This is when things get really interesting.

After the party, some of us (students) walk to his office to drop off what was leftover (some napkins and utensils) for the next time we have a party. We say goodbye to him and go our way. The thing is my car was parked on the left side of the building but for whatever reason I felt like walking on the right side with another girl from the class who lived nearby. She ends up telling me how nice I was for doing this and we ended up having great conversation to the point that she asks me if I want to go up to her apartment to keep talking.

We get up to her apartment we continue talking about traveling, school, the future, etc. Eventually, it’s very obvious she an I have great chemistry and we exchange numbers. I end up asking her on a date about a week later, she says yes and we have a great time at this Italian place about 10 minutes from her place. 

Unfortunately, she couldn’t really get past the age difference (she’s 32 and I’m 21) so we remain close friends. As time goes on I open up to her that I’m having some issues in my household and I just need to figure out how to become independent and do things my own way. She ends up suggesting that if I need a job she could put in a good word at the night club she works in. I eagerly accept the offer and in a week I get an interview. I show up, have a great conversation with the two interviewers and get the job. And that was basically the time buying cake for my calculus professor got me a really good friend and my first job at one of the best night clubs outside of Las Vegas. "
Oh. Thanks bruh
I mean I had a girl I was into constantly talking about how she had never been and wanted to go so badly. I asked her to homecoming and she turned me down... so you never know.

"This sounds like a win in my book. You not only did something you'd never do otherwise and finished through with it, you kicked ass at it (because you still have to try in order to sweat!) There's nothing better than seeing someone genuinely giving it their all, *especially* in something they're not good at.

I sweat a lot too and am nowhere near overweight. I've had to have floors moped up after me, and my shirt is always dripping after workouts. I find it very unattractive to see a girl in a class/the gym who's half-assing it or who doesn't care. If you're going to do something, do it to your max otherwise why are you wasting your time?

Trust me dude, this is a great story. You should do another yoga class!"

"As a slacker at heart, I sort of understand your brother.    

All you can do is stop supporting him. Raise his rent, stop doing his chores, male.upur dad treat him like a regular employee and see what happens.    

He probably still won't match what you consider to be a fulfilling life, but if he can survive  in a  somewhat self-sufficient manner why change that?     

People don't, and shouldn't, all want the same things from life. If he can be content and has basic social survival skills then you should be content with him."

"As a guy, 

I get the full minute by minute rundown of neighbours or your friends story, even if I don't ask.

"Had a crazy ex (f) who was physically and emotionally abusive. She got mad at me for something stupid, that I forgot by now, and started whaling on my face closed fisted while I was driving. I got stopped by the cops for swerving because it's hard to stay between the white lines while you're getting right crosses to the face.  While I (m) was explaining what had happened to the cop who stopped me they interrupted my story and asked her if I had even touched her so they could put me in jail. Despite my face being red and swollen. We both answered no but they kept insisting that she tell the ""truth"" despite my face. I'm lucky she wasn't mad enough at me to lie to the police. That day I got interrogated and made to feel like a degenerate wife beater after getting my ass kicked."
I would ask myself why would my kid say that in the first place 🤔

"What is love? Obligatory “baby don’t hurt me”, but really, what does that mean? Have deep feelings for her? Do nice things for her? All the horrible boyfriends/husbands I’ve seen have love for their partner, but they’re also shit bags."
To be clear I was very drunk. Said my own name.
"No one knew about this girl I loved because everyone thought I was worthless but her.  She saw value in me when no one else did.  We had gone to lunch one day and we admitted we had feelings for each other.  She was killed that night by a drunk driver running from the cops.  No one knew we were even talking to each other, cuz no one saw value in me.  Even my folks insisted I don't date because they didn't want to have to raise 'any more broken kids'.  I haven't dated since, and that was thirteen years ago."

"Culture is a part of it. 

I have no problem asking a friend if they need a hug in the US. Sometimes even shout ""random hug alert"" and hug them.

In Thailand, if I do that to men, I'm gay. If I do that to women, it's sexual harassment. "
"I was once in a Chatroom and there was this girl which wanted to Skype/talk to me because she was bored. In 99,9% of the time I would have said no because I hate it to talk to people I do not know via Internet. But well I gave it a try and we talked like 10 hours without a break. 

Never felt so close to a Human before. Was an fantastic day. Probably the best I have had so far. One day later she called me again via Skype if I wanted to go on Vacataion with her this Summer ( litterally less then 2 months). I said sure why not. And thought as if this would ever happend. I knew myself and was sure she would get disappointent if she would see me. 

We drove together to The Netherlands had 2 fantastic weeks. Are together since almost 2 Years. Living together since 6 Months and are engaged since a few weeks.

I screw for once my shyness and did something I would have never do in general. 

BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE SO FAR :))))"
I let drunk me handle that. He is a natural. Still would like to know what he says.
"Ha, ""Fit as a butcher's dog""   love that!"

"Someone in my sports performance class in HS straight up told me he's racist towards black people. I asked if he had an experience with someone that made him think like that and he said, ""no, I just don't like them.""

"True, but I bet he didn't warn you people will forever feel entitled to stick their hands in your face."

"When I was a freshman in College I had a roommate who I wasn't really comfortable talking to about jerking off. When he'd leave I'd text him and ask him when he'd be home so I knew if I had time to do my thing without fear of him being home. He'd usually tell me and always ask why I wanted to know. Instead of telling him the real reason, I told him I wanted to poop with the door open. Now my other friends and I all refer to jerking off as ""Pooping with the door open"" or PWTDO. "
"“Yep, that’s me, you might be wondering what I’m doing here.”"
"&gt; But then she told me it was all a lie and that I never could please her which is why she left me for a guy she was cheating with.

F

But that was probably just her using the nuclear option to hurt you as grievously as possible stop you quibbling or begging and making her feel bad about her infidelity, because she's a a cunt. Not that it's going to help the massive complex you will likely develop and need many rounds of therapy to get over, but still. I feel for you bro."
That wasnt the goal
It was actually their kid who goes back in time and steals the money to ensure that he is born
"Not every feeling has to be acted on. If you know how you feel and have come to terms with it, you can have normal relationships. "
Talk to her
The thing that helped me the most was realizing that I was never truly in love with her. I was in love with the girl I wanted her to be. 
"Bro, you made me cry at the gym. "

"I’m a teacher. I decided I would find one thing to like about every single student. When the kids are working and I’m quiet that’s what I’m thinking about — what’s amazing about Joe? What do I love about Krystal?

It’s been two years and I am so much happier than I used to be. I look forward to going to school and seeing the kids, and the bad behavior doesn’t stress me out as much. Tiny thought change, big change in happiness. "
"You gotta remember cheating isn't a mistake. When someone cheats they continue to make the choice to do so. Downloading a dating app and finding someone, meeting someone at the bar etc. aren't split second decisions. You bet your ass she thought about it long enough to realize she didn't care. She made her choice to destroy what you had. Don't let someone like that hurt you again bud. You are worth so much more than that. "
"Size and effectiveness.  I know this is probably pretty common as well as the common response of ""size doesn't matter"" ""women don't really care"".  To be honest, I believed wholeheartedly these statements until recently. 

I'm on the small side, but I try really hard and am really concerned with my partners pleasure.  I do all the things as well as I can.

What's really fucked with me lately is that my ex assured me over and over that I was fine in the size department, sex was good, and she loved how much I wanted to please her.  But then she told me it was all a lie and that I never could please her which is why she left me for a guy she was cheating with. 

I don't know if that's what you wanted, but there it is. "
You are a safe comfortable person to him and he is really holding some feelings for you

"If a woman is going to belittle you like that, then it’s a sure sign that you should drop her and find another woman. A person like that isn’t someone worth being with. And no, don’t sleep around if you aren’t into it. "
"Seth, is this you? If so. I thought you hated Reddit. If not. A buddy did this exact see thing to me and you're a good person. "
She's into you
"A few people have mentioned that it's not okay to respond to words with violence, and I totally agree. That said, there's such a thing as a stupid expectation, and if you're expecting someone to take the high road when you've taken the low road, that's a stupid expectation.

So if my son was spouting racial slurs and got his ass whooped for it, I'd probably say ""what the fuck did you think would happen, you dumbass?""

After things calmed down a bit, and he wasn't feeling so sore from the whole event, I'd actually try and get to the bottom of where that kind of language is coming from."
Bonus rule
All he wanted was to be loved. He didn't need to call back after that.
"This was almost 10 years ago!!! Driving down a 2 lane highway one morning with my Best GirlFriend after a night of bar hopping. I see this guy drivin his truck eyeballing her in my passenger seat. Now Im a fun girl myself so I decided to tell my buddy she was getting checked out! He kept looking and smiling and looked cute and not creepy. So I did what any bestfriend would do. I told him to get out his phone so he could type her number in. His phone had died he motioned to me as we drove side by side down the highway. So then...I kid you not he grabs a piece of paper and a pen and I start holding my hands up to piece her phone number out so he could write it down. Called her, He ended up living in the neighborhood across the street from my parents house. They started casually seeing each other and now they have 2 Kiddos! She moved into his house he had and theyve been happy ever since!!! One of the best couples I know. And I pretty much did all that shit!

How did the beans get above the frank!?!? 
I was attending an alumni dinner with my girl friend for a private school her parents put her in when she was younger. An ex-teacher of the school was giving a speach and announced he was creating a scholarship for less privledged youth and was personally donating $10000 to get it started. The room was completely silent. I stood up and started cheering and clapping. I was up there by myself for a good ten seconds. Then suddenly the entire hall errupted in cheering and clapping. Im certain that if I hadn't given this guy the applause he deserved no one would have. 
I gotta say this is the most infuriating thread I've read in a while. I want to give every one of you bastards a hug. 
"Ah yes, the basics."
"To me it was when we were having a fight, the discussion become very heated, and I left the flat in anger to cool down, she called me and I realised she'd been crying, and it hit me like a train that I did not want her to be sad, ever, and especially never because of me. So yeah, for me love is this constant need that I have to know that she's happy, that she's not suffering, and that if she happens to be unhappy or sad, I will do anything in my power to make it stop. "
Other women are the best social proof. If your friends seem alright and trust you then when figure you're a decent guy. And if they're hot then that's evidence that you're high status yourself because we're a bunch of signal-obsessed apes.

"My experience is that men are generally better at the quick gutbuster and more slapstick type stuff, while women are better at maintaining an entertaining conversation over longitudinal time. I'd rather have a drink with the guys and a talk with the women if that makes sense. Total entertainment kind of evens out over time. 

Obviously that's just my experience and a generality even within that. "
Mine too. Hashimotos has a ridiculous number of symptoms. And it can become lupus at any time 
I had a similar situation. Newly pregnant but doctor told us the baby’s HCG (growth hormone) levels weren’t increasing and we were going to miscarry.  Doctor recommended I come in for a D and C to clean me out so I could start trying again. My husband and I decided that if I was going to miscarry I would just let it happen naturally. After two weeks of no miscarriage we went back in and the doctor told us everything was fine after all. We got a new doctor.  That “D and C” is now 23 years old and is 6’5” so he grew just fine. 
This sounds more of a win to me

His mother also just heard him shaving with an electric razor for 10 minutes.  Imagine her surprise when he emerged with a full beard still."

"Looking back over the last week or two, I can remember two things a female coworker has worn:   

On Friday my boss wore a bright green tshirt. Or it might have been a dress. It was green though. Or yellow. It was like almost neon though, definitely.   

A few days ago, the ""I have such a huge crush but she has a boyfriend and isn't interested in me"" girl wore a black and white shirt I've seen her in at least once before. I remember because it's kinda half open at the back and I could see her shoulderblades.   

However, regarding hair, I can probably tell you how each female coworker wore her hair, 100% yesterday, about 75% for any day in the last week, and about 60% for two weeks ago. "
"I fell asleep in math class, and the teacher woke me up and made me stand at the back of the class. Problem is, I woke up with a raging boner, so I had to use my binder to try and hide it. Everyone saw it, girls were giggling and I was super embarrassed. "

"I work in a restaurant and the office is next door to the unisex toilets ,there is two of them and one was broken. 

It was quiet so I thought I could drop the kids off at the pool without anyone interrupting....midway through releasing the almighty cracken I hear the door open to the bathroom area followed by 5 giggling girls. 

I finished my business and sat there for another 5 minutes hoping they would give up and leave allowing me to sneak back into the office. 

They didn’t, I came out followed by the most fowl stench humanly imaginable and had to awkwardly wAsh my hands while they silently argued over who would go in first. 

I don’t think I will ever forget this. "

Look across the room and a girl I know is just fixated right on my groin region with a look like she just saw a ghost (or the underside of a penis for the first time), then immediately we make eye contact and she sprints out of the room. Not 100% sure, but my dick very well could’ve peeked out in 1st period that morning. "
