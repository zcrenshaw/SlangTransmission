"WOW kid you just got r/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀

""Wooosh"" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke ""woooshes"" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as ""Schadenfreude,"" which means ""harm-joy"" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂"
