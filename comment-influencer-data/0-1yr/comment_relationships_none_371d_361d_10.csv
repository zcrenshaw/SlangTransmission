"He sent a picture of *your* daughter to another woman calling it *her* baby. He sent her videos explaining how he hates you. There is absolutely zero, hear me, zero chance of reconciliation. You deserve so much better and you will *never* get it from this man. Speak to a divorce attorney this week. "
"""Hey, I didn't cheat on you, you should thank me!...Okay, I did cheat on you, but not as much as my friends cheated, so you should still thank me!! I plan on cheating on you again, but first let me see if I can coerce you into an open relationship to assuage my own guilt about cheating on you--aren't I so considerate?!?""

&amp;#x200B;

He's selfish and immature. I would dump him. "
Part of being a supportive partner is calling out your partner when they are being a shithead.
"As a fellow orchestral musician...she has to know you just don’t do this. Honestly I’m surprised the conductor didn’t shut this down the first time she did it. Or the people around her didn’t ask her to stop since they are trying to tune...although yea maybe bringing this up given your ages is weird since I can’t remember having to say this to someone since middle school. 

Just tell her to cut it out, tuning isn’t excerpt time. Years of practice make us (well at least most of us) quite receptive to constructive criticism 

Edit:word"
My startup is failing and I also blame you.
"&gt;But also, what are my next moves?

You call a divorce lawyer, first thing, BEFORE YOU TELL HIM YOU KNOW.

&gt;I honestly don't want to give up on us, we've been together so long and I'm wondering if maybe I could be doing better? Maybe I'm boring now? 

This isn't about you. If he was unhappy with you, he could and should have addressed that. He's not cheating because of you, he's cheating because of who he is. That's not something you have any control over.

&gt;What do I do?

**Call a divorce lawyer BEFORE YOU TALK TO HIM.**

Any time you get cold feet, reread this:

&gt;He even sent her pictures of him with our daughter and saying ""your babies miss you"", and even just videos and pictures of our daughter.

That is *horrifying*."
"

&gt;* Finally, my mom said that our daughter would not be proud of my wife and I, and how we are choosing to address my parents.

How DARE they. 

This is just beyond the pale. In your situation I would be absolutely furious. 

This is not just insensitive, this is them being so self-centred that they're taking the most traumatic thing that can happen as a parent and _twisting the knife_ to try and justify their behaviour. There wasn't even a logical contribution to the argument, it was just ""we're right, and also remember your dead daughter? She hated you.""

Even if they apologised as soon as they said it, I would be seriously reevaluating having someone like that in my life."
Open it waaaaay up.  Tell him he can kiss whomever he pleases - except for you.  
I’d be way more worried about him leaving the house in the middle of the night and refusing to tell you where he’s going. That sounds like the real issue here.
"This same thing happened to me about ten years ago. My husband forgot to put the stickers on when I was in Florida for a month. I got pulled over on Christmas Eve. I was able to go to court and show them proof of registration, and they dropped it. It was a huge hassle, but it didn’t cost me much to get taken care of. I would absolutely go to court and fight it. And make sure hubby goes with you, even if he has to take off work, since this is ultimately his fault. "

"He said he’s going to do it in the future. He has friends that cheat. He doesn’t actually respect you. 

You know what he wants? Steady sex between conquests. Know what you’re gonna get? Less self esteem and an STD. 

Also wtf? This dude cheated on you. Drop him. You are too young for this shit. "
"PLEASE read this!!!

I was in almost your exact same position. A wealthy and traditional father who secretly looked down upon my husband, who passed up a decent paying career to follow his passion (teaching.) 

Father offered me $200,000 to purchase our first home outright with the only condition being the husband sign a waiver of ownership. 

Husband balked. I balked. But ultimately we accepted the deal. After ten years of happy marriage I thought ""ha! I wonder if  father feels silly now?"" 

Guess what? We are getting divorced. 

Things happen. Your father is wise. Seek an attorney's advice and tell your husband that if he has another way to come up with the money then so be it but otherwise sign the papers. "
"So you refused to hook this woman up with your friend and she's responded by trying to destroy your reputation and marriage?

I'd just quit now. These people sound like way too much trouble."
"Take screenshots. Write out a record of events. Talk to your parents or the school, not her parents. An adult should convey these things to them. If you tell them, they'll go into ""protect her from consequences"" mode. If other people know then consequences will follow. "
"The corporations know that people do this.  It's part of why they do it.  They would rather have you and all of your friends on a ""discounted"" plan than have just you and maybe some of them.

In short, your BF is being very naive, and a little bit absurd.  "
"Ashley is the one being a bully. I’d make it clear to Ashley that her behavior is what Chloe needs to get away from. They can’t both live with you because Ashley is being an ass to Chloe. (I would not go so far as to blame Chloe’s anorexia on Ashley, though.) 

I’d also maybe try to find Ashley a new therapist. I know she’s going through a lot, but her behavior to Chloe is unacceptable."
"I doubt he only sent pictures. He gets off work at 3 and gets the daughter before OP gets home at 6. So between 3-6 pm he is hanging out with the mistress AND the daughter, hence the ""your babies miss you!"" "
Can you talk to your parents and reassure them that you do not share your brother's entitlement? Tell them you'd be super grateful for ANY car and that you will respect their final say in who gets to use any car they'd be gracious enough to give to you. If they don't want to allow your brother to drive the car that's perfectly reasonable and would probably take him down a few notches.
"There's no easy fix. Contact him and clarify: ""Noah, did you ask me out on a date or are we going out as friends?"" It's going to hurt him regardless. The less time you allow him to dream about this, the fewer fantasies he can build. Likely, rejection is the end of your friendship, but it's more fair that way than him sticking around to think he'll eventually have a chance. "
"The Narcissist's Prayer


&gt;That didn't happen.

&gt;And if it did, it wasn't that bad.

&gt;And if it was, that's not a big deal.

&gt; And if it is, that's not my fault.

&gt; And if it was, I didn't mean it.

&gt; And if I did... You deserved it.

The BF is on Step 5. Step 6 is closer than you think, OP."
"Crystal ball says ""This is not the only issue in your relationship."""
"You don't reassure her of shit.  She's irrational and completely inappropriate trying to involve you her relationship problems.  You know who's problem this is?  John's.  Stop responding or engaging with her aside from a brief but firm statement that you don't want to be contacted by her any further.  Inform John that she's sending you these messages, and that you have no interest in his private life but it's making you uncomfortable and you want it to stop.  

Stop ""solving"" this problem.  If you make her uncomfortable in social settings, then she can stay home.  If she doesn't want John working with you, that's John's problem, not yours.  If either one of them involve you in their personal lives, shut it down immediately and with finality.  If John dumps her because she's insane and embarrassing him professionally, good for him, but it's not your business.

John is a coworker, not a ""real"" friend.  You can have a friendly, productive relationship with him at work, but clearly his life outside work is a sort of sucking swamp that you don't want to be anywhere nearby.  Tell her to leave you alone and go about your business."
"This is what we call musical masturbation. 

Like *actual* masturbation... 
a) Yes, it makes you feel good but... 
b) It's really very rude to do in front of other people without, least of all, prior discussion or involving them... 

While part of a group setting, it's like having your hand down your trews when someone's asked you to pass the salt at dinner. Yes, well done! You have hands that you can masturbate with, but said hands could and should contribute to the group by *passing the damn salt*. Don't be that musician. 

Basically, save it for for your own private time or a pre-agreed setting.

"&gt; First, I'm not trying to woo my dance instructor. I am a teenager. I have a crush. It is my first crush. It is embarrassing. I'll get over it.

I don't know why, but this part of the update made me the happiest. I'm glad he enjoyed your gifts and got a kick out of it, that's awesome too. The robot/light up glasses made me smile. But just reading about a teenager that's level headed and aware is awesome. Good on you!"
"
&gt; -  Finally, my mom said that our daughter would not be proud of my wife and I, and how we are choosing to address my parents. *(note: our daughter passed away after birth last year; my mom saying this only made this situation worse)*

I don't even have words to describe how unacceptable that is. Fuck your mom, and your dad, and your brother for trying to manipulate you and your wife. 

This is scorched earth territory. I would absolutely recommend cutting them out of your lives. 

I'm sorry for you and your wife's loss. "
"&gt; I regularly get insulted by her 

This would - alone - be a red flag for me. Then it was all invented. Dunno dude...

&gt; I've never met any friends or family of hers

Are you sure you're not her side?"

"Alice got caught out being an asshole and she is trying to weasel out of it. You're freaking teens, all of you have fucked up hormones and most of you probably manage to not drag your friends on the internet for months on end.

Let me guess, you were either the only Target or it was a pretty tight selection of people she could get away with picking on?"
"Wow. Your brother apparently learned how to be a total and complete asshole from your parents. Thank God Lucy moved away and got the fuck away from them. 

Lucy is doing the exact right thing by setting clear boundaries with your parents. They behave like adults and be kind to her, or they will lose that relationship. They have a choice, so they'd better figure it out quick.

As for you, I would reach out to Lucy separately. Send her a message that you know that your parents are behaving extremely inappropriately and that you are not in agreement with them. Perhaps you'll still be able to have a relationship with your niece and nephew once she cuts off your parents."
"Sounds like she may have experienced some bullying and targeted social exclusion. Experiencing it to that degree isn’t the most common, but it absolutely can happen.

I’d say it’s something to be aware of and sensitive to, but from what you’ve described it doesn’t read as a red flag to me. "
"Are you sure her ""passive investments"" aren't debt that she's hiding from you?"
"&gt; Anyway we concluded that he accepts I'm not interested in a relationship with him, he asked about being friends

Oh man, in a meeting about his conduct with you. This guy isn't too quick on the draw."
"Are you serious!?

Not only did he betray YOU.... emotionally. physically. Mentally.

But he used your DAUGHTER as fodder for his cheating. Sending pics and saying ""your babies miss you."" 

This is beyond disgusting. There is no  saving this. This guy has zero moral compass and TRIED TO GET BACK WITH HER A WEEK AGO. What do you think there is worth saving here?

Kick him out. Find a lawyer. But most importantly find a therapist who you can work with on your self esteem and self worth issues. Because you deserve wayyyyyyyy more than this. And you should know that. And act accordingly. "
"You, separately from your parents, cultivate a civil relationship with Lucy and try to be a good uncle to the kids."
"The minute you mentioned plantation, I frowned while reading. It didn't take long for me to pick up that your friend is black and hell yes, as a black woman myself I would *also* back out of a wedding taking place where my people were enslaved and worked to death!

**You are WRONG. She is RIGHT.** Full stop, this is a big deal!!

You wouldn't consider having a wedding at a concentration camp, would you? Understand what you're asking of her and that you risk alienating other friends who are uncomfortable with your decision to have a ""pretty"" wedding venue marred with a history of death, exploitation of slaves, and *suffering*.

Think on that! **While you're walking down the aisle you are walking in the same steps that chattel slaves of African descent who were whipped, brutalized, raped, and worked until their deaths did just 150 years ago.** For reference of how *recent* a legacy that is, my great-grandfather was born around 1918 which is 100 years ago and *I knew him as a child!*"
I think you should be a lot more worried about his violent drinking behavior than some hilarious drunken ramble about how he hasn't lived up to his own expectations.
"37 years old and she responds with ""have fun"" and a social media block? Lol is it fun dating a teenager?"
"Family plans aren't for just for families. In businesses, there are discounts for groups too – e.g. multiple people on a dropbox account. The reason is that the more people share an account, the more likely they are to keep using it – it's a lot more work for a bunch of people to switch to a different solution. 

Seriously, you could call these companies and tell them you're not a family, and they won't give a shit. It's about groups, not literal families."

"How can you refuse without angering him?  What kind of question is that?  You should be in full Cersei Lannister mode, consolidating power and making allies!  His feelings are his problem.  A new queen sits on the throne of the Anime Club, and she does not suffer fools!"
"Three steps.

First : Do not engage. You are no contact beyond civilities with this man now. If he starts interrogating you when you go home, say you are tired and need to go to bed now. Ignore everything he says after that, just go into your room, close the door. Get yourself a lock, if you don't have one already, so you can be absolutely sure he doesn't follow you or go there when you are not home.

No shared meals. No talking. You say good morning and good night and that's it. If he talks to you, you are busy and need to study alone in your room. If he talks to you whilst you are in a shared space and you can't leave (e.g. because you are cooking in the shared kitchen), you need to concentrate on your task and can't talk. Ignore him. You don't answer his questions about where you went or what you did. Remove him from your social media.

ANY information and interaction will further whatever delusions he has about you being his friend or wingman or partner in his quest of getting laid or doing other weird shit. It will get worse the more you engage.

Second: Talk to your housing department. Try to find a way to swap houses. There must be emergency protocol in place. Press until they give you that, even if they tell you they can't move you at first. State that you feel unsafe, creeped out, and extremely uncomfortable. If they don't give an immediate response, call after a few days, remind them of your case. If worse comes to worst, threaten to inform student newspapers, the student union, the person you are talking to's superior, a complaints department. Let the person you are talking to give you their name so you can threaten a personalised complaint directly against them, that will motivate them more. Stay calm and civil throughout even threats of complaints.

Third: Rule 1 should already cover that you don't talk to this man about women and girls, but Rule 3 also says that no female human walks into your flat from now on unless you can be absolutely, 100%, beyond a shadow of a doubt be certain that he is not there for the entire duration of her stay, EVEN if you will be with her for its entirety. For you, he is a creep and makes you feel uncomfortable. For women, this kind of man is an actual danger. He is what assault is made of. Do NOT get any woman into his vicinity, since you WILL be risking her safety and well-being.

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck. You seem like a lovely, considerate fellow and the fact that his creepiness, especially the parts of it directed against women, cause you to want to stand up to him really means a lot to me as a woman."
"Here’s my immature, mean girl advice: don’t give Megan power by saying she’s being unkind to Jessie. If it comes up again, tell her she’s being socially awkward and embarrassing. Tell Adam she’s been so odd and so rude the last few times you’ve been out that you don’t really want to hang out with her. Tell him you found it really weird and uncomfortable that she implied Jessie might find her a threat to your relationship."
That guy needs therapy.
"Yeah, usually in an orchestra usually someone says, ""can you fucking not?"" There's warm-up time and tuning time. Those are two very different things. "
"I think a good place to start is not worrying about sounding interest**ing**, and start sounding interest**ed**. If you start off with small questions about their weekend plans, their dog, any planned holidays, (all the usual small talk stuff) and really engage with the topic, you will naturally start to build up a level of comfort and familiarity.

Also it is important not to read too much into what people do - e.g. they wait for you because they want to and they're not inconvenienced by it. If they had somewhere to be then they would be there already.

Hopefully this makes a little sense. I'm socially awkward too, and it helps when other people take the lead with making plans etc., and I just follow along. Don't feel like you are weird if you don't want to be the extroverted centre of the group - circles of friends need all sorts of people :)"
"It's the responsibility of the conductor to address things like this. But if you'd like to save her the embarrassment, you should say something.

As an aside, this is... very basic communication. 5 years is a long time to be together and not be comfortable bringing up a tiny issue."
OMG- thanks for this.  I needed a good laugh this morning!
"One guy had the same problem as you before. 

He got a set of speakers and whenever they started being 'too loud' he put it against the wall and played ""The Monster Mash"" and they quickly got the idea. 

This would work for camming too because who wants to pay someone for private content while hearing IT WAS A MONSTER MASH..."
"Seriously the leaving between 1am and 3am and getting mad when you ask, is waaay worse than the FB messages. Which are pretty sketchy too."
"PRE-TEXTED LOLOLOLOL

Do you have anyone who can help you move your stuff? He might be less likely to cause a scene if you're not alone.
"He didn't approach you directly, so do nothing. Continuing working as planned. If he does bring it up with you directly, let him know you need to work to be able to afford school and let him know you will continue to do so. He can't make you quit if there isn't anything in the academic program that requires you don't have a job outside of school. "
"I'm not going to tell you to suck it up and be stuck in a job you hate, living in a place you don't love, building zero equity, so that your husband can have a job he loves and live in his favorite possible place... in exchange for housework?

In one of your comment replies, you state that he's unwilling to move to a different island on the chain because it's too crowded and will slightly dampen his enjoyment of his hobbies. If you are in a situation where you are financially unable to own a home for years due to the COL of your husband's dream location and the low pay of your husband's dream job, it's completely fair to ask to move to *anywhere* where you can actually prepare financially for retirement. You asked him to move to a slightly worse island paradise, and he wouldn't consider it. 

Your dad isn't driving a wedge between you, he's just highlighting it. You want to own a home but you can't afford one because your husband wants to have the perfect life. Now, an option shows up that will allow you both to get what you want without making any lifestyle changes, but out of principle, your husband would rather things continue the way that they are, since he doesn't care about owning a house. At some point, this was going to be an issue. It's better to deal with it now than down the road."
"Tell her that you think she looks beautiful in anything, but that you want her to be comfortable. If she would feel more comfortable with more material in the back, you can do that for her. "
"This is a common practice of the affluent in the business world. Take no-name, possibly down on their luck humans who are smarter than they are given credit for / aware of themselves, and USE them as their primary workhorse / “right hand man/woman” while the said affluent business person continues to behave in ways that are really just unacceptable. 

Basically, he picked you because he felt he could mold you. You represent something / have traits that he feels are valuable, and he had you under his thumb. Paradigm shift, now he doesn’t. The only blowback you can suffer is if you do as he asks and regret it, and leave him. Trust me, these men don’t like it when that happens. Or if you try and play his game (spoiler alert - he will be better at it then you, and will also have access to mentors that are better at it than he is), and lose. So honestly your best bet is to clam up. Stay his friend. But say your hands are tied. You are uncomfortable stepping down. You’re sorry this happened, but you’re being asked to do a job and you’re going to do it.

Do not play his game. Stick to your guns. Be professional. Do not gossip. It’s a tall order, but if you can maintain your work ethic and “what got you here” (besides him, obviously) you will be fine. DO NOT PLAY GAMES.

Good luck."
"""because doing those things would make him feel controlling and he doesn’t want to tell me what I should wear""

""when he tells me I'm fat and he doesn't like a single one of my shirts""

He's already controlling. He's controlling the way you view yourself, thus the way you want to dress, and therefore the way you will dress, but you're not seeing it because apparently he's great in almost every other way and he's said, aloud, that he doesn't want to be controlling (read: he doesn't want you to view him as controlling, although he is). He's already there. He's abusing you and this is not healthy."
"Please prioritize Chloe. She can die from this.

On the other hand, it doesn't matter even if you are right; your friend is absolutely committed to not listening to reason.

He just doesn't with you. Relationships aren't all about being comfortable all the time. Its about compromise and caring enough about the other person to want to make them happy. You have mentioned tons of sacrifices for him and the relationship and you haven't mentioned one that he has made. 

Seems to me he knows you'll just go along with everything. 

You are only 27 years old. You dont have to give up kids and a marriage and a fun fulfilling relationship for someone who doesn't even want to meet your family. "

"One, well done.

Two, this is not your problem anymore, yay, but:

He seemed kinda angry but he couldn't really do anything with the RD in the room watching and all he could do was constantly ask that.

He knows exactly what he's doing and he's had problems with it before, and his parents know about it. That's what that means.

"Yikessss as a full-time professional violinist, this is pretty much the rudest *possible* thing you can do during the tuning note. I can’t believe nobody has called her on this yet. You should definitely tell her because I’ve seen people get released from gigs and not called back ever again because of stunts like that. 

Tuning up has very specific instructions and kind of an unspoken code of conduct. The goal of tuning is to...tune. It isn’t warmup time, or show off time. My rule (and the golden orchestral standard) of tuning is to do it as quickly and quietly as possible. Even during tuning while playing your open strings, you shouldn’t want to play too loudly because it’s rude to those around you (and if you’re pressing too hard it can negatively affect your actual tuning anyway.) What she is doing is rude, counterproductive, and if I ever saw that shit in a gig I contracted for I would probably discreetly dismiss that person and tell others not to hire her.

If she wants to warm up with soloist pieces, that’s her right (though in most professional scenarios, that will get a huge eyeroll as well to be honest. Warming up with pieces like that is wholly unnecessary and pretty much just attention-seeking behavior.) But as a favor to her and any professional future she may want you should tell her right away. If you want feel free to show her this comment or I’ll even talk to her because I’m literally cringing thinking about this bush league shit she’s pulling. Sorry if that sounds harsh but it’s tough love —if she’s a talented player that just doesn’t know any better than I would hate for her to lose opportunities over something that she just doesn’t know better about."
"Sounds to me you’ve been adopted by a fantastic new family.  Slowly back away from your heinous bio-family, and truly embrace your adopted parents.

You have already hit the big time, stop and smell the roses. 

You’ve arrived."
"He's definitely into you. It doesn't matter that he hasn't broken any rules, he shouldn't be making you feel uncomfortable in your own dorm. You should explicitly turn him down (Chris, I am not interested in dating you) and speak to your RA/CA/whatever your college calls it. Part of their job is to manage relationships between students. A record of his behavior and of you reporting it will be useful if it continues or escalates. "
"You also need to explain that to Ashley that, while you understand that her hormones are all over the place, she is still actually an adult now. She needs to grow up and start acting like one.

"My parents just went through a divorce.

The divorce lasted **FIVE FUCKING YEARS** and cost both my parents **NEARLY 100 GRAND**

This all happened because my mom wasn't strong enough to just act on anything. She was convinced my dad couldn't be so bad.

Please believe what I am about to say. This will save you time and money. I can't say that this won't break your heart so please be sure you are strong enough to start the divorce proceedings. 

1. Seek consultations from no less than 3 divorce attorneys immediately. Tell them exactly what this girl showed you and tell them what you want. "" I have pictures and video of my husband being explicit with another woman"". ""I have video and pictures of my husband saying how much he hates me"" ""I have pictures of him showing our child to other women.

2. DO NOT tell your husband ANYTHING. **your husband cannot know about the divorce until he is served his papers**. This sounds like a shitty thing to do, and maybe it is, but the legal system favors the first person to act. 

3. If your lawyer says something **DO IT**. My mom wouldn't listen to her lawyers and ended up shooting herself in the foot so many times. 

Your best bet would be to get your lawyer to write up some terms, have you both agree to split everything 50/50, you get the child, and you divorce immediately. Hopefully being hit with all that at once will convince him he can't win and just be done with it. 

Whatever you do don't draw out the battle. Lawyers fees add up VERY quickly."
"&gt;my mom said that our daughter would not be proud of my wife and I, and how we are choosing to address my parents. (note: our daughter passed away after birth last year; my mom saying this only made this situation worse)

Unless they have a serious 180 in personality and become absolute angels, you need to cut them the fuck out like the tumours they are. They're not just overstepping and intruding, they are deliberately manipulating you and actively trying to hurt you and your wife. Do you get it now? **YOUR PARENTS ARE HURTING YOU AND YOUR WIFE ON PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR WAY.** What kind of fucking awful person says this to someone who has lost a child? A bully, that's who.

Which brings us to our next question: what kind of husband accepts this behaviour and allows people in his life who are this cruel to his wife? Answer: A shitty husband. Make your decision, and remember that your options are losing your parents, or losing your wife.

Edit: Couple of words"
"Hi! Congratulations on doing so well on your exam. I was also the first person from my immediate family to attend college, and I know how hard it can be to walk an unpaved road. It's even more difficult without support. You should be very proud of what you have already accomplished and what you are working toward.

I have always found that when my family told me I was book smart, but not street smart, they were seriously just unable to watch me rise above the situation I was born into (being flat broke) without being bitter. They wanted to bring me down, because me getting out there and doing it ruined all their excuses of why it wasn't possible for them. 

If you care, it's hard to just say ""don't care."" There's no simple solution to just not caring. But honestly, sit down and figure out why it matters to you. Why do you care if they call you a nerd or say you study too much? Being a ""nerd"" and studying is going to take you to achieving your goals, and doing something none of them were able to do. It also sounds like you aren't spending all your time studying; you're getting a well-rounded experience... so they're wrong.

"Your husband is having some major difficulties dealing with his trauma and should see a therapist. For whatever reason, this either does not impact his life outside of home or he's just able to mask it there. 

&gt; He says he can't stand what the injury has done to him and I should be grossed out.

This says it all. He is embarrassed, frustrated, and grossed out by his own body. Perhaps the lack of intimacy with the outside world enables him to put that aside but it's resulting in him pursuing a lack of intimacy with you as well. Insist on going to counseling together. I have faith he can start to change his mindset about his leg and put this behind him. "
"One great rule that you might be able to bring up at a calm opportunity is  ""Let's not make new rules when we're angry""

Or *alternatively* ""let's not decide on punishments when we're angry"". It's very satisfying and rewarding to always be in the right, but what's ""right"" is very different in the moment and after the dust has settled."
"&gt;So I asked my husband to put the new stickers on the license plates. He texted me back maybe an hour later say ""all taken care of.""

&gt;I asked him why he didn't put the stickers on, he said he just forgot. I asked him why he told me he put the stickers on the plate, he said he ""pre-texted"" and meant to get to it.

So he lied to you, his lie caused a stressful and expensive thing to happen to you, and his response is basically ""shit happens?"" What?

I have to ask, is this a part of a larger pattern where he disregards your feelings? I'd feel terrible if I caused my partner to get $1300 in tickets, to say nothing of the lie. I can't imagine this is an isolated incident.

Did he even apologize? What is your honest opinion of why he lied about putting the sticker on the car?"
"Yes, you should be worried. This is some massively shady shit and you should not be cool with it. Expect him to try and manipulate and gaslight you about it, cause it seems that's what he wants to do. I wonder if she even knows he has a gf. Talking to her on the phone late at night? Fuck no. Ang guy that loves and respects you would want you to feel at ease in the relationship and would WANT you to meet this new friend especially if you were uncomfortable about her.

Sounds like shit bf and either currently cheating (physical or emotionally) or he will soon."

"Does your husband have a golden, vibrating dick or something? Why did you marry him and why did you agree to move away from your family and friends for him and give up your career? Because he doesn't sound like he was worth it and it sounds like you're realizing that now and *that's* what you're not recovering from.

Like, it'd be one thing if you gave all that stuff up for an amazing partner who was your best friend and confidant. But the guy didn't even notice you dropped *30 pounds* in a year? He just yelled at you for buying new jeans? He said he's allowed to look at other women when you're jobless (because he moved you away from your job)?

He sounds horrible."
"As long as switching roommates is 100% not an option (and I highly encourage you to beat that dead horse on whether that's the case), here are a couple things you could try. Note: all my suggestions really suck for you but since your roommate isn't going to change his ways, you unfortunately will have to change yours. 

1.) ALWAYS keep your door locked to your room. When you sleep, when studying, when you leave. I'm not saying your roommate will necessarily do something weird but you want to protect your safe space as much as possible. If you don't have the key to your door to lock from the outside, ask your landlord. If you can't lock it from the outside, see what external locking options are available, install when your roommate isn't around, and just uninstall/patch the door to get security back.

2.) Get a mini fridge and hot plate (if allowed) or microwave/toaster oven for your room. In a college town you can probably find these things keep cheap on college Facebook pages or Craigslist. Eliminate the need to linger in shared spaces as much as possible.

3.) Don't invite friends over. You don't want your roommate trying to latch onto your friend group like he's done to you.

4.) Try to learn his schedule to avoid him. Don't obviously be a stalker about it but take note of when he comes and goes so you can get a feeling of what night's you can walk in casually without worrying about him and what nights you might want to hang longer at a friend's

5.) freeze him out. Sounds like you're doing this already by clearly telling him no. That's awesome. Continue with that and keep interactions very surface. Don't talk really about what's up with you and then bounce as soon as you can. If he follows you, say yo dude really gotta study and stop engaging till he gets bored.

Honestly, writing this out I feel like this sounds kinda extreme. Maybe others will support less ride or die methods, including yourself. But whatever you do, just try your best to focus on you and your studies. Good luck!"
"Tell Carol directly. “I think you understand that I have no issue with you, personally. I lost my mother and things changed very quickly. In any situation however, it would be inappropriate for you to wear her clothing. I’m asking you from my heart: please don’t. I know you’d never want to purposely hurt anyone so I’m asking you to make sure that doesn’t happen. I’d be happy to come by and pick up those items.”

"I can try that. This happened all last night so it a pretty fresh argument. They've gone out for dinner with friends. They should be back by ten at the latest. I think it's six now, so a few hour and I can talk to them. 

I don't know why he would open his fat mouth when it effects both of us. My parents are a lot stricter than my aunt and uncle. They're not overly strict. If I got drunk, that would be my party privileges gone for a while. If my cousin gets drunk, my aunt and uncle don't care. 

I just don't understand why he thought it would be a good idea to tell Mom that she doesn't make as much money as dad, so she shouldn't be involved in choosing our car. "
"“Hey guys! Let’s get this clarified early in the year. It’s been brought to my attention that you’d rather not share pots and pans. No problem! Currently many of my items (dishes, food, etc) are being shared. To make things easier for everyone going forward, should we all just make sure we use our own stuff and not share? Or do we want to ensure we keep things clean and share all kitchen items except food? Let me know which of those options works best, I’m open to either!”

You’re living with petty jerks so you’ll need to get used to being immediately assertive with a big smile on your face. Like a teacher with the problem child. Big smile, assertive language. Be direct. Those are the expectations and options: share or don’t but it will go both ways. "
"If it’s something that doesn’t make you comfortable, you should definitely talk with her about these issues. She might be picking out your outfits because that’s what her mom did for her dad, and she views it as a form of love/ taking care of her partner.  From your description of how she acts around your friends, it kinda seems just like she is proud of you and want to show you off. Since these are things she does often, she probably doesn’t realize it bothers you. Just be open and honest with her about how those things make you feel. Maybe she can pick out an outfit once a week for you instead and if she wants to praise you, do it in private and not in front of your friends. "
"Tell him he’s allowed to drive it when he’s proven he can take care of his own car properly for a year- clean, no dings or dents, proper care, no speeding, etc. He will never be able to do it, I guarantee you.

Try looking for a new therapist for Ashley if she claims the one she's seeing isn't helping her make the progress she wants. She needs a professional to help her sort out whatever is making her take out all her aggression on her fellow human beings and inanimate objects and redirect that energy.

I don't think you're failing your siblings at all. I think you're doing the best you can with the resources you have, and that you'd be going above and beyond for both of them by taking one in while still being sure to regularly visit the other.

"&gt; That those kinds of deals exist so people can get their kids on their phone plans, or to the pool, or something, without spending exorbitantly

I think you should get out now. It’ll be hard, but it will still be easier than leaving later when your lives are more intertwined and you have a relationship with his kid too. 

Being a step-mom is a huge responsibility. Do you really think that you’d be able to maintain your distance from the kid when he has it? Or be all in? Because it’s not really fair to anyone to half-heartedly involve yourself in this child’s life. 

Leaving is the easiest thing to do and, personally, I think it’s the wisest for you. "

"&gt; so it hurts when he tells me I’m fat 

am i the only one who noticed this? OP this is what we call ""burying the lede."" he's not just insulting your taste or sense of fashion -- he's degrading *you, as a person*.

&gt; So I’ve asked him multiple times to help me pick out some new clothes, or to give me new clothes for my birthday, or even just to give me some style guidelines to work with so I can pick things out myself, but he refuses, because doing those things would make him feel controlling and he doesn’t want to tell me what I should wear.

pretty sure he crossed that line by calling you fat and insulting the way you look *every single day*. he is already controlling. he is already telling you what to wear -- it's to wear something that's not what you're wearing.

it doesn't matter what you wear. he will not tell you what he wants you to wear because it's not the clothes that are the issue. he's gas lighting you."
"Parents don’t need to get involved because they won’t prioritize the best interests of the students being bullied, and that’s who you should be concerned about. Collect proof and send it anonymously to her school via several different avenues: principal, guidance counselors, etc. The more people you send it to, the more difficult it is to ignore. Sometimes the head of the school tries to brush negative things under the rug because they don’t want to deal with the potential bad press that could come from it, so sending it to other authority figures in the school is a good idea.

"Just graduated from med school in May. I’d talk to her and make sure she’s done her research and knows what prerequisite classes she needs to apply and what MCAT score/GPA she needs to have a decent shot, not to mention the extracurricular activities and shadowing/clinical experiences most applicants have. She also should be able to articulate to you a good reason for why she wants to do this, because she’ll need to be able to tell an interviewer a cohesive story about why she wants to do medicine.

And yes the applications are expensive, I applied to more than 20 schools when I applied and it’s only gotten more competitive. My (average to slightly above average) med school’s website lists the school as having a 5% overall acceptance rate, so many applicants apply to several schools to better their chances. Some of my classmates went through three or four application cycles of 25-30 schools each year before they got accepted. 

I wonder if maybe she’s unsatisfied with her job or some other aspect of her life and she’s just looking for some sort of drastic change. "
"His GF gave him an ultimatum, I guarantee it. "
"Something is off here. I wouldn’t mention it or ever bring it up, I’m not convinced it was actually her friend sending that message "
"Yes! And this makes it extra hypocritical that they're harping on respect and sensitivity.

Remember: When people like your parents say things like ""if you don't respect me, I won't respect you,"" what they really mean is ""if you don't treat me as your superior, I won't treat you like a human being."" Their version of respect means that they can do (or make you do) whatever they want to, and you're not even allowed to be hurt by it let alone disagree. "
"&gt;My question is, is this something I should let go because maybe he was half awake and doesn't remember it? 

Fuck. No. He showed you his true colors only 4 months in, consider it a gift (that he showed you, not that he did it) and get the hell away before you invest more time or emotion into this.

It doesn't make it better if he abuses you without realizing it."

"Hormones are no excuse. There is no excuse. It may be “anonymous” in the sense that your name isn’t used, but what your friend did is cruel and not fair. You didn’t give her permission to share your picture or details about you, and certainly not to insult you. Blaming it on her hormones and her struggles being transgender is cruel because it’s playing on your empathy as a friend towards her struggles to get away with what is cyber bullying. Getting other friends to gang up on you for overreacting is some of the most gaslight-y nonsense I’ve seen on this sub. She’s no friend of yours if she thinks it’s ok to talk to anyone like that, much less you."
"I used to date a guy who never fully let me in. The final straw for me was also a wedding. It wasn't even one that was super important to me, like a sibling's wedding. But after he bailed on countless other social situations where I really wanted him with me (including getting dinner with my family on my own birthday) I just was done. I was a bridesmaid but I only knew the bride and groom, who of course were busy the whole time, so I spent the night sitting alone with no one to talk to. The worst part was when I got dragged out to the floor for the bouquet toss. I tried to tell people that I wasn't single but no one actually believed me.

I broke up with him a few weeks later. It hurt at the time but almost immediately I felt relief. You will too. After all, being alone really isn't that lonely. But feeling alone while in a relationship? *That's* a loneliness that'll really get to you. "
"What’s done is done, and the chips will fall where they may. My main advice is just draw your line in the sand, and be pleasant but firm. You want to move forward with your life, and if he is ok with status quo, that’s ok with you. At least now you will know. "
"To add to this, it sounds like she’s close with her family. I thinks it’s fairly normal for introverts to have only one or a couple close friends, and maybe for her, her sister fills that roll?

"I was on the other end of this. My boyfriend was 21 and his mom constantly tracked his location. If we were like, “we’re going to whataburger” and then deviated off course and got Chinese we would be getting a call. I lived an hour away so we were going back and forth and we would turn it off and get his phone blown up until he caved and turned it off. He did every his mom and dad told him to do and it ruined our relationship. I conceived while on an IUD and had a tragic miscarriage where I almost lost my uterus because IUD perforated my uterus. He never told his parents and couldn’t see me because they told him he had to go to his cousins baptism. I was in a hospital damn near bleeding to death. So instead of coming to me when I needed him most he did what mommy told him. He made me snap him about it so they didn’t read his texts and find out. I told him to grow up and broke it off and never spoke to him again. You need to get ahead of this. "
"It's suspicious. Trust your gut.

&gt; Recently though Ive been trying really hard to have him let me meet her to see if meeting her will help me feel less uncomfortable with her.

You can say, ""I think you are absolutely beautiful regardless, but I want to feel comfortable. What would you like to do? We can adjust the dress to include a mesh back, we can find a matching cardigan or capelet, or we can choose an entirely new dress. What would make you feel most comfortable?""

That way, she's learning, ""my scars bother me, but I don't have to let it impact my life. And Auntie respects me."""
That's what I'm worried about. I don't think I've ever seen her parents punish her for anything. They won't hear a bad word about her.

 I wouldn't involve your parents. They'll be forced to tell you not to do stuff as to not risk scholarships / family dynamics. But, you have enough agency and independence to do what is right on your own. Still, keep it as anonymous as you can."

It's gonna hurt. Seek counseling, even if it's just for the first initial weeks or months. Find support in things you overlooked before, parents, friends, church, etc.

3. Show your utter distain for him and his floozy.

If you’ve been playing against other co-ed teams, that means there are other organizations you could join. "
"In order to be considered she'll need at least a 3.5 GPA, and at least a 510 MCAT score.  In general she'll need a also need these classes:

* 8 credit hours of biology with a lab
* 8 credit hours of chemistry with a lab
* 4 credit hours of organic chemistry with lab
* 4 credit hours of biochemistry lab not required 
* 8 credit hours of physics with lab
* 8 credit hours of calculus or statistics 
* Plus humanities courses etc.

If she doesn't have what it takes and she's not willing to let you hold her down, don't argue, but instead you should volunteer to take her to the nearest Medical school and for a sit down with the admissions department.    They'll set her straight.  "
"Oh honey. I’m so sorry someone actually took the time to do this to you. Please know that it’s a reflection on him, not on you. 

It’s okay to grieve for the person you thought existed. Isn’t that what all of us are doing when it doesn’t work out with someone? Grieving the idea of them, and what we thought it could be?

Stop being so hard on yourself. You didn’t do anything wrong. You opened your heart to someone that you thought cared about you too. Nothing in the world wrong with that. 

Next time you’ll be a little more hesitant before opening up again, and that’s a shame. But don’t let that person take away your ability to open up completely. *That* would make this a tragedy. 

I hope you feel better soon and this internet stranger is always available to you if you need an ear. Hang in there, every day will let a little easier 😘😘"
"So my father passed when I was a kid and mum started to date my stepdad about six or seven years later. My stepdad can be a jerk in other ways haha but he never competed with my dad. He’d ask us questions about him, what did dad like? What were his hobbies? He’d laugh at anecdotes and stories we’d tell and said he’d have loved to have met my dad. He suggested we have more pictures of dad around the house, took us all out on dad’s birthday and watched videos with us of dad and mum. 

He never tried to compete with a dead man, he made it clear that mum’s absolute love for my father and also for him wasn’t a contest. When mum died, we mixed her ashes with dad’s and he helped us do it. 

Your boyfriend is a fucking jerk. Get rid of him. "
"For some perspective, I am a parent of a guy in his mid twenties. I give him space and treat him like the autonomous adult that he is. He owes me nothing. I owe it to him to give him support and guidance *if he asks for it* and to enjoy the gift of his company if he freely offers it, given his busy schedule. 

You owe your parents nothing. Nothing. In contrast, you owe your wife love and respect ever since that day you stood up in public, gave her a ring, and promised that very thing. 

Stop with the endless ""talking things out"" and ""let me explain my side"" games. Just stop. 

Your parents are terrible, controlling people. They are abusive. They think that they have a God-given right to control you and your wife by any means necessary, including invoking your deceased baby. They are not doing this out of love. They don't love you. This is not love. 

You do not have proper parents. Your parents are behaving like enemies. 

Stop interacting with them. You don't want to give up on the fantasy of having parents who love you, but this fantasy is hurting your wife. 

Cut these abusers out before your wife leaves you. Look elsewhere, such as friends or even within yourself, for that nurturing they should have given you and didn't. (For the record, abuse and controlling behavior is not nurturing). 

Check out a website called Out of the FOG. Read over it thoroughly. I hope you find it helpful. 

If you can't bring yourself to cut them off just yet, then at least never mention them again to your wife and never, ever ask her to interact with them in any way whatsoever. Stop forcing her to allow them to abuse her. 

Remember, just because you want something out of other people doesn't mean that you can unilaterally cause it to happen just by wishing. I found that out the hard way back when my ex husband dumped me. I kept playing nice because I wanted him to wake up and come back. Well, he didn't. What I wanted was irrelevant. I was the one who needed to wake up. 

Continuing to subject yourself and your wife to your parents' abusive and controlling behavior and endless stupid and pointless discussions is not going to change their behavior. It hasn't yet. It never will. They are independent people who are doing whatever TF they want to do. 

You do have the choice of how you react and what kind of a life you want. "
"Yes, date him.

---

Don't let fear rule you and make you miss out on something potentially beautiful.

One thing I have learned in life is that it is rare for such guy/girl friendships to survive future relationships with other people. A few years after college, especially if you move to different cities as your lives diverge, this friendship will become less than it is now. Then when either of you dates, the SO will have a hard time being ok with your closeness, which will just kill it.

So if you want to be friends with him forever, date him."
"You sound like the dream roommate to be honest! I think they were hoping more for a roommate who fits their lifestyle/schedule/way of living. I would move when the lease is up.

"It doesn't matter how you came into office. You owe it to the other students to do your job properly and not let someone corrupt take over the role. If you have any advisors, I would speak to them. Chances are he probably can't just come back in and take over without being voted in again unless he's cleared of all misconduct charges."
"Tell him you’d love to get a job or internship in your field that compensates equally to what you are getting to cover your living expenses while completing your degree.  And then ask him what jobs are available where and when you can start and who to contact.  It’ll either open his eyes to the lack of availability/feasibility of this concept, or, more likely, get him off your back by him saying he doesn’t have time to do so and that you should do it yourself.  Then you don’t have to do anything else about it for the class.  If he asks about it further on, just say you haven’t found any openings that fit your requirements yet.

BS the hell out of it."
Easy way to lose 180 lbs: dump him. 
"First, I want to say that im so sorry this person did this to you. You don't deserve this, though deserve so much better. Repeat that to yourself, that you deserve so much better, because it's 100% truth. 

Secondly, I've actually been there. I had a boyfriend named Brian in high school that was emotionally manipulative and abusive. I left him before I graduated, and several months later my friend ""Cameron"" messaged me on Facebook. Cameron was someone I actually knew in school, and the profile looked real, so I didn't have any reason not to believe it was him. Months later, I'm falling in love with ""Cameron"" but he was doing a ""year of college in Germany"" and just really ""didn't like talking on the phone or via Skype"". So I waited for him. 

What really cleared my fog though, was that one day ""Cameron"" asked about the abortion I'd had when my ex got me pregnant. That made me freeze, because I knew for *certain* I had never told him about it. I didn't tell anyone, not my parents or my best friend, no one. I was 16 at the time, and really scared. So I did some digging on his account, realized it was only as old as his first message to me. I then found Camerons actual profile, he was engaged to be married and moved to Texas. 

I blocked Brian's fake account, and I cried for weeks. I felt sick to my stomach that someone could put in the effort to do this to me. My self confidence was shattered, and I felt broken. I felt weak, that I let this happen. 

**You are not weak. You deserve better.**"
"The fact that you said him going to a party without you was a ""big test' means you already don't trust him and shouldn't have gotten married. His behavior at the party confirms this."
Jesus you've been together 4 years and he's this possessive over 40 bucks? What's the rest of your relationship like?
"I'm wondering if they cam for income? Could explain the at all hours/overexagerrated noises. Maybe give them a nice card saying welcome to the neighborhood but please keep the early morning sesh quiet because they are waking you every time and it's affecting your job.

"Yeah, I’m sure you are right about his response.  I'm not interested in convincing someone to stay in a relationship with me. 

Last weekend we were supposed to spend some time together doing something fun since he's leaving town for the next two weeks going to a football game with his friends and for work.  Also, he'll be gone for my birthday. I threw out a suggested activity and he didn't seem interested.  I asked what time his football games would be on and he responded ""all day"".  I informed him that I was leaving to do a few errands since he didn't seem all that interested in spending time together. He seemed surprised but said he would be there when I got home in about two hours.  Surprise- he wasn't. "
"I'm not sure how normal it is but it isn't what a good relationship looks like, hell in my opinion that's not even mediocre.

"Per her edit he is on step 6. You didn't call me, so I cheated."
You don’t owe her that. She cheated. Just don’t say anything. You ex may have been testing you
Of course you're not wrong to be offended. He told you he misses sexy women in his life ffs. Have a blunt conversation about it. 
"&gt; The longest running issue is his job. He doesn't have one and decided he no longer believes in working. He read some material on the internet that he described to me on this philosophy. It comes down to a moral stance from him.

That's absolute horseshit. I bet he doesn't have a moral or philosophical objection to *you* working. 

Of course he's satisfied with you. You're his golden goose. You support him fully and you tolerate the fact that he does *nothing* to contribute to society and is now so large that he's begun breaking your furniture. 

It's okay for you to decide that these things are deal breakers. They would be for me. ""Be employed"" and ""take care of yourself"" are two very, very low bars to set in a relationship, and if your husband can't clear them...well, the writing is on the wall. I would suggest that you stop pleading with and make a demand. He needs to get a job within a set time period, and he needs to see a doctor and start working on his health. If he cannot or will not do those things, I would advise you to start getting ready to legally separate. "
"Come on. Your husband is calling another woman beautiful and wildcat,  and asking her if she likes to cuddle and what she wears to bed. He may not have fucked her yet but he wants to."
"This isn't about a kink at all. The dude straight up cheated on you. 

He totally got away with it too. He's changed the narrative from, ""I was caught red-handed cheating."" to ""Oh it's just a deep shame and vulnerability,"" and it's made you almost feel sorry for him. Like he didn't even take responsibility -- he's pretending like he almost had no choice in the matter. This guy should work in politics cause that's some professional spin. 

It's total bullshit. This guy is just a cheater. Plain and simple. You've already caught him red-handed twice -- do you seriously think that's the only time he's engaged in this behavior? For every incident you catch there's 10 more you'll never know about. 

&gt;I don’t want to just throw away an otherwise good relationship because he can’t deal with the massive amounts of shame he has about his sexuality. And maybe I’ll like being a femdom. He’s trying to let me in, I don’t want to further shame him when he’s at least trying.

I mean listen to yourself here. This is not about his ""shame of sexuality"" the dude gets off sneaking around with other women. He's not complicated or deep -- he's just really good at manipulation. He's cheated twice *that you know of* and you're sitting here feeling bad about not wanting to shame him. He shamed you when he fucking cheated. 

Just dump this guy -- I think you know deep down something's off about this and that's why you're getting the feeling to pack up and leave. You know it's bullshit -- don't let him fool you three times. "
He wants a son. What happens if you agree to have another child and it’s a girl? Then what? Do you go on having daughters until he gets his precious son? 
"If he's creeping out women this much, I'm willing to bet he's a lowkey creep when he's sober. Don't kick him, don't tell him to be cool.

""Friend, your behavior is really not acceptable. Women are literally telling me you are scaring them. I don't think we can go out and drink together anymore, because I've tried to tell you about your behavior and how it makes women and me feel uncomfortable."""
But do it privately. Call them out but don’t embarrass them in front of others. 
"Yeah you know, that's a fucking excellent point. No excuse for the way he behaves. In fact the drunken ramble was like, in defense of his behavior. I think that was what made me freak out about it. "
"First, and most importantly, he needs to get a paternity test!!!!!! It's possible the baby is not his and then all your problems go away. "

"She told you exactly what she thought and felt on the topic. You two had an agreement and you broke it. She very graciously backed out. Sorry, OP, you are in the wrong here. "
"I am so sorry, that shame you feel is totally hers.

"&gt; Ever since, we feel so uncomfortable if we are all eating together that we make sure we eat at the table.

&gt; we’re keeping people away from the house to avoid her screaming about it

The more you cater to her...eccentricities, the more you are reinforcing the fact that they *work*.

You need to live your lives the way you live your lives; it was that way before she moved in, and that was made clear to her *then*.  If she doesn't like it, she can leave.  But the more you give in and do what she wants, the more she'll step up her game to control things *more*.

&gt; if she found out that anyone had had anyone over in her absence then she would report everyone to the police for trespassing

Let her try; that will be a hoot.  All of you have a right to be there, and to have guests.  I assume that at least one of you has signed a lease saying so, yes?

"If your husband is unwilling to pay more than half of your bills, then you should tell him that you'll have to downsize your bills to what you can afford to pay. If you're paying half of a large or luxurious apt/ home, that's not really in your budget. Think about what you could reasonably pay for and what you'd need to cut out (cable, extra car, etc). If he doesn't like that, he can pay more for his lifestyle "
Your boyfriend has some growing up to do if he's worried about you being mean to corporations.
"I’d ask myself - and my partner - why he told me that now after a year of thinking about that. Why does he thinks of ending the relationship, why hasn’t he ended it already? 
If I where in your shoes, I’d think about how this information changes myself, the trust in the relationship and the emotional components. 

I like the recommendation of a relationship therapy with another therapist. He might has other thoughts and sights to the whole thing.

Initiating the breakup should only be done if you are sure you want to end the relationship. You write you had already ups and downs, so you can assess the given situation better than we can. I imagine that you are ready to help your partner with everything you can offer, which implies the initiation of the breakup. But please don’t only think of him and his needs, your needs and feelings are as important as his emotions are."
"Sounds like Pete needs to learn women aren’t objects you can call dibs on, like the biggest cookie on the plate. 

Some people take longer to grow up, but it’s also important to call them out on their shitty behaviour so that they can learn and grow. "
"Oftentimes when people start getting annoyed about their partner's minor flaws, when they might have considered it a 'quirk' at another time, is a sign of a deeper feeling of discontentment in the relationship.  Like, pent up frustration about other matters can make a person absolutely despise their partner's loud chewing, or loud laugh or that they can never find their keys etc etc.   


Is there a chance that this might just be a sort of... displaced frustration? How do you feel about the relationship in general- do you still love her as a person, do you still have fun together, do you still actively enjoy being around her?   


And what about your life outside of your relationship? Are you, perhaps, extremely stressed or displeased about something else (maybe relating to work, family, friends etc) and it's easier for you to not acknowledge that and place all of your frustrated feelings into this?

"&gt; What more can I do to prevent Beth from interfering in my life? 

Can't speak to legal action, but get your mom on board, **hard**. Why is your mom so invested in her anyway? Make it abundantly clear that if she really wants, she can have a relationship with Beth on her own time, BUT you want nothing more to do with Beth, nor do various other family members, and if Beth attends events, or turns up with your mother's blessing, implicit or explicity, you'll be staying/going home. No ifs, no buts, you've made your choice. Don't let her spin it as ""making her choose"", partly because you're not, partly because if the choice is between her own daughter and her daughter's ex-friend, **why the hell is she choosing the ex-friend?!**

It's also on your brother and sister in law to grow spines and start making sure Beth doesn't turn up, or is removed from situations. Why was your SIL silent during this whole affair? Ideally you want your mom to block Beth on Facebook, but you can't make her do things like that. But I think you're entitled to a hard conversation with your mom about why she's prioritising the feelings of a random woman over those of her children, and why she's believing her over you. Ultimately she doesn't have to *like* your decision, but she does have to accept it.

"Yeah, Lucy said she's living the rest of her life in Oregon. I think that's probably the best way to go about things. I should try to talk to her myself. "
"You should be aware how *dangerous* this is. I’m dead serious. You can get infections that easily spread to sensitive organs in your head like, say, your eyes, nose, throat, *brain*, *spinal cord*, *carotid arteries*...

He has so many reasons he *must* follow up with oral health care, primarily because if he neglects it long enough he could get himself septic or dead. 

This sounds dramatic, but as a former medical malpractice attorney, you should be aware of the serious health risks that your husband’s poor hygiene can create. For instance, almost no surgeon will perform an invasive surgery if you need a tooth pulled because of the risk of infection spreading rapidly while your body is still recovering. My grandma’s knee surgery was delayed for an abscessed tooth.

Does he want to be around for his kids? I’d start seriously asking."
Total denial. Completely.
"If my husband yelled at me in public, and called me a bitch and a cunt, abandoned me and stayed with a friend, all because my pregnant body was hungry and tired, I'd refuse to want to be around him for the rest of the trip until he MASSIVELY makes it up. I draw the line at name calling. Both of you were tired, both of you had a terrible journey, on top of that you're pregnant, and he decides he gets to verbally abuse you and leave you alone in a strange city in a strange house. You should NOT excuse this.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any friends there, meet up with them and do your own thing and enjoy the city. Let him try and make it up to you after you guys get home."
"If he knows he absolutely wants kids and wouldn’t be happy without having kids then let him go. 

Kids are the ultimate dealbreaker. There is no compromise. 

Do not have kids unless you absolutely really really want to.

I desperately wanted my baby and i love my son fully and completely. I am so happy I had him and being a parent is my most rewarding role. And it’s still *really really hard*. Nobody who isn’t fully committed should attempt it. "
"&gt; I asked what time his football games would be on and he responded ""all day"". I informed him that I was leaving to do a few errands since he didn't seem all that interested in spending time together. He seemed surprised 

Because, again, he was trying to get you to dance to his tune and you didn't. 

Move on. You can do better than this passive aggressive game playing nonsense. "
"An old boyfriend of mine used to freak out like this. My breaking point was in a Staples. 

Perfectly ordinary Tuesday. We have a business account, and we're purchasing printer paper. He can't find the business account card. Can we look it up by phone number? Great. He's punching the number in but his fingers fumble. The machine beeps its displeasure and throws up a re-prompt.

He loses it. Just for a second, but it's unmistakable. A sound like *hnnnNNNNN* comes out of his throat. His hands clench into fists. I'm seeing all this from the corner of my eye. Is he going to scream? Throw something? Leave?

He takes a breath. Re-enters the number. Transaction goes forward. I breathe a sigh of relief.

Then I glance up. And the Staples checkout girl is *looking* at me. And in that glance was every single girl-what-is-you-*doing* I should have been getting from the friends he'd gradually isolated me from. I dropped my eyes, I couldn't hold that gaze. It actually hurt. I left him about a month later.

Will it take the pity in the eyes of a stranger to get you to say ""Fuck this shit, I'm out""? Because if so, here's me looking at you, girl."
you dont seem to have a relationship at all if he chooses to spend time with his friends over you constantly 
I’m SO happy that you talked to someone. I’m so proud of you for being incredibly smart about this situation. I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with it at all. 
Reading this made me feel a lot better about just telling a guy I didn't want to go on any more dates with him... I felt so bad about hurting his feelings... and he was great! So sweet and nice and smart and successful. But just no chemistry. Both people deserve better than that.
"If you think about it, though, the outside world is getting the ""brave face"" him and you *are* getting the real him. He's hurting a lot more than he's letting anyone else see. 

You two need joint therapy and he needs solo as well. I feel for you both."
"A simple ""Sorry, it's just not for me"" is much better than coming up with white lies and excuses. Your gf is uncomfortable with it, which is fair, so it's your responsibility to stop dragging your friend along like you're going to attend. "
"Definitely don't tell him why you're moving out while you're still stuck in a space with him. Just say something neutral, like you want to live alone, or a room with a friend opened up, or something else like that. Have a bunch of friends over helping you (the more the better). Hopefully you can get all your stuff moved out while he's in class.

Fingers crossed that he leaves you alone after this. Just reading your description of the situation made me profoundly uncomfortable. Maybe don't tell him which apartment you're moving to either. "
"That's so ballsy with an 8 year old, though. I mean, if he was meeting up with her, WITH their daughter, what was he telling her to keep her quiet? It is beyond fucked up if he was actually doing this. "
"You keep referring to him as your partner but I don't see the partnership here.

What exactly has he done to make you believe he has your back and wants to fully share your life like a partner?

It hasn't occurred to him to share his good fortune with you when he has a choice of reasons to do so.

He could foot more of the travel costs because he loves you, wants your company, wants to achieve this dream with you, or simply to thank you for giving him access to the investment. 

He could wait the year before travelling for the above mentioned reasons.

He could also have held off quitting his job.

He could start a new project or career while you save up the amount you need.

In short he has many reasons to accommodate your needs and your situation. He has multiple means to *achieve this dream as a team*.

Ask yourself why he has not chosen any of the above? Are his actions those of a partner?

He can also see how physically, mentally and emotionally taxing your current arrangement is but his vacation takes priority.

He has also made it clear that he will go travelling with or without you, as soon as he can.

He is basically ready to pull the plug on the relationship, or at least nuke it for a bit of travel. That's how little the relationship means to him. This is not a man invested in growing old together. To me that says you're expandable to him.

Think long and hard about the nature of your partnership and it's forecasted longevity before you leave your job to go travelling with him.

Heaven forbid you break your leg while you're in a rural setting of some developing country and ruin his travels. Are you sure he would fly back home with you to look after you?"
One word: cash. Have her use the envelope system. When the cash is gone that's it. You are the only one with the cards. Freeze her credit so she can't get new credit cards. They give you a pin when you do this - don't let her have access to the pin so she can't unfreeze it behind your back. In the end it's tough love but she's harming your kids. That's unacceptable. 
"Next time you stop in and she walks by, introduce yourself. I would not be surprised if he gets mad at you."
"Yes, tell your boyfriend. 

No, it's not wrong to ghost, if that's what you would like to do. His behaviour was awful and he did not stop. He knows why you left early, what he did wrong, and why you're upset. I wouldn't want to talk to someone who did that to me, either. "
"Are you talking to her about things you’d typically only talk to your wife about? Are you ignoring your wife for her (texting her during dinner, etc)? Are you complaining her to about your relationship? Those things lead towards emotional affair. From what you’ve described, you have a female friend, which is completely okay. 

Is your wife controlling about other aspects of your lives? Does she get upset when you go out with friends, etc?"

"I don't know that anything has to be done here.  Your boyfriend doesn't seem super engaged with this friend and if you trust that he would tell you if things start changing or something you could just let it go.

You might just ask him if he really gets much out of this friendship, though.  I mean, if I were him, the constant messaging would be really annoying and needy and I would want there to be a lot less of it.  If that turns out to be the case, he should try being less responsive or something.

I would ask him to silence his phone / turn off notifications if her constant messages are constantly interrupting your time with him, though."
"Former horse girl here, she's trying to manipulate you into saving herself money. Does she not board at a stable? They have staff you can pay to muck stalls.

"&gt;My question is, is this something I should let go

NO

&gt;is this something I should be concerned about?

YES

Let me ask you this. What are your standards for how you expect to be treated in a relationship; what will you or won't you accept? Like for me personally, I will not tolerate being called curse words, period. So no need to analyze if dude was half-asleep or what his deal was, because I refuse to accept being called that. I also do not accept physical abuse, or any threatening physical behavior such as you described. So again, no need to analyze what he did or wonder why he did it, that doesn't matter to me because I won't accept it.

You have to decide for yourself if you will accept this treatment from him. Only 4 months in and he's showing out. I can tell you this, if you stay, you will remember this incident and kick yourself for not leaving when it was 'just' him calling you a b!tch and pinning you to the bed to scream in your face, 'just' him throwing ish across the room and playing fast and loose with electricity and water. People like this *always* escalate."
He was annoyed cause you didn’t want to blow him while you had the flu and strep? And he somehow didn’t notice that you were super sick to the point that you had to explain that to him? Girl I hope there are redeeming qualities about him.

"&gt; They go out drinking alone occasionally after work, and Ive expressed my general discomfort with how behaves around her outside of work (e.g. getting drunk alone at bars, talking on the phone late at night, pretending to be her boyfriend so men dont hit on her) and he blows it off that I'm just jealous, and nothing is going on.

Translation:  ""He doesn't give a shit about me.""

As a dude who has dated overly and unnecessarily jealous girls before... *you're not just being jealous*.  You got alarm bells going off because **shit is on fire**.  You hear what I'm saying?  We're past a little smoke in the kitchen.  It's time to get the fire extinguisher out, and it may even be too late for that.

Even if -- and that's a big fuckin if -- there is nothing going on between them, the mere fact that he thinks this is ok (even when you said it wasn't!) is a major, major red flag.  Time to evacuate before YOU get burned."
"First off, my condolences on your loss.

&gt; she currently lives at my place so I can't tell her to leave me alone or go away. 

Just because you live together doesn't mean you are joined at the hip.  You are allowed to have alone time to process all of this.  She needs to realize that you are grieving, even if you aren't showing it by sobbing into a pillow.  She might be trying to distract you from this to keep you from being sad, but everyone grieves differently and she needs to allow you to grieve in the way you need to, even if that means her leaving you alone for a while.  That doesn't mean she has to physically leave your house, but at least give you space.  Simply tell you that you need some time and space to yourself and that you need her to respect that.

"&gt;We do not live together because it gives him anxiety to share his space - and he needs a lot of space. We will have an intimate encounter and it will make him back off, and downplay it or pull away for weeks at a time.

That right here would be a dealbreaker for most people. How can you imagine a future with someone like that ? 

Also in a relationship we always have to make compromises. I do things for my gf and she does things for me. Whats the point of being in a relationship if you can't support your SO ?

This guy is a spitting image of a guy I had to deal with in the army. Do NOT ever introduce him to any female friends. He's going to crash and burn and it will not be pretty for you to be around it - for a female friend it could be downright dangerous.

In all seriousness, sorry your BF is lame. You're way cooler than that BS. "
"&gt; Finally, my mom said that our daughter would not be proud of my wife and I, and how we are choosing to address my parents.

I've read this sub for years and this may be the most awful manipulative thing I've EVER seen. "
She sounds like a sweetheart. This kind of thing can happen to people who are quite shy and don’t have luck with friends early on. They learn to do without. I’d say keep enjoying your relationship and maybe invite her to a few gentle social events if she’s comfortable with it. Maybe she’ll find it easier socializing with you than she does by herself.

"Wow. So your friend wrote you this lovely letter, offered to pay for a dress she isn’t going to wear, and still wants to attend your other wedding activities.  You lied to her face about the venue thinking she’d change her mind, think that she’s just being overly-sensitive about something that many many people agree with her on, and think that you have a better understanding than she does about how her colleagues would view this?  You don’t deserve her friendship.  "
"I....think you're right. It's just a hunch but I think it's a break up. 

And you should ask her directly. 


"
That kind of badgering and whining is such a turn off. If my husband did that to me all he'd hear in return is the sound of all my orifices snapping shut like cheap change purses. Doesn't he remember from when he was a child that whining gets you nothing?
She wiped her computer? Yeah I'd say she's cheating in some capacity. I'm sorry. That combined with her sudden change in behavior is pretty damning.

"Your boyfriend sounds a little /r/iamverysmart. Your brain doesn't flick a switch at 24 and can suddenly comprehend the weight of emotions, emotional intelligence is something that develops over time. It doesn't sound like this isn't him knowing that he wants to be with you, but that he's somehow got it in his head that he's physically incapable of feeling ""love"" and therefore his feelings can't be love. It all sounds a bit silly, and that he's caught up in his own iamverysmart mental gymnastics.

&gt;He also said he’s afraid of “wasting my time” and that he doesn’t want me to be “giving 100%” while he can “only get to 50%.

If anything is concerning it's this. Saying he doesn't want to waste your time sounds like he knows you're not as high a priority to him as he is to you. Maybe this is his way of keeping an arms length on commitment in case he suddenly realizes that he is capable of love and the first person he loves isn't you.

I don't know, all of this is a little weird. What it comes down to is that he's just not very emotionally mature. He's not in tune with his own emotions, and is almost refusing to do some self-discovery because of ""biology"".

In your shoes, I'd be worried that you won't have a chair when he finally gets a grip and the music stops."
"&gt;They want to hang out with us! Initially though they did blame me for my brother burning down the house.

This is deeply disturbing.

You are far too excited about the opportunity to hang out with the people who blame you for everything."

"First off, that weight at your height is a very healthy place.  My ex-wife is exactly your size, she wore tags from size 0 to 6 and they all fit her perfectly. Size tags are utterly arbitrary. 

I raced bicycles for years and had my body fat at about 5%. However I couldn’t stay healthy. I was constantly fighting minor colds, not sleeping well and lethargic despite being in excellent condition.  I added a few pounds and all the health issues disappeared.  We have a minimum and it’s best to heed that boundary. 

His need for you to wear a size 0 is really about him somehow.   Please pay attention here, this is how people develop eating disorders and that will steal joy from you forever.  You will pay a psychological price if you give his odd demands any traction.  "

"Contact your advisor and let them know all that has gone down and that you would like them placed elsewhere. If you have any photo evidence, repair orders, etc, attach copies of all these things in an email to this said advisor. You said that you're leasing this place out. Does your landlord know of this arrangement?

"Sounds like you should go take your moms things that are important to you and go completely no contact with your father. 

He adds absolutely no value to your life and seems like a genuinely horrible person. This isn’t about the clothes. It’s about how he didn’t let you grieve and went on a date the day of his wife’s funeral. Disgusting. "
"Counseling. This does read as one-sided and it’s possible you’re working with a “good cop/bad cop dynamic” that you’re unaware of. 

Why is it you always staying home? What’s the work/life balance like? 

What efforts are you taking to ensure the “fun” parenting tasks are shared equally despite your kids’ preference? Their preference can count for something but shouldn’t dictate how parenting tasks or events are split. And, it’s also your job to support your wife. Not always but sometimes and none of those times are cited here likely because they’re few and far between. Maybe you don’t think there’s an issue with using the wrong towel, and maybe you think she should go through each step with them. And maybe she’s already made this request several times and it’s still not being followed. What’s so bad about saying “listen to your mother” sometimes? 

Basically it sounds like you have fully supported the separation of you and your wife into 2 camps, by doing nothing. This didn’t just happen. Kids don’t get to make all the decisions. Sometimes with favouritism it’s important to say “sweetie Dad’s busy right now but I know Mum would love to cuddle”. It just sounds like you don’t mitigate the events that have led to this dynamic, you word this like it just turned out that way because: You were the go-to guy for sick days, your girls have preferences and you don’t always agree with your wife’s parenting style. *Where is the part where you actively worked to not limit your relationship with your kids, but actually tried to consistently include Mum?*

Counseling. She’s being irrational but I have a feeling she’s now reacting to the small stuff because it’s been stored up for a long time. 

My toddler currently prefers his dad to me. It hurts. I had to ask my husband, “please make sure you “talk me up”. Make sure you sometimes let me do the goodnight cuddle even though he requests you.” And that’s made such a difference. "
Getting lunch with a friend ONCE A YEAR isn't even remotely enough reason to be this jealous.  Your GF has way too much insecurity to be in a relationship right now.
"Professional violinist here - it doesn't matter. She needs to cut that shit out ASAP. It is inconsiderate, and frankly, something she should have learned not to do 4ish years ago at the very latest.

Honestly they are likely passively aggressively and not-so-subtly hinting that they want a roommate that fits their lifestyle more. They want a bff and roomie that they are close friends with. This living situation may not work out. 
Why not have Jon tell this guy directly that its 21 plus?

"I'm trans too and sorry, hormones aren't an excuse. Sounds like she's an awful, emotionally abusive ""friend"" who you should cut contact with. 

Maybe it will teach her there are consequences to her actions and she'll treat people better in the future.

"&gt; And I almost felt like saying that you should have thought about that before you ran your mouth.

Maybe you should have.  Right now, your parents think that they're justified in what they're doing and that they have your support (and therefore probably have the support of other people).  Sometimes people need a reality check.

Then again, they may turn their ridiculousness on you.  Only you know them well enough to know what the likely path is."

Both guests and roommates often buy food and share food.  Both guests and roommates invite people over- usually with some consultation.

"I don't have any advice or anything, but I wanted to say that you sound like the most incredible sister I've ever heard of. Good luck with your sisters, hopefully they'll both work though their issues and remember for the rest of their lives how absolutely amazing their older sister is."
"I work from home, almost every day, and I can tell you that this is not an uncommon challenge; people tend to think that ""working from home"" equates to ""getting paid to hang out at home with nothing to do"", when often those of us who work from home have more to do and even less of a work/off-time boundary because if we're available to work from home, we have the facilities to work at essentially *any* time.

Have you laid it out in plain words for him?  Something like:

""[Boyfriend], when you want to get together with me while I am working, it makes me feel as if you do not understand that, even though I can work from anywhere, I am on the clock, and am therefore responsible to be *working* and productive, just like if I were in the office.  I need you to understand that, during my work hours, I am not available, any more than I would be if I were in an actual office.""

If you haven't, you can try that. But there's no guarantee that he'll listen."
"I'm sorry, OP, but they're just buttering you up in hopes of getting something from you, i.e., moving in with you or even guilting you into paying his legal fees. If you say yes, you'll be letting your brother move in with you after prison.

You were heading towards a good place with setting boundaries. Don't let this situation derail that progress. Keep your parents at arm's length and think about therapy to help you deal with the situation."
"&gt;Why was your SIL silent during this whole affair?

To be fair to SIL, OP cut off her friendship with Beth over Beth saying nasty things about SIL, Miss Fruit Loops showed up at SIL's birthday party unexpectedly and very likely uninvited, and then mom then immediately put SIL on the spot by turning to her directly and going, ""Oh, you don't mind her being here, *do you*?""

Poor SIL was probably thinking ""Jesus God please let the earth open up and swallow me whole right now."" I agree 100% with the whole makeup-dinner idea."

"&gt;Finally, my mom said that our daughter would not be proud of my wife and I, and how we are choosing to address my parents. 

You are underreacting to this. Your mother said this purposely to hurt and shame you. This is completely unacceptable. Your parents should be ashamed of themselves using a dead child to get what they want. They should be ashamed for purposely trying to hurt you.

You may not be ready to cut them out permanately but you should definitely cut them out until they apologize and acknowledge what they did was incredibly wrong. "
"We all have our own coping mechanisms generally, getting away to unplug from the world is great for your mental health.

Good luck and don't let anybody tell you that you can't get away because it's the best thing that you can do."
"If I were a parent who is generously buying a car for my kids, I would be pretty offended that said kid didn't think it was good enough. BUT I would t punish the other child. The one who wasn't happy with a used car would not be driving said used car.

"Your roommate needs therapy.  If she is going to be ""triggered"" by almost 50% of the human population, that's a big problem and will end up effecting your personal life inside and outside of your home sooner or later.

He can still be a father without being a husband. 
"“Telling what to wear sounds too obviously abusive so instead, I’ll consistently tear you down while offering no actual insight.” 

He’s not kind. He’s not loving. This is a problem. He either finds a way to help, or stops the comments, or simply decides what he needs in a relationship. This is not acceptable and it is rapidly approaching abuse. "
"Today was only your first soccer practice, it's a new environment and you are not yet used to the idea that men can raise their voices for positive reasons (encouragement, guidance, etc). You might know it rationally, but subconsciously your brain hasn't caught on to that yet because it's so far removed from your previous experience.

So you may find that after a few more sessions at soccer, and just general life experience, you will be able to adjust to this new situation. Things like focussing on your breathing can help in the moment, but exposure will help in the long term.

If over time you find your anxiety about men shouting doesn't lessen, then you will need therapy or counselling to help you cope. Ask your mum to take you to the doctor, and if she unreceptive then ask at your school. You can also Google to find a hotline for teens with mental health issues in your area.

At yout next session you may also want to talk to your soccer coach about what's going on. He may be able to adjust his coaching style somewhat, or at least recognise when/why you're having troubles.

This is not a shameful or embarrassing thing that you need to keep secret and hide from people. You are exhibiting a perfectly normal response to the stressful and abusive environment you grew up in, it's not your fault. When you tell trusted adults around you about it then they can better accommodate your needs and help you recover."
"Whatever you do , don’t give him his job back. Your other employees won’t respect you and if it hasn’t happened already the resentment from his special treatment will explode. Business comes first if you want to succeed.

Now with your brother, I think it’s time to put the ball in his court. I don’t know if he’s been caudelled his whole life or always given things he never had to work for. But you chasing after him isn’t going to do any good. He needs to learn that if he wants a relationship with his brother he needs to put effort in and RESPECT you and he’s just not there yet. I think he needs time alone with out you around to realize what he’s missing. He’s pretty selfish and doesn’t take anyone else into consideration clearly. If he comes crying back for his job say NO. He’s put the strain on the relationship not you, he can fix it when he’s ready to grow up and apologize. Don’t enable his behaviour and act like what he did was okay to keep the peace. He needs a big wake up call. Who cares if he says you fired him, you should have a long time ago. No point in arguing , he knows the truth he’s just being a manipulative baby. Let him be for now . Good luck! "

"Lawyer here. Adding to this - OP needs to organize her finances ASAP, and ideally before she walks into the first lawyer's office.

\- Get screenshots and account numbers for every financial account she knows about - checking, credit, debt, and retirement. Better yet, download the account histories in PDF and/or .csv format.

\- Make copies of your most recent tax returns.

\- If either of you had significant assets before the marriage (e.g. cars or retirement plans), or inherited money or property during the marriage, draw up a list of that.

\- Make a list of your monthly bills. How much does it cost to keep the lights on, the fridge full, and the kids in their programs?

Sooner or later, OP is going to have to do this homework. OP will save herself a lot of time, grief, and expense if she does it quietly and privately now, rather than wait until it comes up in discovery."
"Wow. This is the kind of action people take when they go *off* their meds. If he hadn't ghosted you, I'd almost wonder if someone else (jealous gf?) had sent the message ""for"" him.

Even if something in the friendship was making him unhappy, this isn't how you bring it up. It's not your wife's fault that she didn't telepathically know he was unhappy. I get the feeling that this has more to do with the new meds than an actual history of suppressed upset.

Regardless of what he thinks, that friendship is probably over. Unless your wife is able to forget and forgive that he just dropped this blame bomb and left you guys in the dark. Not sure I could without some profuse apologies and one hell of an explanation.

With a loss like this, just being there for her will probably help a lot. Offering to take over more than your share of childcare for a while, if it's doable, might be a gesture that'd give her breathing room to organize her thoughts and feelings too."

She has violated your boundaries time and again and has shown that she doesn't care about you or what you want (or, more accurately in this case, what you don't want). Forcibly kissing you is assault. Report her. This kind of behavior can escalate and a written record will help. Regardless of how it impacts her life, that's not your fault. Those are the consequences for her actions and you and your girlfriend deserve to be safe. "

Nobody wants to live with the partner's mother. There will be no privacy or intimacy and your wife will be a third wheel. She will not be the matriarch in her own home. Don't push this with your wife.
I feel even more bad for your wife after reading your last post. This woman has put so much effort into you and you have the nerve to call the other woman who is openly trying to break up your marriage and sleep with you your best friend.  Your wife deserves better. 
"At first I was going to go along the lines of what some people were telling you: dreams can make no sense. Even the fact that it was about a guy who you have been uncomfortable with could have just been a coincidence. Our brains do strange things. 

But..

After reading your comments, I would be very concerned. She talks to him frequently, and when you asked her to tone it back a little, she did, but only for a short time before resuming the previous frequency. And the most concerning: she is specifically going to hang out over at their house while you are always stuck watching your daughter at home. The fact that she waits till the last minute to tell you, giving you basically no warning, is bullshit. And just because his wife is there doesn’t mean something couldn’t be going on. 

At the very least, even if nothing inappropriate is going on between your wife and her friend (and the friend’s wife), what she’s doing - waiting till the last minute to tell you, leaving you to watch your daughter and going by herself- is incredibly disrespectful, and most likely deliberate. 

You need to have a serious talk with your wife and point this all out. How long has she been going over there without you before you met them at the birthday party? More importantly, why can’t they come over to your place sometimes?"
"If you want to see those kids you need to stop it with the ""we"" and ""our"". 

Your brother is the only one that can force a relationship with them, and he is not going to do that. If you side with your parents you will never see those kids again, since it sounds like they are on the harrassment train to legal action. 

Form your own relationship with your SIL and NEVER talk about or take your parents side. 

You parents are being unreasonable assholes. You do not want to side with them on this. "
"Not your fault. Why didn't your parents take her in after they bailed her out? They just kicked her to the curb and expected you to pick her up out of the gutter? Nah. It sucks that this happened and that they're blaming you, but I wouldn't say this was your fault at all."
"It sounds like your boyfriend is mostly managing it by just responding platonically when he has available time. If anything, I would be worried for this girl. It sounds like maybe he's the only person she has to be social with and thats gotta be a huge bummer for her. I would just leave it. 

""Its okay, I trust you to be appropriate with her. If she starts getting flirty or something changes though, I do expect you to let me know even if you are handling it. But for now, its really just your phone going off all the time when were together thats bothersome. Would you mind muting your FB messenger notifications when we're spending quality time together?"" 

Edit: She wouldn't be able to see her conversations have been muted. And its not like he doesnt know she's messaging. He can always check later when he has time and reply back, just as he has been. It shouldnt really make any functional change other than now there wont be a bunch of pinging from his phone while you are trying to have a quiet, private time with one another. "
"Yeah, for a lot of these sorts of things, the alternative isn't 'five people on a more expensive plan', it's 'lose five customers'. Trust that these companies will look out for themselves and *stop offering the plan* if it becomes cost ineffective. They are *not* doing any of this as a *favor*."

He wasn't really asking for an open relationship.  Open relationships are agreed upon before one of the partners starts pursuing others.  He just wanted to cheat and not be labelled a cheater.
"Whatever you do, don't agree to have a kid to try to save the marriage / make husband happy. Kids are a massive strain on even a great marriage. Your marriage is currently marked by drinking, crying, fighting, failure to communicate, no sex, and wholly mismatched expectations.

If he wants kids and you don't; if you want to go see Australia or Kenya or Bali someday, and he doesn't even see the point of visiting Orlando; if the only time you feel you can blurt out a little truth to him is when you're hammered... I am not sure why you guys are married at all. A professional therapist can give you a definitive answer.

Perhaps you can find the common ground that does not seem evident right now."

"As a society we really fetishize forgiveness, but not everything can be forgiven. You may not have been the nice person in that scenario, but you definitely weren't the bad person."
"It’d be one thing if he’d asked that prior to cheating on you, but the only reason he asked was *because* he cheated - like an open relationship will somehow slight that hurt or erase his mistakes. I think he’s a douche, and you could find better. Even if an open relationship was something you’d be interested in, it’s only worth it if you trust the person and they respect you enough to ask for your approval to do these things. To me, this isn’t worth it. Just seems like a bullshit way for him to not feel guilty about being a cheater."

I would be uncomfortable with it too. Porn is one thing but to me using a cam girl's services is interacting one on one with another person in a sexual context outside of the relationship. I don't know if I'd consider it cheating but I get why you feel that way. I think you should communicate this to him the way you did in your post.
"I think some good tips have already been given. Something I would like to add concerning concrete conversation situations:

 I used to be very shy, too.  I always felt much more comfortable when my conversation partners talked a lot about themselves and I didn't have to reveal so much about myself. I know you want to get to know her, but maybe it helps to start by taking her out of focus and talking more about you or general topics. 

Questions like ""Did you have a good sleep last night?"" were very difficult for me, as I never knew exactly what to answer.  Small talk in general was very difficult for me, no matter how nice the conversation partners were. Conversations with a concrete goal or topic, e.g. planning an activity or playing a board game, were much easier for me. 

Your family already makes a very warm, open impression. Ultimately, social anxiety is a problem inside her head. No matter how hard you try, in the end only she can get the problem under control herself. "
"&gt; How do I convince her that she’s being ridiculous 

That’s the problem. She’s not. She has beliefs and convictions that you don’t need to agree with to be valid. 

She told you before the venue was planned that she wouldn’t be part of it if it was at a plantation. It’s at a plantation, so she’s not going to be a part of it. What’s ridiculous about that?

She was very courteous and offered to give her dress to whoever replaces her for free. 

She’s not the one being a bad friend here. The bride that’s expecting her friend to abandon her personal beliefs is. "
"College prof here who was also first generation to go to college. I see this all the time. The rest of the family is convinced that the ""college girl"" is doing it to make them feel bad or lower than she is. Rather than elevate themselves to your level, they are trying to pull you down to theirs. By you going to college, you are blowing away their excuse for not going since you are able to do it. They are likely also to think that you feel that you are better than them.

&amp;#x200B;

My encouragement to you is to find other first gens at your school and bond with them. You are all going through the same thing and can be a great source of support for each other.  Lots of universities also have support groups for other first gens. And, to your family, continue to reassure them (by actions not by words which could backfire) that you don't feel like you are better than them and that you are doing this for yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please PM me if you want to talk more. I became a college prof to help other first gens make the transition and I am happy to be a source of support and encouragement to you."
"The reason the venue is so “beautiful” is because it was built using wealth created by enslaving humans. Selling their children. Whipping them. Denying their humanity. It’s not a coincidence that the opulence and grandeur of the location happens to adjoin such atrocities—they are deeply and directly connected. 

Staging an upscale ceremony and reception inside such a venue signals, in no small way, the desire to re-embody the affluence and luxury of its former owners. Think about what it means that you feel connected to that aspect, instead of the misery and oppression that led to its “beauty.”"
"&gt;She also recently got a second phone.

Why?"
"Would it help if he heard it from someone else? It is just not normal to run a car into the ground in three years. Try having it appraised and ask them to estimate how much it would have been worth without all the damages - just normal wear and tear. Maybe seeing it like that will help. 

I guess basically you’re going to have to be blunt about it. He’s not just hard on cars, he destroys them. Point out that it will be prohibitively expensive to make repairs on your car, and it will destroy your joy in it. 

I don’t really have any good advice, but I definitely don’t think you’re overreacting!"
"Wow, he sounds like a fucking *mess*. It's unfortunate that he is trying to drag you down with him into this shitty little hole he's built for himself."
"&gt; I thought she was being overly sensitive

This is the problem. 

You do not get to decide how people feel about this sort of thing, especially right now when America is going through yet another period of major racial upheaval and we are confronting the darkest parts of our history through an even darker lens. 

And you sure as shit don't get to decide how black people feel about their own history and where and when they choose to express those feelings. That's incredibly condescending and just proves her point."
"Better question: how does *your girlfriend* deal with this guy?

"I used to work for a store that sold membership cards that provided the owner with a 10% discount plus coupons. We *knew* the memberships were being shared, we literally watched people hand the card off to their friend behind them in the line and 0 fucks were given from the store manager down to the janitorial staff. We were just happy that people signed up for them and bought stuff in the first place and HQ never banned the practice, they never even mentioned it. It was one of our lowkey selling points when we tried to sell a new one.

Imo if any of these companies cared, they'd set up tighter restrictions."
So does this mean he drove around with his car decals expired too or....?
"Your first car SHOULD be a pre-owned. 

So you can learn on it and not care so much about all the dings and scratches along the way. Once you guys get the hang of it, later down the road you’d take better care of a new car. 

Honestly, I know it’s not your fault, but I don’t blame your parents if they don’t buy you guys a car. You’re brother sounds extremely spoiled and ungrateful. If he wants a new car so bad he should get a job and help with the payments. "

Please be honest with me and explain why you keep wiping your computer. If you're planning a surprise party for me, I would rather just have the piece of mind that nothing else is going on. 

If she is still angry and unwilling to talk, she is, at the very least, a jerk, and, at worst, a cheater. Good luck. "
"&gt; He even sent her pictures of him with our daughter and saying ""your babies miss you"", and even just videos and pictures of our daughter.

"Still man, the question stands.  Do you want to be with someone who you have to convince to look beyond your skin color?  It doesn't matter if this is a deeply held private belief, pressure from family, or a compelling argument made to her by a little green man only she can see.  It's a deeply humiliating situation to be in for you.  How much dignity are you willing to sell to keep dating this girl for a little longer?"
"&gt;I turned around and said that I would find my friends then come back to them. I found my friends, told them I was going back to my fiancé and his friends to see what we wanted to do, but when I got back outside, my fiancé and his friends were gone.

Hell yeah! Go you!! You are awesome. 
"I think the first step is going to be figuring out how you can provide for yourself, so that when you do tell them you're done with this, they don't have anything they can hold over your head. 

Whether that means having a worst-case fall back plan or actually being prepared to move out is up to you, because it's clear this is seriously affecting your life at this point. 

When you're at a point where you can say ""if you're going to kick me out over this then so be it"" then I would just be honest. You're an adult, if they're worried about you, you will do what you can to assure them you're okay. But you're 24 and will not be constantly monitored like a child. You can and will stay the night with your boyfriend. Whether that means evil sex is happening is none of their business so don't even entertain that for a second. 

Basically you need to lay down clear boundaries while being able to deal with the potential fallout. "

"#**DO NOT FIX THIS**

It is boundary setting time. Your SIL needs to own up for her responsibility in this situation. She needs to apologize for slapping you and blaming you for all of this.

Ultimately, your brother should be the one to get this done. Why? Because without a spine and without setting healthy boundaries with his wife, he will be trapped in an unhappy marriage, his wife will end up resenting him, he will wonder why nothing he does is good enough, and it will all likely collapse in divorce within 7 years.

You should keep on trying to see your niece. You should keep on seeing your brother. You should keep your SIL in check everytime she acts out."
"Nope. That's stalkery, dishonest, creepy, intrusive, and controlling.

This goes beyond  just using it to engineer 'coincidental' meetings - I bet he's also using it to keep tabs on your activity: to see if  you are overnighting at some other guy's place etc. -  He's already crazy jealous.

I'd also **check your computer for a keylogge**r. That's probably how he seems to have he just checked off so many boxes with you: he tracks your activity and fakes an interest/fakes behaviour that he knows you'll like.

This guy is seriously bad news. Do tell people."
You or your mother can explain the situation to the funeral home director. You are certainly not the first family that has wanted/needed to keep someone out of the main service. They can organize a private viewing for your father as well.
"Then listen to your gut. He is being a scumbag and leading you on. He said you’d be proud of how good he was on his trip, because he was better behaved than his friends. He only kissed a girl. His friends probably slept with other girls. Then he asked you for free-reign to sleep around the next time he travels. Screw that. He can be single and sleep around. I would also advise you, that if you feel like it, to let his friends’ girlfriends know what your ex said they were getting up to on their little boys holiday. "

&amp;#x200B;

Ditch the immature jackass and be glad he showed you who he really is before he could do any real damage to your life."
"He sounds terrible.

It sounds like he is a very dutiful person and has a strong work ethic.

It sounds like he treats marriage more like a job than an emotional attachment to another.

He also sounds totally emotionally closed off.

I (31m) cannot imagine how lonely my wife would feel if I was just that withdrawn and distance.  I don't see how you can even be happy in such a situation.

Being scared of your SO is always a terrible thing.

Bringing children into the equation sounds like a sure fire way to raise some emotionally broken children, with a father like that.

If he gets that physical with you when he is angry I just would imagine him beating the shit out of a kid for not obeying him instantly."
"You boyfriend is allowed to want sex.  He is NOT allowed to hold your relationship hostage and make it a cold, chilly, miserable place because he's not currently getting banged.  He is acting immature, juvenile, and childish about it.  I've never wanted to have sex with someone who is moping about not having sex - have you?  I would recommend you tell him that the way he shows his displeasure is really unattractive and that he maybe bring up a conversation with you if he feels his needs aren't being met, instead of acting like a petulant child."
"EXACTLY! This would be such a party-foul in our marriage! The rule is :

MIL: Can we have $?
DH: We will talk it over and get back to you. 

Later...

DH: We've decided we can't afford it. Sorry. 

And what's up with grown -ass adults taking money from their kids? And moving is expensive! They'll be hitting you up for cash all the time of they move, because they moved all that way to be close to you. 

Honestly, I think you (both) should reopen the conversation with her, and this time don't tell her you are ""absolutely fine with it."" You guys need to get your boundaries straight and working well before taking that step. 

And tell her it has nothing to do with being family... I wouldn't give money to someone in my own family either!"

"Personally, I think it would be a massive mistake to continue this relationship.  She's conning you, making you feel badly about yourself as part of the con, and overall is not trustworthy.

"Yeah that bit raised my eyebrows.

You do not need to be friends with all your friend's friends. That would be quite a task. Let them have their time together and you can have your time together. It doesn't have to be intertwined. 
"&gt; what kind of husband accepts this behaviour and allows people in his life who are this cruel to his wife? Answer: A shitty husband.

Get enough people and get your ducks in a row and you could probably move out very quickly.  Maybe not even have to deal with him face to face at all.
"Make sure he is ringing you up as purchase whipped cream, strawberries, peaches, a banana, a copy of GQ, condoms, disinfectant wipes, and, finally, the biggest eggplant they sell.  Maintain total and unflinching eye contact with him through the interaction, even if he averts his gaze.  Keep your hand on the eggplant as he attempts to move it onto the scale with the aim of impressing him with your strong grip.  When he asks 'paper or plastic', flirtfully inform him that you treat bags like you treat underwear - as utterly unnecessary.  Gather all the items up in your arms (don't drop the peaches) and march out, pausing only briefly by the automatic  doors to dramatically cast a look over your shoulder at him.

And that's how you do seduction, baby 😎"

He did a horrible thing. He cheated and denied it. He rationalized it. He planned a physical affair while having an emotional one.

I'd strongly advise you to stick with your original breakup, but if you really want to give it a shot the bare minimum that needs to happen is calling off the wedding. "

"Buddy, I hate to say it, but move on.  If she wants to pass you up based on the color of your skin, that's on her.  You have alot to offer and you should find somebody who doesn't base whether or not to stay with you on the fact that you are black.  She sounds like she also held off on it so she could get a little Florida vacation in.  Anyway, move on and find better.  I know you probably don't think there is better out there, but there is."

Why do you have  to move out of your home to accommodate his visiting parents?   It sounds like another aspect of his selfishly not considering your needs.   If you don't have a home to call your own, that's what you should be looking to correct right now.    

Even though you moved in together too soon, it hasn't taken long to appreciate your mistake.   So aim to be in a new place by yourself when his parents come and free yourself to find someone who will prioritize you and the relationship.    "

It's going to happen again. As a recovering alcoholic I can assure you I've made this promise thousands of times in my life. Sometimes I meant it, sometimes I was flat out lying.

"Wow, your brother sounds like an ass. My sympathies.

Rather than saying to your parents ""I'll appreciate any car you get me"" (which may still sound off to them given your brother's comments) I would focus on telling them some of what you said here. Make it clear that your brother's views were his alone, and you don't agree. Tell your mom that you know better than to think that salary determines her value in the family, and let her know that all the ways she ""keeps the family running"" aren't lost on you. You can even talk about appreciating the way that your parents are  choosing to raise you, and  make it clear that you don't have any regrets or jealousy with regard to the spoiled ""no consequences"" lifestyle your aunt and uncle provide to your cousin.

Once that's out of the way, I would let them know that you understand if the offer of a used car is off the table, and you'll be okay with whatever decision they make. And try your best to truly be okay with whatever outcome."

"Is it easier for you to believe his has a personality disorder (which can be treated) than to believe he’s just garden variety abusive?  With the former, you can pretend he’s the victim of something.  With the later you’d have to face up to him just choosing to be a bad person.

In either scenario, leaving is the right move.  Either he genuinely is ill and refused treatment or he’s abusive and refused to not be.  You’re not safe, happy or healthy either way."
"&gt; I feel like I will regret ending it. I don't know how to break up with him when I don't really *want* to, I just cognitively know I need to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think you might be surprised by how you feel after you break up with him. You will feel sad and bad about it, but at the same time I think you might find yourself feeling relieved. You've been living for a long time repressing your feelings, putting up a barrier to protect yourself from disappointment and living on false hope that it might get better. I really think it's going to feel good to let go of all of that and just be real. 

I think it will help if you get some therapy and look into why you settled for so little for yourself for such a long time. You've done an incredible amount of sacrifice here and put your own needs on the back burner with very little reward. I think you need to look into why you fell into that pattern, so that you can hopefully avoid it again in future. 

Please spend the next few months treating yourself better. "
"Usually when this question is asked on here, it's practically always yes. 

But it really doesn't sound like you guys are having an emotional affair at all. I think your wife is being insecure and controlling."
"&gt;He said that it wasn't a good way to deal with stress, I should be talking to people, and not isolating myself. 

This is very short-sighted. He needs to respect that not everyone has the same coping mechanisms as he does (or even as the majority of people he knows does). He doesn't need to understand it, but just respect it. "

It sounds like she may be jealous of your younger sister. Chloe is a young, pretty cis girl with a boyfriend -- Ashley likely wants to be in her shoes and is lashing out. it's not healthy and she needs to stopping bulling Chloe.

For now, show concern for both but have Chloe come live with you if you can. She is a minor and her health is unstable (Anorexia is no joke! She is damaging her internal organs and could die from it!)."

"&gt;Recently, when we've met new people or talked about what we do with acquaintances, and people are more interested in the stuff I do, he gets irritable. At first I didn't notice the connection, but recently I've seen that every time it happens he gets bored of the conversation and wants us to leave. And gets snippy with me over little stuff.

&gt;I asked him why he was annoyed one day it happened, and he denied it at first, but eventually said that ""bragging isn't a good look on you"" and ""you act like it's more interesting than it actually is. Like you spent all day peer reviewing documents""

&gt;I said I wasn't bragging, I was just talking about something I thought was cool, and he accused me of being defensive.


Boyfriend, husband, mother, uncle, friend, boss, whoever: anyone in your life who isn't happy for you when you succeed is not someone who should be in your life. Anyone who makes your success and your positives into a negative issue about themselves is toxic.

I'm not saying ""dump him!"" right away, but set a hard boundary: you deserve support and encouragement from your partner. If he can't give you that because of his own jealousy issues then that should tell you all you need to know about your future with this man, which is to say that there is none.

Be with a partner who **brags to other people about you,** not one who accuses you of bragging for simply describing your life and your job."
"NP here; I have a bachelors degree in nursing with an additional 2 year master degree (6 total years of schooling)...my NP program required 500  hours of clinical time in addition to my undergrad clinical hours. Now, if I chose to go to medical school, this would be another separate 4 years of JUST school, plus a 3-4 year residency afterwards, and potentially a 2+ year fellowship...and in no way would medical school coincide with nurse practitioner school...they are taught under completely different philosophies and models of care. Only other question, did she complete school in the US? I can’t speak for international schools, however. 

Also (and very important no matter where she went to school) - if I type my name into google with the name of my state “random name, NP California” (for an example) my license number, practicing facility, and identifying information pops up...you could certainly try this with her. If she’s the real deal, her info will definitely pop up.

Best advice, do not under any circumstance let your friend send her money and I’d honestly be cautious meeting her! The whole situation reeks of catfish...I’m so sorry that this is happening."
"Mmmmm...not really, no."
"You are married.
He did cocaine within the last year.
You didn't trust him to be at a party with exes alone.

There are 2 issues here, possibly 3.
1) Regardless of whether it's regular or not, he does coke. You need to decide how much of a deal this is to you.
2) You either trust him or you don't. Even if my partner did drugs (not his thing) at a party with his exes, it would never cross my mind that he might cheat.
3) I wouldn't stress about 5 hours of my partner being incommunicado when I know they're busy? He's at a party and you were going to bed... Relax.

It genuinely seems like you don't really trust him which (whether warranted or not) suggests you rushed into marriage so i'd definitely recommend talking it out and establishing what's acceptable in your relationship."
"You definitely need to be more assertive here. She doesn't 'need' you, she needs to learn to have some empathy and grow up!"
"He was fishing. Your husband was looking for any possible thing he could find to generate some anger, and that's the best he could do? Pathetic. One wonders if he's projecting, but theories are theories and idle speculation won't get you far. There's obviously something wrong, but a photograph of an ex and his wife sent eight months back is surely not it. Attacking you when you're emotionally vulnerable at this late stage, as well, he obviously decided he doesn't care."

What options do you think there are exactly for the kind of woman and wife who says shit like ""if [my] mom never worried about money [I] shouldn't have to either"" with a 10k credit card debt hanging over her head while siting around at home like a bum? I would really like to know that honestly. 


Sorry but you're in total denial. I don't think you want to admit what a mistake every step of the journey this has been. No therapy, ultimatum, or serious talk is going to suddenly make your lazy and leech of a wife start to care about you, your finances, and the state of your marriage. This is over. Find an attorney and try to leave with whatever dignity and small amount of money you have left before she sucks everything from you. The longer you stay the worse it will be for you. "
"This is one of those stories where you wish you could hear the partner's side of the story, because from your version of events she's simply hyper controlling and illogical...
Is she controlling in other aspects of your life? How is she as a partner otherwise? "
"Please do NOT “take one for the team.” Honestly, you would only end up resenting him.  Two kids are so so much harder than one. Can you take him to your counseling appointment with you? Maybe he would be more accepting if it came from the counselor or if you had their support in trying to talk to him about it."
"It's racist to date a black dude 'for fun' or 'for a short period of time' but not see yourself with them long term BECAUSE of their race. Also, succumbing to pressure from ""other places"" still makes her racist "
"Yeah you are right, I've tried being nice to him, but I think I really just need to cut him off and completely avoid him. I'll definitely try my best with the housing department but I'm not sure if anything can be done. I signed a one year lease, paid first and last months rent, plus there are no vacancies elsewhere in the complex. "
"He's telling you that kids are a very maybe. He already has one he doesn't enjoy to parent the few days he does see her. Why don't you believe him? 

You're getting to the age where magazines usually talk about ticking biological clocks. If you want a child most definitely, you find someone else. If you wait, what will happen if in 5 years your boyfriend still feels like he does today? Or 10 years? What if you give up on your dream and stay with him, will the relationship with a vague promise still fulfill? What if you are with him for years, don't have a kid and then break up? (Btw, fertility is personal, your eggs don't shrivel up and die when you're 37.)

Be with someone whose final goal is similar to yours. Then you have the same motivation to work towards it. "
"A detail I should have mentioned is that he is the reason that I am part of this organization. I guess I'll be a little more specific about the organization, so I can mention some more details. It's student government. 

I would have stood no chance of being elected if it weren't for him because no one at this school knows who I am, nor did I have prior experience in student gov't whereas he did. He kind of took me under his wing despite the fact that I had no experience whatsoever. That's where my guilt comes from. I did nothing to deserve getting elected (other than doing my best to serve after the fact).

Of course I take my job seriously and I love it, but because I'm new, I'm unsure that I am any more fit for the position than he is. Ultimately I know you're right. I guess I just have guilt and doubts in myself."
"Well, if that’s what you want, here you go:

The career trajectory of an MD stands thus:   

Medical school - 4-6 years, you must pass

Intern - 1-3 years, doing rotations between different specialties 

Resident - 1+ years, this is where you begin studying for your specialty.  You become a resident just by being a doctor long enough to no longer be an intern, there’s no exam as such.  You try to get accepted into a training scheme - called a ‘college’.   So, “college of adult internal medicine”, “college of general practice”, “college of surgery”, “college of neurology”, etc etc etc.  This college will train you in that specialty.

Registrar (min 3 years out of uni - more likely 4/5+) - this is a low-level ‘senior’ doctor.   This is where you are upon completion of your residency.   You don’t *have* to pass exams - it’s whenever your boss thinks you’re skilled enough to take on the responsibilities of a registrar.  *However*, there are exams that run concurrently to your working life, and they are often required as you get higher in rank within the registrar title.   

You have “part ones” and “part twos” as exams.   When exactly you need to sit them is not set in stone, and varies a lot depending on specialty and location and personal career trajectory.   Many people take, fail, and resit them several times before passing.   This happens within the time you are a registrar.   Some doctors never move above registrar in rank.

Consultant - when you pass your part twos, you are given the title ‘consultant’.   This is the ‘boss’ doctor, who supervises the more junior doctors and makes sure the patients are being cared for correctly.  They are experts in their field.   Most specialists you visit privately are consultants.  This is the peak of the doctor pyramid, the highest official rank you can be granted.   Newly minted consultants are ‘junior’ and those who have been around a few years are considered ‘senior’.  The more senior you are, the more you are considered an authority on your specific field.   

Doctors and nurses have very different jobs and very, *very* different training.   There is literally no way a nurse would be able to “complete her residency” as a doctor without an actual MD degree.   None.  Zero.   Not dissing nurses, just emphasizing that the skills and knowledge is *very very different* for nurses as for doctors.   She may have been able to ‘log’ some time worked as a nurse to put towards her acknowledged experience, but a resident has a very different job to even the most senior nurse.  

If this lady graduated from med school several months ago, she is an intern.   End of story.  It’s possible there have been some wires crossed in the retelling, so there is a slim chance that things are not as ludicrous as they seem, but to me it sounds like she is playing on your friend’s ignorance of the internal structure of medicine as a career.   

[A note about my career summary - this is based on my knowledge of medicine from my country, which is western but not the US.   The path will be *basically the same* anywhere in the west but there might be a minor difference or two in duration or timing. ]"
Be direct. Tell him you need to talk and in person let him know that you don't have romantic feelings for him. Do it as soon as possible so he doesn't keep telling others.
"Seems more in character of him to say something like ""It isn't my responsibility to do YOUR job hunting for you, you're just being lazy/entitled/generic complaint about young people""."
LOL I choked reading this. Thanks for the laugh!
"&gt;EDIT: Also his main reasoning was that I didn’t call him while he was on his first trip to Europe. But I did call - our phones were having issues connecting. So he said he was mad that I hadn’t reached out ( but I did ) 

When someone tries to blame you for their shitty behavior (i.e. I cheated because you didn't call me while I was on vacation) then take it as a sign of things to come.

Also, I have a feeling you aren't going to trust him in the future."
Exactly like when I’m trying to tune my bass and the drummer thinks that now is a perfect time to launch into a Buddy Rich transcription
"&gt; why is sex the only thing that stops you being ""basically roommates""?

This surprised me as well.  My wife had a baby last year.  We didnt have sex for a good while, as people are apt to do after birthing a kid.  But I stilled kissed my wife, grabbed her butt when she walked by, tickled her, got all big spoon on her in bed.  All things I would feel fairly uncomfortable doing with a roommate.  Lol"
"Tell her that her not working, and not evening looking for work (or picking up temp assignments to keep some money coming in) is an absolute deal-breaker for you.   
Time for some tough love. Do not give her any money for her outings with friends, and do not reduce the amount she pays for household expenses. Make it clear that she is not holding up her end of the financial relationship, and that you *will not* be supporting her while she *hangs out and tries to find herself.*  
"
"&gt; Friendship doesn't come easily to everyone

I actually thought this was becoming a more well-known phenomena. I mean, there was an entire movie (*I love you, Man*) dedicated to the fact it's not always easy to make friendships, especially good ones.

Regardless, I can empathize with Kate. I'm lucky that I have one good female friend but if I were to get married tomorrow I wouldn't have a best man."
"I had a friend who was being catfished. I basically told her my thoughts but was really supportive. I was like, “just be aware if he ever asks for money. If he asks for money he is certainly a catfish.” Dude claimed to be an engineer living in NYC. 

One day she claimed he was flying into town. I knew something was going to come up and it of course wasn’t going to happen. But I was like, “text me where you’re going to be and send a pizza emoji if shit gets weird and you need help.” Of course, he canceled but she appreciated my concern. 

Next the catfish claimed to fly  out of the country for work. Of course in the new country he claimed he had his wallet stolen and he finally asked for money. Which is when she dropped him. 

It was like a 3-4 month process.  Important thing is, send your friend information concerning catfishing behavior. I think it was a gov website. But otherwise try to be supportive because thats all you can do. 

She was really lonely and depressed and just wanted to be loved. It was pretty sad. 

Unfortunately she recently married a pedophile with like, 5 kids by 5 women and now she’s number 6. Soooo, yeah. Some people are just going to make shit choices and you can only do so much to protect them from themselves. 

"
Just a heads up that strip clubs in Vietnam are more brothel than strip club.
"&gt; his answer was ""Stop being a B@#$%"". I was like um, I meant like us making sure we get alone time, etc. and he was like ""no, you just need to stop being a B@#$%"". He then proceeded to tell me that if I said no to this that he was leaving to get an apartment with his father.

Wow. I'd be helping him pack up his stuff after that comment. "
"This.
My best friend now has four daughters because of this mindset. Growing up she didn't want any children, but ""took one for the team"" for their first. Then it snowballed into him wanting to keep trying until he got that golden son.

Also let's be real, when he's so desperate for that son he's basically saying ""my daughters aren't good enough for me"" "
"You have a child, a high-stress job, mental health issues, and all of the responsibilities of a ""successful"" adulthood (mortgage, home maintenance, bills, etc...).  And, if you're like the majority of women, you are spending more hours on household and family responsibilities than your husband (google the studies that have been done... on average, women get the raw end of the deal).

Your husband has no right to demand that you conceive, incubate, birth, and raise another child.  No right.

"
"This is the best answer. Shes upset over work functions, not personal ones. She has no say in those and it's more than enough to cut someone off. If in personal life, then fine. But work outings and work related things? Get outta here."
"&gt;We married on a quick whim after being head over heals for 6 months and I thought everything would be great.

Well, lesson learned there. 

&gt; I feel like such a bad husband having to hide things

Why are *you* the bad partner in this scenario? Why are you not ranting and raving about how you're married to someone who doesn't give a shit about you plural, your relationship, your family security? 

&gt;I try to talk to her but she gets very emotional about it and says my job choice is what's really causing money troubles.

And when you say ""but your lack of job is the problem"", I have a job and am earning money"", she says...? You've threatened to cancel her cards but not followed through, so she knows those are empty threats.

Time to be a hard ass. Frankly I'm amazed you've let it get this far - you're a military man, where's your spine? If ""something happens"" you can transfer her money as needed. Until then, cards are gone. She's demonstrated she can't be trusted with money, not your job to fund her debt fuelled lifestyle. End of story.

Work out a budget, with her if she'll play ball or alone if not. Work out what's left over after essential spending, debt payments, etc. You get half each (or whatever works for you). Separate accounts, debit card, no overdraft. That's her lot for the week, month, whatever. She pisses it up the wall? Sucks for her - she knew her budget. Not enough for her? Time to get a job.

Trouble is she doesn't want to change, doesn't see the need to change, wants to blame you for everything while she does fuck all. And don't get me wrong, I'm lazy, but financial realities can't be ignored. Living off debt is unsustainable. One way or another reality is going to smack you both in the face some day, so best prepare for it now.

But sorry to say from what you've said this won't work either, even if you stay strong in the face of tantrums. If she doesn't get it already I'm not sure she ever will, and the only things that might work are likely bankruptcy (which she'll blame you for) or divorce. So try my suggestion, but the best advice is retrospective, and it's ""don't marry someone you've only known 6 months, and don't marry someone without having all the really boring adult conversations about money, kids, etc. first"". Might not be too useful this time, but if this relationship doesn't work out, bear it in mind next time around. "
"The fact that this is the first time means you CANNOT gloss over it. You cannot let this go, otherwise it sets the precedent that he can yell at you like that and you'll just take it.

Go out, keep yourself busy. You can have fun by yourself, you don't have to have it with just him."
"You seem to be trying to audition for the gf position when he has no intention of ever casting you for that part. To him you are someone he can use for sex, lifts and other domestic chores. 

Because he only sees you as a fuck buddy and has no other feels for you he doesn't think you'd be bothered by him being honest about him intending to sleep with other women.. but you are so you are clearly feeling more from him than he does for you. Give him notice to leave and say it's been fun but that's it now.... you will end up hurt by him."
"&gt;He said that if he had to choose only one person to keep in his life, he’d pick her.

If my husband ever said this to me, I’d file for divorce. This in itself is just plain disrespectful. You deserve better. 

Lying to you is also not ok. I think you need therapy to figure out why you’re willing to allow someone to treat you this way."
... for the rest of his life.
Oh and not to mention throwing your income at you and using that to insinuate that you're a lazy free loader. ABSOLUTELY NOT OKAY.
"&gt;Yesterday a member of upper management came in to talk to me because I’ve been accused of bullying. 

Do you have any evidence of this meeting?  An email, phone call, notes, anything?

If you haven't already done so, sit down as soon as you can, while your memory is fresh, and write down every detail of the conversation.  Date, start time and end time of the conversation, who was present, who may have witnessed it, every single detail you can recall of what was said to you and how you responded.  

&gt;Just of note: excellent performance reviews, first person in 3 years to get 100% on a mystery shop evaluation in this sales region, got a raise ahead of my one year wage review because of how impressed they are with my work.

Make sure you have secure copies of those positive performance reviews and evidence you've been a stellar employee.

This seems very odd to me, that an upper-management person would show up unannounced, alone, and make vague accusations.
Did this person offer any suggestions for improvement, specific ways you should interact with employees, etc.?

I tend to agree with the friend who said to hire a lawyer and discuss the situation.  

Alternatively, send the management person who accused you of bullying a brief email recapping the events.  Something along the lines of:

&gt;I'd like to recap our conversation of September 10.  You arrived at my workplace at 123 Main Street and asked to speak to me.  During that conversation, you expressed concern about an allegation made by an unnamed employee that I was engaging in bullying in the workplace.  You made no reference to any specific instance or specific employee.  The accusations were vague, yet during the course of the conversation you indicated my employment with this company could possibly be terminated.

&gt;I very surprised at your accusations, as my work record shows I have been a strong asset to this company.  If my interactions with anyone in this company have been construed as bullying, I would like to address the situation openly and honestly.  If you, or anyone else in management feels I need direction or re-training in employee relations, I am more than happy to fulfill those requirements.

Send a blind copy to this person's supervisor, and anyone else you feel needs to know.  

I just pounded that out as a sample of how you should document the encounter.  You should modify it as necessary.

But don't let this pass.  The guy showed up and offered vague threats, which is extraordinarily unprofessional.  

Respond to him in the most professional way possible.  Don't mention a lawyer or lawsuit, but your words can make it clear that the thought has crossed your mind."
"I work from home, as a developer, and my girlfriend with a normal 9-5 doesn’t make me feel bad for it. It’s a sweet gig and he sounds very jealous."
"I think it's totally reasonable for you to not go for the reasons you describe. The only thing I would encourage you is not to make up an excuse - if you've already balked a little in the group chat, they'll see through what you say if it's a fake reason. The right thing to do since you're standing up for yourself is just to be honest as clearly and cleanly as possible. Something like ""After a lot of thought, I've decided not to join you for the group's new plan. I was really looking forward to celebrating with you, but I just don't feel safe driving that far under the conditions that are predicted for this weekend. I hope you all have a great time and look forward to hearing all about it!"""
"Wtf, that's not tuning, that's being a disruptive show off! I would say, ""Girlfriend, you might not have realized this, but it can be distracting when one person starts practicing a piece of music while everyone else is trying to tune their instruments. It makes it harder to tune. I say this because the last couple of practices, I noticed you were practicing the piece while we were tuning and it was a little distracting."" I would approach her from the assumption that she isn't operating in bad faith, even though she probably is tbh."
"It sounds like you've been a passenger in this relationship for the length of it. Maybe it's time to do some driving and end things. If you don't trust her to  use birth control correctly, this isn't a relationship worth staying in."
"We haven't merged accounts, luckily. Everything's separate."
"Your 18 and you are seeing a 43 year old. One who insists he's not interested in a relationship with you.

"I'm from Utah. I'm very familiar with Mormons.


I don't think you're going to win this one, sorry :( "
"I'm your mom's age and I just want to hug you right now.

Your mother has serious MH issues and almost certainly has since you were a child. You're not the problem here.  She's emotionally abusive (""I get along with everyone but you"" is classic abuser/gaslighter BS).  It is so beyond abnormal for someone to try to jump out of a moving car and then to bite the hand of someone who's trying to keep you from doing that -- it's mind-boggling.

Unfortunately, we're so conditioned to think that, *of course our mothers love us*, that it's hard to see that sometimes that's not the case and that sometimes, even when they might love us in their own warped way, their influence in our lives can be so toxic that it's not healthy to continue the relationship.  If she weren't your mother, would you ever allow her to treat you this way? Would you maintain a relationship with someone who bit you?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't know how you can push someone to be like this, but somehow I manage to do it, and this has been going on for 10 years.

This breaks my heart. Please, please, you've got to understand that you are not the cause of this problem. Stop punishing yourself for this situation, because these patterns were set when you were too little to have ever had the agency to have set the tone of the relationship.

As difficult as it may be, I honestly think you should walk away from your relationship with her.  Perhaps someday, you'll be strong enough to understand that you're not causing her to behave the way she does and you'll be able to let her toxicity wash over you instead of wounding you. But don't feel like it's your fault if that day never comes.

&amp;#x200B;"
"The truth is, it's definitely not the first time, and it probably will happen again.  You're only 3 months in at this point.  Nothing wrong with saying 'hey this doesn't work for me' and moving on."
"Now **that** is an update!  Congrats on your nice life, OP.  Say hi to your ~~plundered booty~~ boyfriend for us!"
"Oh good lord yes! I love this and it's not a mean girl thing to do. It's the god dam truth. She's being an embarrassing weirdo who thinks she's cooler than everyone because she likes certain music, is she 14?"
"You told the truth, and he probably needed to hear it. Maybe he was coming from a place of genuine understanding about how bad his actions towards you were, maybe not - maybe he just wanted to apologise to assuage his own guilt, and have you reassure him that you forgive him (likely simply because many people are polite in those ways because it's expected, not out of honesty) because that means he can draw a line under everything in his own mind and not change at all. 

(The fact that he asked for forgiveness rather than simply apologising kind of suggests that explanation, tbh. If I were in his shoes I'd apologise, maybe say ""I hope you can forgive me"" but not expect an answer, especially not then and there. Asking for your forgiveness only serves to soothe HIS conscience.)

Anyway, there are good faith and bad faith ways of reading the situation, but either way, you were polite, spoke the truth, and told him something he needed to hear about the impact of his actions on others. He might go on to act differently now."
"Nothing wrong with wanting sex, that’s normal. But when you’re busy or stressed or dealing with shit, he needs to be a big boy and stop pouting like you took away his favorite toy. Four days is nothing. 

I would speak to him and say “I know you want sex. Hey, I fucking love sex. But I’m busy and I’m stressed and it’s hard to get in the mood, especially when you’re acting cold towards me and unsupportive. When I come home from a long day and you’ll barely speak to me, how is that supposed to make me frisky? How is that supposed to make me get in the mood?”"
"Since he discontinued the relationship, I don’t think you’re under any obligation to tell him. It’s your body, you’re sure about your decision, and he’s not a part of your life. If you tell him, he’ll be an audience to a very emotional situation in which he has no say or control. If you need financial help with the procedure or think there’s a real chance you two will have any close relationship in the future, including platonic friendship, you would likely want to be more open and forthcoming. Otherwise, it’s your personal medical business, and it’s up to you who gets to know about it."
I fear for any woman this guy meets. Textbook creep.

"She was 15. This was rape. If she is willing to go to the police, support her and be there every step of the way. Support her by helping find a therapist or a crisis center. He preyed upon her and is a criminal. She is a victim and none of it is her fault. "
"Given your parents' controlling behavior, why on earth would you want to work where he works? "
"This is a fundamental incompatibility. Your husband wants to be half of a high-earning power couple; you want to pursue a career where you can feel meaningful &amp; are willing to sacrifice income for that. Honestly, this should’ve been a dealbreaker when you decided you wanted to switch careers. I’m not really interested in which of you is “right” - the bigger picture issue is that you made a big life decision that changed the trajectory of your future &amp; neither one of you acknowledged at the time that this would significantly alter your lives together. You would no longer be the “power couple” because you personally don’t share those values. You don’t share his views on image, &amp; he doesn’t share your views on altruistic career paths. 

As other people have suggested, when there’s income disparity, the basic solutions are to pay 50/50 &amp; live at the lower earner’s income level or to pay as a percentage of overall household income &amp; live at the higher earner’s level (or closer to it). However, both of these options require your husband to compromise on his own life goals of image &amp; power couple-hood, which he is explicitly unwilling to do. Do at this point, I think you need to acknowledge that there’s a giant incompatibility here. "
"She may very well have been bullied or had people purposefully exclude her...and when that happens, sometimes people stop trying to make friends (particularly making the first move) as they tend to think they'll get the same treatment.

I can empathize. I'm an introvert. I have friends I've made. I also have friends I wouldn't have made if they didn't make the first move because I was once bitten, twice shy. I moved around a lot growing up, so I had a fair share of being excluded or treated badly as the new kid. It takes a certain personality and a certain level of support to get through it.

I don't necessarily see this as a red flag.. Just something to be aware of and maybe help with, if she wants."
"You can love and support both your sisters at the same time. However in this case your youngest sister is in serious jeopardy. Anorexia can absolutely take her life. Ashley seems to antagonize her and put her down, making Chloe feel worse about herself. She (Chloe) needs removed from the situation. You can tell Ashley you love her and care for her, however at this time Chloe needs to be with you to heal and get healthy. Maybe spend one on one time with Ashley a few weekends a month. But absolutely bring Chloe home with you. "
"&gt; the prostitute said that he was too big

😂🤣😅🤣😅🤣😂🤣😂🤣

Yeah she didn’t. What utter bullshit. 

Ok so I did go to a prostitute but we didn’t have sex. Both because I didn’t get hard *and* because even flaccid, this experienced sex worker could see my majestic penis would be too much for her. 

Come on. 

Let go of him. You’re missing him because he’s familiar and you miss how sweet to used to (or seemed to) be. 

There is no such thing in the world as the time a guy went to a prostitute, making him realize how much his girlfriend really meant to him. "
You know how kids like always ask which child a parent loves best.  Kids have a favorite parent too.   Kids love compassion and caring.  They love structure and predictability.  It sounds like your girls don't always know how your wife will react or it tends to be badly.  You respond calmly and rationally.  They feel safe talking to you.   I suggest family therapy.  Your wife can build that same relationship too but everyone needs to be on the same page 
It sounds more like an addiction problem than a mid-life crisis. Any history or signs of pill abuse? Any needle marks on her? Drug paraphernalia? 
"Honestly, it sounds like it was the right thing to do. You can't put your life on hold forever, waiting around for the brother to get off his lazy ass and move out. Your boyfriend needs to be an adult and kick his mooching brother out. I am 100% certain that this wasn't a ""live with my brother indefinitely"" agreement, and when the brother first moved in, their was a timeline by when he was going to be out. But it just kept getting pushed back farther and farther, and each time a deadline passed he had some sob story about why he couldn't find his own place. 

Your boyfriend needs to stand up to his family and tell them he's a 30 year old man, he isn't obligated to take care of his equally adult brother. He can move back in with them if he's so hard up.

Now, the important part; stick to your guns OP. If he isn't gone and you waffle and stay on the 30th, they'll keep walking all over you forever."
"Hi there, I was born two months early at 2lbs, 2ozs. My dads wedding ring fit around my wrist like a bracelet. I was a NICU baby, was behind on a few milestones at first, but caught up just fine and the rest is history.

I am so sorry you and your wife are going through this, but as a kid who had a lot of medical issues when I was born, I remember none of it and only remember how awesome and loving my parents are. 

Wishing you all the best.

Is the nickname more like “sexy” or more like Mike? 
"The only reason it's called ""family plan"" is really just because it's catchier. ""Group of people willing to all connect their accounts plan"" doesn't have the same ring to it."
"He'll lie to you and say it was a one-time thing, she didn't really mean anything to him, he was just lying to her and/or he was going through some stuff and didn't know how to talk to you about it, so he found someone else to listen.  

He'll promise to do better, agree to counselling, say you can look on his phone anytime, start calling you throughout the day to assure you of where he is at all times.

Then, he'll get horny again and find another victim.  He might meet her on line or at the gym or on the job.  I guarantee you he is not done cheating.

I also guarantee you that you are not the problem and that nothing you do will stop him from doing this again.  And everytime he does it and you find out, a little piece of your self-esteem will be gone.

Please listen to these posters and really consider what the future holds."
"&gt;For context: part of why I freaked out is because he’s been leaving the house late at night lately so I can’t help but think the worst. (Like leaving at 1 a.m. and coming back at 3 a.m.) He also gets mad when I ask him where he’s going.
&gt;

The unanswered messages/calls are the least of your problems. You should be thinking the worse. Nobody ventures out into the world repeatedly at 1-3am for anything wholesome or positive. I think its pretty telling that he gets mad and defensive when you ask him where he is going when most of the world is asleep. Drugs or sex. Or both.

"I scrolled through the comments and just wanted to say something that I didn't see anywhere else. I agree with the general consensus that you are making the right decision, u/chocolatehummus.


Please don't fall trap to the idea that there is ""the One"" out there for you and that you just dumped him. It's not as romantic, but the truth is, there are many people out there that could be ""the One"" for you. It is incredibly rare that you find someone who checks all the boxes - personalities can mesh perfectly, but different sex drives can end things. All the circumstances can line up (social circles, common goals, timing, etc), but you lack the passion. The best lover in the world can have a totally opposite parenting style and it falls apart. 

Lifelong romance isn't exclusively about how much love there is between two people. Extenuating circumstances can drive two people who are seemingly perfect for each other apart. It's worse when people try to cling to that original love and bury their heads away from the real problems (Sunk cost fallacy). 

It will take you a long time to get over this, but you will. It would be a lot harder to leave in six months when you realize you're not being true to yourself. You made an incredibly mature choice. "
Don't sleep with him again and let him know you are ready to hear his explanation when he is ready but it's not okay for him to disappear and then refuse to tell you what happened. That isn't how you treat a partner. At this point he is trying to rug sweep and you should stop letting him just pop in and out and walk all over you. Even if something traumatic happened this isn't a healthy way for him to deal with it and your relationship.

"Nothing wrong with his stance of being uncomfortable with this. He communicated it to you openly and appropriately.

The obvious answer is to just leave when they go to the strip club and call it a night (or meet up with them afterwards). When you make your excuse don't pin it on your BF because that will make him the bad guy when he doesn't deserve to be.

Just say something along the lines of this to the bride before the event via text or the next time you see her:

""Hey just an FYI that I'm going to dip out when you guys head to the strip club. I've thought about it and I'm just not very comfortable going for a variety of reasons. No biggie but I just wanted to let you know. I'm excited to see you this weekend!""

"Read ""She Divorced Me Because I Left the Dishes by the Sink"" and ""She Feels Like Your Mom and Doesn't Want to Bang You"".    The issues are the same with reversed genders:  Your girlfriend isn't stepping up to being an adult partner when it comes to maintaining the household and is being disrespectful to you.

Have her read the articles then be honest in your discussion with you.  If she doesn't step up, there's really no point in talking about a future marriage because your resentment will erode the relationship.

Start by jointly developing a chore chart.  For each task, clearly describe what ""meets requirements"" mean then assign the chores.   Discuss and revise the chart weekly."

The bf talks like their relationship is great apart from a small minor thing, but they have tons of problems. No romance, poor sex, poor intimacy, he doesn't notice or compliment her.  He sees nothing wrong with cheating. He has been emotionally cheating, at least. He admits he sees nothing wrong with it and plans to do it again. He doesn't respect her or considers what she wants.

Even if we take out this hurtful thing he said I'd still be like ""Girl. What have you seen to make you think this is OK and not a waste of your time?'"

"I agree, this is very childish. I work from home about 50% of each day and I would never expect my husband to come home for a 10-15 minute chore when I'm already at home. Your wife is an adult; all working adults know that it's not cool to ask for time off right off the bat at a new job. It doesn't matter if she knew how many days off you're allowed now; the more important point is that she shouldn't put you in a position to start off on the wrong foot at a new job. Stop feeling bad about it. If anything, I would be pretty irritated with her about making me waste PTO time. And adding to my new job stress. "
"This guy sounds like an entitled piece of shit to be honest. Can go down the checklist pretty easily. Behaves poorly enough in a leadership role that he is removed and has the risk of being suspended or expelled. Rich parents will probably have the power to prevent that. Asking his replacement to step down so he can have his former role back, if he gets through his hearing.

Honestly I can't see him getting his position back unless the university wants to basically admit they were wrong in removing him, over something that seems to be fairly common knowledge at this point. 

&gt;My question is this: Am I right to be salty about this?

Yes, the fact that you are even questioning your anger shows that you are a vastly better person than this guy. He never questioned how it would make you feel when he asked you to step down, he just wants that position. 

&gt;I don't know how I am supposed to react moving forward without risking our friendship or seeming power hungry

I don't know how you can seem power hungry here, if anything the guy asking you to step down is power hungry because he was removed from his position and now wants it back. 

&gt;. There's also a possibility that maybe I am wrong and being selfish, so please let me know if that is the case.

To compare who is more selfish the person who accepts a role after someone is removed, and refuses to step down. Or the person who was removed from that role asking the person in it to step down.

Basically what this guy is saying ""I did nothing wrong, I still deserve to be in this position because of who I am, and you need to step down to let me achieve this.""

It's fairly clearly you know he fucked up as well, unless you also believe he did nothing wrong do not step down.

"ps i went through your post history, and I honestly cannot figure out what you get out of this marriage to this person."
"You come off as fairly dismissive here, if that is how you talk with your partner as well that will make resolution difficult.  You ""aren't sure"" of the negatives because the situation hasn't happened yet, but *are* sure of the positives?  That's inconsistent, and seems like you are downplaying her concerns.

Your post mentioned your partner being concerned about you being stuck between them if there is conflict - has that situation happened before?  Why does she feel like you won't have her back if something goes wrong?

Personally I wouldn't want to live with my partners mother (and I like her!), but if it were the best logistical choice I could perhaps tolerate it.  I would need conversations about ground rules first, some experience with positive conflict resolution between everyone involved, and for it to be a separate space like an in law suite or duplex.  I would also need to feel like my partner was part of my team, and was focusing on building a life with *me*, not dragging me around behind him while he focused on fulfilling the desires of his biological family above our relationship and my desires."

"&gt; Guys, emirite?

No, you're not right. Plenty of men are functional adult human beings and don't do stuff like this. Whether you date men or women, if your partner has a habit of a) saying they're going to do something they have no intention of doing or b) saying they DID something they didn't do, it's time for a serious conversation.

If your partner then reacts like OP's did, I don't know how you could respect them or feel respected by them to be honest. That's a huge level of irresponsibility and lack of accountability. ""Stuff just happens"" is how a child responds when they don't understand that they have failed to do something critical, not how an adult apologizes for the consequences of their own actions."

"There are a lot of resources online to help people who've grown up with controlling parents. You also sound like you would benefit from therapy to help figure out how to detach from your parents, your university should have free or low-cost options for you that would be worth your time and money. You know what you have to do, and if you've been with your BF for three years and want to marry him then moving in with him might not be a bad idea, at least until you get up on your feet. Your parents should not need to track your location when you're 24 and if they're not ok with you becoming the independent adult they raised you to become then that is their problem not yours. 

By the way, if I were your boyfriend I would have broken up with you after six months of this BS. He is a saint for putting up with it for three years, he must really love you. Don't lose him because you are afraid of standing up to your parents. "
"OP the food demands and overspending are all symptoms of a bigger issue. 

Based on your post history you are clearly in an abusive relationship. Your husband is verbally and financially abusing you. 

Screaming at you for hours after you tried to get needed therapy is abuse.

Closely monitoring, questioning, and controlling all of your purchases is abuse. 

Hoarding thousands of dollars of shared marital wealth into his own private checking account while you only have $100 to your name is abuse. 

Freezing your credit card so you can’t pay for therapy or other essentials is abuse. 

Forcing/guilting/strongly “encouraging” you to not have a job so you are 100% dependent on your husband is a control tactic of abusers. 

Isolating you from friends and family is a very common control tactic of abusers. 

**There are no words we can give you to convince your husband to change his ways. He likes the status quo of you being 100% financially dependent on him, isolated, and having to do all of the domestic duties. He is an abusive person and will not ever listen to you because you are his abuse victim. He does not respect you as his equal and he never will. You can’t make someone change when they don’t want to change.**

The *only* way you can change this situation for the better is to leave. Please reach out to your local women’s domestic violence shelter or the National Domestic Violence Hotline (thehotline .org) and talk to one of their counselors there. They can help you figure out a way to safely leave this abusive marriage if you want to. Talk to them before you make any decisions, and *DON’T* tell your husband what you are up to. Abusers can get violent or deadly when they think their victim is leaving them. 

Stay safe OP. "

From another comment of yours:

&gt;I'm currently locked in the bathroom but she keeps coming to me with vague reasons.

Uh, did you just lock yourself in the bathroom to escape her without asking her for some space? If my boyfriend did that, I'd knock to ask what was wrong, too. 

First, tell her how you feel. You want some time alone to process your grief, you might want to go and spend time with your family, or whatever. 

It's unfortunate that your GF isn't picking up on your cues, but this is when you need to be direct with her. If she continues disrespecting your wishes, temporarily block her and leave to be with your family. Or permanently block her and break up, whatever you need to do."

"OP, ""somehow"" the fiancee found out? Do you mean you were upset and confused and confided in your best friend and he shared the information with his fiancee, who shared the information with her friends? That wouldn't be surprising if that's the way it happened, but if it is, take ownership.

If you are serious about Sasha, you need to consider pulling out of the wedding. You also need to realize what that will mean for your friendship. Your friend and his fiancee are taking a hardline position, but it's not an unusual one, particularly for a wedding. 

Eta: What do you mean when you say Sasha is stunning and gets along with your male friends very well? Yes, she's attractive. But does she make a point of cozying up to men and shunning women? If this is the case, you should re-think your relationship with her. She may not be the kind of woman you want to make a life with.

"College professor here and I can tell you that this is crossing a number of lines. You seem to have three choices...

&amp;#x200B;

Choice 1 - Fight it by going to the Dean etc who would likely step in and help moderate the prof's expectations. BUT the prof may very well develop a grudge against you due to you going over his head and that may have very real ramifications later (e.g. bad mouthing you to potential employers). But he is clearly wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Choice 2 - Lie. Since it is honestly not his business at all what you do in your spare time, you could tell him that you accept the wisdom of his words and will be doing just that. If asked to submit a second schedule, simply change the ""work time"" to ""research"" or similar. This would make him happy and would make it very likely for him to be quite helpful to you. Yes, it would be distasteful to do this but you could turn it into a win.

&amp;#x200B;

Choice 3 - Simply be silent as it is HIGHLY unlikely to be brought up again. If he does mention it, simply smile and give him some bland response (e.g. Oh yes, I definitely see the wisdom of that strategy. Thank you for sharing your insights). It is not as satisfying as Choice 1 but it is not as dishonest as Choice 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I would go with Choice 3 since Choice 1 gets you into a pissing battle with a skunk (win a little but lose a lot) and Choice 2 is simply distasteful."

You are being asked for too much. You are also being asked to do things you are not equipped to do.

"Sometimes when you spend time talking to people who are open or poly they make the lifestyle sound so normal and accepted that you lose sight of how your average person actually feels about it.

Fora lot of monogamous people, even raising the idea seems like an affront to theagreement to be monogamous.

"All of these posts are about how ridiculously hard it is to get into medical school. I agree, I'm applying in June. But are you sure this is what your wife was telling you? Those are the words that came out of her mouth but what is she really trying to communicate? Without knowing much about your situation, I'm guessing that maybe she's feeling discontent with being a homemaker, and is desiring more responsibility outside of the house. Maybe she is feeling stuck in her current role and is overcorrecting. Sounds like something I would do, to be honest. 

My advice to you would be to do the following: 
1) tell her you will support her in whatever she wants to do. I'll bet you anything that she won't still want to go to med school after researching what that process entails. Let her go through that process her self. You can be the voice of reason, but if you immediately tell her she can't because it's too hard, you *will* come off as the controlling husband. And who knows, maybe she *will* still want to pursue it and that *is*her true calling. Then you get to support your partner in realizing a deeper level of life satisfaction and that's a beautiful thing.  
2) Work together to identify the root cause of her desire to be a doctor. Then work together to find a solution to that discontentment. 

You're the type of husband who will go and write a reddit post about this before immediately shutting her down reactively. Already, that tells me you got this! Maybe this could be the start for an exciting new chapter in your lives that could lead to a whole nother level of fulfillment. Best of luck!"

She wants this relationship so badly that she's grabbing at the first opportunity that appears to sound like something like that.

This won't end well, I bet. The signs are already there. People like them simply don't change so drastically and suddenly, it just isn't how things happen. I mean, she said:

&gt;(...)   having a relationship with them again where they don't blame us for stuff

But this:

&gt;They said it wouldn't have happened if we had just allowed them + my brother to live with us

They're still blaming them. Completely. They evidently didn't change anything about how they think, they just changed the approach to get closer to her again. I feel sorry for the OP, because this is going to blow so hard... I hope she can handle it well when it finally happens."

"By complaining to you about his coworker, he's setting the scene that he's not into her. He's manipulating you. So now you know they're flirting, and he's trying to hide it from you. Who know how far it's gone, but your spidey sense is tingling. 

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, my father created a similar scenario with a female co-worker that he worked with, some 30-odd years ago. Always complaining what a horrible person she was, everybody at the office hates her. He left my family for her and they've been married for 28 years.  Your post struck a nerve with me. "
"I mean...no. you DO smell. You admit to having a ""strong natural smell"", and she doesn't like it. A vanilla candle also has a ""strong smell"", crushed mint has a ""strong natural smell"", and paint thinner has a ""strong smell"". Whether or not it's bad is subjective; you think you're fine, she thinks you're not.




What you should do comes down to how much effort you want to put in. You know she doesn't like your natural smell. If you are willing to do more to cover it up (shower before seeing her, wear stronger deoderant/cologne), then you can do that! If you're not, break up with her, or tell her to like it or lump it. but you're never going to convince her that you smell good."
"That's the thing that really got me about this woman. 

She's not only lying about her education, which is a large portion of her past, but using it as a platform to belittle OP for his apparant inability to obtain an education that she never received herself."
"OP, i had an ex-boyfriend like this (emphasis on ""ex."") he had a distorted body image, but didn't just apply them to himself; he applied it to everyone around him. it was bad enough when he started calling me fat, but then he started calling my friends fat.

i'm going to be frank, your husband sounds self-absorbed, narcissistic, and abusive, and seeing as you have been a victim of abusive relationships, i think you've normalized his behavior despite him doing nothing to deserve your goodwill. it doesn't matter if he does and says nice things sometimes when he finds other outlets to abuse you. i'm not going to tell you what to do with this relationship, but i highly advise seeing a psychologist about your marriage and your dating history -- alone, without your husband."
"Girl. This man is 34 and is relying on you to pay all his bills? Does he even pay child support? And I don't believe the mother won't let him see her bs. He could get a lawyer and go to court is he really wanted to
 spend time with his child.

It will not get better. He already promised that twice and nothing changed. You deserve better."
"You don’t have to make yourself comfortable with this. Like, if this was happening to me it would be such a dealbreaker. It’s okay to be uncomfortable with your 22 year old girlfriend role playing as a baby. I don’t think there’s a way to work around something like that. "
"Get counseling or get divorced.  I don't really understand the ""we'll probably get divorced in 5-10 years"" comment.  If you feel that way why not do it now? "
"I dont even have a startup. This is op's fault. 

How does any entrepreneur blame their business failing on bad moving karma? "
This has “set up” written all over it.
"I'm really sorry about what's going on. Maybe just sit down and talk to him. Really talk to him. Tell him how you feel and that you're worried. If he is suffering from depression, which it sounds like, (I deal with it also), you need to let him know you are there. Some people, it takes a lot of time and convincing to get them to open up and talk about what's going on. I hope everything is ok. "
"Wait, wait, WAIT. 

&gt;He says physical attraction is very low on the list of what he looks for in a partner, and the flirting with the coworker was simply to fuel fantasies (because he IS attracted to her physically but not emotionally).

This makes literally no sense. 

""Gurl, physical isn't a big thing to me, but I'm using a co-worker's looks to get off""? But physically none of this is important? You are overweight for me, but no biggie. I'll just jerk it to co-worker. ??? Visual is important but then not? What in the world? 

Take your hot tush and date someone else. He is lying or confused, and you can find someone who finds you amazing. "
"*He's my best bud so I'd rather not hear the ""fuck this dude, drop him"".*

Don't be the kind of dude who enables guys to make women feel uncomfortable and unsafe. So what if he's your best friend? He might actually hurt someone one day, if he hasn't already.

Don't drink with him. Don't invite him when you go out. Don't enable a situation for him to be around women who are afraid around him. If he ever does it around you, don't just let him keep doing it, tell him to fucking leave. Tell him flat out why. That he displays predatory behavior around women and you think he might actually hurt a girl. Tell him that girls are afraid of him and actively avoid him.

And put up a boundary. Sure, hang out with him one on one if you want, but don't go out with him in this context. He's shown you who he is, though. Might be worth it to find some friends who actually respect women."
It sounds like your husband doesn't respect you. You shouldn't feel like your being dismissed when it's your body doing the hard work. This is a lot to ask your depressed wife. 
"You aren't being selfish. The relationship isn't just ""you and him"" anymore, the relationship is ""you, him, the baby, and the other girl"".

If you can handle it, then props to you! If not, there is nothing wrong about it.

Although definitely tell him to take a paternity test."
"Minister here. 

I've performed more weddings than I can even remember at this point, and I will tell you this:

Do not have someone at your wedding that you do not *want* at your wedding, simply because of a sense of ""should"".

Blood relationship is not a suicide pact, and if you suspect that your mother will damage the day, do not have her there.  Your step-father doesn't even have the ""blood relationship"" tenuous leg to stand on. 

Your wedding is (hopefully) a once-in-a-lifetime event.  It's the day that you step before one another, and friends, and family, and the law, and (if you're religious) the Infinite Divine as you perceive it, and declare your love for one another; the ceremony and celebration should be representative of what is to come in your future, and if you do not want toxicity in your future, do not allow toxicity at your wedding.

You need to tell them how you feel and why they will not be invited.  If they take their toys and go home and refuse to talk to you for a few years as a result, that sounds like a bonus, given how you have described them.

Your fiance deserves his wedding day to be toxicity-free.

*You* deserve your wedding day to be toxicity-free.

I'd tell you exactly the same thing if you were a couple I was officiating for."
"Your boss is your HR then.

I had something similar. A coworker smelled something terrible but no one seemed to notice or care. I have a feeling that, just as you were desensitized to farm smells, they became desensitized to her smell. 

It's strange how similar the situations are. Except I only worked with her on rare occasions but I was looking to see if anyone else noticed, I even went sniffing the office after they all left one day to make sure it was really her."

Family plans are not just for families.... they are just marketed towards families... How dense is your bf? Has he been living under a rock - how is he this sheltered and unable to think critically for himself? He sounds like exactly the type of guy who would believe any kind of fake news cause he would never even think of questioning it.

"I would tell your supervisor and/or HR about his sexual harassment.

It’s not your job to protect this dude and I highly doubt this is the first time he has done this or the last."
"I think that her response was actually very well thought out and written respectfully. You can’t dictate how a POC should feel regarding the history their communities have faced and unjustness they continue to face. And each POC has a different take and position in regards to it. Your position and perspective on what’s ridiculous in this regard doesn’t matter.

I think she is trying to be as accommodating as she can be with you, while maintaining her stand. Especially since this conversation has already happened before, where she had clearly expressed her thoughts. You assumed what you wanted, that she was being “overly sensitive” and thought she’d get over it, and essentially lied to her."
"Maybe reply with a, “what makes you think they’ll want you? I’m just being honest” see how it’ll make him feel. Sorry you had to even hear him say such a purposefully hurtful thing. "
"Did you ever stop and think about Verizons P/E ratio or EPS? No, I bet you didn't. Those poor executive officers are going to have to go to the board and explain why EPS is $1.12 per share instead of $1.13 per share. They might get a slightly smaller bonus at the end of the fiscal year. "
"&gt;I've come here to seek advice on 2 matters - firstly, should I tell my boyfriend about this? 

Why *wouldn't* you tell your BF about this? Hiding it makes you look like you feel guilty. You have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. You should absolutely tell your BF.


&gt;Secondly, he's texted me multiple times since then and I've not responded. Is it a horrible thing to just ghost him?

Of course it's not horrible. He behaved reprehensibly, you owe him nothing."
"You **do not** have to wait until he directly asks you out! The next time he approaches you, say directly to him: “Chris, leave me alone.”

Don’t smile, don’t soften it, don’t apologize, and don’t make it ambiguous. Do it in front of the people you’re with at the time, even if it’s ‘embarrassing’ and ‘you’re a nice person’ and you ‘don’t want to make waves’! You need to be nice to *yourself* and assert your boundaries! 

Hang out with people who make you feel safe and will back you up. If **anyone** tells you to give him a second chance or that you’re too harsh or other bullshit, drop that person. People who would sacrifice your comfort and safety to the altar of their own expectations are your enemies, not your friends. 

Edited to add: See if your school offers any female-only self defense classes. I took one as a student and it made a huge difference in my confidence and my ability to say “NO” to creepers. "
this needs to be reported to protect other girls. 
"Your husband is an abuser. The fact that he may also have a personality disorder is irrelevant and does not in *any way* give him a pass for his abusive behavior. 

It is highly unlikely that you will ever get him to understand or change his behavior. In all honesty, unless you're willing to accept living this way for the rest of your life, your best course of action is to leave him."
"You had bad sex ONCE and it's made you never pursue it again?

Come on now. Stop being a baby. You did not 'fall out of love.'"
"Right. Sounds like he is just jealous and wants to take control of the situation. OP is just savvy, nothing unethical about that. He'd probably change his tune if someone offered to let him join their 'family'."
Maybe that’s why he’s storing so much fat now.

"I really believe you can do this. No-contact is your only good response at this point. As a woman, this guy makes my skin crawl. I know the type, I know they are too often tolerated as harmless weirdos or socially awkward geeks, but what they are is dangerous creeps. Just cut him out. Protect yourself and your property from any strange reactions and behaviours of his.

Wherever there is an institution, there is responsibility. I cannot fathom that there isn't some sort of emergency protocol for situations just like this. A swap with a friend of his, if he has any, or an emergency accommodation in a different complex, perhaps. Or at least have yourself put on a waitlist for a swap as soon as a vacancy opens up.

Really, best of luck. This is a crap situation and I'm sorry you have to go through this.

&amp;#x200B;"
Are you a member of r/nicuparents ? Also does your NICU have support systems? 
That's what dad said. He said buy the car yourself if you want a new one. 
"I would be annoyed too. It seems really unreasonable for her to make you take time off work to go home when she was already there and I don't know why she didn't realize that one of you had to take time off for those things, why her doing it wouldn't have been the most convenient. Either you weren't clear about how much time you'd have to take off or were taking off but even then that seems like her just being willfully dense. 

Let her be annoyed and make your feelings clear, explain it how you wrote it out here. I wouldn't take any more time off and save the three days. Instead just go out to dinner and have date night for your anniversary. It sounds like she doesn't really understand what your job change would mean for your lifestyle. "
"Working on yourself is a heck of a lot more powerful than him getting engaged. You should be so proud of the work you’ve put into yourself, that’s truly amazing stuff. "
"&gt; He already has a 5 year old with his ex...we only see the daughter twice a month, and he struggles with trying to be ""daddy"". He hates it.

Until he can be a half-decent parent to his preexisting kid, he shouldn't be having more, period.

&gt; if having children is one of my ""definite life goals"" we may have to break up

This seems crystal clear.

&gt; I'm clinging onto the hope that this is stopping him from picturing children right now at all.

Stop ""clinging onto the hope"" that your BF will change his mind later, and accept what he's telling you now. He's aggressively uninterested in being a parent, and he does not think it's likely kids are in his future.

If having children is something you need, then he is not the right long-term partner for you. If you're afraid of being ""37 and childless"", it's time to start building a relationship with someone who shares the same desire for children, so you can meet your personal timelines.

One more note: there is a non-zero chance that when you break up with your partner because of this, he'll ""change his mind"", and decide he ""could want kids"" if it means staying together. **Do not let this sway you**. Either he'll be lying (to you and/or himself), and won't ever actually go through with having kids...or he'll have them and be a resentful, absent parent (like he's already currently doing with his daughter)."
You posted my comment for me! I had to look back at the ages. He's 50 and cannot take responsibility when things go wrong? 
"So I faced this exact problem last month in my dorm. I was randomly paired with a new student after my roommate dropped out. This new chick had no concept of quiet or peace. She would wake up at the ass crack of morning and start clattering about with toiletries/slamming the closet door/slamming the door on her way in or out, which she needed to do 7 or 8 times in the 2 hours she took between waking up and leaving the room for the day. I spoke to her gently, about 6 or 7 times, sometimes right after she slammed the door. I would follow her out and say, ""Hey so you just slammed the door again"". This usually prevented her from doing it for a few days.

My story doesn't have a happy ending because I had to speak to my RA and request a change of roommate after she woke me up twice at 4 am to complain of a tummy ache/headache. I was apprehensive of approaching them but if it's affecting your sleep and your quality of work as a result, I believe that's solid grounds for a complaint in most dorms. Look up the student handbook, just in case."
"&gt;I've tried to tell her the benefits

What about the drawbacks? Have you talked about those?"
"Personally I'd take that information as all the MORE reason to divorce because it means this must be  some kind of half-assed fucked-up badly-planned brinskmanship ploy to get some specific reaction out of you. And it's not like SHE told you this to your face. (Either that or she paniced when she realised the financial implications.)

I guess you could sign up for couples counselling to try to get to the bottom of what she's actually up to, what she actually wants, but IMHO that's unlikely to work: plus as you say, she's shot herself in the foot here by shooting down all your attempts to resolve this.

TBH I think you'd be happier not married to someone who plays stupid games and makes you feel like shit."
"Also 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;are there people who don't have red flags?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, there are lots and lots of people about whom I wouldn't say this: 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;I don't even know if she actually owns the businesses she actually  claims she owns.  Maybe she's not from an absurdly wealthy family and  just living off some finite inheritance or insurance settlement.  I  really don't know anything about her now that I think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know how you think you are going to have a loving, trusting relationship with someone whose passport you are pretty sure is fake."
"This is not a huge ask. You seem to know what you should do, it’s time to woman up and do it. You’ve been setting yourself on fire to keep him warm. Did you (and be honest with yourself) secretly think that if you sacrificed and accommodated his issues he would eventually “get it” and miraculously turn into the person “you know he could be?”  That’s not going to happen.

Yes you’ve sunk a lot of time and effort into him. But don’t beat yourself up about that and don’t let that feel like you can’t leave. We all make mistakes. Just don’t let making a mistake force you to keep making the same one. You deserve to be with a partner that thinks about your feelings, compromises, and makes you feel loved, cared for, and respected. Go find them. "
"I feel like deep down OP knows that it's wrong but she wanted to be able to say ""See? My black friend is here, it's not THAT bad."""
"So everything is okay because you can buy clothes now? 

Part of the problem is that it doesn't sound like he ever really apologized and showed any remorse. If he still thinks he didn't do anything wrong, you'd be silly to just move on. He showed you who he was. 

Why are you staying where you have a lousy job and a lousy marriage and where you don't like it, far from your family and friends? "
"OP just so you know punching a person behind their head is really dangerous it can kill that person instantly or it can damage the cervical vertebrae and subsequently spinal cord which may lead to irreparable spinal cord injury. This happend in soccer a player punched behind the head of a referee and he died in 2 days. What that kid did is really dangerous

Edit:Just for example we all had those moments in highschool where we get slapped in the neck. When you get slapped in the neck also you will struggle to standup or even walk or shaken up because cerebellum got hit at that moment. cerebellums job is to balance your body. What i mean by balance is it helps you stay on your feet helps you walk and coordinate."
"So you've been together 4 years (and I take it live together?) and he doesn't trust you with $40.

You think it through."
"&gt; She needs to be working or in collage and learning that actions have consequences.

Absolutely. You cannot keep living in high school mode for ever and not expect your life to go to crap. This is even true of the people that society tends to love - attractive standard-deviation types and so forth. 

It's a sad truth, but minorities have to be better to prosper or even survive. They need to be kinder, more patient, smarter, harder working, better social skills, and so on. Otherwise the crap they take will bring them down. Ashley is going to have a long, hard road ahead of her, but shielding her from the consequences of being an asshole won't make any of it easier. "
"It's not your fault. You're not responsible for her decisions and you didn't 'drive her' to anything. She is the parent. Her attempting to throw herself out of the car is actually kind of symbolic: you've been steering, and she's been the one deciding to derail things. 

What she did was unbelievably dangerous, and I'd have a tough time being around her after that, let alone the abuse and manipulation beforehand (and for years, by the sound of it). Yes, 100% go no contact. OP she could have killed you both with that stunt. You're more than justified in putting her in time out for a while, possibly indefinitely. "
"They're using your dead baby as a weapon to hurt you and your wife. If you don't cut them out, then you're being a bad partner to your wife. It's really hard to go No Contact with parents, but you have to think about yourself and your partner. You're choosing to allow them to upset and hurt yourself, and your wife. At the minimum, she should never have to talk, see, or hear about them again. If you want to continue a relationship with them, well then that's up to you. But your wife doesn't deserve to be subjected to their abuse just because she married you.

You should post to /r/JUSTNOMIL to get some amazing advice. They are very, very good with this type of situation and it's a wonderful support sub. It may be tough for you to hear at first, because there definitely will be some criticism that you've allowed your parents to treat you (and particularly your wife) like this, but you'll probably learn so much from posting there."

"You don't need to ask if it's okay for this to be a dealbreaker- you get to decide that.  If you're wondering how others would feel I think it's safe to say that this would be a dealbreaker for almost everyone.  It's one thing to explore the idea of an open relationship together because it's something you both find exciting and something else entirely for someone to come and say ""Hey, I cheated on you.  Can we make this an open relationship so I can feel okay about it?  It was really fun and I want to do it again!""  Just no.  Don't ever settle for being someone else's plan b.  You could be with a guy who thinks you are the whole package.  Dump this loser and go find him!"

"The expectations rarely end at the child's genitals. My husband jokes that our daughter is the son his father has always wanted. Both my FIL and my daughter are extroverts, who like interacting with people, like being outdoor, and like sports/physical activities. My husband is very introvert, very shy, likes to read, has a high IQ (not to brag, but to indicate my FIL simply couldn't relate to certain topics/struggles), and isn't good at sports due to being very tall (growing really fast messed up his motor skills). My FIL has a hard time interacting with his son, but loves spending time with his granddaughter. It makes my husband sad to see he was just not what his father wished for.

I'm the third child of four. After two daughters, my parents were expecting a son. It was the 80s, so it was common to learn about your baby's gender at birth. My father taped my birth with 8 mm film, so no audio, but my father finds it hilarous you can still read from my mother's lips what she said right after my birth. He also finds it hilarous to show people this tape. (Yes, there's something wrong with him.) Right after I was born, the midwife put me on my mother's stomach. My mother immediately grabbed my legs to check my genitals and said: ""It's another girl again."" The first thing I did was disappoint my parents and it wouldn't be the last time due to unrealistic expectations.

After my birth my mother got an IUD. It failed and then my brother was born.  We're they happy after that? No, because children are bad employees. Don't hire them to make you happy or to complete your life in a specific way. Do not give children that job before they are even born or after that. It's not their job to make their parents happy.
I don't mind not being what my parents wanted, but I do mind being concieved to fill a vacancy for a specific job."

"Do NOT move in with her!

Tell her that you want to see she had X amount of money saved up before you guys get a place together. See if she's capable of doing that.

"Start the eviction notice now, it's not a fast process. If they don't leave by the 30 days, you still need to take them to court to have them thrown out. Tenant rights usually favor the tenants and what you think may take 30 days will realistically take 3-4 months if they put up a fight legally."
"So...he's violent, abusive, violates consent regularly and didn't care that you might have had breast cancer? I'm trying to figure out why the hell you are with this guy. You're in an abusive relationship. You should absolutely leave."
Your roommate has major mental issues that only a highly trained therapist can help her with. 
Have a friend/s help you. Take a photo/video of everything in the condition that you’re leaving it. And don’t tell him anything until after you’ve moved. Don’t give him a chance to lose it.
"Wow. Your friend is garbage. 

Ok, I could say in detail while I think these things, but here’s what I think. 
It sucks that he didn’t tell you for 3 months. Major trust issues. Have a serious talk about how cowardly that was and how if he ever expects to stay together after something happens again, you better be told immediately. And besides that, honestly he wasn’t out of bounds. It sucks and it’s hurtful, but I’d forgive him. 

Your friend is a total c word. She orchestrated that shit. She likely had him in her crosshairs for a while and then saw an opportunity. What she did to you is horrible. On a certain level, it sounds like she knew enough about him, knew enough about you, used those tools, LIED to him, and seduced him. On top of that she blackmailed him into telling you and is still actively trying to get with him. Fuck. Her. Forever. Burn book. She is not on your fucking team. She is excommunicated. "
"'I understand you will feel uncomfortable in that dress because of the low back. You don't have to be embarrassed about scars.How about you help me choose a dress you like?'

1 - make several recordings of the sounds with time stamps.
2 - Give your neighbor a polite but firm warning note on their door
3 - Make a noise complaint to your building manager and provide the recording
4 - persist, and call the police over a noise disturbance if you have to

"This happened to me. I told him because I needed help paying for it. HUGE mistake, the dude turned into a psycho about it and made my life pretty shitty, worse than the ol aborto did. Don't tell him, there's no point. Just going to make a pretty simple situation unnecessarily complicated.

"You've been together eight years, and you thought you had a future together. All that got ripped away without warning. I'm not surprised you're still having such a hard time - you didn't just lose your fiancée, you lost your future and your faith in love.

It's going to be rough. No doubt about it.

For now, all you can do is...let it be rough. Don't beat yourself up over feeling that way - just feel it. But keep trying to live your life. If you feel you might benefit from it, there's no shame in talking to a therapist. Having an objective person there to give support can be an amazing thing.

And some day, whether it's in a few weeks or a few years, you'll realize: You haven't thought of her in a while. Or: You can think of her without feeling empty or like you're being stabbed in the heart.

Maybe, eventually, another woman will catch your eye. Maybe you'll decide to focus on yourself rather than risk this pain - or maybe you'll decide to take a chance, because whatever the risks, love can make your life so much better.

You don't have to decide now. You don't have to believe it. You don't have to make yourself promises over what you will and won't do. You'll find out when you get there.

The key now is to get there, and that means getting through this, and healing yourself bit by bit.

Good luck. "
"&gt; By the way, if I were your boyfriend I would have broken up with you after six months of this BS. He is a saint for putting up with it for three years, he must really love you. Don't lose him because you are afraid of standing up to your parents.

Seconding this. It's honestly incredible that he's put up with *three years* of having to constantly sneak around and lie.

OP and her BF are at the point where they should be establishing their adult lives and planning out their futures, yet she can't even stay over at his house without them planning an elaborate ruse for the parents.

OP, if you keep prioritizing keeping the peace with your disrespectful, infantilizing parents, that's your call. But don't be surprised when your BF and the other adults in your life get tired of the bullshit, and leave you behind."
"Honestly the worst thing your parents can do in this situation is buy the car. Your brother is an entitled brat. Most kids never get a car off their parents, I am in my 30s and still have never purchased a brand new car.

However, I think you need to talk to your parents and say that you understand why they need to take this stance, but you feel it is unfair you are punished for your brothers bad attitude and ask if they would be open to still buying you half a car, with you purchasing the other half.

"You met him at 22-23, I'm not sure what kind of super dark past you could have had at that age, what could you could have done that's a lifelong disqualification from any relationship except with someone ""extremely difficult and very complicated."" Were you murdering people or molesting kids or deliberately killing civilians in a war or engaged in terrorist activities or did a school shooting? Or instead were you doing very common teen / young woman stuff like experimenting with drugs or maybe shoplifting or some sex work? Or were you actually the victim, the one that the dark stuff happened to? Maybe suffering from depression or eating disorder or self harm or something like that?

Honestly even if he accepts your oh-so-dark past, even that might be making it harder to move on from it in a way. Like oh your past is so dark and so bad, I'm the only one who will accept you. But another person might not even think your past is that dark or a very big deal. Especially since you've grown and presumably repented from whatever you had to repent for, moved on. I don't think you have to keep wearing whatever happened in your adolescence like some birthmark that disqualifies you from moving on to healthy relationships as a grownup.

I sort of get the sense that you are really attached to him because you feel like, ""he's damaged, and I'm damaged too, so we have to stick together, I won't give up on him because I don't want him to give up on me.""

But what if you are actually not damaged? What if it's okay for you to be with someone who is fully functional?

I don't think you have to keep punishing yourself for whatever happened in your adolescence and childhood by restricting yourself to dysfunctional relationships and people. If you feel like you have any atonement to make, make it and then move on."
"Run. Run far away.  That is some straight up psycho shit and so far into not-okay I don't know why you are even bothering to try and puzzle it out.

You admitted you cheated on her with her hot sister not once, but twice. THIS GUY DOESNT DESERVE YOUR SYMPATHY EVERYONE.

This is my new favorite answer to anything. 
"""She says that if we have cats, she can have pets too."" &lt;Ummmmm no
She is fully taking advantage of this situation. She does not get to make rules when she is a guest who has not held up her end of the deal (find a job). I would have been done the moment I realized she hadn't taken care of the cats. 
Your partner has to be the one to confront her. But this behavior is gross and unfair to you. "
I hate that line about “it happened a long time ago.”  People were trotting that out about the civil rights movement when it was only the 80’s. Those same sorts of people sure don’t feel like 9/11 was a long time ago.  
"&gt;  I didnt think much of it, until how he kept describing her, its obvious shes got a massive crush on him.

I suspect the reverse is true, likely mutual. At minimum, this sounds like an emotional affair. 

You are 6 months into the relationship and should still be in the honeymoon phase yet he's pretty much dating his coworker right under your nose. :/  You deserve a better partner.
"
"God, yes. He is an asshole usually when he drinks, which is rare. People alienate him because of this. And he doesn't understand. 

I tried to explain that a lot of men are offended or do not want to ""play"" like that, but his understanding is that ""they should just know"" and ""that's how guys are""....like dude, they are not 12 years old, a grown man does not want to be wrestled with or played with. He really doesn't grasp it. That is how the conversation came up like, for some reason he believes that since he is stronger and smarter than a lot of people he should be ""higher""....I can't even wrap my mind around it. He thinks that no one should ask him to stop fucking with them because they should just fight back. It doesn't happen a lot because he rarely drinks but when he does he usually does shit like that. "
"As soon as the kid is old enough to understand, she will probably be horrifically traumatized.

OP, the man you are married to is not a good man.  This is beyond the pale.  I consider myself a forgiving person, and have tried to reconcile the unreconcilable before.  If I were in your shoes, I would RUN, not walk, to a divorce attorney, and then a therapist for your kid.  None of this is okay.  None of this is worth redeeming.  Your kid's mental health is not worth sacrificing for whatever you still see in your husband."

This guy has been in this position for *years.* Administration knows what's going on. Someone last year even had assault charges against the man! No one will do anything because he's very good at getting companies to pay the university tons of money. 
"&gt;  You've been living for a long time repressing your feelings, 

I don't think OP has really grasped how damaging this is to her. She's basically killing her identity for this guy.

 Her entire relationship has been wringing water from a stone so of course she thinks it's soooo incredible when her bf lets her sleep over. THAT'S NOT AN ACCOMPLISHMENT that's like the BARE MINIMUM! 

Stop trying to be the ""cool girlfriend"" who bends over backwards trying to fix him, and start thinking about what you need. You said you gave up on the idea of having kids etc because of him? Stop! You are important.

Here's an idea, get a piece of paper and write out what you want from a relationship. Cohabitation, meeting family, marriage, how much time together, mental health of partner, etc."
"Woah this is straight up crazy town. He tracks your mileage and checks your underwear??!! While you may be right about him needing professional help and your marriage needing a new foundation - if he's disinterested what *can* you do? It will take both of you, but mostly him, to work on this very serious issue (this is no way for you to be living OP) but he can't even see/admit that he has gone way way way past normal behavior. The most you can do from the sounds of it is get a therapist for yourself - you need support."
"Yeah I don’t get this at all. I understand having a slight preference once you find out you’re pregnant, but really shouldn’t you just hope for happy healthy babies and a happy healthy mum? And in this case it sounds like there likely wouldn’t be a happy healthy mum so he should back off. "
"Honestly, this is going to sound harsh, OP, but...

I say if you want to deal with his abusive nature because you love him and are too scared of leaving him, then fine.  I think you would be wrong to stay with him, and that it's in your best interest to leave him immediately, but you are a grown woman and ultimately that is up to you. 

But if you have kids with this man, then this stops being about you and it starts being about vulnerable innocent children who have no say in how they are treated. So if you have children with him, that's when you become selfish and put your own well being above your future children's well being. Please please please, I am begging you to never have children with this man. It will be one of the most selfish decisions you will ever make if you do. Stay with him and deal with his abusive nature if that's what you want to do. I understand that people in abusive relationships have a difficult time leaving. But please, for god's sake, don't drag innocent kids into it. That's all I ask. :("
"Please be careful with the momentous you have of your ex. Don’t give your bf a chance to destroy them. 
Your story reminded me of a post on here where a woman threw out her husbands deceased wife’s momentous, that were meant for his daughter when she got older. Poor guy was crushed for his daughter. 
I know you didn’t have a family with your ex but i can imagine it would be traumatic to lose some last keepsakes of him. "
And how he thinks you two should live? Eating air?
"“Your babies miss you.” When he’s denied custody during the divorce, you can say the same."
"Just to add my 2 cents.

If your daughter were in this situation, what advice would you give to her?"

"&gt; She said he was the only guy she’d been seeing prior to finding out.

And she also didn't mention the pregnancy until she was about to pop.

Insist on a paternity test. "
"i think these two things are related. he thinks he should be allowed to act however he wants, because if he decides his intention was joking, everything should be excused or even appreciated, and if he were born royalty, that would be his life. he doesn't want power and prestige in order to accomplish great things, he named 3 brutal sadistic conquerers who did not value human life. wanting power in order to do  good is one thing, but he wants to be Joffrey. don't date a joffrey."
"As someone with social anxiety and is also extremely introverted, I would say what you're doing so far is fine. Make small talk with her whenever you can. Like over breakfast or meals. She would take a while to get comfortable with all of you so don't rush her and don't force her.

Try to engage her with activities that you would do as a family. Like go out together during the weekends or maybe watch some tv together in the evenings. Don't be offended or upset if she doesn't want to join. Give her as much time and space. She has to learn to approach you herself, but keep being welcoming to her and she will eventually."
"&gt; a dude that had 'no memory' of the incident would ask 'why is this jug flung across the room what happened'.

"He's fat, he's lazy, he doesn't want to work ever again, you don't have sex. 

What's he good for? Company? Girl, get tinder if you want some company, join a book club, don't tie yourself to Jabba the Hut forever "
"A few questions before I feel like anyone can give advice:

1. How long have you been together?
2. Has she always been like this? If not, then for how long?
3. Does she express affection in other ways?"
Her reaction to Op introducing herself would be pretty telling as well.
"As if that matters?

You've presumably decided to work on and maintain your marriage, yet you are still hanging out with someone who is trying to break you up. That's not respectful of the person you're supposed to be rekindling with.

Why did you separate in the first place? Did it have anything to do with your friend?"
"If she had middling grades she will need to do a lot of prep classes before applying, otherwise those applications are just money down the drain. Let her go talk to an advisor at the local community college because right now this just sounds scary.

It sounds like neither of you have done the research to know what steps are actually necessary. So let her go find out because it is all hypothetical until you both know the options.

Dont kill her dream for her, let her find out what it takes then approach logistics. Would she get a job? Where would she attend school? Would you both have to move? Figure this out first, because she wont even qualify for a loan until she gets into a school. (Which she wont do without prep courses that you cant afford yet)"
"I'd just proceed as normal.  Try not to put emphasis on the conversation or keep trying to figure out how she's feeling.  You could be seeing things that aren't there, but even still, just give it time.  Don't keep bringing it up and go back to being as normal as you can. "
"This dude is actively lying to you about basic maintenance to cover his lazy, immature ass. Do you really want to always wonder what else he's lying about to avoid having to admit he fucked up?

I'd confront him with the email you saw just for a well-earned ""fuck you"", but he's probably not going to exactly say ""oh yeah wow my bad"". He'll probably try to whine about you reading his emails, or switch the topic to an unrelated complaint about you. Let's be real.

If you want to give him one last chance, though, see what he says when he knows that you know.

If he tries to claim there was no email, or something else that just insults your intelligence at this point, I wouldn't even dignify that with a response.

&gt; It's gotten to the point that I have to make him a list of chores to ensure he actually helps around the house, and even then those chores often don't get done on the timeline I'd prefer. 

I'm so over grown men who expect their girlfriends to be their mommies. He should be embarrassed by this. I'm embarrassed for him.

&gt; and I have a hard time letting go of control over things like bills, etc. and to stop micromanaging him.

I don't see how you possibly could when he habitually fucks up his share of shit and it doesn't get fixed unless you micromanage it."

"I've heard of people who are into this as a sexual thing- there are 'daddies' and 'littles' who are women who basically pretend to be babies like your gf. However it seems like it isn't a sexual thing for your gf, in fact she's so inside this baby mindset that she feels having actual sex would be wrong. Not trying to shame her but you should ask if she's ever talked to a psychiatrist about this, because it seems like there might be trauma or something causing her to want to keep being a baby forever. "
"I think this would have been good to include in your OP. Do you and your husband have a budget? I mean an actual budget laid out to the dollar, not a general idea of one. I think you two should see a professional to have all of your income and expenses clearly laid out in front of you on paper. From there you two can make a solid savings plan and *both* compromise.

Where you're living at now clearly isn't working. Try having a strict budget that you both agree on for the next year. Maybe staying where you are will be feasible then. If not, then I think your husband should compromise on moving, or getting a new or second job."
Thank you. I'm just hoping that someone with a medical background can post something completely black and white so I can show him this post :D
"You don't owe her anything. You're already on the right path by ignoring her texts, and not speaking with her. Stay with it. "
"&gt; I also don't want to be the reason they're all homeless

You wouldn't be the reason. You've given your son a chance to get his shit together. I can understand you not wanting to kick him out (just yet) but his friends are another story. You owe them absolutely nothing. One day you will come home to find your home trashed. And the number of squatters might increase. Stop this crap now. You can give your son info on shelters and other resources if he's not going to work on getting his life together."

"People who have affairs are good at rationalising their own crappy behaviour and shifting the blame onto others. Often in their minds their spouses are at fault for them cheating. And if someone alerts the spouse, they are the ones who ruined the marriage, not the one who actually cheated. "
"If he approaches Google with an idea or device that is truly innovative, but for which he does not have a patent, one of two things will happen:

1. They will dismiss him out of hand, or 

2. They will like the idea, see that it is not patented, and will appropriate the idea and make money on it without him ever seeing a dime.

In the tech industry, there is precious little (it might be fair to say ""none at all"") of the concept of ""little guy with unprotected intellectual property gets a partnership with tech giant; makes millions"" actually happening.

If his ideas are not patentable, he won't make money off of approaching Google et al; if they *are* and he approaches them without patents, he'll have put the idea out there in a way that will likely prevent him from *getting* a patent, and he won't make money off of *anyone*, unless he makes and sells the device himself, and does so in competition with some pretty heavy hitters with massive resources.

In short, if his idea is worth something to a big player like Google, he needs to patent it *first*, a process that takes *years*.

There will be no jawbreakers today, none next week, and none in 2019, not from an idea that he has that is not yet patented."
No shit - I had to check the ages...
Can you say anything more about how that happened? Any advice on how to get through the part where I reject him? I don’t want to lose him or make him feel like he ruined our relationship.
"You ramp it back up. Had a baby, can confirm. You start slow. Start with regular touch that’s intimate but isn’t sex. Massage without the pressure of sex. Etc. Plan dates that end in the bedroom. Talk about sex again, get books, what do you want to try? Get nice new sheets, tidy the bedroom and make it welcoming for sex. 

Basically, try. "
"So this could go two ways. Sometimes people honestly don't know that they smell. I have a friend who constantly smells (her feet and her clothes, it's not pleasant) and she has no clue/doesn't recognize it. Do you shower every day? Use soap? Brush your teeth? Use deodorant? 

&amp;#x200B;

The other option is that this is just a her thing, especially if she can't touch fruits or vegetables without gloves, gets upset when strangers accidentally touch her, etc. I think some self reflection to make sure this isn't a you thing and having a serious conversation with her would be a good idea, but you should definitely be open to the idea that you could actually have BO and not realize it.  "
"""I believe you, and this is not your fault."" If you can tell her those things (in words and through action), that's a great start. 

In terms of justice, let her lead the way. This relationship was him controlling her, so you have to allow her to have control over the situation now. Ask what she wants to do and what she wants from you - let her know that you will be there to support her if she wants to report him to the school and/or police, but it is *her* decision to make. As appealing as justice sounds, if that isn't what she wants, let it go. Your main concern should be being there for her.

RAINN is a resource with a lot of good information on their website about reporting, counseling, etc. and they run a 24/7 National Sexual Assault Hotline that may be helpful to her or to you. I'm sorry you're both going through this. "
"If my husband was asking another woman what she wore to bed, asking her if she liked to cuddle, and calling her pet names, I don’t think one relationship would come back from that. Ever. "
"&gt;In order to protest not being able to stay with my family, she is choosing to ""ride out the storm"" alone with the dog and staying right I'm the path of the storm, by the beach.

YIKES. That's some next-level manipulation: ""You won't let me, a virtual stranger, stay in your home with an actual stranger and my large dog, therefore I will punish you by putting myself in harm's way.""

Your family made the right call. I'd lay money on her caving and just going to a hotel once she realizes they're serious about not letting her stay."
"You've been very accommodating to her insecurities.  You've offered to have her come to the lunch.  What the hell does she think is going on.  Sit her down and tell her you are not those guys that hurt her.  A good relationship has trust.  She doesn't have it for you.  So yeah this is becoming a deal breaker.  She needs to understand how serious her insecurities are and they are a threat to your relationship.  She either gets over them on her own or she gets some help to do so.  The blocking you on social media was really childish.  I wish you luck on this, if you don't address it now it will continue to be a problem going forward."
"I’m sorry, but the part I can’t really get past is how he threw a fit after telling you it was okay for you to miss his birthday, leading to you breaking up. He’s 28. I can see him being disappointed and pouting a bit because he realized he was going to miss you but the fact that he wanted you to cancel a work trip? That’s a red flag for me. 

Sleeping with your friend of ten years is another huge red flag. He had to know that this would hurt you far worse than sleeping with a stranger. And then when he came back, he hid it from you. 

Your friend doesn’t get a pass here. She’s shown her true colors. A one night hook up was more important to her than your feelings. Never forget that. Ten years of friendship weren’t enough to stop her. 

I’d really reassess whether you want to stay with your bf. He’s not behaving like someone who is ready to take a next step. Just take care. "
It means she wants to fuck other dudes but still have you to cuddle with and talk to. She wants to have her cake and eat it too. Time to say buh bye! 
"So many missteps here.  

1.  Asking your boyfriend for a threesome right after having sex with him is pretty rude.  ""Hey, so that lackluster performance reminds me, how would you feel about fucking other people?""  That conversation should have happened in a neutral environment when neither of you was feeling vulnerable.  Fuck up #1

2.  Expecting to be able to mention something like that - which fundamentally changes the nature and perception of your sex life, challenging the foundation your relationship was originally built on - is naive and a little bit selfish.  Almost as if you believed he'd either have the reaction you wanted, or he wasn't entitled to one at all.  Fuck up #2.

3.  You've been together 10 years, aren't married, don't live together, and you're asking him not just if bringing in more people is a good idea, but bringing in *SPECIFIC* people.  Which indicates to him that not only have you thought about it, but you've thought about it long and hard enough to land on your ""ideal"" starting point in terms of partners.  There's #3.

4.  Spicing up your relationship is a gradual process.  It would be EXCEEDINGLY difficult to jump from 10 years of monogamy straight to a more poly/swinger lifestyle with zero steps in between.  They require so much more pre-work, trust, after-care, vetting of the potential 3rd partners, and more.  You took a kid that only ever swam in backyard pools and threw him in a class 3 rapid expecting similar results.  Unwise.

5.  You pick a couple whom neither of you *really* know, and better yet, one that contains a party - the husband - whom neither of you like.  Why would you risk your relationship for a one-time fling with a couple you're not even compatible with?  What was the rush?  Were they leaving the country?  Was the invitation on some kind of action movie-style ticking clock?  That's such an unnecessary risk, and would indicate to me that the risk itself is worth more to you than the relationship.  Your boyfriend probably feels similarly.  She's willing to risk our entire relationship to have sex with them?  With him?  Why?  Because they both were going to be involved, right?  Doesn't seem like the wife was asking for one of them to join you, or vice versa.  So, what made THEM the candidates that precipitated this impulse? 

What to do from here?  Identify why you were ready to risk your relationship for this experience, and specifically, with this couple.  Was it because it was actually something you wanted to do or because you just felt like your relationship needed a jolt and this seemed like the best available option (spoiler alert: it's the second one).  

You still need to have a discussion about your sex life.  ""Normal"" might be what you think want since it's what you know - and is preferable to what is happening now - but it's clearly not sustainable given the events that led to you coming here.  So, you need to have that discussion again, being open, frank and honest about ALL of this shit and then try to move forward as a team.

Next, you need to apologize to your boyfriend and actually explain why you had or used to have this desire so that he understands where you're coming from.  As it stands, you're just hoping it will all go away instead of talking about it, so he has to fill in those blanks himself which is just going to make things worse given his current mental state.  You can't just want everything to go back to normal.  It took actions to ""break"" this thing, it will take equal and opposite action to ""fix"" it."
"This is right. OP is prepared to sacrifice so much for this man, but he refuses to do the minimum to participate as a partner in their relationship. 

OP doesn't hear the words ""I love you,"" she has reconciled herself to no marriage, no children, not living together, watching him disappear after ""intimate encounters"" because the intimacy or commitment is too much for him... what has he ever sacrificed for OP? 

The sad thing is, OP is sacrificing all of these things and more to try to make him comfortable, so that is now what he expects. People treat you how you let them treat you. OP, you deserve much better."
"Love this! “Not about sounding interesting, but about sounding interested.” This is so true. Asking questions and listening can lead to great conversation while taking heat off oneself. "
"Forgive yourself.

Dust yourself off, check for cuts and bruises, splash some ice cold water on your face and forgive yourself.

You gave someone the benefit of the doubt. Even if it wasn't a real person, that's a sweet thing to do. But sometimes it gets our hearts stomped on.  Sometimes it gets us killed. 

It wasn't all for nothing, because you learned something. Grieve all you need to, but then forgive yourself. You were catfished, and you're in good company. Many good people have been catfished. Maybe seek out a support group online?"
"To me, the shit-eating grin part sounds like he's just joking around about not remembering, and a more serious conversation or proposal might be coming your way.

"oh my god, I can't stop giggling. This is amazing. "
Not okay at all. She posted your picture TO MAKE FUN OF YOUR APPEARANCE ON A PUBLIC FORUM. To me that’s unforgivable and absolutely not a friend to you at all. I’m angry for you. It sucks when you find out people you thought were friends were indeed the opposite. The actively opposite. 
"I used to help out at a Sunday school class. When we were talking about the Commandments (specifically the one about adultery, which we defined as ""when you're married and kiss someone you're not married to""), this little girl raised her hand to give an example. We called on her, cuz even though adultery is an adult thing, we thought that surely a 6 year old will only say something like ""my grandma kisses her kids on the cheek."" Nope. She told us ""when my daddy is on business trips my mommy's boyfriend comes over and I go to bed early."" So yeah, kids can be bribed into secrecy."
"I’m sure he doesn’t just see you as a baby incubator. Kids are one of those deal-breakers, and if kids are a must for him, I understand why he’d want a clear answer from you on whether you want them too. If you don’t want them, then break up. Why continue a relationship that won’t go anywhere in the end? It’ll only be hurtful for you both in the long run. "
There's low blows and then there's that. I would go scorched earth too.
"Re: John being a coworker

The OP says that John is an intern while OP is a full time employee supervising a large project. I’ve always looked at internships as long term job applications. 

I understand being friendly or even friends with your colleagues, but there’s a power dynamic that Jane is clearly missing here, if she doesn’t see any issue speaking to OP like that. If Jane can’t get a grip on her actions, sooner or later, from one company or another, she is going to get John fired. "

"Don't waste your sympathy on this guy. He cheated on his ex twice with her sister: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6kz4ox/what_is_your_so_better_off_not_knowing/djpvqw3

"Have you considered the possibility that it's not your responsibility to protect her from her feelings?

One of the reasons that people get entitled attitudes like ""I should get an extravagant engagement ring even though we're not engaged"" is that other people, like you are doing, want to prevent a person from ever feeling upset, angry, or disappointed, and so they give in to whatever the person wants, or appease them in some way.

That teaches someone that no matter what they ask for, they'll *get* it, and *that* leads to right where your girlfriend is.

If you set the precedent now that you are not willing to allow her to feel the consequences of her own actions, the rest of the relationship will be nothing more or less than you subjugating yourself entirely in order to serve her every whim.

I'm a minister, and I've been performing weddings for a *long* time.  

This relationship is headed for disaster, and your *one* chance to save it from her entitlement is to *allow* her to be disappointed, upset, and angry that she didn't get what she wanted, and then (and this is the important part) to get *over* it.

If she can't do that, you will never have an adult relationship with her, you will have a period of indenture and nothing more."

"&gt;What more can I do to prevent Beth from interfering in my life?

Block Beth on ALL social media and get your brother and SIL to do the same. Start organising events through other means (emails, texts, phone calls) and don't invite your mother to them. She has proven she will go behind your back to invite Beth and will not back you up when you tell Beth to leave.

&gt;I missed a cousin's birthday, a cousin's wedding, and an informal ""family reunion"" in the last year.

That said, you absolutely should *not* be missing out on your family's special occasions because of Beth. Especially something as big as a family wedding (assuming you're close with your cousin and wouldn't have missed it otherwise). Going forward, do not skip family events. If Beth is there, ignore her. If she approaches you, say ""Beth, I do not want to talk to you. Leave me alone."" Say it loud enough that the people in your immediate vicinity can hear it. If she tries again, say ""I **said**, leave me alone.""  If she tries a third time, make a scene. Scream, ""I TOLD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE."" Repeat (at full volume) as many times as necessary until she either runs away, or someone else removes her. 

Beth is counting on you to be more reasonable than her. A reasonable person wouldn't crash a party where they know they are not wanted, and wouldn't refuse to leave. A reasonable person wouldn't stalk your family members as a way of getting close to someone who has ended a relationship. So Beth is counting on you to obey the standard rules of politeness and just let her bulldoze her way back into your life. Which is why you need to make a scene. Hopefully you'll scare Beth enough that she'll realise she can't just sneak her way back into your family or your life without *significant* push-back. Especially if you have a number of witnesses who observed her ignoring your No's more than once.

Hopefully your legal advice will be able to help you so it doesn't have to get to the above point. But if it does, do not be afraid to stand your ground. You are not being unreasonable by wanting this person, who is making a concerted effort to invade your life, as far away from you as possible."
"this is so exciting!! a few suggestions - if you're worried about being boring, ask questions, or just listen. if you are stressed about chiming in with thoughts, stray on the side of positive - e.g. compliments, optimism, comfort. You seem like a really sweet person so that shouldn't be too hard. You don't need to talk as much as everyone else if you don't want to - no one will think you're boring because of that, more likely they'll think you're a good listener. 

Also, when you feel more comfortable with them, consider opening up a little too. You can let them know you can get really anxious in social situations, so the fact they included you (as the new person) made you happy. Not everyone goes out of their way to do that, so letting them know appreciate that they did will likely make them feel good. I've advanced a lot of friendships just by opening up with how much I like the other person - not easy for me because being verbally affectionate makes me uncomfortable. People like the positive feedback (as I'm sure you can imagine).

Take the initiative to suggest hanging out too sometimes, instead of just tagging along. Have them over for dinner and games sometime or suggest a new restaurant to try. It's nice to know the effort is a two way street. 

Good luck! I know it's tough not to get stressed, over thinking your behavior, being worried about messing it up, but try to relax and enjoy! They sound lovely."
"This feels like a top response to me.

A lot of the other replies seem quite naive and idealistic - ""Yeh, you should tell him 'this' and 'this'!"". They're glossing over the fact that if this guy comes from money he, and his parents and their lawyers could make life very hard for OP.

I agree wholeheartedly that she shouldn't give up the position, this answer gives a good blueprint for *how* to go about it, and doesn't sugarcoat how hard it might be."
"&gt; hey you two fucked up, I am shocked at your behavior, I am not apologizing. Oh and by the way **your dead baby would be disappointed in how you acted**

If I said that bullshit to you you would haul back and punch me in the face, **and I would deserve it**.

Why the hell do you want to keep these people in your life???"
I missed my chance with the punch video sadly. However I will try to get screenshots of anything else nasty she posts. Not sure what I will do with them though.

"Honestly, here's what stood out the most to me:

When you flew home, hurt and heartbroken, he stayed to enjoy his vacation. He would have stayed and partied it up and enjoyed every minute of the joint vacation you planned had you not begged him to leave early.

He doesn't care about you. He certainly doesn't care about you more than he cares about himself.

If you marry him in 4 days I guarantee you more heartbreak. Save yourself the trouble."
"I’m sorry, I don’t want to judge you, but I can’t let this go unsaid.

If you were giving your pets every kind of flea treatment, you do realize that could kill them, right? Flea medication is literally poison. In proper doses, it’s enough to kill the fleas but not harm your pet. In high doses, it can make your pet very sick and they can die. 

I know you’re getting help from a psychiatrist, but if your mental condition is bad enough to harm your pets, please rehouse them. 

And, to your question, yes, your boyfriend saying “you don’t want to get diabetes, so you?” is incredibly manipulative. "
"I'd be very, very careful about a SO going to a strip club in a foreign country like Vietnam, Thailand. Those types of places are set up to end up being more than just stripping, they're more like prostitutes than anything. It's perfectly OK to not be OK with it and I would tell him you're 100% not on board with this and it may be a deal breaker. Let him decide how to proceed with that."
"Sex mutterings are one thing.......but that he's doing this during ordinary situations -  and not in a foreplay way, this...is concerning.

To me this feels like he's testing the water to see what he can get away with.  

&gt; he didn't mean to say it, and he really doesn't think of me that way, which I do believe.   
&gt;  
&gt; I know he thinks really highly of me so I don't know what give 

OP...you've only known this guy for 8 months.....8 months!  You don't know him.  But what you do know is that he's saying things that make you feel horrible about yourself, you have asked him to stop, and he makes excuses.....and *doesn't stop*.  Why are you willing to stay in a new relationship where your SO makes you feel bad about yourself?

"There’s a lot going on here, but the most important thing is your health and keeping your ED under control. It sounds like you’re really doing well in your recovery and have created a lifestyle that accommodates your needs. He's just thrown a monkey wrench into that with his behavior and that absolutely must stop.

First and foremost, does he know about your ED? If not, you need to tell him so he understands. If so, I would seriously reconsider dating someone who is being so obtuse about it. A cursory Google search would tell him that berating you over what you eat/food you keep in the house is a huge no-no for people with EDs.  Educate him further on this and remind him how serious it is: he needs a reality check on what this disorder is like if he is already aware that you have it. Don't settle for a partner that brushes this off like it's nothing. This is a serious thing you're dealing with.

Second, assuming he's not an obtuse douchecanoe, you are *super* active: Can you find something active to do together? You have a ton of activities and sports you do, which is great. You mentioned he doesn’t have as much time as he used to which is why he’s struggling with his weight, but I have to imagine that he has more time in his schedule than he thinks if you can work and do 4-5 significant activities and he does none. Hiking on weekends, for example? You need your lifestyles to mesh, and right now they’re conflicting. Work with him when you can: can you keep your junk food out of sight? What’s a feasible solution to support him while getting what you need? Is he willing to compromise?

On that note, if he can’t or won’t be collaborative I’d take a step back and see if you two are really compatible. Your ED means this isn’t a garden-variety “I’m on a diet and my spouse isn’t so there’s conflict regarding what we eat” issue, and he needs to understand that. Don’t let his issues harm your health or allow you to relapse.
"
"I don't think your boyfriend knows what nepotism is. Unless those industry heads are your parents, he's just wrong. 

And of course networking gets you jobs. Is he really 33 years old and he still doesn't understand that who you know is more important than what you know? 

Tell him that if he brings it up again you'll use your nepotism connections to find a new boyfriend."
"Yes. Your friend should know she’s dating a creep. 

I’m skeptical as to if she already knows though. Has she never seen his social media?"
"Black woman here (for what it's worth, not that it should matter).

Breakups are mad. You are still in a weird headspace as you are trying to rationalise her bigotry. You also seem to think the fault is with you ("" I can work on other shit"").

Everyone has said it but your girlfriend is a racist. You don't want to believe it because that would mean that you are/were in love with a racist but it's true. She's betrayed you, you should feel betrayed.

It is not uncommon in interracial relationships for 1 partner to fetishise the other's race or keep them around for sex/experimentation/status points/a tick off a list whilst not seeing them as good enough for anything deeper.

&amp;#x200B;

What you should do, you ask? Block her. I'm serious. Go no contact. Allow yourself to hurt, to feel betrayed but don't contact her. Distract yourself in healthy ways. Gym, personal projects, friends, whatever your poison is. Give yourself space to grieve in healthy ways as well. Cry, vent, watch and listen to sad stuff. Remind yourself that she was a bigot and it'll get easier with time. "
"The two examples you mention (car seat, toddler snacks) are actual safety concerns and anyone would step in to correct them. Straps have to be snug to be safe, and 3-month-olds should not be fed toddler food. 

Can you have a sit-down with your mom and your bf and lay out parameters for advice? He's probably feeling unsure of himself and doesn't like his deficiencies pointed out, but any safety issue must be pointed out. Maybe your mom and bf can agree that any non-safety issue won't be mentioned by her, and your bf can agree that he'll accept advice about safety issues."
"Honestly, a lot of it is on the rejected person's end. I was rejected by a friend I had romantic feelings for a couple years back, and I remember his response actually made me quite *happy* because it wasn't just ""I'm not interested."" He really went out of his way to impress upon me that he considered me a close and valuable friend, but it just was never going to be like that. I came out of the conversation like ""yeah, cool, I totally don't want to lose this friendship either,"" and we still talk with the same frequency and closeness we used to (which is obviously different from you and Noah, we were never best friends, but still). It probably helps that I have high self-esteem and low expectations, but yeah. I would say make sure he knows you value him as a friend, you're not simply thinking he's ""not good enough"" or ""not hot enough,"" which is ultimately what a lot of people fear when facing rejection."
"I think I got a headache while reading this.

Y’all are way too old for this shit. If Susie doesn’t like you, don’t hang out with her. Don’t invite her to things, avoid places where she’ll be, just don’t be around people that are unpleasant to be around. 

Your friend can manage her own relationships so no need to talk crap about Susie, just let her be. And stop trying to be friends with all of your best friend’s friends. It just won’t happen. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"&gt;  That is how the conversation came up like, for some reason he believes that since he is stronger and smarter than a lot of people he should be ""higher""

Yet he feels like he's a loser because he's a late bloomer? But at the same time, is upset that he didn't bloom into Napoleon or Julius Caesar?

He strikes me as one of those guys who thinks very highly of himself and has this ""I was born in the wrong century"" mentality, when in reality, he's insecure and aware that there are ""better"" more driven people than him that were offered LESS opportunities growing up than he was.   

That may be why he acts out like a 12 year old around other guys.  Perhaps he feels insecure around those who he feels should be ""below"" him because, while he says he wants to do great things, he's still trying to figure things out.  

It must be frustrating to think so highly of yourself but then try to rationalize why people you consider lesser than you seem to be doing better than you are.  

He sounds insufferable, to be honest.  And, at 33, if a dude my age tried to wrestle me (other than my brother because we're idiots together) I would wonder what the hell is wrong with him. 

&gt;I can't even wrap my mind around it.

That makes two of us.

"As a landlord, you need to be sure that you're following the law in this matter. Do you have a lease with him? Is there a clause on unlawful behavior that allows you to break it? You should post at /r/legaladvice to figure out the proper course of action for your locality."
"GET THE FUCK OUT. He WILL kill your dogs and he WILL hurt you. Get out. Call a domestic abuse hotline. Have the cops escort you somewhere safe. Do NOT tell him you’re leaving before you are already gone. Go back to your dad’s house. Get OUT. NOW. 

I want to scream this from the rooftops until you *promise* to leave and NEVER let this fucking psychopath near you or your dogs again. 

Your pride is NOT worth your life or your puppies’ lives. Your pride is keeping you in this relationship. Are you seriously more concerned with whether or not you might fight with your sister than watch your boyfriend murder your dogs? Your pride will get all of you killed.

Honestly I never say things like this but if he kills himself, there will be less evil in the world. 

GET OUT AND NEVER LOOK BACK

Edit: make sure the dogs get out with you and *he does not know*. If you say you’re leaving, I can see him very quickly threatening the dogs as a way to get you to stay, or outright killing them to punish you. Don’t fuck around with this."
"&gt;pretending to be her boyfriend so men don't hit on her

This does not read like he is pretending. I'm sorry. "
"&gt; immature as it is, it is difficult for me to swallow the idea of him taking the money I made him and pursuing our dream without me.

First, you need to stop thinking of your BF's money as ""money you made him"". It may have been an investment opportunity that he only accessed by virtue of knowing you, but that's very different from you *earning him* that money.

But that's a minor issue compared to the fact that your boyfriend clearly only cares about his own wants and needs in this relationship.

His decision process is entirely based on what *he* wants to do, where *he* wants to live, or what goals *he* wants to fulfill. You're basically just trying to hang on and survive while he follows his own whims and passions.

Is this someone you want to build a future with? Someone who not only constantly pushes you to live according to only *his* wants, but can't even come close to holding his end of the few promises/concessions he makes you (e.g. agreeing to wait a full year so you'd be ready to travel, but after only 6 months just saying he's going either way)?

&gt; Am I wrong for thinking he should wait for me? Am I wrong for feeling completely unsupported?

You're not wrong for thinking he should wait, and you definitely *are* completely unsupported here.

If he's going ""with or without you"", it needs to be without you."
"&gt; You want to own a home but you can't afford one because your husband wants to have the perfect life. Now, an option shows up that will allow you both to get what you want without making any lifestyle changes, but out of principle, your husband would rather things continue the way that they are, since he doesn't care about owning a house. 

Well, I need to take some responsibility here. My husband has been trying to get me to save money for awhile. The last three years or so is when my income got to a level where I *should* be able to save, but we haven't. And it's my fault. 

My Husband would live in the bushes and eat canned beans for all he cares. I like eating out, expensive alcohol, staying in nicer places on my yearly vacation*, and am not great at delayed gratification. If my Husband was 100% in charge of finances we'd probably have some money saved (not 100k though). 


*My husband gets to travel all over the world for his job. I take one vacation a year. My husband is fine with hostels and we always argue about this because I want to stay in nice boutique hotels. During our last trip to Thailand we compromised by doing the first half budget/backpacker and the second half luxury. I also brought my brother and his girlfriend and paid for most of their trip (my Dad bought their plan tickets though). It really bothered my husband we paid for them. He doesn't like when I give my little brother money and it's a strain in our relationship. He loves my little brother, but thinks I'm too generous. I was slipping my brother and his girlfriend extra cash in Thailand and when I told him about it he was furious (because I did it behind his back).    

I view it totally different and think family helps out family. Since his family has never helped him out we have different perspectives. 
"
"Well, you don’t really have to explain anything to them. It’s your money and your life. 

I think the best thing you could do is say a sentence that makes them feel uncomfortable. 

“Why do we keep talking about my finances now that you guys know that I have money? Do you feel differently about me?” 

“Why do you keep trying to convince me to buy stuff? I know I can do that.”

If you phrase these as questions, it will be awkwardly silent for a few seconds while you wait for them to answer. It should though. They need to know that there is a point when inviting themselves into your finances is inappropriate. "
"He's not required to feel happy about your cats coming. He's allowed to be quietly upset, which is what he tried to do. You forced him to tell you that he was upset. You should have left him alone—he was trying to be polite.

You're not in the wrong. Neither is he. It's a bummer that your country is unstable, it's a bummer that he may have to move. Life's not perfect. You don't owe him anything. Let him be mad. "
Your friend sounds lovely and mature. You sound horrible and self absorbed. I'm Jewish and the act of having your wedding at a plantation is the same as having one in a concentration camp. I wouldn't attend your wedding either and I would cut you out of my life entirely. 
"It sounds to me that either:

A: She's trying to avoid going to lunch with co-workers. Is she tight on money or trying to lose weight before the wedding? Maybe she doesn't want to hurt her co-worker's feelings by saying she doesn't want to go eat with them.

B: She's trying to show you off.

C: She misses you so much and this is the only time in her day she knows that she has time to chat for a minute."
"&gt;  yeahhhh but we basically have to treat Ashley like she has had a delayed start at life. on her new hormones, she has to relearn how to be a human while her body has to relearn everything controlled by hormones, which is everything from what time she poops to who she crushes on, so I'm not surprised she's going extra nuts.

Uh no, we don't. And just so you know, it's extremely misogynist to say that female hormones cause women and girls to be ""nuts.""

I went through puberty and wasn't ""nuts"" in any way, shape or form. I was just a normal girl and all my friends were normal girls. There was nothing nuts, erratic, or out of control about any single one of us. We were good students, had normal activities, friends and interactions. We were also bullied from morning to night every single day by bullies in our age group. And that's what Ashley is. A bully. And Ashley needs to be punished like any bully needs to be punished

We don't ""need to"" give a pass to an 18 year old adult who is viciously bullying and abusing their sister who is still a minor. ""Transgender puberty"" doesn't make anyone a bully and abuser and it's transphobic to say that it does. We don't give passes to teens who are bullies because everyone goes through puberty but most people don't become bullies during puberty. We certainly shouldn't give passes to adults bullying kids.

"One, give them a hard deadline for leaving and check to see if you need to legally evict them (maybe check r/legaladvice). 

Two, contact CPS about the child, let them know what you have seen / experienced and what the situation is and let them handle it from there.

He ABSOLUTELY shouldn’t be in any position of authority. This isn’t “slightly vindictive,” OP. Your friend is a certified asshole. 

Please, please don’t question your fitness for the role. If you served well as Vice President, you’ll do fine as President. Your friend’s loss was entirely self-inflicted and you do not owe it to him to save him from the *thoroughly* deserved consequences of his actions. That’s how monsters are created. 

I get the distinct impression that this guy collects people who feel indebted to him for this very reason. If his parents are in the habit of buying him out of trouble, he’s learned to do the same, except with favors in place of money. Don’t fall for it. "
"Oh lord. Girl let me tell you about my ex, cause I'm getting flashbacks. 

When we were breaking up, he told me that I was ""bad luck"" and everything im his life went wrong since he got with me. 

He left a job he ""liked"" (told me he hated it at the time) and got one he didn't like. Got fired from that job (for calling in sick 18 times in the first 2 months), got fired from the next three jobs (for about the same reason, and hid the last one from me by pretending to go to work every day for 2 weeks and instead going to his friends to play video games). He got a loan for a car he didn't need (his car worked fine he just wanted a sportier model) and drove the car away from the guy promising to mail a cheque when the loan came through. Of course it didnt end up being approved and instead of dealing with it he just ignored the guys calls untill the guy broke into his flat and tried to steal my exes and his roommates stuff to get his money back. His car he actually owned got clamped because he hadn't paid his tax in 6 months. He couldn't pay his rent because he had spent all his money on partying (so I had to help him out). What should have been the final straw was when I borrowed about £300 from his parents and 2 months later put the money in his hand to give back to them. He used the money for his rent, lied to them and said I hadn't given it back for 6 months (and lied to me saying he had told them I'd paid it back) until they started threatening me with sending someone round to get their money back and I managed to get his mum on the ohone and told her the truth. 

There was more, but I'm getting mad just typing it out so I will stop there. You get the idea. Every piece of ""bad luck"" was a result of him making shitty decisions, and I was always the one advising him against them, and bailing him out when things went wrong. So for him to tell me that I was bad luck, I was the reason his life was going wrong, was such a gut punch I actually felt physically sick. 

Don't be with anyone who cannot own responsibility for their own mistakes and failures. Certainly don't be with anyone who would blame you for things you have no control over. This is a pretty severe character flaw and I hope you see it to be the giant waving red flag that it is. 

Edit: clarity "
"Cellist here. This ^

If she had pulled this shit around me I'd have hit out the aforementioned ""can you fucking not"". It's insanely annoying and comes off as extremely arrogant. 

I'd have a word with her. Surprised no one has shut this shit down yet."
"My daughter was like that until she hit 12. We made a rule that you had to have at least a bathrobe on in public areas. If she wanted to hang out in her undies she needed to stay in her room. It was making her older brother uncomfortable, so it was a fair compromise and she got some cute robes out of it. 

The time that we have where we are just comfortable in our own skin is so short. Once women especially hit puberty and their teens it becomes harder.  I’d suggest just ignoring it. You’re not her parent. At your home you can make whatever rules you want. But you should be happy knowing she’s comfortable with you to just be herself.  "
“Mostly joking” That’s like being a little bit pregnant.
"Imo that's the bad part. There messages meh. If he's literally never responding or calling back then she may just be some weirdo from the past. I've had people i ignored for months too.

He could still be doing something bad and it should be investigated. But the first concern here should be wtf he's doing at 1am lol. Idk why op just accepted that"
"Sheesh this is a mess. First, I’d like to ask, why don’t you want a divorce? I’m having a hard time seeing any compelling reason to continue living this relatively miserable existence. I’m sure your answer is a long the lines of “I still love her deeply” or “we had 10 year together that were wonderful, surely we can get back to that”. Before you tell me why you want to stay, allow me to present a few points:

- the staggering immaturity displayed by her is truly amazing. She asked for a divorce because she “wanted you to fight it/fight for her”. That’s so high school/college dating crap. You know the type: tells her boyfriend she’s fine, he accepts it, then she gets pissed at him for not forcing her to talk/ she breaks up with guy over trivial reason, he accepts it, she gets mad he didn’t fight for the relationship. Point being, it’s all a test. And something a woman her age should not being doing to a long term partner, out of what I believe is complacency and boredom in your marriage.

- she has actively avoided you and ignored you while living in the same house, and sounds like she avoided your daughter too. If for no other reason then giving your daughter a healthy upbringing where she’s not actively living in the same house as a emotionally neglectful mother, you should want to get out. 

- you can’t save her or make her suddenly not be lost in life. Deciding to not get divorced won’t help her find herself. In fact, getting divorced and having a chance to explore who she is and life could be best for her. 

- she had at least one emotional affair on you. That should bother you considerably more. It’s not like she doesn’t have love to give, she just has no desire to give it to you. By all accounts, it sounds like she wasn’t terribly engaged in couples therapy, which means what issues do exist, she has no desire to change. This won’t change if you decide not to divorce. 

As to how to navigate this when you talk, ask her why she felt the need to file for divorce if she didn’t want one. If she says she wanted you to fight for her, tell her it is ridiculous and immature to “test” you after 10 years of marriage. By all accounts you did the mature thing. You accepted it as what she wanted, and wanted what she wanted. There’s no excuse for her actions. Personally, if it were me, I’d deeply ponder the points above and consider what you really need. I would likely come to the conclusion that divorce is for the best, and tell her as much. "
"I say this with love: it's super sad that your ""high point"" in marriage is that you're at a more reasonable wait and things aren't as volatile as they could be.

Just go. Your friends and family obviously love you and care about you. Leave this man and head back to rebuild your life with your support system. 

I get that it's hard to convince yourself that's appropriate; sunk-cost fallacy and all. But you've listed literally NOTHING positive about this relationship or your life. And it's only going to get worse from here as you're more isolated and stagnant in your career, with a husband who clearly doesn't have your back.   


Get out. Do-over. It sucks, but girl, you're only 25. Don't let this be the rest of your life. "
"This woman is obviously very immature  and IMO, not anywhere near ready for marriage. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. You have been assigned to work with the guy. It is unfortunate that she can't deal with him having association with any other females. I would not interact with her at this point. Keep it professional and friendly with John at work."
"Divorce and live separately.

You don’t have to break up, just explain that your moral philosophy means you can’t work to provide for another.  You respect his moral stance too much to ask him to change.

His moral philosophy is bullshit.  He’s just a lazy mooch.

The longer you support him, the longer you’ll be paying alimony.  Sure society and therefore the courts are corrupt and if he’s true to his philosophy he won’t take a penny from you, but he’ll do it anyway."
"They love you a lot because you do as they ask. Wait till you start doing your own thing and you'll realize how their love is conditional on you giving into their control.

Fight for your right to have a life. If they truly love you then they'll come around. And if they don't? Then they don't love you for you. They love this idea of an extention of them. "
"The ""I [heart] you"" card and the kiss on the lip is as obvious as it's going to get. If that doesn't count as a bill-board like sign, I don't know what you're looking for. She straight up told you she has feelings for you and basically asked you out. Take a hint, call her now and ask her out. "
In all seriousness if my loved one locked themselves in the bathroom after a tragedy I’d be scared for their wellbeing too.
The thought crossed my mind.
"Don’t tell him about your bulimia or any other info about your private life.   You have no obligation to JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain) your life choices outside of the scope of his class. 

If he hassles you about how you spend time outside of the 12-20 agreed upon hours, your only answer (repeated if necessary) is “I’m fulfilling the requirement of this class as agreed”. Anything else is none of his goddamned business. "

My mother is not a good mom, at least not to me. She also likes to think and act like she's a 20 something without a care in the world. Beth goes out regularly, not in a ""white girl wasted"" way, but probably goes out for a drink or two a few times a week. There are only a few places to drink where we live, so they're often running into one another.

I've stopped going to family events simply because I know Beth might be there. I missed a cousin's birthday, a cousin's wedding, and an informal ""family reunion"" in the last year. I think my mother is incapable of understanding that Beth said these things and meant them. It's not like she said things about me, in a moment of anger or something and then apologized.

I think my sister-in-law was more in shock of what was happening so that she didn't even know what to say. They also subscribe to the ""your family, your responsibility"". It was over in a few minutes and my brother did speak up."
This is probably the best way to handle it. Your gf is allowed to feel the way she feels. Many people ITT are invalidating your gfs feelings. Yes burlesque is an art form but it also involves nudity and its okay for your gf to be uncomfortable with you watching your friend partially nude.  You are also not a shitty friend for not going -- when we get in serious relationships theres some things we dont do anymore out of respect for our relationship. 
"Money brings out the worst in people. In my opinion your wife is being unreasonable. It's your parents' money to bequeath as they please and the division seems fair to me. She should be grateful you're getting anything. 400K is nothing to sneeze at.

Maybe you two should go work this through with a couples counselor for a few sessions, clear the air and not involve your parents in this. "
"People who defend the rich and get nothing out of it are called suckers. 

You and your friends are fine, there's no reason to change any of that. All you can do is explain to bf is that this isn't like doing something like using a disabled parking space (a finite resource allocated to a certain group) but it's really completely harmless (an infinite resource the companies themselves agree on the price/benefit of) - The companies literally do not give a shit because bottom line they are still getting $$$"
"I know you don't think that is was, and I may be totally off base here, but when I look at the facts it seems like unrequited love from a disturbed person.

First, they talked all the time.  There was certainly an emotional attachment of some type - at least platonic.  His denials of interest in her seem over the top.  Disgust?  That's hard to buy from a guy that was such a good friend.  He traveled with you while you were married several times.  He never had a girlfriend - rather he gave his emotional support to your wife (and you) and received the same from her.  He probably was, in some ways, emotionally dependent on your wife.  

So when your child came along it was the final straw.  He realized he wouldn't be her number one priority.  He realized (if he was hiding his interest in her) that he never stood a chance.  In part, because he taking the medication and in part because it was probably part of therapy for him.  

He has expressed his displeasure with their friendship and said it has been for a number of years.  I have to wonder if those years correspond to your marriage and if the displeasure was in fact due to your relationship with your wife.

I can't know, but I wonder if the ""O"" part of his OCD was partially directed at your wife.  

I hope I am wrong.  I likely am.  But consider this possibility and it would explain much of his behavior and what he has said."
"Never, ever validate your mom's bias.   Do not agree to go along with even subtle discrimination just because it's easier and call her out on anything blatant.

You need to realize that your whole life experience has been different from your sister.  It's not just the way she has been disfavored by your mom, it was prevalent in Ghana and it's still happening where you are today.   You have been privileged by your lighter complexion just by being.

If your father was French, you and your sister might want to consider spending time with relatives there and experiencing a new place free from your mother's baggage."
"This 100%. Women aren't like porn, he can't sort by race/ethnicity and try each one out at his leisure like they're novelties, then go back to OP when hes done. Fuck this dude. I hope these models hes so infatuated with see through his bullshit too"
"Wow, your stepfather sounds like an incredible man. If he's still around, give him a hug."
"My guess is there's a looooot more she's lying about/hiding. 

It may be time to move on. You won't ever be able to trust her."
"&gt;  Am I being used emotionally?

No, you've only seen each other five times and she's still working up to being comfortable with having sex with you.

(for real, why does this never occur to people?)"
"That's what I was thinking about doing, but I don't want him to get his feelings hurt thinking I'm trying to mother him. But that would be the best option. Fix up his car and see how long he can keep it like that."
"&gt;And that any colleague who would judge her is incredibly narrow minded and shouldn't be paid any attention to?

Actually, no, I can easily imagine it looking very strange for someone in the field of African American studies to be seen smiling and partying with non-black people at a plantation.

If these are her convictions about plantations and she’s expressed them before, and then pictures came out that contradicted those statements, she’d look like a hypocrite to everyone she’d ever discussed the subject with."
"I wish you could hear me chanting “dump his ass” from my apartment. He’s abusive. Yes, that may seem like a huge claim to make based off of little information, but there’s no way to spin this that isn’t abusive."
"Put a recording app on your phone, then run it so you have a record. I’m sorry your mother is being so selfish. "
"That’s because he keeps getting older and they stay the same age. 

He’s probably too immature for woman his own age. "
"Tell him to get over himself. People don't want to hear about the low level stuff about your job when you meet them, the high level exciting broad picture is what they're after. He's being immature and not supportive. Maybe he should figure out a way to describe his job that makes it sound exciting. Does he like his job? Is he happy with the work he does?"
"I second this. He HAS to come with you. So he can inconvenienced like you are. My husband has done something similar but with not so drastic of a result. Guys, emirite?"
"As I see it, there are two possible scenarios here:

\-He is into her, his comments about ""hating her"" are an attempt at deflection, and he was flirting.

\-He genuinely doesn't like her, and his comment was an attempt to deliberately intimidate her or make her uncomfortable.

Neither of those options is a good look."
"&gt; I feel like she feels guilty about being irresponsible and is trying to blame me so that she doesn’t have to blame herself.

That's exactly what she is doing.   Do not engage her.  Tell your brother that he needs to talk her down and give them some space for a little bit."
"This. It doesn’t seem like anything is going on, other than this girl needs to learn to keep most of her minutiae to herself. Even if he were single - damn that’s a lot of messages to one person. "
"She knows he has a girlfriend, because I stop in at his work occasionally to bring him Starbucks or whatever, and I'll hang out at the restaurant bar chatting with his bartender coworker whos really plesant, so she walks by me repeatedly. No way she doesn't know who I am. "
"I gave birth to twins unexpectedly at 25 weeks, 0 days myself and felt exactly how your wife feels. Still do sometimes. The blame is so intense and watching your child in the NICU only makes it worse.

The best thing my husband did for more was helping me see all the ways in which my body could be useful to our sons. Is she breast pumping? Is she able to do skin-to-skin yet? Has she started reading to your little one so she knows her voice and feels safe?

Physical intimacy also helped me reclaim my body in many ways, to help me feel loved and valued but also to give my husband the opportunity to praise me in ways solely his own.

Has she made friends with any of the NICU nurses, respiratory therapist, or parents yet? Most NICUs run support groups that are immensely helpful in feeling less alone. Talk to the parent coordinator because they usually have phone and email contacts for graduated parents as well.

You also didn't mention family and friend support. It is hard to see how good your child is doing when you see them every day. We used an app called Tinybeans to post daily updates for friends and family. Seeing their encouraging comments about what strong parents we are and being able to look back over time and highlight milestones really helped. It also gave me something productive to do as I sat beside their incubators.

Also, still have a baby shower if you were planning to. Your wife did very hard work in bringing your daughter into the world and should be celebrated for it. 

Sorry for the ramble, but this hits very close to home. My one son didn't make it but my other is 5 months corrected now, home and thriving. Sending love and encouragement your way."
"as someone who grew up very religious... this is some bullshit. only hard-core misogynist factions of Christianity believe this shit. what else does he not want you to do because of his ""religion""?"
"Have you read the article ""The Life and Death of Jessie James"" (LA Times)? The story is remarkably similar.

I wouldn't bother sending it to him, though. He's already made up his mind and is 100 percent committed to this illusion, and the more you try to wrestle him away from it, the harder it will be to reestablish your friendship once this whole thing crashes and burns. And it will. Hopefully before he empties his bank account to pay for her fake cancer treatment."
He’s not even trying to do anything with his life. He’s not a kid anymore and neither are his homeless friends. Don’t enable him. 
Yeah it's bullshit. Not fair
"It doesn't seem like your friend really cares all *that* much, to be honest. You're coming up with excuses and since she believes them, she's trying to be helpful. She's not putting pressure on you to show up or anything, so I'm not sure why you feel shitty?


Regardless, just be honest. ""Hey, it's awesome you enjoy it but it's not really my thing, thanks for the offer!""


Burlesque isn't everyone's cup of tea even if they're single. I'm sure your friend will understand. "
She's not having a midlife crisis she's in the throes of an active addiction and needs help. It's normalized for you because it progressed slowly but you need to take a step back and realize how fucked up this is. 
I can not get over the fact that your husband asked YOU to save money for the both of you. While he lives on his expensive dream Island off of your money. 
"Right, or for the grocery store, they've just guaranteed that 5 people are coming almost exclusively to their store, rather than the one across the street.  In all honesty, these guys are probably better for the store, since a family plan with 3 kids only has 2 shoppers while this group has 5."
"This needs to be sent to all those friends. Simple.

“If you honestly think because I hung out with a friend on two occasions that I am cheating on my husband, then Im questioning our friendship and trust.”

That is absurd. I would leave, chances are this will only get worse. If they don’t believe you now even with your husbands support, then I doubt anything else would change their minds."
"&gt; I personally don't want to cut them out of my life completely

You might find yourself more comfortable with this notion as time goes on. 

Last year, I cut contact with my dad after he crossed a boundary I could not forgive. I thought it would only be for a few months before we resumed contact (albeit on my terms), but then, like you, I re-evaluated our history with new eyes. As more and more months passed, I felt more comfortable with the idea of us never talking again. I can easily imagine future milestones (weddings, children, etc) without him, and I no longer feel guilty for that. 

Give yourself time. Take each day one at a time - some will be easier than others. Focus on the relationships that make you feel good (your wife, supportive friends). 

I'm incredibly sorry for your loss, and for your mother's inexcusable comments. "
This.  Alone in a relationship is TERRIBLE.  Alone by yourself is manageable.

"I had a similar relationship with my mom when I was a kid- everything had to be her way (which towel to use rings sooo true. I can't tell you how many times I got yelled at because I didn't know one towel was supposed to be used vs another- and it changed all the time), her nap time and phone time with her sisters or friends was always after school hours, so we did not play, she just told me what to do. Things have gotten better as I've gotten older.

One thing we did that I thought might be a good idea with your kids would have a ""date"" with mom once every other week. It would just her and me- we'd go to a children's museum, the zoo, a movie, etc. Just her and me, no one else. It was something I eventually looked forward to."
"At my local grocery store, the cashiers have a discount card they can swipe if a customer has forgotten theirs. "
"&gt; Your boyfriend sounds a little /r/iamverysmart

Fully agree. He sounds like the kind of person who claims their feelings are “all based on logic”, to somehow make their feelings more “valid” then their partner’s feelings.

I mean, even given his assumption that “the brain finishing development around 24yo” means “you can’t fully understand love until 24yo” (already a huge logical leap)...that still means OP, who’s over 23yo, is 96+% of the way there, right? That’s more than enough understanding to “validate” her feelings of love.

The “Vulcan logic” is a dumb smokescreen, for the fact that he’s not ready to say it back. Which in itself is *fine*, if that’s how he feels. It’s the weird masking of his feelings as “logical”, and subsequent patronization of OP’s feelings, that’s gross."
You need to speak to someone. Your normal meter is broken. Your parents are terrible people.
"If you're still thinking about him on the day to day you might not be ready for dating. It's impossible to know exactly what you're going through but it sounds like you're dealing with loss hard and you're having trouble moving on. If you haven't yet try seeking some kind of therapy or potentially diagnosis for medication. I know that might sound extreme but 7 months is a long time.      
 That said it sounds like you're making progress and that's great! Just remember that you have friends who care about you more than ""the one"" and it sounds like they got your back. Posting this shows you want to move on. So just give it time and a little work and you'll be ready to find someone really worth it.

Edit: other people are noting 7 months is not that long and that's definitely fair. The older you get the less that time will really mean. Don't focus on if you're taking ""too long"". The exact time for  someone to recover is as much as they need."
She's blaming you so that she doesn't have to blame him. It's childish and sad. You don't need someone like that as a friend. 
"Your dad sounds abusive. That's a separate issue from what I'm about to say, but I hope it helps you see things from his perspective. 

You mentioned your dad was a caretaker to your mom while she was sick. That signals to me that he ""lost"" his wife maybe months or years before she actually passed away. His time to grieve happened during her illness, most likely. 

Your relationship with your mom never changed. When she was sick she was still mom. 

All that said, he's clearly never been responsive or empathetic to your needs so it feels like all of this trying to build some empathy for your dad is a moot point but it might be a helpful angle to talk more about in therapy. In fact, given all his abusive behaviour I would encourage you continue the low to no contact thing you've been doing. 

I'm so sorry you went through this. "
If she's addicted to party drugs and staying up all night it's probably coke. 
"Yeah, to me, this could be a sign that there's not much to this relationship aside from sex, especially because a) there are other things you can do besides PIV and b) it was only two months. My husband had a fairly invasive surgery a couple years ago and though we couldn't have sex for a while (the poor guy was a mess for a couple months), we were intimate in other ways (emotionally as well as physically). I was also diagnosed with a chronic pain condition about a year ago so for a while I was in too much pain to have sex but we found other ways to stay close (there were some things I could still do) until I got it all under control. We were pretty creative at times, so I wonder why OP and his SO didn't think to switch it up. Not to mention that during all these periods we were talking and connecting emotionally, he never felt like a roommate or some dude I ""ran into"" in my my house, so those are kind of red flags for me.

Maybe the thing to do here is not rush back into sex but try to work on figuring out why you haven't been connecting emotionally and start there."
Someone in the previous thread called it.
And you know that he wouldn't be watching his kid. He would ignore the kid and other people would feel bad for the kid and entertain him.
"It would absolutely fall on OP and Melissa to take care of the kid the whole trip while Arthur gets drunk with the guys because they're women and that's what they do, right?  "
"I told him already but yeah, maybe hearing it from multiple people will get it through to him."
"&gt; he felt like he could stare at other girls because I didn't have a job so he had the right to do it.

What?!?

Between that, his stance on you spending money, and him getting upset when you want to talk about things, I don’t think he sees you as an equal partner. You say things are better but how can they be if you still feel shitty and he won’t acknowledge it?

He needs to agree to work on making you feel better or you need to get out."
"You need to cut your losses. This is not going to end well for you, speaking from experience from [his] perspective.

Once you develop one-sided feelings in a fwb relationship, it is over. There is no saving anything."
"This is probably going to be unpopular but here goes.... the vast majority of attorneys (myself included) do not become attorneys just because they want to ""help people"".  We are not all Mike Ross.  Being an attorney is a hard career with long hours but it provides a certain standard of living - its well paid profession and provides the ability for material thing that some people value highly.  It is demanding and difficult and is rewarding financially.  This is Person A.


Being a teacher is not that kind of profession - it is more of a vocation.  It takes a certain kind of person to want to do the job which has its own hardships for very little financial reward but it is emotionally rewarding for those who want to teach and help their students.  This is Person B

Person A views money as an indication of success and personal value and Person B views the extent they have helped someone as a success indicator and gives them personal satisfaction.  Neither one is wrong, they're just different.

Relationships between these two people can succeed if Person A is willing to take the financial strain of the relationship and values his partners happiness over their ability to contribute equally financially.

OP your husband is not one of those people.  You already knew this when he pitched a fit over you changing from medicine (which is a time consuming but financially rewarding career - similar to law but also with a vocational element) for teaching (which is lower hours, lower pay and more vocational).  He cannot understand why you would choose to change as it doesn't line up with his values.

People may disagree with me but it is not *wrong* for OP husband to value things in this way and to want a partner who is on an equal footing financially so they can live the expensive lifestyle he wants.  To him that is the whole *point* of becoming a lawyer.  It is, however, unfair for him to have married OP if he knew he would never be satisfied with her career choice and earning abilities.  Equally, OP he was *very clear* about not taking the financial strain of the relationship due to you switching careers when you signed the prenup, so I am unsure as to why you are so surprised this has come to a head?  He *was* perfectly happy when you were paying your equal way as, in his mind, that was your arrangement when you got married - he told you as much, clearly.  And now - in his opinion *you* have gone back on the agreement you made.  You said yourself that things were fine while you split the bills 50/50.

You absolutely should *not* work a job that you do not want to work in and you should take a job that fulfills you, however you have to accept that he doesn't want to take the lions share of the financial responsibility for your marriage when he wants a certain lifestyle.  IMO you two are never going to resolve this issue.  You have incompatible views on finances which you never seem to have addressed.

You see a marriage as being an equal partnership so that you each support the other and pick up each others slack - financially, emotionally etc.  He sees marriage as an equal partnership with both partners bringing the same *financial* contribution to the table.  You should not have to spend all your money on a lifestyle you cannot afford and he should not have to live a cheaper"" lifestyle to be more inline with your financial resources.  Neither compromise is suitable to you guys. 

Again I don't think that either of you are wrong but you are incompatible and should have addressed this before you married when it came up during prenup discussions.

"Tried this last time, but of course her situation is different /s. Feels like a bad rendition of Romeo and Juliet "
"No history. All of this is completely unlike how she used to be.

No needle marks or paraphernalia, but I wonder about the people she hangs out with. She goes out to clubs and parties every weekend, some weeknights, and has started doing party drugs like molly. Until a year ago she'd never touched a drug beyond weed. She's taken that up again too after many years, now smoking weed in the house. She's also started going to raves. RAVES. At 47.

She has a new group of ""girlfriends"" mostly in their 30s who are all very into partying, getting high and drunk, splurging on luxury and designer items, and living it up. These people have a lot of gossip and drama, her phone is constantly going off. She gets irritable and snaps at me when she has to put her phone down to do something or can't get to a text right away. 

There's constant new makeup, clothes, shoes, jewelry, and handbags arriving from Amazon. She recklessly spends money shopping in real life too, and on spas, booze, uber, and social outings like clubs and concerts.

I have three addiction worries-- alcohol, drugs, and shopping."
"If he's calling you things like that, he doesn't think highly of you and things really aren't very good at all."
I know. That's why I was shocked when he confronted me. He's the one who caused this whole mess. 
"And love the edit... ""I did it because I was mad at you""
  
Okay so how would opening the relationship work then?  If you literally did it out of spite... you're just asking permission to hurt your partner.  "
And when reading the title I assumed you didn't feel the same way. Go for it! 
"&gt;Gah, as I write this it sounds really bad. I don’t know, though, is this just marriage?

No, it is the antithesis of marriage. Your spouse is supposed to be: trustworthy, reliable, strengthening, a sanctuary from the day-to-day shit.

Your husband is none of those things. You cannot trust him (he can be violent). You cannot rely on him (he is uncommunicative and does not take you seriously), he does not make your life easier (makes you do more work) and he makes you feel worse, not better."
"Don't sleep on this advice. Seems like the most reasonable to me. 

She's young, is it something her mother is aware of and might have a better opinion than the rest of us?"
"Yup. This right here, OP."
"My brother is “Kate” and please listen when I tell you— that *alone* is not a red flag. She’s been very (likely painfully on her part) honest with you because she respects you, and herself, enough not to lie.

"Yes and if she broke the skin in any way, you need to have it looked at by a doctor, OP. Human mouths are nasty, and cause infection in bites alarmingly easily."
"It sounds like you don’t have to do much to cut contact with someone who has only messaged you once in six months. I wouldn’t recommend blocking him on all platforms - that’s just going to get his attention, which you don’t want, since you want to cut contact."
"Prioritize Chloe at this point.  She’s in real danger of dying or severe long term health consequences.  Ashley can wait and she’s a legal adult.  Frankly if mom is that bad, Ashley can leave on her own.  Chloe can’t as a minor.

I would sit Ashley down and explain that, while you love and support her, the facts are as the the above.  

Best of luck."

"Even if she were interested, I’d think it would be an ethical issue for her to date a patient. 

Nevertheless I’m not a believer in asking a person out at their place of work. That’s not why they’re there, you know? If you saw her out sometime and she flirted with you, that would be one thing. But asking anyone out at their place of work is just cringe-inducing. "

"Luckily I'm not really ever pushed to work more than 8 hours a day. But yeah, I do work hard during those 8 hours.

I have told him it like this. ""You wouldn't burst into my office to hang out or try to have sex with me, or invite me out to do stuff. And when I'm working remotely, you've gotta treat wherever I am like my office. You can get in touch if it's an emergency, but it's not a time or place I can just chill and do whatever"""

"So...I'm confused. Why did you contact this person that you hate, that ""sucked the life out of you"" for 9 months, and then do them a huge favor with the sweet interview hook up? (Which would be a crazy nice thing to do for even a best friend, let alone a frenemy like her) Also, the ""ugh, why"" indicates you did this very reluctantly so...did she know you knew a person and begged you?  Even still, you then take it another notch up and go to coffee with this person? Were you trying to give them a second chance or what?

I'm very curious as to what drove you to make those decisions. Because if I were you, she'd be dead to me the second the door closed on that apartment, and I'm not all that unforgiving."
"Dude, if his friends stay longer and establish tenancy, you won't even be able to kick them out. "
"You've warned her several times about this scam and she still hasn't listened. The only thing you can do now is to show her proof from other people's stories online about similar scams. And if that doesn't convince her, you just need to tell her that you won't be her backbone for her stupidity if she ends up homeless from this. It's her choice.

Since you are a power of attorney, I would take any remaining money from your grandmother's inheritance and put it into an account that she can't touch."

You need to learn to say ""I learned things about ____ that I did not know before, and I've taken new measure of his character.""

Also, it doesn't sound like you disbelieve these allegations - you think this guy is a serial sexual harasser. So why are you considering defending or deflecting to him? Are you going to be the bad guy in someone else's metoo moment?

Finally, your self-doubt might be planted - just like abusers groom victims for sexual abuse, most manipulative politicians also groom their lieutenants to be easily manipulable. Maybe you really are in the position to run student government because you earned it, not because he gave it to you."
This is always my MO. People like to put me down for some reason when they meet me and I just tell them they're being weird. That usually dismantles the hostility pretty quickly. 
"Most leases have an option for the renter to unilaterally terminate the lease for a fee. Frequenty it requires two months notice PLUS two months rent (meaning you need to stay for two more months and pay a two month fee on top of that). You might also give up your security deposit, but that varies by contract.

I'm a landlord, and personally I don't want somebody living in my unit if they don't want to be there, so I always wave the two months notice and negotiate the fee depending on the situation. Some landlords will be really strict. You have some leverage. If you literally can't afford rent and don't pay, the landlord will want you out asap and may reduce the fees as long as you leave quickly. Not all landlords are going to bother with reporting to your credit because it doesn't benefit them.

I think the first step is to explain the situation and ask what your options are."
"I don't really see how it can be a long-term problem because your husband knows exactly what is going on, and everyone else in the group does not. I would just ignore it, and if anyone brings up that they are going to tell your husband, just say go ahead.

Did your husband tell the group chat he is clearly aware Alex is living at your house? Because I feel like that's the only ""there's stuff you don't know"" that these immature people could come up with.

But I could see how this would all be very obnoxious. If you want to retire from the sport I feel like that'd be fine too."

This relationship is extremely toxic. You both have significant issues you need to work on alone.
"Had a bf who was like this. Turned out to be an abusive narcissist. He would say things like he knew he was destined to make loads of money or if he'd been on the right training programmes etc since a child he would now be a pro athlete in whatever field he had trained in. He went to uni and failed 2nd year, scraped in for another go because of MY medical reasons (he made a case that it had an effect on him) and did no work and failed again.

He blamed his life's problems on his mother (she was an alcoholic) and after a while I became the reason for his problems. He would constantly gaslight me and have double standards simply because he felt he was more important. He literally thinks he is better than other people for the silliest reasons. It's one thing saying that but it's terrifying when someone starts to behave like they are better than everyone else and it'll happen if that's how he thinks. Take this as a red flag.

Edit: just to clarify I'm saying be cautious in case it's a similar scenario but I genuinely hope it isn't"
"She slapped you in the face?

If you pay for these bills, you are sending the message that it is ok for her to assault you, and blame you for her own mistakes. It will only further her narrative that this is your fault when the reality is that she is the only one to blame.

Don't accept blame, and don't let her back in your house.

She's trying to weaponize your niece right now to get her way."
"My ex was like this. Please go OP.  There are so many more lies under the surface, I can pretty much guarantee it. You need to save yourself-your bf is not a safe person for you. You're going to do all kinds of lasting harm by staying.

&gt;#He shamed you when he fucking cheated.#

Whenever you have the urge to blame yourself, reread that sentence and count your blessings you're not married to this asshole."

"Buy her a strap-on. Or flowers, idk"
"This is a case of ""give an inch and they take a mile"".

The more you pander to these ridiculous insecurities, the more they seem ""legitimate"" to your girlfriend and the worse they get. If you're apologizing and trying to make it up to her, that means in her mind she was obviously wronged. If instead you just go on your lunch with friend, and ignore your girlfriend's tantrums, she'll second guess herself, realize she's being ridiculous after talking to some colleges/friends, and come back apologizing to you. 

Don't let her emotions phase you, just be a rock. She hates these anxieities and if by being a rock and ignoring her it makes them go away (though it may seem harsh) she'll actually appreciate it in the long run. Tough love my friend."
"&gt; doesn't remember it? 

Oh he sure as hell remembers it. He remembers it, you remember it and Pepperidge Farm remembers it. He's just acting like he doesn't to a) throw you off and have you excuse it and b) more effectively lovebomb you.

Leave, leave, leave him now. You guys are 4 months in, he just gave you a little snapshot of who he really is. He is an abuser and you need to get out now."
"OP, you say you told your husband you want your car to stay nice ""for a little while."" That shows some recognition of the fact (?) that no matter what you want, he will eventually start driving and destroying your car.  Is that true?  Do you think that's inevitable?  Do you have any room in your relationship to say, ""You don't keep your cars up and they always end up destroyed, so I need to keep this vehicle as my own so it stays nice"" - like, do you think he would respect something like that, or is his attitude ultimately that all possessions the two of you own are really just his because you're a SAHM?"
"Couple of issues

1. You came to him with your mind already made up
2. You didn't ask, you told

If I were a betting man, I'd say he thinks you've cheated on him. "
Has he not seen that you being inconvenienced is kinda his responsibility too and offered to help you out? You're common-law?! Why are you still totally financially separate? 
"Well, move out and don't pay for the place you don't live in. Prepare to lose your relationship with your mother. "
"&gt;Case in point: Last night, I got home from work around 6:00. He had texted me around 4:30 that he was taking a nap and was still upstairs when I got home. I had stopped to pick up dry cleaning and had my hands full so I walked up to our guest room to put my clothes in the closet (I keep mine there so he can have the master closet). I walk in to give him a kiss and say hi and am greeted with, “I would appreciate if you would take your high heels off before you come clomping around the house waking me up.”

Was that a rude way to greet you? Yeah, I'd say so. *How* rude depends more on the context of how it was said, his attitude, follow-up, etc. And boy oh boy do we get some insight into that:

&gt;I go downstairs to read a book until he comes down and we start cooking dinner. **I ask how he is doing and he tells me he thinks I disrespected him by walking around the house with my shoes on** and please follow common courtesy in the future. 

What the actual fuck? This is either psychosis or he's a controlling asshole who's trying to put you down over a dumb, small thing that shouldn't be an issue. My money's on the latter. Seriously he is being a gigantic asshole here. That's also a common tactic of abusers: make every little thing about you ""not respecting them"" and punishing you for failing to follow their stupid rules, rules that you may not have known existed (no shoes in the house when he's napping?? wtf?). It's incredibly inconsiderate besides...you'd think he'd be happy to see his wife/get off his napping ass to help with groceries/dinner but instead he lectures you like a child for having the gall to disturb his nap? Sounds like the rumblings of an emotional abuser....

&gt;So this devolves because he thinks I should apologize for being disrespectful and I think he should apologize for hurting my feelings. **He doesn’t think I am right to have my feelings hurt.**

Alright, so I didn't want to jump to the r/relationships standard of ""he's an abuser/breakup!"" but that statement he made could not be any more clear that he doesn't respect you as a partner. He literally told you that *you don't have a right to your feelings.* That's so bass-ackward and wrong I'm kinda at a loss for words. This sounds like controlling, manipulative , and punishing behaviors that he's engaging in. That's emotional abuse.

I'm betting he's like this a lot when you have ""disagreements"" and that it's usually over inane shit that he blows out of proportion:

&gt;Usually we have a great relationship, however we don’t disagree well at all. Little things get dragged out because of this.

Yep.

Does he have a mood disorder or personality disorder? Is this new behavior or was he like this when you were dating/engaged?

Seriously though you guys need marriage counseling. His attitude is frankly disturbing: he has zero empathy for you and has no problem saying that to your face. He creates arguments over nothing (walking in after work/errands with your shoes on? really? that is some petty bullshit) and destroys your self-esteem and then tells you that you have no right to be upset. IDK how this marriage ends in anything but divorce if that's his attitude towards you, but you need to make marriage counseling a requirement if you're not ready for that.


**EDIT** and the shit-cherry on top of the poo-cake:

&gt;He always tells me when I slip up, but when he does things I find gross or rude (farting loudly in front of me or leaving clutter around the house), “that’s just part of life.”

Double standards and a huge hypocrite. He's never wrong, is he? His behavior is never the problem, is it? It's always *your* flawed reaction. Because he's an emotional abuser."
"This could be her way of showing empathy. Unless he mentions it elsewhere, this could very well be her way of trying to sympathize. I mean, it's hard enough finding words to say when someone loses a loved one, it's going to be much harder if you feel some responsibility in lifting their spirits."
I would like to know that too; did he remember to sort his own sticker? 
"You have a mouth. She has ears. 

Use your mouth to make sound that goes through her ears, that involves this message. 

“I. Want. To. Be. Alone. For. The. Last. 2. Hours. Of. The. Night”

c: "
"That’s not gonna work. This guy couldn’t care less, and he has lots more experience at psychological manipulation than you do. And do you really want him knowing private info that he may share with the whole school?"
"This is a man who is putting in no effort into the relationship. Dead bedroom, different life goals, and not agreeing on child issues are bad signs. Get marriage counseling and, if that doesn’t work, think of divorce."
"It sounds like you've basically gone there already, but you need to set up a clear boundary and explain why it makes you uncomfortable and hurts your feelings/is just unnecessary. You said that this wasn't a problem before you developed stronger feelings, so it's possible she got used to it and thought it was fine with you.

For some people (myself included) talking about past stuff can be a bonding exercise - I like to discuss good and bad aspects of previous encounters/relationships as a way of explaining my current outlook, or learning how my partner would have reacted. It sounds like your girlfriend might be the same as me and have not even clocked that it was insensitive to you. From the fact that she ""gets the point \[you were\] making"", I'm guessing she wasn't being actively malicious or trying to mess with you. Now that she knows it's a no-go area, this can either cease to be a problem or become an incompatibility, depending on how she treats it."
She wiped a whole computer to delete internet history.  That's pretty... over the top.
"1) You need to set the ground rules for what about your relationship you are comfortable him discussing with his friends. If you don't want him talking about the details of your sex life, you need to make that clear to him. If he refuses to abide by that, then it's a major incompatibility.

2) You should not feel any shame for being intimate with your boyfriend. 

3) Your boyfriend sounds pretty immature. "
"If you forget the gender of the other person (he may be bisexual), the main thing I'd say is that he was cheating on you with someone else."
My guess would be she’s doing it specifically for someone else in the orchestra in retaliation for something they said or did regarding her proficiency level. OP should talk to her and figure out what happened.
"Sometimes people who’re struggling with depression can interpret concern as criticism and many people who’re passionate about their hobbies can feel very defensive about them.* 

To head this off and make it clear you’re on his side, consider making it really clear that you’re impressed with how well he takes care of them. After all, if something happens to him because he’s not taking care of himself, what will happen to his fish? 

He’ll need to get better for himself, but maybe knowing both that they’re at risk if he is (more incentive) and that he has your interest (he can talk to you about what’s important to him including the fish) and your support (including recognition of what he’s doing well) would help with taking those difficult first steps and getting the ball rolling?

"“The mom won’t let me see him” nine times out of ten is a total line.  I say this as a single mom with an ex (and father of said kid) who tells EVERYONE that the reason he has no relationship with his child is because I won’t allow it.  

Do you know how much being a single mom SUCKS?  Even if your ex is a monster, everyone wants a night off sometimes, or help with school pickup, or someone to stay home with the sick kid because you can’t miss work.
In most cases, shit either has to be REALLY bad (like, abuse he hasn’t disclosed) or the other parent is just telling a convenient story to explain why they take no part in their kid’s life.  Plus, the added benefit of getting to have OP feel sooooooo bad for him because of his evil ex. 

Sure, there are DEFINITELY evil women out there who forbid perfectly good fathers from seeing their kids - but if the dad really cares, there are often plenty of legal avenues to explore, or ways to participate if they really want to.  I don’t mean to discount people who have genuinely tried...but from OPs story, it sounds like this guy barely tries at all."

"&gt;My husband is angry with her for ""screwing over"" his parents but also acknowledges the points that I've made to him that they played a part in the breakdown as well. He feels loyalty to his parents more than anything else though.

I have a hard time believing your husband isn’t more responsible for these lost friendships than you are aware. You don’t know what he’s been telling people who ask him about his parents or complain about them. "
"I mean, if you decided to sow your wild oats with a (pick whatever race) girl for a couple years, than dumped her solely because you felt her race wasn't suitable to marry... I mean, how in the world would you go around afterwards thinking that wasn't racist? That's classic scummy racist behavior.

""black people are good enough to have sex with but aren't suitable for whites to marry"" is like the most classic old-school racist shit we've got going. That's some founding father shit. You've gotta respect yourself enough to realize this girl is trash on a basic level and you deserve so much better than this."

Probably he's mad he wasn't smart enough to think of doing this himself. This isn't about being ethical.

She's not being ridiculous, and the fact that you're approaching the issue this way is frankly pretty disgusting. "
"Any time they make a critical comment that you don't like, simply tell them not to talk to you like that. Say, ""I don't want to hear how I'm never around or my meals are unhealthy or whatever. Stop bringing it up, you're making me uncomfortable in my own home and your opinion on my behavior, habits, and life is unwanted.""

If you're not willing to be that forthright, the comments will continue so you'll just have to keep ignoring them. 

This sounds like an annoying arrangement and if I were you I'd start thinking about finding somewhere else to live."
"I think there was just a little communication error that could have prevented all this. I think this would have all been avoided if you had said, ""Hey, so I only get two convocation tickets. I really want you to come, but I also want my parents to come. I am 99% sure that I will be able to just buy an extra ticket off of somebody so all 3 of you can come, but if I can't, would you be cool with skipping out on the ceremony and celebrating with us afterward?""

But the way it unfolded he clearly assumed he was going for much of the conversation, and was getting his hopes up and looking forward to it, and then was disappointed when he heard your full plan. I think he shouldn't have been so pouty afterward and he should grow up a little, but in the future for big events try to put a little more planning into your communication about it so that you can set expectations well."
"I know deep in my heart violence is *never* the solution, but I fucking know for a fact had that been said to me or my wife I would fucking strike the person saying it across the face like I wished my slap would snap their neck into oblivion.

"Omg girl, I read through your post history. You poor thing. The next few months are going to be tough (as others have said). I really recommend therapy to help you process, so that you don't fall into another relationship like this.

"Don’t sign the birth certificate without a paternity test first.

Depending on your state our state allows fathers to sign a legally binding affidavit.  If they sign it and then find out that they are not the father there is absolutely no guarantee the courts will care.

"I know. It wasn't even the first time I'd gotten it. I think it was the fact that he *hadn't* actually exploded, plus the speed of the whole interaction, that made that 30 seconds in a Staples matter so much more than all the times I'd had to pull people aside and make actual apologies. Like, what could I even say to this girl? ""Sorry, you actually caught us on a good day""? She looked like she already knew anyway.

And that's the worst part, the part no one talks about: It's **humiliating**. That's become your reality. So, is this how it's going to be? Him, embarrassing you, regularly, without shame, and you apologizing, *for the rest of your life?*"

"&gt;But feeling alone while in a relationship? That's a loneliness that'll really get to you.

Right on the money. I've been pretty much alone all my life. I don't have many friends, my family mostly sucks and I didn't have a relationship until I was 22. But never have I felt so lonely and miserable as when I was dating my ex. Now I'm alone again, my only friend is moving away and I feel better than 8 months ago. Feeling lonely IN a relationship is a whole new universe of suck."
"He has Madonna/whore syndrome. There's u/dhvet whom he ""loves"" and wants to marry but doesn't want to have sex with, and then there are women he's sexually attracted to but is incapable of loving, because seeing them as sexual beings makes them unworthy in his eyes. Love and lust are mutually exclusive to him. He must be either very manipulative or extremely lacking in self-awareness to actually believe this is how things work for all men.
"
"I have very few people I would consider close friends.My parents weren't social people and were happy with their home life and as a result, I never learned by watching how to make friends. I was excluded and picked on growing up. I don't attach to people easily and find making new friends to be mentally draining. 

My husband is a social butterfly. Sometimes it bugs him that I don't have more friends -- then he remembers that I'm *happy* this way. I like people. I can be social when I want or need to. I don't expect my husband to entertain me 24 hours a day.

So, biased, but I wouldn't consider it an immediate red flag. Has she expressed to you whether or not she's lonely?

"He has been using you since the very beginning.

You should have ended this long ago, but since you have not, you should end this now.

People do what they want, every single time.  If he wanted to behave differently, he would.  He does not want to, and has never wanted to, because he has been able to act this way and keep you on the hook.  So no, he's not going to get better, and neither is the relationship.

&gt; Also, I do not know were he should go. He has no money.

This is not your problem to solve for him.

You don't see it, but not only is he mooching off of you, but he's also abusing you:

&gt; When I complain about not getting any attention, he will either make me believe I am crazy or that I am stupid for being jealous

This is called ""gaslighting"", and it's an abuse behavior.

You have your own issues to sort out.  Stop being his crutch as well.

I draw the line at the bathroom thing - you can work on spending more quality time together, you can ask him to be more attentive, but you can't change the fact that he thinks violating your firm boundary is hilarious.

He's a child. I'm sorry, I don't know of any cure for being an asshole."
"I think the only thing that will sink in for megan at this point is to be called out directly after doing something rude, maybe even firmly in public.

Also, if worse comes to worse and you guys ever do divorce, please remember that you won’t be on good terms. Allowing your husband to be legally entitled to half of a home when you/your family is the entire reason you’re able to buy it is probably not a good idea. And, I don’t know how you can get around the requirement in a property settlement that the person who put the down payment down gets all of it back if the property is sold. At any rate, I would make sure that you talk to a lot of attorneys about that plan and have one of them draft it and hopefully have others look at it to give their feedback. And it sounds to me like it is scamming your dad; Believe it or not his idea of protecting you is probably a good one, given the high divorce rate in this country and how much money this is. Whether it comes from a good place or not is irrelevant, you should seriously think about taking advantage of that gift by drafting some weird agreement that absolves your husband from his responsibility to repay the initial cost of the home if you guys get divorced. What if he cheats on you? What if he develops a drug problem? What if he abuses you or abuses your children? You really want him to walk away with half of your major asset and have you be the only one on the hook for the loan, so that a divorce court judge can’t order him to pay out of his share of your community property? Bad plan. Your dad has your long term best interests at heart, if you take the money, put something that satisfies his purpose behind the gift to protect yourself.

A) see a therapist for yourself as your parents are controlling. B) learn to drive yourself so you aren't stuck if you visit your parents. C) ask your boyfriend why he doesn't like driving and see if he can work to over come it. D) stop engaging with your parents over your relationship; set boundaries about not talking about it and enforce them.

"Wow. I don’t know, this sounds like a fundamental imbalance of your marriage that’s resulted in your kids feeling like you’re an actual parent and Mom is someone to walk on eggshells around. I’d definitely suggest counseling- for her individually, maybe for you too, marriage counseling, and as a family. I truly wish you the best, you’re an amazing father and you deserve to feel loved and appreciated by your partner and not just your kids. "
"Short, sweet, and to the point. OP, this is perfect advice. Reach out to your RA or any other oversight committee in your school (preferably via email or text, that way you have a record of the exact words that were exchanged) and tell them you feel uncomfortable with Chris’s actions and are worried that he will escalate. After all, if he’s like this only a few weeks into the semester, chances are he will start acting creepier as time goes on. Let them know he’s taken pictures of you without your consent, and has broken into your room. Let them know what’s going on before talking with Chris, and tell them that you’re worried about how he’ll respond to the rejection. They may offer to mediate, or offer other tools to help. (However, if they dismiss your discomfort, you may need to consider getting other parties involved. Hopefully your school is one that understands the severity of the situation - but if they don’t then don’t back down. Chris is harassing you, and action needs to be taken or things may escalate. The second the school acts dismissive towards you, reach out to your parents or other outside parties that can help and come up with an action plan.)

After you’ve gotten your school on board with helping, I would also reach out to Chris via text/email for the same reasons - a paper trail. Be clear that you are not comfortable with his actions, explicitly state that he violated your privacy and personal boundaries and said racially insensitive things, and are not interested in any sort of relationship with him now or ever. Let him know you’ve already informed campus about your discomfort and have asked them to keep an eye on the situation, that way he knows to keep on his best behavior. Once you’ve said your piece, I would recommend telling him that you are blocking him from all platforms - and then following through. He may try to continue pushing your boundaries by pleading with you to at least be “friends,” but I would recommend completely cutting off contact - as in, no small talk, no approaching you during parties, nothing. Otherwise, if he tries to convince you he only wants to be friends or have small talk, he may start pushing the limit again. Tell him his actions made you uncomfortable and, for better or worse, you can’t ever trust him enough to have any sort of friendly relationship with him beyond just “dorm-mates.” If he tries cornering you or talking again, just repeat that you’re uncomfortable and don’t wish to talk with him. Remember, he violated social norms first - so you’re under no obligation to try and “let him down easy” or be nice. He needs to hear the clear and unadulterated truth about how his actions have affected you - both for your sake and for his own sake. It’s better he learns this lesson as early as possible so he can start thinking about how his actions are coming across to others. Also, let your friends know what’s going on - you’ll probably need backup while Chris is coming to terms with what’s going on. Good luck!"

"&gt; I think one of the things that bothers me most is that when he gets upset he gets violent and that terrifies me. He throws things, throws his phone or whatever he’s holding; recently I was very sick with laryngitis, totally voiceless, and he made dinner and brought it into the bedroom for me. I asked him for some water(by holding out my cup and mouthing the request) and he cussed and threw down the plate he was holding onto the bed so hard that the food on it flipped over onto the bed. I freaked out and mouthed, “You don’t have to,” and held the cup to my chest. He ordered me to give him the cup, then raised his voice at me when I wouldn’t... then came around the bed and took it from me forcibly. I was crying and completely terrified. Afterwards, he hasn’t brought this up except that, because I was clearly shying away/distant with him, he bought me a stuffed animal.

Here’s where it becomes unfixable. 

This is cookie cutter cycle of abuse. This could be the example in a textbook on abusive relationships, it’s so clear cut. This isn’t “just marriage” - you married an abuser. And it’s only going to get worse as you become increasingly dependent on him. He will make it more difficult for you to work, to have friends, to have hobbies that he doesn’t share. And he will do all of this by playing the victim and making *you* feel like the bad guy. 

Even if you’re not ready to leave yet, make sure your birth control is rock solid, and that you maintain your access to money that he can’t take from you. Take care of your own mental health to the best of your ability. And start at least toying with the idea of leaving. Think through the logistics. Where would you go? Who would you tell? How much money will you need for a lawyer? Immigration issues? Shelter? Transportation? Make a mental list of the things you’d need in a pinch if he escalates and puts you in physical fear. Have a plan - just in case. Even if you don’t want to use it just yet. You’ll feel better knowing that you won’t be stumbling blind when the day comes."
"As a white woman, I probably wouldn’t attend a wedding at a plantation. "
"The problem is not that he wants it constantly.

The problem is that he is not respecting the NO.

So have you asked him why he doesn't respect the NO?

Follow-up question: You do know there's a name for people who behave the way your boyfriend does, yes?

Edit: You do know that you are under no obligation to stay with people who treat you poorly or try to fix them, yes?"
"""...you can't get fooled again"""
"This is completely out of line, wtf was he thinking. Actually it doesn’t matter, I would be so fucken mad and he would know it. Then I would tell him to choose this marriage or the car. Because marriage means that y’all are a team and big purchases are made ~together~."
"&gt; TL;DR: 10/10 would boyfriend steal again. 

But but but... you cannot steal a boyfriend if he wasn't her boyfriend to begin with.

You have an original, legitimately acquired boyfriend.

This is nitpicking. For everything else, yay! "
"Team girlfriend.

Look, dude, that set up works great for YOU.  As an unmarried couple though that means she has zero rights to the home now or in the future.  So lets say she helps pay for all of these renovations and then you break up.  She gets no money back and no good rental reference.

Housing costs are high so I definitely see the appeal.  I also guarantee that your dad is NOT going to want to sign over a family property to a girlfriend (which I also agree with).

Fix those problems and everything will be sunshine and roses for BOTH of you."

"&gt;  It's been a month since we've last had sex, and I haven't told him it's because of this

You should."
"It's not ""mothering"".  It's setting boundaries.  You are allowed to have your own possessions in a marriage, and set rules for when you will share those possessions with other people.  It's not a parent/child relationship, it's a matter of ownership of property.  He may get his feelings hurt; it's never fun to hear that your weaknesses have consequences.  But just because his feelings are hurt doesn't mean you are wrong or out of line.   Sometimes consequences are painful...treating your own car like trash is NOT going to inspire confidence in other people that you can keep their cars clean and intact.  That's just a fact of life, not a thing you're saying to him to hurt his feelings.  "
"Oh boy. I had a feeling from your thread that your wife might be Asian but didn't want to ask (mine is too). Basically, there's a thing with Asian moms and demanding respect in irrational ways. There's a post somewhere on Reddit, maybe on /r/raisedbynarcissists, in which an Indian person goes into very illuminating detail about the mother culture in Asian societies and it explains so much..."
"Yes, pleasant but firm is what I'm trying to go for. I'll keep those words in mind. Thank you"
"This is a situation where a little more context might be helpful. Have you told him you are on the fence about having children and he’s giving you an ultimatum to make a decision before getting married? That’s actually not that unreasonable. You should be on the same page before committing to one another. 

Or are you against having children and he’s trying to pressure you into having one? That sucks and he’s not a great person for doing that to you. I could see where you would be really hurt and feel like an incubator in this case. 

Ultimately the end result is the same, I guess: break up with him if you don’t want to have a child. It’s just not something you can compromise on in any way, and if you don’t agree you will never be fundamentally compatible. In the future, try not to date people who want kids. "
"Yeah my conductor would be like ""who the fuck was that? Doesn't matter, don't do it a fuck again"". Not sure how she's been doing this without someone telling her off"
"&gt; We're all on the same lease. As we put in the main post, there is nothing in the lease other than guests staying for extended periods of time.

Sorry, I missed that part.

That being the case, let her try to call the police.  If she actually goes through with it (and it's not just feather-fluffing on her part) and *if* the police even bother to show up after she tells them that the lawful residents of your place are having guests over in accordance with the lease and *she doesn't like it*, they'll do nothing, and if she tries again, they'll eventually sort her out.

Y'all need to go to your landlord and see if anything can be done to get her to move on. "
"I think it's been stated enough, but your husband does not own your body and ultimately you should do what's best for you. Having another child, as you know, being a mother, is a huge commitment on top of any potential problems that may happen to your mental health as a result. 

My suggestion would be to ask your husband why exactly he wants a son? It may be an issue of traditional gender roles, in which case he should realize that a daughter can fulfill whatever kind of legacy he might hope for his son. If it's a matter of carrying on the family name, well, women don't have to change their names anymore if they don't want to lol. 

I hope everything works out for you and that your mental health continues to improve! "
"Everything here is spot on. OP's post and others like hers break my heart. It's so depressing knowing that someone could be treated so terribly and still try to cling to the relationship. Like, what are they even fighting for anymore? Someone that never even existed in the first place? I truly hope that OP listens to your advice."
"&gt;but I'm just mentally done.

Being mentally done is the exact right time to issue an ultimatum.

You can do it with love. Often when people neglect dental work to this extent it's because of depression or anxiety. Speak to him about the mental health issues contributing to this state of affairs and discuss getting help and treatment together in a supportive way. He may even have some sort of dental phobia that needs to be addressed in a professional setting, that is hard for him to admit.

Discuss the correlation of dental health with lifespan and tell him how difficult it is for you to watch him essentially killing himself and shaving years off his life. Make an emotional plea that you want him to see your kids grow up and you want your marriage to be healthy in the bedroom.

Don't let him stonewall. Even if this is a one-sided conversation make him hear you out."
"You asked for a back room and you got one. Can you keep your hockey stuff somewhere else, like a basement?"
"&gt;She said ""You can only have us both"". ""dont you like my horse? at the beginning you seemed to like it, was that just to get laid? did you lie to me?""

You're so fucked."
"OP, you have to find a way to move out. Go talk to your dean at school, tell them what's going on, see if the school can help you find housing. Make an amazing life for yourself, get therapy, and create a family of your choice. I'm so sorry you had the terrible luck to be born to a person like that, and I'm sorry your dad is an enabler of her abuse."

That is a perfect description."
