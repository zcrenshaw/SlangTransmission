"Poor thing, I completely understand the embarrassment. 

The important thing to remember is that you’re all adults and therefore everyone is aware (hopefully) of what a period is and how mistakes can happen.

Deep breaths. I promise it’ll be alright. I can’t imagine they’d think negatively at all. Probably just sympathetic as hell."
"I was married to my boyfriend of 4 years. I thought he was all I wanted and I analyzed everything - weighed out my pros and cons - during our first year together and eventually decided that he was the one I wanted to grow old with. As the years pass... I started having doubts and the questions grew. I shrugged them off thinking it was just a phase. We got married and 7 mos after,  I bailed. I left because I realized that all the doubts I had then were valid. That all the questions I started asking myself stood until today. 

Now I'm seeing this guy for just 2 months now and somehow... deep inside, I ""just know"". I found myself saying that in all the uncertainties hanging around us right now, he's my only clarity. The only thing I'm certain of.  He asked me if one day I would want to marry him and in a heartbeat, I said yes. And I know deep down inside that I really truly do. 

My point being? The moment you started having doubts and questions... it's not worth pursuing. If you can't imagine yourself being with this person and growing old with this person.... let go. For your own sake and for his. Don't waste each other's time. Life's too short for such. Hope it helps and good luck! :)"
"PM me your book title too please, /u/Erinzono! I'd love to support you and your writing career, and I'm always looking for new books to read."
":-)

Perhaps I should write a business book about how to manage family businesses. I could call it  *""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""*"
Then i hope your copying the messages and securing them so if something does happen someone can find them.
"I know, right? 

Girl, he is NOT good for your mental health. Worrying that much is not about love, it's about control. 

Also, congrats on the tattoo! It was an accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself. Screw all that other noise."
"I agree with most of what you’re saying except for one thing - her mother isn’t going to be there to help her. Her goal is to have my SD move in with her and stop working to take care of the baby so that she’ll have free childcare for her two youngest children. She used my SD as a second mom for them when she lived there, which is part of the reason she moved out."
"Absolutely; if he physically can’t ignore his phone, which I totally get as everyone is guilty then it needs to be muted to an appropriate time, especially if it’s constantly going off, it’s just going to be a distraction from what should be his number one priority! As I said, if they need to get hold of him they can still reach out"

Me too! I’d love to check it out.
"It's so messed up when the people who are supposed to be your #1 cheerleaders actively work to undermine your success. I'm sorry that your parents are refusing to be the parents you need or deserve. I don't think it's going to get better, and unfortunately I think the best thing you can do is avoid these discussions altogether. *You* know how successful you are. *You* know that you have a promising career ahead of you. It seems like you aren't financially dependent on your folks (or at least are able to afford your own place), which is great. That will make it easier to control the dynamic by shutting down all conversations about finances and careers. ""We already know how you feel, so let's skip the part where you tell me to stop writing and tell Sister to start writing! How is Aunt Mary doing?"" If they insist on returning to the subject, well look at the time, you'd better head home! Try to encourage your sister to focus on the things *she* enjoys as well, even if they're just texts, it's one voice that isn't telling her what career to choose, which could be a big deal."
Men aren’t that good with gifts
All these plans are hypotheticals and get totally rewritten once you see tiny little fingers and tiny little toes.
"This needs to be top vote. Take these points to heart, OP. Be your own woman, and don't define yourself by the value others put into you"
"Child support is not for the mother, it’s for the child, it’s not hers to so cavalierly dismiss. Her thinking on that matter is probably a good indication of how prepared she is for this kind of responsibility, but be that as it may, the child support thing is an absurd stance, and you should set her straight there."
I’d just mute the chat so I wouldn’t receive the notifications until I had time to go in and check the chat. I dunno. Doesn’t sound like a huge deal to me at all. It’s up to him how he wants to handle his notification settings.
"I literally just said that I'm not comfortable with you being this close to him to which she asked me that do you want me to cut him off and I said yes, I do."
"thats how i read it too. yes what they are doing can be seen as disparaging to the OP, but it also looks like they may want the sister to do better. at anything at all. /u/Erinzozo does your sister have any hobbies, excels at anything else to the same degree as you? or in general does she do anything productive with her life?"
Sexy lingerie and a hot passionate time.  Its what all men want!
"A) he didn’t start the fight
B) he didn’t punch a hole in the wall. 

Now imagine you’re in a drunk disagreement with someone and some else else shows up and starts shoving you/getting physical? And that someone is the person you were arguing with’s brother...so your drunk brain has every reason to expect to be out numbered. 

Are you going to be a paragon of non violence?"
It's okay to give her a heads-up that you do love her but like to say it sparingly because it makes it feel more special to you when you do.
"I understand what you’re saying. The dynamic of the group chat itself isn’t the issue, it’s his attention to parts that don’t concern him especially when it interrupts times where we’re together. I agree with you.  I wish he were more conscientious of this."
So it sounds like they want to support your sister and you don’t think much of her. Nothing you wrote screams that she’s not proud of you. Maybe she wants your sister to be more like you since you have this focus and drive?
what makes you think hes a loser?
"I've only seen her get jealous about one of my friendships, and she did turn out to be correct. I was missing hints and didn't realize this ""friend"" was actually trying to get with me until they actually made a move one night, whereas my girlfriend noticed it right away."
"Maybe ask him to be more present when you are hanging out. Group texts often work the way you're describing sometimes sections of the group will have a conversation that doesn't involve all members. It doesn't really matter who the member are or the context, if he's staring at a screen when he shouldn't thats the problem."
Block him
"This sounds like you will be getting the trickle truth soon. 

She is hiding things from you and obviously lying to you."
It's SO fucked up that OP thinks she's the selfish one for asking for basic human consideration when he's the one refusing to work and using her for money.
"I mean, I'm childfree and I'm on team Papa Don't Preach right now XD"
"She's told me it's under her mom's name. But yeah, I agree with the last sentence completely. I don't know how I can convince her to move with her being somewhat dependent on her Mom because she's all she has."
It’s the lying to them also a “mistake”.
"Literally the only thing you did wrong here was getting so anxious about this that you didn't ask his mom for help. Like, she might have even wondered why you weren't saying anything, and been a bit off-put that you didn't think to do that instead of suffering in silence.

Seriously, just tell your SO what happened, and in a quiet moment with his mom next time you see her, make some kind of light hearted comment about it. She's dealt with worse, for sure."
Things I would never do either!
"Yeah so, you can’t just... not have feelings anymore. Wanting him to fail after what he did to you is pretty normal I’d say. See it as a voice of self-protection that is just fucking outraged on your behalf. Don’t get frustrated with yourself for not being literal Jesus. 

It’s okay, you’re already healing fast, you’re even in a new relationship, you’re in therapy, you’re doing great. Looking at his social media is probably not the healthiest thing but we all slip up sometimes."
"You can ask but be prepared for him to say no. This is who he is, if you're not cool with it it may be time to bail."
"No, it's not wrong at all, not crossing any boundaries. Not really any different than if you'd had a good guy friend pass away, and you stayed friends with his family. Hell, it's not wrong IMHO to stay friends with exes in general, as long as reasonable boundaries are maintained and they respect the relationship that you're in. In short, having *more* people that care about us (and that we care about) is generally a good thing."
"You're inviting him to collaborate and find affordable things you can both enjoy, so there shouldn't really be any conflict! Wanting to have fun together is a good thing, so don't let him try to convince you otherwise. You're too young to waste your time with someone who wants to be a total homebody, especially since you seem like an enjoyable person to be around. Good luck, I hope everything works out for the best!"

"Well that's it really. I turned 21, got a say, looked at the accounts, realised the business was losing money each year entirely because of his ridiculously high salary, so the company fired him."
"After all these years, and this still hit me. Thanks for being kind :)"
"“If one person calls you a horse’s ass, be curious. If three people … be reflective. After five people … buy a saddle.”"
"Oh girl dont worry! Dont mention it and dont be so hard on yourself. If they judge you for this then they aren't good people. I promise you though,  nobody will judge you. If they even noticed."
"That's terrible for your sister, too. What does she like to do and can you encourage that? Dance, sports, an instrument?

My husband's parents are like this, too. It's weird. No support or encouragement, except asking the other siblings, ""why don't you do x like y?"" Bizarre."
"Also, were they ever encouraging of your writing, and do you flaunt your talent around your family? It makes no sense to me that your parents would prefer you don’t have the capacity to write and instead wish for your sister to have it."
"Agree. You’re choosing to stay with a person who is basically mooching off you. Can’t believe you’ve mentioned having kids with this guy. Do you really think kids would benefit from a loser parent that refuses to do anything? OP, you’re only as stuck as you want to be."
The fact you tracked his whole trip and called the hotel tells me there hasn't been trust in awhile. It's not Google's fault.
"Absolutely guaranteed there is nothing to be embarrassed about. Even if they did notice, it'll not even cross their minds again; everyone's been there in some form or other - we're all humans with our own functions &amp; quirks.

Just forget about it, because they probably will have done!"
"Yes for sure. Right now one thing I am confused about is that we did have a phone conversation and send a few texts but then momentum stopped. But like you said, if I started trying to send more texts or something it would get confusing of where things are going. I feel like right now, I can't just outright say I want to get back together since we haven't been in any communication at all. It wouldn't be genuine for either of us. Which is why I'm not sure what to do right now"

"What your girlfriend is doing is not sustainable for you or your relationship, and you placating her and acting like she's being reasonable (or you're being the unreasonable one and trying to ""fix"" your behavior) is only going to make it worse.

This is something you need to communicate with her openly about and maybe look into couple's counseling together and therapy separately. You're going to reach a breaking point and it's not healthy for either of you. Not to excuse it, but how do you know this isn't WHY her husband cheated on her? He might have found someone that wasn't this clingy/needy/controlling."
"Doesn't seem weird to me in the slightest.

Girlfriend get this jealous about your relationships with anyone else?"
"Legal advice usually says not to block numbers so you can be aware if the messages begin to escalate to more active threats, that's why I haven't"
I love to cuddle my cat but I don't find him sexy. .
Then stop doing it. Leave. Make changes in your life.
Stop trying to get him to agree with you.   Book your airbnb now and tell him he should let her know that you already made other plans.
"This happened to me at 13. I was staying over at my best friend's house, and we stayed in her little brother's room because he had a double bed. I didn't realize I had bled through until I got HOME, there was no way it wasn't on his bed. No one ever mentioned it to me."
"you can try, but it's like asking someone not to drink wine on a date. why does it matter to you so much?"
"&gt;Apparently she's refinancing the car under her own name and not her moms.

You said lease.  Leases can't be ""refinanced"" and she still doesn't have enough income or a driver's license.

You aren't getting correct information, so I'd suggest you stop focusing on the car.  It doesn't matter.  It could be 100% in her name and leaving would end up with a repo on her record and it still doesn't matter.  The car is not the problem.  The abuse and her inability to leave is."
I love this mentality. Sometimes we’re too harsh on ourselves and don’t give other people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to empathizing with us
"This is a problem with your boyfriend, not the dog. The dog is acting like a dog, and your boyfriend apparently can't handle that. He needs to deal with his anxiety in a big way and stop punishing the dog for stretching and yawning.

Your boyfriend is failing this dog, and it's not fair to the dog."
"You’re friends might be right; however, I know for a fact that some police departments will do this for you - so you don’t have to have any direct contact."
YES to all of this! I started the buying process with my ex-boyfriend less than a year of dating because he didn’t want to rent and I went along with it. We broke up early 2018 and I’m still dealing with the deed to the flat that we jointly bought.
"Imagine you have a daughter, and she's describing this situation to you.  What would you recommend her do?  Have that conversation in your mind, and then follow your own advice."
Ray dumped water on a CHILD. Dude is abusive.
"Yeah It was a heat of the moment thing for me. She was dropping me off at the airport for my Vegas trip and I was thinking how fun it'd be to go together. I did this to myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes just realized 50-60 bucks per meal is luxury spending. I can tell her that should put the trip on hold until she can comfortably contribute a good amount (she has some savings but not sure if she'd like to spend it on the trip)."
"It's not about the phone dude. You just 0-100 talking about some girl getting her teeth kicked in so openly is off putting as hell. I know you're convinced I'm a bad person. But frankly, you have no basis. It's just really fuckin weird and unsettling. 
My boyfriend might be controlling or whatever, but he's never nonchalantly talked about a girl getting beat. So."
You were invited. Your bf's parents might have been more concerned about seeing less of their son than any interference from you. Don't take their comments too seriously. You only heard it as a third party anyway. Pretend everything is good but be aware of their concern.

"THIS OP!!!

If you've already told her about her SO's shitty behavior before (I didn't read the full post, sorry hun), don't bring it up again.

All that this will do, is make her feel as though she can't come to you if she decides to lesve, because she'll feel that it might become an ""I told you so"" situation.

Just be there for her, and be a good friend. One day she will realise, and if you are a good friend, she will ask for help."
"Thank you for writing this. I guess some of this could apply to her.. I want her to stop but at the same time I do feel like I deserve abuse for getting fat. All my life I equated getting fat with being a disgusting failure and it's hard to stop thinking that.

It's so hard to know what to do, I really do love this girl despite everything."
"&amp;#x200B;

Many weddings have head counts for activities like a sit down dinner.

We had a great aunt get sick and that opened up 5 or 6 seats at our wedding a few days before the wedding and we had to pay for the seats we'd ordered, so we were paying even if no one sat there. I hate paying for things and not using them, so we were offering seats to random people as the wedding approached.

That doesn't mean that OP has to delay her plans for an invitation that may not come.

Not sure why anyone would assume that the bride is just being polite unless she dislikes OP for some reason."
"This will be a wonderful thing to one day write about, sorry you’re being treated as lesser"
when you broke up with her did you tell her it was because you think you are not sexually compatible? if so what was her response?
"Yes because when a man is pro life they are wanting a right to woman’s body. And that’s BS. 

If you don’t want to get a girl pregnant that could have an abortion don’t ejaculate into her body. Problem solved. You know it’s a possibility so don’t do it."
"I wonder if the autism diagnosis is legit, the mom doesn't sound like she's had any professional input in how to handle him/his outbursts.

Maybe he's actually sociopath and the mom is claiming autism so everyone excuses him."
"You love the idea of this guy, not the actual guy. In fact, you have no idea who the actual guy is. You know the version he's shown you, and even that version kind of sucks. 

Focus on school and yourself. This dude isn't worth it, whoever or whatever he is."
"&gt;OP refusing to say what was wrong, and refusing to state her needs or confront the issue is a problem she has to deal with for herself. She needs to learn how to state her needs and communicate her feelings effectively.


OP was probably traumatized by her friend's casual betrayal of her trust."
I have literally fished a clogged toilet out with a solo cup and rinsed it down a sink to prevent anyone from knowing I clogged a toilet. I deep cleaned the whole bathroom. He didn’t know until years later that it happened :). Disgusting but like a boss.
No doubt the dude is a piece of shit. Abso garbage human who she should get away from. 2 wrongs still don't make a right. Cheating is still for cowards.
This all sounds like he's gotten himself involved in something that is very likely illegal.
"she didn't seem fazed by it, thought it was funny."
No one has control over their period. I'm sure his parents mature enough to figure that out.
Yes...except I don't believe you.
"Now you've completely embarrassed yourself in front of all of Reddit by neglecting to use an apostrophe in your title, which you can't edit!

Paragraphs are a thing, too."
"yes, yes and yes. baby momma and i are on good terms.

- why should she? it's not her business. isn't a guy who takes care of his kid and is there for it shows that he's responsible and also that he's a man?"
"Yes she does have a cat as well. She has spent lots of time with both me and my cat. She adored the cat everytime she was over and knows me the best on how much I loved him. 

I have non pet friends\family and they have been so supportive during this time. That's why I'm so confused on this."
"Hey I can chime in here!!!  I’m a guy and I once saw this happen to someone I know. I used to do Tae Kwon Do, and once at a grading ceremony one of my female instructors was doing her grading and had to carry out a complicated pattern to get her (I think) second black belt.

Anyway, mid pattern, in a WHITE Tae Kwon Do suit.... she starts bleeding. Profusely. I’m not sure if she realised it or not, but god damn that woman carried on, did her pattern perfectly, and she got her belt. 

Anyway, I was “ring side” and saw the whole thing. I thought nothing less of her, if anything I admired the woman. After she went and got changed I congratulated her on getting her belt and then I saw her thousands of times after and never once was it awkward. Of course I never mentioned it and neither did anyone else, why would you? Only someone with mental problems would bring it up. So what? The poor woman had her period at an inconvenient time? Does that make her less of a person? Of course not. These things happen.

The main thing with any situation is to own it. Face people and be done with it. No one will say anything. And if they did, then THEY would be the person who should be embarrassed. Not you. This is just one of those things, everyone has one. Some people shit themselves, some people fall and even take others with them. Don’t be afraid to say to someone “X happened and I’m so embarrassed”, that’s owning it, people will likely sympathize and comfort you, because that’s human. We all have “situations”. This too shall pass. You’ll be fine, ain’t nothing but a blimp. Go back to being bad ass."
So there is nothing I can work on? It’s just been a coincidence?
"I told him the same thing, he copes with his family issues with vaping. He says that he **has** to go through the day with a buzz. Which is terrible! I told him when I went through family issues I took care of myself. I dressed in the style I liked, did my hair the way I liked, watched movies, etc. He supposedly says when he gets his license in the fall he will drive me around when I go away to college."
Why would she say there’s a chance then? It’s borderline impossible for me to let go right now
Isn't your mother going to replace all the clothes he destroyed?

"Definitely doing something illegal.  It could be as simple as working on cars for cash after hours, but in that case he would probably tell you.  They may be running a chop shop, or moving drugs, or weapons, etc.  I think you need to insist that he tell you.  It's not ok to have a secret like that from a spouse, and if he is doing something illegal he could be putting you BOTH in danger."
"Ugh, my parents did this. It was like they forgot they were raising actual human beings and thought that we'd be good at what they mentally assigned us to be good at.  

My mom especially seemed to latch onto how we were as little kids, and kept focusing on who we were then instead of evolving her view of us as we grew up. You think it's weird having your mom be delusional about your sister's ""career"" based on what she did at 7. Wait until you keep hearing about it when she's 37. 

Both you and your sister should continue to provide each other the support that your parents won't. Your sister will eventually discover something she's good at and will need your encouragement to give it a try, especially if your mom is still harping on her about writing. She might seem unmotivated now, but she's 15 ffs. Not everyone has to be Tiger Woods. You need her encouragement and validation that you're having your own success. Tune your parents out. It's not up to them to dictate what you succeed at in life."

"He wants you to drive 30 minutes for his *addiction*, you mean.

No. Don't enable him. That's it, just no, end of conversation. Tell him you are not open to debate about it and if he keeps trying to push you, leave the conversation."
"Ahhh so it could just be I’m not a long term relationship guy, I could see that being the case. It makes me sad but if that’s it, then it’s it. Thank you"
"Yep controlling, negging.

OP its hopless just move on."
"This very well could be a misperception of what is normal, but I'm 38 now and my friends and I did all that stuff in highschool (minus the pregnancy).  We just hit a rebellious streak, she sounds like a typical 18 year old to me.  I am not a parent, but can understand just how frustrating and scary it is to go through those things, but most of the things you mentioned sound like usual teen stuff.  She's going to have a lot of growing up to do in the coming months, don't make her feel like she is alone and has no support system."
"&gt; ... as soon as you have a baby, you become wiser and capable of doing more than you ever could imagine.

Did you point right back at her mom?

Short of adoption or abortion, I think you need to come to terms with raising a baby in the near future.  Nothing you've shared about her gives any indication that she will change."
"She wrote to the sister, comparing the two siblings. So she is still comparing...

She should be able to give a pep talk to one of her children without comparing them, and thus putting one of them down."
"&gt;I can now say that I have a mental illness and that’s not my fault, but it is my responsibility. 

This is a brilliant insight. It's so easy to play the blame game and throw our hands up in the air and just say that's how we are and that's it. Well done for making so much progress, it's a hard journey."
"Sadly she's always been like this. Another reason why I would hesitate on the trip is her lack of ability to be self sufficient in terms of adulting (finding your way in airport, packing for travel properly, finding an uber/means to commute, hotel arrangements etc) 

I don't want my dad to pay for anything .. He pays enough and I would want him to save his money for retirement. 

\&gt; How does your partner feel about you paying for your sister all the time?

well it's just lunch and brunches ... So by my budget it's not much and it's not everyday. It doesn't effect me paying my bills or whatever so my partner is fine with it."
There is a good song that addresses part of this question.
Women carry this on a card in their purse. Sorta how the police carry the Miranda warning.

You need to block her, so she can't watch your stories.  You will eventually get over it.  You are hurting because you loved her while she used you."
"Do you have any sort of read on her interest in something like this? Like, it's clear you two are good friends, and the sex talk is a good sign, but that doesn't mean she wants to smash. Does she ever flirt with you? Does she touch you? Was any of the sex talk maybe her hinting at wanting to try with you?

If you're not sure at all, or haven't gotten any sort of indication from her, I would just start by initiating a bit of flirting with her. You know better than me/us what that means, but let her know you're interested in her sexually. If she responds positively/she escalates, then make it clear what you're looking for (casual thing) and go to town."
"His mother is just being ridiculous.  It doesn't sound like there's anything weird going on with you two.  But do maybe be more mindful of whether he's missing out on possible family time, and maybe keep an eye out for being too intimate in front of the family.  It's not inherently bad, but they clearly don't like it, and there's no harm in toning it down a bit."
"Could be purely coincidence. It's a ""non-answer"" like ""it's not you it's me"" (which half the time, it definitely is you).

If you're on friendly terms with any of them, it's possibly worth seeing if you can't get some constructive criticism. Make sure to make it clear that it's not a ""what do I do to get you back"" but a ""I just wanna see what I can improve for future relationships and would value your input."" If you aren't on friendly terms though, Don't bother them."

"This is a parenting decision that should involve her father and her mother.  

Her behavior problems are fifty percent her fathers parenting or lack of involvement either way he helped her get into this situation.

So now establishing the bad parenting is fifty fifty.  Yes her father should help.

This doesn’t mean raising the baby for her.  It means coming up with an independence plan for her and supporting her.  A short two year degree like nursing, MA, radiology tech, computer science would be a good goal.

Help her apply for a program and get side.  

As for the baby’s father you need to find out if he is violent or abusive before going that route.  However as your step daughter is a liar you will need to do your own checking on his character."

"It was a bit creepy but you really don't need to speak to a therapist about it.
Why do so many people overreact to stuff ?
And before you ask, I wouldn't care less if somebody said that to me.
Get over it and if she makes you feel uncomfortable then keep your distance."
"He’s not over her at all. If he was, he rouldnt he triggered by words like babe etc. 
It’s also manipulative that he blames it on you. No, ANY person with self esteem would find this unacceptable."
"I am a musician and I was working a wedding reception years ago when I noticed that a very attractive woman had bled through the back of her white dress. I moved behind her to shield her and I told 
Her what was up. 
She was leaving with me walking behind her again to shield her when several women came 
To her aid. One had a long coat that she wore to her car. She changed clothes at home I assume 
And  came back. 
My point is it’s nothing to be embarrassed 
About. It’s awkward yes but this is a situation 
Where people will help each other out. 
At least the nice people will. 
It’s a normal part of life. 
Let it go. 
If it makes you feel better I was doing a show
And my fiancé brought her mom. 
I was shit faced and I jumped off the stage 
Danced over to my soon to be mother in laws 
Table Dropped my pants and shorts 
And shook my dick in her face while I tried to 
Dance like John Travolta in Saturday night 
Fever. I was shaking my hips so my dick would 
Bounce back and forth. 
Now —- that’s embarrassing !!!!!"
"You have been tolerating animal abuse for 18 months. It’s not like you just moved in and didn’t know what was going on until just now. If you had been there for 18 days, maybe even 18 weeks then I would say it’s fair for you to have just noticed. But it shouldn’t have taken you 18 months to notice this issue and do something about it. That says you’re willing to ignore your boyfriend’s wrongdoing until it starts to affect *you*. Either that or you don’t have enough empathy to understand that yelling at an innocent creature for normal behavior is wrong. Both options are therapy worthy. You both should seek help, you boyfriend for his abusive tendencies and you for your lack of ability to see or address this abuse."
"I mean, I don't want a relationship with someone who has or wants tattoos, but it seems like your BF got into the relationship knowing you had them already. So it's not an issue of principles.

Probably a insecurity/jealousy issue. The ritual of tattooing, a man of some status permanently etching symbolic patterns of colored poison into your partner, isn't exactly comforting. IMO it fits the poly lifestyle (and the intermediate modern lifestyles) but doesn't gel with focused monogamy."

"Thankfully, the teenager has not yet gone through this major medical event so I feel pretty confident in asking: what’s stopping HER from making up some big batches of meals and freezing them before baby comes? That’ll take like, a few days tops. Why on earth should that responsibility fall on OP’s friends and family, who for all we know have their own lives and families to attend to?

If I had a friend tell me I needed to prep and deliver meals for their stepchild who is pregnant I’d be like “excuse me, what? Is she physically incapable of cooking now that she’s pregnant?”"
"There is no way in hell she will work three jobs and go to school, let’s be realistic here.
Who’s going to look after the baby? It’s not her or her husbands responsibility to help with anything she made her bed she needs to lie in it now.

Doesn’t mean that she will follow through with any of it."
"There's a lot of red flags. 

She berates you and used to break up with you weekly and come back again, etc. You are losing yourself and your self esteem. 

This sounds like a typical case of emotional abuse (i'm speaking from experience). If she won't go to therapy for this (alone), then it will stay in that unhealthy dynamic forever. 

It would also be healthy to check which part of that unhealthy dynamic is you (it always takes two people to keep a dynamic like this going, you are probably enabling her behaviour)."
Thank you. :)
You handled it better than most would and should feel good about it.
If ray says he will kill himself then let those empty words ride. He is manipulating you into staying.
"We spend $2000 including the honeymoon on our wedding, we had it upstairs in a pub, immediate family and friends and at lunch time.  We had several snack platters a bar tab, I had my mums wedding dress, for sentimental reasons but it did cut down on the cost.  After the wedding we had a hotel honeymoon suite, and for the honeymoon we had a DOC (it is our department of conservation) cabin on top of a mountain and spend 2 weeks reading books, going to the hot pools and snowboarding.

I agree. Maybe I'm overthinking a scenario which hasn't happened yet...
For real... my ex was like this. Unemployed and lazy. Looking back at it now it was such a waste of time. I'm with someone now that already plans adventures weeks in advance. OP you're so young just find someone else that will treat you like a queen - they're out there!!
"I think you're taking the right step. This is a good moment to evaluate what you can learn from your behaviour in this relationship. Of course you can best determine this yourself but two lessons seem clear to me:

1. Set your boundaries early and clearly, before you become very frustrated. It will also be easier for a partner to change behaviour and expectations when they have not become ingrained.

2. It's not healthy for one partner to structurally make a significantly larger effort. You might want to read up on codependent relationships.

Best of luck with your future romantic relationships!"
"Same old story. Someone who seriously needs to google determinism. 

Stop blaming your SD for ‘her choices’. She is nothing but the random genetics and experiences she got lumped with and could not be or do anything other than she has done and will do / has been and will be. Your blame is irrational and unjust."
"Did you imply your ex knew your boyfriend was out of town or I misread that? Also, since your email exchange has been superficial these past months (you didn’t even mention being in a new relationship), I don’t see why it needed a face to face encounter to discuss the issue."
Contact child protective services if you feel that his basic needs are not being met.
Thanks for this. I know it should be that easy. I'm just scared if I anger her by moving out then I'll lose all (emotional) support from her.
"I assume that's revenue, not profit. Probably actually making 10-20% of that."
He knows deep down that he doesnt measure up to you. He has to believe hes better in someway because hes an insecure ass.
"I’m really sorry to tell you this, but trying to “find yourself“ for the sake of your relationship is not going to work. And it definitely will not work in one week.

Also, out of pure curiosity, do you think a break is a normal thing in a romantic relationship?"
"Try making yourself more valuable/desirable: like going to the gym (more often), getting new clothes, not hitting on her or not pressuring her anymore. It's not sure that it will work but it would be beneficial to you in the long term. Work on yourself and follow your dreams and let things fall in place naturally. If that doesn't work, then you can move on while also being a better person."
"And all the text effects. That shit gotta spin, fade in, flash, and bounce!!"
"Perhaps you do it because for their family you're a positive reminder of Jessie. You could just be doing this for their family and not really for yourself. To provide them comfort. I mean, I don't know... you were their at the funeral so you must be more connected with them because you saw them express grief and remorse and you kind of just stuck with them.

I think it would be selfish for your current gf to get angry about you being friends with them. Maybe not selfish but she just lacks the right perspective. Even if you were talking about Jessie, she's dead, I mean, how could you want to date someone that is dead or be interested in a girl who is dead, and you could still argue that it's to help Jessie's family deal with the fact that she died."
"I have to check. I think my gf planted some shit like that, but she will not stop coming into the house with string beans. It's insane. It's a 3 foot by 21 foot area of beans. I don't remember what she planted though, it was definitely something like basil or parsley or something along those lines. I'm in it for the tomatoes, peppers, and onions, but mostly the habeneros. Little bastards are hot."
Regardless of how he's acting.. 35 year old with a 24 year old. That's some serious red flags there on both sides.
You're right on the money when you say it's means of control. This is pure negging. The dude has worked hard to convince her she will never find better than him roaming around the house in his filthy boxer shorts.
From your replies it seems they’re the losers and you’re the winner. I’d be proud of you.
"She is deeply against that. I asked her to do it really often, for physical and mental health (she has extreme pain during her period up to a point where she is fainting, and she had one of her ovaries removed because of a cyst, but the pain continued. She only had the cyst removed after she had to be brought to a hospital because of her pain, and this time she couldn't let it wait out. I think maybe she has more issues, and maybe also some hormonal problems?

&amp;#x200B;

For mental, yeah she has had eating disorders, panic attacks, fear of dark... but i can't get her to tell me why she doesn't want to see anyone, it's free where we live."
So glad something worked out for you in the end :) Did you ever end up meeting the jerk who stood you up irl or did you just text? It’s his loss for being shit to you 🤷🏻‍♀️  Also if you don’t mind me asking how old are you now? My preferred age range for a fwb right now is close to my age haha. I think I’m going to try to lay off for a while. Thank you!
It does and that's completely fair. Thank you for your honesty.
"This is a great answer.

Frankly, this is a textbook example of why abortion and adoption are good things. But there’s no way to tell someone to do it - they have to come up with the idea themselves, in their own time. The only thing that might work is by making the baby “real” - helping to give an understanding of what it requires in terms of a single parent."
"I think you have to prioritise your husbands very real, very damaging effect that your father is having on him, over some theoretical guilt you might feel in some theoretical situations down the track.

Plus, its completely up to your dad, its not like you took that decision away from him, but the opposite. You are giving him the decision if he wants these people in his life or not."
"See if there’s anyway you can get a loan or payment plan for your schools tuition. If not you may have to take a break from  school for one semester. Either way, tell your parents you want to help them out but you need to get through school first. Until then they need to figure out on their own how to stay afloat. Tell them you need to be able to live there rent free so you can save up for school. Once you get your degree you’ll be making more money than everyone in the house combined. (Assuming of course you major in something with high job prospects)"
"You are basically describing my girlfriend and me, a year or so ago.

I mainly have one advice - STAND YOUR GROUND. Do things your way even if she complains. Otherwise you will eventually lose self-confidence and will hate yourself for being walked all over. Explain to your gf that you like doing X activity your way and she should stop criticizing you as it's damaging to you and your relationship. If she tells you that you never listen, tell her she always criticizes you and this is slowly driving a wedge between the two of you. Be firm. Get into an argument if you need to. Rinse and repeat.

She will be stubborn at first as she's used to getting things her way, but I repeat - STAND YOUR GROUND. You will need to be very patient with her while you're doing this, as the process of her mellowing out and letting go of her controlling behaviour takes time.

If she doesn't compromise, you don't compromise either. If she complains just tell her that she doesn't compromise, that relationships are a two way street, and her criticizing you is a sure way to end the relationship. Tell her you will be doing X your way.

The goal is for her to be as tolerant of your behaviour as you are of hers.

&gt;In terms of household things I do more of the day to day things 90% of the cooking, more of the laundry, cleaning up the kitchen. She'll do more of the bigger once every couple of weeks once a month things. It's probably 60% to her 40%

This is not good and it sounds like you're doing much more than 90%. It sounds like she doesn't really respect you. The chores should be shared between the two of you as evenly as possible, What are the bigger things she does?

From an outsider's view, she tells you what to do and how to do it and then you do it. It sounds pretty emasculating. I really doubt she finds this attractive and is doing it just for her ego.

Stand up for yourself. Divide the chores evenly. Do things your way. Make compromises but only if she makes them as well."
"Exactly this. If it wasn't about creativity it'd be about something else. If you were a rising-star artist and he a scientist he'd be making digs at your crazy mind and flighty nature. You dress like a toddler, you're not gonna change the world like I am, you'll never be financially stable, sure the world needs art but not nearly as much as it needs science... he needs you to be Less Than him. He's so goddamn insecure he even needs his friends to back him up while he disses his girlfriend."
"&gt; With that said, she shouldn't have pushed to have you fuck her after it was clear her husband was uncomfortable. 

Because her role is just to be the f*ck toy in her husbands dirty little fantasy? Her husband pushed and pressured for this while forgetting the cardinal rule of sex: **if it isn't a hell yeah, it is a no!**"
"There’s no perfect answer or instant fix. Definitely remove things from your life that you can live without that remind you of him. Identify potential shortcomings (not things he didn’t like but areas you believe you can improve) and work on those. Become the best version of yourself and do things you enjoy and you’ll miss the right person at the right time, guaranteed"

"Your husband should understand that, as much as he wants to go back home on train and so getting home later than he could, you should be able too to ask for some time alone"
"Keep in mind that a lot of friendships in your early twenties simply don't last. No reason to take it personal, it gets less impactful when you come to accept that people constantly change and evolve and those golden memories don't usually feel the same way years later. I've had people from my past show up years later and we mutually discover we have nothing in common anymore - there's no hostility to it, just the way things can be sometimes."
"You’re not going to find your identity in a week. Nothing substantial is going to change in a week. By all means, use this time to start to work towards self improvement, but it’s also time to prepare yourself to be single (where you can really make strides toward finding yourself). A ‘break’ is just the beginning of the end of a relationship."
You handled it perfectly. There is no need to go and meet someone you have no intention of maintaining a relationship with.
"Wow...

You both knew the chance when you recorded yall fucking. You can apologize all you want but its ultimately up to them."
"I guess you're right, i agree.

Just can't shake the feeling shes doing wrong and she's causing herself hurt. Like you say though, i've said what i think and need to leave it to her now.."
"Parents are financially abusive OP. Your situation tough buddy. I recommend this tho

Most important: 1. Talk to your college admission officer at your situation. Apply for students loans. You need to finish college as this is your ticket way out of your parents if you don't have any other ideas. 

2. Ask friends/relatives to give you some cash as you are in a desperate position. Just pay them back as soon as you get your paycheck. 

Right now, it is a hopeless situation and its alright to cry about it. Let your frustrations out. Please be alright OP. 

Also, if you ever plan on moving out, I think it would be best if you also get your younger brother. Don't let him suffer too."
Hair doesn’t increase smell.
Sorry if that’s a bit graphic... but I felt it was warranted.
"You might get more money out of Fasfa if you explain what's going on. Also I'd look into applying for emergency food stamps and food banks for groceries. You won't get your food stamps taken away if you have fasfa until the semester is over (at least in certain states, if your in the US)."

"Your parents are financially abusing you. Their choices and careers are not something you have had any control or responsibility for and it’s not up to you to support them. 


1. Appeal to your college. Explain that there is a financially abusive situation going on at home and ask if there are any resources or supports which they can offer students. 


2. Find somewhere else to live. In the mean time only pay the 250. Pay for your own groceries and keep a record of everything, keep all receipts. Speak with your credit card company and bank to make sure your accounts are in your name, password protected and your credit is locked down so neither of your parents can open lines of credit in your name. Make sure your important documents- passport, birth certificate, college info, banking info- is safely locked away. 


3. Speak to a lawyer, find out what your legal position is. 


4. Do not give them any more money. This is the hardest one but they have no right to all your money and you need to stop giving it to them. Right now they are leeching off you rather than find a solution to their money issues, causing you to be mentally and emotionally exhausted and they keep extorting money from you under the guise of ‘family’. They are toxic. I’m so sorry but your parents have been abusing you and your brother for a long time and it’s only going to continue until you leave. Until then cut them off financially- they are ruining you and they don’t care because it’s easier to hurt you than work for the money themselves."
"Seems pretty counterintuitive to trash on someone that doesn't normally give gifts when they finally give you one.

I wouldn't be giving my BF gifts anytime soon if they reacted the way you do. Granted, I'm definitely a ""it's the thought that counts"" kind of girl."
You’re right. Whenever I get to really thinking about it I remember how mad I was at the time and when it was actually going on because how can you be mad at me when all I’m doing it agreeing with our friend that she shouldn’t have to wake up at 5 to drive you to work every day. Whenever I’m in my day to day I occasionally will miss her but once I wrote this out and started reading comments I remembered that I can’t blame myself for this.
"Because despite this happening before we got together, i've seen how its affected her. Certain things will make her upset even if they are unrelated because its reminds her of the situation. Even if i playfully say ""stop lying"" if i think shes had the last packet of crisps or something she turns on me because they wrongly called her a liar which had a hugely negative effect on her whole old social group. How sensitive she is to all of it is just going to bring it all to the forefront and i expect lots of tears.

I've had similar happen to me in the past. I deal with it by saying ""fuck 'em"" in my head and live my life with the people that matter and treat me well."
"Good point. If his unemployment is temporary, OP could give a « dog budget » of a year as a gift? Or OP’s parents could? Or they could get a family dog which could become OP’s bro’s dog? Or they could foster?"

For what reason do you only get 4 to 5 hours of sleep each night?
"This is an extra 10 hours a week for your daughter without a parent around. That's a lot.

It sounds like you have a shitty coparent. You should work to get him to compromise. Why can't he drive home a few days a week to see your daughter earlier? Likewise, and equally, why can't you do workouts 2 times a week and then go home to see your daughter the other nights? But ultimately your kid is the priority. Even if your coparent continues to be shitty, it doesn't mean you should do the same. Your kid shouldn't be sacrificed so casually.

By no means do I think parents should be martyrs BUT young children need their parents. I have a 2.5 year old son and work full time. Most of my workouts happen while he is napping on the weekend or once a week I might go to an evening yoga class while he's with his father. Once in a while if I have the energy I workout after my son has gone to sleep. That's my me time. I have it, but it is not my top priority because at this vulnerable young age obviously my son has to be my main priority. It's biology. Toddlers don't know about 'me time' and work and commuting. They only know when they don't see their parents enough.

Sure, I miss the freedom I had before having a kid, but I don't miss it nearly as much as I enjoy spending time with him. Of course some times/hours are difficult - toddlers can be draining! - but even then I remember that my being there for the drudgery is part of what makes him happy and secure most of the time. He knows he is loved and he knows where is parents are and that they love spending time with him. He feels wanted. 

I don't know much about older kids, but I can imagine in a year or two your daughter will already be way more independent than she is now. Why not give her a little more time before you jump back into the full swing of your workout routine? Maybe I'm naive, but personally I've got age 6 marked out as a time where either my kid will want a little more of his own me time or he'll have enough of a social life that I might get more convenient me time. Until then, I'm happy to prioritize him because this is a one shot deal."
"Like my original post said: he was more than okay and into it until he finished. That’s the moment things became weird. I asked him at that point if he wanted us to stop and he still said no.... but his words and his body language said two separate things. One of my many big conflicting moments in that moment were to follow his body language and stop and make his wife feel like a useless sex toy for the two of us, ignore him and do what her and I wanted and have sex with her to completion, or just do what I did and find a middle ground where everyone feels like they kinda won, kinda lost..... idk if that makes sense."
"Friends don't stay over for rain.  Snow, maybe, but rain, unless it is a hurricane, no chance. 

How did you suffocate him in the past?  Did you hang out with your friends on a regular basis?

Friends don't spend that much time at each residences, and this is speaking from experience.  

He has probably checked out but is too afraid to confront it."
"Ty normally I’d agree, but I had checked out long before emotionally... I have no feelings there unfortunately and I’m ready to date. I can be single and date..."
How do I convince him of that?
I feel like so many men don't know this information at all. And it's so important.
I’ve been in a different kind of situation where I quickly stopped being friends with my best friend. It sucks when you go from seeing and talking to each other constantly to nothing. In my situation it felt like we grew apart in a matter of seconds. I’ll occasionally wonder what I could’ve done differently or how she’s feeling and hope she’s happy. I had to stop myself from constantly checking her social media whenever I was bored. I did reach out in the beginning but it was always weird. I think it’s important to remember that if people want you in their lives then they will try to make it happen in some way.
"I’d go for it and have some fun. If things get serious down the road then it can be dealt with then. If you like him maybe go out and have a drink with him and see if it goes anywhere? And as for a response, personally I’d go with something like, “ I like strange, and I’m glad now that I’m single I can tell you how cute I’ve always thought you were :)” something playful and light and also letting him know you have always been a fan of his."
"Save and spend the amount you're comfortable with. Dont take out a loan. 

If you want friends and family present dont do a destination wedding unless you're paying for everyones hotels."
"Thank you, i know the giving nudes is a bad thing but i know for sure its not some old guy. 

I think you are right i think its for the best if we break up, ther is no clean way out but its for the best as you say."
"&gt; But think about a couple things, why are you posting this shit to reddit to begin with? What is the end goal? Do you think any of us are going to know how to deal with this guy? Do you think any of us know who he is? Or that we can trust what you're saying is fair and unbiased?


Uh, this is r/relationships. This is a subreddit specifically for people to seek outside perspective on their relationships."
"Hate to say this but it sounds like you were always lower class, you probably just weren’t below the poverty line until now. Certainly, your parents at least weren’t asking you to chip in before you had the ability to work. 

As another person in a low income family, it’s not uncommon to be asked to help pay for rent after you are able to work. I spent a long time being bitter that my parents choices led me to having to help my mom afford to live, but it’s something that I had to come to terms with on my own time ( I also realized down the line my parents did their best to get an education, my dad was the first one in his family to get a HS diploma). 

I wasn’t living at home and paying rent while in college, but I did completely support myself and send home money when I could. I did this thanks to qualifying for the max amount of federal loans and grants and taking out additional private loans. Lumni is an income based loan service that doesn’t require a co-signer, they let me take out $7000 in my senior year. You can take out more than you need for tuition in loans and then use the remaining money to pay for rent and groceries in addition to the money you make working. It sucked none the less, especially because the people I met in college weren’t in the same financial situation as me. 

Putting yourself in debt is stressful and awful, but it’s the only way to elevate your class status. Help out your family as you can, make getting your degree the top priority, and get a job as soon as you can out of college"
"OP, maybe it's time to accept that your body is perfectly fine and works as it should and that the issue is more a problem of your boyfriend. You have acceptable routines and your doctor says everything works as it should. Shaving is a personal preference, for some trimming works better, but it has nothing to do with how clean you are. Perhaps... your BF is just wrong about how vaginas should smell and look like and it's his problem to deal with. Don't cater to him anymore, it doesn't seem to do you good."
"I'm in pretty much the same situation. I moved interstate, have been with my boyfriend two years and still dont really have any friends. And mind you, I'm an extrovert, totally love meeting people. But I just get to nervous to reach out to people for friendship. So I totally get how you're feeling. I cant offer advice but I can let you know youre not alone! Adult friendships are so difficult  so dont put too much pressure on yourself"
"Dude, you are fine.  Just give them some space for a little while.  Your friend obviously liked the idea of his fantasy more than the actual act, and his wife was (somewhat justifiably) upset that even though she was reluctant to take part initially, once your friend was finished he had no interest in having her finish playing out the fantasy.  With that said, she shouldn't have pushed to have you fuck her after it was clear her husband was uncomfortable.  

They need to sort this out between themselves, but if they are reasonable they'll both understand where everyone else was coming from and things should largely go back to normal.  Just don't bring it up or push the issue yourself, its really none of your business unless they make things awkward with you."
"Yeah that's what I figured too... husband can read at home at night; wife can work out when kid's in the bed (because husband is at home reading). Seems like a fairly easy solution, but both don't really sound all too enthusiastic about family time :P"

"Update #2: hey @everyone.  
This post got much more attention than I initially intended for, and I'm thankful for it. Some really interesting and eye-opening insights here.

So, yesterday night I talked to my bf about it. I told him I created this post and that it got lots of responses, most of them really helpful. I introduced the idea of rehoming our dog, pointing out that maybe our home is not the best environment for our dog, plus bringing up the fact that my bf wasn't planning on having a dog for so long, to begin with, and he got caught up in this situation with an ""unplanned"" dog, taking care of it by himself (whereas it was supposed to be him and his ex-husband, hadn't the latter fled out of the country), a dog that by nature is energetic and expansive... **and** on top of that having to deal with his own anxiety in the middle of this hurricane.

I pointed out that the current situation was not fair on our dog (for obvious reasons), not fair on my bf (since he was clearly pushing a situation that was only making it worse every day and not addressing the real source of it), and also not fair on me (since I get caught up in his anxiety attacks caused by the dog and get blamed for it without reason).

I said that rehoming seemed like the best option, and that it didn't mean he failed the dog: we just realised we are not able to give our dog what he truly needs, and that is okay. He didn't reject my idea, but also seemed thoughtful about it. I told him he didn't need to decide straight away, but he should process it and see how he feels about it.

I think I'll try to tackle the subject again tonight, and keep you guys posted.

Once again, thank you for all your responses and insights, they were (and are) very helpful."
"Man, i was half way through reading that"
Okay. Firstly vagina's are hairy. If you like your hair or don't like shaving that is absolutely fucking fine. Secondly vagina's don't smell like roses. Ever. That being said. If your suddenly having a change in how your vagina smells and it's BAD. Like fishy or super strong that is a problem go see a doctor. If you have normal healthy vagina stink then guess what that's normal and healthy and your boyfriend sounds like an immature child. Also discharge is normal. If you want to keep the child as a partner maybe educate him.
"yep thank you for your help, I will try too break up as nice as i can. 

But i know it will still hurt but its for the best."
i live in an area where rent for the smallest apartment i could find was 750~. im hoping to get a fresh start and start properly saving again. just making sure its all steady and that i have my own car first before i move out because unfortunately i use their car too.
"I am going to be frank with you, this whole situation is sketchy. The setup, the discussion, the rules. None of that is present. You guys, with a standing relationship, talked less about this than I did with a couple that I met while on holiday. Before we had even left the bar, we had discussed who was comfortable touching who, what was on the table and what was not, safe words and stop words. 

Honestly though, none of this is your problem. Your friend setup up his fantasy and found out (shock horror) that the reality is very, very different. The outcome of this is undoubtedly a very long and serious conversation between him and his wife. For you, if this every comes up again, I would strongly urge you to decline."
It most certainly has. She hated the thought of me being with another girl and it was probably the most contentious part of my last relationship.
"Overall, he's making it about him and I think it's because he has anxiety. When escalated he won't see the logic that you informed him your phone was flat.

Stand your ground. You've done nothing wrong. He probably felt left out and a bit jealous maybe?"
Ngl that hurts a little haha. Reality is a bitch
"Bless them, their heart is in the right place."
"This is probably one of the greatest pieces of advice I’ve ever received. I for sure would die if my daughter were miserable like I was. So thank you for this, put new perspective for me."
"It’s lovely that you keep in touch with them. *They lost their child* for god’s sake. For you to stay in touch means they at least get to watch you have a life that she will never get to live. It’s small, and it’s not the same as having her at all, but it’s a kindness for you to stay in touch. And for your girlfriend to be jealous of this says an ENORMOUS amount about her character - none of it good. She should think it’s lovely. Unless you have a shrine to your ex built in your living room, she should be absolutely fine with it."
"Your boyfriend told you that he is disappointed in you for being afraid at being driven about at high speeds without a helmet???? Because YOU should be disappointed in HIM for taking you out without one to begin with! 

Your boyfriend is a huge fucking asshole, honestly. How dare he be angry at you for ""not trusting his driving""?!?! It's not a personal insult to him that you want to follow common sense safety protocols. God he actually told you that he would dump you over this if you hadn't been dating as long, as if you ought to grateful to him for oh so generously giving you another chance!

Don't date people who endanger your safety. Don't date people who are mean to you."
"Based on what you have said, I'm not sure it is love he felt so much as obsession; and when those feelings fizzled he became obsessed with another girl and chose to cut you completely out of his life to avoid reminding himself of it.  I'd be relieved he moved on.  It's gonna be hard to get over him, but you'll feel stronger having emerged from it and increasing your self-reliance."
"Booked my trip! He told me he was afraid I'd feel left out; these people aren't my friends, they're his. I'm sure he'll have a lovely time without me."
[removed]
"It sounds like you two aren't compatible, but I also used to blame my boyfriends for being ""boring"" and used it as a way to not take responsibility for my life.

Schedule things you want to do. Have fun with your friends. Tell him he can come along if he wants. If he wants to, great. If he doesn't, no loss. This is your life and you only get one of it. You can still have lazy days where you watch TV but you should probably tell him you're unsatisfied and instead of forcing him to change, you're going to take the initiative. You may find that you're happier without him doing this, but maybe he'll become more interested in doing the kind of things you want."
"I totally get why you feel embarrassed. I believe a great percentage of the women population have at least one ""embarrassing"" story related to their period. I, for example have a quite a few similar to yours. I had a leak on my mother in law's car once and another in my ex boyfriend's car (he was already my ex at that moment and I wanted to die out of embarrassment). I've come to the conclusion that these situations will happen because even if we take all the measures necessary to prevent an accident of this type it can still happen and it's ready out of our control since heavy flows are sometimes unexpected. But as someone commented here previously, people are sympathetic to you. Don't worry about it! It's natural and I'm sure they'll understand."
"So here's the deal. They didn't mention it. Meaning, you get a free pass. You also don't mention it because think about it: there is nothing you can do to change what happened. Of course you feel embarrassed. But in the end, there's nothing you can do. Now your choice is to fret and feel terrible--understandable, but ultimately useless, or just accept it and move on. So chalk it up to one bit of bad luck, smile, and venture forth to see them again. This will fade into the background--IF they even noticed. Don't worry! Deep breath and move forward!"
"I've always followed this rule and tell others about it.  It's simple.  If someone is interested in you, they will make time and they WILL make it known.  People will lose out on social events and sleep to spend time with someone they want"
"Like writing a letter , but not sending it, to straighten it out in your mind"
"Thanks, I'm glad someone else noted this.  

OP, please read through this sub, it might help you gain some insight and how to deal with narcissistic parenting. There is also a wealth of knowledge about the topic on YouTube. 

Do NOT give up your writing and do NOT let others steal your enjoyment of it either."
What even is this train wreck
"You should read about NPD (narcissistic personality disorder), and check out the Narcissistic abuse subreddit (I dont know how to link to it).  You two are still very young, so it could be immaturity on his part as well, but I would read about the NPD for sure.  Gives you a lot of information to know what to watch out for in the future as well.  Best of luck to you."
"Don't feel bad! Oh man, yesterday was all coloring for me and your 5 to  a 9 sounds about right! I was done by the end.

Haha sometimes when people post stories about their pets, people will say ""cat tax or dog tax"", suggesting the OP must post a pic of their pet as tax for talking about them. I'm attempting to do the same :p

Glad you realize this. Do not let him justify his behavior, get mad or turn things around on you. If the conversation doesn't end with him apologizing and acknowledging he needs help, do yourself a favor and end things"
"Okay cool :) thanks for your thoughts. I really don’t mind not being sober sometimes, but I also just like to get to know people when they’re sober as well as not, so that was my thinking. If he’s not cool with it I’m sure he’ll just tell me and we can figure it out from there."
"What is the objective of giving him the gift? If any part of you wants it to aide in getting back with him you may be setting yourself up for disappointment. If you are completely sure that you are just doing it to be kind then feel free to give it to him. It's like any other gift in a way, if you are giving it with expectations then you are doing it for the wrong reasons."
I know and it kills me. He thinks because I have a professional career and hang out with more mature settled down people that they are lame and boring and I think his crowd is reckless and immature. He compared me to other people in his group or who he's dated and said that no one else had a problem with it and I was overreacting. I just can't believe who he is right now. He just is so great in so many other ways it's so difficult to decide what to do. What would you do?
I think I see where your SD’s decision-making skills come from. No wonder she’s flailing.
Honestly sounds like the friends brother has the issue here if he is the one that initially pushed your bf across the room and them punched a hole in the wall. It's hard to know who was the true aggressor but from what you say he seems to be the aggressor.
"I’m sorry that happened to you, and it’s understandable you feel humiliated. Honestly, I don’t think his family would judge you for that. Would you judge another woman for leaking? It happens sometimes, it’s life. We bleed every month for ~40 years, it would be a miracle to never have an accident. Its nothing to be ashamed of, and it will likely all be swept under the rug and they’ll move on and get to know you as if it never happened. If you get close with them you’ll probably have a laugh about it one day. Sometimes when things like this happen it feels like a huge deal and like you’ll never move past it... then a week later you already feel better and it’s behind you. A few months from now it’ll be in the past, and I’m sure you’ll feel way better about it. It’s just very fresh right now. 

Also his mother or sisters will be very understanding, they deal with it too, and his dad has probably seen his mom poop herself while pushing babies out of her vagina SO. Don’t feel ashamed about your normal bodily functions. I’m sure if you talked about it with your partner and expressed how embarrassed you’re feeling he would also reassure you."
His group is reckless and immature and mine is mature and professional and settled down and he thinks they're lame. He compared me to other people in his group or who he's dated and said that no one else had a problem with it and I was overreacting. I just can't believe who he is right now. He just is so great in so many other ways it's so difficult to decide what to do. What would you do?
"I guess life always has problems we just have to pick our problems. I think maybe I need to stick up for myself more and not let him guilt me because of my anxiety and depression, he uses it as a scapegoat for the things he has done wrong in our relationship. Thats not to say it hasn't been true sometimes but I've always apologized after."
"I honestly don't know how buying a car works so the lease was my words and confusing myself with how buying a car works. All I know is her mom bought the car with her insurance under her Mom's name, but the bank is refinancing her somehow. But yes I completely agree she needs to leave."
If all goes good you’ll be laughing at it next family dinner
"I was going to say this, that poor dog."
"It sounds like the whole family needs to sit down together in one room and talk about what’s going to happen. Everyone, especially your SD, ESPECIALLY if it’s still early enough for her to change her mind about abortion, needs to be on the same page about who’s really willing to do what and who really expects what."
"This is a tough situation to say much about from the outside. I admire your self-awareness and your openness to the possibility that it’s a “you” issue.

Sometimes people really just rub you the wrong way. You recognize that your continued interactions with the new person will negatively impact the group and I get wanting to pull away from the whole. Maintain those individual friendships, though, and make plans with small groups if you want to continue spending time with them. 

Good luck."
"You're not being a jerk. This sounds exactly like me with my ex. I spoke to him about it and suggested we do some fun things (rather than sitting at home doing nothing every waking moment of our lives). He didnt seem to be keen on that, so I broke up with him and I'm so much happier now. Bear in mind I think hes a great person, we just clashed in a lot of ways and I felt restricted and it was the best way out. If he is willing to make an effort and give you more space, though, the breakup wont be necessary. If you're both willing, you can fix it just by spicing it up a little - like I tried to. Hopefully itll work out better for you :)"
And that person enters into the web.  The web set as a trap.
Is he an ex now? Because he seems fucked up.
[removed]
"I’m feeling sorrier and sorrier for your SD the more you comment. It sounds like she’s been set up to fail. 

Nevertheless, be firm and consistent in your boundaries with her. Decide now how often you’re willing to babysit her child, and what the rules will be for doing so (make sure they’re adjustable as the kid ages, too much rigidity won’t be fun for anyone). Decide how much financial help you’ll be willing to give SD, and what (realistic) conditions she’ll need to meet to receive it. Figure out what your dealbreakers are and make sure you and your husband agree on them. Be the consistent (and reliable) presence your SD and pending grandchild will need - they should always know what to expect from you, and that you’ll never move the goalposts without good reason and fair warning. Treat her like an adult, but tap into enough empathy to set her up for success. Give her goals you know she can meet, and at least *some* praise for meeting them. It sounds like she gets very little positive reinforcement OR good advice from her mother. If you’re patient and willing, you could still make a significant difference for her without giving too much of yourself to a boundary-challenged person."

"&gt;Why not call the office if you're THAT worried? 

ding ding ding

&gt;So many things that I just don't understand really. I have no idea what to do with this situation and he won't back down.

What exactly does he want you to do here? You can't go back in time and get your phone charged. No more than he can go back in time and call the shop. 

You need to tell him to let this go or he can go and *mean* it. If you choose to stay, this is a defining moment to set boundaries and exert standards of expected behavior from him that he must abide by and if he doesn't, you will not tolerate it. Including but not limited to, off the rip he needs to stop with all the screaming, yelling, and accusations. If you don't do this or if he doesn't agree to it, best believe this is only the start of the misery this man will inflict on you. 

&gt;I do understand why he was worried

No, you really don't. If you understood the craziness in his head you would run for the hills STAT. If this man was genuinely worried for you in the usual manner, like regarding your safety, he would have called the shop. End of story. No, what he was worried about was that you were doing the old sit 'n spin on the tattoo artist or something else nefarious and defamatory to your character. That is what he thinks of you, that is what this is all about. If I were you I'd kick him to the curb so fast his head would spin."
"Your boyfriend needs actual therapy. This is beyond the dog, this is a triggering situation all around."

The friend claims that he had asked my boyfriend whether he had told me.
"Become a best selling author (I think you are on your way) and then mail the book to your parents with a dedication “thank you for not believing in me, you made me a better writer”
Boing!"
Sigh! It’s from the admin person from another department thanking me for helping them out. Really sweet but jammed me up for sure!

How did he know your boyfriend did or didn’t say anything when he decided it’d been long enough and he was going to tell you? That would’ve been a private conversation between you and your boyfriend and he wouldn’t have been aware of it unless you’d decided to break up with him.
"You are not responsible for their emotional reaction to your stating boundaries. 

If your housmate is making you feel unsafe, consider talking to the landlord about it, unless you have landowner rights."
No harm in asking if he'd sell it back to you
That's a pretty dangerous gamble. This is a human being we are talking about.
"You and your SO sound amazing. I would have loved to have a village because that is what your SD has to help her with this child. I had my first son at 15 and my mother didn't help with anything, I mean nothing and made me feel horrible throughout my pregnancy but letting me know what a disappointment I was and that I wouldn't amount to anything in life  Now, if you decide that, you will obviously ruin your relationship. You mentioned the baby's father that will be in the picture, does his family know? Are they contributing in some way? I never went after my SO when we first had our son but he and his family provided almost everything, diapers, formula, clothes. 

If that is something they are thinking of doing than the child support may not be necessary. 

Like I said, you sound like you are doing everything in your power to support her, while keeping in mind this is her child and setting boundaries and there is nothing wrong with that. She'll come around."
He compared me to other people in his group or who he's dated and said that no one else had a problem with it and I was overreacting. I just can't believe who he is right now. He just is so great in so many other ways it's so difficult to decide what to do. What would you do? I just don't know how I can forgive him without him giving me a true apology. He also doesn't want to have any more discussion about it when he gets back and just wants us to work things out better in the future
"Your boyfriend's friend is racist and your boyfriend enables him. Do you REALLY want to be with someone like that? Your boyfriend doesn't respect you at all and that's exactly why his friends don't respect you either.

You dated for 6 months and moved in together? Next time, please wait at least 1.5 years."
I dont know why i thought asking the internet for advice would help lol all you did was start your comment off with assumptions. She works a desk job 4 days a week. I live with her she does nothing. She literally doesn't burn the calories in secret lol she is glued to the ps4 from the time she gets home to the time she goes to work/bed. I dont feel like you read some of my post as o STATED I have lost the weight before but maintaining it is difficult because i need support and i dont have it. Which is why i want her to be supportive.
You had to ask him about it before he told you.
"This definitely is the route I want to take and I’ve explained that to my bf. I know I’m a great girlfriend and will be to someone else one day, but I have a lot of deep rooted issues that I need to fix, and there’s a lot of respect and love I need to give myself first. I know if I was mentally stronger I wouldn’t have been in this mess in the first place.  Im at a point in my life where I want to be selective with who I’m bringing into my life, not just being with anyone who shows me 10% attention. 

Guess the daddy issues mixed with the traumatizing childhood was gonna come back to haunt me one day lol. 

But thank you for your advice ❤️"
"He knew you were busy and it's impractical to expect updates every hour. It's not your job to fix his excessive anxiety and he needs professional help.

It sounds like he's making your mental health a lot worse and you really don't need this shit in your life. You need stability and someone who can help alleviate your stress, not cause it. I'd really consider whether the relationship truly makes you happy or not."
"Hmm, I didn’t think about it like that (I think largely because I’ve never been in this situation before). I guess you’re right, I just like this guy so was trying to figure out how it could potentially work. Thanks for the advice!"
"I just find it hard to believe a phone battery can't last half a day. And if you knew your battery was shot why not tell him like ""ill text you every 2 hours or so so my battery doesn't die."" Point being to work with him so you're not tied to your phone and he still gets his update. 

Basically, if this guy is as horrible as you're making him out to be then I don't know why you're with him because it really sounds like you don't like him and you just want validation. 

But think about a couple things, why are you posting this shit to reddit to begin with? What is the end goal? Do you think any of us are going to know how to deal with this guy? Do you think any of us know who he is? Or that we can trust what you're saying is fair and unbiased? 

But whatever, skip all that. At the end of the day, you're with him for some reason. Whether hes actually nice, or you don't feel like being alone. Whatever. If he's important to you, and you know he has this anxiety problem, why would you treat the situation like that? Why not break up the tattoo and just go another day like almost everyone else does? Imagine if he said ""ill be home at 9"" then shows up at 11? 

You both have anxiety, and everyone is suppose to be sympathetic about your anxiety with the tattoo and getting it done but not his about you acting shady? 

It's just dumb. I don't think hes an angel, or hes in the right. I just think everyone is freaking out at him without looking at your shit that you're doing. But again, if hes as horrible as you say he is, then leave him and go find someone else who won't care when you're two hours late and then hang up on them when they're talking to you."

"Sounds like she might be emotionally unfaithful. Don’t get visibly mad because that will make things worse, but definitely make it clear that you’re uncomfortable with it. If she can’t respect that, then it might be time to question the relationship."
"That sounds awful, Cheese. I hope you have emerged as unscathed as possible."
It's so hard because he an I have been single for years and then fell for each other so easy. He has all of the other core values that no one else had. I have had nothing but bad experiences dating guys who lied and cheated and were sexist. I'm not sure if I will ever meet someone else who treats me in the good ways that he does.

Because it was a spiteful suspicious things to do. I would not want the packing of all my wordly possessions to be totally out of my hands and in the hands of someone who seemingly suddenly wanted to end our relationship.
"You've said your piece. There's nothing more you can or should do. 

She lost her dad *three weeks ago*. Of *course* she's clinging hard to someone who reminds her of him and who remembers him fondly from when they were kids. Let her be defensive of this friendship right now, and don't say 'I told you so' when RM inevitably acts like a jerk again."
"Sounds like he's potentially interested in you. This other girl could be a partner, a friend, or a short-term fling. You don't know at the moment. I'd maintain contact, maybe a little more loosely, and try not to create any expectations around a future relationship until you've actually been on a date or several."
"Is your uncle your mother's brother (and not your dad's brother)? If so, I think there's a pattern there that you're not going to get much sympathy or support for your emotions. In fact, your emotions seem to be both a play toy and inconvenient, and that's super shitty.

For your mom, it sounds like you need to just accept that she's not interested or cares how you feel, so don't go looking for her that. You only told us about this one situation, and maybe she's not this bad at other times, but at least for this situation, she's not the one to get emotional support from. Lean into your husband and good friends for that, and give your mother some space and/or just don't talk about this specific thing. I would also avoid family events where this uncle will be present, or just show up for a bit and have something else so you can't stay long. I'm not saying do this to punish them or to make a point to them, but for your own emotional well being. Spend time with your sister and new niece at other times when mom and uncle aren't around.

Trying for a baby is emotionally tough, so don't set your own emotional bar at ""being excited about starting my own family"". However long it takes to get pregnant, the time until you do is not going to be an exciting time. And even after you get pregnant, there are no guarantees (even though it gets more likely the longer you're pregnant). Like, I wouldn't even tell your mom until after the first trimester, at earliest."
Have you pointed out his blatant hypocrisy?
I would also love to read your book OP! :)
"Davies is a jerk. He's one of these people that thinks her can be an asshole and then brush it off by saying its a joke.

Honestly, you are so young, and there are a world of better men out there than Davies. He is bottom of the barrel."

"I meet a lot of unfamiliar dogs! They like me because I give them beef jerky. Usually Slim Jim or Jack Links, always a flavor that's not too spicy (""original?"" I've also bought flavors that aren't advertised with flames, such as ""maple bacon"" etc.)

Boyfriend's doggo will probably love you on sight because Boyfriend is introducing you. But sometimes I meet dogs that are very particular, or stressed out. They aren't sure about me and might bark or stay back, on guard. When this happens, I smile and say hello in a pleasant voice, and throw a piece of the beef jerky to them. Most of the time, they make friends with me quickly after that.

Warning: most dogs never forget you're the one who gives beef jerky. They expect it every time. But they sure love seeing you!"
"Don't drive him. If he's that desperate for his juice, he can buy it online, call an uber, or use some errand running app to get it."
It’s not weird for you to have a relationship with the family. I’d be worried about how controlling your current gf is acting.
"I'm on your side a bit, she has had a rough recent time and has alot of history with rm. But rm was there when she was low. 

I'd say let her get close, ask her to at least keep her witts about her. If things go south be there, don't say I told you so, it will just make things worse."
"Please look at ketogains and click on the community info bar.  Then use their calculator to check your calories and macros.  Or the keto subreddit.  

 1200 is super low for a man of your height. Not eating enough and exercising quite a lot can do a number on your system and mental well being. 

If you've done the yo yo diet thing...maybe try a 20% deficit and strength training for a couple of months.

I wish you the very best."
From reading your post I have a question.  Are you still legally married?
"Girl you're fine. It's super embarrassing when it happens to you, but I guarantee you his mom/sister/etc have been where you were and feel empathetic, if anything. Honestly, as long as you didn't bleed on their couch or something, I don't think they will judge you in any way."
Just continue on as if nothing ever happened. Sounds like if anyone noticed they were being classy and not mentioning it.
Yah.. you and your SO definitely shouldn't be countering that bad advice with actual real advice. Play the petty Olympics with your grandchild future in the balance. See how well that goes.
"No one signs anything after a judge rules. You just get a piece of paper telling you the ruling in the mail. We've already signed divorce papers and turned them in months ago. 

Also, does it make it better or worse that we were hitched and got married in a courthouse without having any actual wedding?"
"He might’ve forgotten that you know the account is him, and he just wants to see what you’re up to in life these days."
"It's never catcalling. Not in any of the instances that I was there to see. It's always people who glance her way. Men and women. The most recent time she tried to pick a fight with some high school student that had apparently called her a th0t even though he didn't. We were at the movies together. I was there. He clearly just told his friends that he ""thought"" the movie was going to be good."

"First of all if someone did see
It , they should have said something . I would have. Like “hey, sorry can I talk to you for a minute in private ... I notice your on your period. Can I help.”?
I would offer clothes and another tampon. But maybe no one did see... 
I totally get feeling embarrassed I would also. BUT it’s natural for a women to get her period. And you were trying to stay to be polite so good on you 💜"
"How does this not come up on the first date?

This would be a huge red flag for me if I were dating someone even casually...it just...comes up. Maybe not in excruciating detail, but it comes up.

Now you look like you're hiding something...and you kind of are, since your divorce is not final.  So ""Hey, there is something I neglected to tell you for no other reason than I simply neglected to tell you. I was married for x years and in 6 months, my divorce will be final. Do you have any questions?"""
"Nobody deserves abuse, bud."
"try again later or work through it. if it’s that big of a deal, try again otherwise you’ll resent him for the rest of your life. if you can get over it, focus on the fact that you’re promising to be engaged to and married to someone. that’s the important part, not the engagement or wedding itself."
"Dude sounds like a dick.  It's not about coping with outlooks, he's just a jerk and it makes him feel powerful to have this over on you."
He's unlikely to change any time soon.  Might wanna reconsider moving in or even dating him?
"Yeah, I would be really upset too if I were you.  However, I think you need to figure out what you want to happen next.  Is fighting with him over this going to change anything at all?  I would really try my best to just let it go as it just doesn't seem worth the energy to me."
"Currently married and in the process of divorcing is first date material.

Definitely before anything sexual happens. You've gotta tell her."
"Unfortunately, trying to explain that her writing is only a success due to the countless hours over the last 8 years will be lost on her parents.

OP, what are your sister’s hobbies? While your sister does not want to be a writer, she may be jealous of your accomplishments (and your parents likely want her to feel acknowledged and accomplished in something, hence pushing her so strongly into writing as you’re quite skilled in it). Since you two are close, maybe you can use some of your publishing earnings to help her achieve a goal she is working towards, either investing in some brushes if she’s an artist or a training session if she’s an athlete, for example."
I know.

"You may not make more money now, but your work is much more important than pouring drinks. Also, you will make more money in the future, so he is preemptively tearing you down in hopes that you’ll stick around once your career takes off.

I’m going to cry in my bowl of cereal now.
"When you date someone, are you still ""you"" or do you find yourself being the version of yourself that you feel best fits the other person? 

I ask because, even though the phrasing is likely coincidental, it's a fairly common behavior and can be seen as ""nice"" and ""sweet"", but it can also come off as disingenuous. 

This is something more typically experienced by women, but I've been on the receiving end of this behavior and it's discomforting, wondering ""do you like me or do you just like the idea of a relationship with me?""

I'm not saying that this is you, but it was a thought that crept into my mind."
Dude dump him he’s a dick.
"I’d get some of those really tiny 1 calorie training treats, so you can give him a lot and kinda trick him into thinking you’re giving him way more treats than you really are. Dogs will pay more attention to the frequency you’re treating them than how much is in each bite. 

My dog really likes the liver ones, they’re really flavorful I guess. Just make sure you don’t give him a treat for bad behavior. Save them for when he’s being a good boy and reward him coming to you in a friendly way— if you bribe him to stop barking or growling, he may get confused and think you’re rewarding the bad behavior."
"Any race would help each other out if it were life or death, idk why latinx families had anything to do with it.

The only reason you brought up race is because families helping each other out and being there for each other is a known stigma of latinx families, so it was a blanket statement."
"To quote you:
&gt;I owe no random stranger on the internet an explanation.

You might want to consider why you're spending time arguing with this person for no reason. Is it easier than facing the other comments?"
"You get to make a choice about how much help you'll offer, but your stepdaughter gets to make a choice about whether she wants to be in your life and whether she'll allow you to see her child. You have to accept that."
"First of all, like I said earlier: your loving her speaks positively about you. But, let’s set that aside for now.

Second of all, you are seeing the overt layer of abuse (the comments, the bullying), but completely missing the deeper layer of psychological abuse. This person is fucking with your mind to the point where you think you deserve this. You don’t. No one does, and there’s no room for negotiations on this. She should be building you up, and helping you to argue with the voice that’s telling you you are worthless, not joining in with it.

Third of all, loving someone isn’t a reason to endure abuse. Besides, you gotta love yourself too. 

Some questions to ask yourself:

If you had a child, and your child was in your position, how would you feel about it? Be your own parent!!

Are you hiding how she treats you from anyone, or downplaying it to others? If you’re covering for her, that’s your gut telling you something is wrong. 

Do you think she is showing love in her actions? Hint: nope.

Do you want you children growing up thinking that it’s okay to treat people the way she treats you? (They will! Kids learn way more from what you do compared to what you say!)

Do you want your kids growing up thinking it’s okay for someone else to bully them? 

My family of origin was heavily abusive, and I spent 10 years of my adult life trying to have a relationship with them. I finally cut ties, and everything started getting better. I had been diagnosed with Major Depression for over a decade - something I thought was incurable. But, it’s dissipating. I sleep better, I lost weight, I started smiling more. I deserved better, and so do you.

You are not broken. You are not unlovable. You are not a failure. You are not defective. You are not weak. You are not over-sensitive. You are not worthless. You are not a waste of oxygen. You are not selfish. I have thought all these things myself, and I think you have thought some too. But, they are all lies! As long as you believe the lies, the abuse can continue, because you think it is justified. That’s why the abuser keeps the lies around."
"Dogs fake a lot of things. Dogs can be pretty smart, actually."
"Tldr: leave him.

This kind of surveillance, controlling, and emotional manipulation will only get worse, especially if you resist. What's worse is that he'll use your setting of any (HEALTHY AND NECESSARY) boundaries as further evidence to ramp up his freakouts.

This isn't at all about the tattoo, because it's YOUR body and you do whatever the fuck you want with it. Period, end of story.

Quietly figure out an exit plan and LEAVE. Get a friend or several friends you trust in the loop so they know to watch for any warning signs or escalation."
"Ya did good, OP.

My only advice is to give your husband a big hug and kiss and tell him how important he is to you."
"She has an anger problem. Know someone that is going to therapy because she overreacts to the smallest of things and gets upset over it making things toxic.

You can’t change her. She has to want to change. Just let her know you can’t be around this type of situation and it happens too frequently for you."
Just because there’s no screaming or hitting doesn’t mean it isn’t abusive/harmful
People have a strong tendency to believe that behaving like the aristocracy makes them seem like the aristocracy... when the real aristocrats have already outgrown whatever behavior or tradition that is being brought up.

"Ahh sorry That thought just popped into my mind while I was reading, thank you for that tho"
"I have this issue sometimes. I think it's because growing up I had a very judgmental person constantly telling me I was doing something the wrong way. I still struggle with trusting myself to do anything right around other people, I constantly second-guess and prefer someone tell me how they prefer to do it. Whereas if I'm by myself doing the same tasks, I work and function perfectly.

I don't know if this is his problem. If his mother or father were very overbearing and telling him how to do things ""right"" to the littlest detail, I can see why he might feel like a burden and just want to stay out of the way.

All I can think of is maybe therapy would help him. He needs a safe space where he can learn how to trust his own thoughts."
I hope he's moving into his own place and not in with you. He needs to live on his own for a bit and lean how to adult.
"I dated a guy for five years who would pick fights with me then give me the silent treatment, telling me it was my fault and I deserved it. 

I dumped him and married a man that talks to me like a person. Ymmv."
"I'm sorry. For what it's worth, the love in the beginning was probably genuine, but when people say things like ""when men are too kind and caring to me I start to be mean and nasty,"" they mean it. Alternating between that and lovebombing will rip your heart to shreds, and she cared for you enough to quit while y'all were ahead rather than letting it slowly decay into an absuive relationsip. You can't fix broken people, and she was one. Take the beautiful memories and be glad it happened, but also remember that this is the best way it could have ended. Let yourself mourn for a little longer, then learn to care for and love yourself as much as she cared for you those first few months"
I thought the kid was on fire - that's why I dumped water on them! Honest mistake!
"I saw this post on the other sub and honestly you both suck. Showing up at bedtime ish five nights a week, unless it’s absolutely unavoidable, is shitty parenting. This isn’t about sexism (which is prevalent in a lot of the comments) this is about both of your child’s parents spending as little time as possible with her because they can afford not to. You chose to have this kid, you should act like it."

"I went to art school and I want to give him a swirly, op"
"I mean, I wouldn’t consider myself easy in the way I assume you are thinking"
"I may look into talking to a therapist for at least a couple sessions. I recently ended my treatment with mine because I have been doing so well and then all this happened. I feel like I’m handling it okay but I have missed having someone that I can just vent to without feeling burdensome lol. 

I guess that’s true, part of me just feels like I’ve seen a side of her that she keeps hidden from most others if that makes sense. 

And I’m trying not to stay angry, I don’t really enjoy being angry. I’ll be okay and be keeping it cordial and then something I hear her say will just randomly make me feel so infuriated at the whole situation with her. 

Thank you!"
"&gt;This isn't at all what I said

I guarantee you that if multiple people here are hearing you say it, so is your stepdaughter."
"This is excellent advice. You can't leave her stuck at sea. You may not want to get in the water with her, but at least throw her a life vest in the form of advice on how to make the best of what is going to be a challenging situation. Equip her with some life skills she isn't expected to know so young. Prioritisation, budgeting, time management are all skills that I am sure all of us could agree on, we kinda sucked at when 18."
Lol! Well let’s be real though... you don’t want to be the dude who finishes too quickly... and it’s super hard to judge when the other dude is going to be done (you aren’t really paying attention)
"You're not nearly old enough to be expected to provide for your own needs! She needs to step up to motherhood and get you the things you need, things she should have provided you to begin with. This is all sorts of crazy! I have a soon to be 18 y/o and wouldn't dream of him having to buy his own clothes for school. If hos cousin destroyed his stuff I'd make sure they were replaced. 

I'm sorry you're in this situation, this is nuts."
"That was when he was here. In my city.  
He just used to get distracted from his work so he told me not to."
"Alright, I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion by all the ""you do you girl"" crowd here, but I'll just add my two cents as a male anyway. 

First off, yes, shaving your genitals is a personal matter of taste, but so is going down on you or having sex with you. That being said, I personally wouldn't go down on or have sex with someone who isn't clean shaven. You know. Personal preference works both ways. 

Personal hygiene is a huge factor when it comes to arousal, and yes, from a male's perspective, an unshaven vagina can be a bit off putting if you're not into that. 

The issue here isn't you being ""unclean"", it's more likely your SO's attraction towards you is fading, and there are certain things that he did not think much of before, because if you are attracted to someone, you just let certain smaller things slip. But it builds up over time to a point where it just... bothers you. Having ""meh"" sex is still better, than having no sex I guess.

Is there any real ""good"" way of telling someone that you don't feel so attracted to them anymore? Is there a really ""good"" way of telling your SO, that you don't actually feel so aroused by them anymore?

I guess he could have worded things differently, yes, but that does not change the fact that he's just isn't that much into you anymore, which can happen after 5 years."
"Sometimes male relatives believe they have control over their female relative’s sexual relationships. He’s on some power trip with you. Your girlfriend needs to acknowledge what her brother is doing and make him stop. You and her brother don’t have to be friends, but he does need to be civil with you."
"Not should she. It’s her private personal property. There’s single a common thread among all toxic relationships that are posted about here and it’s when couples allow each other to go through their phones or give login information to each other as a “show of trust”. 

You were cheated on? Not your woman’s fault. You’re paranoid and jealous? Not your woman’s fault. 

And she shouldn’t cater to your damaged outlook on trust."
Just block her. Problem solved.
"I doubt she said anything, and even if she did I mean, drinking makes it hard to get it up and everyone knows this. 

There's a good chance that this is a new enough fling that she just decided the awkwardness was too much to keep going. 

I mean, you're BOTH ghosting each other at this point, as you haven't texted her either...? Trying to play hard to get...? Don't you think she might be playing the same game...? If you want to talk to her, do it. Break the ice. Otherwise, just write this off."
"Is it possible for you to leave. Hand in your notice to the landlord and move into another place, or say you're moving back home to save money or something, then just bounce to another place? Any of that possible?"
Yes I totally understand that and I have been really discreet with my relationship in order to save his feelings. But yes I can totally see how it could hurt him.
"So you knew that he had to press his wife to agree to participate in a threesome and yet you did it? Do you often enjoy having sexual relations with someone that has to be pressured into the situation? 

Your friend is scum. Seriously. What did he expect to happen? Sounds to me like she went after you in bed to push his buttons.

Move forward, make better and kinder life choices and don’t have sexual relations with people who have to be pressured into doing it."
"I would leave him alone if you actually care for him, cheating and leaving him.   
It's been almost half a year, a 6th of your time together you've been split pursuing your affair.  
I he don't deserve to get everything ripped up again."
"each person has their own ”language of love”. hers doesn't include compliments. ask her what she responds to: physical touch? gift?

also she told you what makes her comfortable: toning down on the compliments. i fail to see what more you want us to tell you"

"He should not apologize for her ""feeling"" something that she has no evidence of.

He was not insensitive, neither having deal breakers nor breaking up is insensitive by itself."
"* You can't control other people.
* The fact that you two seemed to have organised a wedding that was NOT what you wanted but what her family wanted shows how much you were willing to sacrifice for her family to be 'comfortable' and is commendable.
* The family decided to last-minute NOT turn up with BS reasons of minor inconveniences. They are absolutely human garbage.
* Your wife was and is devastated, likely because of the total betrayal/abandonment of her family, but likely also because she didn't get the wedding she wanted in the first place.

All you can do is accept these people are scum and let your wife 'mourn'. She may have decided already to cut these people out entirely and is realising the consequences of that. She is probably also questioning herself: ""Why did I bend over backwards for these people?"", ""Is it that much trouble to drive 30 minutes to a wedding?"", ""Have they never cared about me?"". I mean: she's made sacrifices for family who then couldn't be bothered to turn up. That shows a major imbalance in the relationship where to her these people meant much more than she apparently did to them.

You don't choose your family but you can choose whether to see them at all, under what conditions you want them in your life etc. It's totally ok to cut people out that add nothing to your life, especially if they are detrimental, even if they are family. I think you need to give your wife time.

Also, this was probably the most ridiculous thing about this wedding: ""They wanted to celebrate the weekend we got back from our honeymoon with a dinner."" Eeeh, so THEY wanted to decide how THEY celebrated YOUR marriage? Never in my life have I heard such BS. Sure, if a friend can't make it because their child was born around that time, they had other very pressing things to attend, it would be great if they suggest some kind of alternative way to celebrate with just you two. HOWEVER, that was totally NOT the case here as this whole wedding seemed to have been organised specifically for the family members who chose to then not turn up. 

I feel really sorry for your wife and also for you. Also, you yourself can decide that you no longer want her family in your life of what they did to her but also to you. This was as much your wedding as it was hers, and their behaviour has greatly impacted you as well. It's not just up to her whether she wants these people in her life or not, but you yourself can decide to cut them out, or only see them at funerals or something etc."
"You definitely handled that specific situation well, but ever really ending that relationship wrote getting into a new relationship and that cool."
"Yeah, it makes me wonder if they all decided to be a major inconvenience during the planning, knowing they would all bail last minute. I don't know why people would be so evil, but obviously we only hear one side of the story."
"Hello beautiful!
First of all, life is too short to worry about what others say. Secondly, if that guy is meant to be yours, trust me no power in this universe can steal him from you. On the other hand if he isn't meant to be yours, trust me girl no force in this world will ever let him be yours no matter how hard you try, and how painfully you cry. Just cherish the moment and fuck what others say. People are temporary they'll just come, make comments and go away: Even your parents. At the end it will only be you all by yourself. Just do what makes you happy and live in the moment. People are simply jealous because they couldn't get a handsome man and that they aren't as lucky as you are! People always talk shit when they can't get what you have. So just enjoy them being envious 😉 and don't let them succeed in their incentives. They just want to make you insecure so that you might ruin your relationship. Don't let them win! Just focus on your boyfriend and how he treats you. If he is treating you like the prettiest woman on this Earth, he is the one you should be worrying about the most. Be happy and cherish him forever! I wish you a very happy life darling 😘"
Tell him you’re ready to get married and settle down. If his reaction is not enthusiastic agreement then this relationship has probably run its course. Don’t waste the end of your twenties on someone who doesn’t want the same things from life as you do.
"This is an overreaction.

You did what was reasonable to let him know your tattoo would take longer, working over time until the job was complete is pretty standard, but maybe you should have made him aware of that (even then, he could have worked it out)

He should have dropped it as soon as you said you were okay, if he was truly concerned, why didn’t he go to the appointment with you or at the very least drive by the shop at closing to see if you were still there if he was that concerned?

Overthinking and Overanalysing never really produces good results."
"Thank you for the advice, I think it's tricky because he seems so happy in the relationship that even when I try to bring things up he doesnt realise how big of a deal this is to me. I think if we broke up now it would be a total shock to him. I'll try and get out more by myself (and tbh I'm happy going out alone sometimes too!) but I dont want to hurt him. You're right though, something needs to change or I guess things will have to end."
"She probably doesn't notice when she's doing it, because it's what she grew up with. It will take a long time for her to break the habit, bit it sounds like you guys have good communication, so I think you can do it.

What you have to do is first have a talk with her and explain how it makes you feel when she gives you orders for everything. Tell her you are willing to do it her way if it's important to her, but most everyday things you are going to do your way and she has to accept that, because adults all have their own way of doing things. That she might feel more relaxed if she lets go a little.

Then you have to train YOURSELF to notice how you feel. Right now, it seems like you feel guilty when she starts up. You automatically think you did something wrong. Instead try to just recognize, ""oh, she is taking control again. Time to gently remind her.""

Then the next time she gives you orders, just stop everything for a minute, smile and say ""I have this. Don't worry."" If she persists, say ""you're doing it again,"" and just pause your work and look at her until she gets it.

It's like Pavlov's dogs. It's a habit for her. After a while if you persist, you can help her develop a new habit."
If i were you i would show them this post once i move out.
"This is above reddit's pay grade.

Keep speaking with the therapist"
"I'm not sure you should break it to them at all, If you act like you feel guilty or like this is some dark secret you have to come clean about, it just gives validity to their unreasonable expectations. They dragged you to church all those years, and now it's your turn to drag them into the real world, where there's room for a diversity of faiths and beliefs and for the most part everything works out just fine. If your relatives can't handle that, it's not your fault."
"Nope. Again, this assumes you’ve done what I referenced earlier. If you’ve sat with him and explained all of what you feel and had a real discussion where he gets to do the same at the end there should be some sort of resolution. As a result of discussion he should know how important this is to you and if doesn’t get down on one knee right there it should be timing you feel reasonable. If you’re stuck on the what’s the rush argument, you’ve already told him at length how you feel so that’s him blowing you off. If you can’t come together as partners to address this issue what happens in the future with truly challenging issues."
"You cannot make this better. Not with the stance you have right now and you don't appear to want to engage in the other scenarios that people are suggesting, so really not sure what else there is to say than, all the best to the poor 18 year old, she is going to need it!"
"From what you are describing, his behaviour looks like the method of a narcissist. They will start with casually pointing out things that are different between you and then, and saying that they are totally fine with it. Then there will be jokes and small remarks. You are unconfortable, but if you say anything you will look like you cant handle a joke or a ""slight remark"" . After a while it seems like the joke is always on you and more criticism. He will try to destroy your self-esteem and based on what you said, or seems that it was starting to work : you were thinking about his remarks and reconsidering your view of yourself based on how HE was describing you. HUGE narcissist vibe here. By any chance, do you have some friends that are more supportive of who you are and that he doesn't like? Did he try to make them look bad to you in any way? That's usually the next step for a narcissist, he will manage to cut out of your life those who will help your confront him. Is he a very charismatic and seductive person? 

Never ever let anybody tell you who you are or who you should be. If he wants to be with another artist, he should leave and find one. If he's gonna be with you, he should man up and stop asking you to change."
"Caring about her and caring about your best friend, and wanting the best for both of them, you should let it happen and suck it up. 

Then take your girl out for a day, something that'll really make her smile, maybe buy her some lingerie (if she'd like that) and put all your energy into your girlfriend.. the one you have, now, and are committed to.

It's life, bud. What happens happens. Especially since it'll be his first relationship (ever/in a while.) You probably won't be talking to him as much later on if it does go through and you'll have to accept that. Might as well treat her to replace that lost time and reinforce/reignite your relationship, she will most likely return that energy and feel more secure.. therefore you will too!"
Right? Every four year old I know goes to bed between 630 and 730 so do they even have time for dinner?
"Yeah I am somewhat similar, if people are always giving compliments then they start coming off insincere to me. So try and save it for when you really mean it and find other ways to show her affection, maybe ask her more about how her family show love."
"&gt;I didn’t get the sense you don’t care

That makes one of us"
"Self esteem issues that you need to face. Also, stop listening to what others say - their opinions are none of your business. If things are great between you and your boyfriend, then that's all that matters."
"I don't want to force him but I just really hope he tries to get a job soon. We're both in university now so he has class to fill his days now but I worry that this is what it'll be like after university and he still will find excuses not to get a job. I don't want to be a jerk and dump him for his personality (sounds super harsh when I type it like that ahah) and it's not like he's a mean and horrible person, I just...want a more exciting life?? Maybe if I communicate this to him he could change? idk"
"I would tell her she can no longer use your phone. If she wants privacy and wants to ensure no one other than her will read conversations she's had in private with friends, that is totally fair, and I think you should so the same. If she then gets angry or what, you should ask her why she should have access to your phone but doesn't want you touching hers.

If you think she's hiding something, maybe talk to someone who knows her? It's best to ask her yourself though then to try to dig in her past via other people, as I imagine the latter won't go over well."
"Firstly, congratulations to you and your partner! I hope you both have a wonderful day together. As someone who is getting married next month, I understand what you are feeling &amp; know that you cannot please everyone. We are also planning a ceremony without any religious aspects &amp; we have religious family members/friends included on the day.

You are doing the right thing, in terms of having the day how you both want it. Ultimately if anyone has an issue with it, they are welcome to plan their own wedding the way they want it. You &amp; your partner need to be united on this and it's great that you've already agreed what you both want. 

Fortunately I have very supportive family members, but if you are worried I would prepare some closed answers to any questions they have.

'My partner and I have already decided to do X and are happy about it.'

'We are doing X because we have both agreed to it as it's our day.'

'We have already spent money on \[Non church\] venue because we both agreed it was perfect for me &amp; my partner.'

Do not let them guilt, persuade or manipulate you into changing your day into their day. Do not apologise for doing things the way you want. If they are persistent I would info-diet them, uninviting people is not off the table (if you go back in my post history you can read about why I've uninvited someone from my upcoming wedding.)

As I say, this is your day &amp; you get to organise it down to the minute, what people will drink &amp; what photo's will be taken. I promise you will enjoy the day 1000000% more if you've planned it how you both want it, with a disgruntled family member, instead of your family doing it how they want.

Best of luck to you &amp; your fiance, and enjoy your big day."
"Looks like Davis has a superiority complex and thinks poorly of your choices or rather you. It's the same kind of a thing as Vegans thinking that everyone that don't agree with them are below them.
Even if he says that it's a joke, it isn't. That's just a poor excuse.
I always believed that two people can be in a relationship even though they have different tastes in most things, as long as they respect and appreciate it, or take active interest in it inspite of not having as hard of a drive towards it as the other. Which you seem to be doing. My ex and I had very distinct hobbies and we both appreciated each other's interest and dedication, encouraged it, and tried to participate in it because why not.
What people generally fail to understand that your relationship's conditions not only takes a toll on your mental health but causes behavioral changes when that person is around.
If you and Davis have ever hungout with your friends, as them if they see a change in you when he is around as compared to when he isn't. That's where you'll find a concrete answer that you might find hard to come up with on your own.
And if that is the case, it's time to cut ties, seems hard but, you should be your priority over anyone else, no one is going to be able to understand you better than yourself."
Then it's not a fake sneeze it's something separate and used for communication
"Ever heard the story of the boy who cried wolf? This seems to me like a scenario like that. You've threatened him with a break-up so many times, but it's all just been threats. Words are just words, you need to take some actual action. Don't *say* you're going to call the police. Call the police."
"FWIW, I had a bestie who married a guy that hated me. She and I met in sixth grade and within a month, we became inseparable and I spent so much time at her house growing up that I was considered family. 

Then when M was 19, she started dating J, and just a few months later, she told me they were getting engaged. I was maid of honor at their wedding, and then her husband forebade her to talk to me. Yeah, he hated me, for no good reason. Turned out J was abusive to M, and he didn't want anyone around her who could get her away from him.

I don't think you should talk to your friend's guy, OP. I do think you might want to leave an opening for your best friend to come back, because she may need an escape route. That's what happened with my friend M. She left J about a month after he shoved her arm through a plate glass window."
"You don’t.

If your boyfriend gave a flying fuck about women he would have listened to you already. He’s more invested in his “women are gross” narrative. It lets him pass off his personal sexual preferences (which he definitely picked up from porn) as “hygiene.” Why admit that hair is fine and normal when he gets more out of shaming you into shaving? 

At this point it’s deliberate."
I would imagine the mom's credit isn't good enough to get a business loan.  It sound like the parents have a drug or alcohol problem.
"I was in a very similar situation when I got married a few years ago. My family is very Catholic, especially my grandparents. Their life revolves around church. My husband and I are not religious at all so we didnt want a religious ceremony which I thought was going to be an issue. It wasn't. We didn't make a point of telling people it wasn't going to be a religious ceremony  we just did it how we wanted. I would just continue moving through your planning process and don't feel the need to explain anything unless someone asks. And if someone asks, confidently tell them what you plan to do and dont leave the door open to input. In my case, no one asked or seemed to care. My bet is your family probably already knows you aren't very religious and this wont come as a shock. Btw, congratulations 😊"

"I remember one of my first arguments ever with my ex being when we had started living together, in a shared house with other people. We'd just moved out of our respective parents' homes and this eejit wanted to 'educate' me on the 'correct' i.e. his, way of doing the dishes.

I'd just come from a rather poorer home than he had - his family had a very modern kitchen with dishwasher, as I'd come from a broke one where they were done by hand. I'd also been working in commercial kitchens washing dishes for most of the time we'd been together. He didn't try to educate the other housemates, just me because I was his partner.

It's important to quickly put it out there - if you want it done just so, you can do it yourself.  There is no better way to appear more ungrateful than by criticism and it soon trains a person not to do anything at all because they'd rather not be told off. 

And if you really *really* have to have things a certain way I highly recommend living by oneself."
"You may be able to break the lease with no consequences to you if you are in an abusive relationship(which this is). I'm not sure if it varies by state but please look into this. I have been in the same situation where I've felt I couldnt leave break it off with someone simply because they didn't want to or believe me. Best way to show him you really want it to be over is to just do it. Stay with someone you can trust and leave him. Unfortunately, sometimes people like him wont get it through their head until you actually leave. I suggest making reports to the police as well, just so that something is on record. This will come in hand and work in your favor if things get escalate and/or you need to press charges. Most importantly, plan carefully and stay safe!"
Are you being purposefully obtuse or do you really not get it?
"Does the whole family have mental issues? That just seems strange to decide on the day that going to their only daughter's wedding is too much of an effort. 

I would leave the family bashing aside right now, sounds like your wife needs emergency mental care, treatment and a lot of therapy (not once a week). Your wife seems to be reacting rather extremely. It needs to be dealt with in a serious manner"
[removed]
"I mean, it's a pointless statement.  You will be helping her raise the baby, you know that. You're not going to look at the newborn child of the step daughter you clearly love, who is living with you, and not help. Besides, your sd is still a kid herself, and if you want her to have any hope for a future, you guys are going to need to offer considerable support. 

So stop with the hardline. She made bad decisions, but there's a baby coming who's totally innocent."
"She is not your friend. You need to repeat that until it gets through to you. In the mean time, block her number. This creepy, possessive behavior is not acceptable."
That's what I would love!! I try to even do little things like 'lets walk around town and maybe grab a small lunch in a coffee shop' but even that can be too much sometimes. I think at some point I'll have to just make it clear to him how much of a problem this is becoming and maybe he'll start making more of an effort?
"Its her phone.

Its none of your business.

If you don't want her on your phone, stop letting her use it.

I never let people on my phone because its MY PHONE and I have a right to privacy...AS DO the people I'm talking to. They didn't sign up to have some over protective boyfriend reading things they shared to me in confidence."
"Its not necessarily toxic to HAVE that information, because in long term, actually trusting relationships it gets passed back and forth, but to feel OBLIGATED to share or that you have a right to that info in the name if trust is toxic."
"Ya, fuck watching your grandchild while your child goes to school to advance and better both of their lives!"
"Forget the question about moving, answer the more immediate matters of compatibility with this man before you consider marrying."
"&gt;he can't control himself when he gets impulses to do stupid shit

Really? Because that was pretty methodical for someone who ""can't control themselves"". This is also the same cousin who puts you in sexual situations you don't want to be in and has acted predatory towards you (post history). The fact he tried to get you alone in his room when he's shown these weird sexual behaviors towards you is the cherry on the ""fuck no"" cake.

As you were advised before, you need to get CPS or APS involved. You need to file a police report against him for the destruction of your property and most of all, you need to leave this house. Your mother has zero interest in protecting you and is taking the easy way out. She'll excuse and cave in to his behavior no matter how bad it gets. So start talking with your other relatives about living with them. Your aunt and uncle know how bad it gets, see if you can't temporarily live with them."
"He's a prick. Not only is he a prick, he's a spiteful one. He's happy to tell you how you're amazing and how you complement each other's personalities in private but then puts you down in the company of other people. Unless you've had a solid shouting match in which you've directly told him that he's out of line I think it is very real to consider breaking up with him. It's is a form of a abuse what he's doing. You're 22 and you're studying for a PHD; nothing at all to be ashamed of. 

He's probably embarrassed because he's a bartender whilst you excel in Academia, your intelligence alone intimidates him no matter how creative he may be."
Now I need to see his art
"In my experience it's more of would you be comfortable if it was the opposite, her seeing her male friend of 10 years? My current boyfriend slept with his best friend of 20 years before we were official. We have drawn boundaries because of the distrust I now feel when he hangs out with female friends. He is not happy about it but he understands we need to rebuilt our trust. Some friends are flirty, some friends are not strictly platonic, my boyfriend said they always had a thing but never acted on it because they were always with other people."
[removed]
"Not much point in commenting at this point, but...

Is his name actually Davis? Twee.

Why do you run yourself so down? 

&gt;This is what happens when I let her dress herself.

When he LETS?? LET'S!!...oh, FFS. Let me at him."
"That makes a lot of sense. Even though her texts were telling me she liked me, I sensed a lot of hostility and judgement, which aren't qualities anyone would want in a romantic partner regardless. It just baffles me how she can like me when she's always acted very superior to me and doesn't like a lot of the things I stand for"
Sounds like he got upset that you rejected him and he started talking shit. I personally would ask him what he's said for your friends the respond this way because it's not normal.
"Thank you so much, this is very inspiring!"
"Sadly, he obviously isn't. I've had to contact parents of people who didn't didn't get the upbringing they needed, and it often helps."
"&gt; I spoke to Davis about it and he said that he's just kidding, it's all in good fun,

The only decision he can make is everything leading up to saying something.  How something is interpreted is not up to him.  That's why you generally don't joke about some things in polite company, like cancer, or alcoholism, because someone could get really offended or upset.  He's not being ""creative"" with his jokes, he's being hurtful.  

&gt; I'm just not sure if I'm being too sensitive, but it feels like he's trying to make me ashamed of my career path and lifestyle, which I am not and will never be.

I'll be blunt - I broke up with a girlfriend over (partially) stuff like this.  I work in a rigid field, I have a generally professional demeanor at all times in both casual and polite company.  I have a very logical/structured way of thinking, even though I'm more of a laid-back personality.  My girlfriend would constantly say things that made me feel like crap.  It's not worth it.  You should find someone who loves you for your qualities, and doesn't try to bring you down for them."
Shut up with your ridiculous diagnosis.

"Good gravy, you might be the nicest person on the planet. Wow. Much love to you."
Why do you keep posting this? NO ONE CARES DUDE.
What horrible people.  Are they punishing her for the loss of their live in unpaid maid?
"The best thing you can do for your brother is succeed and bring him into your life. For now, you will have to leave him behind, but always talk to him, explain to him how much to you love and care about him and that as soon as you are done school and have a stable job  he can come live with you. Encourage and give him hope, it's often enough to get people to endure the harshest of conditions."
Really sorry you’re going through this. I can’t even imagine how your wife is feeling. But you sound like you’re giving her as much support as possible. I hope you both heal and move on.

"You don't have stats so I'm not worried about providing any...?

It IS a thing in MY social circles. Also, there are plenty of times when I see same sex couples and think the same. 

The fact of the matter is, EVERYONE is allowed to set boundaries. If this is something she feels strongly about, she's allowed to. If HE feels strongly about it in the other direction, they should end the relationship."
"I have a friend who is a counsellor. He recently confided in me that 95% of his patience are in his office because of some version of trying to please their parents. I probed further, and he assured me, that was the case. Adults do all kinds of crazy shit and let their parents dictate their lives all over the place... for what? For that same reason you played football all those years. 

So, what I'm telling you is that while this event fucking hurts beyond what you are expressing to us, you can learn and learn good from it. Right here and right now is when you learn to the core that you have to live life to make yourself happy. You can never make them happy and once you are an independent adult you should never try to make them happy. You are lucky to have this event happen right now. It's better for lightening to strike you at 17 then 37. How many more years would you have wasted trying to make them happy?

Keep this memory and replay it every time they want something you don't. No matter what you do, you can't satisfy and black hole's hunger. Lean into figuring out yourself, what you like, and loving yourself for you. You really don't need them. Once the tie is cut, you will feel so free. 

&gt; I have no idea what to do anymore I have one more year of school before I can finally move out and after this.......I plan on moving out as SOON as I graduate.

Very good. Get a job and save ALL the money in a place they can't access. If you can, don't buy anything extra. You will need every penny when you get out. Use the year to make your plans. Plan roommates, locate a place, etc... The time will fly. 

If they say anything to you, just say, ""That day you called me a fucking loser is the day I stopped caring about what you want. That is how it will be for life."" If you want to go further, nails out, you can add, ""lets not waste energy and keep our relationship professional as it will be nonexistent soon."" 

I'm very sorry they hurt you. But, I truly believe if you learn from this, and decide not to try to make them happy, your entire life will be better from it."
"Hi! Morning radio DJ and Dance/Drama Teacher here. 

DUMP THIS PRICK. 

I live a VERY creative life that includes art of many disciplines. Most of the time, I'm encouraging people who are less creative or artistically inclined to give themselves permission to try. I grew up hearing ""wow I could never do that, I'm not artistic like that"" and while growing up and especially now that I teach kids, my response has always been ""I'm able to do this because I decided to try it. I am sure you are just as capable at something like this with the right practice!"" 

I think your boyfriend is potentially insecure about some things:

**A) His own creativity:** simply because people who are confident in their skills have no reason to point out the lack of the same skill in others. If I were confronted by someone claiming to be an artist and I heard or saw them speak in this way about people who haven't dedicated their lives and livlihoods to acutely artistic pursuits, they would immediately be on my ""hah - never working with you"" shit list. He's very likely not as ""wildly creative"" as he wants people (including you) to think he is. 

**B) His actual utility to society:** Let's be real, making it on art is hard - that's why he's a bartender.  I'm not doing it the way I would want to ideally. The majority of my post-college jobs have been places in which I make the case that my creative skills and performance production background make me excellent under pressure and highly adaptive in problem solving situations. Which is true and gets me jobs that pay my bills -BUT! it is also a constant thought of ""maybe I should quit everything and try to actually go for it"" or ""maybe I should have dedicated some of my degree to such-and-such?""  - in other words, unless you are hired constantly as an artist who is making good money, it's a path that can induce a lot of self-questioning. But there's really no reason for someone to take that out on you - that's inappropriate, especially since...

**C) You are too much of a BAMF for him:** You are 3 years his junior and very clearly much more mature than he is. You also have carved yourself a very stable and productive niche in this society, and most of all, it sounds like you are very content with what you are doing! Very threatening to a weak person.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm heated about this too because I really really disagree with how your boyfriend characterizes artistic work. There are a lot of potential rules in art - it's actually really important to my composition process to ""find the rules"" of a given piece (and by my training, that's not super unusual) because when you are composing, you are world building and every world has rules. Even if the rules are ""there are no rules""! Maybe I'm just the academic wank of artistic practice, but I wouldn't take your boyfriend seriously if I heard him say these things. I wouldn't be convinced he was taking it seriously enough."
"Then you should have put in the OP that you just kissed, not have sex. When someone says cheating, the first thing I think if is sex...

Yes, I know accidents happen. That doesn't mean you should continue a pregnancy at such a young age let alone when you're in a bad relationship."
Do the dream wedding with just you two.
"I’m not sure why you’re so eager to rekindle this friendship when she seems to put in so much effort to keep it ended. Also given the context in which she ended it (an extremely unfair expectation placed on a friend and lashing out at all those who disagreed), it’s clear that she views your friendship differently than you do. 

Yes, her fiancé is bizarre and wrong. But I wonder what your friend told him so that he had so much leverage to hate you. I don’t know what kind of arguments you 2 have had, but she’s clearly not forgotten them and has more than likely shared them with her controlling fiancé. 

People change. Time to shed those high schools perceptions, cus she’s not the person you remember. This reminds of those brides who invite their childhood bestie to be their maid of honour. Except they haven’t spent any real time with them as an adult. They then ignore all signs saying that this person is an ass, push through and then wonder why their bachelorette was awful or the wedding speech was torched."
"Yeah, don't do that. If he's half as smart and a capable communicator as the average person, he can turn these techniques around in a way that will perpetually and permanently make you look like the bad guy.

Let it go, and stop trying to bond with him. He doesn't like you, he's entitled to his opinion, and unless he says or does something REALLY out there, bringing this up (again?) with your girlfriend will only fuel the fire."
Did you point out to your mother that her borrowing money from you actually means you can’t go to college this semester? Does she care about how her behaviour is affecting you and your prospects for the future?
"Good lord have mercy, I hope this is a straight troll. 

If not, I don't even know wher to begin. You need to stop thirsting after women and get your life, attitude, goals, and just shit in general together before you even think about a healthy dating life."
Religion is an important thing for her. She grew up with it of course. She's not as strict on it as her parents though. I was a bit disheartened when I heard that they didn't really like my religious views but the advice of breaking bread and maybe joining a service is good. I'll do my best. Thanks

"Fkn assholes and shame on them. They better grovel to her feet, even then there is no excuse. I went to my brothers wedding on hour and half sleep."
Because it’s a bad idea. It will just be emotional and awkward and won’t help anything.
"Everyone has different boundaries I guess. My boyfriend has a very close female friend, so close he walked her down the isle at her wedding. I have only met her a few times, but I would have no problem if they went out for a drink or dinner without me."
"Not your friend. 

This woman has negative amounts of respect for you. She certainly feels *entitled* to you, but she doesn’t much care how you feel about it. There is no way to turn someone like this down without risking a shitshow. Your best bet is a single text (get it down in writing in case she escalates) telling her that you’re not romantically interested in her and to please stop bringing it up. 

She will be pissed. No matter how gently you phrase it. Do it anyway. If she refuses to back off, you may need to take more drastic measures. Let’s hope she tantrums in private."
"You’re smarter, better and more successful than your BF and he’s jealous."
"So she probably doesnt need inpatient therapy (as long as shes eating, if shes not eating though inpatient may be a thing to consider, kinda means it's as bad as it can get), but she does need some intensive outpatient therapy. Like multiple days a week, considering her aversion to strangers I'd stay away from group sessions (as nice and frequent as group sessions are) til shes on the up an up, I'm similar and got nothing from it cause it's literally opening up to only strangers. Get her in consitent therapy asap. 

When all is well in the world go on the honey moon again you both will need it, I'm sorry they ruined your day."

"You are a couple for 8 months now and she checked your Facebook 3 times already. That should tell you how much she trusts you while you've probably not even done anything to justify that amout of mistrust.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no ""normal"" here, everyone has their own boundaries, you just need to talk about them. It's completly fine to have friends of the opposite sex and spend time with them alone, my girlfriend of 6 years has mostly guy friends and it's absolutely no problem because we agreed that she can go out with her friends as much as she likes, I'm just her first priority and as soon as one of those friends tries to hit on her, he's gone.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, talk to her, try to come up with boundaries you both can agree on, but make sure that she understands that your relationship is probably doomed to fail if she can't trust you (for whatever reason that is)."
"Upvotes, man. Upvotes. It pays in self-esteem."
"I’m so sorry OP. You sound smart, just young and trapped. This guy is a total waste of life. What an asshole. Emotional cheating is cheating. You get to set the boundaries in your relationships and even if you haven’t discussed it that is a major no no for most couples. And It doesn’t matter how much time has passed since any of these incidents- they might be old news he’s trying to cover up but to you they’re fresh wound. If he can’t understand that he’s an idiot.

The things he is saying to you are unacceptable and will only get worse. This is manipulate behavior, gaslighting and just plain rude and cruel.


I’d even go so far as to say the bigger issue is how he is responding. I could maybe (probably not) look past the cheating, but threatening to “embarrass” you to your friends and family? Unless they are all horrible people I would think that would be more embarrassing for him, showing that that is how he treats his loved ones. Calling himself elite? What a joke. This is so sad and makes me so angry. You just don’t deserve that. No one does. 

Op it doesn’t matter how hot you or some else thinks he is. Or how low you think of yourself. There are plenty (more than one!!) of guys who will treat you like a normal human being with common decency, and MORE than that. Because that’s what you deserve. You just need to wait, and look. You’re young! I’m not much older lol. 

I know this is all over the place but I really hope you leave this guy. He is not worth staying. You can’t fix him and he’s not worth fixing. Him and his scumbag buddies can keep cheating on their SOs, they can swap and trade for all I care. Just get away from that toxic guy and his shitty friends."
I like this. Play your mom's retarded game.
He might have never wanted the dog. You say he and his ex got the god temporarily but ended up keeping it. Since your bf doesn’t like dogs it was likely the ex. Then the ex moved away leaving your bf with the dog he doesn’t like.
"&gt;I told what was at the time a small lie and told Jon that me and Ray didn’t try to get back together after that fight, and that I was single.

You cheated on Jon and you cheated on Ray, you should sort your shit out and distance yourself from your abuse husband and leave the dude who you manipulated alone."
"If she’s still in this much distress weeks after your wedding, she needs major help. Like inpatient treatment with a group of psychiatrists. Like gone for a few months of treatment type help. Something is really wrong. Once a week counseling isn’t going to crack this one. The fact that she’s probably suicidal and her therapist didn’t commit to an involuntary hold is very distressing. Use the money that you were going to use on the wedding to find her some serious help. Now."
"Stay away for a few days, and then tell them that you didn't appreciate being dragged into their marital drama - that if they both weren't really ok with having a threesome they shouldn't have involved you.  Further, considering they both obviously had some misgivings about the situation, you feel it was sort of shitty of them to involve you.  Basically, knowing that it had a chance of getting awkward, they did the math and decided that jeopardizing their friendship with you was worth them trying to get their rocks off - and that's not what good friends do.

In the future:

1. Be very wary of threesomes with married couples.  They usually have a ton of mental issues going on and aren't anywhere near emotionally ready to open their marriage (that's why they're baby-toeing it with a threesome instead of just going out and banging separate people).

2. Be very wary of a couple trying their first threesome.  As mentioned above, they're probably chock full of issues about actually having sex with someone else and seeing their spouse do the same, so it's gonna be a mess.

3. Don't ever have a threesome with a couple unless you're ok with never seeing them again.  There's a good chance that they'll end up with some sort of jealousy issue and you'll get the boot, or they'll want you as a long-term third, but in a subordinate position where you have to be 100% devoted to them and making sure their precious marriage is preserved, but they only care about you when it's convenient to them - and then they get pissy when you decide that doesn't work for you and leave."

"Why the hell did u had a kid when u barely spend time with her?

"At first I had your &amp; his ages mixed up, and was thinking as I read 'well, 26 is kinda old for a man not to know how money works, but we've all been a little irresponsible now and then, he may yet grow up a little'. But then re-read - and you're 26 while he's 32. I don't think that's a massive age gap, but for sure 32 is WAY too old for a man to be living with his parents, saving nothing, spending his cash as soon as it comes in and still imagines he'll be a homeowner by 40. As brutal as it is, and no matter how great you think he is, my advice: RUN. Someone this irresponsible about money is not likely to be responsible or a good long-term prospect for you; it's not about being materialistic or sexist, but rather about seing: this guy just does not know how to adult. And that bodes ill for YOUR emotional as well as financial health in the next decade, which is a crucial time for you to be making big choices. Dump, explain why, and run."
"I feel kind of sorry for your parents.  I'm sure they love you...in their own twisted way.  But missing out on knowing their own child is tragic.  I love my kids, but more than that, I like them.  They're both adults now and we love spending time together.  It's always special and we laugh a lot!  Watching them become themselves was fascinating.  We never chose their path for them.  At least not consciously.  I suppose what we exposed them to influenced them.  

My son just graduated with a degree in engineering,  but when he was little he wanted to be a chef and a stand up comedian.  So we bought him some cookbooks and kitchdn gadgets.  And we watched stand up comedians with him.  Like I said,  it's been fascinating. (He also loved Star Wars and airplanes,  so maybe that's why he's an engineer. )

How sad it is that your parents didn't just let you be you.  Now you've got a big adventure ahead of you and they don't get to be a part of it.  

Like Bette Midler said, ""Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.""

Living well is the best revenge.  I hope you have a  fabulous life filled with interesting people who love you for who you are.  You've already proven that you can work hard.  I'm sure you'll be a big success at whatever captures your imagination."
"sounds exactly my dad. i’m 18, and my dad used to and still says stuff like that to me. happened just the other week actually. it hurts, it really does. but i’ve learned that his opinion doesn’t matter, only mine does. i love him, but i resent the things he says about me and thinks about me. 
he may be my dad, but i don’t have to care or agree with the things he says. so i just ignore them and keep doing my thing. that’s the best you can do.
i’ll tell you this though, it doesn’t feel like it’ll get better, but it will. my dad has kind of loosened up around me the past few years. not much, but a little. even if your dad doesn’t change his ways, just know that you’re important and you are in no way a loser. 💕"
"""Look mom, when I eat, hours later I make a caca!""

That's what art is to me, and I'm currently an artist. Yes, you can eat very well and have a well-tended sphincter, but it's still shit. Dignity lies not in the arts.

In the same vein, making fun of someone for not being creative either a) totally misses that they're creative in more subtle ways or b) is making fun of someone's bowel obstruction. That's just rude and a great way to make people wish you hemorrhoids.

Your boyfriend is being an asshole. He probably has some wankers' praise so far up his ass that shit is streaming from his mouth. Sorry to be graphic but it's the most accurate metaphor I could come up with.

Hopefully (hope is another kind of shit) you can distance yourself enough to smell more clearly.

Use your nose! When it smells like shit..."
"This. So much this.

I mean, of course, there is a monumentally greater context to all this. Things like this don't just happen, they're part of some bigger pattern. It is not described in the OP's text, but there is undoubtedly some kind of dysfunctional relationship in the family of OP's wife. It is as clear as day. I have no doubt that this is just the final event in a huge list of events.

Maybe it was even something possible to predict, based on the previous behavior of her parents, but it is the kind of thing that we often refuse to see, or do not want to believe that it is possible. ""This time, of course, they won't do that."" ""For this event at least, certainly, they will act differently."" But it just didn't happen. It was as bad as it looked, and it all fell apart. 

The problem here is that the OP wife is currently dealing with two huge disappointments at the same time. The first one is the event itself, which is horrible enough for almost anyone to beare. But the second is even worse - it's the fact that the situation is probably forcing her to confront (and accept) something she probably tried not to see for years: how much her family doesn't care.

It's very likely that all the other events in her life she's tried to ignore. She tried to swallow the excuses, she tried to lie to herself saying that everything was fine. And she pushed everything forward. But this time it's too important, too serious, too offensive and too cruel. To such an extent that she is being forced to accept what she never wanted to see. It can't mean anything other than what's obviously apparent.

I'm so sorry OP. Yeah, this is way too much, because that's a snowball that's been growing for years. Try to get as much support from the therapist as you can and follow his suggestions."
"We really weren't expecting them to cancel. Her brother was a possibility, but my wife has lived with her parents her entire life until we got married. They even wanted to live with her after marriage on the property or in the house.

I'm not agreeing to that now for obvious reasons."
"I think honestly in these cases is the moral thing to do even if there are bad consequences. Would you want to know if he's cheated on you? Cheating is not only bad because you are breaking emotional trust, but also because by having sex with someone else you are potentially indirectly exposing your partner to STIs via the one you cheated with.

I just wonder why you got pregnant by someone when the relationship wasn't even good to begin with... Also, you're only 22. Why did you decide to get pregnant so young?"
Do you think this could have impacted why they didn’t show?
"If he's been emotionally and physically abusive and still continues to do so (doesn't matter to what degree,  abuse is abuse even if there's just a little bit of it)  then you need to leave,  at least for the sake of your baby. Your baby didn't deserve to grow up with an abusive parent,  it's gonna fuck the child up,  mentally,  the only way to avoid that is to not let the child grow up in that enviroment. One absent parent is 100 times better then both of them present and one enabling the abuse of the other,  it doesn't matter who's the abuse directed at. Your baby comes first,  be responsible."
"Zero of what you have said changes the fact, she was had to be pressured into it. We are not accusing you of forcing her to have sex. 

We are just clearly stating regardless of when it happened that she had to be pressured into the act. She knew her husband wouldn’t react well. Again, I stand firm you cared more about getting laid then the best interest of your friend’s marriage. 

Regardless it’s clear you care more about lessening guilt and protecting your ego than you care about making changes in your life."
"I’m not going to comment on her parents skipping the wedding as that is just pure cray cray.
But as to your wife crying for 2 weeks, and people calling that she should be an impatient etc. 
I had a really traumatic personal event happen to me a few years ago. I cried non-stop, like your wife, for 3 whole weeks. I could do nothing without crying. It was horrible. But after 3 weeks, I started to have periods of not crying, and now I only cry once every 6 months! 
My suggestion is to support her, give her time, it might just take her a little longer."
"Thank you so much, I'm still figuring out my feelings"
"I don’t think it’s wrong. 

But are you comfortable showing the family your current girlfriend? Are they comfortable seeing your girlfriend?
If no for either answer, I think she might have a point."
Oh no! Expecting people to raise their own children! The horror!
"You are right, I guess it's easier be mad than to endure the time apart, and we have to work on that. 
We are actually great communicators when together and I think you are giving good advise on how to proceed. Thank you."
"You need to help your mother here. She is drowning and is begging you for help. This is your father. Call the Adult Care Services hotline in your area and see what your options are. Get in touch with a social worker. Maybe you and your sister could take turns having your father over for a weekend at a time, just to give your poor mother a break."
There are people who don't like me that treat me with more respect than your friend. He's defective. Lose him.
"Because he wears shirts with patterns, duh"
"Thank you, i appreciate this a lot &lt;3

honestly yes I do hide how she treats me, but I thought it was more to protect my ego. No guy likes to appear whipped by their girlfriend. I made a lot of excuses for her to my friends.

I do believe all those things but I think it's my fault not hers.. but I'm going to have a serious think about this relationship."
"I have been around her when that's happened. Me being there doesn't stop all of them. I talk them down, but then they come another day."
"""Sorry, dude, but as I told you from the beginning, this was just a fun summer fling and is now over. Do not move back for me, as I won't be available to you if you do."""
"OMG this literally happened to me. (Very similar at least). Thanksgiving last year, first big family event with my boyfriends fam. Halfway through the night I was like um...uh oh. I checked and I was ok. We went through the night, we left, we had a great talk on the way home, all was well. THEN I got out of the car and knew something was wrong. I ran to the restroom and it was awful. AND it wasn’t all new (sorry, trying to keep this the least gory as possible lol). So I started freaking out! I changed and walked out to my boyfriend in the living room. He asked, “What’s wrong?” I immediately broke down. He thought something happened with his family or he did something to bother me-I finally got it out between tears that I bled straight through my pants and it must have been prior to getting home because of the amount and how it was old and new lol. His parents house has white couches and white dining room chair cushions. I was mortified! I just KNEW something had happened and no one said anything. But he of course calmed me down and told me it probably wasn’t as bad as I thought it was then. We checked his car and nothing on the passenger seat. I couldn’t sleep that night, shoot I still have a feeling that I just sit a weird way in the car and I left their white furniture stained. All that to say, I’m at their house right now, months later, and there’s never been as much as a whisper or notion that something happened that night. Do not worry! Even if something did, if they are decent people (sounds like they are) they won’t judge. They know how the female body works. It happens! Please don’t lose sleep over it (easier said than done I know). Tell your boyfriend, I’m sure he’ll reassure you that you have nothing to worry about and even if something happened, his parents won’t hold that against you. I’m sure the meet went great and they look forward to seeing u again! Sending good vibes your way!"
Troll.
He knows it’s on the 23rd. And he hasn’t given me a birthday gift or Christmas gift. He told me not to buy him anything on Christmas or his birthday because he wasn’t getting me anything because of husband lack of money. But it isn’t the gift I want i just want effort

"Slight update: We did talk about it earlier today, and unfortunately, it was the latter. Vee was hoping that, because of our past, I would up and leave, or cheat on my husband. And now my eyes are open to the reality that there truly is no way to deal with it, other than letting go. If he isn’t willing to let go, then I have to cut him off for my relationship."
"&gt;“I cant do this anymore, I cant have this conversation”

I know these sorts of statements are probably fairly hollow, but really look at what he is saying. He is saying that discussing things and communicating with you is something he can't do anymore. He is just dismissing issues you think are important. He is saying to be in a relationship with him you'll have to deny those things or tiptoe around them.

And maybe that is something you need to get real about. It is a year in, it seems like you have constant issues, and you can't even communicate about them without him dismissing it and making you feel bad. Is this a dynamic that has a future given he has spent most of the relationship trying different ways to avoid discussion?

So call him out. 'Are you saying you'd rather give up on the relationship then discuss this matter properly?' Because what else is he really saying in the end."

"Yes, maybe the answer is to be very specific about what you will do. And maybe also brace yourself with a back-up plan for when baby turns 5 and isn't so much fun for an immature mommy any more."
"Honestly in this time you should work on yourself as well. If she let's you be there for her, great. But if you feel she is stringing you along, leave it be. There is no rule that you cant work on yourself while you're with someone you love. Who knows what if she gets better and then decides it isnt you she wants? Then you ""wasted"" weeks, months, years, waiting for her. I know how this feels and it's horrible and it will eat you alive. Maybe try talking with a therapist about it. You dont want to lose yourself while she finds herself."
"LOL

You know I think of you like a brother...right???"
"If you are not prepared to be single mom, have you thought of adoption?  Of course I don’t know anything about your situation but I wish you the best of luck."
"You’re probably right. I have seen a few therapists but I haven’t gotten much from it. It might be I haven’t found the right one. 
I know it’s not the right way to go about it but I don’t really care much about what goes on over there. 
I’ll definitely talk to my brother about that though and let him handle the situation."
"oof. I never even thought of it like this, but now that I hear this, I think you might be right. People are often surprised to find out we're together, but he never acts like it bothers him and I never let people talk shit about his career (and I respect him a lot), so I guess it didn't occur to me that he might feel insecure."
Your step-daughter sounds like a moron.
"The sooner the better man. Eventually you are going to have to tell her, and if it is a dealbreaker it is better for it to happen now than in a few months after more feelings have begun to set in."
" Dude sounds like an asshole.  It's not about coping with outlooks, he's just  a jerk and it makes him feel powerful to have this over on you."

"Luckily, anyone can find out about someone being divorced by doing an online search of a state's court filings for free. 

Anymore, it's prudent to check out who you're thinking about dating *before* you actually go on the date."
"You don't owe him forgiveness. He knows ruining your things would hurt you and he wanted to hurt you so he did. He made a conscious decision like anyone can. He might have Autism, but it sounds like he also has SBS (spoiled brat syndrome). Nobody is obligated to be a punching bag for people with ""anger issues,""  no matter what excuses everyone always has for them."
"Yeah, where is the boyfriend part in all this? Two month relationship, seen each other three times, open relationship? This is just some dude getting laid whenever he's in town.

Girrrrrrrrrl, have some self-respect."
"This is great advice, you both need to think very very carefully about whether you want to go completely no contact for the short term while you both recover. This is meant to be an amazing chapter of your lives, as well as some of your happiest weeks. 

What they did is terrible &amp; the fact they think it will return to normal once you got back from honeymoon is some of the most despicable actions I've seen. Turn down any attempts to meet up with her parents citing traffic.

It will take a lot of time, but I hope you &amp; your wife can come out the other side of this together. I wish you all the best."
[removed]
"There’s a possibility she was mirroring you in an exaggerated manner. Just like how people’s posture changes to match someone with whom they are speaking. She might have overemphasized your similarities. I’m imagining something like, “You like xxxxxxx? I *LOVE* xxxxxxx!” 

I don’t intend to minimize your discomfort you’re expressing. 

I just think it’s important to realize there are selfish, manipulative, borderline sociopathic people out there who will act like your best friend if it gets them what they want."
"Well, first off, therapy for your wife and probably best couple's therapy too.

Second off, rally your family around you. Do you have an awesome family? A family who would be happy to embrace your wife closely as a part of the family? I really hope so. Maybe some women in your clan can reach out to her for a girl's day? Or, if not, maybe poke around to her friends? If you've got the funds, maybe offer to cover a spa day or something. Or, take her on an extended trip just the two of you. She needs to feel loved by her clan. And her clan is now you, your family, and her friends.

Her family is scum."
"I think you're making the bigger mistake by backing out of your move agreement just so you can move back your family, tbh. Especially as he hates your hometown. I think he's right not to want to get engaged while long distance. You love him enough to want the status of a ring and engagement, but not enough to live with him? I'd be putting the whole thing on hold."
"OP - I hope you realize what you’re doing requires more creativity than some jackass putting colorful clothes together, or doing art on the side. 

To most people (who aren’t trying to lift themselves up by putting you down), your achievement is great. 

It’s just sad that the person belittling you and putting you down, is the person you’re trying to build a life with."
"Dinner? Serve them dog food. No, that’s too good for them."
You can’t spend your whole life living a lie. Would you really want her to stay with you out of pity if it was the other way around?
"Thank you for reminding me of this, you're absolutely right. I got too caught up in my own feelings and my own past abuse (which involved, you guessed it, lying to me by omission and then being hurt I didn't pick up on the truth) to realize that Allie is still going through something immensely difficult. I should have been more thoughtful."
....and?  So she was worried her husband might get jealous and uncomfortable.  That doesn't mean she didn't want to have the threesome.
"Nobody can pretend to be in love with someone for their whole life.  So what you are effectively suggesting is that it would be better for you to inflict the soul crushingly slow pain of spending years with you as you slowly stop pretending to love her, maybe after knocking her up and getting her tied to you financially; rather than the sharp brief pain of breaking up with her now.

And I promise, regardless of how her love-struck mind might think you are ""the love of her life"" or ""the only one for me"", you aren't the only person she'll ever love and if you break up and go away, she'll be fine and eventually be able to move on to someone else."
"If you can not live truthfully, who are you?"
"Yes, I agree that you don’t offer to pay and then change your mind and ask for the money. Since it is a small amount maybe it’s better to pay it. Is the friendship worth more than the principle?"
"The angry and bitter side of me wants you to post their names and addresses so every single one of us can mail them a letter sharing our thoughts about them.

But as noted elsewhere. Keep up with the therapy. Best wishes."

"Have you considered that they're protesting your relationship? Not that it matters, because you'll be great together. 

Your wife needs to be happy with what she has in you, get over what she's lost in her old family. It takes time."
"Your poor wife, that's so horrible. I just can't believe how anyone can behave like this! The love you and your family and friends are showing will bring her out of this and make her realise what pieces of shits her family are.  

Are they aware of how ill she is because of their actions?"
"They sound like her parents may be narcissistic.. especially since you mentioned her and her brother had two very different experiences being raised....I just can’t imagine good people doing anything like that. She is obviously going through accepting that her parents are not good people and it’s heartbreaking for her. 

But as someone said above, this is above the advice of reddit. Therapy is the only thing that can continue to work, she obviously is grieving the loss of an event she wanted to be wonderful, the loss of parents who should’ve been there, and the loss of a magical honeymoon as well. She is probably working through a lot of other things and is just disassociating because it’s too much to work through at once."
"Woman here. In my experience, if guys want to marry you, they will be enthusiastic about it. It shouldn't be leading to arguments. If he has specific doubts, he should be bringing them up. And if he can't name them or won't accept that it's important to you, then he doesn't have the emotional maturity to be getting married."
"That needs a lot of context and ofc a therapist can only handle it. 

Was your wife so far the golden child? Did that came out of nowhere for her? Did she had a good relationship with her siblings or did they despise her?

Something very similar happened in my family and I can sense some similarities. I could be deadly wrong though cause it sounds super complicated situation."
"A very good summation, I would walk away. The disrespect to you two as a couple is immense, and even more so to her individually"
"Considering all the chaos going on now, I bet your parents have done other things most people wouldn’t consider normal. You accept them because you didn’t know anything different. The latest developments are way across the line. Eventually you’ll need to find a therapist to sort this all out. When you get back into college take advantage of mental health services. 

Do your best to move out and live independently. Teach your brother skills you will learn about finding an apartment, protecting personal credit, hiding money from your parents, holding down a job while going to college, etc. He will likely struggle while he’s in high school but can follow your example. 

Take care of yourself first. You won’t be able to help your brother until you feel a little more stable. He’s not in imminent physical danger so he can survive another year or two with your emotional support."
"You can contact your local police department and have an officer present while he gets his things out of your apartment.  With his anger issues and refusal to respect your wishes for a breakup, this might be a necessary precaution.    


If you are uncomfortable with law enforcement I recommend a few good friends (preferably strong ones)"
"Well, all you know right now is that Irene is \*an\* ex, not \*the\* ex in question. If Allie isn't comfortable sharign the details or hasnt' told you anything specifically about it, I don't know if it's necessary to go out of your way to get clarification."
"Get some distance from this friend, let him stay your boyfriends housemate and your casual acquaintance. 
 
But he hasn't technically done anything wrong here. You admit that you dont confide in this friend much , so maybe he didn't feel comfortable approaching you about a personal fight ? Either way, keep your distance henceforth and focus on your relationship. All the best."
"Do not delay in getting your insurance changed. If it's employer-provided life events are one of the reasons you can change coverage,  so you want to get that done quick."
"&gt;Your friend went out with someone he knew you were seeing, and I don't think that's something that friends do. 

It kinda sounds like ""friend"" took it as a challenge that this woman might have actually been genuinely interested in OP and decided to swoop in, which is beyond shitty and puts this guy in Absolute Biscuit territory."
"Just wondering- did either you or your wife respond when the brother and parents let you know they weren't coming? Did anyone say ""this means a lot to (wife) and we'd really appreciate you still trying to come"" or explain that she essentially changed her dream wedding for them? Not trying to blame OP or wife, but if my brother texted that he was 'too tired' to come to my wedding after working as a LIBRARIAN the day before, I would get on the phone with him and explain to him that this isn't optional."
"Perhaps just spending more quality time together talking can help him to feel closer. I wasn’t feeling close to my boyfriend for a while. We spent more time sharing a glass of wine and just talking, no TV or anything like that. We took turns picking songs to listen to, held each other and just talked. This helped me to feel closer to him. I am not sure if this is what your husband needs but it can’t hurt to try it."
"Hi, I don’t have an answer for you but I just wanted to say that you’re not selfish for having these thoughts.  I hope that you’re able to put your own mental health first and set boundaries around what you’re doing to help your partner. Wishing you luck!"
"Definitely keep doing therapy. I’m so sorry that your wife’s family ruined your day. 

Have you explained to them why this is completely unacceptable and how you guys rearranged the wedding to accommodate them? Frankly, this would be the end of any relationship I had with my family if they pulled something like this the day of my wedding, but obviously that’s your wife’s call."
"Honestly, it's quite possible that he is right. It sounds from your post and some of your comments like they were cold &amp; indifferent parents who created an unstable life for their kids just because they felt like it. It could be that your wife has been in denial about their failings, and her brother has a more realistic view. Maybe he's angry at her for being in denial, and feels she takes their parents side on things."
"Ah, I should have been more specific: Sam told me explicitly that Irene was the ex with whom Allie had the bad breakup."
"I agree with everyone, your wife should really talk to a therapist about this :( what they did was horrible - it’s still extremely fresh, no wonder your wife is still this devastated. Has her family reached out at all? Have they spoken at all? If they have not apologized at all, I would go no contact. 

I remember really vividly as a kid, my aunt got married overseas to her pen pal. Didn’t tell anyone in the family. I’ll never forget the utter devastation my grandma went through. She didn’t get to go to her first borns wedding (sidenote: my grandmother is the sweetest woman ever, who doesn’t have a single mean bone in her body. My mom and all her siblings will attest to her being an amazing mom). My aunt is cool, but honestly a really careless person and didn’t consider my grandmas feelings at all. 

My grandma laid around the house wailing like a banshee, inconsolable for a month. I had never seen her cry in my life, but eventually - time healed it. She just has the worst wedding luck. The night before my OTHER aunts wedding, my aunts MIL attacked my grandma and tried to choke her, unprovoked (because she hates my aunt and is racist), and then during my uncles wedding, she was delirious from being so ill from an untreated UTI, so she didn’t remember any of it. The only wedding she really got to enjoy was my moms. The poor woman deserved none of it. And those kinds of events are so important to her and she’s a joy to have at them. 

I’m not saying it’ll happen for your wife, but with therapy and time hopefully it’ll get better for her. My grandma saw a counsellor through her work. I’m so sorry your shitty in-laws actions over shadowed your special day and hurt your wife so bad :("
"My partner and I also changed our plans for the wedding reception in order to accommodate my family, and it was just … the tip of the iceberg in terms of underlying family dysfunction that led to them bullying me throughout the day. 

It really fucking hurts. There was very little my partner was able to do when I was dealing with the emotional fallout of it all. Keep working closely with her therapist or her mental health team if it turns out she needs more intensive care. You're a good husband, and all you can do is be there for her and let her know she is good and loved and precious to you (and to so many other people!), if not to her family."
"It sounds like you both need therapy. I'm so, so sorry. Damn. I can't even imagine. I have been that depressed, unfortunately. Don't leave her. Just trust me on that.

You are an amazing person to feel like this about her. You sound like an amazing spouse and support for your wife. She may not show it, but she knows that you and your family and friends are there for her. She needs that. She may not react to it (I didn't), but she knows deep down inside that people care for her.

Please just continue therapy for both of you. I hope things get better."
"Oh my god you need to stop imagining that you’re so important to all of these women that ending it with them will ruin their lives. Not to be rude, but *they will be fine*. People get rejected and broken up with all of the time. It will suck, sure, but it won’t be the end of the world.

You act like you’re being so kind to your gf by not breaking up with her and “not hurting her”, but in reality, every day you stay with her when you don’t love her is going to hurt her more. No one is capable of hiding something like this, it’ll come up at some point. It’s WAY WAY better for her to know now instead of years from now."
"This. This. This. Sounds like a dbag w little respect for women. If he has to prove/project his dominance, his ego is a fragile flaccid squid and you should run girl."
"You can understand his anxiety, np.

You shouldn’t carry the consequences of his mental abuse, though.

You posted so much and lost time and energy (no blame from me). With a kind and loving partner you would instead have sat together, maybe with friends and have them amazed for this piece of art. 

You would have and would have had a good time, laugh and be excited, proud and happy and you deserve that."
Only bad things could’ve come from meeting with him in person.
4 people didn't show up in this age range. The 35 is probably her brother.
He mentioned her feelings after the threesome and she stated that she felt this is how she thought her husband would react.
"Some people who are just beginning to heal from abusive relationships aren't likely to go all in on details while everything is new and fresh and they're moving through processing. I don't think Allie ""obscured the truth"" for any reason other than this may be too difficult for her to talk about. She doesn't owe you an explanation of her past relationships until she's ready to give it."
"Yeah a lot of kids taken care of by nannies instead of being toted to pre school have a much later bed time. My cousins (I'm a nanny as well) were all 930 bed timers because they had a later start to the day, my aunt uncle were staying up that late but getting up for work between 330 and 5am due to commute and the intensity of their corporate jobs, just so they could spend time with their kiddos. Every family is different. I also know a lot of parents who learn their kid will not fall asleep if there is still light outside, so bed times get pushed for that as well. All families are different, we can't all have the classic picket fence life."
"My dad use to say the same thing!  

I’m mid 30s now, but I did end up moving away and cutting him out of my life for years. But then cancer strikes, and you wonder if you did the right thing and you start to feel like shit, so you open up to him again....then you realize fuck yes, you did the right thing, and some relationships aren’t meant to be, and that’s okay. 

Sometimes closure is realizing they serve as an example of how *not* to parent, and you have to move on. 

I don’t know if that will be your experience too, but realize you’re not alone, and it’s not about you."
"Anybody who says ""it's a joke!"" to avoid being confronted on shit behavior isn't joking."
In a comment he said that she's not close to any of her extended family because her parents moved the family around constantly as a kid for no particular reason and didn't visit with relatives.
This is not healthy and not ok. He has jealousy and anger issues. He’s warning you and showing who he is. Do not stay. No one that is safe and loves you says or jokes about this
"This 👆👆👆 and get your broke ""friend"" picker fixed!"
"Yeah, but he did back off a bit after I called I’m out on his bs. I figured that was nice at least."
"And even if she does need inpatient care, an involuntary hold isn't needed for that, if she's willing to go."
"Man I can relate a lot to what you just described. Question - does your wife's family get out of the house much? They kinda sound like a family of introverts afraid to leave the house, maybe due to agoraphobia or something. My family is a lot like this. Hell, I am a lot like this. Every time I have a planned event I fight with myself whether to go or not. That's not to say any of what's been done is justified, it's not. No matter how much I might not want to go to a planned event, no matter how much my family might not want to go somewhere, we'd never skip out on something like this. Not a wedding for an immediate family member. A distant cousin maybe, but definitely not a daughter/sister. What they've done is unforgivable. That's a moment in time they missed and can never be part of. And that's devastating to your wife, especially if these are the few people she believes even care about her. Really sucks man. I think the best thing here is therapy, like everyone else is saying. There's nothing that's going to fix the fact that they missed the wedding. Now it's about dealing with it and the emotional toll that takes, and only therapy and lots of love can help her heal."
My heart sank while reading this post. You are trying really hard to take care of her and its great that your family is helping as much as they can. Don't give up!
"Your wife feels abandoned because she was abandoned. Worse, she feels unloved because her own damn family couldn't be arsed enough to show up for her wedding. This is likely the culmination of a lifetime of feeling like she was unloved by these assholes and now here's the proof that they don't love her. She went out of her way to accommodate them and they still can't love her the way she needed them to love her. That's going to hurt. That stoicism she has shown before? That was her way of stuffing any hurt down. Now that she's been confronted by her family's hurtful behaviour in front of everyone, she can't keep on denying that hurt. 

As others have said, keep up with the therapist. If her depressive state persists, she might even need medication. If you are concerned for her safety, you may have to consider hospitalization. Absolutely keep reassuring her that **you** and your family love her. We can't choose the families we are born into, but when we are adults, we can choose and build the families we want and need. Remind her that you have chosen her to be part of your family."
Your friends and family sound like jerks.
"It was the right thing to do, super respectful to your new partner, if I were him I would be thinking ""wow I really found myself a great girl"""
"The difference is pretty small in terms of money, but not in terms of alcohol. I'd had drunk more if I had paid for myself. Plus, at my own pace and what I wanted to, not what everyone else wanted. 
The issue is not the money, the issue is not asking anyone and asking money back when you ""invited them""."
"The funny thing about this is that if you ask most working artists what the highest, ultimate goal of their work is, I don't know how many would just say ""to be creative."" 

Maybe it's just me, but that's not really a stated goal of most art. While I totally believe that there is value for my life in being generally creative, that is REALLY separate from the goals or aims of a piece of art. For example, I'm a choreographer...it'd be easy to just be creative with my movement through improvisation. But what would I achieve with the audience if my only goal was to be creative? They probably would say ""well....that was interesting"" and feel like they just didn't get it. In my experience, my art is more successful when I am actually using it as a form of communication for something other than just....arting itself? 

Not that there can't be non-narrative art. Totally! And there can also be art that is simply valuable because it displays the virtuosity in technical ability of the performer or composer. 

But I definitely view ""creativity"" as a means to a different end. Usually mine is to communicate some human truth to my audience. I don't give a shit if ""creativity"" is conveyed to them, as long as they get my actual message. 

Sorry, I don't intend to gate-keep in the other direction - it just seems that Davis has given you a really limited idea of what working artists are like and what they think creativity is and I wanted to share my actual approach to potentially shed light on possibilities."
"
Is there a possibility they don't like you and that is why they did their silent protest of the wedding?"
"Yes definitely. Creative and cocky people are the worst. True ""creative"" people actually have a soul and encourage others, especially their loved ones and they are eager to learn from someone else's perspective. 

Definitely defective."
"
Yea thanks, I get D World and D Land confused.

That's even worse then!  CA has so many great outdoor activities and locations, and weather.  Traffic may be bad but just plan to start the trip early."
"I find it very difficult to maintain feelings of attraction and to continue to be vulnerable around someone when they get trashed and act in an unstable way.  Especially if it happens multiple times.  

I had a boyfriend I really loved and cared about but one night he literally became unhinged and freaked out which scared the crap out of me.  I just never saw him in the same way again and though we stayed together for a while after, I constantly felt anxious and uneasy around him...not to mention that he started going off like that on a fairly consistent basis.  He triggered a lot of past trauma in me and the only solution for me was to break up permanently and never look back.

Accept that your life may be less “comfortable “ for a while.  Pay your own bills and keep it moving.  You can’t force yourself to stay with someone ,if you’re not feeling it, for free WiFi."
I didn’t think I was this terrible at judging character but I guess it is what it is.
"And if you had absolutely nothing in common with her you’d be struggling g with the idea that he liked somebody that’s the opposite of you for 6 years and wanted to marry her

He picked you. End of story, I’d be more concerned with faith not being able to back off and I’d keep that boundary. Don’t relax at all with her, don’t get any kind of false sense of comfort like “well, my boyfriend doesn’t want her so I guess we can all be friends”. She doesn’t respect you or him and will try to screw him every chance she gets"
"Yeah, when this started I was imagining a smashed iPad or gaming system due to a meltdown. This was calculated."
"If he wants his daughter to spend more time with her parents, he needs to shift some of his reading on the train days, to father-daughter bonding hours. So that those days you can relax with your hobbies then you can switch off by going home earlier. 

It’s selfish of him to assume you don’t deserve recharge time when he has a daily commute that lets him recharge."
"Sounds just like my dad. 
My brother, sometimes our parents try to me us do stuff they like/couldn t when they had our age. My dad did the same, i did the same thing you do now, because he liked! But at some point you will have to tell him what bothers you, how you feel, my dad wanted me to be a fotball player cuz he couldnt, then he wanted me to be a boxer cuz he couldnt. I said “dad stop it, i dont like it, dont make me do stuff you couldnt” . And today i find myself studying to become something i love and enjoy every second. Man up, talk! Words are just words sometimes, my dad said bad things to me, but just words. Again, man up! You are not alone!"
"I will never have any respect for parents who make their children responsible for their shitty financial decisions. OP, it is not on you to provide money for them. You’re barely an adult. You need to live your own life, on your terms, for you. 

Focus on you for now OP. Do whatever you can to get out of this situation. Then, once you’re on more stable ground you can help your brother."
"She’s grieving for the family she thought she had. It will take time to accept they don’t actually exist, and are just plain assholes."
They don’t deserve to be called family any more. Family shows up.
"Is it possible that the Parents and Brother made up excuses so they didn’t have to see/confront each other at an emotionally charged event? It’s not an excuse, but it seems very much like an anxiety-related reaction to me. Maybe they were afraid they would ruin the wedding by making a scene."
"&gt; What do I do now?

Nothing. This isn't your fight. As long as you are not actively down talking either of them or getting involved in any of the problems between them, it is all good."
"Sounds like a friend that loses herself in new relationships and gravitates to more controlling guys. It's ok not to like your SOs friends. From his prospective it should be, he has a right not to like you, but if you are a good friend and not detrimental to your friend then he shouldn't get in the way of that friendship. Your friend should be able to think for herself too and evaluate your friendship on her own."
"Why don't you find a gym with a child care area? That's one simple solution to a bigger problem. 

The bigger concern is both of your priorities. There are plenty of ways to balance exercise and reading a book with being a parent. 

Your husband is gone from 8 AM to 7 PM so that he can take the train and read. Did he want to have kids and be a dad? How much time are you spending with your daughter? Did you want to be a mom? 

What are your priorities? I know it's different, but I live in San Diego and have a high energy dog. He's 7 but people think he's a puppy. 

I chose to pay $300 more than average rent to live by the dog friendly beach and cut back on other expenses. Sold my car and got something 10 grand cheaper. Cut back on restaurants and bars. I don't do expensive vacations and don't spend much on clothes. 

I got a part time job at my yoga studio and membership is down from $169 a month to about $40. If anyone is interested, Google ""corepower yoga studio experience team"". It's awesome and a great way to make friends. 

I get up at 5 AM when I could get up at 7. I walk him and then I do yoga at the beach every morning and let him run around. I see the same people every day, so I get to socialize that way. 

I only go to the studio on weekends and on days where I work from home. 

After work, I don't go out if I can't bring him. That's what my weekends are for. In the rare event that I want to go to a weekday concert, art show, or get invited to a social thing where I can't bring him, I put him in day care, work from home and spend my commuting time exercising him/walk him for breaks, or get a friend to watch him after work. 

I picked up outdoor rock climbing a few years ago partly bc I can hike there with my dog and set up a spot for him in the shade. I bring tarp and extra rope. 

Sorry to say, but it seems like you are not prioritizing your kid as much as I am prioritizing a dog."
Simply ask your friends how they'd feel if their current partner went out to see an ex that was in town. The nerve of them.
"&gt; . But he realizes that we are a team, and he knows that is not realistic.

Until he figures out that you're not and he dumps you."
"This is why you don’t sleep with people at work and share women with your friends. 

If they are not exclusive he is allowed to sleep with whoever he wants. After all she is sleeping with the both of you, why can’t he have multiple partners. Mind your own business."
"You're not going to be able to convince him to break up. He likes things the way they are. He doesn't care about what you want.

You'll need to proceed very carefully -- leaving an abusive partner is a very dangerous time for a woman. I would suggest contacting your local women's shelter to figure out the safest way for you to proceed.

You don't have to get him to agree with you to break up, that can be a unilateral decision. But, now you need to figure out the safest way to do that, and for that you will need some outside help."
"He decided y’all were going to that club for his gf’s bday. If he wanted to be paid for those things, he should’ve asked those involved if they were down to split costs. He didn’t and so he’s on the hook. Up to you if you wanna shoot him cash or not but I don’t think you owe him anything. For comparison, I was out w my former roommate for her bday. I invited my ex gf bc she and my former roommate got along well. While out, ex gf order fancy mixed 8 shots for the table, and then proceeded to act like we all had to pay for ours even tho we didn’t order them. I didn’t pay and neither did 2 others. Lesson to her and to your friends bf. Don’t take out costs you expect others to cover, without asking them first. Pretty basic actually."
"I mean, I hate weddings. But holy shit I can't believe they were a no show. Poor form that. Hope you're wife is ok in the end."
"There are so many single pieces that might mean nothing alone, but taken together I think your wife’s childhood was severely screwed up. Look up the golden child/scapegoat dynamic and see if any of that resonates. Often one child will take on the “job” of verbalizing that there are actual problems going on in the family...and be soundly shunned and treated like those are their own personal problems. 

I don’t want to judge anyone else for how they express grief, but the amount of stoicism you’re describing in your wife is beyond the pale. 2 weeks of crying is extreme, but these might be the tears for the cat and everything else she’s had to suppress coming to the surface. I think you are right to follow her therapist’s lead in how to cope with this, but if you can check in with a physician as well that would probably be appropriate."
How is that going to solve anything though? I think he’d be the asshole here.
"Idk, when they started sleeping together and I dont care. In many european countries 15 and 21 would be legal too just saying. But sure the lower the are the creepier and more often illegal it gets. Surprise.

In any case they are married now and they seem fine. If you want to make some enemies go ahead stirr more. If I were your bf I would probably want you to let this go."
"As with everyone else, I've offered receipts of actual conversation between both my boyfriend and the artist. Y'all love to say people are lying in this sub when it's intended for advice, not detective work.

The artist wanted to massively take their time with the piece so they could use it as a sponsored post and more advertisement for themselves. Frankly, if I wanted to use something as a piece to represent myself I would put more time into it.
It's also not about the size. I could also send you pictures of the 20+ colors they used in the tattoo.
There is insanely small detail put in it to make it look the way it does. Just because you visibly can't tell doesn't mean the effort wasn't there?

Also as I've said a few times. He took (1) break. Which, I didn't use because I was flipped over and didn't want to get off the bed.

I have to be real out of all the comments on this post the ones that really catch my attention are the ones that pin my post as fraud. Believe what you want I guess."

"Why is having been married more serious than having slept with many (say more than 30) partners or having been in a relationship for 4 years with the same person? I get why you’re saying a lie of omission is shady, what I want to know is why having been in a marriage is looked down on more than having a slutty phase or being in a committed relationship that was basically a marriage."
"Sending multiple angry drunk texts.  Not respecting others boundaries.  Your roommate saying it's the drink talking.  Drinking to deal with tough times + emotional instability + the above behaviour, is pretty ripe recipe for alcoholism."
"You would ‘prefer’ to be involved may have been a little confusing. Don’t get me wrong, they ‘probably ‘ shouldn’t have, but you need to be more vocal about your expectations."
"Frequently after having kids, women can have bladder issues. Maybe she had a little leak and was embarrassed by it"
"How would it not help? I mean, she’s be seemingly protected from getting with just another douche bag in her life considering she just got out of a cheating relationship."
"I would seriously consider not attending the wedding under these circumstances. You've been together for *seven* years, and they clearly aren't drawing the line at engaged or married couples only. 

The couple seem like tacky people imo."
"&gt;we also moved together in order to save some money

Gotcha--yeah, rent seems to be freaking impossible in so many places! But I think you should take this experience seriously and reevaluate this relationship."
Support and strength in numbers is enough. Her parents are the most likely to support OP in this way unless they have a broken relationship.
You described my relationship with my dad to a T. Always have been his favorite. He lives 10 mins away and I see him maybe 3 times a year...Christmas Eve being one...just to drop gifts off for myself and his grandkids (I also insist he doesn't do this but alas he equates Christmas and birthday gifts as effort...so I equate it to his love for us)
"""I will now show you how I feel through the medium of interpretive dance"" and then just sway with both middle fingers up."
"I dont have much advise but wanted to say that I am so very sorry that your wife (and you) had to experience that on your wedding day! The audacity of some people is beyond.

 A very similar situation happened to me when I got married in 2016 and I still harbor resentment towards my father over it. Long story short, my dad has always been largely absent from my life and would only pop back in when it was convenient for him. My mom died in 2014 and he tried to be there for me for about a month until he got tired of me again, I guess. Hes just an all out piece of shit to sum it up, lol. Thankfully, my grandfather stepped in from the day I was born and will always been my dad in my eyes, so naturally I asked him to walk me down the aisle. My ""real dad"" was never an option. Come wedding day the ceremony starts and I see my dad and his wife sitting in the back row and he looks pissed--i knew exactly why he was sulking and tried to not let it get to me, only to find out at the reception that he left as soon as we said our vows and went home. Made a big fucking scene to anyone who would listen that he should have been the one giving me away, I was mortified and hurt. My aunt told him to get lost and I'm just sad I missed that part lol. I dont know why I'm sharing this I guess if only to say I know a similar hurt to the pain your wife is feeling and it is likely more significant than you can deal with on your own, no offense at all. My husband tried to be there for me after our wedding but since his family was still one unit, he just didnt understand and could only confirm my bitching and name calling lol. He helped me find a good therapist and has been supportive of whatever needs I have had through the years. I wish nothing but the best for you and your wife!"
"They hate leaving the house. Oftentimes they will go the dollar store instead of the grocery store just to avoid the crowds. It drives my wife crazy, because they buy so much junk food when they do and she compulsively eats it and ends up gaining weight that takes weeks to lose."
[removed]
"This sounds like one or more family members might have a mental illness like agoraphobia that makes leaving the house a terrifying proposition.

Either that, or they felt intimidated by the fact that you have money and didn't want to deal with your wealthy family and friends."
"Why are you so hard on yourself bro ? Life itself means more than just one person. You have done things wrong, but you have to learn from mistakes so you won't do it again. Your past relationship were absolute wreck because you probably were a wreck yourself. A positive life can only come together with a positive mind."
"From someone who has dealt with this exact issue from my own family, the sooner your wife accepts that she will never make them happy and cuts them out of her life, the better it will be for her own happiness. 

None of my family showed up at my wedding. None of them showed up at the reception. None of them said congratulations or sent gifts. They all pretended like it never happened. I was even uninvited from my younger brother’s wedding because my mother didn’t want me there. All of my life I had spent trying to make these people love me and cutting them out of my life has been the best thing for my new family. My kids never have to be around toxic people and I‘m happy for that. 

Like others have said, therapy would help. It will be hard at first for her to deal with not having a “family” but remind her that this time she gets to make a new family with people she wants to be there and that love her. Block them on social media and block their phone numbers. Then maybe redo your wedding at the other venue so it will be a fresh start for your lives together."
"I have to agree that this sounds more like psychiatrist and clinical psychologist territory than a therapist presumably less equipped to deal with more severe mental health issues. Two weeks of crying and being in a ""vegetative"" state is definitely serious enough to have a stint as an inpatient in a psychiatric facility, especially if your wife has a family history of bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses. It's possible that what her family did has acted as a stressor and caused some latent psychiatric issues to come to the surface. Even if she didn't expect her parents to ever do anything this shitty, her reaction is still really extreme. 

Also, since you both didn't get to have the wedding you wanted, maybe you guys can plan to do the resort ceremony and have another honeymoon on your one year anniversary. I hope she's feeling well soon."
 Could I also please have the list of questions?
The thought has crossed my mind :(
"I did, thanks. ❤️"
"Were there any particular objections/complaints raised by your wife's family members prior to the wedding?

I'm not excusing their behaviour which is inexcusable, but it might provide some insight as to why they bailed out the way they did.  The excuses they provided were weak at best, so they may have been trying to cover something else."
"Congratulations on your marriage! I hope you both live a long, happy life together and that her family no longer gets in the way of that. How selfish of them to make you and your wife’s special day about them."
I think you'll find a lot of these relationships are abusive.
"You need to start educating yourself about the after effects of childhood abuse.

I'm afraid a lot of this was predictable, and you accidentally enabled your wife's trauma instead of supporting her in healing.

Her refusal to cry is a big red flag of serious emotional problems in childhood. You've now got 29 years worth of tears and pain coming up violently.  

Forgoing *her dreams for their comfort*, again part of her trauma. Those were the actions of a broken, frightened child desperate for parental approval. 

I'll bet money there's a ton of toxic vullshit you didn't recognize while she was living at home.

If you'd been able to see all of this, you could have helped ease this process and maybe even ripped this bandaid off before the wedding so she could enjoy her big day.

The first year of marriage is going to be a painful and difficult process as she gets the distance from her family she needs to face the trauma and faces that pain in deeper and deeper layers.

Which is predictable, but I'm guessing you didn't know to plan on.

And I don't say any of this in a blaming way. You aren't her therapist. 

Just in a ""educate yourself because a little knowledge would've helped everyone'.

You've actually got the best case scenario here in a lot of ways. 

You also did perfectly by bringing a therapist in.

You're a good husband and with your support she's going to be okay.

This is just goih to deeply, deeply suck in ways you need to prepare yourself for."
"Sounds like you're on the right track.  Listen, these people are going to be a part of your life for the next whatever amount of years they/you got left on this planet.  I'm not saying excuse the behavior, I'm saying that holding a seething level of anger is only going to hurt YOU.  They obviously could care less if you're upset with them or not.  Continue therapy, continue progress, and make your life better in spite of what some asshat level fuckfaces do with their time."
"Awesome! :D Insurance in the US seems an absolute nightmare...even if you have it and theoretically shouldn't have to worry about exorbitant medical bills bankrupting you, it's so complicated and restricted! Finding an in network doctor, making sure all bloodwork is done through in network labs, checking for hospitalisations that not only the hospital but the procedure(s), doctor(s), anaesthesiologists etc are all covered...and if you mess up (because geez, maybe you're sick and struggling) then oh well, patient's responsibility to be sure everything's covered! Now pay up $300 for the antibiotic that costs $0.80 to manufacture :) I don't know how you do it..."
"As far as the school goes, make an appointment to speak with the teacher yourself and let her know you are mom and dads girlfriend lives elsewhere and is NOT mom."
"Why do you have to do the fighting? Why isn't he fighting for himself?

This is going to sound harsh, but it is not your job to fix him. For all you know he'll get it together once there's no one around to do the work for him--it sounds like you do enable him a bit."
Are they possibly upset that you are stealing their favourite from them? That she's going to be out from under their roof and/or their influence?
"I think the two of you need to sit down and discuss what you want out of life. Your moving back home to be by your family to a hometown you admit he hates. Do you expect to live there forever? I somehow don’t think he’s going to want that. 

The simple fact is marriage is about compromise but it’s also about two people being on the same page about things. You don’t marry someone who wants kids when you adamantly don’t. You also don’t marry someone who doesn’t want to leave their hometown when you hate living there. I think fundamentally you guys want different things but neither of you want to admit that this isn’t going to work. Eventually one of you will just end up resenting the other for what you had to give up."
"I wouldn't say that normally quiet/reserved people hate the world. Nothing wrong with being either. That seems pretty misguided, since there's tons of quiet people and most aren't filled with any real hatred. Most of us are just minding our own business. But more to the point, hardship and abuse (including the mental/emotional kind) will show in people- it always does. In different ways sometimes, but it'll show. You just have to know how to see it, because although there are common patterns, it's different in every person you meet. 

Her being quiet may just be a level of introversion. That's just natural, really. Same with her seeing the world as ""good"", however she defines that. Her being distrustful, closed off, etc. could've been symptoms of how she's grown up though. Or also, even that she sees the world as good and just- sometimes, we recognize our own circumstances are abnormal and we see the rest of the world as a symbol of hope or something better. Really, it's hard to say without knowing your wife, and I don't want to keep guessing and taking shots in the dark. But hopefully, with some professional help, you can both cope with the problems this has caused. At least immediately, understanding her quirks is less of a priority than coping with what would be a huge personal tragedy to her. Continuing therapy will also be a benefit, as it can help her deal with her feelings on the matter as time goes on."
"You are not getting the full story. It sounds to me like they might have asked her for money and she said no, and that’s why they didn’t come. They sound like garbage people, regardless."
I would say: *Let me make it easier for you by not attending.*
"Op please do this. It would be a serious lesson for your mom, and she definetively needs one."
"I can't fathom how people get shit like this, but I guess the technology exists and you just told me there are people who do that... so shit, I guess that's a thing. *slowly drags hand over face* 
*massages head* *sigh*"
You're not respecting her relationship if you tell her.  Keep it to yourself and move on.

Hi! Morning radio DJ and Dance/Drama Teacher here.

DUMP THIS JERK! (Edited)

I live a VERY creative life that includes art of many disciplines. Most of the time, I'm encouraging people who are less creative or artistically inclined to give themselves permission to try. I grew up hearing ""wow I could never do that, I'm not artistic like that"" and while growing up and especially now that I teach kids, my response has always been ""I'm able to do this because I decided to try it. I am sure you are just as capable at something like this with the right practice!""

I think your boyfriend is potentially insecure about some things:

**A) His own creativity:** simply because people who are confident in their skills have no reason to point out the lack of the same skill in others. If I were confronted by someone claiming to be an artist and I heard or saw them speak in this way about people who haven't dedicated their lives and livlihoods to acutely artistic pursuits, they would immediately be on my ""hah - never working with you"" shit list. He's very likely not as ""wildly creative"" as he wants people (including you) to think he is.

**B) His actual utility to society:** Let's be real, making it on art is hard - that's why he's a bartender. I'm not doing it the way I would want to ideally. The majority of my post-college jobs have been places in which I make the case that my creative skills and performance production background make me excellent under pressure and highly adaptive in problem solving situations. Which is true and gets me jobs that pay my bills -BUT! it is also a constant thought of ""maybe I should quit everything and try to actually go for it"" or ""maybe I should have dedicated some of my degree to such-and-such?"" - in other words, unless you are hired constantly as an artist who is making good money, it's a path that can induce a lot of self-questioning. But there's really no reason for someone to take that out on you - that's inappropriate, especially since...

**C) You are too much of a BAMF for him:** You are 3 years his junior and very clearly much more mature than he is. You also have carved yourself a very stable and productive niche in this society, and most of all, it sounds like you are very content with what you are doing! Very threatening to a weak person.

I'm heated about this too because I really really disagree with how your boyfriend characterizes artistic work. There are a lot of potential rules in art - it's actually really important to my composition process to ""find the rules"" of a given piece (and by my training, that's not super unusual) because when you are composing, you are world building and every world has rules. Even if the rules are ""there are no rules""! Maybe I'm just the academic wank of artistic practice, but I wouldn't take your boyfriend seriously if I heard him say these things. I wouldn't be convinced he was taking it seriously enough."
"I’m really sorry you’re dealing with this. I don’t have any advice, but I’m giving your wife a big old mom hug right now. Please keep us updated."
"I'm so sorry, this is awful for both of you. It sounds like your wife has been managing to cope in her own way for a long time, and this big event has caused everything to rush to the surface all at once. That is a hell of an emotional eruption for anyone to deal with. I'm glad you're getting her support - this is going to take a team of people (including your wife herself, you as her partner, her friends, the therapist, doctors, etc.) a good amount of time to work through. This may feel like the worst possible start to your marriage, but you have the opportunity to build a secure, happy life together from the rubble you're looking at right now. I wish you both luck.

P.S. Make sure you're getting good support too."

"Hey, everyone's sucked a dick once"
"My parents never turned up for anything of mine. I still remember my final year of high school prize giving. I won a General Knowledge prize and begged my parents to come (it was about a 40 minute drive), but their excuse was that it would take too long to get there and they had to go grocery shopping that day. They never came to a sports day or any other school function. I had a chance to swim competitively for my country but it would have meant my mother getting up at 6 every morning to drive me to swim practice and she wasn't willing to do that so I lost the opportunity. 

They turned up to my sister's wedding but my dad got so drunk in his speech he called my sister's husband by my then boyfriend's name. Shitty parents are shitty. They're both dead now, but I still resent the hell out of them. 

I'm so sorry your wife is going through this. As others have said, she needs a therapist and she needs to go on /r/raisedbynarcissists . She's not alone."
This sucks. But once the grieving has settled have the wedding you wanted. Just the two of you (and maybe one or very close friends) and surprise her with it. Just my thoughts.
Absolutely. The Facebook thing is actually the most concerning here.
"You are obviously not a teacher.     The teacher is being overly familiar with this student.   As I said, it happens with new teachers and it is not a good thing. 

It's not about a possible grooming situation, the teacher is simply not maintaining appropriate, professional boundaries."
He doesn’t love you. If he did he wouldn’t treat you this way. Respect yourself and leave this guy in your permanent rear view mirror.
[removed]
"She obviously wasn't feeling the same connection you did, and that sucks, but it happens. At the end of the day she doesn't owe you anything and she didn't fuck you over, you just had two different experiences of the same night."
I get that. I guess I'm just blindly hoping to fall into that tiny bracket where the age gap is kinda irrelevant to the whole relationship and it ends up working out great
"&gt;BUT also says it's complicated, I wouldn't understand, and I'm imagining things.

He's in denial about his own behavior here.  Over half of all affairs develop between co-workers just this way.  

*Not Just Friends* by Shirley Glass   Read it asap and have him do that too.  Then discuss his recent involvement with this woman in that context."
"&gt;I blocked him, am I the asshole?

Good and no, not even close to being an asshole.    This guy was never your friend."
"Send her out for milk, tell her to walk to the store, it's just around those trees over there...then lock the doors and wear headphones."
"Yes, I was."
"I’ve read this is common in long-distance relationships. You don’t see each other so you miss each other, you become frustrated and eventually that can turn into apathy. Maybe it’s a sort of defence-mechanism? It’s easier to throw yourself into work and other activities and put the person whom you love in the back of your head so you wouldn’t think about how terribly you miss them. Your brain wants to save itself from that hurt so it convinces you to be indifferent. 

I’ve also read that ALL of that can change when you finally see each other and spend a couple of days together - their presence makes you remember all those good feelings and reasons you love them again. There are aspects to a relationship that facetime/texting just can’t relay (body language, smell, taste, touch), all of which can ”trigger” the loving emotions back.

Of course, that could be just part of the problem. It’s good that you (M) are focusing on yourself and going on a path to better your self-esteem - I believe it will help both of you to see you in a different, better light. Maybe that alone can make her be more attracted to you again.

Then there’s a third thing - the honeymoon phase. It is common the ”love hormones” and neurotransmitters start to fade away after 1.5-2 years. That’s why so many people break up at that point. If the only thing keeping you together are FEELINGS, adoring each other, then it only makes sense that when they fade the relationship is doomed. However, that’s not the only thing that keeps people together: shared goals, working well together, the same sense of humour, being good friends and good communication skills can very well be enough to keep going even when you don’t FEEL like it. You can CHOOSE to love another even when you don’t feel it. You can CHOOSE to try and make it work if other aspects of the relationship are fulfilling enough - oftentimes the feelings follow and later on you can feel it again.

There might be other things that has put off your gf, but I’m sure if you keep talking and figuring things out they will reveal themselves. People nowadays tend to give up very easily and search for that high (from those hormones/neurotransmitters) elsewhere. I’m not saying that’s neccessarily a bad thing - I’m sure it works the some people who don’t want to be with one person for long. For other people though, they realise the grass is not actually greener, and they yearn for security, comfort and commitment. And that’s not achieved by changing the partner, but rather working through your problems with your partner if the relationship is good on all fronts except the emotional side. 

Wishing you well, whatever you may decide to do."
Ask him about his favorite restaurant or food and book a table at a nice spot.
Never quit a job until you have a new one!

Maybe get a dog?  My husband and I just adopted a French bulldog in February and there are so many meetups for dog owners!  Everyone is 20-30 years old too.  It’s a great way to meet people.
After 8 years you have to pay him back. Wow that is so selfish. I am betting once you make that doctor money his money will be his money and your money will be y'alls money.

"She’s not and that’s something I’ve been trying to get her to do. She bought some books recently about personality disorders and I’ve noticed she’s reading them and bookmarking things, but I don’t feel like that’s enough.

This is really the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do and I appreciate you taking time to give some thoughts."
"&gt;her therapist understands why we don't buy her a car.


No he didn't. Not unless he's incompetent.  She's choosing to mis-remember whatever he DID say to suit her purposes. Or just making it up."
"I think you have to just start being direct. For example: if he complains about you watching TV when he has to get things done, Let him know he has the option of going somewhere he won’t be distracted/you can leave (if you’re in his place)

When you mention that you are going to a party and he complains that it will get in the way of things getting done tell him “yeah, You should get those things done. Let me know if you still have time tonight afterwards and you can come with me.” Or “OK, I don’t wanna keep you from getting that stuff done. I’ll go without you and we can do something else soon/you can come next time.”

Directly confront the unspoken assumption that he is going to constantly attend things with you. Make it clear that it is *on him* to decide how he manages his time, not you."
"Probably is true but I think I kind of scared that if I become less avaiable and more pretending people can not like me or love me, on the other hand I think that if my boyfriend is not ""caring"" (maybe too much) like me he is not loving me and he is just using me, the rage comes from the fact that I miss him so much I would never go on vacation without him, but for him is not the same. He is not my heaven, probably I have ti accept this like you said"
"Honestly, there's deffo something between them."
High fives to another Captain Awkward reader!
"&gt;These things cause fights

Things don't cause fights. People do. In this case: *you* do. 

You urgently need to go and get therapy and fix your *very severe insecurity* before it ruins your life and relationship(s). Don't take it out on him - he's an innocent bystander to your issues."
"I know where you're at, I went through this process 2 years ago. It sounds like you're waiting for him to participate in the relationship in a positive way. Go at your own pace processing this (whether thag is stick around or leave) until you've made a firm decision to stay or go and I hope you find positivity in your life during this rough time."
"Rather than asking internet strangers, as your bf. There is nothing wrong in expecting to pay your partner 50%. Otherwise he needs to find a gf who can afford to pay this kind of money."
"hm. when i was with my last boyfriend (now ex), we kinda shared a friend group. we had all met in the same academic program. my ex worked a lot, wanted time to himself to play video games, etc. and since i didn't want to sit around, basically on my own, i invited our friends out a lot. all of them were dudes except one, and she was the biggest homebody of all.

i often:

- went out to bars
- went to (sometimes fancy!) restaurants
- went to movies
- went to concerts
- went on hikes
- went on road-trips
- hung out at someone's place and watched tv
- etc. 

with the guys. 

sometimes in a group and sometimes solo. i'd say that having a boyfriend that was also friends with these guys gave me the freedom to hang out with them alone, because it was obvious that it was NOT a date. nothing inappropriate ever happened. no flirting. no oversharing. we were just friends hanging out. my boyfriend always knew what i was doing and was fine with it (he wasn't a jealous guy). 

idk what you friend's girlfriend's situation is. i was lonely, bored, and missed my brothers. i also fucking adored my boyfriend. there was never any temptation on my part, and if i had ever felt like someone had a different idea, i would have stopped hanging out with them."
Thank you so much &lt;3
"I don't have all the details, but my guess is that she wants to work on her self esteem. When you give 100% to her, like you said, it doesn't help her personal self esteem, but her self esteem when she's with you."
"I know, I’ve had to let go so many people these last few months because they were so bad for me to be around and they were people I’d known for years it’s been hard"
"I feel like OP is calling this ""neurotic rage fits"" because that makes it seem like she has no control over this and that way he can excuse what she does on some level. But he needs to call it what it is and get the hell out."
"I disagree on that a little bit. It’s my understanding that a transgender person has been their gender their whole life. The only thing that’s changed is how they present to the rest of the world. It’s like a gay person being able to come out of the closet: They are the same person you always knew, they are just now able to be honest to everyone else."
"Seriously! She pretty much got told ""hey, remember OP. You're marrying him next Tues."" by her parents when she was 18. If she was raised to be a traditional daughter she would do what her parents told her to do. Maybe she even hoped that they could grow to love each other. Now that she's an independent adult living in a secular society she can admit that she always has and always will see him as a brother she grew up with. OP is taking it very personally that she doesn't have any romantic feelings for him when facts are you can't just force someone to love you like that."
"Update: I left the group chats and closed my accounts and told them I wasn’t feeling mentally well. I don’t want to be a traitor or anything, and it’s true that I’m not feeling well, so it’s for the best I guess. Better late than never, I just can’t feel right in such a warzone."
"Thanks, your comments are very useful.

Just to clarify, next door is a bed and breakfast. She was there for a week. Definitely agree with your advice though."
Why not just stay away from him for good?
"When my wife was in med school and we weren't yet married but had been together long enough to know it was in the cards, I just set up a joint checking account and diverted some of my income into it for these kinds of situations because she obviously couldn't afford the same stuff like travel and nice restaurants that I could. You have to start asking costs in advance and telling him no, you can't afford the same things he can, and it's up to him to either agree to frugal trips that you can afford, or (hopefully) be generous and chip in extra for your part like I did for my wife."
"Sounds good. And I’d just like to say.. good for you for being there for her. Most people would up and leave so fast, and drag their partner through the dirt in the process. It’s nice to see someone who actually cares and is willing to try."
"I am very aware that I am the cause of a lot of arguments, Although that is not what I was saying. Simply seeing if I am the only one who has these thoughts, Thanks tho :)"

"Exactly, and N was sleeping with OP prior... if anything N sounds like shes confused and will probably end up repeating the same cycle... watch how N will change as soon as OP has another female over.... just my opinion."
"FEIW, it might mean more to her to hear you call her by her name right now."
"Let her cut you out, and see what being on her own is really like. Let her know she can pay her own way through college too. Hell, reinvest that 529 money while you're at it. 

Whatever you do, don't buy her a car. Be zen. You have been about everything else. She wants to go, let her go. She will be begging to talk to you inside of a month. Plenty of people can handle leaving home, but the whiny, sheltered types who've had everything given to them don't typically fair well. It would be good for her to live on her own for a while so she can learn to appreciate everything you have her."
I use Snap regularly.. It’s not offensive to save a picture. Just like in the chat you can hold it to save it too. It’s technology. Anyone who thinks it disappears forever is more than native. I’m not near as old as you think.
"&gt; I believe insecurity is feminine.

If this is really how you think, then you are nowhere mature enough to be in a relationship with ANYONE."
Why do you care so much about not dating someone ugly and obese? Didn’t you say YOU were ugly and obese?
I feel like you should do more things to maybe rekindle the romance. It’s easy to get comfortable in a relationship and get bored. If you both want to make an effort to be with one another you should try new things. The distance maybe a huge problem and maybe the lack of mental stimulation.
My ex and I broke up after about 3 years and her coping was sex not with me but others I would say maybe keep the sex going but go to therapy once and a while together
"Just remind yourself that this person has always been female, and only now has been able to be honest and open about it.

You don’t have a guy friend that just one day became a girl friend. You’ve always had a girl friend who for a long time had to act like a guy."
"This is really not about the OP and her perception of the friendship.  You are ignoring the teacher's position.   If her friends are gossiping about their friendship, sooner or later it will get back to the school administration and things will not go well for him.   At the very least, he will get a reprimand about maintaining boundaries with students.  In the worst case, someone could infer much worse motives and his career could be blighted before he actually gets going."
"I absolutely agree. Although sometimes I feel like bringing up things that I am thinking or feeling just causes irritation and arguments, which I try to avoid."
