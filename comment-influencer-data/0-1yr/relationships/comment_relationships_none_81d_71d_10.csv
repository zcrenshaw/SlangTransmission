"I cringed soooo hard reading this. You are 1000% right that this is the reaction your ex-bf wants, and frankly it's upsetting that your friends and family are siding with your abuser and pressuring you to forgive him. I am so sorry. This behavior is gross all around.

&gt;how do I convey to my family and boyfriend that they are not helping? How do I let them know that I value their opinions and I know they care, but they're making it worse?

Be cordial but very, very firm and say this whenever it's brought up:

""I am trying to understand where you are coming from, but frankly I'm appalled by your behavior and pressuring me to speak to him, much less forgive him. My feelings about ExBF and his abhorrent treatment of me are just that: **my** feelings. You have no right to tell me how to feel or who to forgive, and I ask that you respect my decision to keep this toxic abuser out of my life. I wont' be discussing this with you again, I hope it's understood that this topic is closed."""
"If she took it this far, imagine how far she could take it in the future. Speak to your superiors, let them know of the situation and either request she be moved to a different room or that you and the other roommate are. If she didn't do it then you need to find who did."
"Julien Solomita (another YouTuber if you don‚Äôt know) did two vlogs awhile back called ‚Äúsomething scary happened‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come to our house‚Äù. Maybe show her these. Granted, people came to his and his girlfriend‚Äôs (Jenna Marbles) house, but maybe it will convey to her that even a visit from a ‚Äúnice person‚Äù can be very scary because they have no way of knowing whether or not a person is nice. It is almost NEVER welcomed."
This does not sound like a joke to me. Tell your husband. Tell your husband you don't want to be alone with his brother anymore.
"This wasn‚Äôt a single mistake, you repeat the mistake each day you don‚Äôt make decisions to fix it. Stop pretending and start taking care of yourself."
"She's being ridiculous. And your initial message apologizing for such a non-thing prior to her sending the email tells that you are all too familiar with her petty behavior.

Do not validate her misbehavior by apologizing what you did wrong, because you didn't do anything wrong. Give her the space she needs and decide on this friendship on how she behaves next. You might feel sorry for how this made her feel, but in the end that's all on her."
"This isn't a phase. 

I want to posit a different reality that you might not have considered. Rather than this guy being so different in terms of his investment in you and your connection, what if that's not really what's going on. If you think about Dating, capital 'D' dating, as a learning curve, you're right at the point in your life where relationships get more....personal. Your young life dating, high school and your early twenties, are prone to less nuanced matches. You know less about what you're looking for and you're more willing to get with people who aren't maybe the greatest matches in the soul sense of things. Its not uncommon for those early relationships to feel kind of superficial and fly-by-night because they are. One of the things you learn while dating is how to eliminate people who aren't a great fit. With more experience, you'll do a better job zeroing in on men with whom you can form a more nuanced connection with more in common and more positive traits. 

I say all this because it might not so much be him that's so wonderful. It might be that you're at a point where yes, you're making higher quality matches. You were able to find someone whose sense of humor and dedication to you is very strong. There's a lot of good here. By your mid-twenties, that's a skill you should have. But despite that skill, you've still found that there are deal-breakers on the table here. He might be very close to what you'd look for in a long term partner, but he's clearly got a lot of personal growth to do. So what might feel like throwing away an otherwise great guy might be just another step up the ladder in terms of your relationships skills. You're now at a point where those long-term deal breakers like jealousy and insecurity aren't something you can ignore. You want a man that's going to bring the intimacy and the humor without the baggage, which is something to which you are entitled. 

It's just a finer honing of your sense of what you need out of a partner and out of a relationship. It's really, really valuable. 

Relationships like these, despite ending, aren't failures. They are keystone moments by which we develop a sense of what we want out of a romantic relationship and the boundaries we need to articulate to have a happy, loving connection with someone. The lived experience of having dating Mr. Oh-So-Close is what lets you know you're on the right (or wrong) track in the future. It's invaluable experience. I think you've driven this train about as far as its going to go."
"...how many nights to herself does she get a week, OP? 

Not out. Because she is a homebody.

But how many nights a week does she get to be in her house without you or the baby so she can get a break? 

It should be the same, no?"
DONT GET HER PREGNANT.
"&gt; If you feel it's worth it, I'd just tell her ""I saw your blog post"" and leave it at that

i think OP should let her sister know that she saw the blog post (like you said) and also tell her ""i didnt expect this from you"" to express her disappointment 

her sister sees herself as being a good person thats living life the right way, so making her face her shitty behavior will force her to do some reflection"
"Will it really change anything if you know specifically what it was that was thrown? You already have all the information you need.      

* You know he threw something 6 stories down that had enough mass to intentionally injure someone

* You know he's not losing any sleep over injuring a stranger       

* You know he's willing to lie to you

* You know he will shut down issues you think are important

üôÑ Sounds like a real keeper /s"
"Stop cooking for him.

That's it. That's all you have to do.

If he won't stand up for you to his mom, he doesn't deserve your kindness. He can fend for himself."
"That whooshing sound you just heard is the giant bullet you dodged. Imagine what she'll be like planning the wedding.

This is no great loss to you. You may not see it now, while you're still raw and hurting, but this isn't really that bad for you. Stop reaching out, don't try to fix this. Just let her be and enjoy the emotional peace of not having to help her."
"The best comments here said it best, DO NOT just say I want a divorce and let the cards fall where they may. Have a plan. Understand where you will go, how you will afford life, and what support network you have - you will need someone to talk to if you want to recover and be at peace with this ( i.e., don't take the grief &amp; anger with you). Also, once you have your plan tell him you both need this and then stick to the plan regardless of what he says and how it makes you feel (good or bad). It will suck, but long term you need to survive the  bad to achieve the good. Good luck."
"The good thing is you asked. The bad thing is you asked twice in ten minutes. That can really destroy her level of comfort with you.

You can apologize and promise to really listen to her going forward, but I would understand if she didn't want to give you the benefit of the doubt there."
"Sit down, line out all the chores on paper, every single last one, and start drawing straws. 

Tell him if he doesn‚Äôt want to do his 50% he can hire a maid.

Tell him he is not allowed to yell at you again because it‚Äôs extremely disrespectful and you deserve better. 

But mostly, and I rarely say this, ditch that dude. He‚Äôs entitled and treats you like shit and it‚Äôll only get worse."
"Alzheimer's sucks, and I am so sorry.

Your grandpa's apology needs to include him and your dad straightening this out with the rest of the family."
"Start calling him out on it. Hey dont kiss my neck"" as soon as he does it. Dont let it slid or else he will keep pushing your boundaries. He might even think you're into it for some reason. Make him feel embarrassed for doing it."
"Dude, frankly, even having Alex at your wedding without Tina is gonna be rough for Kate. She‚Äôs not going to forget what happened just because Tina‚Äôs not there. There‚Äôs only so much damage control you can do here if you want Matt at your wedding."
"&gt; I don‚Äôt know if he can live on his own. 

You‚Äôd be surprised at what people like him can do when given no choice. He‚Äôll either find a family member or a friend to be his new mommy or he‚Äôll get his shit together enough to feed and shelter himself. He doesn‚Äôt seem like he can do it *now* because he‚Äôs got you. 

Just call a lawyer and tell them you want a divorce. They‚Äôll give you the rundown on what to expect. Figure out who should stay in your current residence. Then tell your husband that you‚Äôre done, and it‚Äôs not negotiable, the ball is already rolling and you‚Äôll be doing [X] with the living situation. Go from there. 

I‚Äôm sorry, OP. It‚Äôs no fun ending a relationship, even when it‚Äôs necessary. I hope it goes relatively smoothly."
"Definitely not a joke, dude is testing his boundaries."
"Oh no. I'm pretty sure I passed a yoga place that Julien works at and thought "" I should go visit and say hey"" but then I realized that would be a totally insand thing to do. So many fans say things like ""that's the price of fame"" like they have an absolute right to their home. Julien, Jenna, Marbles, Kermit, Peach, and Bunny deserves their space"
"This isn't a drunk problem or an embarrassment problem. This is a problem about how she expects and demands affection be performed, and the hurtful tactics she uses to get it. 

You're not being crazy, but pinning this to drinking is not helpful. She using pouting and ""You don't love me"" as ways to coercive what she wants out of you, while sober as well as drunk. It's just sloppier when she drinks, but you're describing the same behaviour. 

Chances are pretty damn good she isn't going to change, and that the problem will build up until it's intolerable for one of you... but you should let her know this is *hurtful*. Not annoying or embarrassing, but *hurtful*. And that it comes across as *manipulative* that she refuses to acknowledge how the behaviour hurts you. Maybe that isn't her intent, but  if every time you do the tiniest thing she doesn't like she jumps to ""You must not love me"" it is really hurtful to be distrusted like that, and it's really limiting, because healthy people should disagree sometimes or want some time apart. 

And it's limiting because it means there are things you don't enjoy together anymore, like drinking with friends, because her actions while drunk *hurt* you. 

She needs to give you more trust and respect. Her current tactics to get what she wants out of you are not working. They are hurting you and harming your relationship in a way that might even make it end.

Here is the thing you have to remember tho: You have a GF who clearly values verbal affirmation. If you want to continue in this relationship, you can't just deny her that, you both need to agree to other ways to offer her some affirmation she's seeking, that doesn't involve her pouting or bullying them out of you. This might actually mean for a while you have to offer more confirmation, even get out of your comfort zone to do that, but it should be words and actions you both agree too, not you being bullied into it."
"Thank you! So far everyone on base has told me to tell our drill sergeants because it‚Äôs better to be safe than sorry. But in my head, I‚Äôm like struggling to believe that she actually went this far. I‚Äôm definitely trying to move out of this room though. I just don‚Äôt know what to say to avoid pointing the finger directly, I guess? Because a small part of me doesn‚Äôt want to believe she was capable of doing this sort of thing."
"Yeah, I was thinking that we are basically family without the legal titles right? Maybe it‚Äôs better for me to ask her alone and also explain that her younger son is worried too. 

His anxiety is an ongoing problem and he‚Äôs only recognised that he needs some therapy very recently. 

Thanks - I think I‚Äôm just going to ask her if I can go over and speak with her."
I think it‚Äôs pretty controlling that she expects you to adapt to her sleeping schedule. It does seem like she expects a lot from you and you just have to think about if all of that is worth it
"You need to be way more direct. ""Stop taking to me when I'm trying to get work done."" ""Stop tapping me to get my attention; it's rude and I'm trying to work."" ""No Jane I didn't hear you because like I said I cannot talk to you all day."" Ignore her. Mute her texts. Is there a boss you can talk to about this?"
"&gt;She says that I wasn't there for her in the way she needed and deserved during her special time of engagement.

Honestly, just reading that made my toes curl. What's she actually expecting, for you to throw your own celebration for her in your own apartment?! This is awful, entitled behaviour. 

Saying you weren't there for her in a time of need like that is what you'd say to someone during a bereavement or something, it's just blatant emotional blackmail and it's not true. You did absolutely nothing wrong.

If this friend is going to hold the way you reacted like this for this particular occasion against you, what is the point? It'll be the same when she calls you up to say she's pregnant, or, whatever other milestone she needs to brag about. Ridiculous behaviour, and you should have no involvement in it."
"I'm sure there are other famous youtubers that have made videos talking about experiencing things like this (fans crossing boundaries), perhaps find one and show her?"
"How can you say she's an 'ok sister' when what you describe is petty and even mean (and what's with your family going along with her laughing at your hobbies?!).

Why do you want her in your life when 'she makes my life devoid of joy and passion'?

You don't have to be close to people just because they are family.

I would just keep your hobbies to yourself since she's never reacted in a positive way to you sharing them with her. If she asks what you're up to, just say 'uni, mostly' hanging with friends' and that's that. If she asks you about any hobby specifically, you can just say 'I don't have as much time for it these days so don't have anything serious going on at the moment'. That should be the end of those conversations.

Also, it's ok to just limit the amount you two are in touch. If she's not adding to your life in any way and actually taking away from it, why bother spending any time on her? You can be polite and friendly if you would see her at family gatherings, but you don't have to spend any time with her one to one (whether that's irl or on the phone etc)."
"Just get a divorce, dude. If you feel guilty she has nothing, just pay her alimony. It's better than let this fester and gradually grow into something terrible."
You are plan B. She will stay with you until another plan A catches her eye. Never be anyone‚Äôs plan B.
"It'll at least be reported so that if something else happens they can see a pattern. If she does something else then that'll ""be the first time""  and they might assume she's harmless which she's not if she's putting house cleaner in your face cleaner."
"The biggest one here being he transferred his GI bill to her, jfc"
God I feel bad for her fiance just reading this
"1) Say _nothing_ to him until you are fully prepared. 

2) Assuming you are going the divorce route, gather and save all needed evidence (videos, pictures, texts, etc.) in an off-site location (preferably multiple locations, with multiple trusted people). 

3) Contact the top divorce lawyers in the area and do a consultation. Do a consultation with each will likely conflict them out of representing him. This may backfire a bit, if he ends up being represented by an idiot, but you also don't want him represented by a hotshot bulldog. 

4) Do a deep dive into your finances. Are there any hidden accounts? Do you have passwords to all of the online accounts? What about your retirement funds? What property do you own? If she's much younger, he may be supporting her in some way (sugar daddy relationship?). Where is that money coming from?

5) Think long and hard about what you're going to tell your kids. Maybe consult some therapists or have some lined up for the eventual fallout. Having the evidence from #2, will keep him from spinning an untrue version of events."
"If his way of resolving conflict is to give you the silent treatment for days, and then yell at you, you have bigger problems than cleaning. Do you really want to spend your life cleaning up after someone with the emotional maturity of a toddler?"
"Your step son is escalating his behaviour towards your young daughters and your husband is in denial because it is his son. I've seen this happen in so many families because a lot of people can't or won't reconcile that their family member is capable of something so horrible.

You need to have a very frank conversation with him about this being your hill to die on. Install locks on the girls' doors."
"Give her time. She might be done with you, or she might decide to give her another shot, only time will tell. An apology showing you understand what you did wrong would not be out of place. And in the future, if someone says ""no"" that means NO for the whole encounter. After someone says ""no"" it's a *huge* turnoff (and kinda gross, and sometimes scary) when someone asks or begs or tries to step over the boundary anyway."
We started having get togethers in our yard and inviting neighbors. We got to know everyone better and built a social network out of it. We now have a regular group who gets together that spans ages from early 20s up to 50s. Our common theme is our neighborhood but we branch out and go surfing and sailing and do other activities.
"Dear god, yes, we've already passed far from any criteria of reasonableness around here.

What it seems to me is that this is a clear case of  where the woman doesn't want (and will never want) to have sex and for some inexplicable reason the partner had the idea that this would magically change from some point on. (Usually after marriage.) 

From your own description, OP, your wife from the beginning was completely against any kind of intimacy or anything closer to a sexual contact. I don't know where you got the idea that this would change for some reason: you chose to marry a person who doesn't want to have sex. I don't understand how now you seem to be surprised at not having sex right now.

You say you ""don't know what to do""... But that's because you really don't have anything to do. I mean, maybe by insisting on couple therapy you can get her to tell you why she doesn't want to have sex, which isn't something that you will get for sure. But after 4 years? 

I think you've passed the point of acceptance. By a lot. You have to accept that you will not have sex with this woman. She obviously doesn't want it, and she never wanted that, which is evident from your own description of the relationship. You're never going to have sex with this woman - what you're going to do about it, it's your decision."
"This is how my grandfather's dementia started. Losing money, thinking he did things when he didn't, forgetting which day of the week it was and insisting he had a doctor's appointment at 2pm because it was Tuesday when really it was Thursday and the appointment wasn't for another month. This definitely needs to be addressed by a medical professional."
"&gt;How do I get him to help me out?

Make it clear to him that doing half of the housework is not ***helping you out;*** it's his responsibility as a person who also lives in the apartment. 

When he was the only one with an income, your contribution to the household was to do all the housework. That made sense. Now that you both are spending time earning money for the household, you both need to be spending time on the housecleaning. 

If he is unwilling to get on board with this, then you might want to reevaluate the relationship. You got a job in the first place because he was *getting angry* about money. Now he is *getting angry* because you are not still doing all the cleaning now that you have  job. The fact that he default to anger instead of discussion when he doesn't like how things are is in itself a huge red flag."

"I have not tried to explicitly make the headphones a silent time for me. Someone else suggested this as well, and I absolutely love the idea. Thanks!"
"&gt; Have a plan.

Part of the plan should be hiring, or at least consulting, a divorce lawyer first to get advice for finalizing your plan.  I don't know if there are things a lawyer will suggest you do before telling your husband or not, but it makes sense to consult sooner than later in the process."
"Just don't go to the event you have tickets for, that would be better then going along with someone that doesnt want to be with you"

"&gt; I have not talked with my ex in over 7 years [ only via the Book of Faces ] and have seen her face to face in over a decade

&gt; She says that she doesn't want to stir up trouble for me.

I mean, this is classic overthinking. Nothing in your post indicates there will be trouble and it's been a decade. You can't deal with something that isn't happening. Be professional and courteous then see what happens."
"His wife needs to protect herself financially and legally from his poor decisions. She needs that divorce. ASAP.

There is probably nothing else to be done here for him: The other people around him need to make sure they are safe *from him*. 

Keep trying to point out the irrationality of this for as long as you can, but don't expect this story to have a happy ending."
"Stop trying to do activities to meet friends. Find things you're passionate about in earnest and so them for the enjoyment of it, and the friends become more likely because they'll be like-minded people.

"I read something recently that *might* help:

""Your actions are speaking so loudly I can't hear your intentions"".

"Yeah, either you tell him or have your husband tell him to eff-off with this."
"I'm going to address the boyfriend down below. However, I want to say this first because it's super important about the roaches:

I once worked for a company that brought up apartments and houses that were total shitholes and got them into better shape so that they would pull more money for rent. Roaches are something that I have dealt with on a level that I can't even describe to you without making some readers want to vomit. I have seen some shit with roaches that would be hard to believe.

I say that to say this: Harris Roach Tablets are less than $10 (Amazon, Walmart, etc. have them), and they work like waging absolute fucking genocide on some roaches. Forget the sprays, forget the bait trap bullshit and all of that other shit that doesn't work. If you want to kill a shitload of roaches, then get you some of those tablets. Put a few under each sink, under the fridge, in the backs of cabinets, etc. There will be so many goddamn dead roaches that it should be considered a hate crime.

With that said...

Roaches don't happen because you didn't keep the place perfect. Roaches happen because they are absolutely incredible as a species and can live off damn near anything. If you leave shit out for them to eat, it can make it worse, but if you came into a situation that already had them, then it doesn't matter how clean you keep shit because they're just going to hang around.

My point in this is that the roaches are not your fault.

So here's what you do. Genocide the roaches with those tablets I mentioned above, and if you don't have somewhere you could move to (parents, etc.) if you broke up, then get yourself to a situation where you could live on your own if you needed to. Those are the two most important things at the moment.

As for the guy, you already know he's a dipshit, and my recommendation would be to leave him simply because of how he's treated you over this, but you probably already knew that."
This is not a joke.  This is wildly inappropriate and should've been nipped in the bud a long time ago.  You need to tell your husband and not be alone with his brother.
"My Fiance did not have my mom there, nor would I have wanted my mom there."
"Yeah, watching this dude do this would make me seriously examine how he treats me as his friend and I'd be asking myself if I want such a sneaky manipulative liar in my life. Hint: I'm strongly leaning toward FUCK NO. üëé"
"This is kind of manipulative (use your powers for good only!) but you could redirect them to help your female coworker. Like, when they come over to your desk, put on a big friendly aw-bless-your-heart smile and say ""Oh yes, Ms. Coworker and I need you to [insert whatever she needs them to do], thank you sooooo much!"" If you really want to rub it in, wait until whoever helped Ms. Coworker last is in front of other men and say something like ""Hey, thank you sooooo much for helping Ms. Coworker and me just now"", big cheesy pageant-winner smile, and cut. This kind of guy is awful but also usually stupid and easily conditioned. 

When you hear coworker men tearing down Ms. Coworker, say ""I don't appreciate that remark, she actually works really hard,"" and do a stone face. (When you hear your supervisors degrade her, note down what they said along with the date and time, somewhere the company does not have access to.)

Basically, you can consciously divide the sexist men into the ones who care more about trying to get your favor and the ones that are committed to trashing your female coworker, and then set them against each other. Make friends in HR if you can.

Also talk to the lady, she's probably as isolated and grossed out by the sexism there as you. Be a team. Seek out and befriend any other women working there. I'm willing to bet your male coworkers are racist and homophobic and transphobic and such too, so listen out for that and befriend the targets.

Have you ever watched Aggretsuko on Netflix? It's about a young woman dealing with office work, particularly sexism. There's a character called Tsunoda who is an expert at the kind of tactic I'm recommending here."

2.	Who would be taking care of the animals and plants if your boyfriend wasn't available?

Girl I stopped reading after number 1. That is enough to have broken up day one.
"Ask him this question, ""What is holding us back from marriage right now? If we had the opportunity tonight, what would hold us back?"" and then wait out the pregnant pause. It's important that you don't try to fill the silence with your own words while he sorts out what he is thinking or wants to say. Wait silently and patiently, even if it takes 10 or 15 minutes, and let him come up with a real answer for you. If he doesn't want to answer, then ask ""What thoughts crossed your mind when I asked you that question?"" It's impossible to tell what he's thinking. He could have lost interest in marriage after being with other partners. Maybe he thinks that's something you will want to take back. Most married people are not comfortable with their partner sharing affection for other people, even in previously polygamous relationships. Maybe he is concerned about financial instability, doesn't want children, or really just is getting cold feet about the permanence of a marriage. It could be absolutely anything and direct questioning is really the only way to find out."
"Remember, he could be just as petty and superficial as she is, in which case I fear for their theoretical future children."
"So... What you're saying is that you're dating a complete tool and an asshole. 

&gt;he isn't selfish

He most certainly is:

&gt;he even admits that he did it just to get what he wants

But to the point:

&gt;Do narcissists change over time?

Nope. Pretty much never. Especially when they keep getting rewarded by being one (example: you're still there)."
Are you sure that you and this girl are that compatible? You shouldn't be dating someone who stresses you out.
"&gt;  ‚Äústop getting in my face or I‚Äôm going to hit you‚Äù

I would take this deadly seriously. People don't say this for no reason.

Yes, he is abusing you. The whole ""when things are good they're really good"" is classic for abuse. If he was horrible to you all the time, you'd leave, right? Being nice half the time is how he keeps you just confused enough to stay.

Do not marry him. Abuse often escalates after a commitment and he's already been physical with you. I would speak to a lawyer and start working on a plan to get out safely. DO NOT tell him you're leaving. That's the most dangerous time to be around an abuser. Get your ducks in a row, find anyone you trust to help you move out, and get your stuff out of the house while he's at work. Leave the papers where he can see them.

There's a reason he went after a teenager, because he wanted to take advantage of your lack of experience. Now your eyes are open. Please stay safe."
"Maybe she could message to ask him whether he'd be happy to meet to accept a gift from a fan who happens to live in the same town. He might offer a public place, or he might tell her no, in which case she will have to stop pretending it's appreciated. I can't imagine his employer being pleased if fans turn up to distract him at work, so even if she thinks he would like the gift, she should understand that receiving it at work could get him into trouble."
I'm not sure why you think someone who incessantly talks shit about you and has already been seen rifling through your belongings wouldn't also tamper with something of yours. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...

You need some help on boundaries. 

It would have been fine to say, ""I am sorry, I can't attend the dinner.""  and if asked why to say, ""I am not in a place where I can bring something.""  

I have never heard of a mandatory sponsor potluck in my 30+ years of sobriety.

No is a complete sentence.

FYI-you don't have to dramatically drop a sponsor, you can simply find someone else.

I am guessing that you might have some challenges with interpersonal relationships that may be beyond the scope of NA or AA.

My suggestion to to ask some people who have been clean for more than a year to help you find an appropriate sponsor because I think you need some help picking. Which is TOTALLY normal.

I have had a professional counselor AND a sponsor for more of the last 30 years than not.  

Finally...I would be so hurt if I were in your shoes and it would be a situation ripe for resentment.  That is why I woukd need to talk it over with an appropriate person, find my part in it (just MY part not taking on all of it), make amends if needed and then pray for her for a while.  Because I would be pissed.  And that isn't a safe situation for me.  I list those things because that is the process I have learned to use to work through anger and resentment."
I think she tried to help her gf and say something like that so they have a communication base.
"That's really freaking weird and I think that would crush anyones self esteem. This would honestly be a deal breaker for me, because I know it would always be in the back of my head. I am definitely down with my boyfriend masturbating to whatever he wants, but I don't want to know about it and if I found out it was someone close to me it would ruin our relationship."
"Been there.

I suggest therapy and a divorce support group like DivorceCare or New Beginnings.  Mainly because I needed a specific time to grieve so it didn't take over my life.

There is more going on in this marriage than one night of cheating.   

This (being cheated on) was genuinely the most painful thing I have ever been through.  

Not everyone is a cheater. There are men who are horrified by extramarital affairs and are monogamous.

You can be happy again.

Spoiler alert:  You may (probably) will find out that there are things you could have done better in the marriage too.  Own them. But it is no excuse for cheating.

Also, he sounds like he might be a binge type alcoholic..If so, Alanon may be helpful for you even if you do divorce him."
"lol, fucking half of an engaged couple and destroying their relationship is an interesting way to try and gain acceptance in a group. Fuck Tina, tbh. If Alex wants a friend group who embraces his affair partner, he should look elsewhere. That's just a fact of life when you cheat on someone in your friends circle.

Alex made this drama to start with, and now he's keeping it going. I would all fiancee to tell him, one time, hey dude, you know it means a lot to me to have you at my wedding. You also know we can't have Tina there, it's a non starter. It would really hurt my feelings is you choose not to come, but it's your choice to make. Please let us know by (date) if you'd like to come."
"It's easier to break up with a mama's boy than divorce a mama's boy, and both are easier than changing a mama's boy.

"I knew early on that getting married was a huge mistake. We are not compatible. I was embarrassed to tell family and friends I fucked up so I stayed. I had kids. So I stayed. 22 years later I've realized that I've lost my 30's and 40's to pretending to be happy when I could have actually been happy. Even alone I would have been happier.  I cannot get those years back.  Now I'm old, broke, lonely and still married. Do not be me!! Get out now!!"
"You‚Äôve only been together for three months. Before you uproot your whole life for this person, get through the honeymoon phase. I‚Äôd do long-distance for *at least* a few months while you two continue to get to know each other."
"No, *she* would have ended her own career. Want to stay employed? Don't fucking create a risk of physical harm to others."
The only reason he's with someone as young as you is because women his own age won't put up with this bullsh!t
"Tell her to imagine if it were you, and some 56 year old woman was after you the same way. Would she feel comfortable?"

Or just go file. He‚Äôll figure it out when he gets served."
"Seriously, time of need? Unless her parents are selling her to a wicked Duke this is not a ‚Äútime of need‚Äù and the implication that you owe her something is wild. It‚Äôs manipulation.

"For real, that was his ticket to a better life. Now she‚Äôs getting a free education while he endures morning PT forever"
Have you told her this?
"You say this person has a ‚Äòhistory of cutting people off‚Äô.... you‚Äôre probably in the line of fire because you‚Äôre one of the only people left willing to put up with her drama.

I would simply respond: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm truly baffled you feel that way and will not put up with being spoken to in a disrespectful, patronizing manner. However, I do still wish you and your fianc√© a happy future. Best of luck with the wedding planning.‚Äù 

From there, she can either genuinely apologize / try to repair things (highly doubtful), ignore you (which will confirm she was willing to go nuclear on you for no fucking reason), or keep spewing nonsense (which will also confirm that she‚Äôs a terrible person and you can just ignore/block her).

PS: I got married recently and firmly believe no one is ‚Äúobligated‚Äù to explicitly express lots of enthusiasm about anyone‚Äôs engagement. That obligation belongs solely to the person you‚Äôre marrying."
That‚Äôs not the right way to word it. His concerns are totally valid but you make it sound like a bf is all she needs and her own hobbies/insecurities don‚Äôt matter.
"Give it up. You guys are 17 and she's not coming back. She wanted an excuse to talk to some other guy without feeling like she was cheating. And the think about a ""break"" especially in this case is that she is using you as back up. She's saying, ""if I decide I don't like this other guy better than you then I guess I'll take you back."" It's also really selfish to make you wait like that. She's not coming back and if she trys you really should not take her back."
Bail before kids. Divorce after kids is a vagillion times harder.
"9 PM bedtime. Wtf. That's controlling as hell. I've had bfs in the past that insisted that we go to bed at the same time. Which I get that is a normal couple thing, but 9 PM. You're not in the 2nd grade. Tbh, I would have broken up over that. 

Ok, besides that. It looks like you spend more than enough time together. Pretty much every evening and most of your days off. She just wants you to go to bed at 9 on Fridays, too. Even when I was a little kid, I got to stay up late on Fridays. 

People in relationships still need alone time, and it doesn't appear like she wants you to ever be alone with yourself. Maybe you need to set some bounderies, explain to her why you need this, and as a compromise (cause that's what couples do) you could stay up until 10, or gasp 11pm, and gain a couple of hours per day together. 

Sorry, I can't get over the 9PM bedtime. Why would you agree to that. I get going to bed at the same time, but in the summer it's still daylight out."
"**definitely not overreacting.** sounds like he's gaslighting you. plus, he's been hiding shit since the beginning. not a healthy start. &amp; you're always gonna have doubts about this chick. PLUS, he didn't side with you when she put in fake complaints about you? that's borderline sociopathic."
"Yes! Better to be safe than sorry. Thank you! 
I honestly have always thought she was a tad bit off the wall. Just the way she acts when men decide not to pursue a relationship with her and how she treats other people. I definitely don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs harmless, no matter how much she pretends to be."
"I agree with this.  The brother texted the fianc√© in a poorly thought out attempt to stick up for his sister.  He was totally influenced by mom.  

OP should take some time to talk it over with him, calmly.  Maybe thank him for what he felt was having her back, but explaining that before making decisions like that he needs to hear both sides of the story.  If he had talked to sis about it first, he might have agreed with her rather than with mom. 

So we have a manipulative mother ranting at her teen son who doesn‚Äôt have the maturity yet to recognize and deal with manipulation.  This can prove to be a learning experience for the brother, and sis has the opportunity to be the one to teach him."
Thanks for your response. I am not sure how to view it from another perspective right now. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"The other posts that make me sad are the ""do I have the right to ask my boyfriend for (insert basic human consideration here) or would that be controlling?"" posts."
"I also think her controlling behavior, and her desire that he spend all this time with her, is coming from a place of insecurity. She'd probably benefit from some therapy"
"I think this is a good opportunity to examine why you would even say such cruel things in the first place, especially about someone who was nothing but lovely to you on your date. I get being frustrated and cynical with dating, I've been there many times myself, but I can't imagine making such nasty, superficial comments about anyone even if I didn't have a good time with them. You are almost 30 years old and that kind of thing should have been left in junior high.

As for your boyfriend, you need to let him be and if he decides he can forgive you, he may reach out. However, after two months, anyone who has any self-worth will likely be gone."
The video is titled ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come to our house‚Äù
"&gt; ""there's nothing to discuss. This is your issue""

&amp;#x200B;

This says it all. She believes there is nothing to discuss and nothing to change. She's clearly fine with living like this, so you have to decide if you want to live like this for the rest of your life or not."
"I would bet my ass they know. And have heard things. No way dad is getting plowed with a dildo down the hall without some noise. They probably don't know what the fuck to do.

Chalk it up to a learning experience for your future dates.
"The mother of a friend at highschool told her daughter (my friend) she was sick, but didn't tell her younger son. My friend felt a horrible burden not being able to talk to her brother about it, at the request of her parents, and of course her brother felt awful when he eventually found out. Which of course he did because people always guess like you've done.

Have a chat with your MIL (she is, even if it's not legal yet) on your own and ask. Tell her you're all worrying and it might be better if she just told everyone that's what's going on if it is. You could all be wrong, of course, but she's feeding it by saying cryptic things."
"You are doing what's right, dont let him into your life again. 

He made his bed a d now he has to lay in it. Hopefully he will realized the bed isnt to comfortable and change, but he needs to fix this himself. 

Stay safe and stay away from him."
"Im in the same boat, as far as my engagement. My dad is super pissed that he didn't ask him, so the whole wedding process with his involvement has been painful. 

I explained to my dad that I've always told him not too. It's old fashioned and it's not up to him to ask my dad. 

It took threatening him with not being able to come to get him to drop it. Hes still not involved as much as he should be as a father, but this day is about me and my fiance. Not him. 

Your fiance explaining may not fix things, but if she thinks she can help bridge the gap, have her say something"
Don‚Äôt let this go. That is fucked up and he‚Äôs lying.
I could not have said it better. Just because a person is drunk doesnt mean they dont know what they are doing.
"He is definitely getting catfished and/or taken for a ride.

He and his wife obviously need to get divorced and you guys need to have an intervention about this insane plan of his. Unfortunately, there's only so much you can do if he's hell-bent on doing this. Sounds like he's completely bought into this and I think he may have to get badly burned in order to realize this is a fantasy."
"Look dude. You're not compatible.

You don't just get stressed ""hearing about it."" You go out looking for it. You want to know. Then you argue with her about it knowing it will go nowhere. You're causing your own drama.

This is who she is. She obviously has no intention of changing. You don't get to tell her who she should be. She's grown and she decided that for herself.

If you wanna ""draw a line,"" then it needs to be to remove yourself from the situation and date someone else, because that's the only thing you can do."
... Then it probably floats and therefore is a witch.
"I know you're young and you probably won't take this advice, but you're gonna wish you did 10 years from now, looking back on this (currently) shitty relationship. 

You have all the power here. He does his 50% or you can leave. And clean your own place all on your own. I know living situations are hard to change suddenly, but I moved into my car rather than live with someone who told me to go do the dishes after coercing me into having sex with him even though I was feeling depressed. 

I'm sure you love him, but he isn't doing a very good job of loving you. 

I swear you deserve it."
"She's going to ask for a ""break"" before she goes on her trip, so that she can have fun with this guy, and then resume your relationship when she gets back.

I'd just tell her you know she's been lying about hiding contact with another man from your, break up with her, and tell her to have fun seeing her guy in Thailand."
Why do you visit them?
"He already knows he should. Every person knows they need to clean. He just doesn't care or want to. He's a lazy, misogynistic asshole."
"I did. She thinks that because she doesn't have any bad intent for this meeting and she's even bringing a gift, it's totally okay and I'm overreacting."
"Objectively. If they ask you directly about suspicions, then you speak your opinion. And everyone wonders why every E-2/3 marries a stripper to get out of the barracks/berthing..."
"Yep, lawyer. You can‚Äôt save this. And for better or worse I suspect the woman was a professional, while it does happen, not too many 20-somethings are hot for 40-something dads."
"She or someone else tried to incapacitate you and give you chemical burns. That‚Äôs a big deal, especially in the military, because they were attempting to injure a fellow soldier. Ask your drill sergeant to be moved."
"I ended a marriage after 16 years together. Same as you, a few major issues and lots of small ones. When I decided to end it, he guilted me for not wanting to try marriage counseling. But I knew I was done and going to counseling would only be me delaying the inevitable and giving him false hope. That was 5 years ago and I have zero doubt I made the right decision. Do whatever you need to do to live your life in a way that brings you happiness."
"Yeah, when a grown ass man says ‚Äúbed time is 9pm‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be in bed by midnight‚Äù (on a freaking FRIDAY NIGHT no less) I‚Äôd say there are some major red flags in the relationship. I can‚Äôt even imagine trying to dictate when someone else over the age of like 12 goes to bed."
Leave her. She can move back to her friends. You're wasting what should be happy time on her.
"This can be modified at any time. He can change her eligibility from 36 months to 0 on milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil under ""Transfer of Education Benefits"". If she  has used any months, those are spent permanently."
"And don't let him be alone with your daughters (if you have/will have any) If he does't respect adult boundaries, he sure as shit won't respect the boundaries of someone more vulnerable than you.
Speaking from experience."
"This reminds me of that catfish episode where that guy was convinced he was dating Katy Perry, and even after he met the person that was catfishing him, he still believed he was dating Katy Perry."
"Let me be the first of probably many, to say that you should prolly just walk away from this one, OP. The title here pretty much speaks for itself, muchacho."
enough people have shared it that it's made it's way outside his close friends' facebooks.
"This is so awesome. I just broke it off, a mutual break off, with my (ex)bf of 6 months a few days ago. We got along great but there were some reasons it wouldn‚Äôt work out in the long term. This advice makes me feel very solid in the decision to break up. It sucks that it happened and I‚Äôm still sad but it was for the best."
"Yes, I think that is perfectly fine. They advertised the service so those that knew her and appreciated her can say goodbye."
"SERIOUSLY FUCKING DON'T MAN. FUCKING DON'T.

And if she comes to you after you admit you want a divorce, saying she is pregnant, let her know you want a paternity test, so no matter what she knows you are serious about leaving her whether shes truly pregnant or not."
"If you lose her over this, well, I can't really understand why she would drop you because of this.  But if you lose *him* over this, congratulations, it saves you the trouble of having to kick him to the curb yourself."
"If there was a lot of boys before you, who slept with her and then left, I'm guessing your girlfriend didn't have the greatest self-esteem to start with and did it for validation. I'm also guessing that the feeling she was left with was ""the reality of me is not enough"". Even though one night stands work like that and it wasn't about her.

I'm also guessing that her parents did not make her feel confident either. What she does now, the hours of photoshop seems like anxiety mixed with self-esteem issues.

I'd encourage her to find new hobbies to build her sense of self. But also to talk to a therapist, perhaps at the college councelling service."
"See a lawyer. Child support and alimony are a thing. The two months will be hard, but if it‚Äôs what you have to do, you sleep in different rooms,  find ways to avoid the house."
"dang, this sounds like it honestly could be my stepsister who I think is in AIT currently in Texas lol, different initial though.

anyway -- report it. even if she doesn't have plans to do anything else in the future, this is petty and dangerous and she shouldn't be trusted in the field because she's clearly insecure and will do anything to get a leg up on someone else."
"I once saw my favourite singer walking with grocery backs, to my shame I followed him in hope to get autograph. I followed him 2 blocks when I realised how insanely creepy I was stalking behind him, too afraid to talk with him just shadowing his steps. I was 15-years old, so that will be my defence, but still makes me cringe when I think about that."
"If you drink, find a local brewery or bar that you like the atmosphere of. Go once a week, tip well, and strike up occasional conversations with the regulars. My husband and I have met a lot of folks this way over the past decade or so, and a handful of those have progressed into solid friendships.

Making friends as an adult is a numbers game. You may have to meet dozens of people to find one you click with, so it's important to keep trying new activities that'll bring you into contact with folks you haven't met. But on the plus side, it may only take one person to like you enough to bring you into their existing social circle.

And I'm a little hesitant to mention this because it may sound a little harsh (especially if it doesn't apply here), but it wouldn't be the worst idea to put some thought into what vibe you're putting off to others, either singularly or as a couple. Your situation sounds really frustrating, but you also sound like you're holding some resentment towards your current friends, which is something that both those friends and the newer people in your life may be picking up on.

My husband and I have a solid group of friends but we're always happy to meet new people. Our biggest red flags for not continuing a potential friendship are people who seem a little too eager or people who don't have good relationships with other friends. We once went to dinner with a new acquaintance who spent half the time talking about how so many of her friends were always busy and had let her down, and after that, we stopped being available to hang out with her, too. I'd like to think that someone your age would have better social skills, but then again, this woman was nearly forty. If you feel like you've been trying all the standard advice for a long time with no results, you may need to reevaluate if the two of you are presenting yourselves as people that strangers would be eager to get to know. Or maybe even if you're treating the people in your life as actual friends rather than social outlets."
Yeah you really can't take that back. It's over. Move on.
"I'm single, but also realized recently my friendship circle has dwindled.  I realized I haven't been putting enough effort into existing or old friendships and have set a goal of connecting with at least 1 different friend every week, even if it's just a 10 minute phone call while my friend is driving the kids to soccer practice.  It's resulted in more social time, even if that social time revolves around their kids' schedule.  It doesn't bug me to know I'm not a number 1 priority as long as I'm treated with respect and love."
"She may have a medical problem.  My husband was ""damp"" as well.   We doubled a sheet between us as we spooned.  It worked for us,  and the cuddling was great. The bed being damp isn't normal."
"Dude. You are not overreacting AT ALL. I am so sorry for your loss. 
Do you know why men who are that age date women who are 16? Because women their own age know better than to put up with this psycho controlling bullshit. I‚Äôm not saying that to make you feel bad, I‚Äôm saying it to give you a wake up call that this is so far from normal and loving that it‚Äôs not even funny. You may read this and say to yourself ‚Äúwell he has a lot of good qualities too‚Äù but I promise you that none of those outweigh his bad. This is horrible and you need to get away from him. I promise you that you will be so much better off."
"Keep your complaint matter of fact.  Focus on the evidence and don‚Äôt point the finger unless asked.  Remain professional; don‚Äôt be dramatic.

‚ÄúMy acne treatment was tampered with on X June.  The color, fragrance, and texture has changed.  Based on what‚Äôs available in my barrack, I strongly feel this Pine Sol has been added.  I‚Äôd like to make a formal complaint.‚Äù"
"It's one of those things where he's going to say "" I'm just kidding"" until you say ""yes"" (not saying that you will)."
"Sounds typical. Get more interesting friends, tbh.

&gt; Do I tell them politely somehow that hanging out with them is like watching goddamn Air Bud 2 for the 500th time? 

This is gold."
"You also tried to be sly in mentioning that you invited another guy over who was obviously close enough to you to touch you physically but still somehow  was unaware of who your boyfriend is. It seems you are ommitting something and expecting validation that you are innocent even though you orchestrated this entire situation. You seem to talk about him as if he's a kid, saying that he was likely ""sulking in the familiar places"" when in his eyes you betrayed his trust in the worst possible way. To me this says you dont understand the consequences of what happened or you just dont care and it seems to be more likely the latter."
Yep tell the wife. Also he should be on oxygen. It will make a wild of diffence with confusion and temperament.
"I think the husband has told the brother to eff off. However, if she hasn't said anything...the younger brother might feel like she is secretly interested and not take his brother seriously when he says stop."
" She sounds completely self involved and just wow.

I know you're hurting and I'm sorry.

 You can respond, I'm sorry you feel that way, let me know if you change your mind. 

 And that's it.

You didn't do anything wrong and she sounds totally immature and toxic, especially for her age.  
You don't need a friend like that."
"Do not do this.

People in those positions are weary of those from their past who try to rekindle a relationship after fame.

Your boy friend is obsessive, selfish, and delusional.

He‚Äôs 25?!

Ew."
"This is a really lovely idea and also- it really hones in on something that i think a lot of people could really benefit from (but its hard to do) which is, to be friends with people who are not your age.  Some of the most beautiful friendships are between people who can learn from each other."
"It's not a permanent thing, it's his GI bill, he can cancel the whole transfer."
"I know it‚Äôs not the point, but that billboard business is some pretty hilarious badassery."
"First thing I want to tell you is happy birthday. I‚Äôm so so sorry it didn‚Äôt turn out well for you. I think if he cared about you enough he would show you it on your birthday at the very least. You are special. Never forget that. 21st bdays are always full of change for everyone. Some people experience new things, others like yourself, go through incidents that happened today. Maybe this is what it took to be rid of this toxic individual. You are better off without him. You did the right thing. He didn‚Äôt want to spend anything on you, which shows what a real bastard he is. 

And I know you feel alone, and sad, and depressed. But please know that what happened today was not your fault. Please, know that there will always be people in your life who love and care about you. You deserve to be happy."
You're right. I will tell her. Probably she will forgive him and I will lose them both. But I will be able to sleep peacefully.
"I agree! Trust the guy that spends his day smelling vagina. Of all the people in the world, his advice matters. If your Gyn says you're good, then chalk this up to ""asshole"" syndrome on the ex -he was probably trying to avoid going downtown like a selfish a-hole...blaming you. I hope this new guy treats you like a princess."
I very rarely  comment but felt a very strong  need to on this. I am so sorry for the loss of your mother and cannot imagine losing a significant other in the midst of grieving the loss of a parent. This breakup however seems 100 percent the right thing to do and you will be so much better off without clinging to an unequal and unhappy relationship. Just sending you loads of hugs and support from a random internet stranger!
"&gt;Now I don't know if I should tell the wife. He saw me after a while (I couldn't not stare and he ended up noticing) he sent me a texto later asking me not to tell her that the wife doesn't have to know and that he loves his wife but can't be faithful because he loves to be with different women so as long as the wife doesn't know she won't suffer since she loves him so much and would probably end up forgiving.

You tell her and show her this text message.

Also, stop being friends with that piece of shit."
"Don‚Äôt threaten, just divorce him and be done"
"Unless there's more evidence, just go with the nannycam for now. If you catch her doing some shady shit on the nannycam, only then do something about it."
"Honestly, the weirdest thing here is that he told you. Having a separate account for NSFW filtering is pretty common accepts platforms. This isn't creepier than any other porn usage."
"&gt; I don‚Äôt think she does it on purpose though, she has high anxiety

As someone with a clinical anxiety disorder, I want to highlight this and ask you to consider the difference between someone doing something not on purpose and doing something that is genuinely outside their control. Anxiety means sometimes it's hard not to be kind of clingy and irrational; it absolutely doesn't mean it's impossible to respect your partner's boundaries or care about their feelings. 

She might not be choosing to feel anxious and insecure, but she *is* choosing to react to that feeling by acting in a hurtful and controlling manner toward someone she claims to love. That's not okay, actually."
The ease with which he asked for divorce over 2 very common and solve problems is concerning.
"It's one thing to show support, but going up to Every Single One is a lot. Why not choose a few that you can make it to and be busy the rest of the time?"
"When I was in high school, I went through this same thing, and I felt so bad for breaking up with him I was literally crying as I did it. He said something that's always stuck with me.

""Just because I'm a good guy doesn't mean I'm the right one for you.""

It's ok for you to just not be that into her. You aren't obligated to stay with anyone who's nice to you. Someone being nice to you is the bare minimum to date in the first place!

Take my very sweet high school ex's advice."
"Committing fraud automatically disqualifies him from being ""good with money""."
"&gt;the fact we weren't married yet, and if we were married I'd have no right

You bet spending $10,000 in 6 months on non-emergency items would be an issue and any spouse would have a right to say WTF."
"Let stupid be stupid, leave her be. In times like this you'll know who're your true friends are.. your BFF is being fucking dlusional and being manipulated, same with Ken."
It‚Äôs normal to want to hang out with your best friend without their boyfriend/girlfriend. Does he need to go with you every time? Why can‚Äôt he be alone for a little while?
"Have you had a real, heart-to-heart talk with him about his behavior, how he is being perceived by others, and the fact that you are embarrassed by the things he says and the way he behaves? It's possible he doesn't realize it, and a long, honest conversation would be the first step."
"I‚Äôm gonna be honest and say if this happened to me, And I was in his shoes, I would never get over it. No matter what I would always think about what else you might be saying behind my back or what else you don‚Äôt like about me. I personally don‚Äôt think something like this is forgivable and I think you should just move on. Apologize and if he wants to get back with you, it‚Äôs up to him. There‚Äôs nothing you can do now but move on. For future, just remember to delete your messages"
"Exactly!  Its completely unfair to ban your younger brother for mimicking your mom's obvious viewpoint, but allowing her to attend since she is supporting you financially in ways you are obviously unable to do yourself sends a real mixed message.   A pretty hypocritical one."
I like this idea. I'll have to take a look and see if I can find some when it's not 1 a.m. Thanks for the tip!
"Thank you! Honestly I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do. I have both bottles still. Do you think I should directly say ‚ÄúI know it was her,‚Äù or should I present the situation objectively to the NCOs?"
"Studies have shown that men get laid a *lot* more often if they contribute more around the house.

If he somehow, for some reason, just cannot bring himself to make believe he's an actual adult and try to seduce his own wife now then, perhaps he could try picking up more of the childcare and household tasks in the evenings so you're less tired.

That, or you need to have a long talk about *why*, exactly, he's so weirdly passive-aggressive about this. Because it's weird. And passive-aggressive."
"I‚Äôll just lay it out cause it‚Äôs hard to have tact with this issue. People have the ability to smell desperation, and it tends to drive others away more than almost anything else. You need to just talk to people more casually and things should naturally come together. If you message someone and they don‚Äôt respond then just leave it be.

I would get interested in other things instead of worrying about this issue so much. Find some hobbies and activities you enjoy and see if you can naturally meet people that way instead. I would just look to meet new people who share your interests and see where things go."
You could also find PDFs for free/cheaper than a physical copy and send an email blast :) your family sucks for this and they're playing right into your ex's hand. He only wrote the post to manipulate you into talking to him and mess up your life. He hasn't changed and continues to be a garbage human. I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. Their opinions on if you forgive your ABUSER shouldn't even be up for discussion or acknowledged.
"I don't think she communicating very politely but her over all ask is not wrong. She's friends with you, not him. Some of my friends are cool hanging with me and my husband, some prefer one on one time with me. Heck sometimes I prefer one on one time with them. 

If she really is your best friend, I wouldn't throw it way of her preferring to just hang with you. Especially if you spend time with your bf with your family and other friends too."
"You are NOT stupid. Abuse messes with your head and makes it hard to know what's normal. There's a reason it's so hard for people to get out of abuse situations. Don't beat yourself up. He threatened you, and here you are asking for advice because you can tell something is wrong. Be proud of yourself for that!"
"People often mistake extreme possessiveness and jealously as ""he/she just really cares about me and loves me"". That's not love. It's all about control for them. People like that don't change either. It's only going to get worse. This might sound like an exaggeration OP, but this is exactly how Dateline episodes start. You reeeeeally have to be careful with these kinds of people. They are often dangerous and quick to anger which puts you in a very dangerous situation. 

My advice is to get out sooner rather than later. Red flags all over the place. Seriously, it's not going to get any better. And the more you put it off, the worse the breakup will be."
"He‚Äôs an abuser. This is how my boyfriend was too. Shit escalated. Oh, and after we moved in together, this behavior of ‚Äúits mine, not yours!‚Äù didn‚Äôt stop. When he got mad at me, he would lock me out of our SHARED APARTMENT. several nights I had to sleep downstairs by the pool of our apartment on a sun chair. On the nights he WOULD ‚Äúallow‚Äù me to sleep inside despite the arguing, he would make me sleep on the couch, because he said it was HIS BED and not mine, and he didn‚Äôt want to be near me. He turned into a fucking asshole. Your boyfriend is abusing you. Look up ‚Äúlist of things abusers do‚Äù, your boyfriend is doing almost everything on that list. If you for some reason actually do want to work things out with him, then you need to STAND YOUR GROUND and show him that you‚Äôre not some stupid bitch that can be pushed around. However I recommend just leaving the asshole. It doesn‚Äôt get better from here."
"Leave this guy, it will only get worse"
Get out now. Your husband is abusing you terribly. Do not let your kids grow up thinking this is normal. If you subject them to this you are abusing them by staying.
"There are several red flags here that are characteristic of an abusive relationship:  

- the controlling nature (cant have guy friends, cant go out with your friends), the jealousy. This will escalate and he will isolate you from people, friends, and family with enough time

- the walking on eggshells.  

- the super intense love/passion for good times constantly cycles between the negative controlling aspects. This is called Love Bombing, where the goal is to get you addicted to the highs while the abuse and isolation escalates (controlling, emotion abuse, verbal abuse, then finally physical once you are good and separated from your support system)

I know it's never easy, but you need to drop this guy. It's not a phase, he is building you up to accept an abusive relationship. 

Google loveisrespect.  There is a quiz there to see if you are in the makings of an abusive relationship. Unfortunately what you describe is textbook abuse building up. Read around, and if you are more curious,  look at the book ""why does he do that?"" By Lundy Bancroft.


I'm glad posted this, and are aware of these things are not healthy or normal.   It's easier to end it.  When you do break up, do it in public and have a friend nearby. Abusive/controlling people get the most dangerous and manipulative when they are about to lose control on their target.  He will first beg for you to stay, promise the world that he will change, his love for you is the truest thing in this world,  etc.  That's the manipulation.   If you stay strong and still leave, he will blow up your phone with his true side, the hate and controlling (call you a slut, and other obscenities).  And he will cycle between both. 

Unfortunately women will less confidence, self worth, and no support system stay with their abusers. You are doing the right thing and leaving"
"There's a difference between going to someone's home, and going to a place of business AS LONG AS it's established they are utilizing their celebrity to make money at this location. It's sort of like Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash, a chain of comic shops owned by Kevin Smith. People come to these locations to do business, but also they come because they hope they'll get to meet Kevin Smith or Jason Mewes, or anyone from the View Askew movies. Kevin Smith purposefully chooses to use his celebrity for financial gain at his place of business. Going up to the Hollywood Hills to track down Kevin Smith, because one time /u/askmeaboutmynugs told you that he saw him out there on his cell phone while doing deliveries, is totally different and super creepy."
"&gt; Any advice?

run?

&amp;#x200B;

you can't wave a magic wand and make him an adult. He switched his momma for a new one. You are the new caretaker. She told you right to your face."
"I think that hiring a house cleaner once a month is not going to touch either of the issues that are bothering you.

I think you should say to them that you're ok with continuing to split the ""communal"" chores like sweeping, dusting, deep bathroom cleans, etc., but you have two conditions you want to add:

(a) That everyone cleans up their own daily messes, including toilet splatters.

--More direct version: ""I would like everyone to clean up after themselves on a daily basis. I've noticed that there are often splatters in the toilet, and I think those should be cleaned up by the person who makes them immediately, not left for the person whose turn it is to clean.""

-- Less direct version: ""I would like everyone to clean up after themselves on a daily basis. So any spills, personal food mess, or splatters in the toilet, for example, should be cleaned up by the person who made them.""

-- You can be more or less specific about how much you're focusing on the toilet thing, but I think you do have to mention it directly. Some people just think that poop goes in the toilet and that it's fine to leave it there. They may think, ""oh, yeah, of course I'll clean up my midnight snack dishes!"" and just not register poop splatters as something that's included in cleaning up after yourself. I know that sounds ridiculous, but if they were relatively self-aware people you wouldn't be having this conversation in the first place.

and (b), that the dog is theirs and not yours, so you want them to be solely responsible for cleaning up after it, including cleaning dog hair. Again, mention the dog hair specifically under the category of pet care, as they may be imagining that if they walk him and feed him they are already doing all the pet care.

And then I would also be open to asking them if they have points to add, too. Who knows, maybe you leave particular kinds of messes that bother them without realizing it."
Kind of sounds like she may have been sexually assaulted. Parents need to get her in therapy ASAP
Should someone who tries to chemical peel off the face of a comrade in arms really have the responsibility of keeping her comrades safe in a war zone? Or the responsibility of interacting respectfully with the local population? Because aldrin where I‚Äôm sitting this looks like a slow slide into war crimes territory.
"That's really not going to be comforting to L, is it?  

I think you know that you and L were in the early stages of a developing relationship, even if you hadn't officially put the label on it.  I don't know how L is going to react, but I know I'd be pretty upset about this."
"I just keep thinking about something you said at the beginning about things just working out for him. 

You've been doing everything for him. And he has literally done nothing to change that...."
"You threatened her with divorce after only 8 months after having a baby, her being abused at work, being force about of a job, and suffering from a mental illness? On top of that, she shared her vulnerabilities with you, yet you complain about having to be in dad mode with your kid around. Does she ever get to not be in mum mode? How often does she get a break?! She must be exhausted too from managing you if she is parenting you too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Damn it OP, you do not ""help out"" with the child and the home! They are yours! You have a responsibility to look after your house and child and doing those things are not a favour to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Her cut offs don\\t sound reasonable to me, but it sounds like she is in an awful situation. You guys need counselling because it seems like there is a lot going on."
"There‚Äôs something disturbing about how easily you said those things to your friend. It‚Äôs cruel for no reason.

I expect this from someone far younger than you, like a high school bully. Are these the sorts of thoughts you have on a day to day basis about everyday people?

Does your friend group encourage this? If so maybe you need new friends and to reset."
"Make him feel bad -- he should feel bad. Everyone on this sub always asks, ""how can I deal with this terrible trait in my partner without hurting their feelings."" You can't."
"While it's too soon to move solely for a relationship, it sounds like you were looking to move in general.  So why isn't there an option 2a - you look for a teaching job in the city where he lands a residency, and you still live separately?  That way you both have your independent lives if the relationship isn't stable.  However, I am not sure how teaching certification works in Australia, so if that's a problem, let me know.

In general, this is a good time in your life to take these kinds of risks as far as uprooting yourself.  But you need to have a plan in place so he is not the SOLE reason you are doing it.  Have your job in place, make independent friends and develop indepdent interests.  It's too early in this relationship to put this much stress on it, but if the move is part of a plan to build a new life in a new town, then it's only part of the risk.

Basically, you would be looping each other into your lives, not him consuming your life.  That's healthier in general - you make a better partner if you're a more rounded person."
"This might be a stretch / paranoia, but weird behavior changes can be a sign of neurological problems. Whatever he says about it eventually, if this is really out of character or if he doesn‚Äôt know why he did it, I would push him to go get an MRI."
"Precisely. Everyone wants a feel-good happy ending where everyone stops fighting. So when the abuser spills your business in the name of laying down arms, you look like the bad guy."
"I mean it's pretty easy considering she's allowing him to walk all over her and has been for three years.

I don't personally understand why people let it get to this point and then say they're not interested in breaking up when they should've high-tailed it ages ago, but what can you do I guess."
"I am so sorry - this sounds incredibly difficult and I am sorry you aren't getting meaningful or helpful support from your people.  Here is what I think you should say, to your family and friends who are pressuring you to forgive him, and to your boyfriend who wants to confront him:

  
""As you know, dating X was a difficult time in my life, and a time when I did not feel like I had a lot of control over what happened to me.  What would be most helpful for me right now is for you to respect me enough to allow me to handle this in the way I would like, instead of trying to take away my control over this situation with X.""  

&amp;#x200B;

You absolutely deserve to handle this in whatever way you see fit, AND I think you are entirely correct that ignoring this is the way to go.  (I would also consider screenshotting/saving the post in case this escalates, as an aside."
"This sounds like a medical issue. 

Also, look at the fiber content of the sheets, and switch to cotton."
"They do. I wanted children just until a few months ago too. I have decided recently without much agonizing that I will never have biological children for the exact same reason as OP's wife. Even though deep down I want several actually. I am open to adoption though. It happens to a lot more women than you can imagine. We are the ones bringing life but then we'll have to live with the fear of what future does this planet hold for the babies we made. It's a heartbreaking choice for us but it is pretty straightforward.

 My only criticism of OP's wife is that she should be open to adoption. Learn how to raise a child and then venture into fostering kids. Going from knowing nothing to fostering difficult children is a crazy thing to do."
"There's an excellent video about him by YouTube user ContraPoints, if you're curious. 

The long and short of it is that he uses a lot of rational-sounding rhetoric to wishy-washily imply some pretty bad things (ie trans people aren't people, women are naturally inferior to men and shouldn't have an education or expect not to get beat by their spouses, etc etc, stuff in that vein) without ever outright saying the bad things so that he has some plausible deniability and can deflect any arguments into a neverending useless rhetoric loop."
"You are making the right choice. The worst part of this is that even when he was confronted he lied to you about the condom usage, which put you at risk of getting and STI. This is completely and utterly disgusting and disrespectful. I'm glad you made the hard choice to leave - you deserve someone who cares for you and your health."
"Is it illegal? Is that your question? I am not a lawyer, but people are allowed to post honest stories of what happened. She's not faking the messages or saying anything untrue, right?

I think your best bet is to own up to this. Perhaps a public apology on the post. Admit your wrong doing and that you've learned from this and you are sorry for hurting your ex. 

&gt; This girl had made her uncomfortable. 

No, your relationship and your communication with someone outside your relationship made her uncomfortable. Being sorry starts by owning your part in this. YOU did this. No one else."
"Thank you for this reply. It gives me a lot to think about, and now I think I know how I will go around this topic."
"Hate to say, but I doubt NA sponsors are always the most stable/reliable people. You certainly didn't do anything wrong here. I think you should keep trying to find someone and recognize that, because of the nature of this organization, it might take a little time to find a healthy relationship with a sponsor."
"Your father needs to understand that just because someone is in a relationship with you doesn't mean that their labor should be free. Their time and efforts still have a value and to do such a task should not be done without some sort of repayment. Especially when you're trying to care for a pet that needs more care than your usual. He's just looking for excuses to dislike your boyfriend, I wouldn't sweat it. Its good that you are being responsible and thinking of ways to care for your pet"
"‚ÄúI want a divorce‚Äù is a complete sentence.

Go talk to a lawyer and get your ducks in a row first."
"If she refuses counseling/to do any work to make things better, you should divorce. And before you get married again, know that you AND your partner need to have a plan (career, education, share of household duties, where you'll live/if you move, what your partner will do to contribute to the household) before you consider making that commitment. 

she has given up all of her career in retail 

Let's be real. I have nothing against retail. My husband works in retail. A competent person can get a retail job ANYWHERE. My husband has worked for companies that have closed. He's relocated. He's never gone ‚Äî literally ‚Äî more than a couple weeks before he's found a new retail job. And not minimum wage ones. Supervisor roles. He has a ton of experience and is great at what he does. If she ""gave up her retail career"" to move with you, she's not trying hard enough to find a job. And before making a move like that, you should have had a conversation about what she planned to do in each town and formed a game plan before moving. ""Assume my husband will take care of everything"" should not be an option, and she doesn't get to sit back and whine that your lifestyle isn't up to her standards if she refuses to contribute. That's fucking ridiculous and I'm baffled as to why a) it wasn't established before you got married that she would be contributing and b) why you've pretended it's fine and not discussed this with her. 

If you love her and want to improve your marriage, you need to have a come to Jesus with her. But given that she uses divorce threats as a weapon (that's extremely low, and nobody should ever use that threat to manipulate their partner, that is fucked up) and refuses counseling, it sounds like it's time to leave. She'll survive, I promise you. If you wanna give it one more go you can lay it on the line for her, be honest about how you're feeling (lying and pretending it's fine is ridiculously counter productive) and give her a timeline to do real work to contribute to your household and for both of you to work on your abysmal communication skills. And a basic ground rule should be that any threats of divorce will mean you file papers immediately. 

But stop lying to her, stop pretending it's fine and stop doing nothing about your miserable situation. You need to either leave or level with her otherwise you're going to be in the same situation 5, 10, 20 years down the line."
Thank you for this! I‚Äôm going to show my drill sergeant the two bottles and ask them to move me.
" This made my skin crawl... what a nasty human being. No, narcissists do not change. It is one of the most destructive personality disorders because it is so hard for narcissists to admit they help. Please leave him for your sanity."
"You need to maintain your individual identity in a relationship.  She has to accept that and also do things on her own too.  I golf with the guys for an entire day.  Or build shit in my garage.  Or grab a few drinks at a pub.  All without my gf.  We do tons of stuff together too but I'm still me.  The guy I was when she met me.  The guy she loves for some reason, lol.  Are you still you?  Who were you before you met her?  Or are you both just ""the couple""?  An inseperable force of unified identity."
"Tell your husband about this latest incident and tell your BIL he is making you uncomfortable and you'd like for him to stop, even if he is just kidding.

  It doesn't sound like you have ever asked him to stop, and it is within your power to use your words (tell him to stop joking) and make it clear that kissing your neck crossed the line and you don't want it to happen again and the jokes have to stop.


Go from there. If he stops, great. If he doesn't, you'll need to make some big changes."
"It sucks you've been together so long as it can feel really hard to end it.

I was in a very similar situation for 7 years. It was hard. I frequently felt unloved and unappreciated because of it as I'm sure you do.

Eventually it got to the point that I just started pushing for what I needed very HARD. This resulted in lots of fights and her leaving me. At the time I was devastated. It was an extremely difficult breakup for me.

However now I'm dating someone who actually has the same kind of needs as me and it's fucking wonderful. I feel more loved and cared for than I did in all those 7 years. We have kinky sex constantly, she wants it more than even I can handle, and when we aren't having sex we are cuddling or holding hands or just generally touching each other in some way.

She even comes over when I'm in my desk chair working or playing at my computer and leans on my leg and reads her book just because she wants to be physically next to me.

It's so wonderful. It's still new and I don't know where it's going. But I've learned from it never to go back to having a relationship with someone who doesn't share my same need for intimacy and touch."
"I made this gimmick account a number of days ago just to see if it would be a hit since I could make a lot of jokes. In that sense, it has been a success. However, what I'm about to say is not a joke in any sense of the word, and I don't want you to see my username and write off my comment without reading it:

Do not say a single fucking thing about any of this right now. You have entirely too much preparation to do. Do your best to act as normal as you can until then, but do not have sex with him. This is of the utmost importance.

Here are the ducks that you need to get in a row:

1. Get tested for STDs immediately.
2. Get a divorce lawyer immediately. Do not let anyone know that you are meeting with this person. Do what your lawyer advises in terms of preparation for divorcing your husband. Mention that you can get evidence of the affair if needed.
3. Unless your lawyer tells you otherwise, your husband should not think you are divorcing him until he has papers in hand.

Your husband is nailed to the wall on this if you are careful and do not tip your hand."
"Sexual coercion is a deal breaker. Full stop.

Please break up and trust how yourself."
"&gt;How can we make sure he is okay, mentally?

Don't you think it's a bit late for that? I mean, he's obviously delusional. 

Talking to fans at meet and greets is what celebrities do. But all this stuff about 'she can't be with him because of her fame', 'they will date when her fame dies down' and so on... That's trademark catfishing stuff. Sounds like a friend is the one actually doing the catfishing, though.

If this woman had any real interest in him then she would actually be in direct contact with him. She's not, therefore this entire thing is in his head."
"I‚Äòm a YouTuber. Stuff like this is why I keep everything extremely privat. 

I know your mum is not trying to harm him, but her behaviour is very creepy and immature considering her age. 

It‚Äòs absolutely not okay to go to his workplace. Depending on what‚Äòs going to happen and what his employer is like, his job might be in jeopardy. 

How big is the channel? You could perhaps contact him and tell him about your mum‚Äòs plans, so that the can prepare himself in case she really shows up at his workplace."
This needs to be higher.
"I think I wanted to look at it more as a joke or stupid comment rather than a red flag towards toxicity, but you‚Äôre right. I have kind of been in denial about how shitty him saying that was for the past month and hearing other‚Äôs responses is an eye opener."
"I really expected something else when you said ""illegal shit"". She's not dealing drugs or stealing cars. 

What she does is completely fine within her moral sense and many others'. I'd not have a problem with any of those and would actually support or take part in some. What exactly are you worried about? Even if she got caught? It wouldn't have anything to do with you? 

But if you are not ok with it in the long term, you should have a serious talk about your future together. As usual."
"My husband (32M) and I (30F) have been together for nearly a decade, married for 7 years. He's my best friend, and I hang out with him more than anyone else because I enjoy his company. But when we went to visit my best friend in Canada (we live in the UK) he offered on multiple occasions to go find something to do, or stay in the flat whilst we went out so that we could have some alone time together. This was in another country, never mind a different state! 

I think your bf is the one being overly clingy and trying to make you feel guilty for wanting to spend time with your friend alone. This is not healthy in any relationship, he should be offering to find something to do so that the two of you can have some girl time! I understand he's out of work and has got into some pretty unhealthy sleeping patterns, but that is up to him to sort out. You can't be his only source of amusement and support, it's not fair on you and you will burn out."
"28? I was thinking more like 18. Talking late at night with another guy/girl is modern times oldest and clearest sign of cheating. Not necessairly physically, but at least emotionally. Why waist time on this girl?"
It‚Äôs good that it makes you cringe ‚Äî it means you recognize your mistake.
"It is, but seriously, I think the only moral thing for you to do here is to make sure the wife is aware of how much financial danger she is in to remain legally bound to this man. 

You might not be able to stop your friend from drowning himself if that is really what he wants, but you should speak up at least once in the effort to prevent him from taking someone else down with him."
"This! This is exactly what I think. S thinks we should give her the benefit of the doubt to avoid more drama, but I really don‚Äôt care about avoiding drama. I care about not having my face melt off because some lunatic decided to fuck with my shit. Thank you!"
"Go and get a lawyer and initiate divorce proceedings.

Have you confronted your sister?"
"What are you trying to accomplish here, OP?

If you just want to hookup, then hookup (in a safe, sane, consensual, and mature way, of course). Sounds like you're doing that already but don't like it much.

If you're looking for something more, then approach it with that goal in mind. That means patience, lots of trial and error, and slowing things down."
"Does she have a relative (sibling, cousin, in-law) closer to her age you feel comfortable with? If so, it might be worth bringing this up with them to get their input and maybe even encourage them to talk to her. If your mom is this out of touch with reality there‚Äôs probably a large part of her that has trouble seeing you as an adult and taking your advice seriously. Other than that, unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything else you can do. You brought it to her attention that what she was planning was messed up, and she disregarded your advice. Whatever the consequence is, it‚Äôs on her."
"You‚Äôre entitled to not stay in a relationship that will give you what you need but..

Honestly you‚Äôre an asshole for wanting this much control over your future wife. I‚Äôm amazed that people like you still exist. 

Please continue to tell future girlfriends of your plans before anything gets too serious."
"And yell it loud enough that his wife can hear. She deserves to know, the poor thing."
"Have you brought up your concerns to your girlfriend?

Guys like these usually hang around waiting for the girl to have a vulnerable moment and then make their move."
"Dude, you're a 36 year old man with a bed time. What's wrong with you that you allowed that? 
She needs to get help if she is that clingy, there is a history there that definitely needs some work. But I'm more concerned as to why you let someone give you a bed time."
"This is the main thing pushing me to tell cadre. I feel so fucking stupid even posting this, but this could also end someone‚Äôs career. So I‚Äôm glad someone else is on my side with this one! Thank you!"
Please for the love of god hide your toothbrush.
"OP, oddly enough ignoring her may work. People like her need attention good or bad. Ignoring them denies them the attention they crave. She might do an extinction burst where she does it more frequently before stopping, but using the grey rock method is polite yet does the trick. Lots of ""Thats nice"" ""k cool"" (unenthused) ""ummmhmm"". References to grey rocking online have further info and replies."
"Throwing the remote at the TV and hitting his girlfriend on the arm both raised major red flags for me.  He feels he deserves things and when he doesn't get them, he acts out in a violent manner.  I'm glad OP is making a stand and I do understand how hard it is for her."
Do not compromise activities that strengthen your life and your character for a 5-month boyfriend. Basic life lesson.

"Tell your sister. At 33, she should have the knowledge and maturity to not blame you, and instead place the blame where it rightfully goes.

&amp;#x200B;

But, the thing is, this dude is a career predator and he's practiced and he won't give up. He will try to use his leverage to sleep with you again and again."
"Don't bother begging or chasing or pining for her.  You've communicated your needs a million times.

My advice is the next conversation to go something like this: you tell her that you've communicated to her what your needs are, and how desperate you are to feel loved, you've talked about what needs to change and nothing happens.  The next step is a fork in the road; either you both go visit a marriage counselor and she drop the ""this is your problem"" attitude and start taking responsibility for her part in your collapsing marriage (you may have had a role in it as well, but she doesn't get to unilaterally decide that the romantic relationship is over and you're just gonna shut up and sit down), or you two go to a divorce attorney and work out an amicable divorce and custody/co-parenting arrangement before the resentment gets any worse.  

Don't let her shut that down like she did before.  Her chosing to not go to marriage counseling should be a choice to divorce.  You're essentially letting her dictate your life being miserable and unloved at this point."
"sitting your wife, who is suffering from PPD, down for a divorce ultimatum eight months after childbirth is not particularly patient or supportive.  that is still in the thick of night feeding, diapers, and all the other stresses that an infant brings.  I am not sure when his demands started for a wife who was happy, and happy to have him go out once a week with his friends, but if it was anywhere close to the eight month mark, that is wildly unrealistic, even without the PPD.  the first year is still all-hands-on-deck, maybe-we-curtail-our-social-life, let's-just-get-through-this territory.  not that he shouldn't get to go out ever but demanding once a week, with no limits on how late he's out, is not realistic for most families."
"She sounds ridiculously self-absorbed. The fact that you say she has a history of cutting people off, and you just never thought it would be you shows that this is a recurring problem....it just wasn't a big deal to you because it didn't affect you as much. Think back over the last ten years....how often has she been incredibly selfish with things you just put up with...I'm guessing this isn't the first. 


Based on the title, the only other thing I could think is that she knows the engagement is a bad idea and is over projecting and wants everyone to be excited (ie: someone in an abusive relationship trying to convince themselves it is great). But that doesn't sound like what this is....this is just her being self centered."
"I agree, and I just wanna tack on a tiny little footnote: You said he has a lot of growth to do, and while it isn't OP's *responsibility* to help him grow up, breaking up with him will be a milestone for both of them when he gets slapped in the face with the reality that he can't be a possessive hypocritical douchebag and expect everything to be fine. Both OP and her ex will walk away from this and become more adult as a result. 

Just as a note as well, I'm 25 and going through something very similar."
"Exactly. If she gets kicked out after OP reports her, it is not OP's fault. If she didn't do anything wrong in the first place, nothing would happen. It's kinda like running full speed into a wall: sure, the wall brakes your nose, but it was not like the wall ran into you."
"Yeah, the first thing he‚Äôs gonna do is find a woman with low self esteem and just do the same thing to her."
"&gt;He goes on these rants and it gets to the point where I just feel so upset that I give in to having sex with him or having oral sex where I‚Äôm miserable every second of it

Been there and it really fucks you up mentally. It just makes you feel used and like a sex toy. I wouldn't be surprised if part of your low libido is in response to this. When my ex started pulling this shit, my libido went from normal to six feet under. 

Leave."
"I hate to put this in blunt terms but your husband is raping you, manipulating you, and abusing you.  You need to leave for your own sake, as well as for your children.  Leave today."
Drunk words = sober thoughts
"I could understand the reaction if it had been something serious and she needed support then (illness or death of a love one). But because someone is ""low energy over your engagement"" she is throwing a tantrum, she needs to get over herself."
"Well, when I did this (only it was my mom that did the cheating), I didn't confront my mom. I was so disgusted that I straight up told my dad and never told my mom. To this day she still doesn't know it was me that found out about the cheating. But I keep a good realtionship with both nontheless... I would tell him."
It‚Äôs a tough subject since she‚Äôs so sensitive about it. Plus I don‚Äôt even know how to approach the subject
"She's got a forked tongue. She's already started whispering untruths about you in everyone's ears. And, it's not so she can burn your face. That was impulsiveness from a youthful psychopath. She's quickly going to hone her skills, do something horrible to someone else, and make sure you take the fall. Your career and lifetime reputation are on the line. I don't think you realize how devious psychopaths are. This is your chance to protect your career. That's why you have to report it."
"But this one ""small"" thing is stressing you out so badly you're going on /r/relationships for relationship help. What happens when you get a call from her in a jail cell? Are you ready for that?"
"No kidding.

One comment about the dress.
One moment of not loving every minute of the party beforehand.

Bleurgh."
I agree with this wholeheartedly. Your brother‚Äôs being manipulated just the same.
"So, this part is of some concern:

&gt; I will say that she is nice to my face, but she does some shady shit behind my back. For example, when I leave the room, she talks mad shit about me to our other roommate, S, saying that I don‚Äôt belong in the military and that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúlittle bitch‚Äù for being medically discharged (I sustained fractures to both legs and a break to my already-once-broken foot during training lol). When I‚Äôm not around, she calls her mom and obsessively talks about how she can‚Äôt stand me, how I‚Äôm annoying when I talk to my boyfriend, how she hates how I wear my makeup, etc. (All of this is being reported to me by S, who made me swear not to say anything about it to K).

Have you seen any *direct* evidence of animosity directed your way from K, or is *all* of your information about it coming from what S is telling you?

Because if S (for whatever reason) either wanted to drive a wedge between you and K (because you had been best friends since Basic, and perhaps she felt left out) or she just wanted K to look bad for reasons unrelated to you, this situation is more or less *exactly* how that would look as well.

I'd be careful about going up the chain to your cadre and accusing someone of something like this based on a history of animosity that you have only been *told* about.

If you have direct evidence that K has actually become hateful toward you, that you have seen/experienced on your own, then that's a different picture."
"You might benefit from Tina Swithin's resources on navigating Family Court and trying to deal with an unstable/malicious co-parent. She's got books/workshops/online groups/etc.   


You are going to have to go through mediation/the court, but you will get a better outcome if you've been really extensively documenting every time she fails at parenting or doesn't follow through on something. Whenever your son misses out on something because she doesn't feel like doing it, LOG IT. Date, time, situation."
"I know plenty of girls like your gf.

They all sensitive and defensive at their social addictions.

In the end I learned that the best way to communicate with these people is to show them that socials don't matter and they are a waste of time.

I deleted all my accounts (but reddit, which has a different scope than ego boosting) and showed them I didn't care about their last pic or my own popularity.

These kind of people have a twisted take on reality which is reinforced by all the people surrounding them caring about these pics and likes.

The only way to communicate with them (but might be pointless) is to show:

- a ) you don't care

- b) tell them straight they are obsessed with their socials and that you see that as a major turn off."
I can see why you're mad.  I don't know why people are giving you shit for being upset.  She should have discussed it with you before hand as I'm sure she'd be pissed if you met up with an ex and told her as an afterthought...
"OP, did you even want to have ‚Äúthe kid‚Äù? What did you think parenting was going to be? I know social media makes it look like lots of matching outfits, field trips, and fun, but you had to know you‚Äôd have to adjust your lifestyle, no?"
"&gt;And he really does, he is very kind and sweet to me and to his friends , but to all other people he is honestly a piece of shit.

Then he's kind of a piece of shit right now. You don't get judged by how you treat the people you like the most, you get judged by how you treat everyone. Also long term he's not going to manage being perfectly nice to you while being an utter asshole to everyone including your friends, you're destined for the same behavior if he doesn't change. 

Honestly it seems to me like he did all these things to fill the hole inside him and it didn't work because it was never about things or accomplishments and entirely about how he views himself, now he's got to project because his other option is to admit this didn't work and he still has a problem. If that's the case then either he gets help or he gets worse, this perfect little dichotomy of him managing asshole outside and hubby inside isn't going to last.

I wouldn't just break up with him but I would predicate a continued relationship on him fixing his unacceptable behavior, although odds are if he isn't willing to work on it he's going to strike out at you and you'll have out yourself in the other camp along with most people."
"&gt;She often told me that in a couple of years we both would have grown and a new relationship would be possible and that I was the man she wants to get old with

This almost always translates to ""please keep liking me while I sleep with other guys, as my ego benefits from feeling like I have options"". It's not *conscious* or *malicious* of her, but this is what the excuse means in practice. It almost never actually translates to real, sustained intent to date you again after another few years.

&gt;So she now got very very angry and told that I am an asshole for wanting her to move out earlier (I cannot move out earlier because all the contracts are singed by me and if I moved out she had no legal point staying in the Appartement)

You're broken up. This is what broken up people do - move out.

&gt;All in all I am not sure if I decided fair because in fact it is her life and I have no right to blame her and maybe have no right to change our agreement that she moves out in September just because she got a boyfriend.

Don't be a doormat. *You have the right to change your mind*, especially because circumstances changed.

Get her out, you're broken up, she shouldn't expect more. This being your first relationship, you might not know it's ok to expect this - but it is."
"&gt;  if not he would just be setting at home by himself

He can't handle being alone at home...? That is a basic adult life skill."
Please don‚Äôt apologize. She‚Äôs ridiculous.
Seriously OP check your condoms for holes.
"This sounds like you have some deeper problems that would be best addressed in counseling. As far as right now, check out the comic ""You Should Have Asked"" and share it with him to give him a sense of how exhausting it is to not only be in charge of everything in the household, but to have to do the extra labor of delegating when you want something done by him. It sounds like you are just plain exhausted all the time and instead of recognizing that and helping you, he is demanding more of your energy without giving any in return."
"Well, I actually go to bed around 9-10 each night, sometimes earlier, but I get up around 4-5. The early bedtime isn't that strange to me, but insisting OP join her is. 

Ways my boyfriend and I get around this are to spend some time winding down together, and when I fall asleep, he goes and does his own thing. Or I take a nap so I can stay up later. I love that he takes the time to do so, and the time we spend together is 85% focused on each other.

In contrast, my ex-husband just ignored me all the time in favor of games, wrestling, and internet surfing. There was no cuddling or spending quality time together, and I probably acted more like OP's GF in that situation, because I was frustrated and depressed that no matter how I phrased it or handled it, I was getting no attention or help around the house.

OP, I'm not saying this is your situation, especially after reading some comments of yours, but it might be worth talking to her about what she considers quality time and why it's so important to go to bed at the same time, even though that's not your sleep schedule. You sound like a pretty kind guy."
Yep. He's counting on her being too shocked to say anything. Call him out on his shit.
Honestly I'd break up with him. If he's not willing to be responsible for his half of birth control than he's not someone you can have sex with.
"That‚Äôs.. maybe something to look into in more depth.

A healthy relationship allows for time spent with other people regardless of why. I would feel shitty if I wanted to catch up with an old friend but she insisted on always bringing her boyfriend"
"I had dinner at the counter of a restaurant with Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys sat right next to me. He's my all time favourite singer, but after wrestling with the idea, I didn't interrupt his date.  There's 'public mode' and there's just going for a quiet bite to eat."
Right but then you say ‚ÄúI go to bed at 9 because I work early‚Äù or something like that. Having a bedtime imposed on you by another person at 36 years old is ridiculous.
You can't prove anything but you can report that you don't feel safe and request a move.
"If he‚Äôs equally macho, and makes a lot of money with long hours, like selling cars, the whole thing could work. They have the kind of kids who figure out how to bully their teachers. A little slice of functional dysfunction."
"Has to be the case in my opinion, who doesn't bring along a long time bf/gf as support for something like that?"
"If he was living alone, would he not have to do the housework even of he was working 150 hours a week. Okay, what about the weekend. They are both free. Why is he expecting her to clean while he plays games. Can't they clean their house together?"
"Tell him you are done and have nothing left in the tank.

Have accommodation plans.

Maybe re-route your mail and change email passwords and things in advance.

Don't be vindictive and be as non-confrontational as possible.

Wherever possible amicable splits are better in the long run and also a hell of a lot cheaper."
Okay most people can‚Äôt just go away and camp for 2 weeks. üòÇüòÇ
"Your shallowness was your downfall. Learning experience, let him move on."
"You and your sister are financially dependent on this man. So it‚Äôs a very tricky situation. 

I would recommend you get a summer job and move out ASAP. And then after you‚Äôve moved out, tell your sister. 

She will hopefully divorce him and et spousal support. But that‚Äôs not a guarantee. 

You may also consider going to the police, what he did might be considered a crime since you were drunk. If you feel up to it, you can go down to the station today and file a report. But you might want to wait until you have a job and secure housing."
"I feel like bringing the gift is even worse! A random stranger stalking you and bringing something that could potentially be poisonous if it‚Äôs food, have a camera in it, have razor blades or something else in it that makes it dangerous would mean I wouldn‚Äôt accept it or I‚Äôd throw it away immediately."
"&gt; My dad is not a bad person 

Isn't he, though? 

&gt; I'm angry at both of them. 

... why? Because your boyfriend won't, in your own words, "" suck it up and play nice"" with a man who refused to even acknowledge him for years because of his skin color? That's *completely reasonable*. 

&gt; I know he would love those kids and would never make them feel different. 

That's quite the claim to make. He was perfectly willing to destroy his relationship with YOU, his own daughter, over your boyfriend's race. 

Here's what you do. Stop sitting on the fence. Accept that your father is, in fact, a bad person in some ways. Stop looking down on your boyfriend for refusing to respect a man who has done nothing nothing to show he's worth respecting. Live your life together, have kids if you want, and if your father decides to apologize and ask forgiveness, then think about introducing your kids to him. Until then, stop making like this is some equal argument between two equally stubborn men. One of those men hates people because of the color of their skin. The other doesn't want his children exposed to that kind of hatred. Those two positions are NOT comparable, and your willingness to even present them as such is profoundly disturbing."
"It sounds like you both are too different on fundamental levels. She likes taking risks, while you're risk averse. Y'all probably would do better by finding more similar people to yourselves"
"Tell him if he wants to keep his wife,

that it is."
"That is a serious red flag.  I miss my husband terribly when he is out of town for work, but it is something you deal with as an adult. We have even had to do separate vacation/trips on occasion due to family/work obligations. Being able to be alone is something adults need to be able to do. He is essentially making you responsible for his well being which is not right to expect of a partner. 

Not really the point, but for your visit find him a movie to go to for two hours and then have lunch or dinner with your BF and catch up. That is a very simple solution to a the surface issue in your relationship. If he hems and haws at even this then he is too clingy and codependent and you will slowly be suffocated in this relationship (which already sounds like it is happening)."
"He's not joking when he is drunk either. Your brother in law is being creepy and disrespectful and using the ""it's just a joke"" as an excuse to keep pushing boundaries without people calling him out. Talk to your husband. Next time he does this also call him out publicly and loudly."
"Oh boy. Yea my ex refused to go to couple counselling because it was too expensive... all I heard was ‚Äúmy booze and computing are more important than this relationship‚Äù 

I made my moves and left... after when I was packing he tried to blame me for not wanting couples counselling... like what I wasn‚Äôt fighting you tooth and nail to go??? Ugh just noped out."
"You can‚Äôt work it out if his response is to gaslight you about it. You threatened to divorce him and he called your bluff. If he‚Äôs not taking responsibility and not taking you seriously, he won‚Äôt stop cheating. If you‚Äôre not willing to divorce, then you should learn how to live with your husband and sister betraying you."
"Ask her if the YouTuber is a mind reader. Assuming she says no, ask her how he will know she has no bad intentions. To him she's just a random stranger trying to give him something in a place where he should feel safe."
Congrats you can yeet both of these people out of your life now.
Here's an upvote for the thorough roach advice lmao
"No dont reach out.  This friendship is over unless she reaches out to you.  She's following the husband's lead.  You probably had a chance if you could've explained the initial issue of dropping the kid, but him hearing you calling his kid  an asshole buries you."
"You sound like an amazing person with a good head on your shoulders. This is going to hurt, theres no escaping it. Marriage is tough, and he sounds weak. You deserve so much better.

And the obligatory reddit suggestion of therapy. This is going to cause trust issues in your next relationship otherwise."
"Just one word of caution: 

&gt;K and I have been best friends since basic combat training, so I don‚Äôt know where her sudden animosity toward me came from.   
&gt;  
&gt;Ever since we became roommates at AIT (Advanced Individual Training), she‚Äôs been acting differently. 

So it all started when you became roommates with S, too!

And all of the bad behavior of K was told to you by S, right?

Are you sure, S is not telling K similar bad stories about your behavior?

Perhaps S is trying to separate you and K for whatever crazy reasons."
The gift is her excuse for seeing him in person.
"&gt; Imagine what she'll be like planning the wedding.

Eeek. I shudder to think about it. 

Just let her be and enjoy the emotional peace of not having to help her.

If you think this drama queen isn't going to guilt trip OP (for not groveling and begging to help with the wedding), I think you're wrong. Or she'll magically forgive OP so she can assign her all kinds of wedding tasks."
"This! Housework is a shared responsibility, it is no more your job than his. I would be tempted to tell him you're only willing to clean as much as he does. It is not fair on you to be expected to do practically everything. I bet he thinks raising a child is solely down to a woman as well.

I'm saying this as a man, this could be an eternal struggle for you. Please think about what you need in a relationship. Having a partner who is cold &amp; moody as well as a hypocrite doesn't sound ideal, you deserve better.

Wish you all the best for the future!"
"&gt; He then launched a game and told me to clean.

He's not your dad. He's supposed to be your partner. I lost 4 years of my life in a relationshit similar to this. Cut your losses and move out. You'll love yourself for it in the end. There are men out there that actually give a shit and are worth your time. ‚ô•"
"It doesn't sound like you're much older than 50, if that, so you could conceivably have 25-50 more years before you shuffle off this coil. You can't get those years back, but you can make sure the next 22 are much better. I got divorced right after I turned 50, and yes, parts of it have been a struggle, but overall it's been one of the best things I've done. Don't let any more time slip away."
"You need to talk to them about the toilet.

""Guys, I've noticed lately that the toilet has some residue, and it really puts me off. Can we all make an effort to use a toilet brush if there's anything that a flush didn't remove?""

Also, you can make cleaning a bit better- get a foaming, bleach spray toilet cleanser, and when you wipe it down use disposable gloves. Frequently bleach a toilet brush.

You also could just divide the chores and always do kitchen and not bathroom."
"Cement, Mango, Yes, and the Dead One\*"
"I should specify. We have 5 kids combined. He has 3 from a previous marriage. We get them on the weekends and I do not homeschool them. 2 at home all the time. 
I definitely need alone time as well, but I value my time with him more."
"Yeah, it sounds like your suspicions are correct.  How is he around you?"
"Just a note... It's not ""helping"" you, it is taking care of his *own children and house*. It is not all your job, and shouldn't be."
So.. my advice is to go off of that and say fuck it. It will be scary the next time with someone but if you never try you‚Äôll never know
"Thank you! I really appreciate your advice!

And haha seriously! I‚Äôm an E-4 and I am currently regretting *not* initiating a contract marriage lololoool!"
Why are you uncomfortable about a dinner with a client where her mom will be present? What could you possibly think will happen under those circumstances?
"I was wondering the age of his past girlfriends as well.

My first husband was like this in ways but it turned out he got worse as time went on and was eventually diagnosed with a serious mental illness.  It was always evident but being younger (10 years) and desperate for love, I ignored every sign.  It ruined 25 years or more of my life."
"$20,000 is retirement savings and an emergency fund for injuries or illness. 

It is not money to just blow on travel. 

Stick to your career plan as if you had $0 in inheritance. 

Your dad isn‚Äôt withholding the money because he doesn‚Äôt approve. This isn‚Äôt like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt approve of your tattoo‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt approve of your hair color‚Äù. He is worried that you, being young and bipolar, will make poor decisions with the money and then regret it later.

Show him he‚Äôs wrong by speaking with a financial advisor about the best way to handle $20,000. (The answer is, don‚Äôt touch it at all, put it in some kind of secure investment so it collects interest.)"
"OP, you say breaking up it‚Äôs not an option because when things are good they are ‚Äúseriously perfect‚Äù, I submit to you that A sandwich with a sliver of excrement it‚Äôs still a shit sandwich."
"Some bosses will also try to get the reasonable employee to become more accommodating to the crazy one, since that‚Äôs easier than vice versa."
"&gt;‚ÄúCan you blame her?‚Äù Uh, yeah I think you can.

Right!? I completely understand feeling wistful at seeing your child grow up and leave their parents behind... but that's also what any decent parent *should* want. A child doesn't exist to give their parent attention, and a parent shouldn't want or expect their child to focus on doing so."
"fun story: when my hubs and I got engaged ((almost a decade ago)) our discussion went this direction. He didn't want to clean, so we compromised and have had a 2 -3 times a month cleaning service in to do all the 'big stuff': bathrooms, floors, stove, ceiling fans, windows, etc.

We split the dishwasher. Icook and do most fo the dishes. He does laundry. We haven't fought about cleaning since.

Best decision ever."
She needs to do a inventory and check herself before she wrecks herself.
"So basically you‚Äôll deal with his crap because you‚Äôre scared of being alone?

You‚Äôre 20. This is most likely not the person you will be with forever. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúslight inconvenience‚Äù if a grown man can‚Äôt stay home alone or find something to do while you visit a friend. It‚Äôs ridiculous. He‚Äôs not getting frustrated or not understanding. He doesn‚Äôt want you to see her alone and he‚Äôs getting his way by acting like this. 

There‚Äôs no easy solution here. Either you tell him he can‚Äôt always come with you or you quit seeing your friend much."
"&gt; she can't forget me and looks for me in every man, only to realize that I'm not there anymore. Said she cried for weeks after our divorce, and simply can not forget me. ""I can't really be myself with anyone else...

Well boohoo. She should've thought of that before she cheated on you. I wouldn't go talk to her if I were you. You already know that she reacts to hardship by cheating. The fact that she's trying to get you to meet up with her while she's still in a relationship shows that she has apparently not learned to be faithful yet either. She needs to sort herself out and you are much better off detaching from the whole this. You're already a year out, you've already picked your lie back up. Don't get sucked back in."
"&gt;Thank you for this! I‚Äôm going to show my drill sergeant the two bottles and ask them to move me.

It's a great idea to show the normal soap for visual comparison. Good idea. Keep your stuff hidden though in case she tries to take the contaminated pine sol bottle lol I wouldn't put it past her."
Taking her back would be the biggest mistake of your life. Have some respect for yourself and leave her in the dust! You deserve far better than being someone's backup plan.
"There is nothing less attractive than a misogynistic manchild, yuck."
"This. She's already wasted 6 years with this dolt, so if she really doesn't want to break up with him then get used to the disrespect and abuse, cause this is who he is, there's no ""fixing"" him or having a productive discussion about this cause he doesn't respect her or her needs."
"Yeah, agreed to both points. This seems like a ""your freedom to swing your fist doesn't outweigh my freedom to not get punched in the face"" kind of moment to me. 

I hate it when people insist on adamantly defending their purely intellectual positions to people actually affected by the issue at hand, or ""playing devil's advocate.""

As the saying goes, the devil has enough advocates (and I wouldn't want to date one.)"
"Or the ""friend"" that he facetimes is maybe just someone who looks like the person that's known to hang around with FG. Never underestimate the amount of self-deception that people can do."
"In theory I think it‚Äôs great for people to have experience living alone, and Reddit is super in favor of it, but it‚Äôs not always practical in every situation. Do YOU want to do this? Can you even afford it? I feel like it is an awfully big hoop for him to make you jump through if you don‚Äôt kind of want to try it for your own sake, and especially if you can‚Äôt afford to do it responsibly. It seems to me like an awfully presumptuous ask when he went into the relationship knowing what your experience level was."
Ya. This guy is acting like a pig. He seems to the type that thinks a girlfriend is a sex machine. You can do better.
"Absolutely, we did discuss our marriage issues and I put my hands up to my misgivings. I need to work on myself and what I did wrong in this relationship to ensure I go forward as a better person too. 

We‚Äôre both to blame for the marriage being where it was and that‚Äôs also a tough pill to swallow because I will wonder until the end of days about whether I could have been a better wife and this may not have happened. 

Thanks for your advice, I will look into those groups!"
Yeah that‚Äôs concerning. There‚Äôs just no reason to hold her waist and linger. That‚Äôs what lovers do in the kitchen
"She's going to be a bridezilla, guaranteed....so thank your lucky stars that you're not subjected to her nonsense"
Thank you so much for this! This is a great guide to presenting what I need to say. I‚Äôm going to speak to cadre with this after I take another soldier to her appointment.
I'm heading off on vacation tomorrow and we have tickets to this event together with his friends. I dont really know what to do
"Not to be too harsh, but this is a prime example of ""sorry they got caught.""

You can't make him un-see what you wrote.  And believe it or not, hurtful critical things you say could have an effect on the people around you.  You could try telling/expressing to him everything you said here and hoping he takes it well, but that probably won't happen and chances are he's moving on.

Maybe take this as a lesson that not every negative and critical thought that crosses your mind needs to be outwardly expressed, most especially about people whom you might invite into your life.  Be they friends or dates or potential romantic partners.  I say expressed because texting is the same as saying, maybe worse because there's evidence of it."
"&gt;You made a tasteless joke

Five bucks and a basket of chinchillas says OP has said MANY hurtful things under the guise of ""I'm just joking"" and girlfriend has finally had enough."
Yea - no one says you have to be friends with your sister.  Plenty of people are close w/their siblings growing up and then drift apart as adults.
"Sounds like the bigger issue is y‚Äôall can‚Äôt stand to be apart. 

That‚Äôs not good and is gonna burn out quickly.  Maybe your friend doesn‚Äôt like him for a good reason."
"When you say he plays a lot of gigs, how often are we talking? You don't say how long you've been together so it's hard to tell if you have gone to 10 shows in a month or 10 in a couple years. I think that will color my advice. You definitely can't stop going altogether.

In general, no, you don't have to love his music as long as you're supportive. However, I'm an artist and I will say that if my boyfriend didn't like my work it would crush me. My ex told me he ""wasn't a fan of my style"" when I was vulnerable enough to share something with him and I never got over it. I'm not saying you'd be insensitive enough to actually say that to him, but to a certain extent it's hard to hide and I can personally pretty clearly tell the difference between someone sucking it up when they see something they don't like and someone who is enthusiastically into it. I think you need to think about the potential effects it'll have on him if you legitimately hate the art he makes. Art isn't just a job, it's part of the soul of the person creating it."
"You love him because you have issues on the inside you need to work out (hey, we ALL do). Now that you know it‚Äôs fixable, ditch this guy babe. You know you‚Äôre worth more. Go no contact."
"You are headed towards divorce. Unless she earnestly undertakes counseling, I would talk to a lawyer to understand my options, responsibilities, and financial implications. After this I would only then inform her that without a serious attempt to resolve these issues, that you will be separating and seeking shared custody, leading to divorce.  In the meantime, get yourself in shape, because you may soon be looking for a new partner."
"Second this. Healthy relationships are sustained by more than just love. Compatibility, communication, and mutual respect are at least as important to good relationships as love.

OP, it sounds like this relationship is not working for you. Your SO's jealousy and insecurity are concerning, and it sounds like his double standards are a deal breaker for you (rightly so). It's okay to leave a relationship at any time for any reason. Move on and find one that checks all your boxes and works for you."
 Ruined the relationship
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to visit my friends/family. See you later.‚Äù
"I think this is the most palatable way to get around it. If you can't stop her, redirect her to a more appropriate route - and after this, consider talking to her about why she feels so attached to this YouTuber. She may need to talk to someone professional if it turns out to be a larger problem."
"I don't mean to sound so cold, but this is exactly why so many pet enthusiasts caution people who do not have the means of taking care of exotic (or even common) pets from getting them in the first place.

Pets take a lot of time, effort, and above all else MONEY. It worries me a little here to see that you had no plan or savings set aside to leave such a high maintenance pet for 17 days.

&gt; but I guess it‚Äôll have to come from my own savings, which will suck.

Of course you should be able to provide for your own pets/plants. ""Can I afford it?"" is the first question everyone should ask themselves before taking on the responsibility of another life. 

I agree with another comment that recommended that you look up the going rates are for pet sitting in your area. If not for the purpose of paying your boyfriend, then to better inform yourself for future planning in the case that you need to leave your pets again and nobody is around to take care of them."
"&gt; this could also end someone‚Äôs career. 

If someone this unstable, immature, and unsociable is allowed to serve in the military it could cost someone their life. 

Think about that for a second. If she really is this much of a psycho she has no business in the armed forces."
Did you try speaking to a therapist? I read your original post and it kinda sounded like your biggest issue with your dad was that you see how your like him when you‚Äôre angry.
"I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly.  If I got some real help (without having to ask) it would go an extremely long way.  The way it sits I have a ""third shift"" of cleaning after the kids are asleep which rolls into the night when the baby and toddler still wake up fairly regularly.  When I come down from putting the little ones to bed he expects intimacy from me immediately when I'm still detoxing from carrying/hugging children all day long.  It feels like more work to me sometimes."
"To be clear, I am NOT blaming you.  I just found that I was able to move ahead and make better choices in my relationships going forward when I took stock.

One of the worst days of my life was sitting in my therapists office realizing that the divorce was not my fault and I couldn't fix it on my own.

I would have gladly taken the blame if it meant I could fix it. But I am also super codependent. blergh. workibg on it."
she has expressed a racist sentiment by associating with openly racist people
You sound like you have your shit together and he doesn't.
why would you want to stay friend with a cheater?
"It won't end her career. Drill sergeants deal with this kinda shit every single cycle of students that come through. They've seen it all and are probably tired of it unfortunately. For this reason, it will be easy for them to roll their eyes and not take it seriously, so it's important that you express to them that you're trying to document this behavior (do your best to be factual and the least dramatic you can possibly be) and try to get moved away from her.  
Her career will be unaffected until she does something more extreme."
Thank you so much :)
"Talking to her about it is key. Try to approach it slowly, and not negatively.

Something like a small comment like, ""you're already gorgeous, GF. #nofilter""

Try asking her questions about her IG before telling her that she doesn't need to photoshop her photos. DO NOT for any reason say that it's a turn off. You can say,

""Help me understand why you need to spend hours fixing up perfection"".

I dunno just some thoughts. Hope it's helpful."
"Wait.. iif you are traveling to another country, it would be illegal to bring weed from one to another. So not only is he making you uncomfortable, he is breaking the law and could risk being turned away at the border of the country he's trying to enter. I am guessing you are either from the US or Canada, OP?"
"I can see her point, if I didnt get to see my best friend much I'd be pretty annoyed if her boyfriend tagged along every single time too.

You keep saying he has nowhere to go, but come on, he cant even go to the cinema and watch a movie alone for 2 hours? It sounds more like you're making excuses and I really dont think its healthy to be this attached to each other to the point he cant stand to be alone"
"Yeah, when you're 18 dating a 26 year old and *you're* the mature one, this is why he went for someone about 2/3 his age. The threat to hit you should have been an instant dealbreaker, and I don't know why the cocaine use wasn't. Red flags shouldn't be ignored."
"This is the only area where he demonstrates this behavior.  There is no issue when I initiate.  In the early years of our relationship I had no issue initiating what was, in retrospect, the majority of the time.  The kids have taken an expected toll on my sleep and stamina where I am exhausted a good portion of the time once they are asleep for the day."
"Hey that really sucks. I don't think it does any good speculating why she's done this but I just want to remind you that it's nothing you did and you don't deserve to be treated that way. 
You did the right thing blocking her,  that was brave.
I really hope you find someone soon to have those types of good times with again and that she appreciates it and wants it as much as you do! All the best :)"
There are plenty of 20-year-olds that are financially independent. OP just isn't one of them.
"This sums it up. She‚Äôs proven that she wants someone else but is now unsure that she will be able to find someone else who is better than OP. She will always be looking to upgrade from OP. 

He needs to cut all contact with her and move forward in his life"
It may be a medical issue than can be remedied with medication! My husband sweats profusely constantly but recently got prescribed a medicine that completely 100% fixes it.
"What do you mean she ‚Äúclaims‚Äù to have a 2 week period? If that‚Äôs in fact true, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs unreasonable for her to not feel comfortable having sex while she‚Äôs bleeding. Some women are fine having sex on their period and others aren‚Äôt. She may feel bloated, crampy, and just not sexy. Long periods sound absolutely horrible and I think you‚Äôre being unreasonable in this regard. Has she considered going on birth control to regulate her periods?

&amp;nbsp;

I‚Äôm also a little confused as to why you say she doesn‚Äôt appreciate you but then go on to say how she tells all her friends she‚Äôs lucky to have you and she also tells you she appreciates everything big and small. Maybe you two just have different love languages. How many kids do you two have? It‚Äôs completely possible to feel all ‚Äútouched out‚Äù after being around kids and/or work. As an introvert, I get it.

&amp;nbsp;

Does she ever get time completely alone? I would make sure she‚Äôs getting that. Take the kids out to dinner and a movie and give her some space. And then find another night where you guys can go on an actual date. I would also suggest not only individual therapy for both of you (and then couples therapy after) but a sex therapist. If she says no, you need to firmly tell her that your marriage may not make it otherwise."
"Actually back when we had the ""do you want kids some day"" talk, he mentioned that if i wanted to one day raise our child in Washington (or wherever), he would be down to go because we would be a family unit then.

However now there has been a lot of backtracking from that comment :(  I'm not saying we have to go to my home state I just want to not be tied down to one spot from now until I die."
"&gt; How do I respond to this treatment

By walking away from this manipulative asshole. There's really no other way."
That‚Äôs...kind of everything. Everything is ‚Äúdecision making‚Äù when you‚Äôre an adult. He needs to take some of the load off you.
"That's his decision to make, though. You can warn him against it as much as you want but ultimately he's a grown man and he's going to make the choices he makes. You can't force someone not to do something stupid."
If you want a happy relationship break up with him? His behavior sounds controlling and shady. I'm not saying you need an open phone policy but to throw the phone away from you just so you don't see it? That's crazy.
"Because we socialise girls and women that way. I've got a 5 month old baby boy and even at that age his female peers get 'oh look how cute your outfit is!', 'aren't you just gorgeous' etc etc. If she grew up good looking she probably got it alllll the time. 

I'm proud of my academic achievements, I like to think I'm funny, kind, nice to be around etc, but I can't switch off the part of my brain that wants to be seen as pretty too cos it's pretty hammered in there by society ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"She‚Äôs fucking nuts, right? I felt insane typing this post out, but I *know* I‚Äôm not losing my mind. I know what this is."
I mean we are doing that.  Both of us have some different things we do or volunteer with.
I mean especially in this case but always. A wedding is something you have when you've built a life. IMO anyway.
"Some of your suggestions sound like a more passive reaction (when you stop responding, saying ""uh huh,"" trying to ignore her, wearing headphones). 

This would work on most people, but you have to be direct, and you have to firmly react with a ""no"" every time. Not passively, but a blatant, ""Jane, I'm working, and I'm not going to talk to you right now."" 

Repeat it every single time until she stops. 

Tell her if she wants your attention for work, she can email you, and then leave you alone until you respond. If she emails you and then taps your shoulder to ask if you read it, say, ""Jane, when I reply to you, you will know that I read it. Until then, please let me work."" Rinse and repeat.

I would also rope in your boss. You keep replying to comments, that you tried what the suggestion is already. Enough is enough. Tell your boss you have made all of these efforts."
"Your friend is being completely reasonable, and your boyfriend is being ridiculously childish. If you do this every 3 months or so, how does he still not have a single place he could hang out at for a few hours? Like he has no interests outside of you? He can‚Äôt go check out a board game store or a movie or a museum or literally anything??"
"You are in a relationship with someone who will not be supportive of you as you work on your anxiety issues. If that is what you need from your SO, then this isn't your guy."
"I don't think you can get around the fact of this being an ultimatum, nor the fact that it's completely valid and not unhealthy. People talk about ultimatums like they're Voldemort for relationships. Although they can absolutely be used manipulatively and abusively, they have an appropriate place."
"Call him out loudly when he does things like this (the kiss).  Loudly enough to bring others into the room.  He and they may say you're misinterpreting it but the more you keep calling him out, maybe he'll back off."
"&gt; Although I let her out with him

I don't know if this is a language thing, but you do not ""let"" your girlfriend do anything. She's a grown woman.

I'm wondering what makes you uncomfortable about this? I think you are overreacting to be jealous; this guy has a friendly business relationship with her and sees his daughter in her, so what is wrong with that? She's trying to maintain a good client rapport."
"First, tell your husband right now.

Second, it's not a joke. Your husband needs to do more then just ""have talks"" with him that clearly aren't working. Be clear with your husband that this man kissed you on your neck when you didn't want him too. That's not flirting, he's not just harassing a woman he knows isn't interested, he's molesting/assaulting you. Just like with the groping. This is not okay and you and husband need to stop letting it go and being quiet about it to avoid making waves.

First of all, you should never be alone with his brother EVER. If your husband is going to bring you around this creep, he needs to be there at all times to make sure you are touched. If that's not doable, he should tell his parents/whoever that his brother has continued to hit on you and touch you inappropriately and you don't feel comfortable at events with anymore.

If you don't follow this advice or if BIL is ever inappropriate with you again you need to shut it down HARD and ideally loud. If he gropes you or kisses you SCREAM. Scream ""HELP!"" at full volume. Run away from him. When other people ask what is wrong look super upset (if you can cry bonus points) and be like \[BIL's name\] was gropping me! Help,"" or ""\[BIL's name\] was kissing my neck! Help."" Make a giant fucking scene. Currently he gets away with this crap since you think it's on you to be quiet and tolerate his abuse. NOPE. He should be completely shamed and humiliated any time he tries.

Next time he makes a flirty comment, shut him down similarly hard, in front of everyone. If he says he'd like to come visit you when you are alone, don't say ""oh I'm busy"" or some excuse say ""No. I'm not comfortable alone with you after all the times you've groped me and last time you kissed my neck. Being alone with you scares me."" If he says it was a joke say ""That's awful. I'm so uncomfortable around you all the time from your years of harassment. Why would you torment me as a joke?"" And look like you might cry. Don't let him play it off. 

Also, no more hugs or kisses of ANY KIND for creeper. Have husband tell him he is never to touch you again, in any way, due to his history. And if he tries you are to back up and hold up your hands and say ""NO,"" very firmly. When he then makes it awkward, turn it back on him. ""Last time you kissed me you kissed my neck. It was really scary for me. I don't feel safe with you kissing me anymore. You've been told this. Stay the F back."" Or if he tries to hug you ""NO. You've gropped me and kissed my neck before. I don't feel safe with you touching me anymore. You've been told this. Stay away. I'm scared."" 

Ect."
"He was probably keeping her as a fall back. Don't be surprised if they start spending a LOT more time together, or even get back together. Don't let it bother you either, they seem to deserve each other and you deserve better."
"Amongst certain social groups, yes. But it's not universal.

Perhaps you are outgrowing your current crop of friends."
"Think about all the couples you know who've been happily together for 25 years or more.

How many of them have ever said to you, ""Well actually, when we first going out we broke up five times!""

None.  

Because that never happens.

I'm really sorry, this is a horrible situation, my heart goes out to you and your child.  But you need to move on."
They talked about it later and she doubled down.
"People who are confident in themselves don't obsessively seek out external validation. Your assessment thaf your gf has extremely low self esteem sounds accurate and I would guess too that maybe she feels that her looks are all people value. Because of this she's desperately trying to get confirmation that she's worthy from instagram followers (who probably include friends and sorority sisters and aren't all random strangers).

The way that you are looking at it tho - that you think she's cute - is still not addressing the problem that SHE doesn't think she's cute. Photoshopping your own pictures usually makes you feel extra shitty about how you really look too. 

She needs to find validation and build self esteem in areas that aren't about how she looks. If she has self esteem and confidence in other areas then how she looks won't be quite so important (not to say it won't be important, just there should be a reduction in how much so). 

As to how you address it with her - approach it as you are worried she's not happy in herself and want to support her in finding ways to build her overall confidence in herself and let her lead with what form this might take. Don't expect overnight results, our society is very image based so this 'programming' is hard to undo. Good luck!"
I‚Äôve just spent two weeks in Arizona (I‚Äôm from the UK) with my Mum. We celebrated her 78th birthday whilst there ‚ù§Ô∏è
EXACTLY.
"Your boyfriend is insecure and controlling and he's isolating you from your best friend. When you finally wake up to how your life is going into the crapper with this guy, you're going to end up with no one"
"Cleaning, especially of the kitchen, should be done daily - at a minimum, wiping up your spills and messes. There's no excuse to only do it once a week. When living with others, you have to be more conscientious than you would on your own."
If your ex is in her 30s and you got divorced 20 years ago... how old was she at the time?? 19 at most? It must‚Äôve been a pretty short marriage dude. All these strong emotions after so long by you and your current wife are truly odd.
"&gt; I asked if she thought she'd like to speak to an specialist, it could be useful and interesting to maybe decipher the dreams and know why they are so menacing so often.

I also experience vivid nightmares &amp; have for my entire life. I don‚Äôt think the dreams mean anything that needs to be ‚Äúdeciphered.‚Äù In my case, if I am stressed out in real life or if I watch specific things on television, then I get the nightmares. So while I think your concern is valid, I also think expressing it in terms of going to a therapist to learn what the dreams ‚Äúmean‚Äù may have been the issue. Maybe refocus on going to a sleep specialist instead of on analyzing the dreams with a therapist? I would also be annoyed if someone told me that I should go to a therapist to analyze my dreams, but I would hear that concern very differently if it was expressed around helping me to sleep better instead of decoding something about my psyche. 

Also, regarding the not wanting to talk about it, there are two possible explanations. One: the dreams have nothing to do with any real life trauma, but it‚Äôs embarrassing to your girlfriend that she is an adult person that still experiences nightmares, since they are commonly associated with young children. Two: the dreams do have something to do with a real life trauma that she‚Äôs not ready to discuss with you."
"You are going to leave your kitten for 17 days? A kitten is not a cat. You should have your kitten stay with someone. 

Your dad needs a reality check. You need to pay and quite frankly for such an unusual animal, $50 is not enough for 17 days. And that's with the kitten staying elsewhere."
"I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way. Please don‚Äôt leave your kids alone with adults who have showed you they don‚Äôt respect physical boundaries. There is never a way to tell whether someone is trustworthy with kids until something happens, so we have to use our guts and what we can, and what we *can* do is only leave them with particularly trustworthy and respectful adults."
"People tend to fall into patterns of abusive relationships, often because they grew up with abuse as part of a formative experience and also because they are overly empathetic (not a bad thing! Just easily taken advantage of by the wrong people). Please look into therapy for yourself when you get out so that you can get your sense of normal back on track and not fall into another situation like this. You deserve to be loved and respected."
"Support your fiance.

If your Dad says he won't come to the wedding, just let him do that.

I'm sorry you are going to have to pick sides in this, and I think you should pick your future wife."
"Not only is he cheating, HE SAID TO YOU THAT HE *LOVES* HER 

Derp!?!?


It's. 
Over."
"Writing an email or text can sometimes actually be easier for the grieving person so they don't feel like they have to force the ""appropriate"" response while you're watching. I've been on both sides of a similar situation, and I found this worked best for me, but only you know your situation fully! I just know that I appreciated the space to process my emotions before having to respond. It can be super confusing to be so happy for someone and their news while also finding it so painful.

And congratulations!!"
"Do yourself a favor, don‚Äôt get married for at least eight years."
"Sounds like you need to invite a different friend to take exes ticket, and let his friends know he broke up with you and won't be coming, haha.  You'll have 2 friends who can be a buffer between you and them."
"She sounds clingy. It sounds like her issue is viewed as something you should fix. Why can't she be alone? If she has trust issues, this will be a long term problem, where she's the one who has to do work, but you're the one who ends up giving in. Me-time is very important to stay a sane and balanced individual. Plato has a nice theory about longing for our other half, but it's necessary to grow and survive on our own. It doesn't necessarily mean that you merge into a siamese twin-construction."
"I actually hadn‚Äôt made a plan until my bf mentioned it. I guess hypothetically we‚Äôd have to get our neighbor (who is pet sitting my dad‚Äôs cats) to do it, however it‚Äôs a pretty long list of stuff (like dealing w live worms) and I barely know the guy, so I was kind of dreading bringing it up. Thankfully my boyfriend stepped up and offered to help out."
I know OP has already responded but I just want to say that this is a damn good answer.
"Uhhhh are you dating an 11 year old child? Honestly this is a huge red flag. Why is cleaning your job? And his childish silent treatment before playing video games is cruel to you, emotionally abusive. If you stay with him, this is a peek into the rest of your life together. Option 1: have an adult conversation with him about the responsibilities of sharing a space. If he agrees and starts doing his half of the work, that's one thing. Option 2: If he refuses or continues to stonewall you and treat you like a servant, I would get the hell outa there, girl. There are SO MANY kind, mature, emotionally available men out there who not only pull their weight in a relationship but also treat their partners with respect. 100% of the time."
Definitely see a lawyer BEFORE discussing divorce. The lawyer will help you plan.
"Yes! 
For some parents, they find it incredibly difficult to take advice from their children. My mum had to learn how to feed her dad information through other channels because he wouldn't consider her as anything other than his kid."
"Maybe talk to your dad individualy 

Maybe your dad forgets what normal dating is, your dad is only ""in touch"" with married life. Because that's only what he's known for the past few decades. 

Like you said, it'd be different if your boyfriend was the family's son in-law. 

Remind your dad of your guys ages, life-modes, and ask your dad what should happen to the ATV if you two go your separate ways before age 25."
"Bro, this sounds hella codependent. I work a third shift job that makes my husband and I have an incompatible sleep schedule (I really need to be in bed by 8:30 at the latest to grab a few hours before work) but I recognize that my husband is a fully formed human who needs his own life, so I don‚Äôt ask him to adjust my sleep schedule. I feel like she‚Äôs being really unreasonable with you."
"You didn‚Äôt tell your boyfriend that your friend was over because your boyfriend wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there that early and you didn‚Äôt expect him to be there that soon?  Wow, why not just admit you were cheating instead of fabricating this ridiculous load of shit?  He probably is ghosting you which is a very appropriate response to all this.  Good for him."
"You already tried that and she didn't go for it. She refused. That was the chance to get back together, and she didn't take that chance when she could have. Not many people get the opportunity for a second chance. She had her opportunity and turned it down. Let that be the end of it."
I'd be concerned that will only encourage them to have lengthy visits *in OP's home*.  I've read more than a few posts here where there was a large distance between DH and his family but he would cave and let them stay (not even asking for DW's input).  Then MIL would end up staying *months*.  At least now they're not under foot.
"&gt; but he thinks it's normal because it's our choice.

well he kinda have a point with that. he showed you what kind of asshole he is and you choose to stay with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Choose not to.

&amp;#x200B;

personal curiosity: he's 29 and his parents are supporting him??"
"Also, forgiveness doesn't and shouldn't mean you have to have any sort of relationship with the person. I've mostly moved past my anger at my own ex, but I absolutely do not under any circumstances want to see him again. Even if he changed completely as a person, that bridge has been burned and that is fine."
"I know. It sounds stupid because he literally threatened me and yet here I am, still in the relationship. Thank you for your response, it means a lot."
Nope.  You're good to be rid of him.
"Also unless a date was God awful or he was a terrible person, don‚Äôt be so harsh. Man I felt bad reading that, can‚Äôt imagine how hurt the guy would be"
"OP I just want to be frank with you: in the future please understand that relationships are not a court of law. It‚Äôs one thing to tell somebody you don‚Äôt want to be exclusive because you actually intend to sleep with/date other people. It‚Äôs another thing to imply emotional commitment and exclusivity then sleep with someone else and assume you‚Äôll be forgiven because the word ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù never came up.

Furthermore, you are never going to negate someone‚Äôs emotional response by arguing that it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútechnically cheating‚Äù. You betrayed his trust and expectations and it‚Äôs going to hurt when you do that to people. 

On the other hand, your description of this guy says that he has very unhealthy levels of jealousy and possessiveness. This is not someone you should be in a relationship with, at all. I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs really worth it for you to go into everything that happened with the other guy when what you should be doing is exiting this relationship.

You can‚Äôt have a healthy relationship with somebody who has distrusted you from the start‚ÄîWhich is what this guy was doing every time he got upset with you for having male friends or was looking over your shoulder when you text.

If you think there‚Äôs a chance that he‚Äôll go off the rails if you mention breaking up with him, do it through text. Tell him you‚Äôre sorry but you‚Äôre not as comfortable with this relationship as you need to be to take things further."
TOLD YOU to clean? Foh lmao
"You didn't break up with him over their close relationship, at least I hope not. You broke up with him over continued lies and disrespect for your feelings."
He's guilt tripping you. Like seriously. You guys seem really co-dependent.
"Hey, if you're looking to give a hard truth (per your username) you'll want to focus on making sure it's intelligible, and then back it up with facts. Right now, this is more of a 'meanopinion2019'."
"&gt;I haven't really brought up the concern of coming in second to his parents and sister because he gets very, very defensive about his family

Well there's your answer.  Your wants, needs and preferences will *always* come second to his family.  He has very clearly told you that.  Ignoring this or hoping it will change is a lost cause.  He has told you in words that his family will always come first.  Are you ok with that ?  If not, then break up with him and move wherever you want.

You two are incompatible.  And it's a huge red flag for someone to be so defensive about their family and to *insist* that their family comes first.  That's a massive, waving red flag that his family will control everything about your lives if you stay with him.  Can you imagine how much they will control if you stayed in the area and had kids ?  üò±

Bail.  And be thankful you didn't spend more time in this relationship where his priorities are clearly not you."
"Dated a guy like that. It just got worse over time, over such little things. 

I agree with the prior comments.

Stop dating a jerk honey!"
"Don‚Äôt forget there‚Äôs also the possibility that you already have it anyhow - it doesn‚Äôt always present symptoms in everyone, and can lay dormant, or breakouts can also be so insignificant that you don‚Äôt notice.

Anyway, as people have said, you‚Äôre entitled to end a relationship for any reason you want! Plenty of people have HSV1 or 2, and still have partners who don‚Äôt. if you feel like you‚Äôre making a mistake then follow your gut."
"Are you looking for sympathy here? Because I have none for you. Your post is littered with pleas for understanding. One of the first things we learn as children is ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have anything nice to say, then don‚Äôt say anything at all‚Äù. You are getting what you deserve and I don‚Äôt blame him for breaking it off. How could he ever go in with you and trust that you weren‚Äôt saying cruel things behind his back. Because that‚Äôs what they were cruel things. Nice people don‚Äôt just randomly say cruel things out of the blue. This is a HUGE red flag and he is right to bail. His confidence is probably shattered. This is good that it is causing you so much hurt because now you might learn from this and never be a petty cruel person towards anyone ever again."
"It's absolutely insecurity. This gave me a shuddering flashback to my ex who gave me hell one night I wanted to go meet my best friend and he didn't want to go, and I stayed out half an hour later than I'd intended and got ripped apart because I'd left him ""lonely."" I was like you are a grown man and I thought you were asleep!! If you seriously cannot sleep on your own, that's a you problem that you need to address."
That‚Äôs a bullshit statistic. And what are you recommending then? DONT talk to your partner??
"Dude.  You  suck.....a lot.  Do you know how hard it is to be a mom?  And go to school and work PT?  She never gets alone time.  She is constantly at this little persons beck and call.  She is putting her needs aside all the time.  Help her. Maybe when you come home from work, take your daughter to the park, so your wife can get a moment of peace.  Maybe take her out to dinner just the two of you.  Stop being selfish and help your wife."
"OP, I think this is great, although I'd add one thing: Hand-deliver them for sure, but when you do OP, say something like, ""Your conversation with me about forgiving my ex-boyfriend is over. If you'd like to continue it, continue it with this gift. If you can prove to me that you read it cover to cover, then I will be open to continuing the conversation with you again. Unless that happens, I fully expect you to demonstrate that you do care about me by *respecting my wishes and not bringing this up with me ever again.*"" End it with a warning about ""If you do bring it up again, I'll do [XYZ thing]"" or something. You decide what that is, what you're comfortable effectively threatening them with, and then if anyone fucks around, follow through."
"I know! The only reason I joined was for the GI bill, I couldn‚Äôt imagine giving that away. Not even to my kids. I‚Äôm using is 100%"
"Damn, you nailed her personality on the dot! That‚Äôs EXACTLY how she comes across! And that‚Äôs ironic lol I don‚Äôt know if she has any step-siblings though, but I know she has sisters. Is your step-sis a combat medic?"
"You *must* inform cadre. You can request to be counseled and then in the counseling tell them your concerns. You should do this all as discreetly as possible. You can tell them that at the very least you want a memorandum of record documenting what happened. Hazing and bullying, retaliation, assault, etc. are absolutely not tolerated in the Army.  You have no proof who did it so I would just say 'someone who has access to my room destroyed my things and if I had not been aware it could have resulted in chemical burns to my face and hands'.

&amp;#x200B;

From now on if you have a locker or a locked closet you need to secure your stuff. ALL OF IT. That means you put away your toothpaste/brush, shampoo, your uniform, your pens, your CAC. You eliminate the opportunity for anyone to do this to you again. I'm sure they are enjoying watching you squirm and be mental about it so don't discuss it. Don't let them see if it bothers you. Just be cool as a cucumber. I wouldn't discuss this with anyone except the chain of command. Just calmly handle this like an adult. Put your stuff away. Communicate with your chain of command. And let them handle it. Support their decisions and move on. Good luck."
"...and then punish her for not performing them properly.

I had a friend like this. Seemed to invite me places and to do things specifically for the purpose of turning her nose up at me."
"Of that doesnt work then I would try reaching out to him to let him know ""Hey my mom has a bit of an unhealthy obsession with you and thinks you work at [location she wants to go]. I've tried to dissuade her from doing so but it doesn't seem to work."" He may get a million messages but at least you can give him a heads up."
Please move out.  Yesterday.  Ask your boss for an advance - tell him the situation - and take a bus to Maine.  I'm so sorry.
"Then you need to ask yourself why that's acceptable behavior from him. Your best friend is asking for something simple, just a couple hours alone to talk with you, and he won't give it to you."
"You absolutely should not fess up.  What you did was brave and commendable.  It sounds like the staff was not taking the bullying situation seriously, and now they have egg on their faces.

You did a lot more due diligence than most people would have.  

&gt;Sandy and Rachel got suspended after the school went asking questions to everyone who was supposedly involved, and most everyone backed up what the email had said. And the cops also got involved, since some of the stuff I wrote about in the email happened at a massive house party at Sandy's mom's house, and so she's in trouble for hosting a party with underage kids drinking and even driving

This is 100% not your fault.  Sandy's mom made a choice to be a cool mom rather than a responsible mom, and she is going to have to deal with the consequences.  That is part of being an adult.

If you fess up, you just open yourself up to attacks, further bullying, and litigation (don't worry about that unless you are served a complaint).  Sunlight is the best disinfectant and sounds like the school would rather hide in the shade."
"You‚Äôve got to fix your insecurities. Were you one of those unattractive insecure types who transformed themselves to be hot and now passes judgment on others for those same insecurities? If so, you didn‚Äôt really fix your insecurities by becoming hot, you just painted them over."
"Just wish I could give you a hug. You know what your seeing and feeling. It‚Äôs hard to write it and it‚Äôs just as hard to face it. 

All relationships definitely don‚Äôt get to this point, not even close. Sometimes we just pick the wrong one. How much longer until your nursing stuff is done?"
"He‚Äôs extremely hurt. You need to give him space to process. Tell him you understand why he‚Äôs hurt but you would love a chance to explain if he can see giving you that. 
He might not be able to move past it."
"Not only is it not forgivable within the relationship, but it will probably haunt him in future relationships and nag at him every time he goes on a date."
"&gt;""Your actions are speaking so loudly I can't hear your intentions"". 

I LOVE that phrase."
I think that the OP also has to assume that he doesn't 'love threesomes' he loves fucking people who aren't her so there is a good chance that these will become twosomes.
"Rehoming is not throwing away. I think if your lifestyle is no longer suitable to care for a pet, that pet deserves to be in a home where it will get the love and attention it needs.

It's a sad reality, but many households find that giving their pet the care they deserve is no longer possible once they add a tiny human to the family. Yes, there are other options. Some handle those options well, others don't. OP and his wife don't seem like they're doing so well as it is."
"I think redirecting the need for validation from strangers to her boyfriend is not any better, to be honest. What she needs to practice is internal validation. Instead of framing it as wanting to impress him instead, I think he should frame it as her having worth without needing to prove it to anyone."
"Do not let her move in with you. She will bring your brother. Neither of these oeople are good for your son or your marriage. Find assisted living, check into visiting nurses, and call afult social services to find out more options. You are not the only person in this type of situation. As for her pets, have her call a pet sitter or get in touch with the shelter to see if they have a volunteer available. Contrary to popular opinion, it is not your job to take care of an abusive parent who will bring a violent drug addict into your home."
"Yeah, my husband and I agree that our first time was just not good. I was prepared for the worst after that. But we kept dating and, well, I did agree to marry the guy! If you like him, I wouldn't call it a dealbreaker just yet. The first time is not at all an accurate assessment in my opinion."
Work hours don‚Äôt matter. He still lives there 100% of the time. He‚Äôs an adult. He can take care of his share.
"Touche.  
   
Just like how in real life you hopefully wouldn't make a point to show up at an acquaintance's house because you figured out their address, you wouldn't do that to a YouTube vlogger. In fact, it's even creepier, because your relationship with them is entirely one-sided. They don't know you."
"That... how... why aren't you allowed to hang out with other males?! Or girls, that *he has not approved*, because that is what that is? Are there non-controlling answers to that? 


Because to me that is controlling."
This sounds perfect to me. Just say exactly that and don‚Äôt say anything else and just walk away.
"Your friends need hobbies. They also sound like the type of people who ""peak"", and will spend their next few decades wishing they were still in their twenties. Everyone drinks. Everyone fucks. Life goes on. Not everyone has interesting hobbies. They need those. Seriously, talking at length about sex is like bragging about breathing. They need lives."
We shall use my larger scales!
"No we‚Äôd been dating before the world knew she existed, now she‚Äôs a huge pop singer and he knows about her and I casually brought up early on her career how I went to school with her and we were school friends and ever since then he hasn‚Äôt dropped it"
"The old him wasn‚Äôt really him, though. The boy who cheated on you is who he is, and you deserve more than that.

Take the time to cry about it, because of course it hurts. But then take some time to discover yourself more. Get back into old hobbies. Find some new interests. Call up a friend. Go on a walk.

Every day, slowly but surely, it will stop feeling like you can‚Äôt breathe and that the hurt won‚Äôt go away. Every day, it will get a little bit better."
"At least give him $75-100, dude.  17 days is a rather long time.  He'd be working for less than three dollars a day!  Would that even cover his gas usage?  Don't take advantage of his generosity."
"&gt;Unless her parents are selling her to a wicked Duke

Thanks for the fanfic idea ;-)

And agreed, friend sounds both dramatic and insanely passive-aggressive."
"Is the neighbor getting paid? I'm going to guess no, since it's pretty ridiculous to think your dad would be okay with paying someone who only has to walk next door but balks at reimbursing someone who's going to have a 40 minute round trip commute. Your dad is being unreasonable. I wonder if creating an outline of the amount of time your boyfriend is going to put into the job, the number of miles he'll be driving (current IRS reimbursement for mileage is 58 cents per mile) and maybe your state's minimum wage etc, then presenting it to your dad, would help?"
"If you only told HR about the asking out part, I can see why they gave you that response, but if you included the touching and cornering, that's a massive fail on their part. 

Either way, this guy needs to be told a very hard no as suggested elsewhere. I don't think you need to give any reason why."
"Divorce him.

He's not taking it seriously because you're not following through.

And frankly, you should. What a dirtbag move."
"Truth. 

- from someone who ultimately divorced a Mama's boy because after almost 10 years, things never got better."
"You can not do anything to help her. All the emotional toil that you are putting in is not paying dividends. Frankly, the fact that she will put the wife of a former coworker in front of her friend suggests an obliviousness that is extremely unhealthy. Sadly, there is little that you can do to change this. 

Although it is horrible to suggest, I would consider removing support from her when **this particular type of situation** blows up in here face. Just a 'sorry to hear that' and 'how about that local sports team'."
"He invited me and suggested it. Not sure what you mean haha

Yeah.. And it is not the only thing I am bothered with, there are more things,but not related to this post

I actually have considered breaking up, I just felt like I was too sensitive maybe. I thought other relationships were similar, I needed a second opinion on Reddit :/"
He he he vagillion okay sorry bye
"Now you know who you're not safe getting drunk with, find better friends"
"After a divorce the military will move you back to your home of record i thought. Maybe thats just if you‚Äôre overseas though, because its definitely the case where i am now."
"Ask yourself if you would move to that city for your own career. You said you're not happy where you are, so it could be a fine opportunity.

Fully look into job openings and cost of living etc. Look at apartments for rent/sublet. Could you make it work with a different roommate if the two of you didn't work out?

If you find a great job and the housing market won't leave you feeling trapped, maybe give it a go.

Make sure he can afford the rent by himself, make sure you could afford rent by yourself.
Don't comingle finances or debt.


I personally would take a chance if I were already wanting a fresh start somewhere else.


Long distance with an end time in mind isn't so bad if that is what you are most comfortable with."
"It would be prudent to keep your opinion on the situation to yourself. Be kind to the ex, and definitely do not get sucked into drama. 

But, if your friend asks, feel free to let him know how you view the situation."
"Wow, you‚Äôre incredibly unreasonable"
"Maybe not creepier, but it is a lot more personal. IG models are way more likely to respond to DMs and chat with fans. I‚Äôm much more comfortable with actual porn than this."
"She can't have kids because of a medical reason with her ovaries/uterus so they don't have kids, thank god. 

I suggested couple's counseling and individual therapy for the two of them but they won't go. Both are being extremely bull-headed. It's a sad situation."
"If she's having two week periods it could absolutely explain why she is sexually, physically and emotionally distant. If her diet is off/sleep...etc, that also has a lot to do with weird cycles. It could signify a major hormone imbalance (could be anything from endometriosis, birth control, to pre-menopause, etc). 
She should see a doctor rather than have both of you suffer through the symptoms.

I want to stress that this might not even be a therapy/relationship issue, might just be an actual biological issue that getting between you two and should definitely be discussed/taken to consideration."
"No way, no alimony from a military paycheck. Jesus, let her move back with her parents. He's taken plenty of hits for her."
How is suggesting she examine her actions judgmental? She herself admits how wrong and superficial she was to say those things.
"I am not assuming anything, she said it in the post, he plays games all weekend. She also said in the post, she stands all day for work...even if it was part time. That shit is tiring as hell. and i definitely will not be picking after some man child who thinks because he works full time he doesn't have to lift a finger. Thank God you clean up after yourself. That is what a sensible adult is suppose to do. Not shout and hound your girlfriend to clean up after you."
"As unsettling as it is, it seems mom is treading on stalker territory. This is not healthy at all like OP is downplaying. If she shows up and this youtuber rejects her or freaks out (he will), I have a feeling she wont handle the rejection well. Slipping into a depression or going full on stalker. This is scary behavior that is no doubt going to escalate, especially if she goes through with her ""plan""."
"Life, uh, finds a way. Congrats to you both! C:"
"Or you can wait like, forever because it's not her problem. I'd never tell someone my friends told me to dump them, whether I wanted to break up with them or not.

Maybe you say the friend doesn't really like them so they don't have to awkwardly interact but yikes"
"This happened outside of work and isn‚Äôt an HR issue. Yet. But keep the texts and if he continues to pursue you and therefore make you uncomfortable AT work, then take it to HR. In the meantime document everything. He can‚Äôt spin the story much if you have it written down.

I‚Äôm guessing though, if he took PTO after you very clearly set him straight, that he‚Äôs sulking/embarrassed and will lay low until any awkwardness passes. Good luck."
"I started reading your schedule and stopped because it was so ridiculous. Why does she care if you stay awake after her? She'll be sleeping either way. You already know her demands are unreasonable, and you're right. They are unhealthy, and if one of you is dismissing the other's feelings, it's her."
"Unless OP's family are really nasty, it might be an idea to run back and go ""you were right about him"". But you know, if a family is worried that their daughter is dating a scummy person, cutting her off seems very. Contradictory."
Yeah but do you randomly bring up when people platonically slept in the same bed lol
I think the military will actually buy her one!
"I've been there to an extent. I think it's honestly pretty common in your 20s. A lot of things change, friendships fade out, job changes, moving etc. just a lot of old things that go away. 

It can be sad but there can also be lots of new beginnings. I'm not qualified to give any advice on the sexual part except to maybe consider therapy because it sounds to me like you have a very low self esteem which is kinda causing some issues for you. 

As for the general loneliness, have you been trying to meet people and make new friends? I feel like a lot of your lonely and sad feelings might stem from your past which again therapy can help with. But yeah you just kinda need to get out there and meet people. Some will annoy you a lot and with others you won't feel any connection but eventually someone sticks around and then you meet their other friends etc and before you know it you got a group going on.

What kinda things do you enjoy doing, what are you interested in?"
"&gt;I went to Colorado with her like a year ago without him and I've hung out with her once alone and after that he wasnt happy

His reaction to you spending time with your friend is over the top. It is unhealthy. It is healthy to spend time separately with your friends. 

Your boyfriend seems to think he's missing out on the party, when in reality your best friend needs your ear and advice to talk out her issues.

The workaround is that you establish boundaries. ""Ok boyfriend, I need to spend a couple hours with best friend so that we can speak freely and then you can come over so that we all can hang out."""
Agree.  He sounds like a creep.
"I don‚Äôt know much about all of this - but know that for many of my friends, the only ‚Äúwinners‚Äù are the divorce attorneys who have full access to your financial situation. I have heard that mediation can be a much more civil, lower-cost alternative to divorce attorneys."
"&gt;he doesn‚Äôt know the place well enough 

Frankly, that‚Äôs really embarrassing and childish for a 21-year-old.

Has he never been on vacation in a different city?  It sounds from what you‚Äôve written that he‚Äôs completely incapable of taking care of himself (and to an extent, you are too).  This is super, super unhealthy."
You're entitled to your dealbreakers. A LOT of people have either HSV 1 or 2 so just be prepared if it is a dealbreaker.
"&gt; I know your mum is not trying to harm him

I wouldn't be so sure of this.

Imagine if the tables were flipped and it were a young female youtuber and a nearly 60-year old man who has spent every waking hour for 3 months combing through her social media and now plans to show up to her work to give her a gift and won't listen to reason.

This is a stalker. OP's mother is a stalker."
Break up with him you need to control your own money
"To me just save up and move out. He already knows what to do, anyone that sees their house in a mess and decides not to clean just doesn't want to. Stop picking up his slack, he is an adult."
"The thing is, even if Kate did a bunch of bad stuff...he asked her to marry him, then turned around and cheated on her. That's not something a person with character does."
"I swear there was a post like two months back with a very similar problem and a very similar sounding post. I don't know if this is a repost or just a coincidentally similar post..

Anyway, everyone knows it's difficult to make friends as adults. Sounds like on paper you guys are doing all the right things but I think your attitude also needs some adjusting.

The fact of life is, when it comes to friends, life does not owe you any. You make some as a kid  and as teen and as a young adult and hopefully you grow up on similar paths, or hopefully you keep making more friends so that the ones that naturally fall by the wayside get replaced by more compatible friends. But you also need to really make an effort in some ways, and understand that there is no perfect friendship. Some will be slightly imbalanced, some you just won't see as often as you'd like, others will be fine but have a quirk that annoys you once in a while.

Also please don't think you have to exclude yourselves from your child having friends ' lives. They still wanna hang out, even if you guys are no longer a priority. That's pretty normal in a family situation. That doesn't mean they now dislike you. It just means their kid comes first.

If you guys act offended that you are not a priority then your friends will only exclude you more."
"Just a reminder to get tested before you sleep with anyone else.  I'm not saying she was cheating on you, but it really sounds like she met someone else."
"Ask her if that YouTuber has a PO box or some other kind of address that fans can send stuff to. If he's got one, she should use it. If not, it's never appropriate to visit someone at their home or office the address of which they never disclosed explicitly in public. Ask her how she'd feel if someone she didn't know or had only met once turned up to her house with an unwanted gift."
"Gosh that's mature for high school!

Wish more teenagers were like that."
"50 bucks for 17 days of pet sitting, plant watering, and shit cleaning? Are you kidding? Boyfriend or not, that is hilariously cheap. Top it off with with 40 minutes of driving for each visit and it's not exactly normal pet sitting either, he's got to wash worms and turkey baster mashed shit out of an aquarium? This not a simple pop in and check on them pet sitting job. This is a legit chore for nearly 3 weeks. And she wants to give him 3 bucks a day."
"Narcs do not change, they only move on to greener pastures once they have eaten your soul."
"You're married to a deadbeat man-child.
He's taken a backseat in the relationship and let you do all the work. He claims that he wants to change, but his actions do not match these words. He wants you to be his mom and support him. He's not in for an equal relationship."
"&gt; I do worry that my controlling nature is enabling and that I am spiraling into only looking for the bad. Maybe I am a narcissist that has ridiculous expectations. 

Oh, *sweetheart,* where is your self-esteem?"
"When people mock how shitty /r/relationships can be, we need to remember comments like this one. I seriously wish I was hearing someone talking to me like this in my teens and early twenties instead of religious puritan garbage."
"My partners father is currently in town for about a month. He (the father) lives abroad and my BF only gets to see him every 8 months or year. We are both in our early 20's and his father is only mid 40's... But when his father is in town I give them space to be together. They mean a lot to each other and I love hearing about the good times they have. Since his father is around for a month at a time we do make a couple dinner plans where we all meetup. But outside of that I really let them do their own thing. 

When you have a good relationship with a parent it is always a good thing and something that doesn't have to be shared. Not to mention for your trip... The cost of bringing your boyfriend along would be a bit much to expect of your father!"
"The comment you're replying to here is exceptional advice and a great script. You're totally entitled to have boundaries and you made them very clear at the beginning. 

You chose to be clear and respectful. He chose to lie to your face. I'm so sorry, and I hope you're able to get yourself out and clear as smoothly as possible."
Hahaha fuck yes! I‚Äôm buying a new one and hiding it!
"We had tried couples counseling about 3 years before the split; we went till our benefits ran out; then he lost his income for about nine months. 

Seeing as one of the big issues I brought up in counseling was his willingness to sacrifice our economic and emotional well-being for that of his toxic family, and after we were finally back on our feet again he moved his entire family into our home with no set end-date, I didn‚Äôt see counseling as that helpful for us."
"Once you walk through that fear and get to the other side you‚Äôll find that it wasn‚Äôt as scary as you thought it would be.

You can do this. You can and you will and you will heal from it faster than you can imagine. 

I called off my wedding two summers ago to a man I loved who was not treating his mental health, had explosive anger outbursts in traffic and so on like you described, and bonus was an alcoholic. Three months from the wedding and I left. 

That was the scariest, hardest thing I‚Äôd ever done. But that first night staying at my brother‚Äôs apartment, as much as I‚Äôd cried and as sad as I felt, I also felt like I could take on the world. That now the hardest thing was over, I‚Äôd done it, and now my future was in my own hands again and I could do *anything* I wanted with it.

You can leave, OP. It‚Äôll suck but I suspect you‚Äôll also feel the overwhelming relief that I did once it‚Äôs over. Be brave‚Äîyou are capable and resilient and you have so much joy and love ahead of you yet."
"Sex is not tasty, it's basically licking sweat. But if you are horny you really for give a f*ck about anything. If you aren't into it, all the ""unpleasant"" sensations will kick in and be the focus of the attention when the reality is that your mind and body are simply rejecting the interaction.


FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:

1. Before giving oral sex, put some saliva in your hand and massage the genital first. It will wash away any sweat or other fluids and it will make it way easier, specially if the other person hasn't taken a shower right away (which is normal).

* You can also try flavored lube, which is just amazing for both parties.

2. Genital fluid usually tastes stronger at first, since it's mixed with old fluid. New fluid (the kind of fluid that comes out during arousal) it's almost like water. So if something doesn't taste ""good"" at the beginning, it doesn't mean it's gonna be like that all the time. Hence the first point of using saliva / lube at the beginning.



Just don't do this if you don't feel like it. Also your girlfriend wasn't really nice by sending you to the shower. Orgasms aren't nearly as important as taking care of your sexual partner."
"I gotta say, I find it really strange that in the space of two months, you've ""fallen in love"" with someone *and* forgotten that you said a bunch of mean things about them."
"Your friend should totally pay... but might not. And if she doesn‚Äôt you don‚Äôt really have any legal recourse.

It would probably end the friendship if it was me"
"Mediation can suck if one of the partners is just there to waste time and money. Don't forget neither that the more time in mediation, the more money lawyers make. Besides, mediation will be as civil as the parties are willing to be.

I guess it depends where you are located, and if it's a divorce lawyer or another party doing the mediation."
"

&gt; Deep down, he's a good kid, but he's rude, inconsiderate of others, and seriously socially unaware. 

Honestly given everything you've described....no, he's not.  He sounds like an asshole.  It's totally possible for a disabled person to also be shitty.  

It's not your responsibility to make this kid a better person.  If his parents aren't even making progress, they need to consult a professional to address his behavior."
"Old married lady who's had kids here, and this was my take, too.

What jumped out at me:
1. Change happened after childbirth.
2. Excessively long periods.
3. Libido overly aligned with cycle.

Your wife needs to see both her gynecologist and primary, not for the sake of your sex life, but for her own health. In addition to the above mentioned conditions, polyps (and a couple cancers) leap to mind.

It also wouldn't hurt to get a blood test to see if she's anemic, because that can mimic depression, as well as screening for depression itself.

Normally I'm a full on cheerleader for couples counseling, which may still be called for. I would strongly urge you to look past your own, completely legitimate, desire for intimacy for a while, and help your wife get medical attention."
"Look, go through the appropriate legal channels and get this sorted. You say it's his, he doesn't have a damn clue and insisting on checking paternity first is the right move. This isn't about what you say is correct or not, this is about establishing the facts legally and properly."
What happened to make your self esteem so low? If you loved yourself you would have divorced.
"Short anger: you can't trust him, and you would be dumb as hell if you did.

Im not sure why people want to stay with terrible partners, and spend years of their lives trying, and almost certainly failing, to ""fix"" them.

Just find someone who is already decent."
"&gt; Give it a good year?

A *year* spent begging your partner to contribute to the household responsibilities, while he complains to his mother that you aren‚Äôt a homemaker and she in turn criticizes you for it?

That sounds like a hellish nightmare.

No one should be expected to teach their partner how to be an adult, how to contribute to a relationship, or how to not be a complete momma‚Äôs boy. If OP is this unhappy now, it‚Äôs absurd to suggest she stick with it another *year* in the hopes that he‚Äôll actually change."
She might just have to feel the deep embarrassment of this not going well.
"You sound so emotionally mature and it was a super difficult position to be in, but it really sounds like you were able to make the best decisions for yourself over and over again. You totally deserve someone who is able to be as mature about their feelings as you are, and I hope you find that soon."
"just a normal 50 year old wanting to party with a bunch of 25 year olds, normal stuff"
"But he didn't put thought and love into it. He didn't listen to what she said she wanted, he just did what he wanted. That's thoughtless, in my opinion.  
  
If I say that I would like a blue shirt and then my SO searches high and low for the most amazing yellow shirt, puts so much effort into getting this shirt for me, and says it's special because it was picked out just for me, I'd still be sad because I wouldn't feel heard at all. I hate yellow!"
Sounds like both of you have some serious issues to work out.
"Isn't there a lawyer on your post that deals with divorces? Start there.

There's nothing to salvage here, but you can do it as amicably as possible."
"You done good, good riddance to bad rubbish and all that. If you love your partner you don't call them anything like the things he called you, ever."
"You should be aware that your bf is emotionally abusing you. Here are the red flags I noticed:

1. Getting angry about struggling with money. It's perfectly reasonable to become stressed out or anxious about money. But your specific wording of 'angry' is a bad sign. 

2. The not speaking to you is pretty clear emotional abuse. It's called the silent treatment and it is not okay. 

3. Not letting you kiss him on the cheek- withdrawing of physical affection in order to punish the other partner is emotional abuse.

3. Days of him ignoring you? Shouting matches? Yikes. 

Why are you with this guy? He sounds awful if all he does is either ignore you, yell at you, or sit around and play video games."
"You don't have to pay for rent and groceries on your own.

You've mentioned your grandpa helping you already. You've got a sister that sounds concerned.

Guaranteed you have friends and family that love you and that would help you in a heartbeat. Heck, you probably don't even need to give them the full story yet if that sounds scary to do. Just a ""I can't be with him anymore"" would suffice, I'm sure."
"Have a sex and communication check in. Sit down with the intention of discussing first what works and is good about your sex life and communication. Agree first to ground rules like one person talks, no interruptions, use ""I feel"" statements. Then open it up for discussion around what is a challenge. If this starts to gets heated take a five minute recharge break. Then for each challenge decide on a new strategy to try. It's important that they're new strategies since whatever you're currently doing isn't resolving the issue. Take notes so you're forced to speak directly and get onto the same page. Agree to check in every week together on this topic to see how you're doing and to check in on strategies. Give new strategies at least three weeks before giving up on them. 


If this doesn't help, get a counselor to help facilitate."
"Also, his absolute refusal to compromise on *any* part of this is a quality I guarantee is not restricted to this particular argument. Almost always in these posts, the OP insists that their partner truly is perfect in every other way, but almost nobody is ONLY selfish and coercive when it comes to a singular situation. I would bet money that if she gave us some further insight into the relationship dynamics, we'd see this disregard for her feelings crop up many more times."
"This! I never particularly like my friends' boyfriends, prefer not to spend time with them and get very sick of them being brought along when I only want to hang out with the friend. 

She has to compromise and tolerate him sometimes, sure, but you definitely sound like you want to bring him every time, and he's not helping by complaining about being ""left out"". He's not this girl's friend: he can't expect her to want him there all the time. 

Friendship is give and take, OP. You see your boyfriend constantly, and your best friend only every now and then. Try to be more understanding of the fact that she wants to spend what limited time she gets with you *with you*, not your BF, and leave him at home when you see her. 

Does he know anyone in that area that he could make other plans with? Would he suck up a lazy day at home while you go see your buddy?"
"Gut wrenching to read that. No amount of excuses can make up for what he did, especially lying about condom use and then engaging in sexual acts with you, knowing full well it was putting you at risk.  You deserve better than that, and I truly hope wherever this leads, you can find happiness. Whether that be in someone who is mature enough to understand married life and treat you the way you deserve to be treated, or by finding peace within yourself and living a happy life as you, without needing someone else.  Keep your chin up, own any mistakes you think you may have made as well, and keep your eyes forward and on the future. You got this OP."
"Before we got into a relationship, my sex drive was so high and amazing. After dating him, it hit rock bottom and feels non existent. I never knew that could be a factor, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was."
"Prostitutes tend to insist on condoms as it concerns their health as well. However, you should still get an STI-test. This guy has a history of dishonesty, maybe there are partners you haven't found out about. Get yourself tested."
"&gt; He‚Äôs the type to bend over backwards for a partner

Before I read that I knew it to be true. He's just projecting his reality onto yours. I don't think you should put too much stock into it. He would do it for his partner, and refuse the money. He wouldn't be ""wrong"" to do that either. His love language is probably acts of service. So, that's just where he's coming from. Not everyone shows love the same way. Don't write him off as a silly old man, if he ever needs to talk to you about something important. But, on this issue, he's just projecting. Don't make a fuss about right vs wrong."
"These are your pets, not your dad's, right? I'm confused about why you seem to be hoping your dad would pay your boyfriend. Do you pay for the pets' food, tank, vet visits?"
"Theres is a saying in spanish that says ""entre broma y broma la verdad se asoma"" (between joke and joke, the truth comes out)"
"Say ""yep, no boys allowed!! Sorry, babe. But, here's a list of things you can do for the next couple hours. Come over in 2 hours""."
"Your ex admitted that work was his number one priority. You have incompatible libidos. And even in wanting you back, he doesn't seem committed to actual change, he just wants a return to the life he's gotten used to. I would just let him go and free you both up to find people with whom you are both better matched."
"I'm confused. If she was a nutcase who thinks two particles of dust is an unacceptable pigsty and is working five hours a week while he works sixty, that actually still would not remotely justify his behavior. What missing details could possibly make it so that OP deserves to be treated like a servant in her own home? If her boyfriend was really being so reasonable, he would have brought up his concerns in a reasonable, adult way, for example by saying to OP ""hey, it seems like the house is getting neglected a bit, I feel that I have been doing my fair share, can we talk about what needs doing and figure out where we're not on the same page?"""
My friends aren‚Äôt like that. Get some nerdy people as friends. They‚Äôll talk about games and dnd and shit.
I read a lil bit. She's a dependa. Run
"$20 says this girl goes on  to say things like, ‚ÄúBut this is my wedding YEAR!‚Äù 

Congrats, Neo, you dodged a bullet."
"If you are done, you just tell him. If you want to work on it, marital counseling. If its sudden with the weight gain and disinterest maybe he needs a good therapist himself. People grow apart. Marriage is hard. I'm in a similar situation with martial discourse. Not sure how I'm going to handle it either but all our cards are out in the open right now."
"This has to be a very strict religious setting for this to happen. Why don't they go to therapy? Why is he ashamed of masturbation?

This is so sad and their are so many layers."
I‚Äôve been in this situation too. I told her. She understood. I‚Äôm still with my now fianc√© for almost five years later.
"It wasn't bashing you, it was telling you a hard truth. Part of growing up is finding your own way and learning who you are as an individual. You both need to do that, because clearly you haven't yet."
"Children would rather live in a one bedroom apartment in a quiet safe environment with a Mom who deeply loves them than in a house full of toxic chaos . You are stronger than you know. Make a plan, and get out."
"Left my ex just before we turned 40.  Married him at 19.  Realized I gave up my 20s &amp; 30s to someone I'm not compatible with (in many ways).

Don't do that, OP.  Bail now, before kids.  My 2 kids are the best thing to come out of it, I'd love for it all to be different, but to have them, too.

I work for a company where I talk to the military and their families all day long.  I often thank them and their spouses for their service. 

She's not serving.  She doesn't deserve the thanks."
This is what I was going to say. Yes some people have the privileged to do that for themselves. But it comes across as condescending to think that everyone has the luxury to be able to afford that type of arrangement. Not everyone needs to live by themselves to gain independence.
"I see.

He needs therapy to help him adjust to the concept of ""adult"", perhaps."
It does when the person doing it is also professing romantic feelings and asking for dates. Quit being obtuse.
"Excellent Jeff Foxworthy reference. And, sadly, correct."
"If he doesn't have a job, maybe he should spending that time away looking for one? He should be paying his part of the trip, it's not fair to you. Setting up an alone time with your friend, like a trip for just you two would be good if you want to keep that friendship. She's friends with you, not your boyfriend. She's probably wants to talk inhibited with you and hang out with YOU and  without feeling like she's playing third wheel to y'all ."
"Have you told her point blank that she's entering stalker territory? Maybe that'll shock her out of it. She's overstepping boundaries, celecrities of any kind are not public property. And good intentions or not, if every follower did this, it'd still mean the youtuber would be approached by strangers all the time.

I think it's also worth talking to her about the possible risks to the his job, she probably won't want him to get in trouble at work. And if she really, really wants to give him that gift: sending it to some kind of fanmail address would be the appropriate way to do it."
"17 days is a long time to ask someone to take care of your pets for free.  Find out what the going rates for pet sitting and ball park that. At least offer has money. Being your bf in no way obligated him to do anything like this. It‚Äôs nice that he said yes, but now he‚Äôs constrained for the whole time your family is on vacation. He should be compensated for that."
"Honestly this sounds like the best possible reason for this. If this is the case, OP could smooth it over by inviting FIL over for a BBQ or taking him out for a beer and just having a man to man chat with him, make him feel included and important."
"Good on you for being so considerate, seriously. That's a much better story than if you'd done the opposite. 

There's nothing impressive about ""I bothered a famous person trying to eat and he begrudgingly interrupted his quiet evening for me.""

Bleh, we're so selfish in the way we treat celebrities and project our fantasies onto them. So even though he maybe wasn't aware you were being considerate, I'm sure he's grateful for people like you."
"No you aren‚Äôt overreacting. 

Whatever value you were to him before, it wasn‚Äôt enough to make some reasonable space between him and another woman. If I were to bet, his ex didn‚Äôt want him back officially so you were a placeholder."
"You‚Äôve been with him two months. Between the cruelness at the beginning to the now obsessive inability to let him go after an incredibly short period of time, you‚Äôre actually throwing up a large number of red flags. I suggest growing up a bit and working on yourself for awhile. He doesn‚Äôt like you anymore. You can‚Äôt control him and it‚Äôs incredibly selfish to try to. Leave him alone."
"You are 100% right. You are honoring your grandfather by keeping his high standards and refusing to compromise them for the sake of your uncle. In a few years, you can return and open a restaurant in your grandfather's honor. 

&gt;  he offered me carte blanche to what I want and everything. 

You know that's not true. It would only be a little while before your uncle would be meddling in the restaurant again."
"&gt; I think we're not completely sure what either of us wants. 

Then just go with it.  Best platonic friends can become the best romantic friends and the best married couple."
"Yep. I read it an genuinely appreciate the feedback. The good news is I'm comfortable with myself to not be overly shaken by this. I have discussed it with my therapist, friends, and sponsee sister as well as asking about it on reddit to gain insight and perspective so I don't keep making mistakes. 

My friend and now old sponsee sister went to the event and told me that they explained how changing the plans was imposing on everyone else.  That I basically said what everyone was thinking. 

IDK how the sponsor reacted. I can only hope she grows from it too and becomes a better sponsor for it. It just sucks it cost me my sponsorship. Either I'll find someone new or handle it in my own way with my physicians, therapist, psychiatrist,  and strong friend/support network."
That sounds like involving yourself in unnecessary and tiring drama. I would try to just walk away from these situations rather than firing back if you know you're going to sever the relationship. Not for the other person's sake but for your own.
"This is a very good observation, and I‚Äôve definitely considered this. I‚Äôve noticed K being more passive-aggressive toward me, and being less careful with what she says to me or how she says it. Also, having been best friends with K, I know how she is when she hates someone. She‚Äôs nice to them, and then once they‚Äôre away, she *goes off* on how much she can‚Äôt stand them. I‚Äôm going to start paying even closer attention to her behaviors to rule out the possibility of this just being a false picture that S is trying to paint of our roommate. Thanks for this!"
"It is extremely hard. Especially when my textbook says that the victim often has a ‚Äúsense of fear, hopelessness and is shrouded in secrecy‚Äù which is entirely true. My sister brought up the fact that he tries to control what I can and can‚Äôt eat sometimes and I cried. I didn‚Äôt realize how much everything affected me until other people started noticing. 

I‚Äôm done nursing one year from now. I‚Äôm an honours student and I don‚Äôt work at all. My grandpa pays for my car payments and insurance, but I have no idea how I‚Äôd pay for rent and groceries on my own. I also don‚Äôt want to live in a shelter or anything, but I also think that won‚Äôt happen as my family and his family would support me 100% if they knew what was happening. It makes me sad because I do love him, but I know I don‚Äôt want to do this for the rest of my life and I don‚Äôt want my daughter to think any of this is okay either. 

So many emotions lol. I‚Äôm feeling pretty stuck right now though."
This is sexual coercion please leave.
"This may be a bit of a reach, Is it possible that S is playing you and K off each other? From reading your post, none of this stuff is coming from K directly. Unless washing your face was the very last thing you did before leaving and the very first thing when coming back, there was opportunity (she could have also had a ""contaminated"" bottle and just switched it out). 

I've read enough relationship posts to know this is possible, and I would eliminate the possibility before going to a higher up."
This does not sound like a mature or stable relationship.  At all.
"That‚Äôs such an immature and emotionally manipulative response on his part. 

Wanting to spend a couple hours solo with your good friend is healthy and normal. Your SO does not need to be there every time; it doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not wanted. He‚Äôs being really childish."
Do you think that these men have no responsibility for the attention they give her or for choosing how to behave around her? Women are not responsible for the behaviour of men. If she has said she's not interested then it's up to the guys to decide how to behave afterwards.
"Sounds like we married almost the same man. Money issues, lying issues, hiding drug use issues, etc. I'm divorcing mine. You said it wasn't exactly cheating but, yes it was and it was going to get worse. You can't trust him. He's a liar."
Comparing someone to a ford focus while other women are sports cars might not be the best analogy for someone who's obviously dealing with some insecurities
"Thank you, it‚Äôs beggars belief isn‚Äôt it? Only once I reminded him that he asks me to go into his wallet on the regular and there‚Äôs never been a condom in there did he relent. Selfish until the end."
"I agree, go to marriage counseling and see if there's something else going on, but one of you have to budge or else it will not end well."
"&gt; I'm supposed to still be in bed by midnight

i checked your age 3 times. This is embarassing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; She says she lays in bed awake upset and lonely while I'm not there.

then she need to see a specialist. This is not your problem ffs, she is 41. The whole situation is absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

She seems insecure in general(therefore controlling), i think its ultimatum time, either she drops all this controlling rules or you walk. I mean i'm not sure how you could  accept this in the first place."
"Don't do this to yourself dude.

At least go out and have a one year relationship with someone else yourself. If you haven't even done that you are no way ready to start fresh with her.

It will feel like she kicked you out of your house for a year, moved your replacement in, and when she had her fun wants you to care for her.

Dude, even if you are desperate and somewhere in your heart might still want it, it is going to feel so bad, fake and empty when you are together again. You are going to feel lonely and defeated even with her in the room. And when she goes to work you know what she is capable of doing when someone gives her attention. We are talking every damn day she goes out the door, somewhere in your head you will have fears. It's going to wreck you in the long run. You are going to come home one day real tired for work and she will just be running late a bit or something and you will fucking break. You will get the whole breakup circus again.

&amp;#x200B;

Think hard and remember how this woman treats the person she is supposed to love most in life, you. 

Like dirt, like less than a friend, she has been nicer and more respectful to strangers than how she treated you.

You are a god damn beautiful person, go find someone who will respect you and ACTUALLY love you. Who doesn't just want you as a crutch."
"She has a new baby. It is not her responsibility to ""change"" an abusive man and be his therapist and his mommy too. She should leave before it gets worse (because it *will* get worse). 

It is very harmful to suggest women stay with men who treat them poorly, in the hopes that they'll change. What terrible advice."
"I've been in six years and I've had time to finish one semester of school work. Now the Navy has (hopefully temporarily) suspended tuition assistance due to lack of funding. Between deployments, training, and day-to-day work requirements it's almost impossible to get a degree on your own time, despite what recruiting promo materials tell you. OP needs to undo the GI Bill transfer, otherwise he's sacrificing his future for an ungrateful woman whom apparently resents him."
"I think you should tell his wife everything. If they're going to get divorced then surely she deserves to know exactly what is going on, if only to make the terms of the separation clear. This might even be the catalyst for her to leave him immediately.

Maybe you'd be better off asking in a legal or medical subreddit to find out if there can be any kind of psychiatric intervention as part of the process? I really don't know how these things work, I'm afraid."
"\&gt; My boyfriend makes almost 3x what I do but he always wanted the bills  split 50/50. 

&amp;#x200B;

You're pretty much a second income for him. Sweet deal for him. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;I work two jobs making $7.25 an hour at one and i waitress  on the weekend andm ake $2.55 an hour plus tips. Some times I bring in  really good money but most times I don't. Ive had to struggle to make  sure my share of the bills are paid but I never wanted him to feel liek I  was taking advantage of him or being a mooch (something my mom would  call me and I hate being called that) 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not your share, it's your share plus some of his. You are being taken advantage of. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; I don't get paid until next Friday and I asked my boyfriend he could  either let me take his car (I dont have my own and we share his) so I  could make the 16 hour drive to help settle my dads estate and get his  finial wishes together or if he could loan me the money for a plane  ticket and I would pay him back with my next check. His response was ""*Absolutely not. Not my fault he had a shitty heart. You dont deserve my money. Figure it out on your own""* and left for work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your boyfriend's response is abhorrent. Absolutely fucking disgusting. Dump him NOW, go to your father's funeral, and after that, move out into your own place. I guarantee you you will start feeling better right away."
"This gave me chills to read, but I know you‚Äôre right. This is terrifying to think about. Fuck. I definitely didn‚Äôt realize how serious this could actually be, holy shit."
"If you're bothered about finding out, i'd tell each of them a different version of a similar story to do with you. Something innocuous enough but enough that it could be seen as ''gossip''. See which version makes its way back to you the fastest."
"Except it is sexual harassment. Every place I've ever worked at has had sexual harassment training outlining what constitutes as sexual harassment, and unwanted flirting is absolutely considered harassment."
"Or the FFIL learns he can ""get his feelings hurt"" about anything, throw a fit about it, and get his way, no matter how unreasonable the thing he wanted."
IDK about messing with your teeth but like... it's pretty gross to suck on your thumb all day because you're touching things with your hands and that spreads germs - both to other people and to yourself.
"You‚Äôre not wrong for breaking up with her, you want what you want. BUT that‚Äôs sexist still."
Yeah and you're able to execute that healthily when you have your own personal boundaries established inside. Which means that people like this go bye. Healthy boundaries don't play with this business.
"You either hold him accountable and teach him to be an adult, you feed into his babied lifestyle, or you break up. 

Granted option one is dependent on his willingness to be an adult."
"I agree. When you‚Äôre young and in school you are surrounded by people in the exact same life stage as you so it‚Äôs very easy to make friends. Also as a young person a few years in age can make a world of difference in behavior, but as an adult it really isn‚Äôt important"
"I would recommend trying to decouple your friend making efforts.  The way to maximize your chances of making friends is to do it on your own and when you've struck something up that feels more genuine, you add the spouse in. This ensures that some nice easy next steps after the first successful hangs (""we should get together with the husbands next time. I'd love for you to meet Pete-  I think he'd get along with Bill"" yadda yadda). 

Also, I can relate to the same circumstances of being the double income, no kid in the group. To be honest, I think you should embrace this as an honor. I pay for nice dinners, hotel rooms, flight upgrades a lot. It's an opportunity for me to feel like I can provide a nice relaxing time for a friend and a good memory for us as well. What I know is this-- my friends with kids are struggling...  they don't have a lot of extra time or money. Emotionally most of them are happy with their decisions but feel very underwater. If I can get some of that time (a resource they don't have much of but are choosing to spend with me), I shouldn't feel miffed by spending some of my resources too."
"""He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has ""wronged"" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to ""do right by me"" and not end things until I was ready.""

&amp;#x200B;

What a clever way to say ""I'm a coward"""
I‚Äôm literally in the middle of the Mediterranean right now and can‚Äôt figure out how to DM you (whole page won‚Äôt load properly.) If you have Venmo (or want to make a GFM) message that to me with the $ you need and I can help (gift not loan.)
No they won‚Äôt. Personal travel is not paid for by the military.
The only one being sexist here is you.
"He‚Äôs 24....  he‚Äôll mature eventually and start acting like an adult.  Maybe take up knitting and by the time he‚Äôs 40 he won‚Äôt be so defensive over the style of cardigan  you knit for him and the kids.

Alternative you could realise you have the right to accept much better from a 24 yr old man. He‚Äôs not a boy so you shouldn‚Äôt have to navigate around childish behaviour.

You‚Äôre young....  don‚Äôt waste a moment if you life.

Good luck."
"That's what set off my Spidey sense. It's like hold up. 

I feel like there is stuff being left out."
"Sounds like there‚Äôs nothing to do here by you then. She could do with telling him that if he keeps this shit up he‚Äôll not be invited to the wedding either.

But honestly this is a powerplay by dad. You and your wife need to be joint when coming at this. Don‚Äôt try to win back his favour as you‚Äôve done nothing wrong, do have you and your wife organise some conversation where he is told to let it go and if he‚Äôs genuinely hurt then that‚Äôs a shame but ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"My mother, who has always been my best friend, once told me, ""Kallistrate, I know you tell me all about your life and I treasure that, and I know you're going to go out into the world and have sexual experiences, and that's normal and wonderful and healthy.  I want you to know that I'm here for you if you *ever* have any questions or need any help ...but outside of those criteria, I don't want to hear about it.""

This is why.

Everybody's sexual perspective is intensely personal and unique to them.  We are all offshoots of our parents in one way or another, and so to have something so intensely personal turned on its head, especially with all the societal values that change around sex over generations, it's upsetting and confusing.

Your mother will get over it in time, but I wouldn't bring up sex stuff with her again unless you need help.  It's complicated enough to discuss with friends and partners, much less with people who still emotionally remember you as a toddler in diapers."
"There are plenty of things an adult can do on their own for a couple hours, even in (especially?) In an unfamiliar town. Coffee shops, bars, breweries, restaurants, parks, walks.. read a book, see a movie, etc.  your boyfriend should be capable of spending a few hours alone in order for you to get some quality time with a friend."
"&gt; but she is unable to do it.

And she will never have any incentive to do it herself as long as there is someone to do it for her. There is a saying that goes, *""you never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.""*"
"Some people don't just casually enjoy things - if they become a fan of something they go all in. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (although it can be).  If it's something you truly can't deal with, you might not be compatible."
"The actual point in your period when you're bleeding isnt the only time that a woman's cycle could impact her desire or ability to have sex. It's very reasonable for a woman to have extreme physical symptoms (cramps,bloating, pain, etc) for up to a week before, plus a week of bleeding.

Honestly, if my partner was implying that I'm just ""claiming"" to have issues with my cycle, that would drain any desire I have to touch him."
"Leave him, yesterday. This guy is pure manipulative trash. Life will take care of him."
"This is the truth nuke, shockwave heard around the world."
"I think it‚Äôs fine if not everyone is best buddies with their friends partners. It‚Äôs normal for best friends to want to spend alone time without partners present. 

And... it sounds like he‚Äôs maybe a little immature and controlling. You have very little
Contact with friends because you spend most of your time with him, you should be able to spend time with friends without feeling guilted or pressured by him."
It says in the post they‚Äôve seen multiple doctors and tried a lot of different things. This seems to very much be a last resort.
"I would probably cancel the date and let him know you expect him to be able to pay and take you out to make it up to you, but that you'd rather not spend the anniversary with him. If the weed is more important to him he can spend it alone getting high. I think you need to be explicit about your expectations and create a real consequence here. 

If you decide it isn't worth confronting him, than this relationship is already dead and it's time to move on."
"Stay at home dad here. Homebody, too.

People often think that staying at home is 'the dream'. 

Remember.. we live where we work. The home is our job. We never 'leave' our work. It's constantly there, in front of us. Every bit of dirty laundry, dirty dish and smudge on the floor, even during our 'evenings off' is a reminder of our work. 

We need time off too. I love my children, my family, my life. But my dream day is a day to enjoy my home without any responsibility in it. A day where I don't feel the need to cook or clean or repair anything. I don't even want to be asked what to eat.. no food decisions. Just a day off."
What should you do? Divorce his sorry ass.
"This. Just put in enough to cover joint expenses. If he is the one doing the bills get involved now. If he isn‚Äôt he wont know until after you set everything up.  Make sure he is on the up and up with his stuff too.  

First expense after this?  A spa day because you obviously need some relaxation. Good luck and take a firm stand with him. He will hate it but you deserve much better."
"I get the feeling that this situation is much more complicated than this post lets on. Not saying you're being deceitful, not at all, only that I don't think a Reddit post can fully encapsulate what it is you (both) are dealing with. Working 60-80 hours a week and being emotionally distant (you don't intimate how long this has been going on for) is a recipe for disaster in any relationship -- let alone one where moving and job turnover are apparently regular occurrences -- and can have serious effects upon one's own mental health and that of their partner. Should you choose to call the marriage off, I would not advise that you start dating again until you sort things out from both a personal and a professional standpoint."
"Look, it's not just what you say when people are looking. It's what you actually think and say in private. You don't consider yourself shallow but you did an extremely shallow thing.

A lot of group or private 1:1 piling on with friends is quite fun. Totally true! Very intelligent people do it, both in IQ and EQ. But, it's also a very shallow thing to do. I can't do this for example, because I'm big on encouraging people, so when I try to dunk, I tend to imagine the person with his/her dreams, desires etc. and just can't. Even if it's dunking for a mistake, I imagine how they must feel and how they will want to fix it.

Is it possible you were processing some combination of old (date) frustration, disappointment, possible insecurity into this cynical edge? Maybe there's some alternative ways to express your feelings."
"Would it be possible to sort of lay low for a while? Avoid your mom as much as possible so you don't get into arguments? 

Or is there anyone at school you could talk to? Maybe you could stay with a class mate for the last two months. I agree that it would be best to be able to finish high school where you are, it's so near to the end."
I'd get the police involved to at least give her a scare to stop if you have enough of the evidence that she is clearly the person doing all of this.
"This is a tough situation, I‚Äôm really sorry op. Have you tried everything to make it up to her, is she willing to listen? Maybe couples counseling could help? This is obviously a tough spot for both of you, that‚Äôs not easy to go through. Either way, I personally highly recommend talking to a counselor. I‚Äôve been myself and it really helped me through some really dark times. Talking to someone is super helpful, keeping it bottled up just makes it even worse- speaking from experience. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to a counselor but still want someone to talk to (or even just listen), feel free to chat me or comment in this thread. Always happy to help üôÇ"
"At first, I was sure it was just a misunderstanding. People's behavior change after massive consumption of alcohol. However, the more I read, the more concerning it gets. Especially after you voiced your concern. It should be a ""oh shoot, I didn't mean to make him feel bad, let me be careful from now on"" not the silent treatment she is giving you now."
"Okay. Listen. Let me lay something down to you. 

I‚Äôm married, currently separated. My husband did this while we were dating and I stayed. He would get mad if I didn‚Äôt have my location on, he‚Äôd ask me questions to make sure I wasn‚Äôt lying about where I was, he wanted ALL of my passwords (he even used my thumb print one night when I was asleep). And he would try to be like, here are my passwords (after we got married) and everything. But from time to time, I would express the unfairness and there would be a fight. He would get mad if I didn‚Äôt invite him to go see my dad and step mom (who hate him) but wouldn‚Äôt go to see my mom and step dad (who tolerated him), he got upset because my sister invited me to go to sonic and didn‚Äôt invite him. When we were dating, I couldn‚Äôt have guy friends because all of my guy friends wanted to sleep with me but he could have chick friends because he wasn‚Äôt like that (he cheated 4x while we dated). 

If you‚Äôre 10 months, and you‚Äôre noticing the red flags, you really gotta reevaluate your relationship. Not saying to end it, but saying that things can definitely get worse. 

Prayers!"
"This is almost all about you. You use the word ""I"" so  many times that it's hard to keep count and you make a ton of excuses for this because you got caught out.

There's very little about the guy and very little about the impact this has on him.

&gt;I generally am not a mean or judgmental person but I don't know why I go so negative about dates.

This is not true. You literally were mean and judgmental and he has proof."
"UGH oh god, you have a good point. got the heebie jeebies reading the post + all the comments and this one got the ultimate ""guhhhh."""
"I think the real question here is; why do you feel uncomfortable when you see that he has kept these pictures? Why do you think that he needs to erase the evidence of his past to let go? It sounds like it stems from a deep insecurity. 

I have pictures of everyone I ever dated, and occasionally I scroll through all my photos to remember the journey that my life has been. If I felt like I needed to delete them, it wouldn't be a sign that I had let go; it would be a sign that I was still so attached to those relationships that I need to actively distance myself from the thought of them."
You just say that because your thetan scores are low
"See, from what you've been writing, it sounds like lack of physical affection *is* a big deal for you.  She also seems to not be meeting other needs recently--not talking to you, not accepting the boyfriend label, etc.  How is communication between you two normally?  Have you ever had a talk about an issue of this importance to you before?  How does she usually respond?

Also...she travels away from home for weeks at a time and has a coworker that she *is* physical with?  Does he travel with her?  Is it always to the same place?  Because if so...well, you can do the math."
"I‚Äôm not a morning person and I would kindly ask my SO to never wake me up early for a run lol, otherwise I think you are a bit sensitive and he is a bit defensive. Incompatible"
"Yes it is valid to break up with her.

However don't expect her to wait around or have any expectation you can go back to her once you're done being single. 

If you break up, break up for good, leave no false hope for either of you. She can move on and find someone else and so can you."
"It's so easy when there's no kids involved.

Buy her a ticket back to the town she left.

Get all your other affairs in order.  Get a divorce.  Be happy alone (at least for a while) and get your career back on track."
"Cold shower before bed may cause more sweat. Going from cold water to hot air and all. Maybe try warm shower.

Maybe add a fan to her side of bed. Maybe add a dehumidifier to room. Definitely a lot of potential solutions to this yall can try."
"You don't have to go no contact but definitely don't be alone with your grandparents after that. If they are fixated on this idea that you steal and take drugs, you need someone to witness when you're there."
Oh....so now we don't have all the details. Lol....you are truly a clown. OP save up and move out. Then you both can deal with your house issues as you please. And get you a grown up next please.
"&gt; ""I can't really be myself with anyone else... blah blah"".

This is a red flag, and not for you, but for her. It sounds that she wants to define herself within the context of your life and that will lead to a codependent and unhealthy relationship. It sounds like there is something she is looking for. She did not find it after her miscarriage, she did not find it in the divorce, she did not find it in her previous relationships and I can promise you that she will not find it in you. 

She is looking to you so that you can give her a sense of purpose. She is looking to you so that you can give her meaning. She is looking to you so that she can find direction. You have never, nor will you ever provide for her these things because these are things that she can only provide for herself. If you think you can, you will place an impossible burden on yourself, one that will exhaust you and you will create an insatiable ""monster"" in the sense that no matter what you do, she will never be happy and she will always demand more from you.

She needs time to find out who she is, and to develop internal mental and emotional resources that will enable her to be able to carve out her own path in life. If your paths cross, if you have more in common, then that is what is known as compatibility. If she develops differently, different values, different tastes and different goals, then you would be incompatible. Do not deceive yourself by believing that you can find her own purpose for her. Doing so will only rob her of an opportunity to be emotionally and mentally independent and self determined. Your actions may seem noble, but you will be doing more harm than good."
Someone should slide a mention of this to his fiancee if she doesn't know. I get why this bothers you. That's not great company for your boyfriend to keep.
"In how many other areas of your shared lives is he completely passive, expecting you to do literally all of the work and take all of the initiative while he contributes absolutely zero physical or emotional energy?

I'm curious."
"Who, that you know and trust to be totally honest, has seen these Facetimes go down?

I wonder if it is less catfishing, and more delusional stalker behavior on his part. It sounds like he is constructing a alternate reality and preparing to track her down. Moving there to be with her could translate to moving closer to make stalking her easier. 

What he is doing needs to be made known to his wife, his parents, his friends ‚Äî because the people involved here could be very seriously hurt if he continues to devolve into this delusional obsession. People can‚Äôt protect themselves and see things coming without all the facts."
"I think moving would be helpful if DH ""got it"" and wanted to change.  If he was genuinely motivated to keep them out of their marriage, it's helpful when they can't show up at your door unannounced.  But if he is really wedded to his parents (and I use that term deliberately!) he will just skype them 3 nights a week for 4 hours after he moves.  I don't think it will really solve the problem unless DH wants to solve the problem.  It's not clear that he even perceives there is a problem."
She likes receiving gifts from you. To her it's a gesture that shows that you care. It's probably one of her love languages; you should google it and take a look.
"All of my past SOs have been understanding. Usually I only tell people about it if I think it might be an issue. Most of my casual friends never find out because I'm able to tolerate small gestures like a slight embrace in passing from a casual friend now. Especially pretty much all of my casual friends are girls. 

Unfortunately, physical contact has always just been something I tolerate, if at all. It was only at the end of my last relationship that I even started to relax enough to enjoy any kind of contact. Usually my body automatically tenses up and I lose the ability to move away from the person, basically like a wild animal that's so scared it can't move. If they're understanding enough and sit with me for a while I sometimes start to come around a little. I don't understand why it's so bad for me, but when I was much younger, in middle school, I would scream if anyone touched me and flinch away even if it was an accident. Sometimes afterwards I would end up with uncontrollable shaking or rocking back and fourth, but things are much better now. It's really upsetting to have any kind of relapse."
"This this! The greatest gift OP‚Äôs mom ever gave her was stubbornly refusing to move closer. I know it doesn‚Äôt feel like it now, but mom will continue to bring chaos and damage to OP‚Äôs life &amp; it will be a dysfunctional relationship for her son to witness. What a painful thing to realize that you put all of your effort into a parent that refuses to see you. What a painful thing it‚Äôd be for a grandchild to come to the same conclusion. (I am that child, I am that grandchild). 

OP, cut her off. You deserve better. You have a family that deserves your energy. You have love in your life, love you have chosen. Get therapy and grieve the absence of a mother who should have done better. And fuck all the little gnats flying around trying to pass judgment on a situation they refuse to actually deal with themselves."
"It doesn‚Äôt matter how much she works or doesn‚Äôt, shouting matches and the silent treatment if she doesn‚Äôt clean to his standards or asks for help is completely inappropriate."
"I'm sure there are women that would love to be an old-fashioned stay at home mom, but asking your gf to give up her job like that is pretty yikes. In the future, be upfront about what you want."
"This seems to be a big theory among my fellow Redditors and I definitely need to pay closer attention to this! I‚Äôm sure S has talked shit about me before because we have butted heads but we‚Äôve always worked it out. K, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt address her problems with me or S directly. We find out from other people who tell us, ‚Äúhey, K said you guys are having this problem,‚Äù and then when we confront K about it and she *always* denies it. It‚Äôs fishy, because it‚Äôs never just the same one or two people telling us her complaints. It‚Äôs different people she bitches to. It‚Äôs so weird. But I‚Äôm definitely going to be paying more attention to both K and S in terms of their behaviors! Thank you for this!"
"I've been with my husband since I was 21. The difference between our relationship year two and year 12 is night and day. I could write a novel, but the important thing that you can work on (no guarantees) is communication. It's the holy grail. You have to learn how to argue in a way that makes real, practical change in the relationship and doesn't tear the other person down. You have to be able to hear that someone's sick of the jealousy or the lack of support in the housework and make functional changes. You also have to be able to voice your grievances with the expectation that you're heard and that accommodations are made. When you can problem-solve together for the sticking points, you grow together and you create systems that enhance the harmony of the dynamic. If you JADE any criticism (justify, argue, defend, explain) on spec, things fall apart quickly. Sometimes it took us three or four years to hammer out an issue (he doesn't like to apologize; I had to learn to stop yelling) but our willingness to keep talking about it, keep trying to solve for what was bugging us, make it clear that progress was possible and that we'd figure it out. Perfection can't be the goal, but evidence of real effort does the trick most of the time."
Honestly sounds less like a money issue and more about a maturity issue. He isn't putting in any effort to be an equal partner. It sounds like he's floating through life and he isn't doing anything to be a fully functioning human
So what's so great about him that you'll put up with the back-and-forth? Why are you wasting your time with this guy when you could be with someone who doesn't do this to you?
"This sounds slightly creepy but when I lived with my dad, he would always go on tangents, saying his stories... I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be living with him forever so I sometimes would secretly voice record his stories. So I could still listen to them in the future.."
"The two of you are not compatible and she is bringing you down. She‚Äôs also threatened divorce several times. Leave her.


Also, thank you for your service!"
"I'm glad you know this.  That way you know it's not you, it's him.  Sometimes these people have a way of convincing you that you're wrong."
"Men like this don‚Äôt change, I‚Äôm sorry OP. He knows what he‚Äôs doing, he knows he‚Äôs being a dick, and no perfect chore-chart is going to change the fact that ultimately he just *doesn‚Äôt want to*.

To me, this is like fighting about money... sure, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúone little problem‚Äù but managing a household together is actually a huge part of being in a relationship. If he won‚Äôt participate in that then find someone who will."
Some things truly are unforgivable and that‚Äôs ok. You need to make your family understand that while you are glad he realizes he is scumbag that‚Äôs a chapter of your past you have no interest in reopening and will never forgive him for the lasting effects his actions have had on you. You blocked him everywhere because you don‚Äôt even want to hear his name anymore and every time it‚Äôs brought up for any reason it‚Äôs upsetting to you. You are never going to speak to this person again for any reason under any circumstance and would really appreciate it if your friends and a family also blocked him but if that‚Äôs too big of an ask you will accept them simply never mentioning anything about him to you ever again.
probably doing the bro thing and letting OP know something is up without telling him directly. You see this kind of thing often in this sub
"Reading the title, I thought your post was going to be similar to my relationship. Often, when we're busy and can't reach the phone, we'll ask each other to read the messages aloud and text for us. Such as when one of us is driving or washing the dishes. Even then, some of my friends seemed uncomfortable with it even though we're all in the same chat group. It just seems mildly deceitful to them. 

But we're not logged onto each other's accounts, we don't snoop into different chats, all contact is explicitly acknowledged and requested. Your sister's relationship is really weird, it feels like he's monitoring all her conversations and controlling her relationships. I'd say, STOP texting her. Make a separate family chat WITHOUT HER IN IT so that you can continue to talk to your family without also talking to your sister's husband. Start exclusively calling her or sending voice clips to talk. Keep your conversations with her private and away from her husband so that if she ever really needs to talk about him, she can do it without him watching.

Oh and NEVER share log in details with her ever. She may be trustworthy, but there's no reason to trust her husband."
"She's one of those people who needs to be around others to recharge (an energy vampire), she's not getting enough from you, so that's why she still feels empty. She needs to go out to do an activity with a lot of people around at least one or two times a week.

She is being extremely controlling making you adapt to her sleep schedule, especially at 8 or 9pm. She's acting like she's 80, not in her 40s. It sounds like she never learned how to self-soothe herself to sleep"
"Honestly my best friend from high school is much better off financially than me. She lives about 5 hours away. When I come over, I stay in her guest room. She always treats for meals or expensive activities that we end up doing because she knows that I can't keep up. I'm fine hanging out and chatting, but she wants to get out and do things as well. 

To her, it's valuable that I take the time to come and see her (her kids are in a lot of activities so she has rarely come to see me). She's not the type of person to ever throw what they do for you in your face, so I've gradually relaxed about her spending for dinners and such. 

If you don't want to treat people, then don't. But don't necessarily look at it as they just come to take. Are they giving back in a different way? If your old friends are busy with their kids, are recitals and sports games something you could enjoy?"
"I am so glad you are divorcing him. He isn't worthy of you.

What I see when I read your post is that you are an extremely strong, amazing woman who has the best years still ahead of her, will make the most and best out of it and thrive. 

It's very inspiring!"
I wish I could upvote this multiple times.
"She‚Äôs going on dates with this guy. No, it‚Äôs not a thing you should be ok with."
"You‚Äôre right, I didn‚Äôt realize I said ‚Äúeverything is great.‚Äù I know it‚Äôs not. The good times are great** Thanks a bunch."
"Lol you're in a casual relationship so why do you care? To me, it doesn't sound creepy at all, I get along well with my brother's friends, and might even trust them more to bring me back home safe. I don't know why you're making a fuss out of it, especially since you don't want any serious relationship with her. Why do you care?"
"I think you should speak to your mom.
Ask her why she goes eating with your sister to the your town but never invite you.

If it's bother you, it's better to talk about and have an answer than overthinking it"
"wow, i think i've realised why i've been feeling the same way with my boyfriend. thank you for this post."
He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to her‚Äù but I never heard the follow up. I didn‚Äôt ask either.
"&gt; This particular person has a history of cutting people off.

Something I learned a long time ago is that when someone engages in a particular behavior towards other people, it‚Äôs a good bet they are/will engage in that behavior towards you. Taking a good look at how people treat their other friends gives you a good idea of how you will be treated, through both good times and bad.

The other thing to consider is the old saying, ‚ÄúIf you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know your friend, but maybe the fact that she repeatedly cuts people off means *she‚Äôs* the asshole, and not them."
"I truly admire your ‚Äúwhatever floats your boat within reason‚Äù attitude, because I am plagued by codependent shame, but in this case, you are right to be concerned. Not just for the feelings of the object of you mother‚Äôs attention, but for your mother. While this looks like advanced fandom, what your mom is doing is stalker behavior. It‚Äôs a continuum, but the difference is ignoring the rational advice and observations of friends/family. The stalker rationalizes that her/his advances are not unwanted, or not threatening, and therefore do not qualify as ‚Äústalking.‚Äù This kind of behavior may be a way of managing stress or trauma, and it is sometimes linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs. This behavior is a symptom. The assessment and treatment of the cause is above Reddit‚Äôs pay grade. Are there other people close to you/ your mother who could help you get her some help? Even if she sees it as humoring you. If she insists that it‚Äôs ridiculous to worry about her over ‚Äúnothing,‚Äù know that the fantasy of some sort of relationship with the object of her fandom serves some function to her psyche. She won‚Äôt let it go without help."
"This is true, but a lot of moms (me included) often use the ""time to ourselves"" to do chores that are hard to do with a kid around. If he's taking the kid to swim class and she's using the time alone to do laundry or clean the bathroom or vacuum, then it's not time off."
"I'm pretty sure she is too. Shes admitted to me before that she didnt care if she lived or died but she also told me that she doesnt feel that way anymore since our daughter was born. I think shes lost touch with that.

How do I bring this all up to her though? Every time ive tried in the past she's shut me out or not listened to anything ive said."
"I think we live in a day and age where that kind of thinking is pretty antiquated, and I would agree, rather sexist. I am sure there are women out there that would like to be stay at home moms, but for you to try to force that narrative onto someone is inappropriate. If your necessity for someone to submit to you outweighs your love and respect for them, there is likely a problem there."
"There is a LOT of value in being sort of fun aunts/uncles to your friends‚Äô kids if you‚Äôre interested.

If you aren‚Äôt, then I wouldn‚Äôt bother trying either."
"&gt;I don't want to let him move on because it's breaking my heart 

That‚Äôs an extremely selfish and controlling thing to say.  You don‚Äôt ‚Äúlet‚Äù anyone do anything. He is a person, he should be your equal, and you don‚Äôt control or own him, and can‚Äôt grow-beat someone into staying with you.

Of course your heart is breaking, but that‚Äôs because of your own choices. And what about how *he* feels ? Everything you talk about here is me, me, me and how you feel, but nothing about how he feels. Like my previous comment, you really need some therapy and I hope you will get it."
"We are talkers in every facet of our lives, including intimacy.  I feel that the only issue that he has is that I don't attack him every possible moment like some sex crazed spider monkey.  My issue is that - why should I always be the one?  Makes it feel like a job."
They will fund an early release of dependents only from an OCONUS location
"Yes. Honestly, either S or K likely messed with your stuff. Do not name names unless asked who you suspect. Just ask for a transfer and show the evidence."
"It's one of those ""rationally it's true but practically i'm going to bawl my eyes out"" type of things."
"Also: does she do the bulk of the housework and childcare stuff? If so, maybe try doing more in that area for a while to see if it makes a difference for her. It‚Äôs a pretty common issue that women feel like they are doing two jobs (their day job and being a housewife) and don‚Äôt feel the energy or interest in sex as they would if they had less on their plates.

It could be that while your work and sacrifices are well meant, maybe they aren‚Äôt the things that would help?"
My boyfriend is in the same spot and we made the agreement that they couldn‚Äôt do things that would be placed we went on dates. So lunch and dinner or working out or sports games were fine but then going to a club or movie was more of a ‚Äúdate‚Äù which is reserved for me and it‚Äôs worked out fine
"Sure, but those people usually COMMUNICATE their reasons."
"Wow. As a mother I cant imagine doing any of those things she has been doing, not one of your examples. The thing is, when you have to split up you have to put your sensible, practical and unemotional face on, and do what's best for the kiddo. Feelings have to be put to one side and all focus should remain firmly on the child, and it sounds like this is what you're doing. She sounds spiteful and petty, and willing to make her child miss out on fun childhood activities just to spite you. This is not acceptable and not something a decent mother would do.

 I would advise logging times/dates/examples of when she is refusing and denying him care and taking care of her duties as a mother, if it goes to court it will really REALLY help you. Being specific really helps, so rather than being in court explaining that shes generally unreliable  you can say instead ""there are 7 examples in 2 weeks that she has neglected him by sleeping it off on the couch while he is out, or been spiteful in her decision not to take him somewhere he enjoys because I was the one who arranged it"" (just an example).

Sounds like you're doing a great job, mediation might be your only answer right now, just do not let her bait you into fights and arguments. You cant win with people like that, keep your head held high and keep putting your son first.

You're doing a great job OP."
Because stalkers aren't a thing.
"He's never actually said it, but by his actions and the guilt trip he gives you, he's getting the same outcome without outright looking like an asshole. I wouldn't be surprised if he does end up escalating to out right saying you can't. 

It's all just an assumption, but I had a best friend who was in a relationship like yours. Her bf at the time pulled the same shit. He didn't like her having ""girl time"", he always wanted to come and if he didn't get to he sulked and threw out comments about ""just wanting to be included"". It eventually turned into when and if she could hang out and if he couldn't come, he started arguments about how he doesn't understand WHY him coming was an issue."
"THIS.  I am so, so sad for you, OP.  My jaw was just hanging open when I read his replies to your plea for help.  Your bf is an insensitive, selfish, controlling asshole.  How could ANYONE respond to your situation with such contempt?  You deserve empathy and kindness.  You deserve a bf who says ‚Äúof COURSE you can borrow money for a plane ticket‚Äù and not rush you to pay him back, ESPECIALLY when he makes 3x what you do. 

And your mom is no better, but sounds like you know that. 

I hope you can find a way to get there OP.  Do you have any friends that could help, a little bit here and there?  Because even I, a stranger, want to help you out.  And let me tell you, you are not a mooch and working 3 jobs is really hard, so don‚Äôt let anyone else tell you otherwise. 

When all the dust settles with your father‚Äôs funeral, I hope you can get away from this bf and make him your ex.  He does not deserve you and you don‚Äôt deserve to be treated like this."
I don't think you should make any plans to have a baby at this point.  Your husband is completely inflexible.
"I would report that your personal property was messed with, but you are not sure by whom.

I wouldn‚Äôt trust S or K right now.  All of the bad stories you have heard about K come from S.  You do not have verification that her attitude toward you is correct.  S seems to have an alibi for your cleanser being messed with but pouring pine sol in it wouldn‚Äôt take that long. It could have just as easily occurred right before you left.  Report, and maybe ask for a new room assignment."
"More than half the population have either HSV1 or HSV2 and most don't know it.  You're discarding her because she's well informed, takes care of herself and is honest.  Your call, dude."
THIS SHOULD BE AT THE VERY TOP OF THE LIST!!!!
"Another clinically anxious person backing this up.  She is absolutely in control of this. And what‚Äôs worse is when you bring it up as a problem, she brushes it off. Not ok."
"Please don‚Äôt give her another chance, she is unstable and she will do this again the first chance she gets"
"He's probably one of those guys who won't listen to a woman telling him to leave her alone, but he'll listen if a man tells him to leave her alone. Saying that YOU wouldn't like it gives it more power."
"Sorry, OP. But you chose someone who is just like your mom, do you really want to spend your whole life never getting a moment alone and someone controlling you?"
"&gt; I don't blame her for wondering what else is out there.

I do. Stop excusing her cheating."
dude i just spent the past hour going through OP‚Äôs past advice on other relationship threads and holy shit they give the greatest and most balanced answers EVER. u/MLeek you are a legend ! thank you for putting in so much effort to try to help!
"Im so sorry OP. He sounds like a scumbag... you will be much better off without him. It will take time, relish the numbness while you can."
"Intimacy is about far more than just plain old fucking. In the weekends and possibly some evenings as well, you can take all the time you want to be intimate with her. 

For instance, start of by giving her a full body massage, slowly (!) working your way around and towards her sensitive parts. Try kissing her in the neck or thighs to spice things up even more. Maybe even try some candles or music, whatever suits the both of you and feels pleasant. Next, the massage can smoothly transition into finger play and oral when you feel like you've massaged all her muscles. Don't expect her to cum (like never) but DO expect yourself to give her the best treatment ever. Listen to her breathing, notice how her body squirming responds to what you are doing and hopefully even listen to her vocal 'assistence' and follow that lead. In general, start of slow and without too much pressure on the clit and build up the sexual tension (and pressure and speed) from slowly and continuously. Do not stop and switch pressure/speed too quickly. If you feel like she's past her top pleasure-wise or reached a level she can't surpass, you can finally start fucking her. 

It can very well be that you are coming 'too soon' because the both of you (!) have adopted a fucking repertoire that's too tense/fast for you to handle. My gf can get me to cum in 30 seconds if she wants to, but when we take time for each other we can go on for 10, 20, 30 minutes of fucking without me cumming. It's all about toying with each others body and recognizing how your own and your partners bodies work. If I come too soon it's just as much on her as it is on me (except if I'm the only one who decides on the rithm). 

You really can't blame yourself for cumming too soon. You can only blame yourself for not taking enough time to please her. Fucking is just a small part of 'intimacy' all together.

You seem way too tough on yourself and this seems like a very tense topic. I can only advice you guys to openly talk about it. And try to remember this is not YOUR fault, this is an issue of the BOTH of you. You can't fix this on your own and your gf certainly can't either. Confess to her that you have difficulty discussing this subject, but you are very willing to do it anyway because there is a lot of long lost intimacy to be made up. Love her instead of stressing yourself out."
"Don't let that tampered-with bottle out of your sight/possession.  If she has an inkling that you're going to report her, she'll try to dispose of it."
I get the vibe that she doesn‚Äôt really ask. I feel like she gives like an hour or two heads up and then knocks on the door.
"Also, I think OP's mom is a little bit control freak. Hypocrisy, especially of this kind, is a textbook nature of control freaks."
"You're married to a loser. You only know about the lies that you've caught him in, and you're delusional if you think you've caught even half of them. Time for divorce."
