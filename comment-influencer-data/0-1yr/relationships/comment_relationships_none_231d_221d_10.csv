Did he want to move in with you or with your stuff?
Sounds like he already took you on trip... a guilt trip
"Take the job. Take. the. job. Take it take it take it. You will resent him for the rest of your relationship if you don't and he'll get used to the extra income pretty quickly. It sucks that he feels like that, and maybe some therapy is in order, which you'll be able to pay for with your new! plush! job! "
"My fiance exhibited these behaviors.  It was more than hanger. It's verbal abuse. 

You fixing food for him is a privilege that he should be grateful for. 

You need to confront him and tell him his behavior is unacceptable and ""hanger"" is not an excuse to treat you like shit. If he's hungry after working out he can stop somewhere and get food his damn self. 



"
"Frankly, this kind of uncompromising attitude would be a dealbreaker for me even considering having kids with him. You're not crazy at all. Your logic is infalliable and you've offered compromises. He's being an asshole. 

He doesn't get to rule your marriage or your child's life with an iron fist like a little dictator-wannabe. Period.

If your husband doesn't like it, he can go marry his father and raise kids with him.

Get into couples counseling and double up on your birth control."
"I think that you're bringing a whole lot of other problems into this one thing. Your marriage is not in a good place and you would have every right to divorce him.Seriously, the personal grooming and the depression and the porn addiction and the chores, that's a LOT. I'd say too much.

But if you DO want to stick it out, then you need to not bring those problems into things that aren't actually that bad. He did stand up, ok. He's trying something new, for himself. Those are the things that will get you out of a depression and give you a reason to actually shower for once. "
"Adults in adult relationships do not ""allow"" or ""not allow"" each other to do things, whether it's spending money or anything else. They have adult conversations about things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Healthy adults also don't dismiss their partners' opinions as ""unfathomably silly"" or make snide comments under their breath they won't own up to.  


So this exact issue isn't necessarily a red flag, but his overall behavior would be a huge problem for me. "
"If you haven't, already, you need to check your credit report to make sure they haven't used your information for identity theft.  And then put a freeze on your credit so they can't fraudulently use your credit."
"Why do I feel like this is all something of a set up? No parameters, no budget, no input--then shoots down every idea and makes you feel terrible, greedy and grubby about it? 

That's not a gift, that's a jerk making a grand empty gesture with no intention of following through. I'd wager he'll get increasingly impossible about it until you just throw up your hands in defeat, and then he's off the hook.

Charming."
"Sorry to break this to you, your boyfriend has already moved on."
"I think you should take an active interest in helping her find things that can make her feel connected there. You are on cloud 9 there and I get why. But she is homesick and feeling isolated and this might get worse if you don’t empathize a little more with her daily frustrations. I’ve been there with an ex and he never really validated how miserable I was in the city we lived and just kept saying, “just two more years...”. Until two turned into four and I was so lonely and miserable feeling like I was letting my life just happen, waiting for him to be ready to move.

You should set her up with a spa day while you take the baby. Or fly her back home for a week to see family. Or find a community centered around things that she likes to do and encourage her to join in.

But mostly, just listen to her and empathize. If she is feeling frustrated, don’t just launch into why you love it so much and get your sales pitch ready for staying. Let her be sad or uncomfortable or whatever and just validate she feels that way. She knows where you stand and why, but it sounds like you still have some time to make a hard decision. So for the time being, just let her vent it out and be there while she does. It’s a strong possibility that just feeling like you understand will start to change her outlook."
"It sounds like she’s young and insecure. You need to talk this out with her and let her know there’s not a contest between her and your late wife. If she isn’t willing to accept that your wife is part of your history, then you need to dump her, because eventually those feelings are going to impact her relationship with your son."
"Your parents are being ASSHOLES. I’d keep up the no contact and absolutely never apologize for being yourself and an individual. Marriage is not mandatory for anyone. Life is short, live it how you want. "
"I think this is the real issue. He wanted all the stuff to come with her. He doesn’t want to plan it, shop for it, or pay for it."
"This is textbook abuse.  Nothing to do with hunger because you're even having to 'switch gears' so you dont annoy him when he's not hungry.   This will not get better, it is likely going to get worse.  Dont let yourself live like that. Best of luck"
"It sounds like you have the resources for top notch trauma therapy, which is excellent. 
There are going to be lots of challenges there will most likely be times when the kids are a bit...prickly. Everything about them will scream “I hate you and wish I didn’t live here” and when that happens, just stand strong in your support of them. I learned the hard way that when kids are the most unloveable, that’s when they need us the most. 
You are doing an amazing thing here!"
"&gt; Like she's told me the GPAs of friends (which is kind of a taboo thing to talk about at my school for whatever reason) and the details of the essays that friends have written. 

This is not just unethical, it is a serious breach of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  She is breaking the law.  When she took that job, she was undoubtedly trained in how to preserve and respect the confidential nature of the files she is accessing *for her own nosy amusement.*

This isn't just a firing offense, it's *actionable*.  She, or your university could be sued.  

&gt;I have a draft of an email to the head of the office who I'm very friendly with and knows my situation, but I feel a little gross about doing it behind her back. 

You send that email and include specific upinstances of her revealing confidential information.

This isn't you being a tattletale.  This is you *doing the right thing*, for your own integrity, for the people she has harmed, and for the good of your school.  

&gt;I'll probably tell her it was me after this is resolved.

That's unnecessary and I would advise you NOT to tell her you reported the unethical behavior.  Don't open yourself up to retaliation or recriminations.

You should not delay reporting this.  She absolutely knows she is prohibited from revealing information, and is disregarding every instruction she was given.  In most organizations that handle sensitive personal information, it is a breach to access records when there is no need to know the information.  

It seems like this woman is casually browsing through records and then gossiping about what she reads.  She is *breaking the law.*

Report it immediately."
"Your boyfriend is an embarrassing, violent, child. 

So many screaming red flags.

Get out while you can. 30 year old you is looking back in time right now and screaming at you to make the right decision here. "
"It takes 72 hours with zero food before your body even starts consuming it's own protein and it doesn't go straight to muscle...and it doesn't cause muscle pain in a few hours.  

Your husband is likely doing steroids.  And he is also incredibly verbally abusive and that has NOTHING to do with not eating.  You should not stay to be abused."
"OP, you married her knowing she was like this, you married her knowing this will be your life. 

"
"Her insecurities are not your problem in this case, they're hers.  I'm perplexed as to why you've spent all this time getting what appears to be emotionally abused.  What is she doing to fix her issues other than endlessly trying to control you?"
I don’t understand why you can’t maintain a relationship with your parents and just not invite your sister to things? 
"&gt;he tells me I can’t tell him how to live his life (which I get, and fully agree with.

I don't think you need to. He had two kids with you. He now has the responsibility to take care of his kids, and you have the right to demand that he does so. "
I think everyone here acted super maturely and at least a lot of the loose ends have been tied off because of communication. Good on you for all being mature adults here OP. It doesn't happen as often as it should.
"So ... he wants a more homey home, but he's doing nothing to make that happen? Did he fall for you, or did he fall for the nice apartment you lived in?

Next time he makes a comment, force the issue. Don't snap, don't make it an angry fight. Just tell him that you've explained already that all the ""stuff"" and home comforts of your previous place were the belongings and the effort of your roommate, and that you're not someone who puts that much effort or care into having a living room that looks like the pages of a magazine. Explain again that if he's interested in doing that, that he'll need to put that effort into it.

And then, once you've put him in his place ... meet him in the middle. Unless you're a boho freegan dumpster diver, you'll be more comfortable at home with some homey touches. Make it a team effort. Take an afternoon to flip through magazines or pinterest or something for some ideas. Talk about what you like - is your perfect living room something out of a log cabin or a midcentury modern bachelor pad? Rough out some ideas. Then figure out a budget and some priorities; if the two of you can only pull together $1,000, you can either fill the apartment for cheap or you can focus on one room and fill the rest later."
"Oh thank god, I was getting a little worried there based on some of your comments in the original post. You absolutely made the right decision. "
"It is weird timing but a kid's birthday party can be a little chaotic. I wouldn't focus on that. I'd focus on this:

&gt;  I reminded him that his family spends an order of magnitude more time with our son. He said that's only because my family doesn't care enough.

Seems like there's a bit of underlying tension about your families and that's why this bothered you so much. I think it's worth having a conversation about what he meant by that and if he really believes that. Might be worth painting a clearer picture of your respective family dynamics for context."
"Dude, just hug your wife. Bio-mom is trash. "
"My friend is black with a white husband, and their baby inherited 90% of mama's looks. He gets hassled sometimes when he's alone with the baby in public.

My friend got sick of it, and printed up business cards with a photo of the three of them and the back says ""This is my wife and daughter. I am not a kidnapper.""

So far responses have been pretty favorable. When he gives the business card to strangers they either apologize, laugh it off or get huffy/embarrassed and leave him alone.

Maybe having some similarly, humorously worded business cards to pass out to jerks would make her feel better and have the desired effect of having strangers either apologize, laugh it off or be embarrassed and leave you alone. If you can make the situation humorous, it may take some of the sting out of how badly it affects her."
"Yes you make her take the car back.

Stop blaming her father she is making these decisions.

You ignored all the financial red flags of her debt, maxed out credit cards, not respecting your budget on the wedding, she’s blowing through money and obtaining debt the entire relationship and you ignored it.

GO to a financial planner with her. You need to break down finances and show what she brings in, what goes out and work with a plan to fix it. You need to know all her debt. You need to 100% check and see if she’s opening credit cards or secretly spending money she doesn’t have.

You should also seek legal advice if she is on far more debt then you think she is. Marriage counselling a good idea too, because you can’t trust her decisions and since you’re married you’ll be held for her debt.

If all this is too much then yes you could divorce. Good luck. Don’t ignore it anymore "
"&gt;Even as a single mother I could provide them with so much more than this.

Then you know what you have to do.  

He's spending your kid's money on frivolous things, and everyone else is suffering.  It's time to put an end to that.

Consult a lawyer, get yourself a bank account, deposit YOUR checks there.  Stop letting him just take that money.  It belongs to the kids, not him."
"How does your sister treat you now?  Is she STILL awful to you?  If she is, I think that is a very valid basis for explaining why she isn't welcome around your child."
"Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama ... not :("
Just want to point out that sleeping with a fan on is quite normal- a lot of people like the sound or the breeze it makes. What isn't normal is refusing to discuss other options with her obviously uncomfortable fiancee. Some options: sleep in different rooms. Get a heated blanket where you can adjust each side differently. Make sure the fan isn't pointing on you when you sleep. Ask if she'd be willing to try a white noise app or thunderstorm sounds from spotify instead of the actual fan. 
Maybe think about sending your kids to school? Being homeschooled by your hoarding mental health issue suffering mother sounds a bit shit. 
I feel like he just emasculated himself by caring so much about making more than her. That's the sad irony here. :/
"I have three aged 11, 9, and 7 too! I teach 11-12 year olds. Give them the option to share a room at first if they want to. They may prefer to be together. It sounds like the girls will have their own bathroom, at first just stock with toiletries (deodorant, soap, shampoo, conditioner, sanitary pads--you don't need a female, just buy whatever says teen on the front) and replace as needed. Eventually they will tell you what they need. Youngest (and maybe second youngest) won't be able to wash her own hair, ask her sisters to help her. 

Give choices but only two options at a time ""Do you want spaghetti or chicken for dinner"". It values their opinion and doesn't overwhelm. Put a list on the fridge and let them add things that they need, school supplies, specific food requests, etc. 

Ask about their hobbies and make an effort to spend some quality time together early on getting to know each other and roller skating or whatever they like to do. 

Make a list of chores that you would expect them to do and ask them to help you divide it reasonably among the three of them (not on day 1). I reward mine for chores and grades with marbles in a jar, they fill the jar and get $20 to spend as they choose or can pick out something that costs that much to do as a family (it takes them 6-8 weeks to fill). Love and logic has great discipline strategies. I know that is a lot, you'll be ok. This age is fun, because they are they can communicate and they have fun interests and an actual sense of humor. Reach out to your support system, ask their teachers/counselors. Feel free to ask any questions. "
Wait until you’re comfortable telling the rest of the world. She’s going to throw a temper tantrum regardless. 
"You got two problems, but they are the same problem.

When someone says, honestly and directly, that they do want a gift, don't get them a give. hat's not respectful either. 

When your wife gives you a gift, don't mislead her and scold her like a child for spending the money.  That's not respectful either. 

You need to have a frank conversation about why how he handled that was inappropriate and really hurtful. You also need to a have a frank conversation with the person in the mirror and commit to doing a better job respecting your partner's wishes about their birthday. He's clearly not play some sort of game. You make take pride and joy is trying to give a gift, but at some point, that becomes a selfish act if he truly doesn't want to get gifts. He's not comfortable. He likes the cake. Stick to cake."
"You take the job. 

It shouldn’t even be a question if you take the job. If he wants to out earn you, he should put in the work to out earn you. 

It’s disgusting he’s willing to leave money on the table that would better your children’s lives bc he’s upset you’re better at getting money than he is. "
You guys have been dating six months and he's already trying to tell you what to do with your money. Nope.
"I think you could look at this as misaligned expectations. Apparently he’s used to being babied when he’s even remotely sick, while you’re *not* used to babying people who just have a cold. The main issue here is that he didn’t explain to you what he wanted and give you a chance to explain your perspective.

At the same time... his behavior is freaking annoying. Having a cold does not make anyone “too weak to answer a text.” He’s just having a little tantrum because you aren’t babying him the way he wants. It’s ridiculous."
"Yeah, sorry...sounds like your BF has started dating this other girl and hasn't told you yet. He's putting her above you and has even taken her on dates to places you had asked to go. 

You can do better. Let her have him."
"Maybe it's time to consider that you don't have to be with this girl specifically. Having empathy is not the same as coddling, and you can't solve other peoples problems. But this just sounds like her mistrust has caused long term alienation and you just should stop this relationship. Life is quite sucky if you can't go home and share moments in your life without arguments."
"She's the one who saw the email on his phone. I apologize for not making that clear. She's the one who confronted him and was told about the duration and who he's been seeing. 

The thing is that he's not even tried to reach out to me. Like he's fine throwing our relationship away too. Part of me is relieved and the other part of me is hurt that he hasn't cared enough to even check on me. "
"Sounds like she doesn't invite her sister.  She just comes along ""... on ocassion"" , which the parents allow in order to keep the peace. Which it seems has been a theme of OPs  life. She really does need to talk to her parents and be honest about not wanting her sister around even to keep some sort of pretence going. "
Take the job. With a husband that insecure you need to look out for yourself.
"You should stop texting these guys for her. Your own (justified) resentment aside, she’s using you as a crutch and you’re enabling her - when it’s time for her to actually engage with them in person she’s hitting a wall because she’s basically an imposter. Putting in the work of the pre-meetup should actually make it easier for her when they meet, not worse, because the connection will be more genuine. 

Not sure what to tell you about the dibs. But I would be worried that you could end up in a situation down the road if you have a long term bf that she also is attracted to and considers safe. It might be good to assert your boundaries now on principle. "
i'm like what's she got against stand up..... oh he doesn't brush his teeth ever. 
"Regardless of whether the baby is yours, do you really want to be in a relationship with her? She cheated on you, and was still in contact with the person she cheated on you with up until the moment you discovered things. That doesn’t seem like someone who’s sorry for cheating. I think if the baby is yours then you need to work out a legal custody agreement, and if he’s not then you can walk away. "
"&gt; When we first got together he told me he use to have a drinking problem, but got help and was better. But he was never as bad as the way Kate had described him. He told me that he was more of a depressed/sleep all day alcoholic, but he was never violent or drove while intoxicated. 

If he was an alcoholic at any point during his relationship with Kate, his recollection of events will be different than hers.

It is extremely concerning for an adult to regularly ""accidentally"" break things only when they are angry. I'm not sure what to think about punching himself. But together all of these behaviors are pretty concerning. I'd ask him to calmly talk to you about that interaction and his relationship history. This isn't about what she said. This is about his experiences in past relationships and reflections of past behaviors in your current relationship.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Honestly, what you're angry about here doesn't sound like an isolated incident, it sounds like you're angry about a ton of other things and this one thing is acting as a vessel for you to funnel all that anger into. 

I think he should add couple's therapy to the therapy he's already doing, to be honest with you. He has a lot of reparative work to do, and that sort of thing can actually help him as he continues to work on his depression separately."
"You can't make yourself smaller in an effort to cater to his insecurities. He's a grown man, he can deal with it."
"Sounds like she is home sick. Anyway you can fly out one of her friends for a girls weekend? Maybe hearing it from one of her fiends “OMG Mary, I would die to live here!” And just having some friend time will help her get over being home sick. 
Just a thought. "
"Text the mutual friend and say “I’m so bummed we didn’t get to hang out, bf must have gotten his wires crossed and told me we were meeting you later, I didn’t realize you would be at the cafe to watch the game! When can we get together so I can meet your bride????”"
"If he was worried about cost, perhaps he should have been more specific from the beginning. He sounds mildly controlling, which should be a concern. "
"So he got into debt by giving money to his mother (who also steals from him and demands more), he didn’t even tell you that he was expecting you to pay half your salary (!!!) toward a debt you did not accrue (which means he was planning on marrying you and *then* telling you, i.e. trapping you into it), AND he reacted with anger when you offered a compromise (an offer which by itself would have been extremely generous)?!

Run. Don’t walk. This guy is NOT worth it. "
"Reevaluate your both expenses properly again. You say she only pays rent. Who pays for food? Where are utilities? What's the fun money account? Why does it seem like it's coming from you only? Make a proper budget and adjust accordingly based on your both incomes proportionally. The one who earns more, pays slightly more that way, but both parties then have similar funds left that you both are happy to treat eachother.

What's this 'giving away shifts to spend time with you? You have two jobs, that sounds like you're away from home enough, why isn't she working then? And what hospital has enough spare nurses around that it's not a problem or causing strains with coworkers? It's a high stress job, even when one makes enough money. Those coworkers also like their own time off. Maybe that was why she didn't like them anymore, as this type of behaviour puts one on the shitlist.

She doesn't sound very nice and she doesn't seem very communicative. This was an exit she could've planned, but it was easier to 'surprise' you. Maybe there's a deeper convo needed about what she expects from living together and what your final goal together is and timelines and such. You moved in together relatively fast.
"
"I believe her.  I would react the same way if my abusive rapist ex came up to me in public like that.  He always denied the violent rape he committed against me and the years of stalking.  Half my friends believed me, half believed him.  He is now married with two kids and I heard from a friend that she had called police twice now after 11 years of him ""behaving"".  I would never trust him ever and you bet I would call him out if he ran into me and acted as if nothing happened and tried to corner me into polite conversation for his sick purposes.

Just the sight of him caused her to panic.  Then he proceeded to try to force her to deny his treatment of her by telling her how to feel (ot was a long time ago, you should be over it).  He gaslighted her in public to control her.  If she was indeed the crazy ex he would not have approached her, but he saw an opportunity to control her again and took it.  He probably wanted to put her on her back foot so she wouldn't tell you the truth.  But she did, and he went into full denial and accuse mode and now won't discuss it.

She wasn't lying and you've seen hints of his tendencies.  I would be terrified if I were you."
"I mean, it sounds like you'd be less lonely living alone than staying in this marriage. "
"&gt;I tried talking to him about maybe just doing a quick sweep or something and he claims I'm the only one who cares and is making the mess. He doesn't care about a clean bathroom. His clothes aren't everywhere because I've been folding all of it along with my laundry. So he says when I am cleaning, I'm only doing it for myself because he doesn't care for a clean place. Our place looks messy because he just throws his clothes on the floor.

This is turning into a cold war of, ""Well I don't care about how messy it gets, so you have to clean."" So what are you supposed to do, just stop doing all the chores until it gets unbearable enough for him  that he will pitch in and do his share? He is being manipulative and forcing you into a no-win situation, and he knows it. Really, this sounds like an awful living dynamic, and if it's only been a few months, I would expect it to get worse. Really, he is not trying to solve the problems you guys are having, but is only trying to make things easier for himself. That's not what a good partner does. Start to think about getting out of there."
"Don't get pregnant by him. 

There are far too many problems in your marriage for you to bring another child into this situation. 

I'm married myself and I'm pro marriage and trying to save marriages under difficult circumstances. However your husband just seems to be a cruel person and I don't see how you can stay married to someone who treats you like this. 

According to your post he

* makes fun of you (humiliates) you in front of his own children for asking for good behaviour from them
* complains and makes cruel jokes about you crying because you are not yet pregnant with the baby you want
* upsets you and lets you down just before an event that is important to you and leaves you hanging without knowing if he is going to attend or not
* puts you down with statements like 'I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand
* does nothing around the house and doesn't care to help even though you've brought it up before and were ill today

These are all big red flags that he is moving into the territory of emotionally abusive behaviour. I personally feel that when a person crosses that line and shows no remorse, which he appears not to have done, that a marriage is basically unsalvageable. 

I understand that getting out of this marriage is going to be painful for you in a lot of ways, partly because you want a baby so much and partly because you are clearly attached to his children. But do you really want to go on living like this? Have a child and see that child have to put up with being treated like this too?"
"Okay - wait. When he approached and she freaked out, why didn't y'all back off?  This right here screams to me that he was abusive to her.  If he cared about her and her comfort at all, y'all wouldn't have been standing there the entire time the ex was packing up.

"Yeah, I don't think it means he expected OP to be a homemaker; it just sounds like he's picky but also cheap."
"Does your mom know about the affair yet? If not, she deserves to know. You are potentially damaging your relationship with your mom by keeping this a secret from her. 

Take some time and get some distance from this situation for a bit. Really think about what you would need to rebuild your relationship for your dad and if you think that it would even be possible. Let your dad know what you would need from him for him to keep you in your life and see if he's able to follow through. "
"\#1: I have NEVER met a miserable cat lady. I have met some grumpy ones, but generally they are grumpy because they have to go in public, and deal with humans, not cats.  
\#2: What is so fantastic about your dad, that is family should be spread far and wide. Also, does he not get how it works? You would traditionally be having children that take their father's last name, so it would not longer be your dad's family expanding.  
\#3: Do you know how many old people, rotting in nursing homes, are there because their children put them there?  Quite a few. Usually because the person expected their children to take care of them when they got old.  


You have nothing to apologize for, because you did nothing wrong.  If they can't accept you, that is on them.  
I would suggest you start building a family of your choosing, because your real family seems really crummy.  I am sorry. There is nothing wrong with who you are."
"If he doesn’t understand your reasoning while having a conversation, then try cold, harsh, horrible math. Put it all on paper - income, expenses, percentages, etc. Maybe seeing it physically written down will help him take in and understand what you are trying to say? "
"Was in a similar situation. Turned out the guy DID have an open Don't Ask Don't Tell relationship - the wife was fine with it and saw other people too (found this out months later) but the difference was when I told the man that I didn't want to proceed without confirmation I wasn't party to cheating, he said ""Yeah I get that. I'd want proof too, that's why this kind of arrangement can be difficult. We're both fine with knowing we see others but the details make us both insecure if we know them. It's one thing to say ""I have a date"", another to put a face to it and wonder if that person is better. I hope this hasn't damaged our friendship. I won't suggest anything more again"" and he DIDN'T and we're still friends.

Open or not this guy is an abusive asshole. You did the right thing. 

Even though you aren't in the wrong, if you really think he'll escalate at the party, avoid it to keep YOURSELF safe and sane."
"It sounds like your grandmother is quite neglected. She apparently can't take care of herself and your grandfather doesn't have the time/enough help. So she should either be moved to a care home or there should be more intense contact with a nurse to help her at her home. Maybe she needs to have physical therapy too, so she can get up to wash her hands. So talk to the doctor too. Grandma likely feels embarrassed and lonely, she's not going to be the one who's going to ask for help actively. 

This is not really something to get an opinion on from the patient or her carer. It's a lot more matter of fact and someone has to tackle this. Get your familymembers together and make a plan. Grandpa is included. It's about practicalities, he knows best how things are done. But that also means that he is the one in power and thus the one who has to be confronted that he's not doing things sufficiently. Your family should figure out who can stand with him and be around grandma more to physically help out or communicate with the carers or who can take the time to check out care homes.

Your grandma needs help. Do help her. If no one does anytime soon, you should call Adult Protective Services. "
"The dead bedroom is the much bigger issue here.

You've only been dating for 6 months, it has been a dead bedroom for the last 3, and it is long distance?

I think you need to move on..."
"You've been together over a year. It's not weird, just put it on his head and say, ""i need you to reload this with your smell because I like it.""

Own the quirk. "
You are like 2 inch away from disaster. Stop talking to them.
Ask what she wants? Making unilateral decisions about things that effect the both of you is just not good. You simply need to ask what she wants rather than assuming you know. As for 'making it up to her': good actions don't erase bad ones. Apologize to her for your specific actions and make a concentrated effort to change. Not repeating the event will be the only thing that really makes it up to her.
"My husband is HUGE on doing things together as a family. It is very important to him. So that is why I was so shocked and hurt when he went off to do his own thing. 

I brought this up to him last night and he agreed that doing things together is important to him, but he only feels that way about his family. Not mine. 

And this is what hurt me most in the moment. I knew that if the tables were turned he'd be very upset if I did this to him. He agreed last night that he would be mad at me. I felt like his behavior was blatant favoritism. "
"That's a good idea about pushing the issue next time it comes up. And saying I'm not like my roommate, I don't really have the same interest in home making.

As for what my perfect room would be like, it's actually very close to how it is now. I love windows that let in a lot of natural light, and have a nice view outside, which we have. I like big cushy couches and comfortable furniture, to have friends over, which we have. I like a cozy place to read, with a little bookshelf whi5 we have. 

I guess the one thing that I'd want in addition is stuff that reminds me of good times. Like knicknacks or art collected when traveling, gifts exchanged with friends and family, etc. And that stuff will take time to collect together, it's not something you can pick up at Ikea in a weekend haha.

Maybe I'll ask him if he'd like to go to one of our city's art fairs and pick something unique out together."
"I think people are jumping to call your sister a bridezilla

I think she just wants the same treatment as her sister

Maybe her mom and grandmother do pay more attention to her

We don't know that the sister is going to be vindictive and honestly its a really crummy upsetting thing to have happen to you even without the history involved

No one wants to plan a special day to celebrate their love to find out most people are going to be more invested in something else at the time even if its for a valid reason

I think empathy is the key here

OP needs to start with I realize this is hurtful to you because of your experiences. Please understand this was an accident and I wasn't trying to get pregnant before your wedding. You are my sister and I love you.

"Yep. This is a classic ""it's not really about the broccoli"" post, only from the other point of view.  It's not about the stand-up. It's about literally everything else. "
"I knew this was going in a bad direction when he's all super cheery and approaches the ex and she's freaking out.  Instead of leaving, cuz she's clearly uncomfortable, *he continues to instigate and is literally gas lighting her in front of you.*  I mean...he was telling her how to feel in front of you!  

&amp;#x200B;

I believe everything she says because of that.  But then add in:

&gt;  she’s just a crazy drama queen who wants attention. 

Come on OP....this is the oldest line in the book!  And if she's such a crazy drama queen....*why the fuck did he approach her instead of avoiding her!!!!!*"
Wow. Wtf? This is would be a hard no for me. This is clearly moving past a friend situation. No one in a relationship should be up at 3AM hiding in the bathroom talking to their “friend”. This is moving fast towards cheating. Let’s just be honest. You guys have no boundaries regarding that? It’s time to create some clear and hard ones and enforce them or gtfo of the relationship. Its so obvious where this is going.
"Please frame this in your mind as something that you can control.  Where people go wrong IMO is when they act like crushes are a force of nature and fall back on tired cliches like “the heart wants what the heart wants” and “it was destiny that threw us together.”  No.  Adults get crushes.  They acknowledge them, enjoy a fantasy or two, put boundaries in place and move on.

If you need or want to break up with your boyfriend and this makes you acknowledge it, do so.  But OP, PLEASE don’t be that cliche of the honewrecker coworker who can’t stop screwing around in the workplace.  He’s got a relationship too, and you said he hasn’t shown any sign of realizing or reciprocating your feelings.  Don’t make a fool of yourself.  Set boundaries and move on. "
"My god your family is a real piece of work. They’ll disown you if you’re not married or engaged within a year?  In my opinion, a year isn’t even long enough to know if you want to be with someone the rest of your life. So I guess they’d rather you be married and miserable than single and happy. 

They obviously have zero respect for you and, to be candid, I wouldn’t associate myself with people like that, family or not. "
"Muscles swell while working out and will lose some bulk afterwards.  He has muscle pain because he works out and lactic acid builds up.  He is not losing gains from missing two days...that is not possible.  This sounds more and more like steroids.  

But none of that excuses his abuse of you.  My husband used to be a professional MMA fighter and still trains intensely.  You bet he is hungry sometimes or in pain from working out.  And yet...he never ever EVER abuses me.  Stop babying him, start expecting him to feed himself, and tell him that his verbal abuse stops immediately or you are leaving.  And he is an utter idiot for ingesting Russian made supplements he can't even read the label of."
"Omg I just saw that YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF THE PERSON IN THE HOSPITAL

The person doesn't exist. You are allowing squatters to take over your home.

Kick them out IMMEDIATELY. Like, this second.

You say your husband is in full agreement with you, so seriously. Do it now. What's the hold up?

This is fucking outrageous. "
"Also, GET OFF FACEBOOK. It's a goddamn dumpster fire and you'll both feel better if you never get on it again, I promise. "
"This is wild, honestly. Just throw the whole man out. Rock those painted nails! "
"He only logged out and deleted the apps so that he can keep those contacts when he logs back in. They're not gone, they're an install away."
Too weak to respond to a text? How dramatic. 
"It's only been 6 months and IMO this is red flag behaviour.

I do agree with him that you are enabling your brother, and trying to manage relationships that you are not even involved in is almost always going to be a losing situation. That being said, the way your bf dictated the terms of the future to you doesn't sound great, and I simply would not stand for it."
"you did everything to be as honest and empathetic as possible.

he's really coming across as shady and manipulative. as for his wife... maybe there's a lot to unfold in their relationship. good thing you are out from the get go. stay out.

as for the party, absolutely don't feel awkward wtf. it's all on him. go with your head held high as you did the right thing. he should be the one ashamed of his attitude, even if you're in the wrong. stay with people you know just in case he gets drink and feels aggressive. "
"Haha, sorry. I was really grasping at straws to see if *anyone* would indulge my hopeless romantic side and recommend that I stay."
"I'm just going to toss this out since it's so similar of a situation.

I have hip length dark red hair.  If I wear it down it gets everywhere.  It is a microfiber loving parasite and will attach to any static surface.  All you have to do is brush by me when its down and voila!  You have a 4 ft long red hair attached to you.

One day I came to work to open up and one of my employees was sleeping in his car in the parking lot.  His girlfriend had kicked him out because she'd found one of my hairs on their couch.  

It's entirely possible it's something like that.  "
"Just go no contact with your sister. That's it. Tell your parents you are no contact, and that they are still invited to things but they aren't to bring her.

If your parents can't respect that very simple boundary, then your parents don't get to be a part of your life either. 

I'd set my expectations rock bottom if I were you. Your parents sound to be an active part of the problem with enabling your sister's behavior, and I wouldn't expect that to change just because you start implementing some sterner boundaries. They are very likely to choose her, because they seem to have wrapped their identities up in soothing her fits."
"So the only problem I see here is that you literally have no idea where your GF stands on when you two should get married. I think you're definitely in the clear as far as this trip goes, but maybe if you've been dating for 1.5 years and you see a future with her, it couldn't hurt to have that conversation. Your coworkers are only making you feel insecure because you literally have no clue what your GF is thinking. Getting on the same page as a couple can only improve your relationship, anyway :) Just talk about it!"
"Best answer. Seriously my husband and I are doing the whole ""baby names"" thing and the FIRST rule we made was both of us get automatic veto power over any name. Period. No if's, and's or but's. If the name is not a ""hell yes"" from both people it's a ""not in this lifetime.""

I've had my husband turn down some names, if I'm being honest, that I really REALLY love and actually felt major disappointment over him saying ""no"" to. Know what my reaction was? ""Ah man you really don't like (name)? Ok what about (other name)?""

I, too, have ix-nayed  him on some names he likes. He shrugs and asks if I want wings for dinner. The point is, if neither partner loves the name, the name should be a no. Both parents should love and agree to the name of their offspring and both parents need to have flexibility and a sense of humor about this. 

If my husband was acting like OP's a$$face of a husband I not only would be crossing my legs hard core I would be reassessing staying in my marriage. This kind of inflexibility and unwillingness to compromise make for being a piss poor father. I would know since my old man was inflexible and unwilling to compromise. A true ""it's my way or the high way"" type of man. He was a horrible dad and an even worse husband. 

OP make no bones about it and tell your husband straight that he is displaying some extremely unattractive traits right now that is making you question your willingness to have a family with and stay in a marriage with him. You can be blunt without being nasty. Tell him this discussion is over, period, no child of yours will *ever* have his dad's name as a first name and if he doesn't like it then don't let the door hit him on the way out.

This is absolutely a hill to die on, because this issue is a strong indication of something much more sinister for the future. Having kids can really bring out the inner asshole in someone. I typically hate the whole ""get counseling for every little problem under the sun"" culture we live in, but in this case, couples therapy might actually be in order."
"Ok so there's a lot going on here. First of all, you and your boyfriend should have communicated so much better about this stuff before moving in- who was bringing what and how new things would picked and styled etc. Secondly, it's not automatically the woman's job to make a house feel like a home- not every woman is amazing at that stuff and shouldn't have to be- if he has a problem with how the house feels, HE can decorate it and put in the effort. If your bf doesn't get that then he's more than a little sexist and I'd seriously reconsider the relationship. Do you want to live with someone who expects you to be his mom? "
"It is pretty shitty that if I want to tell her a story about my day I have to give so much other background information (who everybody is, how often I see them, if I've mentioned them before, if they are cute). So usually I just...don't tell her things. Which then makes me a liar because I'm omitting information. She also gets pretty pissed when we're out with friends and I tell them a story she hasn't heard before. But NOBODY ELSE ASKS A BILLION QUESTIONS WHEN I TELL THEM STORIES."
"Your list of concerns is completely valid! Forget what your friends are telling you - this isn't about them and it isn't their life. Only you know what's right for your life.

If you need more time, that's great. Take that time and work it out. 

There are two books that were helpful for me. ""Maybe Baby"" and ""The Baby Decision"". I suggest both you and your husband read them and start connecting on where you are in your mutual feelings."
"BINGO! Exactly my first thought. Who treats anyone a gift not letting them have any contextual clues (price, destination, time frame, name of company to book with) to work with? No one, that's who! 

He could have *easily* made this work. Like three sentences work. ""Oh babe, that's a little more than I intended on spending, I was thinking like $X.  How about another island (there's more than just Jamaica and Aruba)? We are gonna have such an awesome time!""

But that would mean actually getting you a gift, and not just bragging rights for a trip he isn't intending to give you. Because making it all your fault and clutching his pearls is the easiest way for him to blame-shift and wiggle out of this. Sounds like a loser.

"
"&gt;We have been dating for just over 6 months. Head over heels in love, **have known for a couple of years** and timing was just right over the summer for us to start hanging out

....so he's currently 31 and you're 21. If you've ""known for a couple years"" that you two were interested in each other, *that means a man in his late 20's was grooming a teenager for a relationship.* Grooming is the key word there.

And what do you know? He's now repeatedly violating a physical boundary of yours *for no reason other than to bother you.* That's what predators and abusers do: slowly start violating your boundaries until you're in too deep to leave.

/.I attempt to play it off most of the time, but sometimes will not hold back or regret getting close to kicking him to get off. In a **playing wrestle rough housing way.**

That is especially concerning: this is already getting physical. He is already demonstrating that he doesn't respect your boundaries. And he's done everythign a predator would do to groom a teenager to date an abuser who's a decade older.

I'm willing to bet there are a lot of other red flags in this relationship and his behavior. 

"
"Stop dating people you work with, dude!! "
Dude this sounds miserable.
I definitely think it your best bet at staying is if she has a job too. She needs regular interaction with other adults so she can form friendships. Friendships are super important to some of us. I would suggest she start looking now so she has a more balanced view by the time your contract is up for renewal. Good luck to you and your family. 
"Put a freeze on your credit.  They probably know your social security number and this will limit the damage they can do to you.     

Stay firm.  You're in a horrible spot, but just realize that they needed to learn how to manage finances properly and that this house of cards will all eventually come crashing down around them.  And that you are not responsible for any of it.  And give yourself a break for when you were 17, you were a minor and didn't know what to do in a complex situation."
"This sounds like a situation where it would be more appropriate to talk to her about behaviour as it comes up than to confront her with a long list and ""you always do these things and need to change"". For instance when she says something rude to a whole group, say something offhand that shows you disagree or disapprove, or when you're alone gently tell her how that specific thing she said came across. Don't do it every time but on the things that bother you the most."
"&gt; You fixing food for him is a privilege that he should be grateful for.

Yep. Why is it OPs responsibility to make sure he is fed properly so that he doesn't yell at her? Bunch of bullshit that is.

OP, the fact that he is hungry and in pain is no excuse for the way he is treating you. You need to get that in check real quick. Make it clear to him that you understand that he is hungry and in pain, but that doesn't give him the right to take it out on you. Nor is it your responsibility to fix his problem, he is perfectly capable of feeding himself, and if you're going to be kind enough to do it then he should be nothing but appreciative.

And, I'm not saying this is guaranteed to happen, but what if one day during one of these episodes of ""hanger"" he hits you? Because unfortunately that's where this kind of behavior leads a lot of the time. You are not his punching bag, physically nor verbally. Just because he's not feeling well is no reason at all for him to take it out on you. If you don't address this with him it will lead to resentment and bigger problems in your marriage."
"This is literally the premise of a Seinfeld episode where George falls in love with a woman for her velvet furniture but when he moves in with her he finds out it belonged to her roommate. 

Also, if you’re boyfriend acts anything like George Costanza you may have a problem on your hands. Show him the episode to see what he thinks of it from a third person perspective and that George (he) is being a jerk."
"He's abusive. Also, is the man incapable of making his own damn sandwich instead of ordering you around like you're his waitress?"
"Did you report it yet? - sincerely, everyone."
"I don’t think Mr. Swag has the hots for your bf. I bet he’s just a douche-y guy who thinks your boyfriend’s life is over now that he’s in a relationship and probably mocks him for it (hence the whatsapp stuff). Also considering they’re high school best friends, he probably expects a certain level of attention from your boyfriend (which will fizzle out whenever the hell this guy decides to grow up). I say wait him out. "
"Honestly you two sound fundamentally incompatible in terms of living together. He doesn’t make any logical sense. You like things a little cleaner than he does, that is totally fine and not at all uncommon in a relationship. So you do a little more of the cleaning because the mess makes you uncomfy (fair, you aren’t nagging him to clean it sounds like) and he complains because your very reasonable and helpful solution means things aren’t exactly 50/50? This is insane. I don’t even know how to advise you to speak to him about this because it’s so insane. Good luck. This isn’t going to end well if he can’t understand why this is crazy, he needs therapy. "
"She started therapy today, good for her but if you stick around much longer in this soul-destroying vortex of blackness masquerading as a relationship, you'll be needing therapy too."
"How many people are willing to bet this trip is not going to happen and boyfriend will claim it's because of OP. Raise your hand.

If OP wants to split the costs he will refuse.
If OP suggests another destination he will refuse.

Boyfriend wants to talk the talk but really wasn't going to walk the walk.  "
"Continually accusing you of being a liar without any other reason than her insecurity that you did not cause is emotional abuse.  It actively undermines your self esteem and creates turmoil.  Not taking constant active steps to avoid treating your poorly because someone in her past treated her poorly is abusive.  We all come with baggage.  We do not come with any rights to mistreat those we love because of it.

You are not 'helping' your SO, you're enabling her.  The insecurity will not be fixed if you just go one more step to prove your fidelity because this isn't about you.  You can't fix what you didn't break.

I came from a pretty abusive childhood where my mother lied about everything all the time.  When I started dating, I was hyper alert to people lying to me.  I'm actually pretty good at catching it.  I had to, however, do some serious self reflection on how much I held people accountable to standards that were totally unfair.  It was a lot of the time.  It wasn't fair.  That was my problem to fix."
"I agree! If you have to wait 4-5 hours to hear back from him and he is hiding in the bathroom to text her back right away, he's already one foot out the door. "
"&gt;  I said that it seems unfair to the kids. He said that hey life is unfair and I’m just teaching them a lesson. He goes on to say that hey, you can make up new rules if you want and let them watch TV, but just know that he can make up new rules too and that there is no end to what he’s willing to do (which seemed like a threat to me). As if to prove a point, he found our son crying softly and told him that for crying, he gets no TV for a month. And then he turns to me and says, now that’s unfair but this is what you get for making me mad. And for the first time ever, I though, I don’t know if this marriage will make it. 

What the actual fuck. That is INSANE. It's crazy to me that you say he has been good about having a conversation about conflicts for over twenty years, and now he turns into basically a sadistic monster who punishes children for crying. That's so extreme! If this is new he should go get a medical checkup. I have heard that extreme and sudden personality changes can have a medical cause sometimes, but I'm not a medical professional so I can't speculate or anything, I just think that's a good move.

Other than that, he needs a come to Jesus talk. He needs to understand that punishing *you* for a little accident is unacceptable, that punishing your kids to get back at you is unacceptable, and that setting expectations with your kids and then pulling the rug out from under them DOES NOT teach them that life isn't fair. **It teaches them that home is not safe, and that their dad can't be depended on.** 

I don't understand why he went and fixed the ps4 instead of just letting you do it. Most conflicts have some wrong on both sides, but this entire issue from start to finish is 100% his fault. Tell him that he is calling his doctor and making an appointment right now, or you are taking the kids to a friend's house because he's not a fit parent right now."
"It seems like you've accorded this woman, and your relationship with her, some kind of mythical status in your life. You're continuing to live your life almost as a reaction to this transformative moment. It's understandable, but it's also quite limiting, and ties your past like an anchor around your present and future. 

Lily is neither an angel, nor a demon. She's just a woman who loved you, and then wasn't sure, and ultimately ended the relationship in ways that hurt you both. That sucks, but... relationships end. Even ones that were once good, even ones where there is a lot of love. Relationships end, and people hurt each other, but it doesn't make the whole relationship a lie, and it doesn't doom every relationship that comes after it unless *you* let it by continuing to give it this power over you.

Stop debating her motivations - you will never truly 100% know what she was thinking, or how she felt at any given moment, or how much she regrets her actions, etc. Don't drive yourself crazy, and don't chase clarity that you can't have and which may or may not help even if you could have it. Likewise, stop debating with yourself over whether you made the right decision. Instead, just accept that a decision was made - you stuck to your guns when a lot of people would have folded, and there are likely good reasons for that. The decision is made, and is in the past. Leave it there, and focus on your future.

You mention that you've seen therapists and haven't found it helpful, but maybe you should try again. Speak to a few until you find a right fit. Consider someone who is familiar with CBT, and work to reset the thought loop that carries you back again and again to this painful event that offers you no clarity. You don't owe this relationship, or the break up, the mental real estate you're giving it right now. Don't spend another 2 years looking back."
"I get it. My husband is a horrible cook. He gets home at 4:30pm and I get home at 6pm. As soon as I get home I start on dinner so we can eat at a decent time. My husband's ""night"" is Wednesday when he picks up sushi. 

It's frustrating to be the cook. But he handles all of the daily chores. Trash, recycling, dishes and taking care of the dogs. My rule is that the kitchen has to be ready for me to immediately start cooking. Nothing in the sink, emptied dishwasher, empty trash/recycling and clean work space. This makes it much easier to be the cook.

You either have to to reshuffle chores so it's not a burden on you or, accept his mediocre cooking and let him help. You can just keep cooking for yourself but it seems like it's going to cause from friction that can be solved other ways."

"You can't continue to subject your children to this environment. He will take food out of their mouths until they ""leave the nest"" with so much resentment of you BOTH that you might just permanently lose them. Now they're too young to understand what's happening, but trust me, as they get older they WILL understand that they can't have school activities, or new clothes, or even a decent CHristmas, because Dad is the only one allowed to have those things. and why? Well, the obvious answer is that Dad is the only one that matters. Your own sense of self-worth is dwindling because of how he treats you--what are the long-term ramifications for your children? Will they have lower self-esteem because every single day they are reminded that they are second-class citizens? Will your son treat HIS future wife and family this way because of this terrible role model? How about your own resentment? How much more of this bitter anger can you abide in your heart before you snap? 

You only have $50 to your name because he knows if youare financially dependent on him, you won't leave. As far as he is concerned, you are not his partner, you are his domestic servant, and the paltry sum he pays you to be his servant is worth it. He doesn't have a sense of responsibility towards you or obligation towards your children because you are his wench and one day the kids will be able to pull their weight in the household, becoming his mini-slaves. 

Find your way out of his mess, for your sake and for the sake of your children. The only way he will be financially responsible is if the courts make him pay alimony and child support..."
"Your son is definitely going to need to have the freedom to talk about his mother.  Your late wife is an important part of your life and always will be, and your girlfriend is out of line.

UMM YES REPORT HER. This is a massive massive breach.
"Also, selling a functional car, paying off student loans w/that money, then taking out a NEW load for a NEW CAR is 1000% crazy town. Nobody who has any money sense would ever recommend such a stupid thing. Unless she happens to have had one of the extremely rare sort of cars that INCREASE in value, that is not a thing you toss out and replace in an attempt to SAVE MONEY. "
You've been dating this guy for two months and he lied about his entire life. You have a child to be a role model to. Find someone better than a pathological liar.
"Okay, don't spend your last days of freedom before starting a job hiding because you are afraid of running into an ex. Trust me when you work for 49 weeks with 3 weeks off, you will curse yourself for not taking advantage of all the free time you had back when life was simpler. "
"I think you need to talk to him about it again. You would BOTH benefit from the higher-paying job. In fact, the whole family would benefit. The only thing holding you all back from this great opportunity is his delicate male ego.

Has he always been sexist like this? It doesn't even make sense, he's *not* the sole breadwinner right now... you both are winning bread. "
"u/PixelCurls about your W-2, you said that every other employee you asked had received your W-2? But you said that you Mom told you they didn't get it yet? That is very important... They probably DID receive your W-2 but, with their penchant for fraud, are probably going to use it to fraudulently receive your tax returns. First thing I would do is IMMEDIATELY call your employer and have them update your mailing address. Then go to your mother's house unannounced to get your W-2. 

Also, call the police. Or at least their lender. What they're trying to do is illegal. "
"He wasn't engaging in BDSM. He was simply physically abusing you during sex.

"&gt;Getting 3-4 hrs of sleep a night, picking up/taking boyfriend and daughter daily.

3-4 hours of sleep a night is dangerously little sleep. 

I'm rather passionate about this topic because I'm an insomniac and in a lot of ways, sleep is my enemy. Or rather, lack of sleep + bad sleep are my enemies. 

When people talk about taking care of themselves, they invariably talk about eating healthily and exercising, but *the most impactful thing you can do for your health is get 7+ hours of good sleep*. Period. 

Drowsy driving is akin to tipsy driving. Would you ever get behind the wheel with your daughter after having a few beers?

&gt;Drowsy driving is estimated to be a factor in 20 percent of fatal crashes. A new study from AAA states that drivers who skimp on the seven hours of sleep experts recommend increase their risk of a crash exponentially. Missing one to two hours of sleep doubles a driver’s crash risk, while foregoing two or three hours increases the risk of a crash by 400 percent, according to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study. Those who sleep for less than four hours in a 24-hour period are 11.5 times likelier to crash, the study showed.

I'm not saying this to pile on you, but to give you a wake up call. "
"Your mom has a lot of expectations about how your life is going to go, and you took the reins away from her and in her disappointment she decided to grab them back and do what she wanted because she knows better than everyone. That's not really a safe way to maintain adult relationships. 

You don't need your parents to sort your life anymore, and it doesn't sound like they were ready to hear that. Instead your mom did and said some hurtful things, and your dad backs you in to a corner to guilt you and enable her. It sounds like your mom has been really torn up about you starting your own family and hasn't found a productive way to share these feelings with you. She's probably taking it out on your dad, who in turn just wants you back under her thumb to keep the peace.

They aren't going to get help or even admit they are wrong. I suggest you and your new wife discuss what the boundaries are for your new family unit and uphold them together. What place do you want your parents to have in your adult life? What are the consequences for them stepping over the line? Communicate these to them clearly or your mother will continue to steamroll you and your decisions."
"Do you know what’s not normal? Cheating on your wife with your boss. 

Don’t worry about if your actions are right or wrong or normal or not. Your dad is the one who is wrong and abnormal. How you deal with his wrong and hurtful actions is now your prerogative. He is not entitled to a “normal” or “fair” response from you. This is now about your grief and what’s best for you.  

Will going no contact help or hurt your grieving process? No contact does not have to be permanent. It can be temporary until you feel ready to hash things out with him. "
"&gt; We don't have sex enough and I know that is a huge contributing factor...but I don't think that is ever going to change. He doesn't like sex and that's why his relationship with her ended in the first place. I put up with it. Others dont.

This is an extremely telling sentence. Either you're lying to yourself or don't see it. By ""putting up with it"" the issue is manifesting itself with jealousy, frustration, resentment, etc? Are you prepared to endure this for the entirety of your relationship? "
"&gt; I brought this up to him last night and he agreed that doing things together is important to him, but he only feels that way about his family.

This is a couples counseling - worthy issue.  "

"*You* don't know social rules? The last time I checked, if you're giving someone the gift of a trip, you *do all the legwork yourself* and then present them with an itinerary.

What he wanted was the feel-good blast of endorphins and adoration that's comes from being the generous, loving boyfriend. 

Now he gets to enjoy feeling like a put upon martyr for a girlfriend who doesn't truly appreciate them.

Is this really what you want? "

Nobody else seems to be noting that your root cause might not require a breakup. 

Have you communicated with your SO that you need space? Truly communicated that you feel stressed, that you need more lone time to focus in college, etc. Whether or not she responds well, I think the conversation would be a valuable lesson for you in asserting your needs with a partner."
"Yes, one of the reasons why our parents won't come without her is the fact that she tells them they're picking a side or trying to cut her off. Going to my parents' house is also a issue sometimes as she complains that she isn't able to enjoy their company on her own. I know her logic doesn't make a lot of sense but it is how it is. "
"&gt;As if to prove a point, he found our son crying softly and told him that for crying, he gets no TV for a month.

Your husband is causing permanent psychological harm to your children with his actions.

If you care about your kids, you need to get them out of there. Separate from your husband, get a lawyer, and tell him you'll consider coming home once he's been in therapy for his anger issues for at least three months.

&gt;he is pretty scary when he’s angry.

Yeah. He's abusing you guys."
"&gt; We’ve been here for nearly 2 weeks now, and I’ve spent each day with his family. I don’t tag along when he goes out with friends though, because he hasn’t seen them in a year so I’m giving him space.

I'm sorry, wtf. You stay home, in a foreign country, while he goes out with friends. THIS SHIT IS WEIRD AND NOT NORMAL AND FUCKING RUDE. Why doesn't he want you to hang out with him and his friends. I cannot even imagine my husband doing this."
"&gt;The thing is that he's not even tried to reach out to me. Like he's fine throwing our relationship away too. Part of me is relieved and the other part of me is hurt that he hasn't cared enough to even check on me.

Other people are saying he's embarrassed, and maybe that's part of it. But the guy got himself into this situation because we was thinking about only himself first."
"&gt;Later he apologized for yelling at me but not for his violent outburst. He claims he was only protecting me.     



Protecting you from what, exactly? A pleasant conversation with someone who wasn't doing anything wrong?    


I've always said that a *little* bit of jealousy is to be expected in a relationship and I would even argue that, in small enough doses, is healthy. To an extent, we all want our partner to desire us and to care enough about us that they are willing to fight (figuratively) for our affections.    


But your boyfriend sounds like a borderline psychopath and his behaviour is inexcusable. Nothing more to say.    


If you don't leave him, there's a good chance that his ""passion"" (or violent temper) will be turned on YOU at some point. This is not healthy.  "
"Okay, a few separate things:

1.) Yes, your bf wanting to control your money is a HUGE red flag.

2.) Paying for your brother and his gf to go to your sister's graduation is something you are free to do.

3.) You are not responsible for making sure the relationship between your brother and your sister doesn't get ruined. He is a grown man who makes his own choices. She is a grown woman who reacts how she is going to react. Just because you are the eldest does not make it your job to maintain their relationship for them.

"
"Right?! He doesn't get to ""help"" her. They're his own damn kids. If my husband ever even insinuated that I needed to ask him for help to parent our girls I would lose my shit. He sounds like someone who clearly doesn't enjoy spending time with his kids, and sees it as a chore."
"&gt;I've also been cheated on before, 

And you are being cheated on now.  Your boyfriend thinks he's single and is now pursuing another woman.  Not all jealously is unreasonable.   In this case, your supposed boyfriend has made it clear that he's not committed to you and wants to date someone else.

Stop trying to be a ""cool"" girlfriend.  Just tell him that he's no longer your boyfriend and start looking for someone who actually wants to be with you."
"I had a teacher once who would tell this hysterical story about waiting for an elevator, and when the doors opened this old couple walked out and as they were passing, the woman said, ""It's not the casserole Harold, it's the last 50 years.""

This definitely feels like a recipe for that statement a few decades down the line."
Sounds like she did you a favor. 
"You need to make comments when she says it does this that gently reinforce that you are Aunt, not mom. Like, ""I'm so proud to be your aunt!"""
"&gt;  and sent Eileen the screenshot along with the texts ""rein in ya boiiii"" and ""hoooooly shit i am sic of hearing this bullshit from every wrankly ol asshat in mechE""

This is the most hilarious thing I've ever read on r/relationships. 10/10.

On a serious note, I think what you did was completely excusable given the situation. You didn't choose to receive Bob's sleazy, creepy and offensive proposition during your own free time. Despite having every excuse, though, the drunken message to Eileen was definitely regrettable. 

I'd say an apology for phrasing and message delivery may be in order, but that's all. I'd also prepare for the scenarios in which she:

* Denies the evidence and tries to paint you as a liar

* Irrationally blames you for trying to seduce her husband. Remember that Bob is going to be in 100% weasel mode rn and will be spinning lies as fast as he can to escape blame, probably at your expense

* Doesn't know about the message. As others have said, Bob may have tried to damage control by deleting evidence from her phone"
"This comment is everything I needed to hear. I’ve decided I’m ending things next week. I can’t sit by and watch this happen to my kids. We all deserve so much better than this. 

He even talks about the day my son can work so he doesn’t have to. My son is 18 months. He seemed to be joking but yeah I don’t think he is actually. "
"Um, why are you only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night?"
"How does half the mortgage compare to half the cost of renting a similar amount of space in your area? If they are roughly comparable, then there's nothing wrong with paying half the mortgage and utilities as your rent.

However, since you're a renter, your BF should ve paying the house insurance, taxes, and maintenance.  You shouldn't be paying half of a new water heater, for instance."
"Honestly, this has more to do with your fiance's dad than his step mom. If he can't see through her terrible behavior and be there for his son on one of the most important days of his life, then he doesn't deserve the privilege of being there. Your step mom knows how much your fiance wants his dad there, and is using him against you guys, but your father has the power to not allow himself to be used as a pawn in the step moms game.

He will regret not being at his sons wedding for the rest of his life, more than you and your fiance will regret keeping a woman away who would most certainly try and ruin said day...to the best of her ability."
"She seems really insecure. And you might think this is uncommon, but it isn't. too much pressure to be relevant on social media these days. My only advise would be to tell your husband. Not as a report her to him sort of thing, but just as something you stumbled upon. See his reaction. Other than that, I don't see much else you should do. "
Your edit. This sounds a lot worse than I originally thought. Did he even try to reassure you?
"\&gt;  “our” money was actually “his” money, he made pretty much 100% of the decisions that involved money. I was allowed to choose what we ate for dinner, that was pretty much it. This was of course the fair and logical choice, as it of course was not my place to dictate what someone else did with their money 

That is the wrong mindset as well, though.  My Mom has always been a SAHM.  My Dad made all the money in their marriage and still does after 37 years.  He does not ever dictate what happens or what they buy.  He doesn't give her an allowance or police her spending.  They make ALL financial decisions together.  She doesn't waste money, he doesn't waste money, and they have a set amount over which they discuss a purchase, otherwise they buy what they want or need.  In a GOOD marriage and partnership, there is none of this mine vs yours, or one person having all the decision-making power, unless one partner is an irresponsible spender, etc.

\&gt;  He told me: “In the future, this is NOT going to happen. You’re not going to be allowed to use our money to enable your brother just because you hate conflict” 

Oh HELL NO!  Nope nope nope.  This is a massive, waving, burning red flag.  This is a controlling man who will NOT be a good partner.  Please break up with him."
"She’s extremely stressed, scared and hormonal. 

You called her Wonder Woman, it makes me think that she always has it together and she’s let this build and build until she snapped over something silly.

Triplets are a high risk pregnancy and delivery. My cousin was pregnant with triplets, near the end she would break down and cry about how she’s scared to die and doesn’t want to leave her other kids.

Your wife’s body is going through a lot, on top of that she has a baby to take care of too. Sit her down and tell her she needs to communicate with you when she needs help. Even Wonder Woman needs help. 

Is her mother near by to help? Or does she have any sisters? I’m surprised her doctor hasn’t put her on bed rest yet. "
"I agree. No contact. I had a similar situation and honestly I think she was trying to make herself feel better. 
Sending you a hug!"
"Holes around plumbing are very common and sloppy contractors will make them much bigger than they need to be.  However, your gut feeling shouldn't be ignored.  Since the landlord filled them, keep checking them to make sure they stay that way, and start looking for a new place to live.  "
"The #1 reason for divorce is finances. If you aren't even married yet and you cannot align on financial expectations, plans, etc. and ESPECIALLY if you're having reservations about his intentions then the marriage is already doomed to fail. I CANNOT stress enough, trust your instinct if you proceed with marriage and it ends up failing, you're going to really F*** yourself in a divorce. "
"And especially because you have a child who is and will always be connected to your late wife. She isn’t an ex. She is the mother of your child, and a massive part of your history. You need to be mature in the conversation, but be firm that her request is unreasonable (because it is, imo). The sooner the better. "
I think if you held the fight in honor of him with proceeds going to his family without specifying that the money could be used for his sister's medical expenses it might go over better. Her health shouldn't be made public without her consent and I imagine in your boxing community it's already been made public your opponent was killed. If his family won't accept the money perhaps they'll be willing to host the fundraiser to give the money to a charity which meant a lot to their son. Are there any non profits in your area who help youth get involved in boxing or anti drunk driving campaigns?
"&gt;I wanted to put my daughter into a pre-kindergarten tutoring program

Not only is he financially abusing you, but he's actively sabotaging his own child's development so he can eat junk food twice a week.

Leave this selfish POS, op. I know its not easy, but you and your kids will be better off, you said so yourself."
Call the non emergency police line and ask if someone will escort you to remove your belongings. Otherwise you could potentially sue her for replacement costs of whatever you have. I'd make sure these things are worth it though. I can't imagine it'll be a good experience trying to go back there.
"&gt; I would love to talk to her and have deep conversations but when it goes to the conclusion that it’s her fault, she plays the victim card and walks out of the room, doesn’t talk to me for an hour and says that I always think I’m right

That's the main problem in this relationship. You're dealing with an emotional terrorist. The other stuff is petty examples of this main behaviour. How long do you think you can continue accepting this? Is there a future there, if you can't plan for it? You can't negotiate, you can't convince, you're always the villain. Think hard, before she gets pregnant and finds a reason to stay at home forever."
"Issue One: Stop helping him study. Not so he fails, but because you're not happy with your own grades, so you need to use that time for YOU to study. It's not rude. Why would you feel bad about telling him you need to focus on your own grades? Not everyone benefits from shared/group studying situations.  Stop being a doormat. It's not rude to have boundaries. You don't even need to have a ""confrontation."" Next time he asks, just say ""I need to focus on my own studies. I'm sure you'll figure it out on your own."" If he pushes, he's a jerk. If you're okay with that anyway, reply ""I'm not happy with my own understanding of the material yet. I'm sure you don't want me to risk my own grade at your expense. You'll figure it out.""

Issue Two: Life isn't fair. Some people have luck. Some people have privileges. Some people have talent. Grades aren't just a reflection of how hard you work. It's not ""unfair"" that he does better than you with less work. Maybe he's smarter. Maybe he just has a knack for this kind of stuff. That's life. 

Issue Three (Probably the most important one): It's not ""rude"" or ""mean"" or ""selfish"" to say NO to people. He wants something (your personalized tutoring services), and you don't want to give it, but haven't told him that yet. It's up to you to communicate and enforce your boundaries. Don't leave it up to other people to guess them, and count on their kindness to not take advantage. He's not ""leeching"" from you - for all you know he thinks you enjoy tutoring him, because you haven't even tried to tell him no yet. So say no (see above suggestions for how). 

Issue Three, part two: Maybe he will be offended, or his feelings will be hurt when you say no. Another big lesson in life is this: Just because someone's feelings are hurt doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong."
"You already know what you have to do, so let me hit you over the head with it a little... I was in your position. You've said she's not attracted to you. She wants an uncompromising open relationship. She's already looking for other people. She won't talk about fixing anything. It's all her way or the highway... Here's what you do. You file for divorce. She's forcing your hand.

You're only 25. You'll bounce back so fast.

You say you love her, but is that how you want to live? With the woman you love so dearly treating you like total garbage? No. You're young, go be free. Take the lesson learned. It'll be a great story to tell later. "
"Well, there are two points here. The first is that, in fact, we should always look for relationships that make us satisfied and complete. Relationships that leave us wanting more, that make us miss the person and that are intense. All this is really normal and it is healthy that you want it from a partner. It's perfectly normal for you to want this from a relationship.

That said, point two is that you're a recovering addict.

No, you read it right. People who go through disastrous relationships, as surreal as it may seem, often become addicted to the cycle of emotions that happen during them. This is because the brain differentiates our emotional states much more when there are peaks of opposite emotions.

For example, have you ever drunk water after you've practically fainted from thirst? Or did you eat food when you were very hungry, or did you even manage to go to the bathroom after a tight time? If so, I bet if you try to remember well the feeling you had in those moments, it was probably more intense than usual. The water seemed incredibly refreshing, the food was much better than normal, and going to the bathroom gave you such a relief that you felt even slightly drunk and relaxed on your way out. 

This is because of the opposition of extremes: not that the food was really wonderful, but because you were very hungry. When the brain deals with the output from one extreme to the other, by comparison, it makes certain experiences seem much more intense than they really should be. A snack at MC Donalds suddenly looks like the tastiest food you've ever eaten in your life, if that's what you ate after spending 18 hours without eating. It wasn't the burger, it was you.

Now imagine you go through this experience over and over again. Time after time after time, for a while. Your body begins to get used to it, begins to want more. In the case of abusive or bad relationships, what happens is that the lows are so low that even normal attitudes seem high. The day your boyfriend gave you a gift, or was affectionate with you, gives you twice as intense a pleasure and satisfaction because you are actually desperate for attention. Because it makes you feel so bad that when you do something that does you good, however trivial it may be, it seems like a blessing, a wonder.

ou most likely have your sense of normal distorted. It is not that it is normal to feel a mild reaction in a ""good"" relationship, but it is that your mind is addicted to the ups and downs of bad relationships. Because your current boyfriend doesn't throw you off the cliff and then pull you back, you're not feeling the same level of emotional reaction as before, because the ""emotional trail"" you travel with him is actually much smaller. It's not that the highs are lower, it's that the lows are not at the bottom of the cliff.

I would say that you may need to give time, and perhaps even seek a conversation with a psychologist to help you ""recalibrate"" your emotional side. Because the human brain is able to get used to all sorts of situations, even bad ones - and that's why people who experience abusive relationships often end up going through a number of relationships in sequence. Because their minds end up accepting that kind of experience as normal. You may need to detox first, before your emotions return to the healthy pattern."
"Why waste both of your lives in a loveless relationship? Break up, stay communicative and amicable for the sake of your child, and find someone who will make you happy."
"You should also take into consideration that they’ve probably heard homophobic rhetoric from your dad, assuming he had not changed his ways in the time since you’ve been no contact. I don’t have advice necessarily, but I just imagine that will be an unfortunate added complication in your relationship with them. But it sounds like you guys have been the most open and loving in this crazy situation, and I wish you the best in it! "
"If your daughter came to you with this problem, would you tell her to hold herself back for her husband?"
"Okay look. I want to side with you. But then your comment history is full of comments on r/ raisedbynarcissists about how awful your parents are. How they kicked you out of the house when your chores weren't done well enough. How they tried to make manipulate you into a child marriage with a rich guy. And you comment just as often on r/ justnomil about how much you can't stand your MIL. You comment that you're a sahm and your mental health and marriage are already suffering. So there's so much more to this story than your husband leaving to play games with your kid and making a disparaging comment about your family. In fact, if your comments about your parents are honest, he SHOULD hate your parents. He should want to keep them away from your kid. It sounds like you need some personal counseling to work through your family trauma, and some couples counseling to work through what a healthy family dynamic looks like for the two of you."
"Yeah, with no exaggeration.  Saying what he said *truly* emasculated him, even though her getting a promotion wouldn’t have in the slightest.  

I can’t speak for OP, but someone saying that to me would seriously degrade my view of them.  It’s tough to take someone as seriously when they announce that they’re this weak in their own identity.  Totally debasing. "
"Why are you actively trying for a baby with him when you are in this situation that not only is clearly making you unhappy - but that he has literally shown _won’t make him propose_ based on it the fact that you already got pregnant once and weren’t happy with how reacted to marriage during that time.

That’s insane. Babies don’t have to grow up in traditional marriages but at least sort your shit out one way or the other before you force it on a baby 

"
"I think you made the right choices honestly. You have set boundaries down and figured out what was really going on. 

It's sad she is dealing with infertility, I went through the same. But it's not your daughter's job to fix that for her. I am glad that your ex is on board. "
"One could argue it is physically abusive to demand you stay awake until 3 or 4 am while she insists on having serious conversations, denying you sleep. Blocking you the next day for falling asleep definitely constitutes as emotional abuse."
"Look, I'm going to go ahead and let you know that I'm not the most mature person in the world, but here's how I would look at it. This person cheated on you, and then immediately hooked up with who knows how many other people after breaking up. He has made you feel terrible so many time times, and instead of comforting you just lied to your face. 
Revel in it. You made this hypocritical asshat cry! You made him feel everything he put you through. He's fucking jealous, and he just doesn't get to have you like he did and that makes him upset. You fucking won, girl. Stop talking to him. Everytime he texts you that dramatic bullshit just remind him what he did. I noticed you never mentioned actually saying to him, ""you've done the same thing to me but WAY worse, multiple times, and lied to my face. We are not together, you don't get to make me feel bad for this."" 
Girl stand up for yourself. Dude's garbage."
"Your wife should delete the bio mom's comment, block bio mom and forget about her.

You should support your wife.

The good news is that your wife has an actual family and it sounds like they raised her well.

Forget the religious implications. Forget the whole thing. And forget the bio mom."
"Depending on the length of stay, $1500 for an all-inclusive trip to Aruba is pretty darn cheap, IMHO."
"If your anxiety is so bad, you can't go to dinner with a friend and some acquaintances for a night, then I hope you are getting therapy.  She's not asking for much here.  If even this little request is too much for you, then you probably shouldn't go.  Hopefully, you can set up a one on one celebration for her birthday some other time, but you might not get that chance.  

Either way, please consider talking to a pro about your anxiety if you aren't already.  A simple dinner gathering should not be this stressful for you.
"
"This isn't whiny, ""hangry"" behavior, this is real anger and emotional abuse. I would advise you to leave him, but if you won't here are some suggestions: during a time when he's not angry, sit him down and ask if he'll consider doing the following things: First, will he go to a doctor to make sure he's not having any medical issues that are causing this anger (eg hyperthyroidism). Second, will he start therapy for anger management. If he won't do either of these things to change his behavior, please don't stay with him hoping one day it will all magically get better. It won't.

"
"&gt;Now I was considering dating him,

Don't. 

He could see your nails before he went out with you. He thought he could tell you how to be, and that's a huge red flag.  "
"First of all I'm sorry for everything you're having to deal with. Life often seems to just throw everything at us all at one time for some reason. I know it seems impossible and painful, but take each day at time, give yourself some small space to breath... you will get through this, it will pass and ease, even if it doesn't seem like that right now. You got this.

As for your dad... oooof. 

Don't make big decisions right now. But what you CAN do is say ""Dad, I cannot deal with this right now. For now, I can't talk to you or see you. I need to process the situation with grandad and support mum, that's my focus right now. I will come back to deciding what I feel about you and how you have betrayed your wife and family, but right now I cannot do that. I will be no contact till I am ready to deal with the impacts of your betrayal.""

Basically, put him and his bullshit on time out till you're ready to deal with it. Focus on your grandad, your mum and your boy. You can circle back around to your father in a couple of weeks or months or even years, when you're ready. You don't owe him anything right now. With the emotional and logistic load you have right now, his bullshit is the lowest priority, so treat it as such.   


Going no contact doesn't have to be a forever choice, it can be a for now choice. Deal with him when you have the emotional &amp; mental space to do so. Giving yourself this time &amp; space will also allow you to deal with it objectively, and not fall for his fake ""I'm sorries"" out of exhaustion and just wanting some relief of the pressures that you're handling right now. So you can make a choice you won't regret one way or another.

I wish you all the best."
If your best friend told you his girlfriend treated him like this what would you say to him? 
"If he doesn’t know to keep his hands to himself and to respect other people’s boundaries at 31 years old, he’s never going to learn."
I'm having some trouble believing he really thought he was 3 inches taller than he is. Has he really never noticed that he's not much taller than other men around him?  Is it possible you caught him in a lie and he doesnt want to admit it?  Was the height chart your idea?  Was he at all enthusiastic about doing it?
you dont trust ben... but you are marrying ben? 
"Polyamorous person here. 

Your rule is both extremely sensible and entirely reasonable. Every polyamorous person I know has a similar one; some of them insist on in depth conversations with the other partner, some are fine with just exchanging a few words or messages of acknowledgement. But some contact must ALWAYS be made.

There are ""don't ask don't tell"" arrangements, of course. But it's entirely personal choice as to whether you want to get involved in one of them regardless, as even if everyone is telling the truth, it often leads to you being treated like a dirty little secret anyway.

That this guy reacted as he did is a huge red flag; I sincerely doubt that he was in an open relationship. And even if he was, if his wife has a shred of decency she'll be horrified at his insults and harrassment of you. You are well shot of him.

The party is an issue; he might make a scene, or he might stay away from you and act sulky. Hope for option 2 but plan for option 1. Brief some of your friends on what's happened; show them the messages and ask them to not leave you alone. He will likely not cause a problem with a witness there, and if he does, that's someone else on your side for the aftermath.

IF he is even there. Invited doesn't mean attending, and frankly if his marriage is imploding after this, he is likely not to show in favour of trying to show willing to his wife.

But like I say; prep for the worst, hope for the best. Tell your friends, and ask them to stick close."
HELP you??? What the hell?! BOTH of you are the parents here. He is not supposed to HELP you. He is supposed to contribute equitably to parenting the children you had together. He needs to immediately ramp up the treatment for his depression so he can join you in shared parenting duties. Period. Full stop. 
"I have to go find my eyebrows as they have left my forehead. You did nothing wrong. He was a gross f&amp;ck who was going to do ""WHATEVER HE WANTED"" to you? What in the actual...what? 

I am SO glad this man is gone from your workplace. It's nuts that your coworkers don't understand that he was there to WORK. Not make dumb jokes or fall in love or get all nasty with the staff. 

&gt;I've tried speaking to both my boss and manager and they just say to ride things out. 

They did the right thing by firing him, but there is nothing for you to ""ride out"". Your coworkers are chiming in, not to protect him or get his job back, but to shame you (what on EARTH does your boyfriend have to do with this? He is not an employee, ya fricking geniuses! And why would he be ashamed?). 

Do not ride this out. Take the other job. You are currently working at a job where you have been harassed, threatened, shamed, downplayed and shamed some more. 

None of this was your fault. If making small talk in an elevator makes you a target...come the eff on. "
"His wife and daughter were going through one of the most difficult situations of their lives, and he wanted to leave to fuck his girlfriend. Fuck him, he's a horrible parent and partner. Not only is he a cheater but he leaves when they need him most."
Not acceptable.  I don't care how stressed his week may have or have not been. Calling your partner a fucking cunt is not ok and for me would be a dealbreaker. 
"I would ask, not to pry, but just to see if he's ok. Something like,  'hey I noticed you praying the other night, you know I don't know anything about prayer, just wanted to check in that everything's ok?' Or you can make it more general and not about the prayer at all, 'how are you feeling about the other night?' As a used to be Christian, prayer is very different for everyone, so it will be impossible to gauge without talking to him, but he might not want to talk about it, in that case let it go, and just see how he's doing.


As an also bisexual, but raised in the church, it messes with your brain. I was very open with new people, uni classmates, about being bi, I didn't think I had any issues about it. But the moment I told my brother (who was very cool about it) I freaked out, and all these internal negative feelings about homosexuality came up that I didn't realise were there. Not saying your partner has that, but just so you're aware that even if he seems cool about everything, there may be some more stuff going on related to churches attitude."
"I used to have a friend who had this, it's called Turner's Syndrome. There's actually an SVU episode about a guy who's arrested for being a pedophile because his adult girlfriend has it. It's kind of shitty; at the end of the episode the cops still think the guy must be a pedo if he's dating a woman who looks like a teenager. As if looks were everything.

I think she probably just wants to be treated like an adult. Honestly even us women who look our age have to deal with enough men who are condescending and treat us like children, for her it's even worse. Don't talk about her looks, talk about what's important to her, what she wants in life, what she thinks about things. Take her seriously. That will matter to her more than the opinions of random strangers.

(and a word to the wise, most women with Turner's are infertile, so in case you don't know already, be warned that future children could be a sensitive subject. For my friend who had it, that was the hardest part.)"
"He hasn't wanted gifts since he was NINE. That's 24 years. By now, I think it's safe to assume he really really means it. 

I think he handled it badly, but he probably was trying to not hurt your feelings in the moment because he could see that you were exited about the gift. Basically, you both messed up with good intentions."
"And i'm confused as to why OP didn't initiate leaving!   Like...they literally sat there confronting this couple+ small child while she's freaking out and has all this time to say all those things.

I'd be pulling at his arm to GTF outta there!   Why in the hell would you continue to be in these people's face...listen to all that .... when they are clearly trying to *run away from you*?????  "
"You need to talk to him about this - not just the exclusion of your family and his acting like they don't care as much as his family, but also the fact that - given he left *you* behind at the table - he doesn't seem to regard *you* as a member of his family. That's messed up."
"There is this example I try to remember when it comes to my mother (who I don't have contact with any longer).  If you are all in a boat and your SO starts to rock it, then the answer isn't to figure out how to stop rocking the boat.  We get conditioned to run around trying to stop the rocking as opposed to looking at the person *doing the rocking* and hold them accountable to stopping.  It's not our responsibility to stop the rocking while they're still taking active measures to rock the boat.  Sometimes the only answer is to toss them over.

I don't know, but that really helps me visualize it."
Tell him to pay Mel to pick stuff for them then.
"i mean i wouldn't say that Tracy acted ""super maturely"", exactly. but i commend her for eventually communicating what was going on with her, that *is* mature of her."
"Your husband sounds like an asshole. Punishing the kids for no reason to make you feel bad and then thinly justifying it by teaching them that ""life is unfair"" is cruel and, frankly, fucking stupid.

&gt;So, after this giant wall of text, I just want to understand why he would do something like this? What does he want?

He wants to have power over you and over the kids. He wants to be able to bend everybody's mood to whatever he wants, and have total control over the family.

&gt;At the time I felt really angry, but I knew that if I got angry, he would just get more angry and he is pretty scary when he’s angry.

Fun!

This seems like it's headed down a very shitty path. I would be insisting on counselling, and if this dynamic can't be broken and he can't get his anger problems in order then you have to start to consider that keeping your kids in an environment where daddy's mood dictates everybody's lives isn't the healthiest thing for their development."
"Well, you didn't kick her puppy or something, but you screwed up. 

She may get really cold easily, but YOU were the one shivering and dressed inappropriately. I'm not sure how much I buy that this was you doing something thoughtful for her. Feels like you couldn't figure out how to go out into the cold weather wearing proper attire and how to navigate that back into the indoors. (Coat check, light layers, coat on the back of a chair. You're 23yo, dude.) 

I don't understand how no words were spoken. You're stuffing her an Uber with no explanation? She's silently letting herself be stuffed in an Uber and doesn't ask why she's leaving? 

She took 2 hours to look smoking hot. You brought her to some apartment for free drinks and she *never even walked into the club*. If I were her, I'd be wondering if you were cheap or didn't want guys to see me looking hot...neither may be true, but your behavior isn't chivalrous like you are presenting it and viewing it. **Clubs have queues, and the weather is cold in winter.** Why did this come as a shocker to you? It seems like you just didn't want to go for some reason. 

Then your idea to make it up to her is to make her breakfast? Meh. I don't think you have to apologize in sky writing or something, but you're offering eggs and bacon to make up a ruined night on the town. Make it up to her by planning an even *better* night on the town, dealing with the weather and not making decisions for her. 

And again, you're 23yo--use your head. If making breakfast is going to wake her up, get off your arse and go BUY breakfast. Or take her out to brunch. And wear a flipping coat!"
"He tried. To trap you. He only told you because you postponed the wedding. He tried to trap you. There is NO saving this, in my opinion. Doesn't matter how sweet he is, he tried to trap you. And what do you think would happen once you've paid off the debt, if you went along with his insane plan? He can't be trusted to not go make more debt. Run. Now."
"He just told you A LOT about himself. 

1. He is violent. And it's only a matter of time before he directs that at you as well.

2. He thinks he has the right to control other people. Not just you (which is bad enough), but the whole goddamn world. And when that fails, which it always will because he's not King Of The Universe... refer to number 1.

3. He thinks that the only reason men talk to women is to hit on them. So what do you think is on HIS mind when he interacts with women? Cheaters think everybody cheats, because it's the only frame of reference they have and it makes them feel better about their own shitty behavior. 

When people tell you who they are, believe them. He just told you all of these things about himself. Please listen."
"Its sounds to me that more than anything you're burnt out from supporting him. He hurt you for so long and now expects you to participate in his recovery. It sounds like the past cut too deep for you to really love and respect him as a partner anymore. 

It's okay to have fallen out of love and adjust your relationship accordingly. He'll always be the father of your kids but he doesn't need to be your responsibility anymore. It just sounds like he never has and probably won't be able fulfill your needs in the way you're looking for. That's not his fault but its best to move on if that's the case. "
"Her logic makes perfect sense, given her premise. She wants all the attention to herself."
"So, he's the Brit right? Politeness is highly valued in the UK.  

Politeness is in the tone of voice, in the way you look at people, in saying please, thank you, in making small talk (How are you etc.) before asking for a favor etc. etc. 

First off, being impolite doesn't make you a bad person. And common courtesy says that pointing out somebody is rude, is considered rude. However, it doesn't sound like you are rude, it sounds like you are moving outside of cultural norms, which is super normal when you are an 'import'.    

Depending on where you are going to live, it helps to talk about these cultural norms and to listen and see what other people are doing. City folks who don't say hi to their neighbors are considers rude, if they start living in a small village. Small village folk are considered 'quaint' when they say hi on the streets of a big city.   

Don't consider it a 'fault', but do consider that if you want to fit in more, it helps if you practice the cultural norms. Role play with your bf, ask him to tell you afterwards and don't feel self conscious about it. It's not that you are rude, it's that you don't follow the same cultural norms. I bet in Slovania he would be considered rude by taking up so much time and twaddling when ordering. 

I'm from a culture that prizes politeness a lot (Chinese), but I live in another European country, so I often meet people who do not follow my cultural norms. Sometimes that leads to hilarious situations, like the unspoken cultural Dutch norm to 'finish your plate' meeting the unspoken cultural Chinese norm to 'always have left overs of everything else it means that the guest wasn't able to eat to their hearts content'. I had one friend telling me that he just overeats whenever he was at my place and he didn't understand why I kept making more food! I kept wondering why I wasn't making enough food because he was finishing it all :D  

Most norms are unspoken, so it's normal to blunder.   "
"Sounds like roids, so it could get better if he stops taking them."
Best comment so far. Good advice
"And even if he is, who gives a fuck?

&amp;#x200B;

He *should* be embarrassed and ashamed. And if he has any kind of moral fiber, he'd suck up those feelings and at least reach out and admit that he has colossally fucked up, understands if his daughter is furious at him, and hopes that someday, if/when she's ready, they can rebuild their relationship. "
"Wait, so your couples therapist is the same therapist who has been treating your husband individually?  

No.  No no no.  This is a terrible idea and I can't believe the therapist went along with it.  If you and your husband both want to work on your marriage, you need to find a new couples therapist to see you jointly.

That being said, I don't know that there's a marriage to be saved here.  I think your husband is already out the door and is just scared to pull the trigger.  I'd encourage you to seek therapy on your own to try and come to grips with this and plan your next steps.

I'm so sorry."
"I think the first order of business is to get a therapist. Basically, you've been outed as 'aromantic', and it turns out your parents are bigots. You're going to need support, help with processing all of this, and figuring out how you want to move forward.

Even though you are not gay, I think you could talk to the gay community for some support as it's a parallel situation. You're out of the 'norm' of sexuality and your parents are not supportive. They probably have the best suggestions for how to move forward. If there's an asexual community that seems useful, plug in there as well.

&gt;Is there a way to resolve this without me having to apologize?

There's no easy way to resolve pure hate, which is what your parents have exhibited. The best thing to do right now is to further protect yourself from harm. Unless you get an apology from them or some neutral expression of interest, you should not open yourself up to more abuse."
"Frankly, I'd tell her. Because you know Sidepiece:24/MI is going to be replaced by Sidepiece:22/FL, then Sidepiece:26/CA.

Do the poor woman a favor. Let her get the house and dogs."
"&gt;  Having a cold does not make anyone “too weak to answer a text.” 

Exactly this. “I missed your text because I was asleep” is totally reasonable. But if someone is really “too weak” to answer a text because they’re sick, then the next time they’re able to answer that text they should be asking for someone to drive them to the hospital."
"&gt; She brought up that this was her house and she makes the rules. 

She said this to YOU?  or the kids?  So this is the kind of crap my abusive father would say (and also say about the house that my mom helps to pay into)...This is not indicative of a healthy dynamic at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I jokingly responded ""then I guess I'll just stop help paying the mortgage"" which I absolutely shouldn't have said because it put fuel on the flames.  

Good!  

OP...its time for therapy.  There is definitely more going on here and I have real doubts that your relationship is healthy if these are the kinds of conversations you are having."
"How about you tell him he's making you feel like a cash cow, so you want to wait until he's paid off his debt to get married."
"This sounds like my ex. Would absolutely latch on to the smallest, craziest of ideas with the thinnest of “evidence” and perseverate obsessively over it trying to prove I had committed said offense. Whereas I couldn’t prove anything myself because his accusations were always complete bullshit. 

Our marriage counselor pointed out that it was a glaring sign that he didn’t inherently regard me with positivity- that he truly viewed me as untrustworthy, someone he needed to guard himself against- and that never changed. He simply couldn’t give me the benefit of the doubt. Ever. On anything. If I was at the store five minutes longer than he “thought” it should have taken, I was obviously cheating on him. If I had a wrong number? I was sending a signal to my lover that it wasn’t safe to talk. I could write about this for days. 

Bottom line is this is a lot bigger than his weird obsession with catching you in a lie. It’s about the fact that he doesn’t hold you in positive regard. This is an enormous red flag about how he actually sees you. You are not his partner and friend. You are an adversary he is trying to “beat” at a game you aren’t even playing. Be careful about wasting too much time on this relationship OP. I don’t see how (or why) you should waste much time convincing him of a negative. You deserve better. "
The boys wants to keep them danglers.
"He's probably read too many horror stories about SOs hiding horrors in their finances.

Hell, read this sub for a week and you'll get plenty of nightmare fuel."
"&gt; I won't comment on getting a massive chest tattoo of someone you dated for a few months, 

I will: That's fucking crazy."
"IMO, Christiangreyisdraco is right on the money.   You’ve offered compromise and very valid reasons for your decision.  Your husband is intractable and that’s not a positive quality in any way.  

You are right in facing this issue now.  I don’t think it’s overreacting to insist upon therapy before trying to conceive.  

I relate SO much to your issue.  My son was solidly named pre-birth.  His first name would be the same as my husband.  I only asked for my deceased dad’s name as a middle name to honor my beloved father.  Hubby (now very happily EX) agreed.  We told everyone, including my overjoyed mother.  

A perfect little boy was born and I was beyond thrilled, albeit loopy due to drugs after my  C-section with serious complications.  As I happily and dreamily slipped in and out of consciousness, in walks my mother-in-law.  She convinced her son to insist on replacing the middle name with her husband’s (son’s paternal grandfather).  As I cried through groggy tears, he filled out and signed the birth certificate docs, omitting my dad’s name, but adding his dad’s.  I never forgave him for that.  It was a sign of how selfish, manipulative and uncaring he was.  I was too weak to fight them as they ganged  up on me.  I was very young and just learned I would have only one child (that I thank God for daily!).  

I fear your husband’s unwavering rigidity in this area is a sign of deeper issues.  Is he like this in other areas?  I hope this is isolated.   I admit that I may not be the best person to comment because my personal issues cloud my judgment on this sensitive issue.  

I hope I’m wrong.  I wish you well.  "
"Right? Jesus fuck. Cut the head off of the snake while you can. 


Disown you for not living your life the way they planned? Setting a time limit on a spouse? 


Especially a year. What if the SO turns out to be abusive or a psychopath.


Drop your family like a bag of rotten onions "
"A healthy relationship is like a house, a house where you can grow, develop yourself, feel safe and nurtured. Your relationship does not sound anything like this.

Therapy **does not** magically fix someone and make them the best person ever, so there's no need to see results from that. Leave, look out for yourself, be good on your own and escape from this monster."
"Well, your therapist has more context than us and he is right.

Sometimes you just gotta walk away.

"
"This needs to be higher. His recollection will absolutely be different than hers. 

For example: when my husband was drinking (sober now) he was mad at me, walked outside, got to the end of the walkway, slipped on the ice and broke his nose. I was watching the whole thing from the front door. After he got inside, he swore up and down that I pushed him. From 20 ft away. I’m not saying that nothing alcoholics say is true, but their reality tends to be very different than a sober persons would be. "
Even one call a day is 35$ a week. 140$ a month. Did she do the math on how much this is costing you? I couldn't afford more then that on phone calls a month. 
"That's not insecurity. Re-labelling your mistakes as lies to the point where you're having to spend so much time convincing her you're not a liar after slipping up and saying the wrong thing is emotional abuse. That's the kind of thing that sets up a climate of fear that prevents a partner from living their own life and will eventually lead to gaslighting and the partner doubting their own sanity. 

Your girlfriend may have no idea what she's doing, but regardless of that she HAS to recognise that this behaviour is really abnormal and really destructive. If she wants to be in a healthy functioning relationship where both parties feel satisfied and safe, she needs to start working on these insecurities. She has to agree to seek counselling. She also seriously has to admit that this is a problem. You need to sit her down and ask her to do that, because if she isn't willing to see this behaviour as a problem, you're going nowhere. "
"So how do you not ask him about the giant tattoo of another woman's face on his chest for the past 5 months? That's pretty hilarious, honestly. 

&gt; 2 prior relationships ended because of the tattoo.

Yeah, no shit. This is ""take out a massive loan to get removal surgery"" kind of a deal here."
"I'm going to be brutally honest here. Dead or not, you would not be wrong to end things because of it. This is one of those things you can either live with or you can't, and I'll say it again, you would not be crazy in any sense by deciding you can't. I won't comment on getting a massive chest tattoo of someone you dated for a few months, even if they died, but he had to have known it was going to cripple his relationships going forward. That's his price to pay, not anyone else's. 

So if you can live with waking up everyday and seeing that, or seeing it every time things get intimate, then don't let anyone convince you otherwise. But if you can't, don't try to convince yourself you can."
"So she can have months to obsess and worry and ruin her planning?  I'd really recommend waiting til closer.  You could have baby earlier, you could have baby later.   Please let it rest for now.  You don't need to spend the rest of your pregnancy watching her pout and tell the family how much you've upset her."
"Honestly, the most worrying part to me is the tattoo. I'd be less worried about copyright infringement and more worried about her relationship with Jenny. While she definitely has issues with insecurity and identity, it sounds a bit to me like stalking and impersonation. Not sure, but I would definitely tell your husband. "
"Lol there’s never a good time to ask for a divorce. It’s also a *rather bad time to be unfaithful*. What a pathetic excuse. 

You owe him nothing right now. Just be there for your mom and yourself. Take her to a spa or something if you can.
Don’t worry that he isn’t reaching out. He doesn’t want to feel any more shame so he’s gonna hide. Because he’s pathetic. Because that’s his character. I’m sorry. 

This doesn’t devalue the good times and memories. But you don’t owe him for being a decent person most of the time. Take time. Make no decisions. You don’t have to announce cutting ties. Just process things, it’ll be an ongoing process. 

"
"This! Feeling like her partner doesn't get where she is coming from will add to that isolated feeling, she needs a shoulder to cry on not just being told she's in paradise. Easy to overlook but it can make a world of difference."
"I broke up with my boyfriend three years ago when I was 27. I can tell you that we had the EXACT same dynamic as you. I applied to jobs for him, I helped him with his resumes, and I tried to set budgets for him, but after 4.5 years, things still hadn’t changed. At first I was devastated. But now, I’m with the love of my life and literally could not be happier in my relationship. I didn’t realize how much happiness I was sacrificing in that relationship until I found myself in one where I didn’t have to mother my boyfriend. Now, I respect and even look up to my SO’s ambition, and damn, it feels good."
"Seriously. Why are you letting your checks go to him??? 

Lawyer up, gurl! "
"I know I'm an internet stranger, but I want you to know I'm proud of you for making such a hard decision in the interest of your own financial security.  Successful relationships take so much more than love, and you deserve the chance to find someone who can truly be your partner."
"Just to add OP, if she does just show up with them you don’t let anyone in. You make it clear that she’s not welcome in your home. 

If at your parents’ home and she walks in despite it being clear you don’t want her there, you stand up and leave. 

Make it clear and tell them you are not interested in a relationship with her and will not be around her. "
"I think you're neglecting the fact that she cheated on you multiple times and didn't even have the courtesy to use protection. Whether or not the baby is yours, it doesn't change that she cheated on you quite willingly. This relationship is unsustainable without serious counselling, and that's only if both of you are willing. This is certainly not an environment to raise a child."
I think we know who does all the childcare here.
"Obviously there's something going on here, but you don't know what. 

His Dad could be a meek saint or his dad could have been a violent drunk who abused and beat the shit out of him everyday after school for 15 years. You don't know. We don't know. Ask your boyfriend what that was all about. "
"I’m making an assumption here, but I’d point out that the child will already be getting his (and his father’s) surname, no? "
"Damn. It's hard enough parenting two children, let alone *three!*

You need to ask him whether he's with you in this marriage or not. If not then you need to proceed accordingly. If he is, *then he needs to act the part*. Saying you can't tell him how to live his life? That's the cry of the irresponsible, not someone who takes his role as a husband and father seriously. As for additional help, how useful/available are your parents or his parents in this situation? If you're stretched thin then it's time to look for help you can actually rely on."
"You are totally incompatible. It's not a question of whether his behaviour is ""normal"" or not.

Why ARE you in this relationship?

&gt;  I'm pretty sure I'll never re-marry if this were to end, and will probably stay celibate,

This is your low self-esteem talking"
"They are wrong. You are worth a lot and have worked incredibly hard against the odds to get into college and learn English. 

Go to your college’s financial aid office and ask about getting emancipated, which would qualify you for financial aid to pay for college and possibly for housing expenses so you can move away from your horrible abusive family. These people are not worth your time and they are telling you mean things so that you will stay trapped. Don’t believe a word they say about you. 

"
Just say you met online and people will assume one of the many dating apps 🤷🏻‍♀️ not technically a lie
Why on earth do they all need to be in this city to help the person going through surgery? That is unheard of. Do they not have jobs?? You must kick them out immediately- where is your husband in this?? 
"This, definitely. They had no issue using your father until they used him up - they will do the same to you if you let them."
"Yeah, that’s not how a healthy, well-functioning relationship works. "
"So is this your husband's brother? And what does your husband have to say about it? Also, are they smoking IN your home?? The smoking thing is what triggers me. You have children and are pregnant. Even if they are going outdoors to smoke they are bringing some of that back in with them. This is your home, and you are not obligated to tolerate this. They didn't even ask to come stay! I think giving them a week longer is quite  generous. "
"Seconding this. OP, your kids desperately need a break from the chaos, and your wife is in no condition to be teaching them. Put them in a school and get your wife to a doctor and/or therapist if you can. 

I’ll warn you that if this is a hoarding compulsion rooted in OCD, it is going to be *extremely* difficult to treat. Even if your wife admits that there’s a problem, which will be a challenge in and of itself. Some people would literally rather die than get rid of their junk piles. You can hope for the best, but brace for the problem to get worse, and start thinking about what you’ll do if it becomes apparent that she will not get better. "
"I mean I literally told him I don’t know what our price limit is. I have a screenshot of the messages that I don’t know how to post on here. I don’t want to go somewhere expensive, I just heard Aruba was nice. "
"My grandfather is named Mr x + middle name y. My dad was named Mr x + middle name y. Which is nuts.

My dad's side of the family was adamant I was to be named Mr x + middle name y. My mom was having none of it so now I'm named Mr k + middle name y. He got over it. It's perfectly reasonable to not have the same name as a family member. 

On a side note:
Some 25 years later my dad is having a second kid who's being named... can you guess? Yeap - Mr x + middle name y 😂 honestly. I don't understand this ridiculous trend. God knows in like 20 years time I'm going to wind up with a nephew named Mr x + middle name y. Imagine Christmas. Wtf people. 😂"
"&gt;  I funded this car at the expense of funding my retirement.

Nope. You need to be blunt with this guy and tell him enough is enough. 

Also... Are you sure he isn't hiding a mountain of debt and thats why he relies on you so much even through he makes more money? "
There is no earthly reason why your parents can't just a) not tell your sister when they visit you and/or b) tell her that they'd like to visit you alone if she asks. 
"I have a friend like your Annie - insecure but also a frequent humblebragger about her body, her perceived appeal to men, and her intelligence.  We were four years deep in our friendship when I realized this quality was making it a chore to hang out with her and finally told her that I love her but I find this way of speaking about herself offputting.  I explained to her that I understood that it was a defense mechanism due to past experiences, but being her friend, I already know her worth and she doesn't have to prove anything to me.

That conversation almost ended our friendship.  She said she believed it was an attack on her and that I didn't love her sufficiently because I don't accept her for who she is.  She was very unhappy that I mentioned her past and said it felt like I was trying to break her down.   She suggested that I was just projecting my insecurities onto her and trying to change her behavior because I'm not OK with my own body/appeal to men/intelligence.

Honestly?  It was a rough time.  There was some payoff, in that when we both got tired of not speaking to each other and reconciled, she really did cut the amount of 
humblebragging by half.  She is more pleasant to be around now.  But the lash out effect and the aggression was real, and incredibly uncomfortable.  

From experience, my advice would be to do this only if it bugs you so much you're at the point where you're prepared to end your friendship over it.  You can give her your constructive criticism with love, you can have the best of intentions, but all of that goes out the window when someone prone to self-aggrandizement hears what they don't want to hear.   You should prepare for the worst case scenario of her attacking you as retaliation for how she believes you are attacking her, and the worst case outcome of no longer being friends following that bit of ugliness. "
"You can try drawing boundaries, but be prepared for your parents to pick her over you. I was in a similar situation with MiL and GMiL. Would've loved to have a relationship with the latter, but not the former. Sadly, the latter took me not wanting to spend time with the MiL as a personal affront. Oh well. "
"&gt; She's got a new bloke who brings round half a weed farm one or twice a weed and they hotbox our entire block of flats. I want to live in a flat that doesn't stink of weed, but don't want to confront this erratic woman. What can I do?

"You need to divorce him. This is financial abuse, contact a domestic violence hotline for help. And tell your family what he's doing. "
"He should be cheering you on, not holding you back. You guys are supposed to be a team, and he is making it a competition."
"&gt; And to boot she is pretty bad with gifts these days in general. So I’m not special in my not being made to feel special.

OP, are you and your wife still going on date nights? Do you both have ""me-time""? When was the last time you talked about happiness in general?

Sometimes, habits change. If your wife is stressed out, how about starting an amazon wishlist where she can choose from?"
"You said it yourself; you know what you need to do. 

I honestly hate when I only get answers that point to the obvious, so I’m sorry to be doing that here haha. But even for a relationship that is doing amazingly, 6 months is very very early to move in together. 

You’re finding things out about him that make him sound very difficult to live with. Consider yourself lucky that you are seeing these things prior to moving in! For many, it doesn’t happen until they are living together for a bit. 

Another thing to consider is the fact that he is almost 40 and has never had a relationship last longer than a year. I am not here to judge, but if he has been in relationships of which none have lasted? It’s time to look at the common denominator: him. 

If you were here saying that you loved him but thought it was too soon, I would say to continue dating and revisit moving in later down the road. But you sound very put off by this man so I question if it’s even worth it for you to keep dating. "
"Other comments have pretty much covered it but I want to say how transparent the ""I'm horrible"" pity party is. Stop feeling bad for yourself and trying to get random people on Reddit to comfort you and say ""you're not horrible"", and start making it up to your girlfriend (because yes, you did selfishly ruin her night after she put in a ton of work and probably had a ton of anticipation about how the night was going to go). We all fuck up sometimes. Just apologise for being selfish, and take her out again and make sure she has an amazing time. But cut the self-deprecating crap, that's just more selfishness on your part."
"&gt; Should I just completely ignore him and continue doing what I like with my **own** body? 

Yep, because finding painted nails, a really really common thing, ""disgusting"" and ""scary"", is **weird**. Now each to their own, and he can have whatever opinions he likes, but you shouldn't change your perfectly normal grooming habits because of his feelings. It's not about you pressuring him - if he starts pressuring you, that's when you say no, and if it's a dealbreaker for him, so be it. You're not being remotely unreasonable."
"Buy some house plants together. Home Depot/Lowe's is pretty cheap, Ikea sells house plants too (also cheap). Those plants would dig that natural light. You'd be surprised what a bit of greenery can do to a room.

"I'm an autistic woman with my own quirks,  so I don't mean this in an offensive way,  but this really reminds me of a few autistic women I know.  They are wrong-footed in social situations and often do this exact thing which comes across as awkward and even rude. Part of it is insecurity and part of it is literally not knowing what to do and not picking up on social cues. 

Many autistic women our age were never diagnosed because it was considered a condition that mainly affected boys. 

Could be something to consider, anyway.  "
"&gt; he only feels that way about his family. Not mine.

Your family IS his family. He married into it when he married you. I think this is your deeper problem and requires a serious conversation about the way he thinks and feels about your family. Time for a restructuring of the balance if it's tipped in his family's favor. This might end up being a blessing in disguise because this small incident brought to light a bigger issue that requires compromise."
"Hi, I had this exact same problem. My bf and I got rougher and rougher over time and at a point he was hurting me regularly. I kept telling him to stop but he never really “got it” because he would tone it down for a second and then next time the same thing would happen. I started ending any encounter as soon as he got rough. I think it really got through to him when he BARELY started to get rough when we were playing around/cuddling and I just got up and left. He asked what’s wrong and I said that he scared me. He’s like did I hurt you? I said no but I was afraid you were going to. My bf got very upset then because he said he doesn’t want me to be scared of him. He’s put in a real effort to be gentler since this but I still have to just literally remove myself if he starts getting too rough; asking him just doesnt seem to get the same point across. Good luck Bc it’s not acceptable for your bf to not temper his strength when dealing with you. Did he hurt you like this when you guys first knew each other? He probably is too comfortable now to bother being careful but you can enforce your boundaries, just be consistent. "
"To add: that she and her SO/husband immediately packed up and started to leave tells me she’s not a drama queen; if she were, she would have stayed and yelled. She noped the fuck out of there, which indicates to me that she’s telling the truth "
"&gt;The biggest problem is that I'm an atheist, and she, a diehard Christian, doesn't know that. I don't think, as long as I'm with her, that I'll ever start believing in Christianity, which can only hurt her. At one point, she told me ""if you weren't a Christian, we wouldn't be together.""

What the fuck. You can't marry somebody you're lying to about your religious beliefs. You don't even know if you're compatible.

Put the wedding on indefinite hold."
"Your husband really is being a child about this. Naming a new baby is to be a joint effort, AND compromise. Your reasons for not naming after FIL are all very good. I can’t believe your husband won’t even compromise on the middle name. I agree- this needs to be a counseling issue. It doesn’t sound d like you’ll be able to resolve this on your own. Is you husband a moron about other things too?"
"\&gt; I bought a book and she immediately thought I was buying it in secret for a gift for a secret person

Dude... GTFO"
he's very mature for his age and doesn't do these things that i'm about to list that he does.

"&gt;He then said ""Yeah, it's just a hygiene thing though."" 

This is the lamest excuse. Why doesn't he shave his hair though? Why aren't we all bald if hair is unhygienic?"
"I agree, and remember rules and consequences make children feel safe.  They make boundaries clear and let you know that you love and will protect them, even from themselves. 

My daughter is 26 we were talking just the other day about a family we know that is self-destructing. She said my follow through was an important part in how she grew up. I said what I meant and that was that. I took time to decide on consequences, to make sure that they were fair. She hated the wait time. She is amazing. I am sure that you will find your way with your sisters. "
"I would stop bringing Rick around so he doesn't have to endure your parents' criticism and ""jokes.""

I would also work on liberating yourself from your parents' household. You may be Filipino but you're also legally an adult, and that means you get to call the shots about your life, but only if you get out from under their thumb. If you have your own place they can't force you to attend church, adhere to a curfew, let them track your location, etc."
Does your husband have any mental health problems? Not being flippant but why else would be make such an odd accusation? Does he have somebody from his past who was involved in porn? Has he made any other off the cuff accusations?
"Pretty much this.

I get the sense that OP's wife is a stay-at-home mom, which is so massively isolating that it's no wonder she wants to go home. She can't continue as a stay-at-home mom; she either needs a job or needs to go to school or something to get her away from those kids long enough for her to value her surroundings.

She won't last under the status quo. If OP wants to stay in Hawaii, he knows what he needs to do."
"&gt;He considers himself Christian so I know the idea of marriage is important to him.

Theres a joke here somewhere. 
"
"What's more likely: that you're the one special person that he can be honest with, or that he's lying about that too?"
"Yeah your boyfriend is prepping this girl on the back burner. He is actively taking her out on dates while he’s still in a relationship with you. No  guy puts this much effort and time into a new female friendship unless he is sexually interested on some level.  

This icky feeling your feeling is cuz your boundaries are blatantly being stomped on by him. 

You don’t talk much about how your relationship is going otherwise, but IMO is a guy is doing this without any regard for his girlfriends feeling (of course this would raise a red flag in any girls mind) he’s already emotionally checking out of the relationship, but he’s too cowardly to actually end it.  At 21 I don’t blame him, my boyfriend at 21 did something similar. Don’t prolong this, you deserve much better than a guy who is literally taking a girl out on dates in front of your face. 

"
Is it emotional abuse? We have gone to couples therapy and I \*think she knows sometimes that it's ridiculous? But she insists that I should just do it to help her with her anxiety and it's not really a big deal for me to do what she asks
"&gt; I decided it was time to bring out the birthday cupcakes and told my husband. I asked him if I could borrow his pocket knife to open the taped cupcakes boxes. He handed it to me and I turned around to set them all up. When I finished and turned around I saw that my husband, the birthday boy, and his 3 family members were no longer at the table.

So here's a question. If your parents had absconded with the birthday boy for 1-on-1 time while your husband was setting something up for the group. Do you think he'd be saying ""oh yeah, family is important,"" or do you think he'd be irritated?

That might be a question to ask him. I bet even if he wouldn't care, his parents would. 

And honestly, call me a cynic but the fact that your ILs chose cake and presents time as the moment they absolutely HAD to have their one-on-one time with the boy? I could be wrong, but that smells of a power play to me. If these grandparents have a history of pulling moves like that or acting entitled, I think you have your answer as to why this particular incident pissed you off so much. "
"That's quite sad with Tracy, and I'm glad she realizes that she was inappropriate and intends to work on her grief in more constructive ways."
Dump him. DUMP HIM. He violated you and ignored the fact that you didn't consent to what he was doing. This is a guy you fire out of a cannon. 
Then go be alone and get a dog or cat. It'll still be more companionship than you're getting now. And they will voluntarily give you cuddles and affection.
"I think you should end the relationship, but I also think you could have handled this so much better. You had your phone, call a cab or get an Uber to the nearest coffee shop. But you stayed outside...were you trying to be a martyr?"
"And theyre 21 and 24 years old....just break up already, jeez"
"It kind of feels like he wanted the credit of being generous and offering to take her on a vacation, but didn’t want to actually spend the money. So he created a situation where it would be her fault that the vacation doesn’t end up happening, and he’s still the great boyfriend who *tried* to take her on a vacation but she just got too greedy."
"You should be terrified. It sounds like he views you as his property that no one else is allowed to speak to or interact with. And that's a very dangerous space for you to be.

There are relationships where things like this would never be a problem and I highly recommend you get away from this straight up lunatic and go find a real relationship."
"I even find it odd and controlling that they're talking about marriage finances after only dating for 6 months. He seems to be trying to nail down this relationship before they're even out of the honeymoon phase! Like, calm down a bit. "
"You could jus be asexual and that’s how you are. If you’re happy, it’s fine. But it could be that your reluctance to date or get into relationships is due to mental  health issues or trauma and if that’s the case therapy may be useful ."
"My one iron clad rule of relationships is this; You have to enjoy (or be in love) with the person you actually have, not the one they might become.

*Looks at age again* **Sigh** He's a misogynist and likely wants to control you. "
"So from your wife's perspective:

You spend a great portion of your time playing video games alone. This is time you're not spending with her.

You don't enjoy joining her in going out and doing activities. 

You decide to improve yourself. You do this by spending even more time away from home and away from your partner.

She expresses that she wouldn't have a child with you — presumably because you are so unavailable and uninvolved. She expressed this HORRIBLY, but abortion truly might be the best option if her partner isn't a suitable father and she's not prepared/willing to be a single mother.

You view basic courtesies as not inviting friends over late at night when your wife is trying to sleep as ""walking on eggshells.""

It's been 10 years and you're still not ready to take the next steps in your relationship and start a family. Instead of thinking WHY that may be, you're creating this narrative where you're a victim so you can self-sabotage.

If I were your wife, I'd be having serious reservations about you too. I think your relationship IS toxic, but it's not because your wife is a bad person. I think it's because you've failed to be a partner and now resentment has built up to a point that it's poisoning your relationship."
You have no idea how many times I’ve had this exact thought. 
I couldn’t get past the first two paragraphs before I was screaming internally. What is left for you in this relationship? How would you be worse off without him than you are now?

"&gt;Maybe 10 months ago I saw on his phone a message from someone on Bumble... He ensured me nothing physical had happened and he just sort of started talking to a couple people out of curiosity.

Uh huh...

&gt;Four months ago I saw a text on his phone from a girl that was really flirtatious. I couldn't help myself, it's wrong, but I went through and scanned their conversation. He was flirting back, being sweet, giving her pet names.

Starting to see a pattern here...

&gt;I'm not sure if anything really got resolved because shortly after I found out I have cancer. It was an excruciating blow. Both of us were devastated by it from what i could tell but he is dealing with this in a way I never expected. He's been secretive about his phone, hiding it when I walk into a room and keeping it with him everywhere. 

This seems to be following the pattern...

&gt;Honestly, he just hasn't been there for me. In the past two months he's gone out with friends and not come home until maybe 8 or 9 the next morning without letting me know where he was or why he didn't come home. He says he's staying at a friend's house, which is entirely possible, but I just don't feel okay about it.

Not great

&gt;Going through chemo has been the hardest thing I've ever had to do and he wants no part in it. He complains when we go for treatment and spend most of his time away from me while I'm recovering (which is the worst part of chemo).

Is this how you would react if somebody you loved was going through chemo? Why is it acceptable behaviour in a partner if it wouldn't be acceptable for yourself? 

Look at everything you wrote from a third party perspective. Imagine your friend was in this relationship where they got cancer and their partner was off flirting with other women and staying out all hours of the night. Like, this guy is obviously a dud and doesn't respect you. I suspect if you weren't the one paying for everything he also wouldn't be as willing to give you the little support he is.

You can't have this guy in your life. I would be looking to pull major strings to change your situation. If your parents are retired, maybe get one to come stay with you for a while to take you to chemo and shit. Downgrade your lifestyle to a bachelor apartment if you can afford to live solo that way. Take taxis/uber/lyft (or medical transport) to your appointments if needed. Really, I can't imagine going through something this hard and also dealing with a garbage partner who is unsupportive like this."
"You remind her of rent and bills? Your wife is extremely childish and immature. The typical she wants her cake and to eat it too. She also disrespects you choice of not wanting an open marriage.

Stop focusing on her right now, forget couples counselling and find a therapist for you, that you can communicate and share your feelings to, who will help support you , I think that will help you during the separating . Also seek a lawyer privately to get your ducks in a row . It’ll be hard and hurt but in the end worth it because you deserve someone who does want the same thing and doesn’t hound you and say cruel things like she does "
"He’s bad at communicating, and it *also* seems like he was ‘testing’ you. So since you didn’t do what he wanted without him asking you, he feels entitled to be pissy.

Is this guy seriously 28? He does not act like it."
"There are a lot of red flags.  I know for a fact that if I tried to tell my ex's current girlfriend about the shit he did, he'd deflect and avoid talking about it with her as well.  But, the fact that she named things that you yourself are seeing/have seen in his behaviour/overall is problematic.  I find it extremely questionable that he has money issues that come up - if it were me, I'd certainly want more proof of the things he's spending his money on given that he admitted he had a drinking problem (and I'm gonna guess he used(/uses) other vices.  
The punching, and the smashed glass are huge issues for me as well.  Right now, he's hurting himself, but what if you were to have a heated argument?  Have you had heated arguments?  Who throws a glass into a sink?  Probably someone who is poor at controlling their frustrations and feelings.  

I mean, certainly he could have gotten better - maybe is still getting better - from the behaviours and stuff that he had demonstrated previously.  But, I'd say there's weight to what she's told you.  And his wanting to avoid the conversation says a lot."
"so, even though it was soap, he was under the belief it was crack and decided to smoke it? Do you want to date somebody who is so quick to smoke crack?"
"Why are you marrying this women without getting your finances in agreement?  She’s flying some red flags here. Once your married, depending on where you live, you may be entitled to a portion of that house anyway should you divorce.  You two have a lot to work out before any cake is cut. "
"In this situation, yes.  You are enabling her insecurity as opposed to supporting her efforts (that she has to put in) to fix her own issues.  Supporting her is supporting therapy, her efforts to try, etc.  Enabling is letting her dictate how you behave and what you do because it's created some sort of expectation that you've done something wrong.  

I will say this, if you are closing off from her because she is training you with her overreactions, that's the wrong answer too.  The answer is to pick a boundary and hold to it.  She wants to go through your phone to make herself feel better?  No, and hold to it.  It won't make her feel better for anything other than a moment.

The goal is to work toward comprehensive change, not momentary fixes.  Right now you are in total response mode of momentary fixes.  Again, you can't fix her by anything you do, you can just support her in her own efforts, but that includes holding her accountable to effort to fix it.  Sometimes that means breaking up before it wrecks you."
He doesn't have issues because you are doing all the work. He is selfish. That is a bad trait in a partner. Very bad.
"He’s 28 and banging a 19 year old and he’s already bored after two months?

"Your husband is a fucking asshole. He obviously doesn’t respect you or all that you do for him and HIS kids. I’d book a room and get some space. It’s all you really can do at this moment. Go get a book, some comfort food, and bubble bath and have a relaxing night. Take deep breaths. Tell yourself it will be ok because it will. I have been here before so many times but I got through it and you can too.

If he still wants to be with you in the morning then you tell him to get his shit together, help out and respect your feelings or it’s over. I’d suggest couples counseling too."
"1. He often lacks sympathy and sensitivity
2. he shuts down completely when theres any disagreement or negativity. he doesnt want any arguments and his idea of resolving them is not talking about them.
3. hes still selfish, 
4. insensitive 
5. borderline inappropriate at times. 
6. He also refuses to see a counselor
7. this year we had to have several arguments over it because he has completely ""forgotten"" our earlier discussions and does not want to go to Italy.
8. He wants our 4 week vacation to be centered around the countries that he wants to visit. 
9. he wants to pick the location and thinks a compromise would be that I get to create an iteneary of what I'd like to do in these places instead.
10. he finally agreed to going to Italy, on the condition that its 4 days max and that should include the travelling period.
11. He wanted me to book everything and sort everything out.
12. I try getting in touch with him but he doesn't respond
13. he acts completely disrespectful, laughs and makes jokes over it when Im really upset 
14. I ask him what he was doing all day and he finally tells me that he was playing video games.
15. I still try telling him how his behaviour hurts me and how upsetting it is that he was gaslighting me when he knows the truth. He says Im being emotional and over dramatic and that I should just calm down its not a big deal.
16. He often tells me that Im too emotional and dramatic that Im questioning my own state

Here, you dropped all these red flags.

Please end this relationship, it is mentally abusive, he knows it:

&gt;Throwaway as he doesn't like me posting on reddit about him but I need unbiased advise/opinions on this.

Yeah, he knows well what he's doing isn't OK and he's afraid you'll listen to people on Reddit up and leave.

Two things I want you to think about, and please think about them seriously:

1. What positive things are you getting out of this relationship?
2. If a close friend came to you, and listed out everything I've copied and pasted above, what advice would you give them?"
"If he's like that over nail varnish, imagine what he'd be like over a toilet seat.

Fucking run, girl. Run and don't look back."
"This is where you decide what kind of person you want to be, and what standards you have for your friends. 

Lots of folks in this thread are telling you to ""stay in your lane,"" and lots are telling you that the man deserves to know and that you should be the one to give him a heads up. It's really up to you.

I can tell you there are going to be consequences. Unless the man already knows everything, the bombshell will put a deep crack in the relationship. Whether they split or not depends on how manipulative she is and how forgiving he is, but it'll never be the same as it is now. She'll figure out it's you, probably never forgive you, probably shittalk you to the world. Your best friend has tacitly thrown her lot in with the sugar baby, and this'll make for a hell of a rift between you two. 

On the flipside, by blabbing about the sugar baby at all, your best friend has put you in an untenable position. And you know why? Because on some level this all makes her very uncomfortable, and she wants you to share the emotional burden. Persuading you that it's cool is a way of making herself feel like it's not super shitty. In that sense, that there is a rift between you and your best friend is *her fault.* If it wasn't your business, she shouldn't have told you. Now that she's told you, you do what you need to do, according to your values. 

I think your boyfriend has his head on right, and this is a good sign about him. That you're struggling so hard with this doesn't speak quite as well for you. Your boyfriend has probably noticed. If I were him, I would evaluate your moral compass based on your actions here. (No pressure!)

Anyway, if you tell the dude, (a) make sure you do not oversell what you know, and (b) do reach out in a way that ensures it gets only to him. The girl has the energy to keep up six spare rich boyfriends, so she probably has the energy to monitor her main's social media. I doubt she would be so public about all this if she didn't have some strategy against getting caught. I suggest you try to go through a mutual friend who knows the guy personally and would be able to discuss it privately with him. 

I've been that guy, and I'm very grateful to the people who spoke up. Saved me more trouble in the long run than you could possibly imagine. You could do that for him by speaking up. 

But on a more selfish note - what goes around comes around, and you'll find yourself with a better view of yourself and hopefully a better circle of friends. Even if you lose a friend or two, or suffer harrassment by the girl, I think you'll come out ahead. "
"Well, wait until you're out there in your new city with a great job and find the Great Romantic Adventure your hopeless romantic side is looking for. 😉"
"Maybe she could update her hairstyle and clothing choices to look older?

Otherwise, I'd try thing like meet ups and activities so that you get to know me and more people. What kind of things is she interested in? Reassure her that you want her and it's worth it."
"As DM and a guy with the same symmetric issue I can tell you this:  
You are the DM, YOU are the rules and YOU decide what happens, no matter what. You can decide what's best for the group.

&amp;#x200B;

Session 0 is important to state why a group would stay together and cooperate to achieve a common goal. It is also important to balance the characters and approve their characters'sheet. If he picks too strong spells you can reject them and say that that kind of magic doesn't work in the world you want them to play in.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, he wants to burn the letter? Fine, as he is trying to burn the letter he realizes that the letter is enveloped in some kind of magical protection from commone fire. He wants to cast a fire spell? Fine, let him roll for an ability check and set a high score to pass. He passes? Fine, he burns the letter but the protective seals break leaving a scorched mark on his wirst, with the content of the letter. He fails, fine, fire ricochets on him dealing little fire fire dmg (1d4 if you wish).

The kind of players who deliberately derails the main story, turn on their party or start messing in a fucked up way with NPCs, are always to deal with directly. Tell him he is not helping and ruining the fun for everybody and if he is not ok with it, he has to leave, without remorse of effects on your relationship. If he is a true DND player he will understand, otherwise he is just a douche and you have to decide if you are ok with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have now discovered a flaw in his personality, how a persons plays DnD tells much about that person. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: you are the master, your word is sacred. you should tell him straight to his face to not be a douche, otherwise kick him out with any consequnces on your relationship."
"My favorite thing about this update is that not only did he evolve his views about the value of fitness, but you also evolved your views on academics/career. That is a really great thing that both of you were so open-minded that you were able to question your basic assumptions about your values and find a different balance. This isn't a story of a dumb husband smarting up, this is the story of a couple growing together. Congratulations. "
I don't get how he didn't compare your room to the rest of the apartment and realize who the designer was. My college boyfriend realized I was the designer roommate the second he saw the difference between mine and my roommate's room. 
"So, I am your wife in this situation. My husband and I moved somewhere new last year. We both make good money where we are and I am a contract employee whose contract is due back next month. I am debating not signing because I don’t like it here. One of my biggest reasons for not liking it is that I don’t have friends here, so I feel for your wife. It is super isolating to be the mom of a young baby/child and have no support system. 

Just in the last month or so I have started trying to make an effort because I know my husband likes it here. So, here are my random suggestions that may or may not be helpful. Have her try to connect with your local Hike It Baby group. It sounds like you guys are active and I’ve found the HIB group to be pretty great (and I am 99% sure they have Hawaii groups). Also, have her see if any local libraries have weekly story times. Our teeny local library has a baby story time once a week for children under 2 and it is a great place to socialize. Baby-free activities are important too, so encourage her to take a yoga class or volunteer one day a week at an animal shelter or something. Getting out and socializing will be hugely helpful. "
"Sleep compatibility is an issue for many couples. Some people snore loudly, some have sleep apnea machines, some thrash in their sleep or suffer from night terrors. Sometimes when couples work opposite shifts or when they are caring for a newborn it is logical for the couple to sleep separately. Sleep deprivation is a serious issue and will cause you to build up unnecessary resentment towards your partner over time as well as affect your day to day mood. 

If you have what is in all other respects a healthy, happy, loving relationship then the simple solution for you to live together and remain happy is separate beds at night. You can sleep with a space heater or a heated blanket and be toasty warm and she can turn her bed into the North Pole. "
"I HAVE to have the fan on to sleep, I need the white noise and I hate the feeling of no air moving in the room. I also get very hot when I sleep even in the winter. 
my husband gets cold so our solution in the winter time is I have the fan pointed at the wall furthest away from him. I still get my white noise to sleep and slight breeze from it coming off the wall and he doesn’t get sore throats anymore. "

"A BRIDAL SHOWER that has 150 guests?? Who is going to sit and watch someone open 150 gifts?? It would take an entire day. How will the games work? Yelling over each other? Passing around a microphone in a banquet hall? This is not a New Jersey thing. This is a crazy bride thing. I hope someone reins her in. I see it can't be you, but a small bridal party splitting a $3000 bill is frigging ridiculous. 150 guests and $3000 is an actual WEDDING for some people. 

Pick whatever you can contribute and attend whatever you can attend. You can't just conjure money for her ridiculous demands or stop eating between events. I would never expect a friend of mine to go broke for a couple of self-indulgent parties. "
"No, OP shouldn't be doing this. If he likes Mel's style so much, HE can ask her and offer to pay her for her time."
"Google ""financial abuse"", because that's what his mother did to him, and that's what he is planning to do to you. He EVEN TOLD YOU he will."
"But that's still putting her in charge of managing his emotions and expectations. It's important to him so he should be figuring that out instead of getting snarky with her. At best he's immature and wants someone who is both girlfriend and mother. At worst, he's being manipulative and shaming her in an attempt to force her to play happy homemaker (though I'm sure he's not willing to pay 100% of the bills to make that happen) instead of being a grown man and either problem solving himself or nicely asking for her help to problem solve it. 

While it would be nice of her to tell him how to get help with ***his*** problem (asking his mother or a friend with a home he likes), she should see it as a big red flag about how he'll expect her to handle his other responsibilities and give in to his manipulation and shaming of her in the future to get what he wants. 

He is either immature or has some serious personality defects that she has to do decide to either tolerate it (and risk it getting worse), encourage him to get some therapy, or decide she won't be renewing that lease in the future if this continues. For me it would be a deal breaker no matter what, but I'm not in OP's shoes, don't know his redeeming qualities, or the overall situation.

You made the right choice! Best of luck with the move! 
"See, it is one thing if he has all these debts BUT trying his hardest to turn things around. I would stick around for that and help him as much as possible. People will get into bad situations in their lives but it’s how they deal with being the real indication of who they are as a person, and how they will deal with any future problems that might arise.

It is another that he’s not helping himself. Damn he’s not your mess to fix. Sounds like you’re completely depleted and it’s time to look after yourself. You will feel guilty but seriously you’ll drive yourself further into the gutters if you don’t leave now. Maybe this will finally wake him up to realise how much of a mess he is with his life. "
"But why can't he feed himself as a grown man. Read what you just wrote. Without context, your comments sound like you're referring to a 2 year old"
"This read as chillingly familiar to me.   It *reads* like he has PTSD.   Perhaps he came from a not great home life and ran as soon as he could?   If he’s dealing with trauma from his childhood it could well present like this.

One thing I will caution you, as someone who has suffered mental illness *and* lived through other people’s medically diagnosed psychosis: do not take this to mean he is not dangerous.  The alarms that ring in your head are there *for a reason*.   A person can be a sociopath or simply ill, it doesn’t hurt bystanders any less when they lash out.   I’m not saying he *is* dangerous, but I urge you not to entirely disregard the warnings your mind is giving you.   If he is acting very strangely, it’s okay to back out of the situation and go somewhere public or with friends/relatives.   No matter what the cause, this behaviour is highly abnormal and is often - not always, but *often* - a precursor to some frightening behaviour.   

It might be worth having a talk to him in a moment when he is *not* staring at the wall.   I know you probably don’t want to ruin his good moments with this, but a good moment is the time to have this conversation.   Tell him again that you’re concerned and this time lay out *precisely what you are seeing as ‘something wrong’.  He asked you to be specific, so do that.   Tell him that the insomnia and the wall-staring are concerning and seem to be getting worse.  Ask him if he feels that is accurate.  Ask him if he has any insight as to why it might be happening.   See if he is game to make an appointment with a GP that you both can go to in order to talk about what has been going on and maybe get him some help.   If nothing else, there are medicines for insomnia!   I should know, I take them every evening.  

Stay safe, OP.   I hope you can get to the bottom of this.

This is basically what I'm thinking.. I just don't want to prolong the inevitable. I feel like it might be easier to rip off the bandaid so to speak..

The only way there is any hope at all for your marriage is if the answers to both those questions are ""Yes"". That would put you and your wife at the very beginning of a long, tough journey into her overcoming her upbringing and learning new, better habits.

If the answer to either question is ""No"", then I think this marriage is doomed."
"Please wake up! He's a 33 yo man who has lied to you about some pretty serious things. He's not a baggage handler who says he's an airline executive. What couch surfing means is, he's homeless. Did he tell you *why* he left his last gf? He didn't ""trust"" her enough to get a job and find a place to live?

How many women do you think he's run this con on? He's a con-man. He conned you, he conned your father and you know of at least one other woman he's conned. 

How exactly is he going to get therapy with no job? What kind of job is he planning on getting? How do you know he's ""talented""? You sound like an intelligent woman. Please don't get sucked into this guy's web of lies and by all means, keep your child away from him. You really have *no* idea who he is or what he's really after."
"Update: I spoke with my husband just now and I have told him I am moving out. (My own choice, I don’t want to live in this house). We are going to both find different therapists to see individually. We are not going to do couples counseling at least not at this point. I am keeping our dog, Chip, but he will get him a few days of the week and we will maintain a platonic relationship for now. I honestly feel relieved. It is awkward being in the house together. While I still really haven’t come to terms with separation, and I honestly am still hoping things work out, I do know he needs to change and I need to change to make this happen. Right now, with how we are, it is impossible. I don’t deserve the way he has treated me, and I need to treat myself better as well. "
"Yes.  My bet is that he will still (childishly) insist.   So just point out the numbers again and ask him to explain why he thinks you aren’t paying enough.   

Do you still have a car payment?  If so then maybe agree to pay part of his car payment if he is willing to pay part of yours as well as half the auto insurance. "
"Talk to them about it. If you have, time to kick them out."
"State clear and loud how fucking rude they are! For real, that’s more than not okay!
And don’t Cook for them anymore. You’re no free deluxe McDonald’s."
"There's no way to know what's going on in his head, but if he were a stable prospect, he certainly wouldn't be dating her again. Either he's been so messed around and manipulated by her that he thinks he deserves it, or he's just as dramatic as she is.

I have to ask, how do you know she was faking it?"
Just being responsible for one guy who dumps a kettle of boiling water on himself is too much for me
"Honestly man? I'm a guy in my 30's. If I found out one of my long time friends broke up with his partner of 6 years by email? Yeah it'd change how I think of them for sure. There's not much you can do there. I'd say just live your life, enjoy the new city. Maybe some of your old friends will want to stay friends as before, maybe some will stay friends at arms length (that'd be me likely), maybe some will just not. But there's nothing you can do about it now"
"Have you ever talked with them directly about how you feel here? ""Mom, dad, I am honestly still very hurt with the way you guys acted about my wedding and I'm really contemplating to not include you in my life as much anymore. I felt that X, Y, and Z things that you did were super selfish and I'm honestly appalled at how you made my wife and I's special day all about you. If we're going to rebuild our relationship, I need A, B and C from you. So, are you interested in rebuilding our relationship together?"" This is the sort of conversation you need to have with your parents at this point."
"I (a white man) was disowned by my father for marrying a black woman. He gave me a straight choice - the family, or her. That was close to 25 years ago and my wife and I are still together. You must choose and follow your own path, else you will regret it.

There is *no* reasoning with religious bigotry- in fact she has been taught that she *must* evangelize in the way she is for her faith. There is no fighting it. 

Have a fantastic relationship with your siblings (I had no such chance) and walk away from the toxic mess.

Good luck."
This is a perfect opportunity to suggest premarital couples counseling to get on the same page before tying the knot.
"Honestly, it sounds like he really took what you said to heart. It was what he needed to hear; he was new to managing, and his inexperience and bad attitude wrecked your life for a while. It's good that he can honestly apologize for it. 

That said, you don't need to accept the request or reply to the message. You've moved on, no need to invite the past back in. "
"I don't think the friend is the problem here. If her bf makes plans with her, but then ditches her to hang out with his friend, that makes him the douchebag. He could simply say ""No, I already made plans, I can't hang out with you"". "
"&gt; Issue Three, part two: Maybe he will be offended, or his feelings will be hurt when you say no. Another big lesson in life is this: Just because someone's feelings are hurt doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong.

LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN BACK"
"Honestly, it sounds like you're grasping at straws to come up with reasons they shouldn't go.

1. It's a trip with Sarah - but it's not, it's a trip with several people that Sarah happens to be leading. They're likely to be very tired, dirty, and generally unsexy while on Safari. 

2. Ben broke your trust a year ago - but if you believe that he's going to do something again, you should be breaking off your engagement rather than stopping him from the trip. 

3. It's a major trip without you - but there are many major trips to do on Earth, and if you want to do something as exciting as a safari you can plan it.

Ensure that they have separate sleeping arrangements (not sharing a tent) and ensure he has a steady way to contact you while he's abroad, but I don't see a reason you should stop him here."
"I hope this doesn't come across as dismissive of you all as men or anything, but do you have any female friends to be aunties?  The oldest girl and the middle girl are going to be going through some pretty intense stuff soon (periods, etc.) Since they didn't grow up with you all and you've never been teenage girls, it may be easier/more comfortable for them to have a woman to take them shopping for feminine hygiene products, explain how to use feminine hygiene products, etc.  

You all are awesome and kind to take on this responsibility.  I wish you all the best."
"You just gotta collect your thoughts, tell her how it is, one time only, and then hear her out, whether it’s a bunch of crazy nonsense, a bunch of legitimate sadness, or a promise to change everything overnight. Then apologize one last time and walk away. Don’t drag it out by defending your decision over and over again. What you’ve written here is fair and well thought-out. If she can’t understand it, nothing you say is going to get through to her."
"Wow, I really assumed you were dropping several grand, based on his reaction (which would have STILL been inappropriate).  


The fact that he reacted this way over $300? And seems to think that he would, in fact, have the authority to ""put his foot down"" and forbid you from doing this with your money in the future? The fact that he sees marriage as granting him this authority over you? Yikes.  


If you made a habit of financially supporting your brother, and if it was truly allowing him to sustain a generally irresponsible lifestyle that he wouldn't be able to maintain otherwise (like, if you were helping him pay his rent or bills), and IF financially supporting him was negatively impacting your own goals for saving for your future (as in--indicated true financial irresponsibility on your part) I would sort of begin to understand where he is coming from, as in that context, his reaction might be more the cumulative effect of watching you sacrifice your own future for your thankless brother.  


That doesn't seem to be the case here, though--right? It sounds to me like you're not really helping your brother out so much as you are *forcing him to be there for your sister*, because her happiness on this important day is more important than $300 to you, and you know that this is one thing you do, in fact, have the means to make sure happens. It doesn't sound to me like you're bailing your brother out; it sounds like you are putting him in a position where he actually doesn't have an excuse to flake out on your family by taking his financial situation out of the equation out of love for your sister.   


If you can't talk through this to the point where he agrees with you fully that he does not, in fact, have the right to dictate your financial choices that do not impact him, then I would probably leave now before you start to get sucked into the sunk cost fallacy. 6 months in and he's telling you about ways in which he'll control your decisions once you're married? That's a red flag. You are not overreacting to see this as a huge red flag. I think this dude has just revealed to you something pretty unsavory as to how he views marriage, particularly given that he doesn't feel like he can dictate these choices for you *now,* but DOES think he'd have the ""right"" to once *you are HIS wife.*

"To me it sounds as if you're dealing with a passive aggressive cheapskate who never planned on taking you anywhere in the first place and is trying to make you the bad guy.

Sorry :("
"&gt;My husband is athletic and eating is an important part of his routine. If he doesn't get enough nutrition, his muscles will start to hurt as they pretty much each themselves for energy.

&gt;I know that he's literally in pain

These are not things that happen, he's serving you a steaming plate of bullshit. He's just an abusive asshole who's looking for an excuse to let his anger out of you.

How should you handle this? How about, ""I'll entertain your tantrums no longer. If it's so important that you have meat after every workout, make sure there's enough in stock. If you aren't going to be grateful about the food i'm serving you, you can cook for yourself."""
"Please take that job. You worked hard for it, you had the motivation to do something more with your life, you earned it. Take that job. You'll regret it so much. 

If he feels that insecure, maybe that's more of a **him** problem than a **you** problem. He needs to work on that. More money means more support for your life and family. It would be dumb to turn down a promotion that is amazing. 

Take the job. "
"Agree agree agree. 

Also, his giant overreaction is a manipulation tactic. He gets you to feel bad and question the sanity of your original request (which isn’t entirely out of line). This is a form of gaslighting and is a HUGE red flag. "
"My girlfriend makes more then me and is currently up for a promotion at her job. I am nothing but encouraging and excited for her because I’m her partner, not an insecure little man."
"He's a 22 yo male who won't ask you out because of ""promposals""?
You've been seeing each other for 6 months, but he hasn't ""asked you out"" or ""put a label"" on things? But he's ""traditional"" so *he* has to be the one who does things?

What you have here is a weird mix of immature and controlling which usually equals high maintenance. I mean someone who doesn't want to ask you out because you work in a job where there are a lot of men...? Your remark about him not being man enough, was insensitive. What's closer to the truth is that he's immature and insecure...he's got some growing up to do and if his anxiety and depression are preventing him from participating in typical life activities, he should seek some help for that.

Bottom line: YNTA and you can do better."
"You're not selfish for not wanting kids, so your mum is wrong there. You are selfish for agreeing to marry someone you know you're incompatible with. He was foolish for proposing to you. You know he wants kids. You know he is going to be unhappy without kids. You should have broken up when you realized you were incompatible. "
"Honestly I think your comment needs more attention. Her getting pregnant and having her baby even in the same week as the wedding means that not only her sister won’t attend, but probably her mother and grandmother and other key people in her life. I would be devastated that on such a special day the people I love are going to have to miss it."
"Wow. OPs gf is the stepmother you hear about in stories. Things are okay for first few years and then when the gf gets comfortable, its the kid who suffers."
"Wow fuck that guy...

Cheating is honestly the lowest move someone can do. He felt guilty about his own infidelity and then hit you with a double whammy. So very disrespectful. I know it hurts now but thank goodness this came to a head before you actually tied the knot.

You deserve better and you will find better. Hugs. "
god i wish i had problems like this. 
"So OP is:

- Not an experienced traveller and just picked destinations based off of name recognition.  Jamaica is cheap

- Tried to talk about it to her BF and ask for a price guideline.

- Is now being guilt tripped and being told she's the socially unaware one.

I'm 41.  No OP, this isn't on you.  I think he wanted to appear like he could splash cash which then backfired when one of your wild suggestions wasn't in his price range.  He's embarrassed, and embarrassed people lash out to cover themselves.

This would be a red flag, but not likely a deal breaker.  He needs to apologies for over reacting, but give him an out and accept you unintentionally spashed cold reality over his generous gift - which in fast, was still pretty damn generous!  Make it clear you were just randomly suggesting places, would love Jamaica and see if you can put this behind you.

But watch for more signs of this.  There's no ages listed, I'm assuming he's fairly young and trying to act super mature.  He could grow out of it, but no, he didn't handle this well at all."
"What the fuck did I just read? 

Normal time you spend together as a couple ""doesn't count""? There are special requirements for going out?

She downloaded *five dating apps*?"
"She's right, she can't let you bring your boyfriend unless she lets everyone else do the same and it's her birthday so she gets to choose who she wants there. I think it was pretty presumptuous of you to ask not once, but twice when she gave you a reasonable explanation as to why it wasn't feasible.

You either have to decide if your friendship with her means enough to you to be uncomfortable for the evening, or don't go and risk losing her friendship. I'm not saying this to be callous, it's just that you can't expect other people to cater to your comfort on their special occasions. You and your friend and you and your boyfriend started out as strangers and you got to know them, there's no reason you can't also get to know these other girls. Just choose one that evening and try to have a simple conversation with her."
He got physical. Do not go back. Baby or not. 
"He is fully embracing your biggest trigger, and hid it from you for a YEAR. What future can you see with him that isn’t mental torture for you to be a part of?

For your own sake, end this now, there is no way for this to become a compatible situation for you. "
"In that moment where you were asleep and he realized what was happening, he also realized that there was a legitimate chance that this could be a fatal car crash and he would never get to see his daughter again. I think when you go through that, sometimes it takes a while to process the event and figure out who's to blame and how to cope with the experience, and how to balance being a partner with being a parent and all that. Give some thought that how you perceived the situation (which you seem to only partially remember and fell asleep for part of it), and how he perceived it might be quite different, and might have have affected how you are feeling differently as well. He doesn't get to treat you like shit because of it, but if he is needing a little space I'd be inclined to give it and be ready to talk things out when the time comes."
"If there is one thing that nearly everybody on /r/personalfinance and /r/relationships can agree on, it is that buying a house with somebody you are not stably married to is a TERRIBLE idea. 

You are being incredibly sensible and he just has no clue what a break-up looks like when you mutually own property.

Don't buy a house with somebody who isn't willing to commit to you."
"Your mom has done a great job of maintaining your boundaries with ex best friend, and from the sound of it she's been an incredible support system to you through all of this. Good for you for pulling through, and give your mom a big hug for being so freaking awesome."
"She sounds exhausting, like she's always trying to catch you messing up."
Agreed.  If my boyfriend couldn't find a second to text me back but goes out of his way to see and text a random girl immediately I would have a very serious conversation ASAP.
"Yeah don't move. There's no need to sacrifice a life you've built with your boyfriend. Moving in with her seems like a hot mess and a disaster waiting to happen. I would stay where you are right now if I were you, and suggest that she finds someone else who would rent the other bedroom.

Yes it is true that your brother needs to pay rent if she truly can't afford it on her own. It would be unfair for you to pay rent and he doesn't. Now leave the brother with mum for now and suggest your brother help out with rent as well. If she rejects all advice you could give, I don't see why you would bother anymore."
Tell her you have the engagement planned and that you want to write your own story that one day your grand kids can enjoy. 
"I'll say that if I were out with my wife and a former student of mine came over to serve us and was acting all happy and flirty with me, I'd be awkward and quiet as fuck too.  It's so uncomfortable if someone is into you and your wife is there, and you just don't care too much about this person at all.

I find the situation he described WAY more likely than her being some affair partner he was caught out in public with."
"This 100%. My SO has 0 issues with me (woman) being the breadwinner in the relationship and he actually took a pay cut to better his career after i got a huge promotion, knowing I’d be making significantly more. He jokes about me being a sugar mama all the time (I’m not, he totally contributes, but this is besides the point.) Your husband should be excited for the both of you because you’re a partnership, and a promotion for you means a step up in life for BOTH of you, "
"I love my boyfriend dearly, too, but it's unfortunately part of my DNA that I get intense crushes all. the. time. Since I was a little kid, i could be having a perfectly normal interaction with someone and then whoops, feels! What makes this tougher for you if that it sounds like this is the first time it's happened to you and if that's the case then I could see how it could feel way too big to handle, but I think I have some helpful tips.

Crushes are really more about you than the person. Your brain spots something in that person that you might feel is missing in yourself or your life and then do a weird synapse thing and you have obsession and intrusive thoughts. For me, remembering that it's just a dumb brain chemistry thing is super helpful! Instead of my inner monologue being ""omg I keep thinking about Nelson, I must REALLY LOVE HIM"", I'm able to say ""haha, there my dumb brain goes, being dumb again. I wonder what my cute boyfriend is up to?""

It also helps me to know that this is just a weird glitch of my brain, because the brain is looping on an image and a fantasy of a person that _doesn't really exist_. In any of your fantasies about B is he, say, picking his nose? Taking a particularly gnarly dump? Being kind of a wang about doing the dishes? Because I guarantee he does these things irl because he's a normal human being. Your brain right now is inventing this version of him that is the equivalent of of an Instagram, all the glam and none of the grunt, and of COURSE you would feel drawn to that. But remember that it's not real, and that if you did get with B the image would deflate the moment you learned what idiotic taste he has in movies ;) When I'm really deep in a crush, I sometimes like to invent dumb unflattering backstories for the guy (that I tell no one, obviously), imagining that that they were rude to a waitress yesterday, or that they had an embarrassing accident while on a business trip last year. It helps puncture the fantasy and remind that they're just grubby humans like myself. Likeable, but nothing worth obsessing over.

You know your boyfriend best, but if you think he's secure enough to not freak out or be hurt, it might be healthy to talk to your boyfriend. Crushes do happen, and if you discuss it in terms of having an annoying brain problem that makes you want to spend more time with bf and renew your romance so you can focus on the important stuff, it could help. Please do NOT phrase it that you have feelings for someone else that you can't sort out; that would naturally sound to him like you were thinking of leaving him and cause hurt and panic.

Stay the course with B; it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Perhaps be just a little bit more businesslike than you otherwise would be while you ride this out, and actively look for evidence that he's just an annoying, smelly human like the rest of us, to work on puncturing the fantasy. Please don't listen to the commenters saying that you can't go on this trip. Hurting your career and team over a crush would be ridiculous, first of all, but it would also make B and these feelings loom even larger over your life. Go. Remember how hot and thoughtful your boyfriend is. Thinking about how your career is awesome and aim to kick ass. And every time you think about B, think ""haha, oh brain you so crazy!"". And every time you see B....ew, is that mustard on his pants? 

You got this :)

"It's your house. They can't just tell you they can't leave. It's awkward and unpleasant, but you're going to have to be extremely firm and not take no for an answer. This may involve calling the police for backup, and that's okay. They are being incredibly rude. Can your spouse help?"
"If you can afford it, a lawyer can draft and send a Cease and Desist letter that carries the threat of legal action if disregarded. That's what I did. "
"I don't think it's a cultural thing so much as a personal thing with her.

Here's a nonexhaustive list of possibilities I've thought of:

1. She went through something traumatic before her family left, while travelling, or while awaiting resettlement. Refugee camps can be rough, ships carrying migrants illegally can be much rougher.
2. She wasn't originally in the country legally, and maybe still isn't.
3. She thinks Americans will look down on an immigrant, or on Russians, and doesn't want people to know she is one. "

"Hey there, it’s not ok that your parents forced you to shave your hair... partially sounds like a show off to the outer world... but on the “positive “ side: if your BF broke up because of your hair he did not realy love you but your facade... in fact be happy to have seen his real face before you waste too much time with such an idiot...
Sending you hugs!"
"If she was sooooooooo crazy and such a drama queen then why did HE go over an approach HER?? Why did he stand there arguing with her when she CLEARLY wanted nothing to do with him and was trying to get out of there?

Why would she have kept no-contact for 10 years not saying a word to him if she wants sooooooo much attention?

It sounds like he was trying to take an opportunity to bully and gaslight her in front of you."
"I think this trip together would literally end your relationship.  All current issues aside,  not helping in the itinerary gives him (in his mind) full rights to complain about each itinerary item because ""it was picked without me...I didn't want to do this...I wish you asked me before choosing this activity.... this hotel stinks,  you made a bad choice...."" and so on.  You will resent him by the end of it because it will be an expensive trip you worked hard on planning and he will stop you from enjoying it.  

Breakup or not,  but my god please don't go on this trip. "
"From what I understand, my father never told the kids he was married before their mom, let alone had a child before them. I can't imagine what hearing all that has been like for them.

And as for the homophobia, we're completely expecting that. They're kids; they're going to believe what their parents taught them to believe. I'm just hoping it doesn't hinder our ability to raise them with love and compassion for others!"
"Yep. OP is thinking about this backwards. The parents need to apologize to her and maybe, just maybe she won’t cut them out of her life. It may be scary for some people to think of not having their parents in their lives, but I think it’s scarier having parents like this!"
"Friend:  ""Is your sister hot?""

No, and he can't tell you how to live yours. He can't expect you to just tolerate being a single parent to *two* infants whilst he sits on his ass contributing nothing. 

You can't make him be a good father, or even want to be a good father. But he can't make you stay with him. "
"Tracy's manipulation of the photography session and having it posted online was terrifying (also, hyphenated names? already? Tracy's bold).

Don't stay with people who scream at you. Don't stay with people who control how you spend your free time. Don't stay with people who project their ex's bad habits on you. And definitely don't stay with somebody who does all of those things.
Yeah when OP said his muscles hurt and he gets angry for no reason my first thought was possible steroid abuse. My bf had a friend who we found out was doing that and it was suddenly like all tge weird behavior made sense. 
"Jesus.

If you want to stay married;

1.  She needs to return the car. (Normally you have 30 days, at least where I live.)


2.  Financial/debt counseling for your wife. She needs to learn how to budget properly. Also her father no longer has any say in your finances.


3.  Couples counseling.


Even with all this, I'm not optimistic for you, OP. You married her knowing she was a financial disaster and have pandered to her and enabled her all along. 

She's 29, not 20 so you have an uphill battle. This is who she is. Also, does she know you *hated* your wedding day? I would be mortified to learn my partner felt that way.  Are you sure you want to stay in this marriage?"
"He's conditioning you to accept that he gets to violate your boundaries whenever he wants. At 31 he knows that ""No"" means ""No"", and is just pretending to be ignorant. When you sit him down to explain clearly that he can't touch your feet he's going to act like he had no idea it was a ""*real no*"", and it was just good fun. It's a lie. He knows you don't like it and that's why he's doing it. 

Don't walk away from this guy, **run**."
"If you share a dryer with other people, then ya, it’s definitely possible that this hair was in the communal machines and stuck onto your sheets. 

Do you have any other reason to suspect that he brought someone over to your family home. Logistically is this even possible? Have you been out of town? Does he work from home while you’re out all day? 

I think you should think about these things before jumping to conclusions. Then if you’re still concerned, just talk to him. That’s the best and only way to get an answer. "
"Even if it says exactly what she has already told you, it will be re-opening old wounds.  If you are happy with the progress you have made, I strongly urge you to not look.

"yeah thats a big red flag. It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s cheating on u, but it means he doesn’t care how u feel. He doesn’t worry about ur feelings. that’s messed up. anytime i seem a little bit sad, my bf will ask right away and make sure im ok and if a girl made me uncomfortable, we will talk it out like adults and try to find a reasonable solution."
"This situation isn’t fair to you and it’s certainly not fair to the guys she (or you, more accurately) are texting. Imagine enjoying hitting it off with someone and then finding out that someone else was making all of the moves you enjoyed. Personally, I’d be pissed. 

You need to stop enabling her. She is shy. So are a lot of people. The minute you stop doing things for her is the minute she’ll actually have to pull her own weight and build up her own confidence, which she clearly desperately needs. 

Honestly, I bet once she is out on her own for a bit and builds up some confidence, she’ll stop taking a sudden interest in guys you like. That situation with guy #1 and guy #2 seems born out of pure insecurity tbh. "
"I'll echo other commenters' recommendations for therapy — that's everyone's best chance to adjust to this incredible change.

I'd add that you should avoid assuming anything about the girls and how they will adapt. The middle child may be more withdrawn... or she may quickly adjust while the other girls have trouble. Just try to avoid pigeonholing them — as specific personalities, as grieving in any particular way, or otherwise. They will have so much to adapt to (they're changing schools midyear right?) and open acceptance as they process that will be great.

One more thought: find ways to build routines and structure. Weekly family therapy session. Nightly family dinner. Sunday morning pancakes... Kids thrive on routine and it's a good way to give them something secure to hold on to. They're also likely to act out in different ways, maybe you and your partner could also take a course in parenting preteens? 

I'd suggest two books: Parenting from the Inside Out, and How to Talk So Kids Will Listen.

Sending you a bittersweet congratulations on your new found parenthood, and a bravo for taking this on. "

"About all you can do is talk to your brother and describe where you had left all the items (along with the cake pan) and where the bag and pan were found later, so you know that somebody had taken the needles and dyes.  Let him know that if he happens to see them anywhere you would appreciate getting them back. 

Whether they ever get returned or not, never leave anything else in that house if they are coming over.  Lock everything in your car if needed. "
"Take the job. If you don't, you'll regret it forever.

Honestly, he'll either get over it, or he isn't worth your time. You don't need an insecure, misogynistic child of a man holding you down and limiting you just so he can feel like ""a man"" or whatever.

I'd say take the job and tell him to get counseling if he needs help getting over it. If he won't or can't, a divorce lawyer is in order."
"I have a buddy that will call dibs on EVERYONE in a room when we all go out, he'll call dibs and then switch plans when it's not working out, and all other manner of annoying dibs habits that I and our other friend just cannot abide.

So we came up with a few rules; The Dibs Articles

1. If you call dibs, the others must wingman to the best of their ability.

2. You get to call dibs ONCE each outing.

3. If you crash and burn, the girl you called dibs on is fair game and you must become the wingman.

4. If you, whether accidentally or not, swoop someone else's dibs, then you are permanent wingman next outing.

5. You cannot call dibs on someone that one of us has already hooked up with. Assuming it's not a dating or serious situation, it's still fair game, but dibs is off the table.

Lol there's plenty more, but my buddy and I add rules whenever we want just to mess with our other friend.

"Is your boyfriend Lennie from Of Mice and Men? If not, then what he's doing is incredibly thoughtless, at best. At worst, he knows exactly what he's doing, and getting off on it.

I'm a 6'4"" dude who's 280 lbs and have never hurt my partner. You know why? Because I'm not a toddler and have learned to control my body.

If it were me, I'd leave every time this happened. If he can't play nice, then don't play with him."
"LoveIsRespect.org can help.

It's not uncommon for abusers to start ramping up abusive behavior they've previously kept under wraps once marriage and a baby are taken care of, because then you have a harder time leaving.

Get yourself out of the house and back to your parents' place or move in with a friend. Do this BEFORE the baby comes. Start the separation process.

You can't fix abusers. All you can do is leave them. 

**It's not your fault.**"
"to put her immaturity into perspective:  I lost my mom a few years ago, and her husband wasn't even my dad, he's my stepdad.  After she died, he remarried.  His new wife refers to my mom all the time.  She tells me things like how proud she must have been of me, etc.  She even asks me questions about her once in a while.  She's a lovely woman.   Now my step aunt (Stepdad's sister) is also married to a widower who has kids and she sort of set the bar for everyone.  She is very very respectful of her husbands deceased wife.  She does not even call her ""ex wife"" or anything like that, but her name and ""Dave's wife before me or even ""Dave's wife Jan"""".  

&amp;#x200B;

For these reasons, both sets of children are incredibly thankful for the new spouses our parents found and that theres no drama or torment.  

&amp;#x200B;

Your girlfriends age might have something to do with this.  I don't want to say ""dump her"" but it would be nice for you to be with someone who really understands who your wife was to you and your son and how she will always be in your hearts.  Also off topic: go through the house before you move anyone new in, and box up anything that is ""uniquely"" your wive's, so that you can make sure they are kept, their meaning retained, give it to your son when he's older.  Or at least identify those things now.  "
"When my husband cheated, I gave him one get out of jail free card, but made it clear that the second time would be the end. 

He cheated again. I left. 

You can’t threaten to do something and then not do it, because then they take advantage. If you stay with her you will be in debt for the rest of your life. No house, no kids, just bills. "
So you told him it made you feel uncomfortable and he not only disregarded your feelings but also moved up the timing and made it an evening (more date-like) get together? And people are telling you just to trust him? No. He is being a selfish asshole. My guess is this girl doesn’t even know he had a girlfriend.
"Bio-mom... has issues. From what you say, she was forced to give up her child as a teenager and may have never recovered from that. For that reason, I would extend grace to her in my heart, disengage from this interaction and put her on limited profile so that she can’t see what your wife posts, and keep her at arms length. "
"If you were extremely tired, and this was his car, why didn't he drive?"
"I was once married to someone like this. Ended it amicably but oh boy did I feel like maybe I’d done something to deserve it.

You didn’t deserve that. If your husband can go to work and not fly off the handle at work colleagues and friends, he can do the same for you. You should be treating your spouse better than other people, not giving them the worst of yourself. MAYBE if he apologizes unequivocally and takes concrete, self-improvement steps to make things better—this is forgivable.

I’m married to someone else now who has never so much as raised his voice to me. The way he’s treating you is not normal or ok.

If you confront him about it, and he comes up with a bunch of excuses or rationalizations (he was just so angry you’d taken on these dogs, for instance), or he accuses you of being overly sensitive, etc.—do yourself the biggest favor and end this relationship. I seriously tied myself in knots trying to fix what was wrong. It’s not worth it, because in the end I wasn’t the one with the problem."
"please don't stay with someone just because the length of time you've been together. i can only imagine how hard it must be thinking of your life without someone you've spent a large portion of your life with, but that's not a reason to stay with someone who is disrespecting and degrading you. if he can look straight in your eyes and lie to you, what makes you think he's going to change? i'm sorry but he's not changing. he's cheating on you with someone who's married and trying for a child. this man has no boundaries. 

on the bright side, you're not married and you don't have kids. save yourself the humiliation and get out now, OP. its going to be hard. make sure you have a good support system and things to keep you busy. 

so sorry you're going through this. best of luck. "
"You are just hanging out in the wrong part of the internet.

Wanting to be monogamous is much more common than wanting to be poly. 

Don't beat yourself up, just be the best romantic partner you know how to be, that is all anyone can hope for."
"OB nurse here. Your doctor is right, there is no right answer, only a right answer for you. This is one of those times where you have to look deep down and be honest about how you feel, and make a decision that is best for you and your wife and your kids, and your collective future. In my experience, no matter what you choose you will have regrets. 

As an aside, there is no problem if you terminate and want to try again and your wife is 38-39 at delivery. Yes the risk of complications goes up, but it’s an exponential model and it’s not really *probable* that you’ll have complications—especially since it wouldn’t be her first or even second delivery, things tend to go more smoothly. Just slightly more likely at this point. My doc delivered a perfectly healthy 49 year old a few years back (though I don’t recommend waiting that long). When couples terminate for a defect, there is always a fear that their bodies are broken now in some way and every subsequent pregnancy will have a complication. I can assure you I have seen many many women terminate or lose a baby mid or late term and go on to have another completely healthy pregnancy. Don’t let fear be your guide here, do what you think is best for your family. "
"Wait until you would normally announce, then let her know. Honestly I would probably ask her if she still wants you as a bridesmaid because it's extremely likely that you will be literally giving birth (or in the hospital) during her wedding and not able to attend. I wouldn't want a bridesmaid in my party who wasn't positive that they'll be at the ceremony, plus it will make finding matching bridesmaids dresses super difficult. Just saying. "
"If I were you, I'd call my brother and simply say that you need those items back. Now. Like ""hi brother. So, I'm going to need you to bring [specific items] back before I leave at [time]."" then see what he says. I would not mention stealing, I would skip that step and go directly for ""imma need my stuff now"". If he ask why you think he has it, say ""your wife has it, and I didn't want to lend it to anyone. Will it work for you to bring the stuff at [specific time] or do you prefer something else?"" don't ask if they took it or have it, don't ask if you can have it back. Don't ask anything. Simply state that you need it back, don't ask if they can please bring it over or give it back at some point, suggest a specific time for them to bring it, if they can't, then ask for when and get a specific time. No asking, no accusing, no doubt, only statements and demands. "
"I was thinking the same thing! Where will the money go? It almost always 100% goes to bettering the children's lives. It's like he's asking her to stay low, so he can feel good about himself.    This is the saddest Reddit post I've read all day. Its really sad, and depressing. What's worse, is I have a feeling you might not take it, because you love him and do not want to make him upset. What will happen, is your self esteem is going to take a huge hit, and the resentment, is going to be strong. He doesn't want you strong and able to take care of yourself and the children without him. By him asking you not to take it, is a huge red flag, that something isn't right. Such a sad post. Also, congratulations on the promotion, I bet if you take it, your children will be really proud of you. "
"&gt; The trouble is, the last few days I've been missing my late girlfriend a lot. I don't know what's triggered it, but I find myself crying at night, dreaming of her again and just missing her a lot in general.

Talking with the wife, I think you hit the nail on the head here. When I switched college programs it was ""I always knew you would be a scientist, I told you!"" Plus she wanted to move out to wherever I got a job, which might not be possible with recent developments.

&gt; She's probably taking it out on your dad

"&gt;Her landlord is an old, I want to speak to the manager, type of woman

What is this supposed to mean? It's her property, your gf was too immature and disrespectful to follow the rules, why insult the landlord? I have 3 dogs and 2 cats, I adore them, but I totally get why some landlords just don't want to deal with it. It's not uncommon for a pet to do damage and the owner to just bail - your gf sounds like the type to bail. Of course, if the dog does meet legal requirements for the stated purpose then the landlord has to allow it but your gf didn't bother to follow proper procedure. Sounds to me like she's just trying to bullshit her way into getting a dog after agreeing to her landlord's no pet policy.

&gt;She just moved him out yesterday to stow him away at her apartment whilst seeking legal advice to show he is allowed to be there by law.

So she still hasn't followed proper procedure so now she's breaking her landlord's policy, which she agreed to. She's a little shit.

This is dumping territory imo, it's only been 8 months and she sounds like a real pain in the ass."
"Would you consider getting a termination? I think it’s pretty inevitable you will break up, either before or after the baby is born - it’s a question of how long you both are willing to be miserable.

Then as he begged her to marry him, I’d hope she said no. I’d absolutely never believe the story that the whole thing was a skit, and I’d think very poorly of the fiancée for a very long time. Not that believing that it was a skit would make me feel that much better.

Not only does this make you look kinda pathetic, it makes her look like an egomaniacal lunatic."
"&gt;Speaking to the age difference, we met at my workplace, we were acquaintances, occasionally talked over social media, meaning like twice a year. We both lived and still live in separate cities. we were both in and out of relationships at the time and the past few years. We just happened to speak again and hang out. No “grooming” involved. We were never totally interested, did not discuss it. Nothing physical or flirty ever happened until last summer. Our connection simply bloomed when we let it.

To be blunt, this is *exactly* what grooming is and why older men prey on younger women who do not have the life experience to recognize this behavior for what it is. It seems to you that your ""connection simply bloomed when we let it,"" but that is exactly his goal.

But for the sake of argument let's say he wasn't grooming you and the relationship started innocently enough.

**It's not innocent or appropriate now.** He is repeatedly, purposely violating a physical boundary of yours, and often ""play fights"" or wrestles physically. Those are major, *major* red flags for physical abusers. There is no reason to risk staying with someone like that, because frankly there is no reason that a safe &amp; reasonable human would touch you and your feet the way he does, knowing exactly how it makes you feel.

Whether you agree with the grooming aspect or not is irrelevant at this point: run, do not walk, to the nearest exit."
"You might want to check for hidden cameras.  I hate to even suggest it but if he had access to your apartment and you're getting serious prompts from your gut, it's not a bad thing to check out.  Google it and try some of those suggestions but there are also apps and the like for it."
"OP, you're coming off pretty selfish tbh. This is her birthday and she is allowed to invite whoever she wants to her birthday. If she doesn't feel comfortable inviting your bf, then you need to accept that. 

Part of being a friend IMO is being there for the important things in your friends' lives, even when it isn't your cup of tea. You don't have to go to your friend's birthday party, but they may decide to not invite you next time and/or they may decide to not come to your big events because you haven't put in the same effort for them in the friendship. 

What exactly are you doing to manage your anxiety OP? How are you going to survive things like job interviews that require you to talk in-depth about yourself to a complete stranger? How will you survive going to your friends' weddings in the future when they start having them?

Stop making your friend's birthday all about you. It's her big day and she is free to celebrate it the way she wants. If you aren't comfortable celebrating her birthday with her and don't want to go, that's your choice, but don't be surprised if she stops putting effort into the friendship if you continue not putting in effort yourself. "
No he is not even texting me anymore. I said that it seems like a date and that its making me uneasy. And he hasnt replied since.
"Your family is truly awful. At some point in the next few years, you need to make becoming financially independent from them your number one priority. Once you move out and get them out of your life (really, you owe them nothing and should not feel obligated to have a relationship with them after what they have done to you as a child), it will become much easier to get your life on track. You will not have that constant stream of negativity, and you will be able to start therapy to learn how to process the shitty things you have been through in your life.

Try not to place so much value on ""not being a burden."" It's kind of a natural instinct to not want people to feel sorry for you or whatever, but you can't make it through life alone. Sometimes you need people's help, and trying to do everything yourself and bottle everything up is not a viable solution. I bet there is a counsellor at school that is free who you can talk to. It won't fix everything, but it's a start.

"I get incredibly angry if I hear chewing noises, as in legitimate rage. My husband used to be really bad about chewing with his mouth open. I just politely asked him to please chew with his mouth closed (like 7 years ago) and I have to remind him about it once in a while, but he's gotten *much* better. 

Every once in a while he'll get a little defensive about it and say he wasn't chewing with his mouth open. To which I respond: why would I ask you to stop if you weren't. 

My husband was a little hurt when I asked him the first few times but if your fiance cares about you, he'll care that he's bothering you. It's worked for us, I think something like this is definitely better to discuss than to drown out with background sound. Covering it up won't improve anything. "

"Don’t try to change how she feels about herself. Validate her viewpoint, because it’s grounded in reality. You’ve had the police called on you, for Pete’s sake.

I will say from the prospective of someone who was abandoned by their bio-father, and reconnected later, in my case I wish I had never met the guy. And he was only in my life for two years before I went back to having no contact.  I still speak to one of my uncles, and one of my aunts, but only because I have their word that they will not speak of me around my father, his wife, or his children.  Meeting him was a terrible mistake, and I wish I could go back to thinking I was just not good enough to be loved, and that was why he left."

"OP’s not even consistent on this. She says she “puts up with it”, and yet she’s had at least six conversations with him about it in an attempt to change him.

This is his libido, this is who he is. If OP needs more (which is perfectly reasonable), then they are not compatible, period. This isn’t something you “put up with”, nor is it something you pretend to be okay with but then pressure him to change.

Resentment/frustration is just going to continue to build on both sides. And like you said, this issue with the ex is just a manifestation of that."
"&gt;I'm from a culture, and was raised as, that values family more than anything. So, I'm admittedly afraid of cutting ties with them. Especially my parents.

Live your live the way you want to. Be open to the people you meet, and maybe someone will come along or not. That is for you discover in your own time.

"The new suggestion is fair. Private bathroom is a huge amenity.

An actual fair way to decide this kind of thing from the jump is if you don't decide who gets the ""better"" thing beforehand, and each person makes a blind bid on how much they personally would pay to get it. Then you compare both bids, winning bid gets it, and they pay the price they bid."
"I can say that we or I was a bit too fast in terms of moving in with her. But it’s a story for another day. The expenses, utilities, etc. I take care of that (temporarily I hope). Considering now she has jack-diddly-squat, I have to take care of everything money-wise until she gets back on her feet and can start giving me a hand again.

With work, I have 2 jobs but the other one, I have days when I don’t have work on both jobs so that’s the time she calls into work. But now that she’s training and only has atleast 1 or 2 shifts a week, if ever I have no work and she does, she immediately reschedules her shift just so she could stay home. I told her, her last job may (barely) put up with her giving away shifts, but that doesn’t mean she can bring the habit to her new job. As usual, she gets upset and justifies that, she’s still just in training so she can do that. 

I would love to talk to her and have deep conversations but when it goes to the conclusion that it’s her fault, she plays the victim card and walks out of the room, doesn’t talk to me for an hour and says that I always think I’m right"
And her daughter's credit report. 
"Oh, she's a narcissist. I've got experience with those. 

First thing's first: Set the boundary. Tell your parents she is not permitted over anymore. She is not permitted at their house when your baby is there. If they fail to comply, you will revoke visitation to the grandbaby immediately. You don't need to JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain)--they know why. 

Now: Enforce the boundary. If they bring your sister over to their house while your visiting them, leave. Gather baby stuff and leave. Don't make a scene. Don't explain yourself. Just get up, walk out the door. Call them later and tell them that you set a boundary for the good of the child, and if they cannot respect that, they will no longer be able to see the baby. And *follow through*. Don't ever accept their excuse. If you do it ONCE they will think they can get you to do it again.

If they bring your sister to YOUR house, tell her in no uncertain terms that she is not allowed over and that she is to be off your property in 30 seconds or you will call the police and have them remove her.

Your parents are enablers. They think they are keeping the peace but really they are making your sister happy at the expense of you, and that's NOT okay. 

As someone with a narc sister, hang in there. I wish she could say that one day she'll learn the error of her ways, but really--she won't. She'll blame everyone else but her."
How exactly can you trust this person to build a future you want with at this point? She does not seem interested in treating you as an equal in the relationship. 
"1) That therapist is *trash* and she has overstepped. It very much sounds like she and your husband planned the entire discussion and plan and then blasted you with it. That’s not how this works. She should have referred you to another therapist for the marriage. That is not appropriate. I also am not a fan of how she seems to position things here like she’s helping anyone make decisions. 

2) Your husband gets to be confused. He doesn’t get to be cruel. The sex thing is appalling, I’m angry for you. He took advantage of the situation; this isn’t a situation of non-consent, I’m saying that initiating sex with the person you’re leaving who doesn’t want you to leave is *gross*, cruel, manipulative and horrible. He should leave your home. 

See a lawyer OP and see one NOW. I understand you know your husband well. I also see a lot of weirdness here and I think you are dealing with someone who will cry and grieve with you, while making damn sure they come first. *You need to advocate for yourself now*. Get ahead of the situation or you will find yourself behind in those proceedings thinking there might have been something to salvage when there wasn’t. Get to a lawyer. Do not see that therapist again. You got this. Own the situation. He doesn’t call the shots. You both do. "

3. They're very messy and are embarrassed over the state of their home

4. They spend all their time at home, never get to go out because of their kid, so when the option comes to get out of the house for a little they take it.

Regardless just tell them you don't want to host every time."
"&gt; If you don't leave him, there's a good chance that his ""passion"" (or violent temper) will be turned on YOU at some point. This is not healthy.

Have her talk to your mom

"Or if you know the recipient would enjoy the planning and such, or you want to get their input, you at the very least give them criteria to work with. ""I want to take you on a road trip to wherever you want to go"" vs ""I want to take you for a weekend trip on a tropical beach"" vs ""I'm treating you to 3 weeks in Europe."" Or if you're completely open but on a budget, say that. ""I want to take you on a vacation you'll love. I've budgeted about $XXX for the trip, but I want you to choose exactly what you want to do.""  Jeeze. You can't expect your partner to read your mind. I hate people who do this covert contract bullshit."
"Does your boyfriend make a habit of excluding you?  We have no history. This would be a big“fuck you” if there were no other incidents like this and I would definitely want to have a conversation with him about why he excluded you and couldn’t even bother  to communicate basic plan changes with you. If he has done this before, well, then that’s the boyfriend you are with and you shouldn’t have been that surprised by all of this. "
Go ahead and propose anyway. Her opinion is the one that matters. 
"Why can’t you just say “you keep telling me things cost less than they do, what’s up with that”."
"&gt;And do you have any tips to better help her socialize so people will get to know us and stop assuming the worst?

Clothing is a really easy way to signify age. 

I've never seen a teenage girl wearing an elegant wool coat with a stylish silk scarf. 

If she habitually wears jeans and t-shirts, casual athleisure, sneakers, I'd bring up updating her wardrobe to either business casual to formal. The one downside is that this will be pretty expensive -- however if you're comfortable, you could offer to pay for half her new wardrobe. "
"The only foolproof way to get rub-my-neck people (I know, I'm one of them) to stop asking for neck and back rubs is to start requesting equal time. Ok, my turn! 

Nothing sucks the pleasure out of a back rub more than the knowledge that you're going to have to reciprocate. Do that a couple times and I promise this problem will go away."
"She needs, at the very least, a home care aide. Your grandpa is (a) not at home 24/7 and (b) probably not up to the task of helping her with some of this stuff, given his age and her size. She needs a professional."

Thats sexual coercion and is not consent."
"Ask her if that is literally the only reason she asked. I doubt it is, but if so, let her know there are other ways to rebel and that you value your friendship more than that. 

If she says she has feelngs for you like that, I'd suggest maybe taking it slow so you don't put strain on your friendship with rash moves.

Good luck out there."
"Is that emotional labor?  
     
I feel like it is, but I keep confusing emotional labor with plain ol sexism."
That's....really scary. Like he was baiting her.
"Man. If you weren't with such a tool you could be planning the trip of a lifetime instead of complaining about The World's Worst Boyfriend (seriously). What a joy suck.

How much of your joy will you allow him to suck? 7 years? 10 years? You'll be in your 30s then. Yikes "
"“I’m telling you this because if it was me I would want to know. You often seem to one-up people and seem to not listen to them, and some people simply give up and walk away. It’s a problem. Have you noticed?” 
You say it gently. This is a big one; say direct words, direct but gentle and kind tone. Make big time eye contact. Hold onto her hands if you can or be touching her in some way; focus her in. 

There is no way to bring it up in such a way as to avoid hurt feelings, it sucks to reflect on those past actions but reflection and correction is what she needs. 

Be quick to reassure her about her current strengths, but don’t minimize the current situation.  “You’re a great friend and I know you want people to feel heard.” "
"Not just shitty - a clear sign you are in an emotionally abusive relationship.

The solution isnt to stop telling her, it's to leave."
"How do your other roommates feel about this situation? I'm only asking because what I'm about to suggest will be much easier if you can do it together with your roommates as a group, but I think it's perfectly fine to do it on your own if they're not bothered. I would just sit Becky down the next time you can get her alone, and calmly explain what you typed here. That you don't mind her boyfriend coming over often, but that you specifically picked a place with X number of bathrooms and were under the impression you would only have 3 roommates and now you basically have four. Not to mention him having keys and you not knowing him well is a liability (and possibly maybe goes against your lease, but I don't know). 

&amp;#x200B;

I would first ask if you could all come together as a group and determine some guidelines for how often everyone should be able to have overnight guests over, or you could ask if you're comfortable with the boyfriend paying rent, as he's essentially living there for free and presumably also using the water and electricity so it's only fair he start chipping in. If she refuses, then I guess you could appeal to your other roommates and see what they think about all this and maybe try to summon the power of majority to make decisions as household on this topic. If it only bothers you then I guess you can either wait it out until they either break up or move in together, or find a new place to live, even though those are crap options. "
"Remind him that he is a groan ass adult and that you are not his mom.

What a fucking baby.

obviously you can do this gently... or not"
"I think you need to call her doctor. Now. 

Your wife is under *enormous* physical and psychological stress. There is a very, very short list of circumstances that will make me empathize with someone who lashes out like this, but this is on it. She needs medical attention first, and an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist second. This is a frightening shift and she’s clearly in no condition to care for herself right now. You’re going to have to step up, and step in. "
"*Goodfellas* covered this scenario already:

"" It was like he had two families. The first time I was introduced to all  of them at once, it was crazy. Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons  and nephews. And almost all of them were named Peter or Paul. It was  unbelievable. There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding. Plus, they were all married to girls named Marie. And they  named all their daughters Marie. By the time I finished meeting  everybody, I thought I was drunk."""
"Pull it up on a screen, show him the figures, done. He doesn't have to have access to see the information.

It's reasonable to want to know. Remember, marriage is the bigger picture and it's good to have the details clear. You don't have to surrender the details on that account."
"&gt; They do this often and I don't understand why

Girl it doesn't matter why at this point, you need to stop living in the delusion they WILL turn up or keep their plans. You're only hurting yourself. No, they don't want to have a family lunch with you, no, they don't want to spend time with you, honestly, doesn't sound like they like you very much for whatever reason.

Does that all suck? Do we feel bad for you? Of course!

But you need to start living in your reality, which is that you can't buy your family with food. They are dysfunctional and they don't want to spend time with you. The sooner you accept this, regardless of the 'why,' the sooner your life will improve. It's not about how good or bad your cooking is, this is just the way your family is. Waste your money making lunch for them a dozen more times, you're not going to get what you want from them."
"Your girlfriend has no idea what emotional abuse is if that's what she thinks.

If anything, sounds like she's trying to guilt you into staying awake for her."
I’m trying to do that! But now he’s so upset because he thinks I won’t be happy not going to Aruba. I really don’t understand it. I’m happy with whatever he gives me. Obviously. And he thinks I’m some sort of complainer but I’m not. I’m never not satisfied about stuff like this.
"Lol, no... I have a 2009 Prius bought used and is paid for.  Despite student loan, and my mortgage— this car is the third credit line I’ve taken out...

I think we can cut down on other joint costs.  Go without Comcast and hang with Hulu and Netflix (that I also pay for).  We’d save 60-80/month that way.

But I’m irritated, honestly.  I’m not well off by any means.  I funded this car at the expense of funding my retirement.  He makes a third beyond what I do, and I pay much more than he does.  What’s the solution?  I feel like it’s fair to say— ‘Make some damn sacrifices!’  Seriously, I love him— but who the fuck does he think he is?  It’s ridiculous???"
You are now the annoying ex in your boyfriends life.He just hasn’t gotten round to telling you.
"Oh, and the obvious reply to his suggestion would also be: if he's the only one on the lease, then he's the only one paying the mortgage as well. 

Plus if he wants her to have ZERO say about the house, even if she lives in it, he can't ask her for rent, either. Because renters have rights, too."
"&gt;a lot of people like the sound or the breeze it makes.

I bet you there's hundreds of youtube videos called ""fan noise for 10 hours"" that she could try to at least attempt to solve the noise problem. Add lighter blankets into the mix (so she doesn't get hot) and maybe they'll get somewhere. "
"&gt;How can I get him to accept he is being unreasonable and go back to being good roommates for the next 2 weeks?

You can't. And even if you could, why bother?

This is what we call a ""run out the clock situation."" He's obviously being a hypocritical idiot, and the kind of stupid jealousy you describe here runs bone-deep. If you couldn't fix him while you were dating for 2.5 years, how on earth can you expect to make him become a reasonable person in two weeks?

Survive for two weeks and then enjoy having this idiot in your rear-view mirror."
"To add on to this, if your siblings also have items there, make sure to coordinate with them and all three of you get your stuff at the same time. Otherwise your mother might decide to destroy/trash whatever is left behind after the first visit."
"What you’ve described is a mental health issue. Your wife needs therapy to address these issues; it’s far more complicated than simply having too much stuff. Instead, it may be that she sees her stuff as a physical extension of her, and by throwing stuff out you’re actually throwing her out. 

She needs professional help. If she refuses to get it, you have to choose whether you’ll tolerate the situation or whether you will leave. "
"&gt; she made a snarky comment that she would put that to better use than me since I have no time or ""professional"" training like her (I just had baby, hence the ""no time"") I brushed it off as just her being her and even offered to buy her a set of dyes once my economy was a little better and she actually agreed. 

Also - stop offering to buy her things after she low-key insults you. She treats you poorly and presumably has her own money. You owe her nothing."
You two seriously need to do a budget together.  Does he even know about the property tax?  Had he adulted before you got married?  
"Take what I say with a grain of salt because it is not ALWAYS true, but It's still quite dodgy. If you browse this sub you'll see a great deal of posts of women in their very early 20s complaining about their 30 year old partners not respecting them, being immature or abusive, or downright terrifying. The most common reason a 30 year old dates someone who was recently a teenager is because they are likely too immature or disrespectful for a woman their age to stand being with, so they prey on younger women who won't have that experience or understanding of relationships due to age.

I would strongly consider some outside help/opinions on it, potentially just a single therapy session, to see if the things you mention spark worry in a professional. *These things are looked down upon and treated as creepy scenarios for a reason*"
Abusers never see themselves as the problem.
"If you're in the UK you can call 101 anytime to speak to the non-emergency police; they take action, create a case etc as normal. "
He absolutely does not want a *partner*.
"Each time he tries to say why he doesn't like it, just respond with ""I really like it, I love (insert whatever he hates that you're happy with). But if you wanna change it, just let me know!""

He's clearly not interested in problem solving as he wasn't jumping to buy anything together, so if he gets to share his opinion on the space, so do you- and you're happy! If he wants changes its time for him to take initiative, as you can't lead him through something that you're not even worried about.

You can't be responsible for his dream house, it's time for him to figure out what that means to him since he's the one not happy."
"&gt;He also told me he could sue me and 'destroy me in court' for getting an abortion without his permission. 

He can’t sue you for having an abortion. You don’t require anyone’s permission to get one. He’s full of shit.

Get the abortion and consider your relationship over. He verbally and physically abused you. "
People are having such a knee jerk reaction to something that is really not all that common. They act like people are just terminating full term babies for funsies. 
Also maybe speak to your parents before they get attached to a baby that isn't related. 
"That bothered me as well. The guy went over, saw that she didn't want to talk to him, and stayed there while they gathered their stuff... That's not super normal. If you're unwanted, you leave, you don't stick around for a confrontation. It's really odd that he tried to force her to interact with him."
"Here’s the thing. Maybe his parents are terrible. But what you witnessed was 1 person raging against 2 other people who were being passive. 
He then addresses it with you, confirming some awareness that what just went down was public. 
When you show obviously discomfort/unwillingness to call his dad names he pushes it further which is weird.

This all suggests someone who may not have boundaries when it comes to rage. If this is the first time you’ve seen him angry it’s such a major red flag because you can’t say “he gets particularly odd with his parents”. You just don’t know. The thing is,  you can’t risk finding out if you’ll ever be on the receiving end of that rage-attack. 

It sort of sounds like a nightmare out of a chick flick... “Just gonna call my dad real quick” :) .... “$@&amp;/*#” "
Agreed. Hair can get everywhere and anywhere. I think the issue is that OP still clearly hasn't recovered the trust they lost when their SO cheated years ago.
"&gt;I don’t need him to pay the prop tax or insurance or whatever.  I just need him to be okay with a 40/60 arrangement on his fucking XT.

STOP. What he is doing isn't fair on you, and he knows it. Make a spreadsheet. Write down aaaaaall the numbers. You should be paying joint expenses equal to what you make - he makes 60k and you make 40k? Then bills, property tax, groceries, etc. get paid 60:40. This is fair because it gives you both the same amount of ""fun"" money and the same potential for savings/retirement. His car? His payments. Your car? Your payments. He wants to pay less for his car? Should have got a cheaper car."
Well I don't know your boyfriend but I think that sounds cute and I'd do it.
Your boyfriend sounds really unappealing. He invited someone into your home who stole from you and he doesn't care at all? That's really strange. 
"I'll preface this by telling you I am a very old man. You could be my grand daughter.

Why are you, at 18, partnering up for an exclusive relationship with someone that doesn't make you all swooney?

Go out and experience life, have some adventures, push yourself, read and grow, get really really good at some things, like your job and really rally really good at relationships. Learn relationship skills and how to really read someone and communicate very well. Learn how to give and get extremely good satisfaction in a relationship

then maybe you will feel better about being exclusive.

"&gt;he can’t help how he acts in the mornings.

He can, he just doesn't want to.  Good for you for sticking up for yourself."
"Yeah I feel something has to be going on with his end. Personally I also hate getting gifts, because I know myself better than others and just buy what I want. However to go behind her back and return it is weird (I mean how did he think he could get around without her knowing he returned her (keyboards are pretty easy to notice being gone)). I think he has some extra hangups when it comes to gifts."
"My husband is Albanian. We are sitting in Tirana at the moment. But over the years we have traveled all over the country together. He thinks similarly to you and certain things (like going on jogs or going to a store) he will *always* accompany me. 

He recognizes the dangers of the country but simultaneously wants me to learn, enjoy, and see it as well. 

We hiked up to his village one time (no drivable roads) and the worst thing we might have encountered was a wild dog. 

I don't know what city you are speaking of. But I've thoroughly enjoyed seeing my husband's home country. I would feel sad if he thought I was too 'sheltered' and couldn't handle it. 

The history is tough and the people have suffered over centuries. Hoxha didn't help anything with his regime and the absolute corruption he brought on. 

I would suggest you give your wife some more credit here. I grew up in a safe city in the US too. I have never felt weird or annoyed at what I've seen in Albania."
"My thoughts exactly, his fragile masculinity isn't OP's problem to solve, but maybe with her fancy new job she can buy him some therapy to help him deal with it.

I feel bad for the husband that his sense of worth is so linked to this specific metric of success, but also how selfish? Don't be successful, do with less to protect my ego.

Also, he's already emasculated because she's been offered the job. "
"You can't do this without causing an argument, but I think it will be worth it. He has a good thing going right now, of course he's going to be upset that his meal service is going to end. 

If he tries to turn this around to you being selfish, don't cave. Don't try to justify, argue, defend or explain your decision (well explaining once is reasonable, but after that). Just keep telling him: I'm tired of being the only one cooking for both of us, so I'm going to just cook for myself from now on. 

Almost any meal can be made only for one (source: I cook for only myself). The trick is that you have to measure your ingredients so you get the same proportions as in a bigger batch. You don't want to create leftovers because he'll probably eat them. You can buy bigger batches of raw ingredients and freeze those for the next meal to save money though.

One thing: if he actually wants to start cooking for the both of you, you have to accept that the results aren't going to be that good at first. It's hard for experienced cooks to imagine how intimidating cooking can be for people who aren't used to it. If he does cook for you, don't criticize him, just thank him for the meal. Only give advice if he asks for it. Otherwise he's going to feel like it's a no-win situation: either he cooks and gets criticized, or you cook and complain. "
"Are you positive that this person actually exists, and that they're not just squatting in your home because they became homeless?"
If he wanted me to stay with him why he didn’t just say that instead of taking me through the loops acting like i abandoned him
"i would guess that this is why his previous relationship was ""toxic,"" and when you get fed up you'll be ""toxic"" too."
This is the most important question.
"Stop talking to your mom and sister about this if they can't respect your ""no"". Walk away/hang up from any conversation where they mention this. They clearly don't respect you and your boundaries, so make your boundaries even more clear by getting some distance."
It's more of a red flag that a 32 year old wants to date a 20 year old. I am 25 and 20 would be on the very low end for me so that strikes me as very odd. 
"My dad ran off to the nurse to name my big brother, the second he was born. My mom was in bed recovering so she didn't catch him. He gave him a name my mom absolutely hated, and its been 20+ and she never forgave him for it. My dad once told me he regretted doing it, and if he could go back and give my bro another name my mom liked, he would. That's how unhappy and disappointed she was. Don't bend to your husband, find a name you both like instead, trust me. "
"&gt;I’m making an assumption here, but I’d point out that the child will already be getting his (and his father’s) surname, no?

Oh, I like where this is going. :)

If the baby is going to have the FIL/husband's same last name, then technically speaking, he's already been named after the FIL. 

That being said, I agree with the other posters. You have outlined your very sound reasons why this is a bad idea. That your husband is doubling down on the rhetoric is concerning. I also would make sure that I was on the highest birth control pills that I could tolerate and get you both into counselling ASAP. 

"
"My husband needs a fan on to sleep because he needs the white noise and the air flow.  I have no issue with the noise but used to have problems with the cold and the sensation of air hitting me.  Our solution is that he has the fan on his side of the bed, angled to point at him, and I use extra blankets.  It's fine.  I don't mean to be flippant, but have you tried using more blankets and maybe wearing heavier PJs?  Has your fiancee tried keeping the fan on her side of the bed pointed just at her?  Separate bedrooms is also a possibility.  Y'all could still cuddle before going to bed.  This might be a case of - would you rather share a cold, uncomfortable bedroom with your fiancee so you don't have to sleep alone or have your own bedroom that you could keep warmer?

Also, I think I'd try to reframe this in your mind as something other than an ""obsessive habit."" I don't know about your fiancee, but for my husband, needing a fan on isn't a ""habit.""  He feels physically uncomfortable without the air flow and colder temperature and legitimately can't sleep without it."
"Your best friend is making a decision to be with this psychopath, so aside from supporting her best interests, there's not much you can do. If your best friend were here asking for advice, I could write paragraphs upon paragraphs, but as for you? There's nothing *you* can do except to accept that your best friend made her decision. "
"No no no. No ""why isn't he helping"", why isn't he RAISING -HIS- kids???"
"That concerned me too. I saw her face and she definitely looked shocked/scared/panicked, almost had that deer in headlights look. When I looked at him as he was walking over to her, he didn't seem to notice or care (?) that she looked panicked. But that panic turned to angry really quickly. "
"When my husband and I first started dating, he had just purchased a house as well. When I moved in, I paid a portion of the mortgage but we had an agreement that he would pay me back some proportion of the money I paid into the investment if we broke up. 

When we got married, we did a quit claim on the house so our married partnership became the owners.

If he is your landlord (you pay rent with nothing to show for it) he should take on the usual burden of a landlord - repairs, renovations, property tax and so on.

If he wants you to share in those homeowner expenses, you should have an arrangement that is more fair to you."
"&gt;The girlfriend was pissed. She felt that we disrespected her because we didn't have solid plans for lunch, when she was coming over for lunch. I gave her my standard excuse that i didn't know it wasn't socially acceptable to do lunch on the fly, but she wasn't having it. She gave me an ultimatum to clean up my act, or she's leaving.    


You (and your mom) didn't do anything wrong. Of course it's perfectly acceptable to do lunch ""on the fly"". If it were the case that you couldn't find anywhere to eat and you were searching for ages just to find a place, maybe she would have a point. But you found somewhere nice within minutes, right? So what possible difference could it make to her whether you booked it in advance or just happened to wander in to a place? She still had lunch with you and your mom, which was the whole point of the visit.    



She sounds very high maintenance and this relationship doesn't sound worth it. Also, don't stay with someone who gives you an ultimatum like ""change your whole personality to suit ME or I'm gone.""   


Just let her be gone.

"Yeah, this dog is gonna end your relationship. "

"I know this will get downvoted.

Reddit is very, very quick to push going no contact with family members. 

You're both adults now and it seems like the only problems you've mentioned with your sister happened when you were children. 

If there is any possibility for reconciliation I would urge you to pursue that first. Maybe there is stuff you left out and your sister is generally a terrible person, but maybe things are different. I don't know enough from a few paragraphs but I'm not going to jump to ""tell your sister you never want to see her again.""

I want to be clear I'm not saying ""don't go no contact"" or put down a hard line in the sand - your family, your call. Just be sure you given it a honest effort to work things out so you can do that with no regrets."

I am glad you are taking some responsibility and getting help. That said, for your wife's own safety I would still encourage her to leave. You've admitted in this thread that when you split you are not in control. She is in danger so long as she stays around you right now.

A physical separation would be a very good idea while you get some help, and she can figure out what she wants to do long-term. I would suggest *at least* six months, perhaps a year.

"
Him saying “don’t move then” says to me that he already sees the end of this relationship and it doesn’t bother him. 
"She’s gay. The way you described how fast she ran towards her first same sex interaction is textbook “exiting the closet”. 

Lawyer up. Stop fixing everything. Stop spreading yourself so thin, and allowing a depressed, mentally ill, closeted person from taking advantage of your good will. Get a therapist yourself and take care of yourself.

I am bisexual, so I am not a gay hater or anything of the sort. I’ve been in a relationship similar to this, and if your relationship ends anything like mine did, it’ll be with you in pieces and no one helping fix you. You already mentioned that no one asked how *you* felt when the super duper breakup happened between the two. Then she was upset over someone she’s known for two months versus her partner of nine years. Amigo, I say this as politely as I can *HUGE RED FLAG, TAKE OFF THE ROSE COLORED GLASSES BEFORE YOU GET MORE HURT*.

Best of luck. "
"Okay - gonna be harsh here - don't you think this is best for her husband in the long run? If she's as much of a mess as you describe, won't he be better off with someone else, as well?

"&gt; So now I'm hiding a part of myself from her, which can't be anything but bad down the road.

"Yes, we both want them out. My husband is concerned that we may have to physically remove them from our property. They smoke outside but the stench is now all over my couches and bed that they are using.

Yeeeah I don't think that's a joke.
"Yes!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻 
Totally listen to your wife OP. 
It is horrible feeling alone and having no friends when you’re a mum. We relocated when our son was 6months old. I was contemplating suicide because I was so lonely. We were also ‘living in paradise’ but let me tell you, it’s not paradise at all when your partner goes to work all day and you’re stuck with a baby and no friends. It’s easy for OP to love it because it reduces financial pressure for him, he is busy with work and gets satisfaction from that while probably being set up to make friends through work. Your wife literally has to put herself out there endlessly to try and develop friendships, find things to do and maybe isn’t feeling overly mentally stimulated. 
Maybe you could take more trips back home or help her find some more baby friendly activities? "
"You accept that you're choosing a life with him over your dream of having kids and you accept that it's worth it because having a life with him is what you want most. If you can't trust yourself to not resent him down the line because you know you want kids, then honestly, IMO you're just avoiding the inevitable and one day, you'll end up both husband-less because of how toxic the marriage has become and kid-less because it'll have been too late.

You can try solo counseling to help yourself come to terms with the idea that you will never have a baby to raise of your own. "
This is exactly how I explained it to him. Turning things into a cold war is absolute insanity. We should voice our issues with our partners or it can't work.
"A hospital in my city does specific types of surgeries, I just don't want to say too many details on Reddit.

"&gt;“Oh come on, it’s been a long time! Long enough to get over our breakup. You have a cute baby, what’s their name? We have almost 2-year-old named “Thomas”!”

He was definitely baiting her! Who the hell says this in response to an ex who very plainly states and LOOKS like she wants nothing to do with him. And after she audibly says ""don't give him any personal information about us"" as they're approaching?

Woah woah woah, there's way more to unpack here ""than hubby did something weird at our kid's birthday party"" and into something big and dangerous. He doesn't value the relationship between you and your family, or the relationship between your family and the child you made with him. And where do you fit into this? He left you behind at the party - does this mean he doesn't view you as family &amp; don't get to be a part of that togetherness?

"Change the password. 7.50 is really not that much to pay for internet. You asked constantly for him to pay your back and he’s and adult and this is on him, not you.

"If people were terrible all the time, then no one would have a problem distancing themselves from them. They'd take one look and go ""oh, he often humiliates people he loves for no reason"" and they'd walk the other way.

People like your husband aren't bad all the time. You just have to decide if the bad outweighs the good. Do you like how you feel right now? Do you like the person you've become? Do you like how he treats you when he's in a ""bad"" mood? Think about this very seriously and maybe try writing down how you feel. 

If he comes at you tomorrow with ""sorry, I was just stressed, come home"", is that going to fix the way your life has been going? Is it going to make up for his behavior? 

How do you treat your friends? Family? Loved ones? Do you ever put them down or make them feel badly about themselves? If you don't, why would he? If you saw a loved one being put down like that, how would you react? What would you think of that person?

If you've talked about this to him and he still does it, why do you think that is? How many times will you allow this behavior to continue? What if his children start doing it? Will it be acceptable? How will you enforce a rule of respect with them if they see their father act this way?

Maybe staying with a friend or family member for a few days will help you see things a little clearly. Don't thi k about what you stand to lose, but about what you want your life to feel like. "
Holy hell. I'm so sorry. 
"I am a woman with larger breast and I know for me I always thought small breast are nicer. Mostly because of the not always having to wear a bra. So she probably already doesn't like her own breast, theres nothing wrong with being honest but be very very sweet about it. I personally have already decided that after I have my child that I am going to get a breast reduction in he future. If it does bother her back she should definitely get a reduction done. Every woman I have ever met who has had that done because of their back was so much happier afterwards. Also you are going to have to be honest she figured it out. Be sweet and good luck"
"I will say that when he skips like two days at the gym, his muscles become noticeably smaller. For whatever reason (I don't know a lot about nutrition) he loses all of his ""gains"" really quickly.

"I think OP's friend is trying to make herself feel better, too. She says she wants forgiveness, but here's what she really wants: she wants OP to tell her everything's fine, and then she can walk away guilt-free, absolved of any wrong-doing. In the meantime, OP gets to re-live all the hurt of losing her BF and BFF.

She just wants to hand off her pain."

"This seems very bizarre.  

It's exceedingly strange, both because of the Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde aspect, and because he used the speakerphone so you could hear him cursing and screaming at his mother and father.  

He *wanted* you to hear.  He was *staging a performance* for your benefit.

I'd be unnerved, too.  Especially when he pressured you to agree with his unwarranted opinion about his father being  ""a fucking dick.""

He clearly wanted you to be aware of this side of his personality.  

The fact that he was comfortable, even *happy and eager* to display this very unpleasant aspect of himself would give anybody pause.  

There's a parallel here to the kind of person who gets off on treating a waiter or store clerk poorly.  Who doesn't care they are making a scene and embarrassing themselves.  Who gets a sick pleasure from power-tripping and hurting people.

"I don’t know what you should do but I don’t think you should discount what she’s said and her reactions as just her being ‘crazy’.

I got out of an abusive relationship about 7 years ago and from what I’ve seen/heard, he’s completely changed his life around and is a much better person but that doesn’t erase my pain and what he did to me. I could never just have him casually come up to me and act like everything is okay and be okay. There’s a chance your boyfriend will never harm you but it’s very likely that he did harm her, and realistically are you able to accept that he is capable of that even if he never hurts you?"

"Well, honestly, do you have a peep hole on your door? I’d just not answer the door when he knocks. We are taught to follow an unwritten social contract when interacting with people which makes us feel we HAVE to answer the door when home.

“You seem very friendly, but to be honest I have a lot on my plate and am not going to be available to hang out or make new friends. This is nothing against you specifically, thanks for understanding, I have to go!”

Then close the door. Remember “No.” is a complete sentence and don’t try to justify or explain. You aren’t available to be friends. Simple. "

If he cancels on his own, I feel like he’s the type of person to still make you feel guilty about it. "

Exactly.   And it is no doubt a violation of her employment contract.  Reporting this has nothing to do with ""going behind her back"".

"Honestly, he had to have known he wasn't 6'2"", three inches is quite a big difference. He's average height and all this talk about his supposed 6' 2"" height giving him all that confidence is sort of strange. I understand that men are unfairly judged if they are really short, but I don't think most people differentiate between someone who is 5'11 vs 6'2"".

"A lot of the commenters thus far are debating if these are even red flags or not, but what I notice is that at this stage - typically the honeymoon period - there wasn't a single thing about him that you seem enthused about. You frankly just don't seem that into him, and for that reason alone you should probably end it. At two months into a relationship you should be gushing about him, not finding faults that typically harsh internet strangers won't even confirm are red flags for you."
"Like a lot of advice here, you're not actually mad about stand up. You're mad about everything else in this marriage. I came to put in my two cents because I relate to you. 

My ex and I separated somewhat recently. I was constantly on his case to be more communicative and, sadly, be more affectionate and considerate. We broke up because we were unhappy. But now he knows how to knit? Since when??? I got so irrationally mad about him acquiring a skill out of the blue when really I was mad about our entire relationship. It was kind of embarrassing. Like I was legit so mad for a few days when a friend bad to sit me down and say ""genjen97, you're just bitter about the relationship and all the things that could have been.""

So, you're not crazy. You're just pointing at the wrong thing to be mad at.

"You have an opportunity to *possibly* confirm what she's been telling you. I'd say to go for it. I've seen a lot of my relatives deal with cheaters - and have had a brush with it myself - and I can assure you, if you *don't* read what's there, the worry about what *might* be will keep digging away at you.

And cheaters *lie*. Constantly. It *never* stops.

It's worth knowing for sure.

*But.*

You *need* to go into this knowing you're going to reopen old wounds this way. You're going to see exactly what they said to each other during this time. If you do this, you *need* to go in there knowing that if you *don't* find any new information, you *don't* get to hold the texts against her, even though it'll hurt you just to see them. You've already agreed not to. So you need to go into it knowing that that kind of bitter confirmation is a *good* thing.

Yet... there's still a third option. 

That you won't find anything *at all*. 

You need to be prepared for that, too. Because if that's the case, then you're right back here to where you started, only you'll be feeling a bit worse about it. Don't run away with *that*, either.

No matter what you find, it's going to hurt. But there's a chance that what you find will give you some peace amidst the pain. Prepare yourself properly, and it'll be worth it."
"Sorry, this might sound like a stupid question but...enabling her is a bad thing, right?"
"I thought this too. 6 months is a very short amount of time for him to be telling her what to do with her money, especially in the condescending way he did it. If he were legitimately concerned about her enabling her brother he could've spoken about it like an adult."
"His muscles getting smaller visibly will be due to loss of swelling due to exercise (“pump”), which is normal. This happens to everyone. Muscle cramps you can see under his skin sounds weird and not normal. If these symptoms are real, he should see a doctor, but tbh I’m inclined to think he’s being over dramatic and somatising.

Lots of people work out a lot and don’t treat their loved ones like shit. This is not a reason for why he’s treating you this way."
"I've had a similar situation come up. My ""enemy"" went so far as to start dating my best friend in the office and then dripping poison in his ear about me. Things to know:  

- She probably has very good social and office politics skills. People who behave badly on the level she does usually do so because they've historically been able to get away with it. She probably has lots of experience 'ruining' people, so to speak. 
- She probably is a bit unstable. This also contributes to bad behavior. 
- You are probably the only person she is targeting. She's probably making sure to get everyone else on her side (in line with her flirting with management). 

My advice, unless you're someone who's really good at office politics, is to gray rock her. Don't confront her face to face. Be nice to her, but don't give her anything she can use against you. At the same time, if you do have friends, now's the time to keep them on your side. Be extra nice to them, make sure any issues you have with them are ironed out. But be aware that all of your friends might become her friends as well. 

Honestly, and this sounds horrible, but the best strategy for you might be to let her 'win'. For her, 'winning' might just be occupying the center of attention. It might be better to let her have that than to keep being in the bulls-eye of a crazy, somewhat psychopathic personality.

"I'm waiting for the horror story of how husband spends all her money once he grants her access.

He already knows the details and amounts of her finances.  He wants access to it ""just to view it on his dashboard"".  Yeah right."
"You just said you're not willing to wait. So...it seems like you have your answer.

You listed a whole lot of negative things...is there anything you love about this person or has the relationship simply run its course and you hung in because you've been together so long, you didn't want to feel like you wasted all these years together?

One session of therapy is not going to change her. It might take months or years for you to see the changes that you hope she will make, and at the end of the day, the person she becomes may *still* not be the person you want to spend your life with.

General life advice: if you're going to get married, marry the person they *are* not the person you *want* them to be. That never works. If who she is is not who you want to be with, then don't get married. Also, is she seeing a therapist because *she's* tired of feeling the way she does or because you will leave if she doesn't go?"
"Read in your comments that it's been 14 days? That's way too soon to feel this way. Also, you found him, not the other way around... so, at his age, he might care to have a relationship with you but not to share it with anyone else and you need to be ready for that."
"Paying someone else’s mortgage without having a stake in the property is basically what you do when renting... so to me it’s not that big of a deal in itself.

I would, however, have a look at what the rental cost would be for, say, one room with a housemate in a similar property in your area. If you’re paying less than /the same as that figure I’d be fine with it, but if you’re paying a lot more then maybe have a conversation about it."
"Yeah, I always sleep with a fan on now.  It's 100% a white noise thing for me, nothing to do with the temperature or airflow.

"My parents hated each other. They didnt fight, but that's because they didnt talk. The house was cold and they never spent time together even though they lived in the same house. They were both great parents to me and my sister, but I could see they weren't happy. I was ten when my parents got divorced. I have no memories of them being happy together. What I do have are infinite happy loving memories of both my parents with their new partners. Both my parents remarried to absolutely lovely people and I could not imagine not having my step dad, or step mom, and my step brothers in my life. Because my parents divorced, me and my sister were able to see what healthy, happy functional relationships look like. And it was probably the best thing that happened to our family looking back. I was not a  ""victim"" of divorce but rather because of divorce I got the opportunity to see beautiful relationships that I used as learning foundations for me and my future relationships (I am now grown and married mysef). And I was granted new family that I never would have met otherwise. Divorce wont ruin your children's life, it would be hard and they wouldnt understand...for a while. But it would get better. Living the rest of your life in a lovless marriage with a person you dislike (and children pick up on this, just like I did as a child), will not do them any favors. "
This goes beyond 'assholey belief' and straight into 'genuinely delusional about reality' territory. 
"Yes, this is what I thought as well but my gut is telling me to get away. He also had access to my apartment while I was away for 10 days in October, and I asked him to feed my cat. That has left a pit in my stomach for some time now."
"I think you need to hold off on getting married until you've figured this out. You say you trust her, but you then say you don't want them to go away together without a chaperone, so actually you don't trust her. You need to have a proper conversation about their relationship and yours, not just about a holiday. You need to get some clarity on what the deal is with them, and then figure out whether you believe her, and if you don't believe her there's no point marrying her. "

"This story is horrific. I'm so sorry that happened to you.

"While I think breaking up was the right decision, ending a 6 year relationship over email is brutally cold. That's the behavior of a corporate overlord, not a committed romantic partner. If it happened to me, even if the writing is on the wall, I would feel discarded, angry, and devastated.  I think you would too, if roles were reversed and you had just finished begging her to not break up with you, just for her to fire off an email a few weeks later ending things without a conversation.  Saying you had to do it this way because you can't ""trust yourself"" to do it over the phone or in person is like hearing someone explain that they hired a maid to clean for them because they just can't trust themselves to clean after themselves.  Come on, be an adult and own your shit.

As far as the friends go, that really comes with the territory and was entirely predictable.  No one cares about your intra-couple drama.  No one's interested in the he-said-she-said.  You left town, she didn't, she gets to keep the friends.  She can even point to your letter as pretty believable proof that you're the bad guy, and it's like lubricant in closing the door on you.  She's also got more of a need for their support than you do, considering she was the one who was unexpectedly dumped, and the method you chose to convey that to her."
"The fact that you've never been able to make friends with a woman (other than a friend's gf) indicates that something about your approach is off-putting. So it's time to take a step back and evaluate your attitudes toward women, and the way you interact with them.

I am a guy a little older than you, and I lacked awareness about some pervasive sexist attitudes I had until I was in my late 20s, when I realized that a lot of my problems with past relationships and women in general stemmed from the fact that I was on some level (never consciously) objectifying them and not considering them as whole people. I never had the thought run through my brain that women are worse than men or that women are just sex objects. In fact, I considered myself quite progressive. But somewhere along the line I had internalized sexist ideas and they affected my life for the worse.

To start with, try to work on how you perceive men and women, and give that some thought. It is easy, when you first see a woman, to check her out and see if she is hot. To some degree, it's natural. However, it is also an additional step that I am guessing you don't take with the men in your life. That means that when you meet a man, your thought process goes something like: 'Here's a new guy -&gt; I wonder what he's like -&gt; He seems funny/smart/dumb/boring/whatever.'

However, when you meet a woman and go through the thought process of, 'Here's a woman -&gt; Is she hot...' it can more easily lead you to thinking about whether she would date you, whether she is single, and all kinds of stuff about how she relates to you as a potential mate rather than just who she is as a person. Even if you don't go down that route and go straight from 'Is she hot' to 'I wonder what she's like as a person' that is still a step between first impression and getting to know her that is standing in the way of connecting on a human level. So I really encourage you to try and make sure that you are engaging on a very human level before you ever even consider connecting with them as a woman or a potential partner, or somebody who is attractive or whatever.

That doesn't mean you can't check out women anymore, but it does mean that you shouldn't be checking out every woman you come across, and it shouldn't be the first reflex you have upon seeing somebody. If you don't smile at every hot guy you walk past, you probably shouldn't be smiling at every hot woman you walk past. Is it a big deal to smile at an attractive woman? No. But get used to noticing the little ways in which you treat men and women differently, and think about the way those differences might be affecting your relationships. 

Beyond that, try to look at your friend-making behaviour. Is the way you talk to women different from the way you talk to men? Do you seek their input with the same frequency as you do with men? Do you value their ideas to the same degree? Do you hold them to the same standards intellectually, emotionally, and physically?

Really what I am talking about here is a very thorough and years-long evaluation and adjustment process to try and get to a place where your engagement with women is welcomed, and I think a big part of it is getting to a point where you are perceiving everyone as a person first and foremost before you consider them as a man or woman or friend or potential partner or anything of the sort. So try to do some introspection about your own attitudes - and more importantly, what your behaviours say to the world about your attitudes. It's very easy to think you feel a certain way when the way you interact with the world tells a different story. I wasn't able to make real lasting change until I did some very objective analysis of my actions from a third party perspective.

I am sure you don't consider yourself a sexist or the type of guy who objectifies women. But it's very easy to internalize those sorts of ideas/attitudes and let it affect the way you interact to the world."
"I don’t think she understands that. She’s always been very poor and my fiancé and I make a good bit of money so she thinks it’s no big deal, that we have plenty. I don’t think she means to be selfish by thhibking that, she’s just never been good with money. "
"I think you and all the other commenters are right and that I am just not ready right now. I've discussed the anxieties with my husband but I need to tell him directly that I am not ready right now and can't say that I'll be ready by the end of the year either. Having known myself for my whole life, I find it difficult to believe that I would be completely changing my mind on this permanently. I likely just need more time to think about it and work through some of this stuff.

"&gt;I just feel like I’ve failed her so much by staying in this marriage.

So...do you want to do better by her, or stay in the marriage?  Those pretty much are your choices here."
"Yeah, not trying to spread blame because blame is a useless thing, but we don’t know if the bride-to-be’s opinions on being treated as a typical “middle child” are valid or not. She does sound a bit like a diva per her reaction to OP’s first pregnancy. 

That being said, weddings take a ton of planning and money ahead of time, so there’s probably no way it can or should be rescheduled around the baby’s delivery. I’m sure it’s frustrating for the middle sister that on her wedding day, there will still be a ton of attention elsewhere in the family. Not to say the pregnancy isn’t exciting or important, or that the OP should have planned the possibility of getting pregnant around the wedding date, but just having a little empathy for OP’s sister is not a crazy thing.

The language here is a bit dismissive of the middle sister’s previous concerns. 🤷🏻‍♀️ But every family has beef.


If I have advice, it would be for OP to wait until she’s further along in the pregnancy until announcing because of previously stated reasons. Then, advising the sister of the conflict in the due date and that bowing out as a bridesmaid could be an option. Delivery could be early or late. I’m sure that OP’s sister is going to blow her lid either way, but that’s just how it goes sometimes."

"&gt;It's also important to mention that my wife has a history of terrible financial decisions and keeping them from me. Credit cards and store accounts which she's maxed and I've had to cover.

&gt;Her father had a contact in the car industry and I was assured it was a great deal. Last weekend she took possession of the vehicle and drove it straight out of the dealer.

I don't mean to sound blaming...but is there a reason you trusted HER AND HER FATHER to do this? 

If she is simply the least financially responsible person on the planet, and her father has some weird desire to see his own daughter in massive debt...why didn't you join her? I know couples that are perfectly capable with their finances that still go car shopping together. It's a major purchase. And those are couples who *trust* each other. 

I am not trying to pile on here. I know you are beyond frustrated and betrayed. I am not saying this is your fault whatsoever. But I wouldn't trust your wife to take a card to buy bread and milk at the grocery, let alone a flipping car. 

Yes, see if you can get her out of the car. She needs financial counseling. I am so sorry, OP. "
I tend to agree mostly...  but we have twins arriving in 0-5 weeks. It’ll be the easiest way to get pictures and news out.
Is this friend male or female?
"That post was painfully to even finish reading. Your husband is not ok. He is abusing both you and your children mentally. That whole going running and then not letting the kids watch tv when they didn’t know- that’s some next level manipulation. You kids don’t deserve to be treated like that and neither do you. And to have that be a reaction to accidentally bumping into a video game console? His anger and control issues are out of hand. You need to go see a therapist to advise you on how to deal with him but honestly they should probably advise you on the best was to extricate yourself from this marriage before he turns violent. His behavior is not that of a rational, mentally stable human being. "
"I had an acquaintance who was dating a married man, and talked about how much this guy wanted her to meet his wife, wanted them to become friends, so that she could be around more often and his wife would trust her. I thought about that situation immediately after reading that. "
"If you don't know why, strangers on the internet aren't going to be able to tell you.

Conversations in bars get shut down for all kinds of reasons, most often? because that person didn't come to a bar to talk to you. Maybe get a couple of social hobbies that have a lot of women involved with them?"
"I've been there. That sucks. But even if you lose some portion of your social foundation, that's something you can rebuild.

The truth is, if your social foundation fundamentally rejects who you are, they were never a very good foundation to begin with. Life is so short, it's important to surround yourself with people who love and respect who you are. It's not worth groveling to people who fundamentally don't accept you."
"I think it's the fact that's it's the only thing that isn't a problem that makes it a problem. 

She has accepted that he is not functional. All his other behaviour is that box - the chores, the hygiene, the lack of effort. She can take it if that's just who he is - incapable. 

But then he can go out and do this normal enjoyable thing for himself? If he can do that why not brush his fucking teeth? It *is* a problem because he is prioritising something he wants over the basic functionality of their relationship. "

"I had a roommate like this, and the thing that got her to cut it out was to respond with ""huh, you should change that"" every time she made a comment. Only took a few weeks for her to realize what was up. 

Backstory: new roommate had moved into the house I lived in during a multi-room turnover period; a third roommate was leaving shortly thereafter and was the one who owned all the core furniture like table and couch, and in advance of her exit, I'd started prowling used ads for stuff, and paid a portion of the moving truck costs so I could pick up all my stuff right after the departing roommate moved hers. I knew I was going to stay in the place for a while and figured it'd be good to just lock it all down during moving season when used stuff was pretty cheap. So, first week new roommate lived in the house, she watched me furnish the place, sometimes even asking about an item and discovering I had it scheduled for pickup in the next week. 

However, she took this to mean that whatever she wanted, furniture-wise, I would provide, and continued asking about furniture things even after I made it clear that I had no more plans for furnishing as was done now that I'd covered the basics. It took me turning each comment back on her (""yeah. Where are you going to get that?"" ""Yeah, you should look online for one,"" etc.) for her to stop asking me to buy her stuff. It wasn't the nicest tactic, but after having a few clear conversations about how I wasn't her personal Ikea, it was what I had. Perhaps this is something that would get the same idea across to your BF."
"What you've described is not 50/50.  It's you picking up all the slack your bf leaves behind.  So if he wants to do his own thing, let him.  Cook only enough food for yourself, do only your own dishes and laundry.  Clean the bathroom to your needs, but don't pick up after him if you can help it.  If you cook enough meals for yourself and he has to cook on his own, he'll learn pretty damn quick that he's being an asshat."
"&gt;They are saying they have no choice and that they can't go.

That is not your problem. That's their problem. If they don't leave when you tell them to, cops."
"One thing to keep in mind, trip aside, is you can't control her heartbreak. Although it will definitely feel shitty, the kindest thing you could do is break up with her so that she can find someone with the same relationship goals in mind. The only thing you *can* control is breaking up with her in a kind, but firm way that communicates you still care about her as a person, but for the reasons you outline in your post, you just don't want to be in a serious relationship with her or anyone. Don't soften it by saying ""we'll see"" or ""let's stay friends"" and then immediately try forcing a friendship. Give her time and space afterwards. Let her know you hate hurting her like this and that you're gonna give her space, but you'll be there for her as a friend if she ever needs.

Now about this trip... it's perfectly valid to not want to be in a relationship anymore, but I will say that you need to break things off now so that she can try to cancel the trip or bring someone else. She might be investing so much and doing all this over-the-top stuff because she senses you're pulling away, so I really think it would be much kinder to tell her now before that trip.



"
"I'm not sure you are making too much out of it, if you are not typically a jealous type (if you are being honest in your post here, you are not). Spidey senses are often real, and if your gut is telling something is amiss, I am not sure you should ignore that gut feeling. 

Grabbing someone by the hips is not ""huggy."" It's a more intimate area or at least getting close to that. If there was nothing going on your wife should have been offended (in my opinion). 

Why is she hesitant to talk about it? I would bring it up again, stick to the facts and how that made you feel rather than any accusation. 

However you can drive yourself crazy looking for shadows behind the curtain, and I'd advise you not to let it get to that point. You either have to decide to trust your wife or go digging for dirt. I'd recommend the former, if something is really going on you'll find out soon enough. "
"I agree. I liked your and James maturity. When my parents divorced. They remained the very best of friends. Even now. 30 odd years later. They still ring each other for a chat. Both are remarried. Neither spouses see it as a threat. They all have such fun when together with me and my husband. 

I still remember to this very day. Being called an outright liar. I still remember professionals telling me this could never happen as people did t split amicably. I was horrified. My parents divorce has never ever effected me and I believe the reason to be because of how my parents dealt with it. Trust me. Even if no one else believes this. It’s truly beneficial to the child "
"He's not going to marry you. He is going to leave you holding the bag financially if anything happens (he could have at any point changed his beneficiaries or gotten another policy and has not) , so you have to decide if you want to stay knowing this or if you are ready to end it. That's the choice on the table. "
I wonder what your dad thinks about infertile women. Does he think they have no value because they can’t produce kids? 
"&gt;I try to clean the house and put things by the road to be picked up and she will go down to the road while I am at work and put them back into the house! I throw things away in the trash bins and she gets in there and pulls things back out

She needs to see a mental health specialist. 

It's not that she's not doing her share, it's that she is mentally ill. I say this with no stigma attached to the term."
That's a good point. I'm probably not helping her by texting for her. Thank you!
"Okay. “Their” family member is not also your husband’s family member.  Therefore the mooching BIL,needs to take his himself and his kids back to their home. The SIL can stay at the hospital with her relative.  They have money for booze and nicotine but not for food?  They have no intention of *ever* leaving voluntarily,imho."
"Dude sounds like a bum ..

I can't stand people who adopt animals, only to realize it's an actual responsibility, &amp; they're ready to give them back! I say you surrender the guy, and keep the dog! That's what I'd do .. 

Good luck! "
I'd go this route too. Anyone halfway decent is going to want to meet his good friends' partners.
"Not a red flag and also none of your business. 

If they had gone through with the pregnancy and he had a child floating around out there, then it would be a red flag and very much so your business."
"Just wanted to add:  I had a step mom that really resented me and did everything she could to exclude me from the family. My mom wasn't dead, my step mom had split up my parents marriage and she was super bitter and insecure and didn't like that my existence/presence was a connection to my mom that my dad would always have. Even though she was horrible to me my dad stayed with her and married her. It really damaged our relationship when he never stood up for me and stayed with someone who resented his child. I can't imagine how much worse that situation would have been if I didn't have my moms house to go to 50% of the time. 

It should also be said that not everyone is emotionally capable of being in a relationship with a widow/widower. I imagine that people (like myself) are too jealous to share a partner with a memory. She might just be young and need to mature a bit, or maybe she is starting to realize that being with a widower is different than being with a divorcee. You still love and care for your wife, and as totally normal as that is, I don't think she is comfortable with it. And it's ok that she's not comfortable with your history with your wife, but for your son's sake you need to decide what's more important: erasing his moms memory and staying with a person that wants you to shut out a part of your life that is part of your son's identity, or moving on and finding someone else who will help you keep your wife's memory alive *for your son*.

This is just some random internet strangers take on being a kid when your dads lady friend hates your mom and by extension you. Tldr it sucks."
Making reasonable requests is not nagging. Just to keep that distinction clear. 
"If you guys haven't talked about proposals or marriage yet, she'd be dumb IMO to expect any proposal. I think you're overthinking this OP."
"When I married my ex husband, we also had this weird issue of having problems where there were none before.  My ex was bad at communicating without getting angry, but I was finally able to tease out from him that he had vastly different expectations of a wife vs a girlfriend.  Furthermore, he assumed that ""everyone knew"" that this was how a ""wife behaved"".   

I wonder if your husband had this same set of un-wirtten rules in his head, OP.  It's OK for a girlfriend to have outside interests and goals and rely on friends and family for emotional support.  Now that you're married, I wonder if you husband expected things to change where you would ""settle down"" and ""settle in"", making your relationship and your home your number one priority.  He's frustrated that you haven't morphed into the wife he expected you to be.  And he didn't say anything about this to you before because in his head, ""everyone knows"" that this is ""what you do"" when you get married.  The comments about putting your job and your friends ahead of him, expecting that he would come with you on a business trip...that all speaks to his expectations of being the center of your world.  And when he says he doesn't need new friends or hobbies, he's telling you that he is offering you the same thing - why would he need anything else when he has you? 

Obviously, this isn't the life you want to lead, or one you thought you were signing up for.  The first thing to do is to confirm that this is what is going on in your husband's head...that he expected some kind of magic shift when you guys made the transition from boyfriend/girlfriend to husband/wife.  If that's what is going on, then you have to express that that is not the marriage you want - the two of you completely dependent on only each other.  And if you can't agree on how your marriage looks in a way that works for both of you, then you must insist on couples counseling.  Because you aren't going to continue living in a marriage where he has expectations you can't possibly meet.  "
"I legit LOL'd at ""rein in ya boiiiiiii"" - not what I was expecting and 1000% a reasonable response to his ish.  ...Though mayyybe a tiny bit wanting in professionalism, and empathy for Eileen who just found out via drunk FB message that her husband is a creep.  Basically 10/10 for substance, 12/10 for style, 5/10 for polish."
"Is there something in your relationship or life which could have killed your attraction for him? Something which has changed recently, either in his life or yours? Do you spend time together? Are you romantic with one another? Are you satisfied in bed?

"Girls usually get matching tattoos when they actually know each other, I think.  The wording in this post implies that the other girl doesn't know that Samantha got this tattoo..."

"At some point in that two hours you really needed to assert yourself. No, I'm not waiting, you keep leading me on about this, I'm coming to get the key."
"How did he give you the trip?  Was there a card or anything to unwrap or an email or anything at all?  Did he research any ideas?  Had you previously discussed travel?

Or did he just say ""hey, I'll get you a trip"" without doing any effort or planning at all?  Because I am guessing this was a no-though gift.  Did he get you any other gifts?  Were they paltry or small or last minute?

If he won't set a budget and won't set a destination, then this is his problem.  He is the one who does not know social rules."
"Yep. “Reddit” is right on this one. Dating 6 months, early 20s, long distance, and dead bedroom situation already?

"Yeah, I'm really sorry but this is on both of you. He is an irresponsible and lazy dude, and you shouldn't have had kids with him when you were still being his mommy. 

Downvote away but you should never make like altering decisions on the hope that someone will change. "
"yeah obviously you dont have to stay married to someone that doesnt change for the better.

but that date night stand up thing wasnt just to bring you out on a date, that was for you to be there as his emotional support, as he does something that terrifies him."
"And many dealers have a policy where if you return it within a set amount of days (2, 5, 7, 10--depends on the dealer and possibly on state law as well) then you get the full price back no questions asked.  Might lose the depreciation that occurred, but sounds like it would be well worth it in this scenario. "
"If you had any control over his reaction, he wouldn’t have reacted that way. You had no idea how this was going to affect him, and honestly, *it’s not your problem*, it’s his. He has some underlying emotional stuff going on about height, and he’s the only one who can do anything about it. All you can do is acknowledge it’s upsetting to him for some reason, and encourage him to figure out why and deal with it. All the reassurance in the world from you isn’t going to make any difference if he doesn’t work on whatever the problem is on his end."
That's what I picked up on. He'd better be getting himself to a hospital IMMEDIATELY if he's too weak to reply to a text.

"I just wanted to start by saying I'm so sorry this is happening to you.    I rarely comment on these, but reading this felt like reading something I would have wrote two years ago.   So, I hope my experience can help.

I started dating my (now ex) boyfriend at 16.   We were together for nearly 12 years before I discovered he'd been cheating on me with a woman who also was in a long term relationship.

Breaking up with him was an agonizing decision, and it's didn't come to me right away.    I did confront him, and he denied it.   I'd seen the messages though and I knew what I knew (even if I didn't want to believe it).  

Those weeks (and months) following out breakup were some of the hardest of my life.   I will say, my friends and family rallied around me in a way that I never would have expected.   Even so, it was hard learning to be 'alone'.   After we were apart for 3 months he began to reach out, finally admitting to the truth, begging for me back.   Despite everything I considered it.   What stopped me from taking him back was the distance and the perspective it gave me.   Yes, infidelity was the catalyst of our breakup...but it was just a symptom.  While in the relationship, I'd have said that it wasn't perfect, but it was love, and that I could never again find another person that 'understood' me like he did.

Outside of it, I had the clarity to see that he was not good for me, or good too me.   After taking time to heal, I found that I was a better partner to myself than he had ever been.   My confidence began to return, and my drive.   My life steadily got better, and I got happier.

Last year, I met someone new (our anniversary is this Saturday, actually).   Being with someone new, who treats me well, has really outlined for me just how misguided I was.   

My ex was a big part of my life.  He was more than a third of my life.  Leaving him was terrifying, but it was by far the best decision I could have made for both of us (although he may not see it the same).   We were together out of comfort, not because we were good for each other anymore, and I'm happier now than I've ever been.   Honestly, my only regret is not leaving sooner.


Maybe this is you, maybe it's not.    My advice is to not try to salvage it.   Leave, give yourself space and time to heal on your own.   Learn to be yourself without him.     No one can say what the future holds, but you deserve to take your best shot at being as happy as you can in this life. 

Anyways, best of luck, stay strong.  
"
"Thank you.

You're right. I should reach out to a therapist or at least some community to help me process it. My one concern is that most of my current connections (friends, acquaintances, even some of coworkers) were established through my family/parents. So I'm afraid that if I or my parents continue to go with this co contact, it will affect many parts of my life. "
She will certainly see his true colors come out if she proposes this. She should.

"&gt; As for 'making it up to her': good actions don't erase bad ones. 

This is a huge issue in my family where some people think that they can do shitty things just because of all the good they've done over the years. And then other family are apologists for them. Not how it works. I agree 100% with this one. Apologizing for your actions and then *backing it up* with noticeable changes is so important. Just keep in mind that it isn't easy to change a fundamental personality problem, and any apologies you make now are moot if you revert back to old habits.

Acknowledging something about yourself that you want to change is the first step, and in many ways the most difficult.

"&gt; Adults in adult relationships do not ""allow"" or ""not allow"" each other to do things, whether it's spending money or anything else. 

Last summer I took a trip to NYC to visit some friends (I used to live there). My husband mentioned it to a coworker. The coworker just a shocked look on his face and said ""I""d never ALLOW my wife to travel to a city like that by herself!""

After my husband stopped laughing he responded ""Yeah, there's no ""allowing"" in my marriage and I'm not particularly interested in controlling my wife.""

The guy muttered something about being pussy whipped and getting what my husband deserved as he wandered off.

"I am a sugar baby.

"Okay I'll start doing that it totally makes sense, Thanks :)"
"&gt;Yet he’s firm on not doing anything about his ADHD. 

And you need to be equally firm about wanting a functional partner.

It's time to have that conversation and tell him how you feel. Something tells me that, if he knows you're unwilling to have kids with him if his ADD/anxiety is completely out of control, and given that he knows you want to have kids with him in an ""I'm capable of flushing the damn toilet after I drop a deuce"" state, that might light a fire under his ass to do something about it. And maybe you're okay staying in the relationship indefinitely, caring for him as if he were your child, and you're okay never having children, but if you're not and you want to have a kid/kids, then you really need to figure out sooner rather than later if you need to find someone else who can be a functional partner to have the kid/kids you want."
"Yep. I think him doing stand-up is the only thing about him in this post that’s *not* actually an issue, and that OP is blowing out of proportion. It’s a bit odd that OP’s fixated on it, tbh.

For example, she’s annoyed that their first date in six years was going to watch him do stand-up. The problem there isn’t the stand-up at all - its that they’ve gone six years without a date, period!

Him doing stand-up (and being embarrassed/shy/nervous talking about it) is totally fine. All the other things are huge issues, and personally would’ve pushed me to leave long ago."
"&gt;. He said that's only because my family doesn't care enough. Very hurtful and not true. He apologized for leaving us but kept giving excuses for why he was justified.

It wasn't justified.  The fact that he participated in this is a big problem.   If he didn't want a *family* event, he should have not agreed to invite the entire family.   

Do not let this go.   He doesn't consider your family equal to his; that's not something you should accept. "
"Yeah, as someone from the Northeast, she is simply wrong that spending that much of inviting that many people is expected or agreed to when you sign up to be the most. In my experience, bridal showers are typically no more than 40 people and include the families/women from both families and a couple of the bride's closest friends. Family is typically part of planning and paying for this. I have even heard of people have a couples of bridal party-esq type of events--like work friends taking the bride out for lunch in addition to the family shower--but I have never heard of a 150 person shower. 

Bachelorette party is more typical, but still on the more ellaborate side. 

I kind of wonder if she is asking the bridal party to contribute so much because her family gave her a hard cap on what everything can cost all together, and she and her fiance cannot afford to contribute more, and she thinks this is a way of getting her dream wedding experience?

I think the polite thing to do would be to tell her asap that this is not what you are familiar with or expecting when you agreed to be moh, and that you love her but really can't afford all of this, especially in addition to flights, so if she wants someone who can manage all of that you are willing to step aside so that she can appointment someone else and you are so sorry because you would love to be able to give her the world it just isn't in the cards right now."
"Family therapy, solo therapy for each of the kids, and solo or couples therapy for you and your fiance. The family therapist will be able to offer more resources to help both you and your fiance, and the kids get through this as positively as possible. They might be able to point you and your fiance in the direction of some good parenting classes, too.

I want to add that you and your fiance are amazing people and I really hope your newfound family thrives as time goes on. "
"You don't seem to be financially compatible. If she can't adjust her approach to money and respect your (fully justified) anxiety at times like this, you may have some fundamental, irreconcilable differences here."
"Just FYI most larger or even average sized breasts sag. So your idea of 'nicely shaped' breasts may be due to airbrushed models, porn, or the appearance of breasts in a bra. Unfortunately gravity effects the shape of things so when you see near perfect round tits it's usually due to surgery or very small breasts. That said, I'd usually advise against lying but in this situation any sort of indication that you do not like her body is going to cause damage to her self esteem, so I'd avoid the subject as it seems you don't HATE them, or find them gross, it's just something you're not particularly excited about, which is fine. Not everyone finds every part of their partners bodies exciting or aesthetically pleasing. I'd continue to say ""I find you beautiful and I wouldn't change a thing."" If that's accurate. There's just no 'nice' way to say you're not a huge fan of someone's physical features, especially if that feature is hard to change without surgery, or unavoidable, and especially if they already have insecurities."
"Counselling isn't shameful or a punishment. It is a tool to help communication and understanding. It can be helpful for issues large or small. But Fwiw, saying he only cares about being together as a family with his family of origin and not hers represents a serious disagreement in perspectives that will continue to cause conflict. It has already caused hurt."
"My fiancé's family are actually Ethiopian immigrants, and we've been sitting down to dinner together just about every night since we moved in together. It's just part of the culture and our family structure, so I'm sure the family dinners will be high in our priorities!   
We're also very active, outdoorsy people, so we're hoping family hikes or something of that vein will be of interest to the girls. The 9 y.o. perked up a little at our mention of going to our climbing gym after our meeting with their caseworker, and I'm holding onto the hope that that will be a good bonding activity for her."

"I've seen homeschooling done really really well and very very poorly.

My neighbours currently homeschool their 2 kids (14 and 12 years old). They follow a proper curriculum, and are heavily involved in activities (soccer, hockey, cheerleading, speech arts, a youth book club, youth cooking classes and an after school science program). They take the provincial wide testing as required by grade level. They definitely get the structure and appropriate peer interaction through home school groups and activities. 

And then there's a friend's cousin who does ""unschooling"" yeah those kids are not going to be qualified to walk dogs, let alone graduate. Mom's lazy and an idiot. 

When it's done well it's awesome, sadly most folks suck at it.

"I think it's because people fall into the trap of thinking they can only develop feelings for one person at a time. Or more specifically, something is wrong when they develop feelings for someone else during an otherwise healthy relationship.

I think nothing can be wrong and your original relationship can be going great and you can still develop feelings for another.

I think the truth is love is really about emotional fulfillment. And that you can be fulfilled in many different ways. In turn that means you can develop romantic emotional attachment to many different people at once.

But like you say, emotional maturity is recognizing that even though one is capable of romantic desires for more than one person at a time isn't a good idea in the bounds of a mutually agreed monogamous relationship.

I think if we can accept that concept, it makes it easier to be accountable to yourself and not just go with tired cliches."

You are a broke, unemployed graduate student, and no amount of expectation on her part, or desperation on yours, is going to change that, so you need to be honest with your friend. Make it clear to her that you cannot afford to make any significant financial contribution to this wedding and you WILL NOT put yourself in debt to be able to do so. 

If she's as good a friend as you say, then she will understand; your friendship won't change and you will stand beside her at her wedding because you're best friends, not because you were able to financially contribute to it. If not, then I'm really sorry but you can do better than someone who puts a price tag on your friendship."

"Your father abused your mother and your mother was a victim. You don't tolerate abuse, no matter what they taught you. That's not acceptable in the real world. 

Your bf should be in prison. And probably so should your father. We have laws against these things for a reason, and that reason is your protection.

I strongly urge you to get into therapy. If you've normalized this type of abuse, you will find yourself in abusive relationships over and over again. You need to figure out what is normal and break the cycle of abuse."
"Not a dumb question at all! 

I will say, I believe your sister has to be there. It'll be better for her to be there too, because the police do not give you a long amount of time to sort through and decide what you do and don't want. It's an escort for them, and anything longer than 30 mins is a shopping trip and they will probably yell at you to wrap it up. You will not have enough time to get both of your possessions

This is not consistent with her behavior. You are holding onto an idealized version of her. Let it go.

What if someone else treated you the way she did? "
"What's up with most of the comments here telling OP that it's none of his business?

1) She deliberately lied about the 2nd guy, and
2) The 2 guys she slept with are still part of her core group of friends. TBH, most people would be uncomfortable if their partners are still regularly hanging out with their exes (FWBs or not).

OP, if you're fine with these two things then sure; otherwise, you need to seriously evaluate your relationship."
"Your husband likes to verbally abuse you.  He doesn't like it when you stand up for yourself, so when you do, he doubles down on the abuse.  This isn't about you, it's about him, and the fact that you're his favorite punching bag.

Is this really how you want to spend your life?  He's not going to change.  If he thinks that he might lose his favorite punching bag he might lie for a bit and pretend that he'll change, but this right here - this is who he is.  He'll be the same in 5 years, and in ten.  The only possible change is that he'll escalate and get worse, once he's more confident that you'll accept the abuse."
"It seems like you're not taking her concerns very seriously, based on the tone of this post, and you saying she must be ""crazy for wanting to give this all up."" What is all of this? 90% of it is benefits for you alone. Your wife just prioritizes friends over living on the beach, which is absolutely normal and fair. Why are you acting like she's insane for that preference? You may be living in a luxury apartment, but it's very understandable if that doesn't mean much to her if the rest of her life in Hawaii is terrible. In a marriage, you can't just think of what's best for you and hope your wife shuts up and deals with it. You're a team now—her problems are your problems, especially as she is a new mother and needs your support more than ever. You need to actively work with her to help her find new friends and treat her concerns as if they have just as much value as your excitement, because they do."

"&gt; She says that she has trust issues because 1)her ex cheated on her and lied a lot 

Little anecdote for you:

My ex husband and I were together for 8 years. When we met I was 22 and he was 34. He was a habitual liar - not just through omission, but blatant, cruel lies. He stole money, cheated on me, damaged my relationship with his own mother through said lies and manipulation (he played us against each other and she didn't end up coming to our wedding, nor did any of his family/friends because of the lies they believed about me), ruined my credit to the point of near-bankruptcy, was unemployed for the entirety of our three-year marriage and then he cleaned out my bank account, left the country and left me with $25k in mutual debt by the age of 30. I even found out later that his ""amicable"" split with his ex/baby mama wasn't amicable at all and he actually left her, skipped town and got with me all while claiming they were a couple and he'd be moving her and their kid to be with him ""any day now"". I was never allowed to speak to/meet the ex OR his son. In 8 years. I divorced him on my own when I was 31 by finding the required forms online and hauling my ass to the courthouse to pay the fees more than once. I packed up, moved to the city with my dog and two cats, started a new job and paid off all of my debt within 2 years.

My current SO, whom I met through work around 4 months following my split (became a couple dating 10 months later) is WONDERFUL. He's trustworthy, kind, dependable, reliable, honest and loving. NEVER - NOT ONCE - despite what what I've been though, have I ever accused him of lying, cheating or betraying me. I TRUST HIM because he's 1) NOT MY EX, and 2) never given me a reason not to. I have NEVER snooped in his phone even though I have the password. Ever. His private conversations with friends and family are absolutely none of my business. I have NEVER had a problem with him spending time with his guy friends, which he does weekly at minimum. 

I think you can agree that my ex was a lying piece of shit. Instead of dwelling on that and letting it sabotage my current (wonderful) relationship I dealt with my insecurities and swore that I would not my ex's toxicity ruin my life for one more day. I gave him my 20's but I'd be damned if he'd get my 30's too. So I moved on and put it behind me. Clearly your girlfriend cannot (and will not) do the same.

You know what you have to do, OP.

&amp;#x200B;"
"You’re being too nice/very passive. She probably doesn’t even know you’re annoyed. Try claiming a guy first. If she then starts saying that she likes him too, say breezily “that’s too bad! But last time you got dibs on the guy we both liked, so this time I’ll take him.” (A more than reasonable outcome.) See how she reacts.

Also, if you don’t enjoy the texting on her behalf, you’re on the right track: just don’t do it!"
Why are you doing all this shit for someone who doesn't care about you? Why are you paying $100 a week to be a rich person's chauffer? None of this makes sense.
"He wanted to move in with her old roommate’s stuff, clearly "
"If you aren’t going to be given a stake in the business, you need to quit and find a new job, especially if he expects you to waive alimony.  

If it’s his business alone, it’s his problem to find someone else to do everything you’ve done for him.  If you’re just an employee, you need to stop doing anything extra because it’s just a regular job for you, by his choice.  

Prenups have to be fair.  What he’s suggesting isn’t.

This is a hill worth dying on."
"Yeah, this relationship is over. Take care of yourself OP, look for resources (pro-choice) in your area. "
"WTF who ruins a special moment like that in such a spiteful way?!? Ask your girlfriend for the ring back and explain how you feel. Tell her you want to make it special. She probably feels the same way... and enraged on your behalf. 
A sneaky alternative is to set up a romantic evening at home, and secretly swipe the ring back that evening. During dinner or whatever, tell her she's an amazing woman that you can't wait to make a lifetime of memories with, good or bad. But this one memory, you want to be good. Break out the ring, and  pop the question. Pay homage to the racist by laughing at his shallow attempt to dull your radiant happiness. "
That’s not reassuring either. Generally people back off when they approach an ex who makes it clear they’re unwelcome. The fact that he pressed his attention on her when she was telling him in no uncertain terms to leave her alone would give me a VERY bad gut feeling. 
"You don't have to catch it on your own. You have to make the unspoken norms, outspoken and clear, because otherwise you never get them. I have had to tell my Dutch husband how to deal with my Chinese family, to make sure there isn't a huge upset if they don't understand each other. So I had to explain in detail, what certain things meant. Expecting him to just 'read the room' or 'know these things' or 'follow the norms' isn't going to work at all. When we had dinner with our friends, the wife's family who are also Chinese were visiting, and we had a cultural discussion at the table, because my husband missed a cultural cue and it was done with grace and love. Her husband joked about how he didn't get that one, but now he does, so he told my husband 'just follow my example tonight'.     

You are not that rude foreigner. You are that interesting woman from another culture. Anybody who has any cultural sensitivity will know that we are world citizens and we need to make allowances to each other.    "
"&gt;However, her ultimatum is if my fiance wants his father as his best man, she will have to be present despite how we feel...or his father will not come.

So your fiance's dad isn't invited then. That's fine. If his father wants to choose an abusive woman over his own son, then let him live with that decision and have a great day without them."
Why on earth are you financially supporting a partner of less than 7 months??
"I wouldn't send that letter. Any personal contact is a step backwards for both of them. But I would consider having an attorney send a cease and desist- shows that you cannot be swayed, you mean business, and it might scare her off."
I have ADHD and this is just laziness on his part. Can't even fucking flush the toilet and asks you to check behind him? WTF? Why would you marry this dumpster fire of an irresponsible idiot? 
"I think if she already HAD the stuff, and brought it with her, it would just be greedy, not emotional labour.





The planning and picking thing, to me, sounds like real labour (more of a mental load than emotional), and definitely is sexist."
"Go ahead and read them but understand if it’s what you think you’ll probably divorce her. As long as you’re good with that go ahead. Me personally I would want to know. If she was honest with you no harm. If she wasn’t well that’s obviously a different story. Good luck.
"
"It is good you recognize that this isn't your fault - because it isn't. She has serious trust issues. This probably will happen again if the three of you hang out again unless she deals with those trust issues. 

Forbidding her bf to talk to other women at work and not go to work outings is unreasonable. She needs to talk this through with a professional. 

You have every right to be upset. You have every right to bring it up in conversation with her. You have every right to tell her to stay away until she fixes her head and to never pull that bullshit with you again. "
"Welp, I guess that decides it. How many cows did you offer him? Perhaps if you throw in a good parcel of land with a few hearty serfs he'll change his mind."
"There is nothing wrong with being monogamous. Many people want to share their life with one person. Many species of animals mate for life. People are unique and have different wants and needs for themselves, and that’s okay. 

I once tried a poly relationship and found it’s not for me. I am not a bad person. 

That whole saying about no one can fulfill someone’s needs 100% is true, to an extent. But, that’s why we have friends and family outside of relationships. We are multidimensional beings who thrive in a multitude of different interactions with various people, coworkers, friends, and their community as a whole. So I don’t buy that I’d have to open up my relationship. My partner should have friends and hobbies outside of me; that’s normal and healthy. 

Just my two cents. "
Look at what you're writing. You're scared of your own husband in your own house because he might get mad and you don't want to set him off because you're not sure how he'll react. Does that sound okay to you? Do you have any friends or family to stay with tonight?

"Picky and lazy, not a good combo"

That's what a normal adult would do, but he chose to flip it around and make it a huge deal. This guy sounds exhausting to be around."
Yes he doesn’t know compromise. He wants to be the man that takes care of me but only by his standards 
"Ultimately if he doesn't want to put in the effort, anything you do towards the goal is a waste of time.

You're worth more than that and he can also go and work on these things while you enjoy yourself without being emotionally drained by the fact that he isn't invested in this relationship. That may change in the future but don't waste your time waiting to find out. "

A twitchy, nervous, aggressive vibe

Condescension, patronizing remarks, lecturing, heckling, demanding answers, ""sea-lioning"" , ""Devil's Advocate"" type arguments, straw men, etc. 

A lack of awareness of social conventions in a negative way, including ""one love!"" hippie types that are essentially asking for or demanding a higher level of emotional or physical intimacy than I would like to give

"Trying to figure out why she would get out of the car and shake OP's hand, maybe BF said OP was his sister? That part is weird. "
"I think it’s weird how many people on here DON’T think this is weird. Yes you have to trust your significant other but if you voice a concern about them going out with some random stranger of the opposite sex for dinner and they ignore you, that’s literally making some random stranger a higher priority over you and your concerns. 

I like discussing religion and deep topics with new people too and I understand getting into those discussions while out and tipsy. But rarely would I wake up the next day and want to see those people again (one on one, no less) because the discussion is just soooo good. There are plenty of interesting people out there. If I was really only interested in friendship but wanted to respect my relationship I’d wait until you got back into town and invite the girls out with our friend group.

"Jesus man, tell her to get the fuck over it. 

Seriously.  A business made a simple mistake,  which they tried to fix as best as they could and she wants to ruin all your family events over that for perpetuity?

Oof. I missed that. An age gap like that is no big deal between adults. But when it begins between an adult and a teenager? 😶 20 year old men have NO BUSINESS getting romantic with 16 year old girls. That’s distressing.

I won't be getting in touch with lawyers. I am busy looking for a marriage counselor and a financial advisor. We will be returning the vehicle. I'm pretty sure we'll take a hit on the value of the vehicle, but I'll figure that out in time. Wish us luck. "
Most prisons won't allow you to send that stuff. You have to buy it from the commissary at a huge markup. There's a whole world of predatory industries that exist only to suck inmates dry.
Have you told her that begging publicly for her to marry you would make you feel humiliated? 
"Nopenopenopenopenope.

I have a pretty significant amount of debt from school and I plan to pay it off on my own as soon as possible. If I were married all of my paychecks would be: my half of the bills paid, and the rest toward my debt. 

That is how he should approach this.

Now if there was a significant difference in income between you two maybe it would be different (but that doesn't seem to be the case), and I could fairly see you supporting the two of you while he paid it off, with you being fully in charge of finances and bills. Even then, it should be HIM putting his own money toward the debt. 

"
This screams what I experienced with my ex.  I remember him wanting me to cook (which is not my strong suit).  I am a picky ass eater and only know how to cook spaghetti. I remember me suggesting to him that we go through a cookbook together and choose some recipes for me to try out. That was out of the question.  He didn’t understand why I couldn’t just go through cookbooks like his mom and choose something on my own.
"Two things you can do right now:

* Reduce the amount of time you spend with them.  Do not go on any more vacations.  If they ask you why tell them it's not pleasant to be with people who ignore you.
* When someone interrupts you to start a new discussion, get up and leave the table, the room, wherever.   Do not sit there and ignore their behavior.

Then seek some counseling to help you accept that you're essentially a fifth wheel in your family and they will never value you as much as the rest of your family."
"I currently live in Hawaii. It’s easy for people who don’t live in Hawaii to say that they would be jealous to live here, and how ridiculous it is that your wife isn’t loving it, but it can be pretty isolating. Not everyone likes the beach. 
It’s very common to hear how isolating this place can be, particularly for SAHM’s. Jobs are great for making friends, but childcare is incredibly expensive. Full time daycare can cost $10,000/year at a minimum.
Encourage her to make friends, but not just play dates with the baby. Make sure you can send her out with her new friends, without the baby. 
Keep in mind that Hawaii isn’t for everyone. Just because you love it, doesn’t mean she’s going to. We love it here and plan to live her for 7 years total, but I have plenty of friends who can’t wait to get off this rock. I don’t blame them, and I recognize that this place isn’t for everyone."
"I’m leaning more to projection:

&gt; - he goes much more often than me

when *he* goes to the club, he hits on other women, therefore in his mind that’s what everyone else is doing too. Hey OP how often does he get home in the wee hours after a night out."
"If you are at the point you are falling asleep at the wheel, you are doing too much and he needs to step up and help spread some of the responsibilities instead of getting mad and berating you. 

You told him you were exhausted and he still spent 35+ minutes at his friend’s while you were stuck waiting with an unhappy child. You asked to go home and presumably nap and just get him later, and he ignored your needs.

How much inequality is there in your relationship? Do you split bills, chores, chauffeuring, and child-tearing equally? Or are you taking on an unfair burden, like it sounds? 

It sure seems like you are, and that means he is not blameless, either. You are literally not physically capable of maintaining at this point. He’s supposed to be your partner, which means you both carry the burden so one of you doesn’t end up being killed by the weight of it, like you very nearly did. "
"It definitely doesn't sound like you are ready for kids yet. All of the things you've listed are very real possibilities, but it doesn't sound like the prospect of the child overcomes these fear for you at the moment. "

"&gt; someone who doesn't bother to feed and hydrate themselves like an adult.

Sounds like he's expecting it to be OP's job to do that for him. "
"This is so bizarre. He leaves you with his family to go hang out with his friends? What? I just visited my boyfriend's hometown with him and he brought me with him to meet all of his friends and hang out as a group as he wanted me to get to know them and be included. If he had left me behind with his family for hours to go do activities without me, we would not be in a relationship. "
"Don't waste your time with people who try to make you feel bad for how you operate in your day to day life. This includes significant others.

You aren't doing anything wrong or malicious. She seems to think she can just be passive aggressive and/or berate you into behaving how she wants you to. If this has been the last 6 years, buckle up, it'll just get worse if you commit to a lifetime together.
"
"&gt;how it's not a place he'd be proud to have people over.

But he was ok having his girl over in that mess he called his previous home... 

But that's none of my business *sips tea*"
"So much this. The only ""gift"" he gave was to himself, the gift of not having to put any thought or effort into a present for someone he claims to love. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything after that bit is bad - his communication is awful, he's manipulative and rude, etc. But the big thing that stuck out to me was that very first thing. Him throwing a bunch of money at a ""gift"" (while refusing to say how much money), while refusing to actually do any of the real or emotional labor. I wouldn't want that in my life. "
"&gt; But that panic turned to angry really quickly.

Do you blame her? I mean the fucking *nerve* of this guy. Maybe he's better now, maybe he's not going to be abusive to you, but it sure as fuck sounds like much of her story is true. I'd be furious if my former abuser approached me in public, all cheery la-de-dah as if he didn't put me through hell.

I think you should be very concerned right now. There's a lot of flags in your description of him even if we take her completely out of the picture, especially the financial stuff.

And there's one solid fact in his story. He got together with a teenager when he was *twenty-six*. "
"Add in that he probably forgot or waited until the last minute to get OP a Christmas gift so he pulled ""I'll take you on a vacation!"" out of his ass without thinking about much of a financial commitment that is. "
"If you actually think she intended it as a joke I would tell her that it’s not funny and makes you uncomfortable because it feels to you like she actually means it on some level and that she needs to stop making these remarks, that it’s something that *you* are not willing to compromise on."
"Are you ""not ready"" or do you not want to be married? It's completely fine to not want to get married, but not to string your boyfriend along saying ""not yet,"" knowing that he wants it. Do you want kids?


People say marriage changes things/the next step/whatever, but when I got married, it changed nothing. We lived together, we were comfortable together, and we plan on being together for the foreseeable future. But it wasn't a major change, because we were already a secure couple. It was a piece of paper. But a piece of paper that makes a lot of legal things...hospital visitation, inheritance, power of attorney, taxes, etc, a lot easier. 


I have some years on you, have been a teacher for 10 years, and still, every time I say ""husband,"" I definitely think ""That's weird, that's a grown up person word"". 


But you need to figure out why you keep wanting to put it off. And you need to think about what you actually want. But you can't keep telling your boyfriend ""soon"" for the next 20 years. Why don't you want that piece of paper, if you plan on being together?


Maybe therapy to help deal with your past and realize that your relationship isn't your parents' relationship. 


But you really need to decide if you want kids. He does."
"Well for one thing, start to use disposable diapers for now. I can't imagine cloth diapers with triplets.

"Yeah I think this is right. Our relationship needs love. We are overly focused on career and kids to the detriment of our closeness. In terms of happiness I feel we both are pretty happy. I, in fact, cannot recall a time when I was happier. My kids make me melt daily, my work is fascinating, and my hobbies are all-engrossing. But yeah if I really lost her I would be tossed into a spiky pit of doom for who knows how long - maybe never to return."
"Agreed, why can't he make his own food if he's being so picky? He's an adult, right? Also, what gives him the right to abuse his wife, or anybody at all if he doesn't get his way? He isn't a toddler, and OP isn't his mom. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, OP. I hope y'all figure this out. "
"I loved in Hawaii, also with a great salary and free housing, had lots of friends, and loved all of the outdoor activities available there.

However, I would have hated to love there permanently, especially with an infant. It's SO FAR from everything, there are no seasons, you can go on road trips, the community is tiny (depending ding on what island you're on, but you get to know all the locals eventually), and there's no family around to help with the baby.

Neither of you is right or wrong, but she tried it for two years, staying home with an infant while you're presumably out working/being social, and it's not for her. You two need to talk, but you're never going to get anywhere unless you quit acting like her opinion is crazy and invalid. There are plenty of reasons to not want to live in Hawaii and you need to acknowledge that."
He might have blocked you on his wife's phone before she even saw your message.

That is how abusers lure you in. Most abusers start off this way.

You said no upfront. You also TOLD him at the end how hurt you were and he informed you that you were wrong and that he had not hurt you. He is abusing you and rewriting what happened.

You are in HUGE danger. He could kill you. You need to leave now. This is not a joke."
"I have a lot of the same concerns as you and I ultimately decided I will not be having children, at least not biologically.  Luckily my husband is and has always been on the same page.  You need to be straightforward with your husband, if he can't live with you possibly changing your mind or at least needing more time, you will have bigger issues to discuss."
He’s not thinking of building a life with you. He doesn’t want to take you into account. 
Your boyfriend has a new girlfriend.   Why are you still calling him your boyfriend?
"Sounds like he waited until you were married and pregnant before revealing his ugly side. 

Please, please tell your parents what’s going on, and move back with them if you can while you figure this out. Your house is not a safe one right now, and you’re pregnant and vulnerable. Reach out to friends and family for support. And call an attorney. Things are going to get complicated with an unborn baby in the mix, and the sooner you know what you’re up against legally, the better prepared you’ll be when the baby comes. 

I’m so sorry, OP. Please take care of yourself. This is a tough one. "
Get a divorce. This isn't about hunger pangs. He's abusive.
What is the division of other household chores between the two of you?  
"&gt; we just wait our turn at the stove and to wash our dishes SEPARATELY??

Yep.  He doesn't want a GF, he wants a roommate.  You have to decide if you are happy with that arrangement or not."
"&gt; I heated this up for myself, if you'd like some - make some yourself.

You know it's time to leave when you get petty over half a frozen pizza

I can feel your anger and resentment coming through the screen. Yeah, I don't think there's any point in staying in this relationship for you. Even if she does miraculously change due to one therapy session, it will take a decade for you to get over all this stuff and start to like her again. tbh I don't understand why you didn't end it years ago. This amount of built up resentment is usually seen in couples who have been together for 30 years, raised 5 children, and can't get divorced because they're Catholic and it wasn't done in the 50s."
"Your co-workers are very conservative, small-minded people who are victim-blaming and generally being quite rude to you. It is absolutely not your fault for being friendly to the cleaning guy and laughing at what you thought was a joke. That does not invite unwanted touching or him screaming at your coworker. He is the one who did something wrong. Please get a new job with a healthy environment "
"Why the hell are you marrying this guy when you're already in a dead bedroom and it's causing a ton of issues?  Do you think it will get better?  Do you think your resentment will not fester?  I got news for ya...  I can feel your resentment come through in text, I'm sure it's worse IRL."
"&gt;I reminded him that his family spends an order of magnitude more time with our son. He said that's only because my family doesn't care enough. Very hurtful and not true.

Here's your problem. 

Forget about the fact he took off before you did the cake and presents; find out why he has such a low opinion of your family and go from there."
Yep. The car goes back. Full stop.
"Maybe ask her to wear it for you first, and you two can get sexy together, so now the dress has a different association for you two?"
"You need to leave. You do realize that if someone gets wind of this, CPS will be all over you and won't hesitate to take your baby from you. This is serious OP. He keeps denying it. He doesn't want to deal with the problem. It's obvious. You said you burned a lot of bridges...that's not a good sign at all. I urge you to reach out to your family and explain the situation. This is not a good environment to be in especially with a baby on the way. "
"&gt; The girl dropped him off and came to the door to shake my hand, which I found odd.

I don't think it's odd, it was polite of his new girlfriend to introduce herself."
"Surely there's a solution for this that won't make the wife uncomfortable but that will remove doubt. What if she filmed a general video of herself saying, ""Hi, I'm [guy's wife]! We have an open relationship and he is allowed to have outside relationships as long as he doesn't [off-limits things here]. I really don't like to know details, so I'd prefer not to have contact with his secondary partners. Thanks!"""
"Haaard pass. 

He “can’t exclude” random strangers? Then he *can’t host these games in your shared living space*."
"I’m terrible with money and had debt that I hid because I felt shame and guilt about not being able to get my shit together, but one day I had to suck it up, sit my then-fiancé now-husband down and confess it all. I was sick about it and had no idea if he would stick with me or not, but he handled it maturely and we came up with a plan to fix it. I vowed then to never hide debt from him again and agreed to discuss any big purchases with him. It’s been 15 years or so and, although my instinct to spend sometimes sneaks up on me, it takes a back seat to my respect for him and our marriage. We have been debt free for a long time now and have good savings, retirement plans, a college fund for our kid, etc.  Although we are in a much better financial situation now, we still discuss purchases over $250 or so, even though our budget could easily absorb that. We have a partnership and approach finances with that in mind. 

My point is, people can change, but only if they really want to. It’s up to OP’s wife now. "
Under no circumstances should you allow this woman at your wedding. You witnessed her violence. This is *your* decision just as much as it is his. 
"Jesus, 5'11 isn't even short. Dudd needs help. And at 6'4"" I regularly put 6'3"" on my profile as so many women put that as their tallest preferences "
"Kids' names should be decided with two yesses and vetoed with one no. This is a tenet over at /r/namenerds. While he has his hopes and dreams for your child so do you. 

Your husband sounds like he has a lot of himself tied up in this potential child. But placing too many expectations on a child in utero is a dangerous game. Your child could grow to dislike the name, or choose to go by an unrelated nickname, or even change their name in the future. Your child might not be anything like grandpa and may even dislike the association. Your child could turn out to be trans. 

I think the name battle is a proxy for other problems. 

1) Your husband is unwilling to compromise when it comes to his deepest desires and is willing to disregard your own dreams in favor of his.

2) Your husband seems to view a potential child as an extension of himself over which he has full control. Which will never happen because your child will, and should, grow into their own independent autonomous person

Put the name debate in hold because I believe these other issues need to be hashed out before he'll be ready to have children with you."
"Yes, this guy is a predator."
"""Hey, I am not going to take care of your dog for you."" Keep this boundary. Love is not an excuse for her to take advantage of you."
Told him this morning he needs to go to therapy.  No more excuses. 
"&gt;Or did he just say ""hey, I'll get you a trip"" without doing any effort or planning at all?  Because I am guessing this was a no-thought gift.

Yup I agree with this all the way.  Seems to me like he forgot about getting a gift and just decided he'd say he'd take her on a trip as a gift and was hoping it would never happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Also from the comments I see both OP and BF are 25 years old and he makes $115k a year and she makes $80k a year.  With that income then there is no reason a $3,000 vacation should break the bank.  "
"“It’s fine if he blows his income” 
Wtf no, if he is blowing his pay on crazy shit I wouldn’t pay a single cent towards his vehicle or insurance. "
"&gt; panic turned to angry really quickly.

You realize that she had a *small child a*nd her abuser was sauntering up and acting like they were old friends?

Yeah...when I'm backed in a corner my fear will turn to anger as a self defense mechanism too!"
"Play it casually stupid and just tell him like you're baffled by what happened. 'It's really weird, everything was all together in a bag and now all that's there is the cake pan. It's such a bummer because I really loved that gift and couldn't wait to use it.' He'll know his wife took it, and he'll know you know, but you've not directly accused anyone or started a big fight.

That said, he'll probably tell his wife and she will probably start a fight because guilty people can't help but feel comments are directed at them, even if they really aren't, and then get defensive."
"Yeah this. Either all finances are shared and you make joint decisions and compromises. (Or you have enough money that you don't actually need to have a conversation about one partner spending a hundred bucks)
OR: you each have your own money and as long as bills are being paid and noone is involving their money in crimes or what have you, then the other partner's fun money is none of your business. There is no option that allows for one partner considering his money to be his money and your money to be shared money. I have an idea that he thinks this because you pay such a big share of expenses. So he thinks your money is supposed to be for serious things only..."
"If you posted this in BDSM they would be yelling red flag! red flag! What you are describing is grooming and it is the act of a predator not a partner. This violates all the rules of consent. Especially because you did not agree to explore explicitly (even if it was just for now). 









Part of grooming is testing your boundaries. Will she accept my apology? Did she let me hit her? Did I get her to apologize to me? Then there will be a harder test and more pushing. Did she give up saying no? Is she too ashamed to tell her friends? Did she stay? This is why we tell you to run away now as fast as you can. 









This nudging and negging and pushing will drop you into a dark deep hole and it's hell to crawl out. And if you don't run now you will be on your knees crawling in no time. Really, it happens to the strong and smart and weak and stupid equally and you are not immune. The best thing you could do this minute is shut him down and turn on the bright light of truth. Tell your two best friends EVERYTHING that happened and ask for their help. Shut him down on all social media and phone contact. Lock down to friends only filters. Spend lots of time with your friends until you feel better. Box up anything of his and have a mutual friend take it to him. Do NOT answer your door to him. In three weeks you will suddenly feel normal again and wonder what you were even thinking as you go on to live a great life. 









What he has done/is still doing is not ok. Run. Please run. "
"honestly, what is it with 40 something man babies on this sub? This guy makes fun of you for longing for a child, how fucking heartless is that? This guy is meant to be your partner in life and he treats you like this? I would strongly recommend leaving this guy, you're only 30 you are definitely still capable of meeting someone great and having the family you desire"
"It’s true, being super insecure in your masculinity is not very masculine ironically "
You should have told him when it happened to prevent this situation. There’s nothing you can do now but be honest. 
"I'm very sorry about this. Please get in touch with friends and family, find a place to stay. You'll be fine again soon enough, take care man."
"My life would look like me standing up 100% for what I need, and if he refuses to participate in making this union work, I need out.  For my own sanity.  "
"He's overreacting to the point of being a rude asshole, I'd be mad at him."
When you look at your 3rd point in context of OPs boyfriend going clubbing a lot.. Makes you wonder..
"If you guys have been working well together for 16 years bringing legal stuff into it could disrupt everything you guys have accomplished. Does you girlfriend not understand how rare it is for parents who are not together to function in a responsible and grown up coparent relationship? You guys are unicorns!

Your successful parenting relationship needs to be your first priority. Joining finances with a girlfriend isn’t something you should be doing right now. Coming up with a plan for how things will be handled once you are actually married is fine. But changing things now to appease a girlfriend is a terrible idea.  "
"After having worked for Toyota for 5 years, I can tell you that you can't necessarily ""return"" a car, unless there is a clause in the contract that allows for that. 

After you take delivery, the only way to ""return"" the car, would be to trade it back in and get as much of the original value back as possible. Chances are good that they would be able to recoup most of the car's value, but they will also potentially be out anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand, depending on the value of the loan. 

At the end of the day, OP really needs to go to a financial planner and get some marriage counseling with his wife. She has a spending problem. "
"For me that the most unnerving part - clearly she doesn’t want him there, clearly he is bothering her - walk away! 

He doesn’t walk away, but stands around for *minutes* until she has to leave? 

That’s a little crazy. "
"Damn, talk about a bad decision. That tattoo artist should be ashamed. It would be one thing if it was a small tattoo on his arm or something that could be removed/covered fairly easily. But a torso-sized tattoo of her face after dating for 4 months is just awful."
"I mean....this is a date. 

You obviously have some interest in Broadway. 

Being a couple is sharing new experiences. 

I’d be miffed. For sure. They aren’t just tickets to a show or just tickets to dinner it’s ...a date night. 

And while there’s no way for you to find out tactfully, I am willing to bet $1000 that his parents would be surprised that you are, his partner of 2 years, is not attending the date night they paid for lol. "
"(a) should have asked (and still can) GF what she thinks about you asking her parents

(b) Fuck it, ask her anyway."
"&gt;I assumed that he had been teasing me for getting upset about not getting pregnant because he’s secretly upset too and just doesn’t know how to express it. 

Do you often find yourself attributing emotions to him that he doesn't actually express, in an attempt to humanize or soften his words and actions?  "
"Your children are going to be more traumatized by learning that ""love"" is being miserable forever. "
"You've adapted to your situation - call it whatever you like. But here's the thing, if you work in an industry where there's a lot of crazy shit going on, you have to learn to be selective in your story telling because ""civilians"" just don't get it. 

Any police officer, firefighter, EMT, doctor, nurse, etc can tell stories from their work that will make your hair curl - and people love to hear them...except when it makes them uncomfortable. So be more selective about what you say...it's unfortunate that your BF jumped to the worst conclusion, but that's on him. It sounds like your company is not a good match for you values-wise, so it's a good thing you're looking elsewhere. "
My first thought also. If he isn't always like this then it is because he is cycling. 
"Agreed, I understand it would be hard to be with someone who was widowed, they didn't break up because the relationship didn't work, they were working but taken away. Not mentioning her isn't going to help the girlfriend deal with this though. "
"You dodged a bullet with this one. 

If after all that he's back to dating her, he's clearly not someone you'd wanna build any future with. 

I'd consider myself lucky to be removed from all the drama, and I'd try to move on without ever thinking about them again. "
Well she has to be his chauffeur so she’s basically on call 24/7. 
"&gt; He said that he doesn't agree with me and doesn't want me to talk to him until I change my mind.

That's totally ridiculous. If he's gonna be such an asshole about it maybe break up with him, then you can just never talk about it again."
"For me, differences in kids would break up a relationship in the first year. You’re wasting time if you know you’re not going to be in it for the long haul in my opinion. 

5 years down the line and he decides he doesn’t want kids? You’ll resent him and break up (divorce probably by then) or he will have them anyway for you and resent you. You’ll be older and back to square one for finding a mate "
Even considering the grief aspect... it's still fucking crazy. Shows a remarkable lack of coping skills for sure.
"My boyfriend works in mental health and has a work phone that he also can't show me, due to confidentiality of his clients. I totally understand and it never occurred to me to be bothered by it, he's never given me any reason to doubt him. Just offering my perspective as I am in her position, but I think she is being unreasonable and overly suspicious.

Especially since she turned down your offer to look at your personal phone, it sounds like she just wants in on the ""secrets"" and it makes her crazy and hat you can't share."
"Your friend has the right idea, but making a video and tagging her in it is wrong. She was wronged just like you. "
You are making excuses for the guy. Don't let your feelings blind you to the fact that you have no idea who this man really is.
Don't make her birthday about yourself.
"If you had a crystal ball that told Boyfriend will never ever ever propose, what would you do? I would make your decision based on that. Either you’re willing to be with him anyway even though you’d prefer to get married and let go- *really* let go - of that idea, or being just a girlfriend/baby mama won’t be enough.

"
"How about you don't put any money down for his ridiculous new car, and he can just drive a normal car he pays for himself"
"I think homeboy just didn't pick out a christmas present, and came up with this trip idea because he didn't have anything else.  "
"&gt;Also my brother got annoyed at me enough that he hit me and my parents were cool with that and he’s not even in trouble, and its so crappy he gets away with every damn thing.

How old is the brother who hit you?

Your parents are never going to change. Don’t challenge them and just focus on your eventual independence. "
"Absolutely agree. These two lines stuck out to me the most:

&gt; She’s in so much pain, maybe she loves me?”  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I’m still lost, and for all I know she is too .

This projection is keeping OP building this narrative that Lily is some kind of fallen angel and now she's doing penance for her sins as the final step before they can finally be together and fulfill their destiny. But maybe also...her losing weight and falling into a depression could be just about attending an Ivy League grad program?"
Stop accepting your parents' rude behavior as normal filipino. You can be rude or respectful no matter what your nationality is. Don't subject your bf to your parents' comments.
"My mom was a SAHM for part of my childhood and she took care of the finances as part of her SAH duties, so things like bills being paid and check books being balanced and where the 401k was invested she managed. They made decisions together but just because my dad made the money didn't mean he owned it. The money was supposed to provide for us as a family and decisions were made by my parents for the family unit. 

Any other situation would be unimaginable to me"
"The important thing you can do, in addition to police assistance in retrieving your belongings, is to remember who she is.  She has just shown you who she is.  Don’t forget this.  This is a person who can cut off her children for something as trivial as sexual orientation. 

She wants to disown you?  Stay disowned.  She will come crawling back to your life when, say, you have children.  Don’t let her around your children.  She disowned you.  You’re no longer related.  Same for when she gets old and needs assistance.  She disowned you.  That means she’s on her own when Alzheimer’s comes around.  

Don’t believe her when she tries to claim she’s changed or claim she’s “forgiven” you (for what??), or whatever.  Some things are permanent, and disownment is one of them.  Block her number and cut her off.  "
"Why are you paying for groceries? Do not pay her half of the rent. You are too young to be financing this woman.

I moved in with my SO nearly 2 years into our relationship. Not once did he buy my groceries and the months I spent unemployed were payed for from my own savings. And I was younger than you guys.

Don't let circumstance convince you that you need to do anything. She needs to be the one panicking because a six month relationship is laughable in conjunction with these issues. I know sometimes things happen fast and without thought, but you shouldn't have even moved in with her after so short a period.

I'd be looking for a way out personally. Put the money you'd pay on her rent towards breaking your lease and find a few roommates. "
Is there anyone in your life who knows about the affair and who you trust who can read it for you and let you know? Maybe even your couples therapist? Because if it didn’t turn physical - seeing the texts of the emotional affair will dredge up and reverse any progress you have made in your relationship. It’s going to be like reliving it all over again but in graphic detail. 
"wait, she has been fucking some other dude for months, without protection, and you still want to be with her?   I dont understand that.   She may be pregnant, but I honestly hope its NOT your kid so you can dump her and have a cleaner break.  If it is yours then you are on the hook and have to see her regularly.  "
"This situation feels off to me. There's something strange about it my opinion and I'm not sure I would like it either. Has there been any other warning signs or uncomfortable situations in the past?

It seems that you've been fairly uncomfortable with Matt for quite sometime. Your girlfriend knows this but says ""don't know him well enough"" and their messages have kissing emojis...that's weird. I have male best friends and I can tell you that I would never said kissing emojis, that seems very inappropriate.

Also, why doesn't Matt want to take his fiance to this second trip? Wouldn't that make more sense? I think bottom line, you feel very uncomfortable with their friendship. The thing is Matt knows what your requests/conditions were for a trip taking place, and he's pushing to get around your wishes for this second trip. That's rude. Your fiance also knows how you feel and seems to have a history of brushing you aside and continuing her behavior with Matt...

""I think certain things are inappropriate no matter the length of the friendship and should be stopped or lessened but she is adamant that marriage should not change her friendships at all and that I should just understand that they are close."" This is actually a big problem. You have that mindset and she has hers. Unless you can compromise or she can, I don't see your marriage/relationship lasting. You both don't agree on what's appropriate for platonic relationships. That being said, I do think some of her behavior is inappropriate (kissing/flirty texts) and dodgy at best.


"
"This is excellent advice! Also, you could send the wife and daughter home for a few weeks at a time to give them a chance to see family. This could backfire on you, though, as she may realize how much she loves being home. On second thought, scratch that idea and bring people to her in Hawaii. 

My cousin and his wife and son live on Maui. His wife is from Mexico. They met when she was on vacation on Maui, and when she got home, she found out she was pregnant, so she moved to Hawaii knowing no one but my cousin (and hardly even knowing him!). She stays home with their son who just turned five. She had a hard time making friends at first, since she stays home. However, over time, she has made some really good friends through some local women’s networking/SAHM/empowerment groups. They absolutely LOVE it now. 

OP, do whatever you can to stay where you are. I would trade places with you in a minute! "
"So he deserves sympathy because he was kinda sexist (expecting the woman in the relationship to be the homemaker, make the house nice) and then disappointed that his new roomate didn't have more furniture?

Are you talking about THAT kind of disappointment being legit?  Cuz it's not.  He expected to have things done for him and hes disappointed that he's going to have to contibute half of everything in the relationship (like most partners who are in a healthy relationship do).  

Sounds like he wanted a bit of mom to live with him, like he's disappointed to find out he's going to have to be a full fledged adult.  Sorry, I don't really sympathize.  I mean, unless he was going to be the breadwinner lol."
My husband and I have separate bedrooms and are celebrating 10 years of marriage this year. I wish this would become more normalized. Whatever it takes to get good sleep!

"Seriously and what’s with the “when dad decides to run, you have to run with him or no tv.”  In what way does that teach kids to *enjoy* exercise?! 

Punishing a child for NOT doing something that is intended to be enjoyable is complete bullshit. “Oh you don’t want to do the totally fun thing you’re not actually enjoying? No TV for you!” "
"THIS is what has my blood boiling in this debate on social media. I live in the Deep South where everyone is religious/-Christian and seeing everyone sharing articles over this law change on FB and commenting “how sad that people can kill a baby a day before its birthday” and saying it’s disgusting and murderous....like did you guys also read the part where it’s only allowed if the mother’s life is AT RISK? Literally NO ONE is using abortion as a main form of birth control, walking into an abortion clinic at 7 months pregnant, and aborting a healthy baby because they decided they’re “not feeling it” anymore. The ignorance and misinformation is astounding. You just say the word “abortion” and they start frothing at the mouth..."
"Maybe she didn't want a fight? If someone said to me ""we are going home"" I'm going to assume that's not an argument I want to have in front of my friends. Sure she could have said she was staying, but he was also wrong to say they were leaving without consulting her. What *should* have happened is he said ""you look cold, would you rather go home?"". Because apparently he didn't even want to leave? "
"Just to add onto this, rules and consequences are important, and within that, consistency. If you make a rule and don't ever enforce it, or ignore behavior, that's worse than not having made the rule at all, because it teaches that nothing is firm and reliable.

The balance is don't make stupid rules, but don't be a pushover when you do make them. Which is different from changing your mind when that is reasonable- the thing I hated most as a child was adults refusing to admit when something wasn't working, and simply address the issue.

Communication, communication, communication- but remember that in the end, *you* are responsible for setting those boundaries and enforcing them."
"Just because you’re bisexual doesn’t automatically mean you will or you’re obligated to be attracted to a woman you originally grew romantically attached to as a man. But it also doesn’t mean it won’t happen. So don’t set expectations, give yourself some time and realize that whether you decide to stay in this or decide to part ways as a couple, youre going to be doing what’s perfectly right and acceptable for you.

Don’t push for something that doesn’t feel right because you feel obligated to, just give yourself some time."
"High school sucks, you are forced to hang out with people with whom you may have nothing in common. 
Sadly, it's tough being an introvert. I don't think it's your fault your friends are being assholes to you, I think they are just bad people. 
I do think that you should, if possible, go to therapy. I don't know where you are from and how that's viewed in your country, but it really helps. 
Also, you could start an extra-curricular activity that you are interested in, there you will find people interested in that subject too. I became friends with my two best friends at drama classes. 
Life is tough for an introvert 15 year old, I know, but you'll get through it, believe me, most of us did.

"If the picture in his head is something that is out of budget for the two of you, he'll need to get that picture out of is head. 

So the idea to ask Mel where she shops for stuff is actually not a bad one - but with the goal of going to look at the prices one afternoon, so that he can see what his ideal would actually cost.  

I have a bit of a champagne taste on a beer budget, so I sometimes browse high end furniture stores, stroke the nice table tops, sit on the sofa's, admire the lamps, then I look at the price tags, sigh, and go to Ikea. :-) "
"&gt; each have your own money and as long as bills are being paid and noone is involving their money in crimes or what have you, then the other partner's fun money is none of your business

Yeah, this is definitely my mindset, especially since I will always be the breadwinner by a large margin. Of course I would still discuss a large ($500+?) expense with him if it was coming out of my ""fun money"", because at the end of the day it *is* all shared money (especially since we live in a community property state, lol), but even this expense isn't close to that. We're talking *maybe* $300 + air miles I've personally accrued from work. If he has the right to ""veto"" such a decision now...how far will that go? I guess that's the conversation I need to be having with him. "

"I definitely think there are underlying issues that you might have always considered normal, but probably aren't.

You're engaged...presumably have regular sex...but you opted to skip brushing your teeth to avoid using the same toothbrush?  You used your clothes to dry off so as to not dry yourself off with her towel?  These things wouldn't even cause me to slow down - I'd use my boyfriend's toothbrush, and towel. 

You seem to REALLY value your own things, which is fine!  But I think it's, like someone mentioned, perhaps more of a fixation or obsession."

"I would definitely suggest being more firm on the couples counseling or consider separating. Unless her counselor says it is a bad idea, there is no reason to delay that. 

But also consider what YOU want in the meantime. Do you want to stay with someone who's kept you at arms length for a year and now seems pretty wishy washy on your entire relationship? I wouldn't but that's easy for me to say not being in your actual relationship of course. "
"this....my father acts like a saint even though hes been drunk for the better part of my entire life, a sociopath/narcissist and acts extremely nice around everyone else.

I think it's fine for her to bring it up and have feelings about it, but at the end of the day she has to decide whether she can live with your decision or not. You don't have an obligation to change it to please her. "
"My Ex pretty much did the same thing but it was his FB account that had a bunch of women he’d met via online dating websites and added them as friends on Facebook. We talked several times about him deleting them off and he would say he would, then lie and say they are friends from high school. Durning our relationship he definitely chatted (inappropriately for our relationship) with these women. 3 years later they were still on his FB and he was still hiding and deleting messages. 

He also got upset having to delete these women off, in my opinion it was because they fueled his ego, he needed them and couldn’t let them go. 

FUCK THAT.  I think it’s reasonable to ask, and do. And his lack of doing so for me was a problem. I will not be in another relationship with a man that intends on keeping females (he doesn’t even know) on his FB. 

He also wouldn’t post about us at all, he would flirt with them on social media while I wouldn’t get any attention (in person or on social media). 

"
"This is bizarre because he already owns a home with you and wants to live there for at least 10 years.

He is demonstrating that he is unwilling to compromise, territorial, unaware of your feelings. He expects you to just let this go. Those are multiple signs of a really bad boyfriend and you should really reevaluate the relationship (or at the very least go to counseling to talk about the causes of his issues$."
"6 years together and *fifteen pounds* turns him into a dead bedroom lover? *Yikes*. Superficial as *fuck*. If those are his standards he'd better be sculpted like a goddamn Adonis; at least then there'd be *some* small measure of justification.

The two of you need to sit down and have a long, serious talk about this. Because it sounds like *neither* of you were communicating properly during that dead bedroom time span. "
"I wouldn't respond via phone, email or social media but I would send her a certified cease and desist to stop contacting you and that you consider it harassment (templates can be found online). It's not legally binding so I wouldn't bother to send it through an attorney or anything but it sends a clear message and you can contact authorities to tell her to stop contacting you after that. Helps create a paper trail that she's harassing you. Keep the cert receipt with a copy. Any future ""gifts"" take a picture. If she shows up at your house or your mother's have anyone who answers the door film it telling her to go away and that she's trespassing and not welcome. "
"Seriously though he is exhibiting classic passive agressive controlling behavior.  He manipulates the situation so you always come off as the one who messed up or did something wrong.

I almost garuntee you that if you picked something cheap he'd have a problem with that too.  'You think I'm poor?  Think I dont make enough money?' Etc.

The crappy part is  he may not even realize he is acting this way.  So, if you see a future with him let him know how you feel and how you are perceiving his behavior and see what he does with that.  He could either acknowledge it and make a change (doubful) or defend it and tell you you're overreacting (unfortunately likely). 

If you dont see a future then cut it off now and save yourself some pain.  You will almost 100% regret going on this trip if he continues to be this passive agressive."
"This is why it’s great to live with your partner before marriage. You’ve seen that you two are incompatable now that you’ve lived with him. The important thing here isn’t who’s more messy, it’s the fact that he won’t communicat with you and is unwilling to work as a team. I’d have one more serious talk with him but then throw in the towel if he doesn’t show effort and willingness to make a change. "
Your husband is abusing your kids and it sounds like he's been emotionally abusing you for so long you can't quite see what's happening. because you're scared to stand up to him The rule that the kids have to run with him to earn TV isn't healthy either (if you're worried about their activity levels there are way better ways to motivate them than hanging access to screen time on one activity)  The way to handle this is to seek outside professional help. Counseling for everybody. 
"30 gay guy here. When I was younger (16-18), I was really embarrassed and uncomfortable around 'stereotypical' gay men and anxious in visibly gay spaces. For me this was just internalised shame and homophobia. This is a very common thing.

Shame and anxiety are hard feelings to avoid when they've been your constant companion for a decade or more. Growing up I did everything possible to hide who I was. It can be really jarring to go from that to being faced with unabashed gayness head on.

I still will occasionally feel a pang of shame and disgust arise when around really overt gayness, despite being very comfortable with myself and loving my ridiculously creative friends. When it happens, I try to remember what it was like to live in constant fear, and think about far I've come. This usually helps me to calm down and puts the feeling into perspective. It also helps me to reflect on just how brave those 'feminine' or 'catty' guys I might define myself against are.

When it happens to you, perhaps try to just sit and reflect on the anxiety.  You may be able to use the opportunity to get reacquainted with the closed kid that still lurks somewhere below."
"^ you’ve already acknowledged your mother is evil; treat her like it. 

She isn’t special because your dad came inside her, or because you or your siblings came out of her, nor are they victims for clearly abusing and manipulating the system and family and *still* having no security or quality of life to show for it after all of the shit they’ve already done.

You have your own life, and a family to worry about. Do what everyone else said: freeze your credit, talk to a lawyer, make sure they can’t pull you down with them. All they’re trying to do is use you as a buoy to prevent them from drowning in their own shit. Pathetic.

"Girl I’m going to be blunt. You’ve got some really deeply internalized misogyny all over this post. Unless your boyfriend has proven to be a shady asshole (in which case yes, break up) he is fully capable of having a pretty female roommate without cheating on you. And also you’ve got some toxic shit to say about this lady and her perfectly legal job. She makes a living from her looks, so what? Women who make a living from their looks are not inherently seductive cheaters, or dumb bimbos. I’d honestly suggest some therapy and also feminist blogs, because you seem very insecure and like you’re torpedoing something that brings you joy because of some ugly stereotypes you’ve internalized."

Does he not consider you family? Because he abandoned you too. 
"That's her plan, to make you feel like a bad daughter so you'll do what she wants. And it'll never end. There'll never be a point where she'll say, ""okay, you've done enough for me, I'll stop asking you for more."" There will always be more that she wants you to do for her.

So start saying no now. "
"If your wife can become sexually turned off because you’re adults and have to pay bills then unfortunately your marriage is over. That might be the most selfish and childish thing I’ve ever heard. She has no respect for your feelings or your relationship. She has changed the rules, not you. It will be hard emotionally to leave her and move on with your life but it will be even more emotionally painful if you stay. Either she will convince you to have an open marriage that will destroy you or she will cheat on you and destroy you. Don’t be talked into doing something that will make you feel unhappy.
I wish you the best of luck but I don’t think you’ll need it. It might hurt but you’ll be fine without her."
"&gt;He told me he was just saying that so he could marry me and wait for me to change my mind, but I'd been taking too long (his words).

Fuck this lying bastard. He deliberately mislead you so that he could override your clear and consistent stance on kids. I’m so sorry OP.

This is the end of the line. Your marriage was founded on a lie and you each want fundamentally opposite things. Seek a lawyer as soon as you can and don’t have sex with him in the interim. I wouldn’t put it past him to sabotage birth control to achieve his ends. "

"The kids are young, unless they were indoctrinated hardcore into the anti-gay stuff I think they'll learn to accept it pretty quickly. A lot of conservative parents don't even tell their kids anything about gay people because they view it as inherently inappropriate.

The accuracy of this comment to the real life situation is freaking me out a little bit lol 
"Dude, please get out of this. He’s depressed, alcoholic, and potentially abusive based on your post. It doesn’t sound like he’s taking any of this seriously by seeking professional help. He’s spiraling and doesn’t care to stop it. Questioning you about leaving and cheating makes me wonder what he’s up to as it sounds a bit like projection to me. 

So many of my friends and the guys I see on Reddit and elsewhere stay in these terrible relationships after finding someone out of fear. It’s common with everyone but it’s especially common for us gay guys. You can do better than this. You aren’t responsible for his behavior. You can’t let someone else tear the life you’ve built down.

"Sounds like stimulant abuse to me. Doesn't sleep, fast heart rate, suppressed appetite, goes on flurries of organization and cleaning during the day.

Right? Yeah this dude seems so confident and secure. 
Dude no...you're being foolish here and she is taking advantage of you. 
Sorry this is happening but have some self respect. “Hope this is okay”? He just kicked you out of his house while you took care of the home and HIS kids. Don’t let people walk all over you. Love and respect yourself enough to not let shitty people doubt your value.

"
"I am going to be very blunt. You should immediately cut contact with this man. This is a pathological liar who is showing a very keen interest in your daughter and you are completely taken in by his false promises. What if he is just using you to gain access to your daughter? 

You say that you don't want to date anyone else and you should go with those feelings. Don't date anyone for awhile and figure out how to be single."
"Man that's rough. I really hope her chemo goes well. 

As you know, it's going to be very draining for her. Chemo for leukemia (just making an assumption) is no joke.

The good news is at her age she will likely handle the chemo decently well. 

I know you've said she's too tired/ill to write to you or talk on the phone, but she will have more energy in a few months. I would keep writing to her. Send her cards and letters with just normal conversation type things. Either she can read them when she feels up to it, or her mom can read them to her. And perhaps short little videos once or twice a week where you just tell her about your life and that you hope she's feeling better and include hellos from friends and cameos of any cute pets. It's a constant reminder that she is loved. And include any tips on podcasts/audiobooks/Netflix you think she might like and don't require a ton of attention to keep track of plotlines. She might be super bored at some points so having a list of stuff for distraction might be nice. Especially if it's stuff she can talk to you about if she feels up to it. 

Check with her mom about what is allowed in her room and send her a care package. I know sometimes they like to keep patients in the hospital until blood counts start to recover, which can be up to 4 weeks. So send her little things to make her room feel more like home. Preferably things that are easy to clean. Like Funko Pop vinyl figures of her favorite show/movie. Also things for comfort (that can be washed) like a knit hat or cozy blanket. 

She's likely to have a looooot of nausea. So maybe include ginger tea or chews or gum in the care package to help. She'll also likely get dry mouth or mouth sores so a nice lip balm and hard candies. And if it's allowed maybe a really nice hand/body cream. 

Also, even if you can't go in and see her, stop by the hospital when you can to bring her mom food/snacks/coffee/reading material. Or even puzzle type things like Sudoku books. Her family needs support too in order to care for her the best they can. 

Oh and I feel like sending her/her mom links to videos of cute animals might be nice. Especially baby animals. They lift everyone's spirits a bit. Especially the baby hippo Fiona at the Cincinnati zoo. She's so cute. "
"TL:DR I've been in her very position, and I recommend two books that could help her like they did me.


I think it's worth noting it's likely she has developed very unhealthy views on food and exercise (super common, especially in today's world of ads and social media), and it's multiplied further if she's struggled with depression and/or anxiety. I know cause I've been there. A few years ago, your post would have described me verbatim, down to the frustrated significant other. For me, eating healthy food and exercise were ways to punish myself for not being thin/attractive enough rather than tools to improve my well-being. But seeing it as punishment traps you in a downward spiral where you can never find the energy to change your habits, stick to a meal plan or exercise regiment, so you quickly revert to eating what feels good to you and avoiding the gym, since it's a reminder that you aren't ""good enough"" yet. For me, verbalizing my worries about my weight/body were ways to signal to my then-boyfriend ""I need validation."" But like you, he got to the point where he was frustrated and resorted to ""if you're upset about your weight then why don't you do something about it?"" But the ""do something"" is so much deeper than just going to the gym or portion control, it's right at her core of self-worth. I would highly, HIGHLY recommend two books that really helped me: ""Body Positive Power"" by Megan Jayne Crabbe, and ""Intitutive Eating."" Both of these helped me shift my views on diet and exercise into a much more positive light, and while I'm still learning (it's not an overnight fix) I've massively improved not just my physical health, but my mental health as well."
"Wow. I think you went into this with expectations that are far too high. Your dad abandoned you and didn't contact you for 47 years. And you think he's some sort of good person that you're going to be able to have a relationship with? 

What he's probably dealing with is a wife that will absolutely flip her shit when she finds out that he abandoned a kid. That would change anybody's view of another person. If he tells her, she'll probably divorce him. Which, since he's selfish, he isn't interested in doing.

So this is what he's offering. You can have a relationship but remain secret. 

Whether you are okay with that is up to you, but I'm shocked that you went in with expectations that you were going to fall in like long-last family. Somebody needs to help you dial that all back like yesterday.

"
Yep - your boyfriend just showed his true colors if a shaved head is that big of an issue for him. You're better off without him.
"Thank you. I honestly am just exhausted. I’ve spent the last year being so anxious for him and his finances, while he never seemed too worried about them. Probably because I’ve been supporting him so why would we worry. "
"This 100%. 

I’d add that it’s not her telling him how to live his life. His choice to have two small children decided how his life must be lived.

I have two small children nearly the same age as OPs. I still play video games. But you have to realize sometimes you need to hang it up at 1230 and get to sleep (or have a couple beers with buddies instead of 15, or stay in when you’d like to go out all together, etc) because these two little lives depend on you.

Time for him to grow the hell up."
"Then he needs to do the planning! He put you into a situation that was no-win for you. 

Gave you a promise for a present
Told you it was carte blanche 
Shot down your ideas (“no Jamaica”)
Got mad at your other suggestion because it violated his unspoken boundary 
Refuses to discuss with you further 

Now he gets to be mad/martyred and hold that over your head while not delivering on his promise. "
"OP: there's a brilliant book called Exposing Financial Abuse by Shannon Thomas (available safely on e-reader as I think it would not be wise to show your research on this subject to your fiance since he is not being untrustworthy.

There's a really penny dropping moment in it where she explains that manipulative people can adapt to financial abuse by turning it to their own ends. 

A parent drains you dry and you take out loans and then you realise that the 'untouchable' excuse of your abusive mom allows you to start draining your partner dry to 'balance' the abuse out. They play on your sympathy to not address the root cause. It's enabling and abuse wrapped up together.

Your fiance very likely has a financially abusive family but he has also kept large lies from you mixed in with truths so do you know for sure that all this money at this interest rate is due to his mom and there's none of his own financial behaviour in there? 

Are you sure he isn't taking out extra debt or not bothering to solve financial errors because now he has a cast iron excuse you can't touch him with? Just because someone has been abused does not mean they can't be manipulative and abusive themselves.

And in this case he's been more honest with his intention to fuck you over financially than how the problem was was created. That's the red flag of all time. You sound somewhat naive and uncertain about what marriage 'should' entail emotionally and is actually legally.

I think this guy is break upworthy but I also think you should see a financial advisor separately to get advice to protect and educate yourself. You need to check your credit, protect any assets and generally get yourself in a stable frame of financial mind that people can't coerce and wear you down with because you have facts and certainty.

Also pop over to r/JUSTNOMIL to find out what happens when you marry a mama's boy with a financial umbilical cord to his ghastly mother. It can destroy your mental health and utterly ruin your finances so there is no escape route down the line.

Don't assume he's actually trying to work with you to fix this and you are a team. A real team member desn't plan to hold people to ransom.

"Here's the big thing about buying a house with someone else:  If you buy a house with a spouse and your marriage doesn't work out, divorce court dispositions the house (sell it and split the proceeds, one person buy out the other, etc...).  If you buy a house with someone to whom you aren't married, and the relationship doesn't work out, the process to get out from under the joint ownership of the house can be even more involved and more expensive (you'd need a partition sale).

There have been multiple horror stories over on r/personalfinance and r/legaladvice of people who bought a house with an unmarried SO and then are stuck living together after the relationship went bad or who can't get a bad Ex to move out of a joint-owned house, or who are stuck paying on a house they can't get an Ex to sell.

You have a couple options:  The two of you could get married before buying a house.  Your BF could buy a house in just his name and you could pay him rent to share the living space in the house.  Or you could just keep your current living accommodations."

Bullshit. He's making excuses for his asshole behavior. Also, from the things you've described, it sounds like he's started to reveal his true self over time and it isn't pretty. 

Care, reassurance, and concern is baseline behavior from a spouse. It's not supposed to be extra or special - it's what any spouse signs up for. He can't even do that. "
Just 2 months ago you were posting that you need to leave him.... You don't need him to admit anything.

"Ask her to write to you instead. Give her paper, stamps and self-addressed envelopes. "
It should be pretty easy. OP tells them not to bring her. When they bring her the next time and things go south OP can point to that and say “this is why I am limiting my contact. If you bring her again you can’t come either. I don’t want this in my life anymore.” And then stick to it. 
"What a massive fucking tool.

Seriously he wants to limit your potential AND have less money so he can feel like the ‘man’?

"A lot of older people who choose to date significantly younger people are categorically _immature_ for their ages. This isn't universally true, but generally another 22 year old who is also mature for their age is probably a more mature person and better partner than someone in their 30s who seeks to date 22 year olds. "
"Yeah this post is pretty alarming. As someone who works with adults who have a myriad of problems due to their horrible upbringings, I think it's super important that OP recognizes that ANYTHING that happens to her children when they're young will stick with them forever. So many part of a child's worldview are developed when they're very little, and this type of abuse at this age is damaging. 

Please please, OP, get out of this relationship before the abuse (potentially but I hope not for yours and the kids' sake) escalates. IF you aren't in a place to completely end the marriage, then consider taking the kids and staying somewhere else while you encourage your husband to seek out treatment. Continuing to expose them to this dynamic is really harmful. "
Just the fact that OP is their disowned sibling is going to complicate things. What have they heard about him? Did they hear about him at all? But I do agree that I think they can work through this.
if she wants complete economic independence then it's only fair to split the bills evenly. She's being completely irrational and the red flags are flying OP. 
"To add to the list we find out in the comments that: 

- OP is the only adult involved that keeps up with the children’s schedule as both the mom/ex and the father/husband are too lazy to manage that. 

- it’s OP’s name on the mortgage and the bills, although they supposedly pay those 50/50. She also mentions that most of the husband’s money goes into child support and that she bought most of the presents for the kids around Christmas - so it seems that she takes on a lot of the financial burden without realising it. 

- the husband couldn’t afford their current house on his own. Clearly OP is taking on a lot financially by being in this relationship. 

To OP: I understand that you feel responsible for and love your step kids. The problem is that their parents suck and there is nothing you can do to change that. The kids might love you and be thankful to have you in their life, but the hurt from their parents being shitty parents aren’t going to go away. There’s nothing you can do about that, only the parents can fix that.

It is also completely possible for their parents to take away your access to them at any given time. Seeing as your husband seems to be thinking about divorce already this is a real possibility. The best you can hope for in a divorce is that the kids will want to stay in touch and that you can be a positive role model. The kids need that more than you staying with their dad or you buying them a gigantic house. 

On another note you met when you were 24 and he was 34, so while you weren’t a teenager you were still very young and 10 years his junior. Age gaps doesn’t have to be a problem, but it becomes one when the older more experienced partner leverages their advantage. I feel a lot of your need to ask your husband’s permission to do stuff, and you continuing to defend him in this thread could be explained by your husband slowly brainwashing or gaslighting you. “You’re too controlling” (when you’re trying to order food for his kids?!?!). “You’re self centred” (after you spent the entire weekend taking care of his kids and wants to do a family activity?!?!)."
"I mean they should know you have a kid. 

But they shouldn't be meeting her this early. Or talking specifically about how excited they are to be a step parent this early. That's just creepy. 

Also, maybe you're struggling with dating because you're coming across a bit . . . Um . . . Desperate . . .  if you're actually asking them if they want to be a step parent. If they know you have a kid they know they'd be a step parent if the relationship works out. 

But their role in your daughter's life shouldn't even exist until you know they're serious long term potential. And two months is INSANELY early for that. 

Your daughter needs stability. And meeting someone you've only been dating for 2 months is not that. 

Nor is continuing to date a conman. "
"&gt;Am I responsible for this since we are married?!

Yes.

The two of you need to sit down and lay out a budget so that you don't go deeper into debt.  "
"Nurse here, my  main patient population is debilitated elderly folks. You can hotline people for self-neglect. It also might be a good idea to look into out patient physical therapy and/or Home health. (A lot of home health agencies offer home physical and occupational therapy, sounds like she would benefit from both.) bowel incontinence and poor hygiene can lead to urinary tract infections which can absolutely kill people. It’s hard to help someone who doesn’t want help, good luck."
"An open relationship doesn't mean no feelings and no commitment. It just means you can also have sex with other people. What you're talking about sounds more like FWB. In any case, if you can't handle being invested emotionally in someone and being ok with them having sex with other people, then it's not an open relationship you're looking for."
"Here's something to remember too, for when it gets hard- I'm a nanny to 3 wonderful kids who have not experienced major trauma that I am aware of. I've been with them for years. They (the youngest especially) still cry for mom/ dad when they're in trouble with me, and say they want Miss Astraea when they're in trouble with mom and dad. Kids just do that. It doesnt mean you're doing anything wrong, and these girls especially are just gonna have times when they really miss their mom and dad. It sounds like y'all are super caring, and you're doing a wonderful thing providing a stable, loving home for these kids. "
"Welp. Lesson learned, I hope. If you want to be exclusive with someone (or at least set boundaries on who you can each sleep with), the time to discuss that is sooner rather than later. 

If the well is poisoned, you need to move on. Tell her (respectfully! calmly!) that you feel like this thing has run its course and it’s time to part ways. Then spend some time working on your communication skills and improving your emotional intelligence. Start actually identifying what you’re feeling, WHILE you’re feeling it, and figuring out how to put it into words. It’ll do you a world of good in the future. "
"Adding my .02 here. I have a ton of insecurities due to past relationships. I have been in therapy for almost 2 years now working on them, and my boyfriend *did* enable them to a point much like you did, he just didn't get to this point where he was so frustrated with me. But it didn't help me at all, it just made my insecurities worse and inevitably took a toll on our relationship. I had to cut myself off cold turkey from trying to soothe those insecurities and really deal with them in my therapy sessions in order to get better, and my boyfriend was extremely supportive in this, but he was firm that he couldn't take my snooping anymore. But I had to want to get better, and I genuinely did, I just used a crutch for far too long that turned into a whole other issue.

I quit snooping around 8 months ago now, and our relationship is close to perfect. A lot of guys wouldn't have given me the chance to fix myself, but I am grateful he did because I really really wanted to be better. 

This is her problem to fix. And she has to *want* to fix it. If she doesn't, I think you should leave her, because you're already clearly resentful of her behavior."
"You are making a huge assumption that ""he took the test knowing there was a possibility of finding you"". What if he put you out of his mind years and decades ago, and *forgot you were a possibility*. I don't care what he told you, there is always the possibility that he thought he could get away with abandoning you."
This needs to be further up. He leaves her behind with his family..really?! I would hate that.
"The truth probably is somewhere in the middle. Addiction can cause some really awful behaviour and it sounds like your boyfriend had some insight to get help. But he sounds rather dismissive of so much of it all, the ex is the dramatic one, he is the innocent one. There's no shame in admitting there was awful behaviour, but he's rather portraying her as crazy. If problems aren't recognized, they can't be fixed. So that's something to look into. 

It sounds like you got the improved version, but that version still is not done with problems, he still hasn't gotten everything together. "
"&gt; do not like feeling like we have to be quiet when we’re in our own common area in the morning

Yeah, so don't do that anymore. I think the problem will resolve itself if you start grinding fresh coffee at 630 AM and turn the TV on to the weather channel. "
"I was in a rush as I'm at work and was upset after hearing this...failed to mention:

**she screamed in my fiance's face.

Shoved him down the stairs but thankfully he caught himself on the bannister and I was also behind him.

Called me an evil bitch.**


Still livid here and appalled that she would even do this...not sure why I'm surprised but still. It really fucking sucks."
"It could cause issues for YOU. Not necessarily for him. You can try telling him but I’d guess he will mock you and keep doing this.

If he’s doing this crap to people who don’t like it then he’s not a very good friend. Perhaps it’s time to move on?"
"There's a lot going on here but the biggest thing I see is the sexual incompatibility. That is not going away and the issues will only get worse. Check out /r/DeadBedrooms for what a potential future with this guy may be like.

I really think you need to slow your roll here and reevaluate your relationship with someone you can't trust and doesn't meet your needs."
"This. It's not really any harder to make 2-4 portions of a meal than it is to make 1, so I'm not sure that cooking only for yourself is the best answer here. But there are definitely things he can do to make it easier on you - acting as sous chef, cleaning the kitchen, taking on primary responsibility for other chores, etc.

You also don't mention whether there's an *expectation* that you cook every night. I do nearly all the cooking in my house, but that also means that I have the right to say ""not feeling up to it tonight,"" and we just do simple pasta or toss a frozen pizza in the oven."
"The fact that you've only been talking for fourteen days is a HUGE detail that you should add to the OP. You're both still adjusting and processing this in your own way.

It's understandable that you don't want to feel like a secret, but you have to give him some time to process all of this and figure out how and when to share this information with his wife. Pushing him to do that after just two weeks is not fair.

If he's still hiding you in three months, then you have a fair point. For now, focus on your own emotions instead of trying to control the actions of someone who is essentially a complete stranger."
"I'd wager they don't believe in divorce, either. So she's just supposed to ""give herself forever"" to a complete stranger within 50 weeks. Fuck that, OP. Thus is a gigantic safety issue, what they want ia insane. Cut off contact for now, you're worthy of safety. You'll be so much better off  with an apartment of your own and a couple of pets. "
"&gt; ""I hate feeling like I have to defend him from you""   
&gt;  
&gt; I feel like it was pretty clear I was appealing to the fact that I do think she cares about him 

**Then use better words.** I mean for fuck's sake you're 32, not 13, and you're bickering like teenagers. You're both fixated on being ""right"" rather than, let me blow your mind, **you both being different people with different perceptions of temperature**. You've fought **for years** about a 7 degree difference?! Split the difference, put a sweater on, crack a window open and shut the fuck up the pair of you.

&gt; Both of us are really stubborn and neither are agreeing to apologize. 

Why? ""Stubborn"" doesn't cut it - that's a personality failing, not a trait, and you don't get to hide behind it. Why are you so afraid of your wife ""winning"", or feeling like you've backed down? Why is fighting about this and screaming at each other over something **this fucking trivial** more important to both of you than the happiness of your relationship and more importantly **the wellbeing of your child**?

66F is about 19 degrees Celcius. The ideal temperature for a child's room is 16-20°C, which is a) pretty widely agreed on, and b) a pretty broad range. He's not going to catch hypothermia, and again, **just because you find it cold, doesn't mean it IS cold.** That is absolutely not a cold enough temperature for a child to be miserable, providing they're dressed appropriately, and you freaking out it this much is absolutely unreasonable.

In short, YES what you said was out of line. You're fixated on your perception of temperature being right (and in case it matters, I'm someone who always runs hot, and guess what? I recognise that it's my issue, I don't start dictating to people that we need windows open in winter), you're projecting your own internal thermostat onto your child, and most importantly your communication with your wife is **appalling**. She's not showered herself in glory here either, BTW, but she's not the one posting.

For fuck's sake apologise - what will it cost you? That's a genuine question - why not acknowledge that implying your child needs ""defending"" from **your wife, his mother** is a shitty thing to say and you shouldn't have done it? Can you honestly tell me you can't think of a single better approach? She's right to be mad, and you're acting like a jerk. She didn't make her room freezing, and you have no idea why your child was unhappy - as the dad of a 1 year old myself it could be a thousand things, and the temperature is way, way down the list. Grow up."
"Hey man I’m a guy that’s similar to your girlfriend as far as her past and habits are concerned. I also needed to be reassured constantly and given an unreasonable amount of attention, and if my ex didn’t express her love for me physically Or want to spend time with me then I just couldn’t believe it was true. Where your girlfriend makes passive aggressive posts I kept my shit bottled up and tried to fake happiness until it ruined me and I wasn’t myself. My ex was an amazing girl I didn’t appreciate properly because her “acts of service” way of loving didn’t click with me. Hindsight is 20/20 and I didn’t even realize what was right in front of me and the situation I created in my head with all my insecurities and shit became a self fulfilling prophecy of my ex losing the ability to love me. The point I’m trying to make is that you’ve done what you could. My ex did everything she could but I became a toxic piece of shit with her by being caught up in my own head and fears and letting it corrupt my behavior. And I did that without even realizing the damage I was doing. Deep down she probably does still love you quite a bit, but what she needs is to be alone. I don’t think it’s possible for her to fix the things she needs to while being in a relationship, and even if she can it’s not fair to you to have to trade your own happiness for her personal mental health improvement. You’re responsible for your own happiness and it’s not fair for her to expect you to trade yours in for her to be able to feel loved. I hope this helps man, you’re a good guy for trying as long as you have. Maybe one day she’ll be able to patch up the damage her life has dealt her, but right now she’s just not in a place where she can love or be loved properly.  Just my two cents, most people can give better advice about this sort of thing, hope it helps and that you find someone that appreciates you the way you deserve man. Good luck. "
"OP your husband lied to you to manipulate you into marrying him. And you are right, kids are the ultimate deal breaker. There is no having half a child, no magic compromise. You need to call up a divorce lawyer and get started on a separation.   


You are still so young, you have so much of your life left to live. Go out and enjoy it, find someone whose values align with yours. "
"Yeah, he didn't admit it to you, either. You had to dig for information until he was forced to admit it."
"Your coworkers are 100% wrong. They’re blaming the victim, you, for something that was not your fault. That man assaulted you and the authorities took appropriate action and fired him. 

Take another job and get away from these people. And keep working in therapy to get to the point where no one can make you think thoughts like “should my boyfriend be ashamed of me”. Of course not! "
Have you talked to your mum? She should definitely bring this up with your sister.
