So why don’t you bring it up again and ask for specifics?
"&gt;While we were picking up the bags, I leaned over and whispered to him that it's sexy to watch him lift the bags off the conveyor belt. Our daughter was asleep in the stroller when this happened, and I whispered quietly so she wouldn't have heard me even if she were awake. He snapped at me really loudly and said ""do NOT say those things in front of MY child.""

...she's seven months old. Is he aware she has absolutely no idea what either of you are even saying at this point, even if she HAD been awake?

&gt;He turned and left our house and I haven't seen him in almost two days. 

wtf? is he always volatile like this? this is fucked up, would he go to counseling?"
"&gt; But I want the old Grammy

There is no such thing. She was always this nasty, cold-hearted person, it just wasn't directed at you. Now that you're no longer receiving the benefits of being a favorite, you're seeing the real her. People like this love to use their attention and money to keep other people dancing on their strings, so even if she did suddenly flip and decide to dote on you again it would always carry the threat that it could be taken away if you don't appease her. Do you really want a person like that in your life?

Take this as a lesson learned that if someone is nice to you but nasty to others, they're not actually nice."
"“Your sister attempted to kill her self and *I* was inconvenienced! Wah!” 

Tell him that life or death situations are more important than holidays and you’d gladly celebrate Christmas now if he’d stop being a whiny little ass about it."
"If it’s anyone’s fault it’s his. Who fucking grabs someone while they’re holding a child? He sounds very domineering towards you. 

Don’t pay for this yourself. "
"&gt;He says people have different skills and that anyone who’s claimed to be stupid can learn and be considered smart.

So he's not just intellectually gifted, but also level-headed, reasonable and articulate? Hold on to this guy. "
I would double check with landlord that he actually DID pay the rent. 
"Here's my advice: stop apologizing, immediately. He needs to grow up, life throws curveballs, adults cope. God forbid something really bad ever happens, and ruins some important national holiday like his birthday."
"Sometimes you just can't get over something. You gave it more than a fair shot by staying a full year. You don't trust him, he doesn't really seem to acknowledge what he did and that it was his fault, you're just miserable... Time to move on."
"I am really concerned about how much she is lying to your father, her *husband*. He also *knows* she is lying. And she told a pretty big lie to an entire group of friends. This is really troubling. 

But wow, did you all handle the situation well! Wow! Great job there. I think she absolutely wanted you to grovel (what did she want you to apologize for anyway?), and you just went about your plans. I'm glad Dad followed through as well and visited. Just brilliant, calm, mature behavior shown by the three of you. 

And what a great Christmas gift! Congrats! "
This is sweet. Try not to feel bad. You both sound like really kind thoughtful people. 
I'm sorry you're going through that. It seems like there's something going on that's deeper than what's being explained in the story. How he reacted was extremely inappropriate. Has he ever blown his cool like that before in public?
"To be clear, irrespective of anything else, your boyfriend is being a whiny little shit.

Yes, it sucks your plans got thrown out. That is no reason to freeze your partner out.

If I were you, I wouldn't do anything to make it up to him, except, perhaps, hold a belated Christmas"
He’s 28. He’d be in his senior years but probably retired if he played professionally consistently in the us. He’s being delusional and you shouldn’t put your career in jeopardy for someone that can’t even make it in the Orioles minor league team. 
"Usually inheritance is not community property, and that's all well and good.  But you guys have KIDS and are living paycheck to paycheck.  Did he even think of his kids?  $35,000 is a lot of money and unless you were seriously behind on your bills, and you aren't now, there's no way he spent it on the 'household'.  You need to sit down and ask him to be honest with you and tell you where all that money went.  What about savings for the kids?  What about an emergency fund for the family?  He HID this from you and you never would have known if not for the cousin.  "
"If you do this it will ruin your entire life.

Your girlfriend is not mentally stable. She needs grief counseling, not a child before she is capable of supporting one."
"He thinks ""his"" 7mo child can understand what you said? Or that calling your husband sexy is somehow wrong even if you said it in front of YOUR (plural) 16-year-old child? 

And leaving for two days? Something major is up. This is COMPLETELY out of line of him. Can someone come and stay with you and the baby? (**Weird the baby hasn't been HIS for the last two days.**) Do you have a car of your own and access to money? That line about ""something I'd regret"" is chilling. "
"Minister here.

If I were the officiant for the two of you, and I knew of this history and situation, I would decline to perform your ceremony.

A marriage never *ever* fixes anything between two people.

A marriage should (in fact, in my opinion, *must*) be an affirmation between two people that the relationship is so amazing, so awesome, so magical *as it is right now* that you want to step before one another, and friends, and family, and the law and (if you're religious) the Infinite Divine and make a solemn covenant that each of you will do everything you have within your power to make certain that it *stays* this amazing.

If you have an engagement to a guy who wants to ""take a break"" so that he can go sleep around, then you do not have an engagement at all; you have a toxic cesspit of a relationship, which you are clinging to out of fear, not out of love.

Leaving will be hard.  It will be *terrifying* at times.  Do it anyway, because this is as good as things are *ever* going to get with him, and if you allow him to talk you into marriage, his behavior will not change, but then you'll be even *more* hesitant to do what needs to be done."
"You need to be really clear. ""I'm not comfortable sharing finances with someone I barely know. In the future we're each going to pay our share of rent separately and we're going to handle all our groceries and food separately. I meal plan so please don't use my stuff. If we want to organize a roommate dinner every so often we can totally go in half for that, but I'm sure you understand that we are each responsible for our own meals/costs/etc."""
"Body dysmorphia. Absolutely sure of it. 

This is waaaayyy above your pay grade. Your husband needs professional help, and you can’t provide it. What you *can* do is seek out a therapist that specializes in body issues, and go speak to them yourself to find out how best to navigate life with an unwell partner. Talk to them about his behaviors, your fears, the impact it’s having on your marriage. They’ll be able to guide you far better than we can. "
"Do not have sex with this person, not even once. She needs professional help you can’t provide. "
"&gt;He's very remorseful sometimes. Other times he will tell me that it's partially my fault 

If he *ever* tries to blame you for his cheating, he's not remorseful. He may regret that you uncovered his affair but he's not remorseful.

He was cheating on you because he has poor boundaries and he will cheat again because he's never faced up to his fault in crossing boundaries with someone else.   He's had a year to show you that he understands what he did any yet still wants to claim that he wasn't really responsible.

There is no future in a relationship with someone who doesn't take responsibility for hurting you and who is not actively trying to rebuild your trust (which by the way takes at least 2 years when the cheater is doing every he can).  You need to end this no-win relationship.






"
"&gt;We have been together 1 year.

Honestly OP - fuck this relationship. Your mental and emotional wellbeing is leagues more important than your boyfriend's disapproval or screwed up beliefs. Why would you ever prioritize a boyfriend over you? Stop this and go get help. Ditch the asshat."
"Nope. My ex convinced me to give up everything for his dreams. 7 years later I’m left with nothing. 


Do u boo boo"
"Why on earth would you apologize for checking the nanny cam--seems reasonable to me--when your child is screaming and your idiot husband is lying about why? Which you already know because it's not an unusual occurance, and the nanny cam simply confirmed it? And you're apologizing? Haha.

His exploding in anger, storming out, is just his reaction to being caught lying, neglecting your child, and generally being a fuckwidget. It's intended to shut you up and flip the script. Don't fall for it."
"You've got this. Just imagine you were him. What would you want/need at this moment? Kids are amazing. They don't need much encouragement to totally transform them. Mate even just a genuine smile can do wonders.

Edit: By the way, you are a legend for doing this. "
"wait, wasn't Sarah the one who set you guys up on a date? While she was dating him all along? Why would she do that?

These people sound strange OP. If you love the coffee shop that much, by all means - but I wouldn't be attending their family christmases and being all buddy buddy.

Anyway, highly anticipated update! Thanks for sharing!"
"I bet you $100 that he feels so horribly guilty for the injury **he caused** your daughter that he's avoiding it by displacing it all on you. 

Does he do this often? Couples counseling, stat."
"Just a thought. Could it be possible was upset he found out through an online post? Maybe he wouldn’t be so upset if say you had called him and said blah blah blah I found this amazing deal, I’m going to have a mechanic look at it but I think I found my dream car! In my opinion I think it comes down to communication. You saved your money and you bought your dream car so that shouldn’t be an issue. Congrats on your dream car by the way that’s exciting. "
I'm a gamer. Been a gamer for years. Have a nearly 3 year old. Gaming is for when the kid is asleep and the day is done... Going while crying?! Hell no! 
"Nope, if she can't afford it she can't afford it. She should ask the fitness center to pay for it. "
"Growing up one of our neighbors was killed by a drunk driver around New Years, t-boned by a truck. He had 2 little kids that my siblings and I played with every day. His wife was a stay-at-home mom. In 24 hours their lives were shattered and I remember them eating dinner at our house for the next week or so and the mom sobbing on our couch every night while my mom comforted her.

The guy that killed the dad was some 20-something drunk guy who was driving home from a party, just the most typical DUI accident you can think of. I don't know what happened to that family now but I remember the mom updating my mom years later saying that the guy got off on minimal charges because he made the case that he was ""young"" and it was just a ""one-time mistake"" so he didn't deserve harsh sentencing.

I have 0 doubt that that man's family consoled him just like your gf's family is consoling her now. I have no doubt that HE believed it wasn't 100% his fault either because ""mistakes happen."" But I have seen the effects of drunk driving on real people and it is beyond devastating. Real people with real families get hurt, all because someone is too lazy, too dumb, and too selfish to be a responsible human.

Your gf was lucky that no one got hurt, but it's disgusting to me that she's already writing off feelings of guilt after TWO WEEKS. The LEAST you can do after driving drunk is feel guilty. That's the most minimal punishment. You can decide if this is acceptable behavior for you. Driving drunk is bad enough, but how she's acting in response is childish, irresponsible, and not a great sign of her character. Personally I can never date someone I don't respect. And I wouldn't be able to respect someone like her."
"Congrats on your pregnancy! 

You might find some good techniques on dealing with your mother and her obvious lying issues on r/justnomil"
Wow why does a married man needs dating apps for? 
"Man, you sound really supportive and understanding. He's lucky to have you."
"Yeah his problem isn’t that he oversleeps, it’s that when it comes to you he just can’t be bothered. You said he makes it to his 8:30 shifts on time. The only reason he can’t do the same with you is because you’re not important enough to him to get up. If you’ve had this conversation a million times then it’s time to follow through and end it. "
"I had an ex like this. He was quite well-off and was always buying me things, which might sound nice except they always felt like gifts for someone else. He bought me this orange and pink coach scarf once and kept commenting I never wore it. Well, I don't wear bright oranges/pinks ever and I don't care about brands and especially don't like logos on my clothes. I still don't get how he didn't notice that in the year we dated, other than he did know and just wanted me to dress fancier.

I actually am really big on gift giving. I like doing it and I like receiving gifts. However, it's not because I like getting things or having expensive stuff bought for me. I like seeing the neat things someone might think I like or that I might need. I'd rather  $10 costume jewelry that suited me over something that costs $1,000 that is not my style because that would mean the person didn't take the time to think about me or know me well enough to understand what I like. 

Some people think it's rude and ungrateful to not enjoy every single gift you are given, but I actually think it's a lot ruder to constantly give gifts to someone that aren't suited to them. It just feels like they wish you were a different person or like they don't give a shit. I'd rather get nothing at all.

So, I feel you OP."
"&gt; So I had to insist I didn’t care and thought the whole thing was funny and wouldn’t mind watching the tape at Xmas,

Well, if you lie about your feelings, bad shit happens. Tell her the truth (and I'd take the tape)."
"Could he be seeing someone else on the side? He’s been distant, went a long time without sex after you gave birth. He picked a fight after being away with you. If he wanted to see his side chick, blowing up at you over absolutely nothing (you were playfully flirting, his blowup was absolutely absurd) then storming off for a few days gives him the opportunity to see her. Just a thought, "
"You go to the party. You laugh. You smile. You have fun. Flirt with the guy you’re bringing. When midnight comes, give him a sweet kiss. 

Forget about homeboy and his date. Be polite if you see one another, but at this point, you both have different dates. Don’t let him spoil your day. "
"Have you noticed that he isn't actually sharing expenses but just using you? How many times have you helped yourself to his belongings (let me guess, none?). He just so happened to not bring his own wallet/cash to grocery shopping so you should pay for it?

Get real. This dude is a loser and trying to leech off you. Tell him to keep his hands off your stuff and start planning to move out asap. You don't even know if he gave the landlord your money. He is not your friend. "
"Whether he's getting cold feet or not, he has made it clear that his aspirations are more important than yours.  So what that you graduated from law school?  So what that you passed the bar?  So what that you found a great job that you are successful at and are paid a great wage?  He doesn't care.  He doesn't value you or your accomplishments.  You can go peddle law in whatever country he ends up with while you support him.  His dream is all that matters.  I really don't see how he can come back from that.  He thinks so little of you and your future."
"So it seems like Sarah is a piece of shit too if I’m reading correctly? She tried to set you up with someone while she was dating him (?), she knew you liked him and things were moving fast, AND she was already in a 10 year relationship with someone else. 

Not saying you need to cut her off, but I think it would be beneficial to expand your friend circle and meet new people. "
"Stepping back from the current situation, how is it that you’re so unsure of your own judgement, OP? Based on what happened, I’m really surprised that you would think your husband could possibly be in the right. 

Does he undermine your confidence in your judgement at other times?"
"She got off on the idea that she landed a guy 20 years younger than her who could land a girl in her 20s. She also got off on being chosen over the younger girl, because it ""proves"" she's still young/hot/fun. That's why she pushed OP to date him. She's immature and tbh, OP should drop her partner a line and tell her about the cheating before disappearing from this shitty neighborhood full of absolute creeps. And OP, reassess your people picker, because it's broken. Every single comment told you to avoid this guy and you DATED him for months. What the fuck possessed you to think that was a good idea? You know what I say when I'm drunk? ""Honestly most Don Bluth movies are trash but I love The Secret of Nymh and I'll fight you over it."" Drunk is not an excuse for behaviour that scares you."
"He's never exploded at me like this. This is my question: is it fair at this point to say ""counseling or divorce""? I don't know if he'd do counseling since he won't talk to me"
The only real comment needed. His response will tell her everything. If it's the truth he'll know if it's a lie he'll deflect or get mad at her.
"&gt;he’s told me before that I’m the only good thing in his life.

Because he's not trying to create other good things in his life. "
“Something he’ll regret”? That sounds like a threat. Why on earth is he threatening his wife and the mother of his baby? Something is very wrong. 
"Your fiancé is totally unrealistic.   

You can’t leave your job on a lark

He can go to the other country — see what happens. 


I would rethink the wedding.   Do you really want someone who has so little respect for you and what you do. 
"
THANK YOU! Playing professional sports is hard and frankly he’s not good enough to make it. I supported him emotionally and financially while he played abroad last time. I don’t know where he thinks the money will come from this time around if I’m not working. 
"Honestly, I'm upset enough right now about being left alone that I don't think I can sweep this under the rug, so yes, I'm prepared for a divorce"
"Just FYI, I think you might have accidentally used Sarah’s real name in the paragraph where she revealed their relationship to you! 

Sorry this happened, though. It sounds like you might be better off avoiding all of them for a little bit, and maybe start branching out to meet people elsewhere. They all sound a little nutty to be honest. Best of luck! "
"&gt;This is my question: is it fair at this point to say ""counseling or divorce""?

that's a tricky question. Are you fully prepared to accept it if he comes back to you wanting a divorce? if not, don't throw it out there."
"Talk to your daughter privately.  Explain to your daughter that manipulation is not the way to build a healthy partnership.

If your MIL makes these comments in public, say something.  ""MIL, men don't like it when women manipulate them with tears.  Open communication is far better than using crocodile tears."""
"Your sister attempted suicide. I’d bounce on my own *wedding* if it meant saving my sibling from death. 

Your boyfriend’s disappointment I understand, but frankly, *you* are not the person he should be taking it out on. This is a “vent to a friend or therapist” situation, not a “punish your already-beleaguered girlfriend for events outside her control” situation. If this is out-of-character for him, give him a day to cool off and then sit him down and tell him the wedding is being postponed until you work through this. If it’s IN character, and he has a history of punishing you and expecting you to manage his emotions for him, then this wedding needs to be called off entirely. "
"&gt;he made a comment that it didn't look the way he pictured it and then he got sulky. 

This is the dealbreaker for me. Sounds like he likes his idea of you better than who you are as a person. Find someone who likes you for you."
"He hasn’t spent it on anything you’ve noticed, meaning it wasn’t spent on the family or he is still hiding it.

Either way, I highly recommend marriage counseling. He shouldn’t feel compelled to hide such a big thing from you."
"A nice meal, attention, activity like decorating cookies or making a card for his mom or caretaker. He will enjoy being away from the ""home"". You don't  have to do too much otherwise you could overwhelm him. Take a photo if you can and get it to him later.

I have been a mentor to a teen. I do not recommend taking a 10 year old shopping. It's overly stimulating."
"Agreed. This is a huge red flag, OP. The first and only thing out of his mouth should have been something like ""Oh, dear God. I'm so sorry. What can I do to help?"". His complete lack of empathy here and his selfishness are going to bite you if you marry him. "
I would tell your parents because you want to get ahead of her on any stories she might tell about your boyfriend propositioning *her* or any other variation she might come up with. 
"Hijacking to say: It's okay to be disappointed that things don't go as planned, but it's not okay to break down and add more drama.

It'd be different if op's fiance went ""When you can, let's plan something to make up for this"" since Christmas is important to him. But throwing a temper tantrum loses any right to sympathy for him.

/u/Emergencyproblem \- heavily consider if this is behavior if you want to put up with. I know th at this sub is trigger happy with the break up gun, but to be fair ... it gets lots of situations like this."
"It seems to boil down to three things:

1.  How important is a sexually fulfilling relationship to you?
2.  Would you be fulfilled having sex with women who will never be your primary partner (assuming you can find one or more who are happy to be a side-girlfriend/FWB/one-off)?
3.  Will there be any negative impact on your children and how they view relationships?

Your maturity in handling this is admirable.  But, make sure you're being honest with yourself at every step going forward.  Your instinct will be to protect your wife and your children; but you also need to protect yourself."
Going to a house party and getting wasted was more important to her than visiting you.   Take that however you want.
"Awww, that's super sweet. So glad he stepped up to the plate this year.

Some people aren't gift givers (see the five love languages concept)."
"Wow, that's super out of line to leave your wife and infant daughter for two days to ""cool down.""  Time for that kind of teen-aged drama and antics has come and gone.

Have you asked him how long he plans on being gone?  Did he elaborate on what it is he may do that he might regret?  Has he indicated anything that might lead him to have this kind of a childish and irresponsible reaction (leaving your wife and infant for two days with no contact is very irresponsible)?

Maybe because of my age and disposition in life, but I would tell him that at this point, before coming back he needs to answer these questions.  I'd personally want answers to those before letting anyone who had that kind of outburst around my child again.  Does ""doing something he might regret"" include violence or other abusive behaviors?  Cuz that sure seems like the implication?

That ""do something I might regret"" comment and angrily storming off for two days is not exactly the behavior of a mentally stable person.  Is he going through something he hasn't shared with you that he may need help with before being around you two again?"
"&gt;Did he even think of his kids?

I keep thinking the same thing. This is a crazy kind of liar."
I suggest you do not drink with your mother ever again. She is not a good person and she does abuse alcohol. Her behavior is way over the top inappropriate. Would you be able to live with your father if he is more stable than your mom?
"My guess is that on some level he knows it is mostly his fault, and can’t handle the guilt so he’s projecting it onto you. Be firm and tell him you won’t be paying the copay out of your personal account."
"Not fixable. And who knows what he might do if/when you really leave. Find a way to leave with your stuff etc without him around, and don’t break up with him in person. In most cases breaking up via text or call is not ok, but in situations like this it’s necessary for your safety. Don’t be alone with him anymore. If you meet up with him for anything only do it in public places. I’m sorry you’re going through this, stay safe. "
"Your mom feels threatened by your newfound independence and is looking for ways to remain in control.

If your move wasn't already finalized, I'd almost encourage you to find a new place entirely and not tell her where it is. But since it's a done deal, I'd start setting boundaries now: She never gets a key to your place, nor does she get to drop by unannounced. If there's an on-site manager, inform them ahead of time that she might try to weasel her way in (if you think that's a valid possibility). Do you have a job in your new town? If so, I'd warn them, too, in case she decides to ""just stop by"" while you're working.

Be prepared for the likelihood that she will flip. the. fuck. out. when she realizes you aren't just going to let her run roughshod over your adult life."
"In the MLB, there are 30 teams, each with a 25 man roster.  That is 750 men, on the entire planet.  About half of them are at replacement level.  Replacement level means that there is another guy in AAA ball that could come up replace anyone of those 375 with no significant increase or decrease in performance.  

At 28, he won’t get a look. He would have to have developed some serious improvement in skills to even get just a scout to take 5 minutes to see him.  No scout will travel across town to see him.  

I know this is harsh but it is reality.  Now, he is determined and that is one of the characteristics that make a person an excellent athlete.  There are times when we have to admit we are not what we had hoped.  This is likely his time. 

It’s good to have a dream but his time is past.  At this age, he is approaching the decline years. "
He’s projecting his guilt onto you. 
"Yeah, I'm a STEM person and I envy people who have a mind for subjects that aren't math and science-related. I think we overvalue STEM skills because they tend to lead to jobs that pay more, and that's a depressing metric; without literature, music, art, anthropology, sociology, etc. the world would be dull and one-dimensional. 

You two have a genuine connection. It isn't a contest of wits, it's a romantic relationship. You don't need to understand all the same subjects or concepts to love each other, have fun together, and enrich each others' lives."
"My husband and I both have PhD’s in engineering...in the same field of engineering, in fact. We went to the same colleges and got approximately the same grades. When he talks about what he does at work or does calculations in front of me, I often have absolutely no idea what it means. That’s not because we have drastically different levels of intelligence; that’s *specialization*. His job is different from mine, and we’ve spent time learning and perfecting our skills in different areas. The same goes for you and your boyfriend! You likely are a better writer than him! Getting a paper published means you’re good at research, not necessarily writing, because you’re usually working with other people who can pick up the slack in that area. For example, I’m definitely a better writer than my husband, but he has more published papers, because his job focuses way more on research and publishing.

It might be helpful to see a therapist and explore why your self-esteem is so low. Your boyfriend sounds like a kind and thoughtful person, you should believe him when he says that you have your own skills and talents. "
If he was a great listener you wouldn’t be in the predicament you’re in right now swimming in fabric and gifts you don’t want. 
How about he supports your dream for once?
"Just be frank about it: “When partner and I were picking our wedding party we decided to include people who’ve been highly supportive of us and our relationship over the past few years. You and I haven’t had much communication recently, in fact you haven’t responded to many of my texts, so I assumed you weren’t interested in having a closer relationship with me and therefore wouldn’t want to be in my wedding party. I’m surprised, and pleased, to hear you are interested in having a closer relationship as your desire to be in the party would indicate. At this point the wedding party is set, of course, but if you are interested in us becoming closer I’m always happy to spend time working on that and our relationship.”

Obviously she won’t want to, but that way you’ve told her, in no uncertain terms why she isn’t included and made it clear (to her and your family if you say something similar to them) that you’re not trying to slight her in any way/ reject her as a person."
"I am a scuba instructor. Her instructor handled it properly by still swimming with her so she could look around. I bet this helped calm her down a lot so she may not be totally against trying again one day. 

It sounds like it was just a lot for her to take in, and it can be for some people if they have never dove before (this is why they have those introductory experiences!). Sometimes people need a few tries at it :) (and just as a quick PSA: you definitely don’t learn everything you need to know to scuba dive or be a scuba diver in a one-hourish class - you just learn the basics of what you need to know to do a scuba experience dive, under direct supervision).

There is nothing for either of you to feel bad about it here. You gave a thoughtful gift. Neither of you had any way of knowing she would react as she did. Her instructor took time with her. She seemed to be happy you were still getting to have a good time. And I don’t think just ignoring it is the answer either. 

She asked you how it was, I think just avoiding talking about it - thinking you are protecting her - is the wrong answer. If you thought it was cool, tell her, and heck maybe she will want to try again one day. Maybe you will want to take your training further. But just changing the subject and pitying your girlfriend is not the answer here either.  Its a bit infantilizing to be honest. It’s okay to enjoy things even if your partner did not (or could not) participate in them."
You say “he has a habit of using dating apps” like it’s the equivalent of using a horoscope app or something silly. Why are you not demanding the respect you deserve in this relationship? 
"Your dad didn't take care of you when you were still a minor, let you rely on non-family members for housing, and disowned you.  He can pack sand.

You've already told him you won't be going.  If he calls or messages again, don't respond."
"Nope. Do not do it. 

She needs to see a grief counselor or other mental health professional to help deal with the miscarriage. 

Edit: Tell her you care about her and you think she should seek help to deal with her grief. But, you are not ready to be a father. 

"
"calling off a wedding and losing deposits is easier and potentially cheaper than a divorce.

Let him go. And go enjoy the awesome party and food you paid for."
"If she didn't take the time and effort to find gifts she approves of, then it's not your responsibility to do it for her. In your own words, these are supposed to be things that you'll love and use. Now that she's given you the gift, it's yours to spend as you see fit. It sounds like you know what you need &amp; you'll use the money wisely. Go for it."
She’s an Excellent catch. 
"Don't do it. You are both way too young.

"1) You should definitely tell your friend. Hopefully this will encourage her to voice her concerns with his lack of recent motivation and fears of dependency to him, and if they are still able to work things out, it might at least put off his plan for a couple months or so, or until he finds something to do with himself. 

2) Even though you said you'd be happy to help, I think you should tell Jason that you would rather be left out of the proposal, and you can tell him the truth in that you don't want to invest in something you believe won't end positively, or you can just say something like you think it might mean more sincere if he does everything himself. Going back on something you'd say you'd help with is hard, though, so maybe you should try encouraging him to have a more private proposal. Jen seems like a very practical and straightforward woman, so it seems like whether she would say yes or no, that might be more her forte anyway. If it does go sour, a private proposal has a lot more room for reconciliation, so that might be your best bet in terms of his side of it."
"I think he’s proposing because he thinks a ring will get her to say yes to him moving to Canada and living with her (for free) while he waits on the visa. He knows she’s not happy. He’s probably doing it publicly to pressure her into saying yes.

If you were your friend, would you want to know this was coming? I sure would.

I would tell her. You’re probably saving her from an awful humiliating public moment — yeah he might be mad but you’re her friend, not his."

"Don’t give up your job.  Tell him that you are not going to torpedo your career and give up your job for an unattainable dream.  And if he still continues to push you, then postpone the wedding and go to couple’s counseling.

His delusion could very well ruin your earning potential in your career, and you never want to make yourself a dependent on someone who is not grounded in reality.  Let me be reiterate: **DO NOT GIVE UP YOUR JOB AND CAREER FOR THIS MAN.** 

I have to ask, is he normally controlling about other things in your lives ?  Is he threatened by your work and career ?  Have you had to compromise other things in your life to keep him happy ?"
"Here's a piece of knowledge to burn into your brain hole: most people probably don't give your life a second thought.

Sounds scary (and I sound like an asshole for saying it) but it's true. Most people won't even absorb that piece of information because they don't value it, even the people who care about you probably aren't worried about it or thinking about it, and here's why:

Most of these people won't see you again so it doesn't matter to them, nor should it to you. And the people who care for you, they see what you're describing to us - a happy couple who are in love and focusing on other priorities - and so they don't care either. The only person who really cares is you and that's who you need to be sorting this stuff out with. Good luck and happy holidays :) "

Chances are he will not. Chances are he will get frustrated with a three week old child screaming for something and go outside to ""cool down"". Chances are asking him to help with basic childcare will end with him saying ""You're nagging me again!""

When someone tells you who they are *listen to them the first time*. If he can't be depended on for a dog then I would have serious concerns about an *infant*."
"&gt;I think I'm going to ask his roommate to bring it or when I go back home I'm going to ""run by"" and grab it before I take him to work one last time while simultaneously dropping off the box on the way back.

Go to his apartment and get it with a friend - don't be alone with him.  If you can't think of anyone to go with, ask the police for someone to go with you to keep things civil.  

Don't give him a ride to work or do him any favors.

"&gt;I feel bad for being so materialistic and being upset over gifts, but I'm annoyed that he expects me to bend over backward to appreciate things that he knows I won't like. How do I handle this?

Honestly, you nailed it with this sentence. You aren't being materialistic; it's not like you're upset that you *didn't* get some other sort of item or gift that you wanted better. You're not expecting a particular item or gift. 

What you *are* expecting is that your partner attempts to give you gifts that reflect who you are, rather than who he is. This is fair. 

The solution to this is to communicate, but I strongly recommend doing it at later date that is after / before any gift-giving occasion. That way it doesn't happen in response to a particular gift, and he'll be less likely to be defensive. 

Explain to him that you do not have any expectations for the gifts that he gives you, but that this behavior;

&gt;Then he sulks if I am not appreciative enough. He was so pissed that I refused to wear the perfumes he bought me because they gave me a headache.

...is unacceptable, because it is (1) rude, (2) selfish, and (3) a form of manipulation known as *guilt-tripping*. Perfumes cause you physical pain; therefore, if he gets you perfume as a gift, he should not attempt to guilt-trip you into wearing it to soothe his ego. He should either get you something other than perfume, or not at all, or be OK with you not liking/using the perfume. With the other items, you've made your preferences on those sorts of subjects clear, and his disrespect of those preferences is inattentive at best and inconsiderate at worst. 

If his issue is that he doesn't know what to get you, a practical solution is for you to put a list together or give him some ideas to choose from. Gifts are a love language that you may not share, and what comes naturally to you...

&gt;The issue is that for every holiday and gift giving occasion, I put a lot of thought into a personal gift that I know my boyfriend will love 

...may not come so naturally to him. The charitable assumption is that your boyfriend is a bad gift-giver and defaults to things that he likes or that he thinks are conventional, not that he's trying to change or manipulate you with his gift. Meeting him in the middle may help. 
"

"&gt; My mom said that I should get used to him being this way or break up with him because at 6 months in, he’s made it clear that he’s not changing his ways no matter how many conversations we have.

Your mom is a smart woman. When you almost break up over something &amp; the other person STILL doesn’t change, then it’s not going to change ever. Your boyfriend has seen how deeply hurt you are by him sleeping through things that are important to you, but he hasn’t stopped doing it. So you either decide that this is a dealbreaker (my vote!) or you decide you can live your life planning all the events you expect your boyfriend to attend after the time he naturally wakes up on his days off. "
"&gt;I told him I get that we started as a casual BDSM encounter, but him using BDSM as a guise for his true aggression towards me was not ok (i.e. choking me out repeatedly without my express permission beforehand, usually so when he was frustrated with me). 

Yet another shitty fake Dom who doesn't understand the first thing about consent, and thinks BDSM is an excuse to abuse women. THe kink world is FULL of guys like this. I'm so sorry you had the misfortune of meeting him."
I second this. You’re sister tried to kill her self. He needs to man up and not be a whiny little child. Shit happens that you can’t plan for and you didn’t “ruin” anything. Instead of whining he should be asking if you are ok and if your sister and brother are ok. There is nothing you need to make up.

"There's no way to sugar coat it. Not only did he hide it from you, he lied about how he spent a chunk of it (if your hockey trip suspicion is true), and now he's playing dumb about where the rest went, or he's hiding some of it from you. 

I don't think all those lies are acceptable in any kind of relationship. And he's clearly prioritizing his relationship and fun with friends over his financial responsibilities as a husband and father. Anyone with young children who lives paycheck to paycheck should be very nervous unless they have significant emergency funds. He had a chance to save SOME of it, or pay down whatever bill to give you a bit more ease in your finances, and he chose to do otherwise. 

Sounds like you and your kids are not a priority to him, unfortunately. I'd suggest you start figuring out how to make your security a priority for you and your kids. You can't trust him, financially, so I'd no longer want to be on a joint bank account etc. Make sure you have an emergency fund of your own, in case you need it someday. Like for a divorce lawyer. "
"He's a manipulative asshole **who raped you**. Why do you want to get him back? Why do you trust him, when he clearly unworthy of it? Sorry to say it sounds like he was using you to get what he wanted, got it, and is now moving on. Sorry you've gone through this."
my ex did this. he didn't want to seem weak in front of his friends... but my male friend with their GF they are so open about how much they love their GFs and wives and when someone says shit the shut them down. LEAVE him. and if he was just trying to not look weak in front of his friends he just learned a life lesson. growth.
Let him break up with you so you can find someone who actually likes you.

You sound really done. Is the issue that you don't spend time together? Is the issue that you are working too much? That he is working too much? If you can afford a 40h week nanny, can you not afford an employee so that Husband can stop working more that 90m a day? "

Be wary of getting back with him. People will say whatever pretty words they think you want to hear, but rarely does anything ever actually change. "
"Hell no. If he has trouble with condoms then he should have been honest about it and looked for other options (i.e. different kinds of condoms, non penetrative sex).

It's not weird you didn't ""see the signs"" before this. THIS is the sign. It came up within a month of dating. That's very normal.

I would say that it's unusual to be blindsided by something like this after say, 8 months to a year of dating, and especially after living together.

"I agree with u/SinglePastryChefLife that your boyfriend likely had no idea what the reality of owning a puppy is. It’s one thing to think about those moments of your day where you’ll be focused on the puppy (feeding, going for walks, training, etc). But it’s another thing entirely to recognize that the puppy exists &amp; will make demands of your time &amp; attention 24/7. You don’t just have a happy little training session then the puppy powers down so you can focus on your own wants for the rest of the evening - the puppy is still there, needing to be supervised &amp; corrected. It can be hugely frustrating. 

What I think the bigger, underlying issue is here is that your boyfriend refuses to acknowledge the reality of the situation, which is that he’s not interested in doing the amount of work it actually takes to raise a puppy. It’s totally okay to be overwhelmed or at the end of your patience, but it’s another thing entirely to mentally check out &amp; pretend that’s not what you’re doing. My husband &amp; I have both needed to walk away from our dogs (REPEATEDLY) as puppies because sometimes we just lose composure &amp; can’t deal with it. But we do our best to communicate that &amp; to step back in to do our share of the work once we’ve calmed back down. So your boyfriend’s inability to acknowledge that he’s just completely checked out here is what I’d take the biggest issue with. "

She is both your daughter, her welfare is both your responsibility. Even if this was your fault (which it's not), this should be a joint account expense.

Tell him **once** that her medical expenses will be paid out of the joint account. If he refuses, pay it out of your own account (your daughter's care is a higher priority than money) and immediately look into separating. Also, write this incident down in as much detail as possible.

"I noticed you only posted this an hour ago, so I want you to read this very important piece while you still have time:

PACK YOUR BAGS! Get everything into as few bags as possible so that when he pulls into your driveway you can just throw them in the car and go.

[Edit, here's the rest]

In your boyfriend's shoes, I would do the exact same. If you tell me your dad is hitting you and you have no place to go or way to get there, the first thing I'm going to do is get in the car, especially if it's only an eight hour drive. There are more important things than hanging out with my parents on Christmas Eve, and it's not like you can't just move the actual celebration of Christmas over to the 26th if something major like this comes up.

&gt; I just feel so terrible that he is leaving his family behind because of me.

Please don't. You didn't ask him to do this; he volunteered. Hell, you told him *not* to. I guarantee he would feel like a total piece of shit if he didn't.  

&gt; I’m a little concerned it may color their opinion of me that I pulled their son away at this time of year.

Good people don't think this way. Imagine if you were his mom, wouldn't you want him to go? Even encourage it? *THIS* is what the holidays are about. Not useless displays of consumerism or white-bearded fat men in red suits. Helping each other. Spending time with people who actually enjoy your company. You know, like your boyfriend.

&gt; What do I do when he gets here, and almost inevitably gets into it with dad?

You don't. As soon as you can see his car coming down the road, you grab your stuff and go outside. As soon as it's parked, throw your bags in the trunk, jump in the passenger seat, and go. No words between them, it will get unnecessarily ugly.

&gt; What do I tell his family about why my panic response pulled their son away on Christmas Eve?

You tell them the truth. Nobody who is worth spending time with will be angry at you. They probably already know. Maybe tell them how much you appreciate that they raised a good kid, and that you feel welcome in their home.

&gt; And how do i make it up to my boyfriend for throwing a stupid wrench in all his plans today?

Again, this is only speculation, but I bet he'll tell you not to worry about it. This isn't something that needs paid back. I'd say get him a six pack of his favorite beer, but you're too young in the US. Something along those lines, you know? But don't feel obligated in any way.

This is nothing to feel bad about. Go have fun with your boyfriend and what I can only imagine to be his lovely family."

"It definitely gets easier to handle long work days over time as you get more experienced with handling a long work day, and also as you get more experienced in your work you will find the job itself less mentally taxing, but a few things come to mind:

I wasn't diligent enough, and didn't learn this until my landlord called me directly to say they hadn't received the last two rental payments from the other tenant (and this is also how I found out I was paying significantly more rent than I should have been).

Lots of women gain weight who were skinny their whole lives, men start to lose their hair, our faces start to fall and that beautiful thing of life experience starts to show around our eyes and foreheads. We stop getting carded for alcohol at the supermarket, we often become slightly invisible to those around us, we look like average middle aged people. This is especially hard for women who have always been attractive and no longer receive the attention and praise that was given so freely just 3-4 years ago.

Men go thru all of this as well. The pressures of demanding desk jobs start to show physically. I think this is more common then you are aware of because many men mask the insecurity, while women are more apt to speak freely of their desire to look younger.

You have tried re-assuring him, you have told him you love him just the way he is. This is now becoming an obsession and addiction. You need to treat it as such. 

If he continues this path he will never be fulfilled, there isn’t enough botox in the world to bring back your glory years. He needs professional help to be able to tackle his fears and insecurities. 

I also believe this is likely a manifestation of a larger fear or anxiety. That he’s physically seeing the signs of aging and is scared shit less about facing his own eventual demise and mortality. I could be wrong though.

Reach out to family and friends and share your concerns. It’s especially bothersome that he is using medication for alternative effects, not the intended and FDA approved usage. With his family history he could be at grave risk. Amongst the other side effects as well.

"
I had an ex who also had the habit of gifting me stuff that he found appealing. Always made me feel like he didn’t give a shit what I liked just that he wanted some idealized version that liked all the same things as him. Turns out that wasn’t gonna happen. He always *seemed* nice enough but at his core selfish as fuck. I didn’t put up with that shitty behavior and neither should you.
He feels guilty for hurting your daughter so he’s shifting the blame to you. Do not tolerate that. Do not apologize. It wasn’t your fault. 
"Thank you for your response. I should have mentioned this before - she HAS talked bluntly with him about her concerns. She made it very clear that she expects him to contribute to the relationship, and that if he moved to Canada he would have to have some kind of plan in place to get a work permit or go to school or work towards some kind of goal, and if he didn't at least try something she was ending the relationship. They've had two blow-out fights about it. Which is why I was so shocked when he still insisted on proposing. "
"She’s likely processing, my friend. It’s a big thing to tell someone, and I know I’d be taken aback myself. The absolute worst thing you can do right now is let your old life win. You *have* changed, you *won’t* relapse or go back. You are a better, stronger person than you were, with or without her in your life. 

If I were in her shoes, that is what I would want to see from you in order to move forward. 

From one recovering addict and person with a similar background to another, I feel your pain, and I’m sorry you’re going through this. I relapsed over the holidays and have told absolutely no one. It was a one time thing that served to strengthen my resolve in the long run, but the cravings get worse when you cater to them and now I have to practice extra vigilance, and I’m so disappointed in myself that it’s hard to look at my disappointment too closely. The disappointment is worse than anything else. I wish I had been as strong as you‘re being right now. 

Stay sober. I believe in you. Everything will work out the way it should. And the right person will see and love who you are *today*."
"Yup. The lie and the hiding are the issue here. I mean, the money would obviously have been nice, but the complete deception is the far bigger issue. 

I can see someone wanting to selfishly spend a windfall. But all of it? When you have little kids? Yikes. "
"&gt;she told a pretty big lie to an entire group of friends. This is really troubling.

Me too, OP! I'm not sure if Christmas/the wedding brought out a new side of your mom or not, but the way she is trying to bend you to her will by attempting to sabotage your reputation in circles by making up things like you tearing up a card is disturbing.

I'm so glad you have a father who is so loving and accepting and supportive. But I also worry he gets emotionally manipulated on the regular. Him getting to see you and your husband was the only peace he had that day! :( I wish you good vibes and congrats on the incoming bebbeh!"
"Yes she deserves to know. Yes you’re in the right informing her as you’re just as involved as she is. 

And break up with your girlfriend now. You’re too young to waste any more time on a bad relationship with a bad person"
"&gt;My question is this: should I throw away 14 years over this?

Absofuckinglutely. Into the trash they go. You're married to an abusive piece of shit and you deserve better. Most importantly, your kids deserve better than to grow up in a household where they see their deadbeat father abusing drugs and denigrating their mother."
"No thoughts on the relationship aspect but i worked in big law and left and had a very difficult time getting back in. You can obv get better advice on a legal job forum but understand that you might not get back in big law if you give it up now. If you are at a law firm you can stand, ride it out as long as possible. "
"I just want to second this. He is embarrassed he got caught red handed. Instead of apologizing, he decided to slung mud at you. 
Maybe you should bring the baby to your parents house for a few days. He is being a bully."
"He needs to stop answering these calls. They are not helping her. Your family needs to talk to a doctor about a professional care plan because Alzheimer's is not something you can ""wing,"" especially when none of you are trained to deal with it."
"Lots of comments here focusing on the drug dealing for the most part, but uh, hello, he hid this from you for years??? Absolute dealbreaker, in my opinion. Like, I do think that weed should be at least decriminalized, but the fact is that he lied about a big part of his life that also happens to be criminal behavior. And amphetamines are majorly not cool. Can you continue to be with someone who lied to you so massively?

Edit: the people who replied to my comment about amphetamines have been voted down, but they were right about me being a bit mistaken -- Adderall, for instance, is an amphetamine. I was thinking of \*meth\*amphetamines. But the rest of my comment stands."
Absolutely not dude. She has no business dating a teenager in the first place. You need to tell her that you're not going to be willing to get married or have kids for a while. You need to be set in your career/education before you think of having a baby. 
"Is the person he’s taking a friend that he made plans with before he started dating you or is she a real date?  

If she’s genuinely a friend, you need to chill out.  It’s one night.  It actually speaks well of him if he didn’t back out of a commitment he made prior to meeting you.  If he told you about this early I don’t see how you were “blindsided.”

If she’s a real date then forget about this guy.  If he wants to date you and others and you want to be exclusive, you’re just going to be miserable.  "
"&gt;My boyfriend wants to break up with me

He can break up for any reason he wants.  You need to let him go.

&gt;He feels frustrated because he just wants to do what he wants to do 100% of the time, and he doesn't want us both to compromise or settle.

This isn't a good trait for a partner to have.  You will be dodging a bullet by ending this relationship.

&gt;He also said that during sex he wants to just receive a bj and not give anything in return

Dodging another bullet here.


Let him be selfish.  Go find yourself a guy who wants to be with you.  There are absolutely guys out there who will compromise with you.   Don't get hung up on this particular guy who won't compromise."
"This is my guess as well. He found out about the car the same time the rest of the world did - on Instagram. Imagine mindlessly scrolling through your feed then suddenly learning of some big news about your boyfriend from there.

If you two are very close and as serious as you say, I can definitely understand why he might feel blindsided. In a serious relationship, one doesn't want to feel like everyone else and get big news about their partner from social media posts. "
"Tell him it's time for couple's counseling or the marriage is in deep trouble. Don't BS it, lay it out clearly and concisely. He doesn't take care of his child when he says he will, he needs to stop lying and try to fix this issue. 

You need rest, if you can I'd consider leaving for a while, stay with someone else and recover some sleep. He needs to get his head together. "
"&gt;Short of telling Laura to fuck off and break up with her fiancé and date Kevin herself if he’s so great, I’m not sure what to do. 

If she keeps pushing it, I would basically say *exactly* that without the curse words:

""Laura, we are just WAY too different, it would never have worked. Kevin's mom isn't upset about this so I'm really not sure why you're so perturbed. I hope you can let this go and be professional.""

or something. honestly, she seems like a *nightmare* - is she going to make your working life hell after this, no matter what you do, do you think?"
"Sarah is an asshole and a cheater. Derek is unhinged and a cheater. Seriously, girl, he makes me nervous. OP, why do you want either of these people?! Forget the coffee shop if you have to. Move on from these people. They're not good for you."
No. Nobody told you about it which means they clearly did not care enough about your presence in the first place. Don't drive 5 hours round trip on Christmas Day to appease people who couldn't be bothered to make plans like functional adults. Do whatever you originally planned for Christmas and spend it with your husband. 
"  I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you should absolutely get a divorce. You can remain close friends, raise your kids peacefully, etc. but you can't be together. Your wife is gay and needs a shot at experiencing real, complete, romantic and sexual love with another woman. Likewise, you need to have a shot at experiencing the same with a straight woman.

What you are describing cannot and will not work. You aren't idiots for wanting it to work, because it's comfortable, familiar, and you do love each other in a way, but you both need to live your lives fully and honestly, and you can't do that as a gay woman married to a straight man."
"You’re not a bad person, but he can divorce this toxic woman and still maintain a relationship with his child. "
"Oh hell no. I've been in his shoes before in a different 'dream' career (professional ballet), but when I realized that I was not going to be the next superstar, I got to work on plan B.

Here's a thought: postpone the wedding, tell him that this is his final chance, and let him go alone without your financial support. Hopefully he will come to his senses, but if he doesn't... this is not the guy you should marry. 

**EDIT** Something to suggest to him... maybe he needs to search for a new direction for his ambition. When you've gotten so close to your dream, it's hard to settle for a boring job. But the plus side is, the people I know like him have a great work ethic and can really excel if they point that energy and enthusiasm in a new direction. My friends from ballet training are now lawyers, physical therapists, pharmacists, economists, etc. "
"I was in a similar situation years ago. Here's what he eventually said to me: ""bringing food is what a wife would do, you're not my wife, stop acting like you're my wife."" This was not him saying ""wait until we're married to bring food to my family"" this was him saying ""I have no intention of being with you long term in that way, stop playing like this is ever going to be a thing, you're just what I'm spending time doing at the moment until something better comes along"". 

No matter either way, because if your guy is, as you say in comments, calling you stupid on the daily - break up with him. Have some self respect. "
"Tell her. ""Hey I wanted to stay out of this, but I've been involved in helping plan a public surprise proposal for you for several months now. I do not want to ruin the surprise so I've been torn what to say, but hopefully you take this as helpful and not a dampener on your fun. I notice you've been having trouble lately and as your friend, I really wouldn't want to see you in an awkward spot, so I'm giving you a heads up so I feel like I've been a good friend. If you don't want this, please take this chance to have a frank conversation. If you do want this, then forget I said anything at all, and I will keep supporting this fun plan, which I won't reveal any more details about at all."""
"There’s definitely a rite of passage in your early 20s for many people when parents go from seeing you as a kid to seeing you as an adult. 

It sounds like you handled this in a super mature and adult way. "
"It doesn't seem productive to blame anyone for what happened. I would prefer if we just paid the cost jointly and moved on, rather than accusing him of anything if that makes sense"
"&gt; “Yeah sorry but that's crap. I get you like me, but at the end of the day you are 32 not 17. And the whole ""I just lose myself and can't make a rational decision"" is bullshit. You know what you're doing, I've made myself extremely clear so there's no reason that shouldn't have been your priority last night. And IF you really are just ""losing yourself in the moment"" then fuck that too, because I'm not risking myself or my boundaries just because you get caught up in sex.”

YES GIRL! Your response is PHENOMENAL! You should be insanely proud for standing up for yourself and holding your boundaries. You were clear, and he disrespected your boundaries TWICE. You definitely made the right decision!"
"My bet is he had run up credit cards secretly, and just paid them off.  It's something he wouldn't want to tell, leaves enough to pay for a hockey game, and unnoticeable to her."
"&gt; What could he have have spent it on that you wouldn't notice? 

Yeah. 35k is a lot of people's yearly salary. It is not something you spend in 8 months without someone noticing. That's at the very least 4k a month.  "
"Please make sure you're taking care of yourself and that your needs are being met. I've been in a relationship like this for 11 years and it hasn't gotten better. There have been glimmers of improvement, but ultimately he's ""alive"" but absolutely without life. He has no friends, no goals, no real interest in anything but games.

I'm very sorry you're going through this. I have so so much empathy for you. Over the years I've grown resentful for all of the time I have lost. It would be nice to chat and share care techniques and communication tips."
"Hate to do the age thing...but not really. Because there is a big difference at 19 and 32 and men his age who go for women your age aren’t doing it because they are looking for an equal, mutually respectful, and loving partnership. 

He is trying to manipulate you because he believes he *can*. He is making you think *you* did something wrong when you did not. 

Show him he can’t manipulate you and let him stay gone.

ETA: Oh and jeez, serves me right for not finishing your entire post: you stopped the consent of a sexual act and he continued - don’t lie to yourself he just did not hear you. He knew. He continued anyway. That is rape. He raped you. 

It is perfectly normal for both people
in a relationship to participate in birth control and safe sex, and to expect the other to participate in that. Now he thinks he can manipulate you into sex acts you are not comfortable with to “earn” the trust he is holding over your head as “lost”. One thing if you are into it but you do not have to participate in a rape fantasy to “win his trust”. He is being so gross. 

And again, he raped you."
"&gt;I'm casually on Tinder for the time being to talk to people

This isn't a great idea. You need time to yourself. If you want to talk to people, go to a chat room or find a facebook group with people who have similar interests as you do. Tinder is a cesspool of grossness and you are not likely to find the conversations you desire there. Tinder is for people who are trying to find hookups. Most people on there don't care about conversation and just want sex. I'd be happy to talk to you if you want someone to talk to. I've been through my share of shitty and abusive relationships. 

I think you could definitely benefit from talking to a therapist or counselor, and definitely you need to spend some time figuring yourself out. What do you like, who do you like, what do you want, where do you want to be? Answer some fundamental questions about yourself before you get into another relationship. "
"Honestly drunk driving is an absolute deal breaker for me. 

Her family trying to tell her she shouldn't be embarrassed because ""everyone has been there"" . . . Are you fucking kidding me? No. No not everyone has been there because most of us know the very very serious consequences of drunk driving so we act like damn adults and have a DD or call a cab. 

Plus, it doesn't even sound like you're hounding her on this. You're driving her places and trying to be supportive. You're just also not trying to tell her what she did wasn't all that bad. You're letting her feel her (well deserved) guilt and shame. 

So yeah. This is huge red flag. You can love and be supportive of someone without enabling their shit decisions. "
"No matter what you do, NEVER sweep the silent treatment, or abandonment under the rug. And he has done the unthinkable here.  I don't know how in the world you could ever trust him again. "
This man blamed you for his cheating. Run!!!
"I mean... if he has to literally move countries so he can ""make it"", he knows he's not good enough to truly make it as a baseball player. You were supportive of his dream twice already, and he's being incredibly selfish and a bit naive to think you can just ""take off a couple of years"" to follow him and wait until he's done with his dream. That's not how it works and you should absolutely not support this. 

If he's threatening to go, then let him go lmao. But make it clear that you won't wait for him nor change your life so he can follow a dream that will ultimately not happen. "
"This is dumping territory for me. You may think they're untrue, but that is how he veiws you. Do you really want to stick around with that?"
"No, no, no!!!!

If you get her pregnant, you will be responsible for paying child support for at least 18 years.  You will have to deal with child custody and visitation, etc...

Basically, if you get her pregnant, you could fuck over your life for longer than you've already been alive.

My recommendation would be to not have sex at all with a young woman who has told you she wants to get pregnant.  Yes, you could have sex and insist on using a condom, but a woman who really wants to get pregnant might be tempted to put holes in the condoms or scoop semen out of a used condom.  It's far safer to not have sex with her.

Ultimately, you are responsible for your reproductive decisions.  Are you ready to house, feed, and care for a child? Are you ready to change diapers, take care of a sick baby, and work to pay bills? Do you WANT to be a father?  If most of the answers to these questions is ""No"", then you need to always insist on using a condom. "
This. Her entire career is like an afterthought to him. It sounds like he only pretends to give a shit.
"Either a house meeting, or an email. ASAP.

""Roommate, I just needed to make a few things clear, since I think we've been operating on different assumptions, and I want to make sure we're on the same page going forward.

1.  We do not share any finances, expenses, income, or money. Rent is split 50 / 50. You pay your 50% directly to the landlord by the 1st of every month, and I pay my 50% directly to the landlord by the 1st of every month. 
 
2.  We each buy our own food and groceries, and that food is not for sharing. You spend your money on your food, which I will not touch, and I will spend my money on my food and groceries, which you will not touch.  
 
3.  These utilities are included in the rent: heat, water, and garbage. Electricity is not. Provided there are no space heaters, A/C units, or electricity-heavy electronics, we split the electric bill 50/50, due on the 15th of the month. Your 50% gets mailed directly to Utility Co, and mine does too. 
 
I'll supply cleaning products and toilet paper for my bathroom, you can supply it for yours. ""


 None of us like difficult and awkward conversations. No one likes conflict. But if you have a roommate, there is no way to avoid difficult or awkward conversations. You're just going to have to suck it up and do it.
"
"Why is she working so much? Debts? General cost of living?

I'll tell you a story about this guy I work with. He used to work 6 or 7 days a week, and some of the days he was at work for fifteen hours. Basically because he had no life outside of work and was (sadly still is) obsessed with earning and saving as much money as possible.

You know what happened after a few months of this? On one of his all too rare days off, he had a stroke. 35 years old, and he had a fucking stroke.

So yeah, you're right, she is being reckless. But is she acting like this because she is heavily in debt or has other money issues, or for another reason? 

"
She sounds like she likes to be chased...also sounds like an asshole
Don’t look at it as throwing away 14 years when you could be saving the next 40 from misery
"Not only is he in the wrong for jumping out at you, blaming you rather than just writing it off as an accident is doubly bad. And making it your financial responsibility?! Is this typical of him, splitting things off into separate responsibilities rather than you both acting as a team?

That said, you need to stand up for yourself! Your husband ""told you"" to hold you daughter? ""No, she's getting too big for me"", end of story. Which **doesn't** make this your fault, it's 100% him for causing the accident. My point is it seems like part of a pattern - he tells you what to do, and you feel like you have to do it. You ask him to stop guilting you about it, and he doesn't. You ""want to tell him no"", but you're...what, afraid of his response? What will he do apart from disagree with you? You don't ""have"" to do a damn thing - he should be wanting you to work this out together, not being so domineering, and you need to fight your corner, not roll over."
"What ate you supposed to do?  Why would you need anyone's help?  You aren't a helpless child.   (And this ""you can't do this to us""....  Wtf.   Stand up for yourself, don't act like a helpless Disney princess).   

What you do is remove yourself and your bf from any situation that includes her.  If anyone asks you tell the truth.  ""She came on to my bf when she was drunk and I have zero interest in being around her""."

"I would absolutely encourage you guys to get into couples counseling and even individual counseling. You are entering unknown territory and it's a tricky situation, especially with kids involved, so I think it would be extremely beneficial to have a knowledgeable professional help you guys through this process. You may also want to post this somewhere like /r/lgbt, they may have more experience with this kind of situation. "
"The bigger problem is going to be that you've been telling them for months that you haven't been seeing anyone. Does your girlfriend know that you are lying about her to your parents? As for your parents, you are basically saying ""I was lying about dating someone because I think you are judgemental."" 


Tell your parents you are dating someone you'd like them to meet. Tell them that you really care about her. Tell them that she is white so that they can decide how to act around her and not just have a visceral reaction.


But, if you are just going to lie about your girlfriend and not have her be part of your life, then go let her find someone who doesn't feel like they have to hide her."
"If his concern is that it could trigger his own eating disorder, that is legitimate.  He has to put his own health and recovery first, just like you do.  This is one of the reasons that people with the same disorders often can't have successful relationships as you can get into a spiral of triggers.

You need to be able to be healthy with or without him.  It is probably time to stop sharing food, manage your own diet, and ask him to stop commenting if he can't be positive."

"I think it’s always tough to see your SO’s ex, especially when it was not planned! And I think that normal jealousy is being amplified by your difficulties with other women.

Schedule an extra session with your therapist. Tell your BF to be gentle with you because you’re feeling sensitive about his ex. And make yourself busy doing something you love (hobbies, hanging out with friends, whatever). The bad feelings will fade with time."
"This feeling is in your head; believe him when he says you're glorifying his intelligence. He may be super smart, but you're not dumb and you're clearly up to snuff as a companion. If he doesn't think he's ""too smart"" for you, then he's not; you're the only one who thinks that. "
"&gt; I also know that I should be grateful for any gift and shouldn’t have certain expectations.

I mean... The idea behind being grateful for any gift is that gift giving shouldn't be about materialism, but about showing appreciation for someone through getting them a symbol of that appreciation. So no, you shouldn't be grateful for a shitty gift from someone who a) should know you better than anyone, b) whom you spoke to about this very thing recently because it has been a problem in your relationship historically. Shitty gifts are only acceptable from acquaintances, workplace white elephant arrangements, and people who don't like you. "
If you've seen him hurt her you should report it. Reach out and ask her what she wants to do. Let her know you will help her leave if she wants to. Other than that there's unfortunately not a lot you can do.

Tell him to either respect the person you are or go date the person he wants. 
"He thinks the proposal is going to change things. She might end up thinking that proposing means he is going to get his shit together. I can't read either of their minds, but people do tend to place a whole lot of faith in the transformative powers of engagement/marriage/having a kid, etc.

I would stay out of it. Decline to help, make whatever excuse you want. I'm torn on whether you should tell your friend what's going on. If you do, the bf will stop trusting you, and depending on how the relationship goes, that could eventually negatively impact your relationship with Jen. 

edit: one thing you could try is asking him whether he has already talked to her about getting married and say you don't think anyone should propose unless they have already talked over marriage. Then say you will be happy to help him with a proposal after they've talked about marriage and decided it's something they want, and you will know if this happens bc you are friends with Jen, but that you don't feel good about helping when they haven't had this conversation."
"I second this. OP, you and your SO shouldn’t be beating yourself up over this because, in the end, you guys did all the best you could: for her, she tried out a new thing that she has never done before, and for you, you articulated a really special birthday present and executed it out yourself, something tbh many of us have only dreamed of doing.

With you being a new diver too, there isn’t much you could do differently: 1) if you stop the dive for her, as you stated, she would definitely feel worse for “ruining it for both”; 2) you could not have been there with her because being a new diver yourself, you would need to be with your instructor for safety, and she should too. So by choosing to keep going like you did, you did the experience for her too and you could tell her about it, it isn’t like you’re bragging at all.

Tbh, if it is me in your position I would feel terrible too, but since I am an outsider I tell you this: feeling worse is not for the better of things. It is better to let this slide because, sometimes mishaps happen and it is not worth to keep going back to them.

I don’t know about your SO, but may I bet that she is really eager to show you the pictures she took, of her BF who is able to scuba and get to see all the cool things underwater, and it is something not many people could perform but her BF can!

Edit: sorry I hijacked your top comment, OP of top comment! If you want, I’d move my text wall to a separate place"

"You’ve gotta let it go. I’ve been your girlfriend, except with a caving/spelunking tour and it was our honeymoon not my birthday. I was totally not upset at all when I bailed, I was relieved I wouldn’t have to go further. I was psyched he got to do it and really wanted to hear all about it. I took pictures while I could still see them and totally would have waved.

I understand when people are young they make mistakes but OPs gf not taking responsibility for her actions and showing remorse is not acceptable in my opinion. She is lucky no one was injured. "
"Am I the only one who thinks you haven't had a abnormally high number of partners? You've been sexually active for 8 years, and with 20 partners that's an average of 2.5 partners a year. That seems pretty reasonable to me. As long as everything was consensual between you and your partners I see no issues here. "
Pretty sure this is the issue right here. 
"I was in the same exact predicament. I was married for 13 years, together for 17.  I worried about what she would do, like harm herself because of mental health issues. Eventually though, you cannot live your life trying to make someone else happy, or stay with someone because you feel sorry for them. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do this, and it's going to be extremely difficult for a long while. You just have to rip off the band-aid and do what your heart tells you to do. He will live, and you both will move on to the next chapter in your lives.   "
"&gt; He didn't come out until later that night, and instantly went off about how I had ruined the holidays for us.

Did he even know your sister survived and was sent home? Because from the sounds of it he was more than willing to scream at you for caring about your sister? Is that really okay with you, to be with someone who will treat you like this for trying to help your family?"
"Stop involving his mother in the case you need to build against him. If both of her kids are that fucked up, I wouldn't trust her with a dry paper bag. She won't be on your side. I mean, this?

&gt; she was respectful for the most part but did pull a sneaky trick on me once by inviting him to our family vacation and not telling me

She will NOT be on your side."
"Basically I met him when I was 19 and he was 27. I was in college to become an archeologist and he said I didn’t need school to do that. And he said once his app of a game he was making was on iOS that he could pay for me to fund digs and basically do whatever I wanted. 

Being doe eyed and molested and beaten my whole life, finally some dude was nice to me and saying yes we can make your dreams happen, just seemed like an answer to prayers. 

The catch was I needed to become fully devoted to him cut off all ties with everyone and have no income and just be his muse and support him fully. 

Welp now I’m 27. He’s currently in japan. He lied and said he got a job at a video game company but it was a lie to get his family to loan him the money to stay there. It’s his 5th alone trip to japan this year. he’s just fucking off there for 7 weeks while I pack up all my shit and get out of our house before he gets home and continues to manipulate me. 

I’ve worked now full time for several years... he’s hasn’t worked at all “just working on his app”

I’m done done done done doneeeee"
"OP seriously, after all the good advice people gave you in your last post, you still continue to make excuses for people who DO NOT have your best interests at heart.

We already told you that Sarah didn't seem to have your best interests at heart when she made excuses for Derek's behaviour, calling him a ""good boy"" even after you told her how deranged he acted during and after your ""date"". 

Also the fact that she pushed you into seeing him was a bad thing itself. She should never have pressured you like that when you were new there and relying on her judgment. Especially since he was an unemployed 31 year old in the first place!

Honestly I still think you're a little clueless for dismissing Sarah's part in all of this. Seriously, re-read both your posts and imagine if a friend of yours had written it all instead. What would you say to her?

Don't trust random people in a foreign country, male or female, young or old, to have your best interests at heart. You need to learn to trust yourself and your instincts. 

If you didn't already do so (and I bet you didn't, because you never would have given Derek a second chance if you had), please read *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker. "
"I think the issue is simply that he didn’t find out directly from you. Nothing to stop you after making the purchase from sending him a celebratory text or giving him a quick call before you made a post for everyone. It’s inconsiderate to let your serious partner learn about major financial investments via social media. Beyond that, it just sounds like the two of you need to work on your communication and he needs to hear you out that there is a hurtful message in how he has viewed your decision-making process. "
You’re a great girlfriend OP. He’s lucky to have you there for him. Just try to make sure you don’t put too much stress on yourself.
"&gt;Her behavior is way over the top inappropriate.

Like, she literally sexually assaulted someone. Her own fucking child at that. "
"Very surprised by these other comments. This is absolutely a deal breaker if you decide it is, and I personally think you're being 100% logical. Sex is a *major* component in most romantic relationships, and not being able to decide if you're compatible in that respect before making a huge commitment like marriage is insane unless both parties have strong religious/moral reasons. (And even then, a lot of those marriages don't work because both partners stuck to their morals but are now dealing with the realities of shitty intimacy.) 

Your boyfriend has already had the opportunity to sleep around and now he's decided he wants to wait. That's great for him, but what about you? You have no idea what you like or dislike in bed, what your boyfriend is going to be like, if your libidos are well matched, you already know you want to experience sex before marriage so you know what/who you're getting into... and with him he's pretty much stated that's going to be impossible. 

Your boyfriend is being very shortsighted, but hey, it's his prerogative. And it's your prerogative to tell him that's not going to work for you and move on. I would do that in your position, as would the vast majority of other people, despite what's being said here. 

You're also young; now is the time to explore your sexuality (whether in a monogamous relationship or not), and not figuratively lock yourself in a cage for the sake of one guy. There will be many others out there who have equally great personalities but will be happy to explore sex with you. "
I feel like this is the most charitable version of events that has a chance of being true. 
"Congrats on both the pregnancy and the new shiny spine!

You and your husband (and your dad) did good against a full on toxic manipulation stunt with Christmas bells on. 

People in the original post suggested subs here you'll find useful but I think with a baby on the way you're going to need a bit more crazy-proofing. 

I don't want to armchair diagnose but I do get a strong Cluster B personality disorder whiff from your mom so I suggest you order a copy of 'Will I Ever Be Good Enough?' by Karyl McBride about the daughters of narcissist moms and also grab Shannon Thomas's book 'Healing From Hidden Abuse'. Both are about ten bucks each on Amazon and worth as much as a some professional therapy if not more if your therapist doesn't understand crazy making moms.

The best way to proof your new family against your mom is to understand that she wants a reaction more than a relationship and she will do anything for it. You will never understand why she chases that reuplsive high of attention and drama so much because you are not wired that way and would not treat your kid or anyone else like that. 

The fact you don't understand her is what will ultimately proof you against her as long as you set your boundaries and stick to them. This may be very low contact, leaving the room when acts up, going full no contact or whatever works for you. That's a personal choice you make for you as one size does not fit all.

But be aware that she's likely to 'repent' when she finds out about the grandkid so she lulls you into a false sense of security where you tell yourself that she'll be different with junior because you want to believe your mom isn't toxic and you didn't suffer her shit yourself. 

And this is where you might need therapy as well as simply toxic proofing, you did suffer and she won't be different with your kid. She'll just use your baby as her newest source of drama and control because a person who treats their own child the way she has clearly treated you all your life isn't going to treat any other tiny baby better. People of any age are just objects for her unquenchable thirst for attention.

And any time you try to tell yourself she'll be different this time I suggest you listen to the song 'The Snake' by Al Wilson and remind yourself predators cannot turn cuddly.

I have a mother like yours and for me therapy, educating myself on Cluster B personality disorders and full estrangement was the only way to go. Cutting her off was the easiest bit though because the lack of drama was so restful. It was working through my childhood and dealing with the 'but faaaaaaaamily' folk that was hard. Both absolutely worth it though.

Good luck!

"Hello!  I'm a lawyer, specializing in family law, (as well as a divorcee) and I just wanted to offer some words of encouragement.  

Divorce is hard and scary for numerous reasons.  You flip your life upside down and feel like you've failed or that it's embarrassing.  When resources like money, mortgages, assets are involved, it's easy to get really frightened of how everything is going to shake out.  Add in a spouse that's a sovereign citizen (which, speaking to numerous judges, is the most annoying people we get in court.  Not that it ever helps them) AND an alcoholic/alcohol dependent, and it's a one way ticket to Stressed-as-Fuck town.

First things first, get a lawyer.  Tell them your husband is a sovereign citizen (bonus points if they grimace hearing that) and an alcoholic who has passed out while alone with the baby on at least one occasion.  Explain everything as you have here, including your concerns.  Explain the financial situation too.

Your attorney will likely tell you this: you need to start documenting EVERYTHING.  If your husband sent you texts talking about getting drunk or how he's drinking while watching the baby, then screenshot those!  If he sends you texts showing he's a sovereign citizen or hates the government and believe it has no right to control his drinking (and his brother's drug use) document that!  Be able to show any criminal history background. 

Also be prepared with your financial information in case your lovely husband decides the government can't stop him from grabbing all the money from your bank once you tell him about the divorce.  Knowing exactly how much is in there will be helpful if he empties the accounts and tries to run or just leave you all with nothing.  A short word to the magistrate/judge will fix that if he tries it (here's hoping he won't, but such things have happened before).

From there, you will want to navigate through custody and parenting agreements.  I'm not sure which state you're in, but different judges and magistrates can either be unbiased or biased to giving more time to mom over dad or vice versa.  Your attorney will be familiar with the judges and magistrates and be able to tailor their strategy to that.

Frankly, with the alcohol dependency, the issues with leaving him alone with baby, etc., your attorney will probably find they have more wiggle room to press for full custody or primary custody for you.  A family court will look at the best interests of the child and that will mean looking over the differences between you and your husband.  Living spaces, parenting styles, how you behave as a parent and as a person, etc.  It can feel very, very stressful, but it's very worth it for your child's welfare.

Finally, my last word of advice is that one you split, get a regular ole calendar from anywhere.  Mark the custody agreement days on the calendar.  If your ex fails to show up, mark that day with a red Dot and also write in his excuse why (or if he gave no excuse at all).  If he's late or delayed or difficult, mark it with a yellow dot along with his excuse or describing his behavior.  If you mark a day with a green dot, it'll mean everything went smoothly.  If you ever have custody disagreements in the future, you can have contemporaneous proof of his behavior throughout the child's life.

Hopefully, you'll get supervised visitation for him so that any drinking or ""passing out"" with your child is noted by the person supervising.  

As for child support, that is covered by a mathematical formula and not an arbitrary amount.  The judge will issue that and he WILL need to pay or else be found in contempt of court or have wages garnished.

This is a general overview and not terribly specific, but I often find people get some comfort of knowing what to expect when faced with the unexpected.  I do believe that you're a strong, capable mother and that you'll do everything to keep your child safe.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to PM me.  But, like I said, please get a family law attorney that is in your state (preferably your town for connections) and begin the process sooner rather than later."
"&gt;he wrote it out of anger and was trying to get himself to break up with me by writing it

Sis if he was trying to get himself to break up with you then do yourself a favour and dump him. Don't see why it's worth saving when he isn't willing to actively communicate and work on the relationship but will write a rather hurtful list on what he dislikes about you as grounds to break up rather than grounds to improve. 

Furthermore, if there's any truth to what he says, then maybe you should spend a bit of time working on yourself without someone who seems to be making things worse for you and is unwilling to communicate with you and support you. 

Ps. I have a list about my SO, that I look at when I feel like things are difficult between us, it lists everything I like/ love about them. Because I want it to work. "
"Thank you for the response. You're probably right. My dad lives in his girlfriend's house, they are very welcoming and she doesn't mind if I stay there a few days but I'm not sure if I could move there. It's a possibility I guess."
"This is the real point and something of a taboo - money is power.  That a 35 year old man, who is living hand-to-mouth could blow 35K in 8 months without his wife knowing... For me that would simply be a deal breaker in the relationship.  I couldn't be with someone who got handed a life changing sum like that and pissed it away with nothing to show for it without consulting me in the process."
"Even worse, she caught him on dating apps, and *she* ended up being the one to apologize, for “peeking”!

OP’s normality meter is wildly out of whack here."
Buying a house together while unmarried is a bad idea. Hop on over to the personal finance sub to read why.
"This is incredible, and so selfless of you!! 

The kid is probably a bit anxious if he is already shy. Maybe take him to a bookstore and let him pick a nice book to read or, as a previous poster mentioned, a good nature walk. You two could collect things like a cool leaf, or rock, or twig and help him make a treasure box of collected items!"
"Yeah he's scum. He could buy nappies, food, school supplies, clothing, sporting lessons etc. Or even invest in their future by opening bank accounts for them. "
"your twin... who is related to you... hence the title of “twin”... as in sibling... I’m not saying incest doesn’t exist but if that’s the first thing your girlfriend jumps to when she hears your sibling has seen things most people haven’t, then ... "
Seriously. He can get his bank statements and show you exactly where it went. 
"&gt;The last incident of abuse was just under 6 months ago.

Your dad has not changed in a mere six months. He's still the same abuser who has spent decades abusing you and is 100% responsible for your mental health issues.

Your focus right now needs to be on self-care and healing. Having him in your life absolutely prevents you from doing that. 

You can forgive him (if it's helpful and useful to you), but that does NOT mean that you have to have a relationship with him. He's forfeited that right by abusing you as a child.

The best way that your dad can **fix things**, if he truly cares about you, is to respect your desire to not have him in your life so that you can heal from your trauma. 

But trust me, that will be insufficient for him because he still puts his needs above yours."
"It can also make his goal overcoming the ""I'm not comfortable"" part, instead of the ""everything separate"" part.

"
Ok if it's not normally like this why are you afraid to say no? Why are you not sure how he would react?
"You’re at the age where people go from partying  constantly to sorta growing up and not doing that as much. Nate could have changed without you and Jay would still be mad. You’re just around when it happens so he’s placing blame on you.

I dunno what to do about it. Maybe get Nate to sit down and have a real conversation with Jay about how he’s treating you."
"Dude, you can do so much better than this person. 

- He’s been lying to you for years

- He didn’t warn you ahead of time

- He won’t admit you’re dating 

- His family is full of assholes

- He lets his family be assholes to you

- He won’t discuss what you experienced and how it made you feel

You are going to have to continue to deal with this as long as you date him, so I would highly recommend ending the relationship now. "
"So. He wanted this to be perfect and when it wasn’t, he overreacted in an extreme way and blamed you. This is a giant red flag, because it shows how he acts when things don’t go his way. Give the ring back, and tell him he can give it to you after he gets anger management counselling. "
"&gt; Each year there is TONS of food (always brought by the older adults, the parents and grandparents, never by the 20something year olds like us)

It might just be one of those unspoken family tradition that the older folks bring the food. 

Still, you deserve to know the exact reason why he refuses to let you bring food over."
Break up with her and formally evict her. Do whatever you'd like with the TVs. I am appalled at her behavior. I'm sorry for your loss OP.
"&gt;This has led to SEVERAL fights with my gf where she calls me ungrateful, selfish, and unempathetic to real victims. ...My gf then sides with her and comes home to berate me on how selfish and ungrateful I am.

This is unacceptable.   There is no future for you with this woman.    She doesn't respect your feelings, she's too busy prioritizing what she thinks she knows about a situation that she has never actually lived.    

You can't move ahead with this woman -- she empathizes with your abuser rather than you, her boyfriend.  There's no compassion and support for you there, just a lot of hurt.   Get out of this now.
"
"THIS. Don’t back down.
None of us can help you. The only think that can solve this is you insisting on discussion. "
[deleted]
She screws around with other people's feelings because she's bored. That's a bad person. Don't date a bad person. 
"It means that he knows that he is the one who messed up. He grabbed you from behind, and if he hadn't done that, your daughter would not have been hurt. You were holding your daughter just fine. He's the one that caused you to drop her. It's his fault.

However, he can't bear it. He can't bear the thought of it being his fault. His ego is extremely fragile, and if he thinks for a single second that his actions resulted in your daughter getting hurt, he will feel so ashamed that it will tear him apart. Unfortunately, that shame is what we call consequences. Just like if your daughter puts her hand in the cookie jar, and you walk in on her and scold her, she's going to feel ashamed because she broke the rules, and she knows she did the wrong thing. That shame is how we know we do something wrong, it's the consequence that we learn from so that we don't repeat our mistakes.

But your husband won't accept the shame in the consequences, he's deflecting it on to you. If he can convince you that it's your fault, then he doesn't have to feel ashamed. He gets to feel like he's right and you're wrong, so he doesn't have to learn anything. He gets to feel good and smug, and unfortunately, the only thing he learns from this is that you're easy to manipulate, and he doesn't have to face consequences for his actions. Those aren't good lessons for him to learn. He needs to fully take responsibility and accountability for the actions that led up to your daughter hurting her wrist. If he can't or won't do that, then he is letting his ego guide him, and that's not healthy for your marriage, or his parenting."
Badly executed excuse to see the other woman for new year? I hope this isn't the case OP. He sounds immature either way. 
"Yeah, he’s not alone today."
"Do yourself a favor and do not just wait a few weeks to tell your family you're pregnant, wait longer. If possible, get the excitement and enjoyment of revealing your pregnancy to friends (who do not know your parents) whenever you get that itch.

You don't know how this pregnancy will make you feel yet (sick, fatigued, moody, etc.), so just spare yourself the effort of having to deal with your mother for as long as you can."
"For a couple that's living paycheck to paycheck like she said, it can be life-changing. Removing debt, having a buffer to get a college or technical degree to start a career, 35k buys a lot of buffer room."
"""I'll stop smoking weed if you stop using your wheelchair""

I don't know why you've been listening to this guy. Your health is much more important than his uneducated ignorant opinion. You're taking xanax for a medical reason that was prescribed to you by a medical professional. The reasons you two are taking those drugs are completely different. I would leave him and live an even better life. You won't have to worry about him doing ecstasy then! "
"GOOD FOR YOU.

&gt; If I ever feel like my boundaries are ignored, or I’m disrespected like that again, we’re done.

He ignored your boundaries. STAY STRONG."
"Doesn't matter if she's your mom, doesn't matter that she was drunk - she assaulted you. This isn't okay, and I'm so sorry you went through that."
"I’d actually trust your sister’s instincts here. 

I’d focus on pulling this woman aside whenever you get the chance and telling her that you do not support how your brother treats her. If you can follow through on it, offer to help her find (and fund) an immigration lawyer so she can figure out how to leave your brother without running afoul of immigration laws. 

I’d normally advise her not to trust the family members of her abuser, but if she’s alone in this country, she may not have a choice. If you and your sister can be her support system, please do it. So many women end up trapped with no one to turn to in situations like this. And if he treats her poorly in *front* of you, I guarantee he’s much worse behind closed doors. It would be a net positive for humanity if you’re able and willing to help her. "

"He wanted to have sex with someone else, he dumped you so he wouldn't feel ""guilty"". Now hes realizing that dating and trying to have sex with these women isnt as easy as he thought and so he wants you back. Dont take him back, he sucks."
"6 months in, doesn't prioritize you at all, doesn't care about hurting your feelings or things that are important to you. Your mom is right on the money. "
"I actually have a surprisingly relevent story for this. I took theatre in highschool for my mandatory art credit. I don't love theatre or being on stage. When I was 14, one of our class projects was to make a short drama film, and I tragically had to act the bad writing of a bunch of 14 year olds who are all in pharmaceuticals now. The difference between your story and mine is that YouTube existed, and our camera guy (who pushed for this project) fancied himself a real star and uploaded this video he is never in to YouTube and Facebook. I only used social media between the ages of 17-21 to keep up with things related to my university, so I never even knew that was the case until my first friend at university, about 2 weeks into knowing each other, said ""I deep creeped you and found that school video you were in."" **I was mortified.** I mean, God, first it's poorly written, second I hunched my shoulders and dragged my feet the whole time, third I didn't even want that video to exist in the first place! I reported it and got it removed from Facebook, but who knows if it's actually gone from the internet now. The thing is, since the dawn of YouTube and social media, we don't really get to live anything down, we don't get to reinvent ourselves, we are stuck starting at that awkward kid forever and we have to come to terms with it... But we don't ever have to watch it with an audience.

Throughout your post, I see - and excuse my bluntness - the common *man* problem of you not being able to confront, talk about, or deal with your feelings. That's a problem that can (and kind of IS) eating you from the inside out. First, don't lie about your feelings. At all. Not even to spare someone's feelings. Most of the time, that doesn't even work: if I ask you if my cake sucks, it's because deep down I know it sucks. You're putting a bandaid on things, except that bandaid is just packing tape. Second, stop beating yourself up over teenaged awkwardness. Literally every teenager was an awkward mess in some shape or form. Think about all the YouTubers who started their career as teenagers and have to live on as adults in the awkward legacy of their teenaged selves. I assure you, none of them were cool and none of them are deluded about that now. If you didn't know at 14 that you were awkward, it's probably because people liked you. The person you are now isn't a sham, it's an evolution. Blastoise isn't secretly Squirtle deep down, and Squirtle always had the potential to become Blastoise. You either are or will be a bigass turtle with guns, bro, so be proud of yourself. Third, start acknowledging, accepting, and validating your own feelings: ""mom, that video makes me feel bad and I don't ever want to watch it again."" I imagine you're not suddenly going to start finding it funny, and you don't have to be able to laugh at this, but you do have to be able to live it down. Living it down does not include sneaking around to destroy it. Living it down means accepting that you were awkward, that that kid will always be part of you, but he's *not you anymore* and he's certainly not even most of who you are nearly 20 years later.

Your therapist has likely had you talk about worst case scenarios, so what's the worst case scenario if your wife sees this video? If you immediately thought divorce, loss of attraction, etc. then your wife is either a stone cold jerk or you've made a mountain out of a pimple. Would your opinion of your wife change if you saw an awkward video of her from 20 years ago? Would you love her any less?

It's completely valid that you don't want to see this video and you don't want it laughed at, but you do need to come to terms with who you are/were and stop hurting yourself over it. So what if you were awkward? Even if you were the most awkward 14 year old to have ever existed... So what? Accept and detach your self-esteem from a 20 year old video, please. You don't want to be one of those guys who is always stuck in his past, doing things just to impress his old school bullies and ""the one who got away because she was like 13."" We ask have versions of ourselves we don't like, so just be glad yours isn't on YouTube for all your new friends and co-workers to find when they Google your name.

**Edit:** Oh wow, thank you guys for the silver and gold! I'm absolutely elated that I could say something that effected even one person in a positive way. My face is using water gun.

Edit 2: removed misleading revenant typo"
You cannot date somebody's potential.
"Just to be clear he chooses to spend that much time working - it's not necessary. And a lot of ""work"" time is spent watching youtube, reading the newspaper, taking a leisurely approach to spending time in the office and ""working"". I get that people can't be productive 100% of their work time - I goof off too. That's part of why I limit work to 8 hours a day: there are diminishing returns. Point is he doesn't want to do anything else. He says he does, but his actions belie this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely angry. 34 is not a great time to be starting over if that is what it's coming to. I have sacrificed professional opportunities to make my family work, and I have always been clear as to what I want. My husband has changed, and I feel angry at him and at myself for failing to know this would happen. I'm not looking forward to being a single mother in her mid 30s and I'm not looking forward to staying in this marriage, so I'm not thrilled at my options.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes I am angry that a partner who wanted a kid does not want to get up with that kid or contribute equally to kid's care. I have some of the downsides of single parenting (not all...) and feel resentful that I don't have the full 100% control of my kid that a single parent would actually have. Feels like worst of both worlds. I lack the freedom to determine the future of me and my kid but also lack the help I expect from an equal marriage."
Honour your dad by giving the TVs away. Honour yourself by giving her away 
"I married a guy like this. I was with him 8 years, pissed away my 20s with him. I'm 34 now.

We are now divorced 2 years and i have to say, i am so much happier. And lighter, i lost 80 lbs plus his dead weight.

He had depression and anger issues. He was unstable a lot of the time and also has moments where i thought he'd kill himself. 

Honestly, you are not his everything, and he is manipulating you into thinking that so its harder to leave. If you were his everything, he would have stepped up and grown with you, in order to keep you HAPPY, not just keep you. 

Make a plan on how to leave, get your finances and housing in order then just rip off the band aid. Life is too short to live it for someone else's feelings. "
"Exactly, no apologizing. It is okay to be disappointed but her sister could’ve literally passed away and he’s moping around like a 2 year old. Also, is everyone missing the fact that he wasn’t there for his new wife while she was going through this?"
"Yeah, he's never going to go pro. Don't let him sink what you've built because he can't do the same with himself. It time to stop beating around the bush. Tell him he's being unreasonable. You've supported him twice now with his ""career"". You've not once gotten the same, and now he expected you to give up all that you've built because he wants to take another swing (Pun intended). I would postpone any marriage if this is going to be how he acts. He needs to adjust his goals and do something else, or do something more involved in the community. He will never get in professional baseball at this rate. "
"&gt;then he added, “There’s no one else that loves you more than I do”. And that’s when I realized it was a jab at me. I asked “What do u mean”, he further explained that I have no one else but him...

What the fuck.. how does one turn a declaration of love into a *power play*?.. He’s a twisted fucker..

OP, you need to start building social ties and friendships outside of this relationship. 

* You have a child — take kiddo to the park and start socializing with the other SAHMs in the area. 

* Or look on Meetups dot com for “mommy and me” playgroups to join.

* Start spending at least 2 hours a day outside of the house. Go on walks with kiddo. Heck, buy a cup of coffee at a coffee shop/diner/fast food place and sit inside to drink it. That will kill some time and it will have a bathroom you can change your LO’s diaper if needed. *Start talking to the other people you see.* A friendly old woman. Other mom’s with one kiddo. Single people sitting alone who are people watching. The goal is to flex your muscle at socializing so you become more at ease with it.

Start thinking long term of how you will separate from your fucked up husband. How much money will you need? Etc. Mentally prepare yourself and bide you time until you’re able to leave this jerk for good."
"Are you sure she isn’t depressed and maybe having some extended post partum depression? If she is so defensive about her job, maybe it’s because it’s her outlet to feeling herself without being a mom. "
"Take them both at their word. There was a used condom on the floor, the brother indicated it was from a sexual encounter with you. You have no memory of this sexual encounter and did not instigate it. I'd file a police report for sexual assault/rape. Let him explain his way out of it. Keep the condom if it hasn't already been disposed of."
"I feel like you need to talk to her and stop shutting it down.

If I panicked like she did I would at the very least want to know what it was like and hope my boyfriend enjoyed it as much as possible. It would make me feel bad if you didn’t.

So, talk to her and stop avoiding it, then ask her if she’d like to try something else, smaller, together. Take the pressure off and do something to start learning diving (or something else) together.

It’s sweet that you’re concerned and upset but talk to her about it, you can figure out a “do over” plan together"
"I feel like your average high schooler wouldn’t notice the expensive fabric of your sweater, so I wouldn’t worry. Cashmere is amazing and soft and warm and you should totally wear them. If you’re really uncomfortable maybe wear a scarf with them or something so it’s not the star of the outfit."
"&gt;He had been talking about wanting to get speakers for the tv recently. I started to feel like he bought the sound bar because he wanted it and said it was my present as an excuse.

He absolutely did this.  You guys sat down and discussed what to get each other for gifts and he completely ignored that to get something that he can benefit from.

&gt;He explained that he got it so we could listen to music together like we used to in our old house.

This is manipulation.  He wants to make you feel guilty so that you will stop pointing out that he bought a gift for himself.   That way he gets to continue to forget your birthday and continue to buy gifts that are more for him than you.  He knows he can just yell at you and call you a bad person and get you to stop questioning him.   

Does he do this in other areas of the relationship?   What happens when the two of you fight about other issues?"
"Being a victim does not absolve you from causing pain to others. It does not mean you can't be an abuser yourself. Victimhood is not sin-free.

Your girlfriend is actively denying your experience as an abuse victim, despite her so called ""compassion."" This usually isn't the logic of a person with healthy boundaries. It rings of someone who is also an abuser, frankly, and her behavior is indicative of that. I would strongly reconsider being with her based on this."
Your boyfriend is the d*ck and I rate him a 0.  Why on earth would you want to keep dating someone who is so mean and shames you for your past?  
"I genuinely can't think of anything not relationship-kryptonite-ish that he could have done with it, as he's apparently got nothing to show for all his spending. No material goods or vanished debts or increased levels of fine dining, so what did it buy? Personally, I'm thinking gambling, whether conventionally or through the stock market. Or there are the cliche options- a second family, a serious drug addiction or a particular fondness for sex workers."
"I agree with other commenters that she's probably asexual, but I wanted to add: If she doesn't enjoy sex and is just waiting for it to be over, *stop having sex with her.* Even if she says she's okay having the kind of sex you are now, if she's just doing it to make you happy and would prefer not to, that's horribly unhealthy for both of you, but honestly could be traumatizing for her without either of you realizing it. If both members of a sexual experience aren't *actively and enthusiastically enjoying* what's happening, especially on a regular basis, they should NOT be having sex."
Thanks. Thank you. Yeah. I won’t be doing so. 
"I second activities. Especially stuff like decorating cookies, a gingerbread house, etc. Most kids might reject the idea if you ask them directly because they think they’re “too old” for it, but will totally enjoy it once you start. Make some hot cocoa and play board games together, or if you have a gaming system play something two-player that you can both enjoy (Mario kart, smash, etc). Just hang out with the kid and I’m sure it’ll be a great time. Plus lots of snacks (especially anything more junk food like that he doesn’t normally get) will be a hit. "
"Leave the job, and don’t ever make such a colossal mistake again. And stop mistaking everything he’s doing for some meaningful sign. 

I’m embarrassed for you. "
Derek wasn’t playing both of them. Sarah and Derek were playing OP. 
There really isn’t anything to make better? There is no need to apologize to each other. Hopefully you still can celebrate some other small way
"Dude, no. No, you cannot be friends with a woman who refuses to meet your girlfriend. No, no, no. Red flag city."
"Hi there!

Tell her you loved her wedding speech but you hate the video and you can't stand the thought of watching it with people or having your wife see it.

Do not destroy it - at 90 you may find it is the most beautiful gift.

Don't suck it up either though - just say."
"A responsible partner and father would at least tell his life partner, the mother of his kids, that they came into some money. He could have invested it for the future - kids' college fund, or just emergency funds. Instead he spent it on...what, exactly? What the hell could possibly have burned through more cash than many people's annual salary, in the space of 8 months? Seems like pure insanity to me, and this would be a divorce-worthy issue for me if my partner didn't come clean. I can't understand married couples with kids who maintain totally separate finances, but I guess that's just not the way I was raised."
"He told her he loved her. Called her pet names. Met up for mini dates. That’s an emotional affair. If one had been braver than the other then it would have been physical. It was that close. 

You are the person to get him through hard days at work. Not blame you on top of never communicating. 

If you did that to him what would his reaction be?

I’m sorry but this a big big red flag. What happens when another cute girl gives him attention and he’s bored or lonely or you guys recently fought? "
"My periods are crazy unpredictable and I'll think it's over and nothing for 3+ days and then BOOM

Elevator scene from The Shining 

I 1000% would've been very embarrassed to sleep at a boyfriend's parent's house on my period at her age. Because ""what if they don't have a trashcan in the bathroom? What if someone sees the trash? What if I bleed through my pajamas? Or my pants? Oh god what if his dad sees my tampon in the trash????"" 

Most of that embarrassment and anxiety has eased up as I've gotten older, but 20 year old me would've been an anxious wreck about this. 

Try to reassure her but understand it just might take some time. In an ideal world none of this would be an issue. But there's still a lot of period shame and misinformation and nonsense out there. "
"I have a bald spot that I can't see in the mirror and I found out about it abruptly one day. I did that sulking and stuff too.  He's kinda in shock right now and he's processing being a fat dude.

Just be there for him and listen.  He has to self motivate if he's ever going to stop being an absolute unit. "
"Once resentment creeps in it’s very hard to turn that around. First off (and this is first hand experience) never have sex when you don’t want to. It only breeds resentment. If he can’t understand that then look for a partner that does. 
Yes this will continue to impact your sex life but maybe he’s just not the one "
"Yeah they all sound pretty toxic and insane. Not sure on the dynamics of Sarah's 10-year relationship with her girlfriend, but why is she dating a regular at her coffee shop while simultaneously trying to set him up with other regulars?!?! I'm really confused on all of this, but I 100% believe OP would be better off without any of them in her life."
"I think the only way you will be able to start this relationship is very specific calculated gestures of kindness. You need to pay a lot of attention to what he likes and try to make the extra effort to do nice things that he will really appreciate. Maybe learn to make dinner for the two of you once in a while, or see if there’s another chore that he could use help with around the house. Try to think about what exactly his interests are and show openness to them (wether it’s a video game, tv show, etc) suggest you’d like to watch/play it with him and then hopefully you can have a discussion around a topic he will like. "
"This is a much better situation than I expected to read when I saw the subject line! First, you are very fortunate to have such a great bf.  Please don’t worry about him or his family; do not feel guilty.  Second, be ready to run out the door as soon as he arrives.  This will head off a confrontation.  Don’t give it time for him to interact with your dad.  BE READY.

Explain to his family that you didn’t mean for your bf to drive to get you, and tell them they have a wonderful son.  Parents love to hear this stuff.  (I have kids myself.) Be as helpful as possible while you are there.  Show them you appreciate their hospitality. Tell them your family is difficult and you had not intended to get into it with them, but your dad has anger management issues.  Be tactful — don’t provide a lot of detail or talk about his getting drunk. 

Try to enjoy the holidays, and be as loving, unselfish and kind to your bf as he deserves! "
"Hi there!

Well done!

I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Let her process it.

You were adult and polite about it.

Well done."
"*Four times* the legal limit, and her take on it is, “well. shit happens, and it’s your fault I feel bad”?

Nah, that’s a giant fucking red flag. A red flag so big that Stalin would be all, “nah, that is too goddamn much red.”

I mean, when/if she ever gets her license back and gets another car, her insurance rate is going to be absolutely through the goddamn roof. Add that in to a family that apparently enables the shit out of being a drunk asshole, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. 

Dump her alky ass, and find someone whose idea of a good time doesn’t involve driving drunk. "
"Are you in the US? If she is worried about what leaving him could do to her visa status, there are protections for people who are in abusive relationships/situations. As others have said, it seems like he may well be abusive emotionally and physically. Maybe you could do a little research on the protections and let her know about this? I don't think he's going to improve himself if he went to the all trouble of finding a wife in a foreign country who will just do what he wants, instead of becoming a better person. So it may be her best bet to leave him.

Edited to add: Links are not allowed on this subreddit so Google ""us visa status abusive relationship"" and the results from uscis.gov should get you started."
"YUP. Pay your landlord directly. Tell him you already paid your half to the landlord, so he's now paid up for two months. If he complains, say he should have asked you first."
"&gt; She got off on the idea that she landed a guy 20 years younger than her who could land a girl in her 20s. She also got off on being chosen over the younger girl, because it ""proves"" she's still young/hot/fun.

Yeah, that might be it. I was also thinking if maybe she pushed her at him to test him. Either way, gross, disgusting attempt to use a naive 20 something girl for a dumb reason. And OP spent Christmas with them."
"I think he's mad that you didn't even call him and say, ""Hey I just saw my dream car and I'm buying it tomorrow!"" Instead, he had to find out the same way some strangers did, in a social media post. That tells him you don't think enough of him as a partner to share something so important with him. "
This is true. Care comes first. Gaming should not be his priority.
"Youre way too old to be letting your parents make your decisions for you. “Dont ask permission just ask forgiveness”. If you made plans with your boyfriend, you should stick with them. Flying in the rain isnt dangerous or scary, if it were dangerous they would cancel your flight. Just tell your parents that youre going and its not a question. Then go, and enjoy time with your boyfriend. Im younger than you and ive travelled around the world by myself. It is not dangerous or scary. My mother also has a lot of anxiety and i told her “too late i already bought the plane ticket” and then i ubered to the airport and i went and had a great time. Honestly i can see your boyfriend getting very resentful of you always doing what your parents say instead of making the effort to see him cause that seems disrespectful to him. You need to be able to stand up for yourself. Its not like youre driving into a tornado. "
"""Okay, bye.""

This isn't excessive partying, this isn't new behavior. He just wants to control you. He can love you as you are or walk."
She's in for a rude awakening. You can move on with a clear conscience and be very glad you're not in her shoes. 
"My husband did this when we were dating and in he early years of our marriage.  So and so gets their nails done and they look nice.  You should have nails like hers.  So and so has long hair, you should grow yours out.  Dresses, skirts, makeup.  He wanted someone I'm not.  So I told him if he likes it so much why doesn't he go date that person.  We sat down and I told him flatly that if who I am is not what he needs then we can split up.  I have my reasons for not wearing makeup, or getting my hair or nails done.  I dress nicely and most importantly, comfortably.  I don't dictate his appearance because as long as he's hygienic and happy, I don't care.  I'd much rather have a kind and loving partner than someone that puts more stock into what they look like on the outside.  

Don't let his insecurities become yours.  Be open and talk about it.  Use I statements.  I feel uncomfortable.  I feel unappreciated and unheard.  I feel that the changes you want to see in me will never happen because that's not who I am.  I feel disrespected.

"
"Is he a trained medical professional? Are you taking drugs prescribed to you by a medical professional in the prescribed doses?

If the answers are ""no"" and ""yes,"" then fuck him. You have to make your mental health a priority.

---

What you have here is a conflict of morals/values. He doesn't believe in psychiatric medication. You clearly need just that. He is welcome to his beliefs, but he does not get to tell you what to believe.

On of the most important life lessons is that you should never sacrifice your values for an SO. Sure they can change over time as you learn and grow, but they need to be yours, not someone else's. Always. If he doesn't like the values you hold, he shouldn't be trying to change you. He should break up with you.

You attempted suicide 3 times while with this man. Please read that again. Now one more time. And again.

3 times.

That is not healthy.

This is not the right relationship for you.

---

Going off Xanax should not be negotiable. End of story.

What you need is to keep on going to a good psychiatrist and follow his/her directions.

What you don't need is a man in your life who does not take your mental health seriously."
You can’t be serious. You really are not sure what you should do here? Your husband is horrible. Your life sounds horrible. What are you clinging to?  
"Listen, I get it. Sometimes we spiral and feel like it’s better to just die than go through it all again. But you should realize, if you choose to break up with him over this (I personally would) that it is to improve your life, not to end it. You are making progress. If you choose not to, your other option is to try to find a different sleep aid. That way you give up what he asked you to, but find something else to help. Either option sounds like an improvement. However, if you choose to find a different sleep aid, you’re still dating someone who’s beliefs do not personally align with yours. If you have to check yourself into a hospital to prevent yourself from suicide, then do it. You need to find a life worth living on your own, and this person doesn’t seem to be the fit. "
Lollll respond in three hours saying you slept in. 
"I don't know if anyone had brought this idea up yet, but some people dont understand that working from home still means you actually have to work. Sometimes it can be downplayed in their head and pushed aside as if it's that much easier. 

I don't think you're overreacting. Taking care of a child is in fact a job in itself, hence nannies and other child caring careers. 

Don't forget you deserve time to yourself to decompress just as much as she does. It doesn't matter that you may be always home. Taking any amount of time for yourself is important. "
I love when the real problem shows up in OP’s comments... it’s time to BE done.
"Derek makes me nervous and Sarah is an asshole. Fuck this coffee shop. I wouldn't waste my 20s on BS like this. You can do better, OP"
"I hate how manipulative this is — he brought it up two weeks before your wedding. So now you either A) postpone or cancel the wedding, which is SO hard emotionally and possibly financially, B) get married and give in to his demands, or C) get married and give in to living alone while he’s in a different country. It’s insane.

If he’s really serious, the best of those options is to postpone/cancel the wedding. It’s going to be REALLY hard, but if he doesn’t budge, don’t go through with this wedding."
"I agree, if a year has gone by and you haven't forgiven him(why should you) then I think it is time to say goodbye and move on. Blaming you is incredibly low of him. "
"^ he\she's right. It's been a month- its early. Have fun, be social, don't trip nor overdrink.

Be the person YOU'D want to go home with.."
"Yeah he’s either really stupid or intentionally manipulating you. You didn’t know what a sound bar is. It’s a very shitty present.

If he really wanted to get you speakers so you could listen to music together, there are MUCH better options than a sound bar. I have a 300 dollar soundbar and it’s way worse for music than a $120 pair of studio monitors I have. He got the soundbar because he wanted it, not because he thought you’d like it.  "
"Why would it be wrong for your mom to know she made you uncomfortable? She _did_ make you uncomfortable, and she _should_ know it."
"Pick a fictional character. Describe to them this fictional character. When they ask to see him, show them a picture of the fictional character. 

“You’re right. I do have a boyfriend. His name is Steve. He’s got blonde hair and blue eyes. Very respectful of women. He was in the army, too, and now he works on a very specialized team doing humanitarian efforts around the world.” Then show them a picture of Captain America. "
"99% probability she was already cancelling, the party was just coincidentally happening as well. "
"My dad is like this. My advice is leave. Now.

My mom stayed with my dad for 11 years and dealt with this. Ended up with a divorce, a cracked tooth (not from physical abuse, but stress and grinding her teeth at night), and 2 emotionally fucked up children.

So yeah. Don’t bother. He sounds like an ass. "
That sentence filled me with rage. 
"Too bad they're actually married already :/ OP, does your husband not realize your sister could have died? Or does he just not care?"
"Just block him, he's just trying to make you react."
"I just wanted to chime in my agreement that a lot of what he is feeling is a generational thing. I'm a bit older than your son and I think I coped differently, but my parents and I have also clashed over what they see as undue cynicism on my part. The thing is, older people don't realize how much things like the 2008 financial crisis shaped how we see the world. Your son may have been a bit young when that happened, but there's a good chance he still saw you or other families around him experience a lot of turbulence and upheaval as a result. And improvements since then haven't been felt evenly across society. He knows there are a lot of people his age trapped in menial, minimum wage jobs who won't be escaping that, starting families, or buying homes any time soon or possibly ever. He knows some of those people have debt from college degrees that are becoming more and more worthless with every year they remain unable to break into their field. 

And he might see that even those of us who could still be called ""lucky"" are facing increasingly exploitative conditions. A culture of impersonal legalism where the system is rigged for us to accept whatever conditions work in the interests of the corporations around us is taking over every aspect of life. Especially when you are young, these people take one look at you and know you don't have access to some team of lawyers or the means to shop around for the best terms available. You get trapped and shafted by these people, and you see rules cracking down on every outlet people used to have to better themselves from those situations. Whether it's the right to freelance out a skill, sublease property, or just get through life without facing enormous penalties just because you got a speeding ticket or a ding on your credit score, we know we are being screwed and there is very little we can do about it.

Maybe part of his problem is that he is tapped into the frustrations and culture of intense scrutiny that most people in his stage of life are up against without understanding how good he has it to just have parents who love him and will try to support him. For kids with no safety net thrust out into this world all at once, this is kind of a bad time to be alive and feeling both disposable and like any misstep could be catastrophic isn't entirely unjustified. It's understandable that a person his age could feel almost paralyzed by fear of what will happen if he dares to even try. It still might be best if you encouraged him to do something--literally anything--until he makes up his mind though. Even just working a customer service job will give him some feelings of autonomy and insight about what he really can't stand or realizes he can perform well. It also might increase his confidence and give him a more realistic perception of the competition. While he knows it is fierce out there, he is probably overestimating just how much of a disadvantage he actually is at just because he is a couple years behind where everyone is ""suppose to be"". He probably feels unfairly judged (as most of us do) yet his inaction and resistance to ever putting himself out there will probably only serve to deepen this complex.

Sorry if that got a bit rambley and ranty...best of luck to you are your son! It sounds like you're a great dad and he is going to be fine. All you can really do is keep giving the gentle encouragement you already are and let him work through this on his own with time."
"You don’t have to decide anything today, first of all.

You need therapists to discuss this with. This isn’t something you can figure out in 5 minutes. But what you can do is vow and promise to treat each other and yourselves with respect and love through this whole process. 

Good luck. "
"I feel like there is a way to go about this so people’s feelings are acknowledged and the effort they put into the gift is acknowledged as well. That being said, I don’t see anything wrong with exchanging a gift if they won’t use it BUT that doesn’t need to be communicated immediately upon receiving it. From your perspective, if you know she’s hard to buy for, include a gift receipt. Further, if you know she’ll likely exchange it anyways, just get her a gift card. 

Some people do not appreciate the sentiments of gifts, and you expecting a specific reaction from her will likely lead to disappointment. "
"####What did your husband expect in this situation? 

Does he think it would be okay for your 16 year old brother to handle sucidial sister *alone*, while she’s trying to jump out of the car while driving to the ER? Younger brother may not even have license! Doesn’t your husband think you should have been, “Fuck off, we’re going to NYC!” You could have easily gotten another call that there’s been an accident and both younger siblings died in a crash because sister was trying to jump out of the car.

Your husband is cold and irrational. Perhaps it’s better for you to spend your time with your family since he’s being a jerk."
"If she wants you to be a modern dad and do lots of childcare, she needs to be a modern woman and work full time too. If she wants you to be a traditional dad and pay all the bills, she needs to be a traditional woman and do the majority of the childcare. 

Either is fine! Both models are legitimate and the entire goal of feminism is that families should be allowed to choose whichever works better for them personally! But she absolutely cannot demand that she be provided all the good bits of both deals without upholding her end of either bargain, which it sounds like is what she's doing now, with you doing the majority of the childcare *and* working more hours *and* cooking etc. Even if she does all the other household chores other than cooking (who cleans? Does laundry? Mows the lawn?), you're still likely doing a lot more than half of the labor required to maintain a household, which ought to be split evenly among the adults in it. 

However, it sounds like you brought this up less than tactfully. I advise that you sit down with her and bring this up in a less adversarial way, but rather as a decision you'd like her to help you make, as a family. She can pick which half of the stuff she does, but she does have to do half. "
"I think that what you're saying is that your aunt gave you $100 in cash to buy Christmas gifts for yourself. You gave it to your mom so that you could order gifts using her credit card, but when the order amount went over $100, you cancelled it without telling her, which is when she got upset with you (for not telling her before cancelling it). 
  
To the above, I think that your mom was just frustrated because she was fine with the $4 and is upset that you think that you're not worth that extra $4. But I think that's not the real issue here--the real issue is that your mom wants you to be happy and thinks that you're great, health issues or not. But you seem very down on yourself--in your post, you talk a lot about how you won't be around anymore so your mom shouldn't spend money on you and how much of a burden you are on everyone. 
  
Humans don't work like that though--your mom loves you so much and wants you to be happy. This internet stranger wants you to be happy and thinks that you're definitely worth buying gifts for. Your mom wants to make every second of your life happy, if she could, and she wants you to feel happy with yourself. You sound pretty smart, despite your statements otherwise, but everything about your post indicates that you have very low self-esteem. Is it possible to see a therapist--many therapists have sliding scales. 
  
This isn't just about a Christmas gift--this is about low self-esteem. You are worth Christmas gifts and happiness! If you can see someone and talk about this, you definitely should."
This is the cycle of abuse. 
"Your grandma sounds like a r/JUSTNOMIL . 

Block her and move on. If she's toxic and hurtful towards your mother and is a professional victim player, it sounds like she does dramatic shit all the time. She can live with the consequences of being hateful and shit.

I disagree with everyone who says you should have just ignored it. It was an obvious insult and it sounds like she has a history of making these against your MOTHER. If you decide you don't want to have a relationship with someone who is hateful to 1 of your 2 parents (whom you have a good loving relationship with) then that is YOUR choice and you cannot be shamed or judged for that choice.

Don't give into her drama. Just drop the rope. Don't apologize or forgive or justify."
"His contact is all about him and what he wants.  It isn't about you at all.

If I discovered this I'd be freaking out and sick to my stomach. This is divorce level betrayal and deception.
Jesus fuck just confront her about it and tell her to stop playing it dude
"If we're playing the ""throw out theories to gauge his reaction"" game, OP might want to mention the main reason someone hides a large sum from their spouse: hiding an affair. The hockey tickets are more likely, but it might be worth bring up that this level of deception can reasonable call all his loyalties into question. "
"&gt;I talked to him alone afterwards and he said it meant nothing and I’m trying to create a conflict where there doesn’t need to be one

Your BF's reaction afterwards is pretty shitty. I can get making a joke without realizing its significance to you in the moment. It's not great but people make mistakes. However, it's really shitty of him to turn it on you after you talked with him about it.

I'd talk to him again about his reaction afterwards. He doesn't get to dictate how you feel about something, and I think with your background it's very understandable why you felt uncomfortable with that joke. If he still insists the problem is you then I'd seriously reconsider the relationship because he's acting like a 13 year old."
I had a roommate run with my $600 one month. Man that was rough. Came home to him moved out. Lost the money AND still owed his half. Still have not been able to get in touch with him 4 months later.

"The line ""don't make me act crazy"" tells you everything you need to know. If she ever hits you in the future, she wants you to think that it's your fault for causing her to react that way.

Yeah this. Daughter will heal and they’ll figure it out but OPs reaction suggests that this has happened before or will happen again

"Fully agree. “Good hugging height” and “good head”? If those are really some of the few reasons he *wants* to be with you, then you should break up with him anyway, that’s incredibly demeaning.

Add that to the fact that he’s trying to convince himself to break up with you in the first place...it’s pretty clear this relationship needs to end, regardless of whether his “cons” about you are true or not."
I think you have to stand up for yourself and say: “I’m not going to take on the entire cost of an accident that was not my fault.” 
"No advice just want to say you acted amazingly well in a very difficult situation. I hope this goes well, and he's in the right place to get help so there is no reason to think it won't. But however it turns out you have done an amazing job and should things go badly realise there is nothing more that you could have done. 

I suggest you get yourself to counseling asap as this is a lot for you to process. 

Big hugs and well done, you are amazing"
"He’s laying down the foundation to take advantage of you.  He’s spending your money on his food, not “sharing finances”.  And if he ever decides to skip out he’ll “pay the rent” and collect your half and leave you with rent-and-a-half.  You shoukd find a new roommate or living situation."

You can absolutely say “thanks so much for the invitation! I can’t make that weekend but I hope everyone has a great time.” You could even send a gift card for a round of drinks or something. Or not. Whatever seems best to you. 
"Ask yourself if you would still decide to stay married to her if there weren't kids involved. If the answer is no, then you need to start talking with her about a divorce. ""Staying together for the kids"" is a myth. Children only need healthy examples of social relationships in order to navigate them later in life; you don't have to be married to each other to provide that. If you and your wife are amicable after the split, you can still have that.

"&gt; He got mad cause he said he’d walk the dog and I just didn’t give him the chance. So I told the friend not to come but when I asked again I was NAGGING

This is the bigger problem. He's basically punishing you for asking him to do something/stick to his word, so that you'll eventually give up and stop asking or expecting any dog care from him at all (which you basically have). If you step in to take care of something he's been ignoring, you're at fault. If you expect him to step in, you're at fault. The only way to not be at fault is to either neglect the dog or do it yourself.

Try having a calm sit down conversation about this with him when you're not asking him for anything. And point out that if he has turned out not to be a dog person, that's okay, but if you're not able to take care of the dog he needs to either step in or hire/get a favor from someone to take care of Max. And he doesn't get to use the word ""nagging"" anymore, ever, about this. Hard boundary. He can't punish you for expecting that he'll live up to his promises."
"She sounds pretty selfish, dude. She had plans and broke them because she is too hung over and wants you to change your plans to accommodate her? This is a bad omen. "
"&gt; Should I chalk it up to a few too many drinks?

No, you should not.

If she had it in her to behave that way toward you while she was drinking, she has had it in her to behave that way toward you all along, and was merely covering it up.  Alcohol removed her ""consequences"" filters, and her existing inclinations came to the surface.

"My partner sometimes takes off his shirt when he mows the lawn. He has a very nice torso, so obviously he's doing that to send a signal to the neighbor women that my attention isn't enough and that he is trying to be sexually provocative. I am very, very concerned about the hidden signals he is sending to random women who might look at him. His body is not his, but mine, after all. It also belongs to all other women who might look at him and think something I'm uncomfortable with."
"Exactly. Don't start paying this guy rent. Not even for one month. Give that money directly to your landlord so that there is no confusion over who paid what.

Don't let this become a weird power move where **he pays the ""real rent"" and you're just subletting from him**. Seems like a dangerous precident to set.

If he doesn't like it, tough. He can go ask the landlord for a refund or have it credited toward next month's rent."
"Your first time as a teenager should not be an attempt to impregnate another teenager, yikes. Don't have sex with her!"

"You guys definitely re-evaluate your feelings about “wishlists” because it seems as though you are trying to be considerate of things she would be interested in, but missing the Mark. (Her liking the grapefruit scent so you getting it, her asking a lot about Apple Watches so you thinking she’d like one, etc.) if she’s not open to having a very specific wishlist at least set some categories or guidelines. Stuff like “I like getting clothing accessories but I hate fragrance. I love getting necklaces but I hate getting tchotchkes because they are useless clutter.” Etc.

And you two *definitely* need to work out this business of her being rude when you miss the mark. You can’t have a situation where you guys think lists eliminate the “thoughtful” aspect, but then she doesn’t appreciate the actual “thoughtfulness” enough to let you down gently when you mess up. That’s frustrating and I imagine it feels like a trap for both of you!"

"I can understand the comments saying it sounds like you may not have brought this up in the best way. However, in the larger sense she is in the wrong. But it’s not uncommon for people to not really understand that working from home is working. 

She needs to hear something along the lines of “I am not trying to shirk responsibility as a parent, but neither am I a stay at home dad. My amount of time available to our son, my level of tiredness, the level of childcare assistance I need, is not significantly less than it would be if I worked this same number of hours but in an office somewhere. In other words, it is not fair that I get far fewer “too tired to help” cards than you despite actually working more hours - and that you think that should be the status quo feels like you don’t think my work is real. It is. It isn’t my desire to take away your passion, and I did not mean to make you feel like I was making a demand of you without discussion, but it is an unavoidable fact that I need more help. Frankly, more of that needs to come from you regardless. But if you are willing to make lifestyle adjustments to afford childcare assistance so that you can keep your job, I am willing to pursue that avenue.”"

"I have gotten in serious accidents due to lack of sleep. This is exactly like driving drunk. She could injure or kill herself or someone else. 

If her grandmother owns the house, then it is the grandmother's problem, full stop. It is not your girlfriend's house unless her name is on the deed. If the grandmother told her ""I will put you in the will so that you get the house when I die,"" that means the house belongs to the grandmother and no one else. In other news, if the grandmother were to die still owing money on the house, then her estate would have to pay it off, and if it couldn't, the house would have to be sold. Also, this house is doing your girlfriend no good if the grandmother lives another 20+ years. 

If she is paying to live there and is not on the deed, she is not the owner, she is a renter, regardless of whether or not there is some sort of lease. The norm for renters is to pay market rate on their rental. Paying the mortgage, property taxes, and insurance is the owner's responsibility. 

If the grandmother put her on the mortgage, that would be the worst case scenario. That would mean that she was financially responsible for the house but still not the owner. She is only an owner is her name is on the deed as an owner or co-owner. If this is the case, she needs to see a lawyer immediately to see if there are options, such as bankruptcy, that get her off the mortgage. 

Therefore, she is a renter in a place she cannot afford. She needs to move out to a place she can afford. If the grandmother cannot afford the mortgage, that is not your girlfriend's problem. She is not responsible for decisions other people have made. 

 The whole setup sounds like a scam, frankly, or financial abuse. Somebody has convinced your girlfriend and her brother to financially support the grandmother. 

However, if your girlfriend is (as I'm guessing) effectively speaking a renter with no lease, she can and must walk away from this situation today. 

Sleep is a physical need. Have your girlfriend look up the effects of sleep deprivation, whether short or long term. Sleep deprivation has been linked to, among other things, memory deficits, obesity, mental disorders, even cancer and Alzheimer's. 

Whenever someone writes in here saying that their SO doesn't let them sleep, it signifies that the SO is physically abusive and we advise them to break up immediately. Sleep is a physical need; depriving someone of sleep is physical abuse. 

If your girlfriend is passing out on the sidewalk, this has reached crisis levels. Whatever setup has her 50% responsible for this house is straight up physical and financial abuse. I don't care if it is her grandmother. I don't know what kind of subhuman family pushed her into thinking this was a good or even tenable idea, but it is not a family that has her well being in mind in any sense. 

You are right that this story ends with her fired from one or more of these jobs and in the hospital or morgue. Then the fucking grandmother will have lost her cash cow anyway. Therefore your girlfriend doesn't have to postpone the inevitable. She can walk away from this shitshow today. 

Please show her this post. Fill in any details that clarify things and you or she can ask me anything. I have bought various houses in my life and I have a 23 year old son. I would never dream of putting him in this position, because I love him and *don't want him to fucking die*. Whatever your girlfriend has with her grandmother is not love. "
"I had to read this twice to check the dates. He got divorced seven years ago, and you're still expected to cater to his whims on no notice, because his depression will somehow be both the fault of the divorce and now your fault if you don't drop everything and spend your entire Christmas day driving? 

No. Just no. 

You are not responsible for his seven year long depression. And neither is your husband. (And neither is your husband's mother after 7 years, for what that's worth.) You are allowed to actually enjoy Christmas together, in your own home, without a guilt trip. 

Not sure why his family thinks they have the right to try to make you miserable if you opt to stay home, just because he's been depressed for the better part of a decade. Not to be a jerk or anything, but realistically a get together for one day isn't going to change that for him. He needs a competent therapist to fix that, not a party. "

"I agree, body dysmorphia was flashing red for me. My step sister who is 21 years old now, had a rhinoplasty at the age of 17 (to be honest she did have a bigger nose, but it looked good on her, she had the right type of face and it suited her, IMO) then she got the procedure done and looks like every other girl who got a nose job but (didn’t really) need one. Then at 20 after an awful break up she got a breast augmentation. This is all before she could legally drink at a bar. 

It broke my heart because I thought something is seriously wrong, she is a young, athletically built, beautiful and smart young woman aspiring to be a nurse, she has it all going for her. But she used to be so depressed and self loathe for years because of “the way she looked” which was perfectly fine... not just to me but lots of people, boys ogled over her as well. Anddd now she still seems pretty unhappy and never smiles, barely comes around anymore. Trying to get a smile or a laugh out of her is like pulling teeth. "

Also he lied to you about the money but went ahead and financed fun trips for his friends and himself with the money, fuck this dude. "
"I don't know that there is a clear answer here unfortunately.  It would be totally understandable if this was a deal breaker for you and you ended the relationship.  It would also be understandable if you forgave her - after all she did tell you swiftly/voluntarily, it was online instead of real life, and she wasn't in her normal state of mind.  Personally I would need to know more before deciding.  Why a man?  Did she want validation of her attractiveness after weeks of feeling like a mess, and it was easier to get from a man, or it seemed like less of a betrayal?  Why DD/lg?   Does she want a power exchange dynamic in her life?  You are currently reeling from *a lot* right now and you don't have to make a decision right away.

You need to take pictures to document the filth and get screenshots if your aunt has been insane enough to actually text you to clean HER bed that she PISSED IN.

And as others have said, I’d tell them that between the homeless guy showing up the middle of the night, the toxic fumes from an undisclosed flooring job, the mess, and the extra time added to your commute because of the above, you will not be available to help out with housesitting/pet sitting in the future. 

Btw, I wonder if anyone else has said or thought this...did it occur to anyone else that they purposely scheduled the flooring job when they would be out of town so they wouldn’t have to deal with the toxic fumes or the mess and could get you to deal with it and suffer through it. Just food for thought since most companies will have the family leave during processes like that for comfort if not health reasons. "
"Well, let's be fair: this sounds like recently ramped-up crazy behavior, so it's probably taken OP off-guard (especially since the Christmas plan was initially no problem for her mother) and it's HARD to come to terms with this behavior from parents. Plus, way more crazy has happened in between posts. 

But yes, all the lying is really worrying. And I think a person that melts down at the thought of OP and her husband having Christmas alone is going to *really* freak out if they try to do things as a nuclear family once Baby is here. "
"OMFG DO NOT MARRY THIS MAN.

He is showing you who he is, BELIEVE IT.

He will be WORSE with children. Babies cannot play or be cute for at least a year. They cry a ridiculous amount. The noise will interrupt his 'sleep', or he'll put the crib in a closet or something.

Babies are not puppies. They won't self feed from dishes, they don't get released in the backyard to pee, and you can never tell what it's for when they are crying. Imagine the baby is colicky, which means all it wants is to be held, which several month old, 'normal' puppies generally don't do.

If he can't behave with a dog he chose to get, then NO FUCKING WAY do you make him a potential father. My ex was JUST. LIKE. THIS. He claimed to want children, we had them, he lost his fucking mind. He insisted he wanted our second child, but as his (ex husband's) behavior got worse and worse, he called them 'my' (as in MY) children.

My kids were born with autism, which made things worse.

I'm not sure if autism is on the rise, it's being misdiagnosed, or there are simply better trained pediatricians that can identify the signs more readily. Maybe it's all of the above. But this, as well as other disorders are a strong possibility these days, are you really willing to have children with a man that will have tantrums that can affect their development and behavior so badly?

"I can speak firsthand from the perspective of someone whose mother cheated on my dad. I also suspect they weren't really in love for many years but stayed together for me and my brother. When I found out, I was absolutely devastated. My mom has always been my hero and her infidelity shattered my faith and trust in the world in general for a while. With time and therapy, I now understand why she did it, although I still strongly disagree with her choice. My dad also had a lot of mental health/anger issues - I wouldn't call him abusive (which I would call your dad based on what you wrote), but he was not a good father or husband. My mom dedicated her life to her children's happiness and her infidelity was her way of escaping a marriage that was extremely draining and miserable.

Talk to your mom. Absolutely do not tell your dad as he does not sound stable or safe. Please take care of your own feelings first, but hear your mom out. It helped me immensely to talk to my mom in-depth about her marriage with my dad and why she did what she did."

Use this experience as a true life lesson to live the life YOU want - to grow into the man you want to be and be strength for others. Your path to wisdom has begun but it's up to you to walk it.

I've been on the giving and receiving end of cruel pranks. There's nothing I can say to reduce the sting. Your post has me tearing up at work. It's trite to say don't let this get you down. It does. But you can grow from this and I hope you take the journey to be a better man than your relatives."
"How he acted was abusive. I see abusive red flags. 1. Humiliation in public 2. Blaming you. 3. Guilting you over sex. 4. His passive aggressive threat 5. Basically abandoned you.

You need to consider a separation and counseling. Individual and couples. The red flags need to be addressed."
"If you haven’t read it before, I would recommend to read The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman. It could be that “gift giving” is not one of his love languages. Perhaps he expresses his love in a different way and he may not realize fully that you feel loved by, from what you describe, actions and gifts (which are 2 of the love languages). He may express and receive love by words or affirmation or quality time, for instance (2 of the other languages). I hope this helps!"
"I see your edits, but let’s be real here. She deserves to know not only that she’s married to a creep but that her health is being put in danger by her husband without her consent. 

Wouldn’t you want someone to tell you?"
"Write a pro/con list for him.

Pros: good hugging height, appreciates head, likes my sense of humour.

Cons: utterly shallow, does not see me as a real human being, cannot communicate like a grown adult despite being one, stupid enough to write a pro/con list, take a picture of it, and keep it on his phone.

Then leave the list, along with a note mentioning that you are leaving, and GTFO. :)"
"She's stealing your Dad's stuff.  You know that, right?

"
"If you can, find a new job. If not, keep interactions with your boss to a minimum and be cordial in a professional way. Focus on the work at hand and try not to overthink what's going on, socially. 

Don't read into his behaviour. Don't confess feelings for a boss (or someone junior to you) in the future. It's wildly inappropriate and will only interfere with your work. "
"&gt;I don't understand why he thinks any of this is anything to get upset over.

He doesn't. The reason he's getting passive aggressive and ignoring you is because he's trying to scam you, that's why he's doing first rather than asking first. He's not shared a single expense - he's just straight up put it on you. Have you contacted the landlord and checked that they've recieved the full amount?

There is no friendship here. He's a leech. "
"I assume OP meant that you'd call him before making the IG post. I assume you didn't make the IG post before you bought the car, so after you bought the car you could make any calls/posts you wanted, yeah? "
Please don’t apologize! You’re telling me what I need to hear. 
"No problem. You can say similar things to other family members. So; “I did hear she was upset not to be included in the bridal party. I was surprised to hear this given the fact that we’ve barely talked over the last few years and she routinely ignores my texts. The wedding party is already set, of course, but hopefully her interest in being in the party means she’s interested in having a closer relationship with me outside of just having an interest in the wedding. We used to be really close and the way she has distanced herself over the past few years was painful to me. I plan to reach out and invite her to talk more about it.” "
"I was going to tell him something but my sister said I need to frame it in a way that doesn't make him angry, she said if i say something and make him angry he may go home and take it out on his wife.

My sisters main concern is that she doesn't want him to become violent with her, because my sister was also in an abusive relationship not too long ago."
"So if your dad wrote about this, we'd advise him to lawyer up, get a real divorce and a real custody arrangement, and be there for his kids. It's plausible that the court could compel child support paid from your mother to your father.

You know your father best. If he's capable of doing this, leveling with him about how bad it is, might strengthen his resolve to do something better for you here.

If you really don't think your father is good for it, then you're finding your way out the best you can - I'd suggest a part time job, good grades, and as far away as possible to college. Be the best ""stepdaughter"" you can possibly be, to your father's girlfriend, and stay with them as much as possible in the interim.

I would say that your mother is alcoholic (based on what you've told us), and the resources from AA aimed at families of alcoholics, could be good for you."
" &gt; how do I end things without completely devastating him?

What do you mean by 'completely devastating'? If you mean, he's going to be sad, be emotionally wrecked, cry a  lot, etc? Yeah, that happens with most unwanted breakups. That's just life.

If you mean 'ruining his life'. Yeah, no. He has been coasting partially because he's had you to fall back on. When you break up with him, it will cause some difficulties in his life, but he is stronger than you both give him credit for. He will deal and cobble some kind of life together. This may be the impetus that finally causes him to adult up. Or he may just keep living like a 21 year old. But either way, he will be ok. "
"Omg, yes. This was the kicker. The other stuff is not great, but that he was pissed when the gifts he knew she would dislike didn't change her image enough to suit him?!

He's treating her like an actual doll. "
"You back away from this tire fire right now.  He has set it up intentionally to have two women fighting over him and he can’t wait to see how it turns out while he strings you both along and has sex with you both while trashing you both to each other. I mean, if you want a life filled with drama, go for it, but if not, kick him out and block him. "
"You must create boundaries right now. If she just happens to drop by do NOT let her in. Let her stand outside knocking all day but do not ever, ever see her on her terms again. Do not answer texts or accept phone calls that aren’t scheduled. Tell her you’ll call her every Monday night at 7 (or whenever). If she insists on seeing you, always a neutral location, like a Starbucks. That way when she acts like a crazy person (and she will) there will be witnesses. 

She plans to be in your life every minute of every day whether you like it or not. The only think stopping that is you putting your foot down and standing firm. "
"His desire for physical pleasure doesn’t take  precedence or negate the fact that piv hurts and you don’t want to do it. 

He knows what is going on and the pouting is weird. He’s legit pouting that you won’t feel excruciating pain for 3 minutes so he can get his rocks off. "
"I couldn't agree more with this comment. She shows traits of a sociopath behaviour, you and your parents should be aware of. Telling her parents would not help much."
"The second your mom finds out you’re pregnant, she’s going to act like nothing happened. Don’t let her get away with it. She needs to be accountable for her lies."
"Well, I mean that's it excatly, isn't it? You got excited and happy and proud. And you didn't think to call him. You didn't even think about him. My partner would be so hurt if during a big moment, telling him my exciting news didn't even occur to me. 
You literally forgot he existed for a moment there. Think about what that says about your relationship."
"I had an ex-boyfriend plan a proposal during the period of highest tension in our relationship. I think some guys get it into their heads that a proposal will smooth everything over and that their girlfriend will be too into planning a wedding to remember the problems in the relationship. The fact that this guy is planning a big dramatic public proposal suggests to me that this is what’s going on in his head - he wants to make it hard for her to say “no,” and he’s hoping that an engagement will make her resentments melt away. 

It’s gonna backfire *hard*. "
"Good riddance to bad rubbish IMO. Her family are a bunch of enabling tools as well:

&gt;You don't need to be embarasesd about it, we've all been there once.

Crashing our cars after driving with a BAC *four times the legal limit*? No we fucking haven't ""all been there once"" Jesus H"
"Yup, it's a shitty feeling to be in OP's position. Sometimes a break up will cause someone to realize how much they fucked up (and subsequently just lost) but you generally have to stay broken up for that lesson to stick. If a week later you say ""lesson learned"" and get back together, that just teaches him that it takes a week of good behavior to get what he wants. 

I've broken up with 2 people for similar reasons to the OP and guess what they both did? Got their shit together and married the very next woman they dated. It is super difficult to deal with that happening, but OP I hope you have a good support system to help you through this, you are definitely making the best decision for yourself by ending the relationship and asking him to stay elsewhere. Good luck to you &lt;3"
"Don't do anything until you have talked to her and found out what happened last night. 

And yes, you need to make more friends. Don't put all your friendship eggs in one basket."
"Splitting might be the best thing for him tbh, if it forces him to be more self-reliant."
"Gotta ask the question, do your in laws approve of you? Have they been whispering poison in his ear on your trip there? Is your husband usually tense and snappish after interacting with his folks?"
"You're not fat, but even if you were this wouldn't be acceptable. Your mom needs to do a better job standing up for you, and it's excellent that you're going to get out of that environment. This is honestly verbally abusive behavior. Please remember that it's him who has the problem, not you. "
I think I’d tell your friend. That’s rough. 
"Of all the relationship books, theories,advice,etc; i really like the love languages theory. It seems to be accurate for me in my current relationship."
"&gt;The only point of wearing a crop top is to show more skin and the only point of that is to be more sexually provocative.”

yeah...he's a bit fucked in the head. didn't you know that literally EVERYTHING you do is about men??? /s obviously, but that's what he's saying. Sadly, this is how a lot of men think, and it's what leads to bullshit like harems and veiling. I would consider this a pretty serious issue if I were you. "
I’d probably find somewhere else to stay pretty quickly.  And get your drugs out of her place.  It’s a good thing however that it was an antibiotic she had the picture of 
"Hell no, she should break up with him. Screw that guy."
"Sweetheart, you don't want to win this guy back. I agree with the others, this was rape. He prevented you from using your safe word, you were screaming and screaming and it was obvious that you did not want to continue. He carried on and raped you.

I don't know where you are so I don't know what services are available to rape victims in your area, but you may find it useful to contact them for assistance in how to deal with what has happened to you.

Furthermore, no one else seems to have said this, so I feel I ought to bring it up. He finished inside you without a condom. If you aren't covered by birth control pills at the moment, you need to get hold of the morning after pill (Plan B) as soon as you can. Despite the name, it can be used for several days following unprotected sex."
"What the hell..it's your twin for God's sake, I'd be shocked if you guys hadn't seen each other naked at some point in your lives. Most siblings have seen each naked, I'm sure. It might be weird if you still do now, but goodness, I doubt there's any incest so your girlfriend needs to take a chill pill."
I also think it odd OP never asked her husband why. She sees it as an issue of being accepted or not...but that is really missing the point. 
"I would also do something like this. Explain to them why the 'advice' is wrong. They wouldn't want to be treated like that, right? "
"I can't imagine how exhausted you must be.  Obviously no one here sees the totality of your relationship with your husband, and we're looking at it from your perspective, but if the reality is even half of how you've described it here... you've got to feel so completely burned out.

You are doing the emotional work of two people, all the time.  You are managing your own life and emotions and expectations and aspirations and, you know, daily responsibilities of adult living, PLUS all of those things for your husband, too.  Because if you don't, he won't/can't, and things will fall apart.  This isn't the way that healthy adults live, or the way that healthy relationships work.  I imagine the weird feeling you got when Hunter and his brother fixed the leak by the furnace was because he expected you to be delighted and surprised that he did it -- because he doesn't understand that that sort of thing is expected of someone who is an equal, respectful, loving participant in a relationship.  It's not a surprise, or a gift.  It's a normal Tuesday.

You have some very big decisions to make.  You've said yourself that you don't believe Hunter is capable or willing to do the things he needs to do to get better.  He cut off counseling after 9 sessions (and you know he lied to you about it.  You know him. You see his anxiety every day and how crippling it is.  You know that no counselor would 'graduate' him out of therapy.  That was a lie).  Whenever you ask him to do simple, straightforward things, he just doesn't do them.  The only thing in this situation that's going to change is YOU.  And that's a daunting thing, which is why I think it's very important that you go to a counselor on your own.  If it were me in your shoes, I would want someone qualified to help me figure everything out.

As I was reading your post, I just kept thinking, ""This woman is drowning.""  I hope you know that you deserve a relationship that makes you feel supported -- not just one where you do all the supporting."
"Exactly, if your his GF it should be expected of him to be with you on NYE, even if he wants to go to a friends house or a party he should be expecting to bring you AND your friend with him.  If you tell him OK we are coming too and he has a weird/bad reaction then he is definitely hiding something. 

Sometimes people are bad at communicating, maybe he didn't realize that he had to tell you that you were welcome to come with him, maybe he thought it was implied?

Honestly see what he says when you invite yourself along.  You don't want to be dating a guy who excludes you from friendly social events, not just because he may be cheating but also because that's just not how you treat a partner."
"Had she ever been scuba diving before? Because her reaction could be totally normal for someone who’s never done it before and now there’s all this pressure to have this magnificent experience. 

Not your fault; your heart was in the right place but lesson learned. Some ideas are better than others. Better to “work up” to an experience like this next time. "
"You’re asking a bunch of westernised strangers on the internet for advice, of course we’re going to tell you to ‘just go’. We’ve been busily making our own adult decisions since we were 18, some of us even longer (I moved to the other side of the world at age 17 with my parents consent). The fact is, nobody here is going to understand your set of circumstances because that’s not the way we have been raised. 

So the choice is yours. At some point, you’re going to have to stand up and make it known that you’re not willing to follow the path your dad has picked out for you and that you can’t live within the repressive confines of his culture any more. Is that going to be this trip, or the next one, or when he starts choosing a husband for you...? Only you can decide. Eventually it’s going to have to happen. The longer you wait, the more you’ll miss out on and the more resentment will fester within you. It’s up to you to decide when you’re ready to fight for your moral and legal right to make your own decisions. 

Good luck to you, whenever that time comes. "
"At the very least call off the engagement. Take as long as you need to decide if you want to just co-parent or try to work through it.

Edit: typo (ling--&gt;long)"
"Because unfortunately it doesn't sound like he's going to be any more honest about it in the future than he was in the past. She's asked and asked, and he just keeps hemming and hawing, unfortunately you can only hear lies and deflection so many times before you realize you're never going to get the truth. "
"Same thing goes for *so many* aspects of the human experience.  

Even business shit goes this way. You ask for a raise 5 years in a row and get nothing, then you accept an offer somewhere else and all of the sudden there's a counteroffer.  

Or dealing with vendors, like your cable company. They refuse to fix the problem you're having until you threaten to cancel, then all of the sudden it's 6 months free HBO.  

And don't even get me started on environmental issues! We'll finally be getting our shit together regarding climate change *after* florida gets swallowed by the sea.  

People in general just don't take things seriously until they're at risk of losing them or after they're already gone."
"I don’t know many specifics for this sort of issue but look up and call a local women’s shelter, and find resources online for people dealing with abusive relationships. Professionals will be able to tell you what the safest and best way is to handle situations like this. "
"Woah, bonuses can't be depended upon. My partner was lucky with them then something changed in his business and they vanished. She isn't being terrible responsible here &amp; you don't live together, so why does she expect expenses for her professional life to be covered by you!? It's her career, her expenses... expecting financial investment from a partner you don't even cohabit with it bizarre to me."
"One little thing jumps out at me – when you told her the Apple watch could ""help her to be more active"" could that have been read as a criticism? Are your gifts more like hints or lessons?"
"Comments so far have covered a lot of the important ground. If and when you break up with him, it's important to remember that he willfully engaged in behavior he had to know at the time was wrong, hid this from you, and attempted to avoid responsibility when discovered, even shoving some of that responsibility onto you, dredging up whatever he was not happy with you about as ways to justify his behavior. (Also, ""vulnerable"" to a beautiful woman? The word puts him in the role of a victim.) An important question to ask yourself is, if a similar situation arose in the future, would he do the same thing again? Since he hasn't taken full and unconditional responsibility for his actions, it seems likely the answer is yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please keep in mind that if you break up with him, he's likely to react in a very hostile manner, with even more justifications for his past behavior and more blaming you. You need to stand your ground and not let him start a new discussion whose purpose is to convince you that what you're doing is unreasonable. By way of explanation, it would be best to keep it short and simple, something like ""I've tried my best to get past this, but I can't, and I've realized that this is not a relationship I can be in."" I would suggest not reminding him of what he did, or getting into the emotional difficulties of the past year. He'll ask ""why?"", probably repeatedly, but it'll be an attempt to make you justify your actions; after all, it's not as though he doesn't know that this has been a huge issue. "
There is no way a hockey trip is going to set you back 35k.  
"But even after making the purchase, maybe he thought you’d call him first before basically making a general post for everyone? Idk personally I still think he’s being dramatic even if that’s the case but it’s worth considering if that’s where his annoyance is coming from. I’d give him a day or two to calm down and then ask him what it’s really about."
"This is beyond communication issues; this is emotionally and mentally abusive and manipulative. 

Healthy, loving, respecting spouses don’t “punish” each other like he does too, whether it is known to you or not. You should not feel like you have to walk on eggshells to avoid his anger or “punishment” because of some transgression. This is not a healthy relationship. You said in another post this is cyclical, also very common for abuse. 

I highly recommend you go to some individual counseling and discuss your marriage with them because I think your perspective may be somewhat manipulated by your relationship with him. There is also the book “Why Does He Do That?”  (Bancroft) which you can find for free online as well. Please read it but don’t let him see it."
"I would absolutely go. You’re going to regret not getting the experience later if you don’t, and probably resent him for it. I don’t know you or your relationship, but just based on my own experience and what I have seen with my own friends, this person is most likely not the person you end up with. If that is the case, and you stay in your hometown, you will wish you would have gone. Do it for you! Good luck!"
"Hmm, something in this comment touched a nerve in me. I bought my wife (then girlfriend) an orange sarong when I was working in Hawaii and she never wears it. She never has, and every once and a while I'll remember it, feel bad, bring it up, and get a noncommittal answer.

It's not a pattern of behavior or anything, just maybe one or two things here or there. I've gotten her plenty of wearable things that she likes and wears. It honestly has never occurred to me that maybe she might even like the sarong but some part of it just isn't her style. I liked it, so I thought she would like it, and I was excited for her to like it. But maybe she doesn't.

I mean she's a businesswomen and it is a sarong, but still we go on appropriate outings. Maybe she's just the sarong lady for it. Thanks for providing some perspective."
but you had the time to post on social media before letting him know? it seems like there are some major communications issues going on here 🤷‍♀️ I would also be pissed in his shoes 
"&gt; He ... has threatened to go regardless of whether I agree to come with

""Great, off you go. Goodbye and good luck.""

He's not thinking like a partner. He's not thinking about what this move would mean for you, your career, your marriage together, your combined earning potential, your future together, or even his own career. He's just thinking about his ego. He wants to follow his dream, and he expects you to follow him, regardless of what the cost would be to you. And the cost to you, you career, your earning potential, your future, would be significant.

I think it's fair to say that if he's serious about pursuing this ""career"" (in reality, a delusion), your relationship has run its course. "
"As they say, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"
"Up until recently, no one ever dreamed that DNA tests would be available to everyone with $99 to spare.  Certainly not during the decades when you and tens of thousands of other babies were being conceived with donors and not being told.  No one ever thought they would have to have the conversation.  It's not like you were adopted because your mom gave birth to you.  Most people looked at it like they just had a little help with things and left it at that.  Infertility is nothing to be ashamed about, but most parents don't want one child to feel different in any way, especially during adolescence.  Siblings can be mean to each other.  He's my dad, not yours type of thing.  

I know it's hard for YOU to look at it that way now that you have found out and I certainly don't blame you, but try and cut them some slack.  They honestly weren't trying to hurt you by not telling you.  Quite the opposite.  They love you.

I would get your parents alone and tell them calmly that you took a DNA test and it came back with several ""half-siblings""  and when you contacted them, you found out they were all from the same sperm donor.  I think that after your brother took the test, they have been sweating this one out, waiting to see if you would test.  I think it may be a bit of relief to have it out in the open at this point.  Just let the conversation evolve from there.  

Good luck OP.

"You aren’t paranoid and you aren’t wrong. This isn’t just an ex... it’s an ex SHE CHEATED WITH. If she doesn’t respect your wishes, even after you’ve told her how it makes you feel, I’d suggest getting a third party involved like a therapist or family member. "

"You did nothing wrong. She is crazy, you need to get out of there ASAP. Give yourself a Christmas present and leave her."
The joke itself I think could be chalked down to an honest mistake - his reaction afterwards are where the red flags lie. 
"This reminds me of a Will &amp; Grace episode, where Will insists he's okay with his friends dragging him to all these things on his birthday that he doesn't want to do - only to explode at them and sulk because he didn't want to do them. 

Thing is, you can only be so mad at people for acting like you're okay with something after you told them you're okay with it. "
"Yeah, you don't need to apologize for using the nanny cam. It's not a secret the camera is there, and it's no different than if you'd gotten out of bed to see why the baby was still crying. He's mad he got caught lying, not for you ""spying"" on him. 

It sounds like he got very nasty after he got caught, and he's the one who should be apologizing for that behavior (and for not taking care of the baby properly). "
"You handled it perfectly.  It's not your problem if she can't handle a normal office relationship.    

I would tell a superior about this (because she is going to make a racket) - just to alert them to what happened, not to ask them to do anything or talk to her.  But just be calm and collected when having discussions about it and make her look flustered and crazy.  Continue to be polite and professional in your interactions with her, try to email her if you need to interact with her for work purposes (best to send documented requests in case she spins a story) and keep maintaining your boundaries."
Okay. And tell me again why you are considering having sex with this person? You need to start thinking with your other head. Fast 
Sounds a lot like gaslighting to me. 
"This. E and Xanax are VERY different and he shouldn’t be pressuring you to get off of it if you’re prescribed it. Honestly he sounds horrible and as someone with chronic depression, PTSD and anxiety I can tell you having a bad partner makes it WORSE. GET OUT. "
"Ha. Women can attract unwanted 'male attention' even if they are wearing a parka. If he doesn't understand that, he's a bit naive, and definitely being controlling.

"""Dad, had we known in advance, we might have been able to make arrangements to attend, however the night before was not sufficient notice. We are both scheduled to work and by the time we get off, would not have enough time to travel, enjoy the festivities and return home. Perhaps we can schedule a time in the coming weeks to celebrate together.""

Btw just expect more negativity. My dad hated that we spent Christmas morning with mom and then drove over for Christmas afternoon and spent boxing day. I thought it made it special. Apparently dad had pity parties because it wasn't Christmas morning. "
"Yea I stopped reading after she said she stopped taking her meds after he said he didn’t believe in depression. Who the fuck is this asshole? And again, where did Dr Know Nothing get his medical Degree? University of “I like to manipulate and interfere with the health of women?”"
"**This!!**

He already threatened to go without OP.  The fact that he’s even considering that means his fantasy is more important than her.  That all the support she has given him and the 6 years they’ve shared together is easily tossed aside for him.


That’s fucking hurtful!


Call his bluff, OP!  Tell him “Good Luck” and when he comes crawling back you’ll already have some one better."
"Honestly I wouldn’t give this guy that much goodwill. He has already tried to manipulate OP for her money twice, I think she should just be straight up with him. “I will be giving the landlord my rent directly, and I don’t share finances with roommates. Thanks for understanding.”

And because he seems like the type to become a Nice Guy^TM I would start looking for a new place to live if I was OP."
"&gt;I did skip the movie marathon and a massive argument followed that lasted the entire weekend. **Apparently Mark was on his best behavior**, a point that my bf kept going back to.  

Since none of the other posters have mentioned it, I think I should bring up just how fishy **this** is. Because Mark was able to be on his ""best behavior"" when you weren't around, it's pretty clear that he knows HOW to behave, but chooses to be an ass when you are around.

I suspect Mark's goal is to get you and your BF to break up so he can have his ""bro"" back (both without girlfriends)."
"You’ve talked to just about everyone in your family except the person that it would affect the most, which is your dad. It’s his parentage, so if anyone gets a say in this test that you want to do, it’s him. Talk to your father before you go any further with this.

I get that you feel like you’ve blown the lid off something, but this has the potential to be incredibly hurtful to someone you love. You’re basically looking to confirm that the one person who loved your father as a child was also not his biological father. Take some time, and really consider what kind of outcome you’re aiming for. Are you looking for more recrimination against your grandmother? Because she’s already been cut off. There isn’t much more to be done there. Are you looking to shake your father out of his denial? Because the only one who can really help your father deal with his past is himself, and possibly a therapist if he goes that route. Throwing a bombshell like this isn’t going to suddenly make him get over his abuse.


Take some time, and think about this, and talk to your dad before you do anything."
"Dude is a fair weather husband, you’ve learned this now. “For better or worse, in sickness and in health” - the are just words he repeated, not actual vows to take seriously. 

I’m guessing this is the first truest hard life experience you went through while with him? Now he’s shown you what to expect of him. Don’t expect him to be there for you, don’t expect him to pick up the slack if you need it. Don’t expect to be comforted. 

This is an insane level of self-centerdness, I would not expect personal growth on his part."
You have every right to be upset. I would be too. Just because you can't drink doesn't mean you shouldn't be included in the festivities.

Re-extending trust is a loan, based on the security and quality of response. She’s expecting a loan without security or quality. 

Personally I wouldn’t trust her intentions. I would cut your losses now. This isn’t looking good."
"Yeah, completely unacceptable for him to be unreachable. This was an actual emergency that he actually peaced out for for completely childish reasons.

OP, if he isn’t willing to apologize and examine his behavior, consider couples counseling. Ya’ll are only 24/25; this could become more serious down the road."
"Do not read people's private journals. She may have been venting, considering her options, letting off steam, and used writing as a coping strategy during a tough time. Perhaps she has since had a good conversation with your dad about everything. Journals are not for objective narratives, and this is probably not even full side of *her* story, let alone an objective view into their marriage. Move on, forget you ever invaded your mother's privacy.  "
Why didn’t he go with his wife to help out in this situation? 
"Leaving early in your career will wreck your career path.  These are the formative years of your professional development.  I have been a lawyer for 10 years and if I missed 2 years for anything but maternity/paternity leave, i would have a tough time getting back into it."
"I think the key to this is the upcoming wedding. Is it possible that this is how his “cold feet” are manifesting? Maybe he sees your wedding as that hard line of “this is what the rest of my life looks like”, so he is having some remorse that his dreams didn’t pan out. I would schedule a counseling session with your officiant ASAP."
"To be clear, she hasn't paid you back for the first loan yet? And has tried twice since then to borrow more money?

100% don't continue to loan money to someone who hasn't demonstrated that they're willing and able to pay their existing debts. Her money issues aren't your problem. Why does she need ""money on hand"" to attend seminars for her job, though? What kind of sketchy job is refusing to pay for her training, but implying that the training is mandatory for success?"
"I had a military friend this happened to and it broke him for years. I think you should totally tell him, he deserves to know what she's been up to and what she's capable of before he marries her. How bad will you feel when she keeps doing this after the wedding?"
"Ok. If he hadn't scared you would you have dropped your child? 
No. 

So, that means he was obviously involved with the incident. it comes out of your JOINT bank account. "
Yo - this story is creepy AS FUCK. Why didn’t you confront her about “randomly” spying on your house? I would have... 
"Please don't do this. When I was 17, I got into a relationship with a man 7 years older than me and he wanted the same thing... He fucked with my birth control on more than one occasion.  I didn't get pregnant, thank fuck, but it was scary shit. I was with him for 2 years until I realized how predatory he is. I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to trap you into being with her... You should consider being with someone your own age. Not a grown ass woman who has no business being with a teenager. "
"File an incident report with your boss and/or human resources if there is one.  Your personal life and your religious beliefs are none of Miss Quirky’s damned business.  Yes, you can complain to your superiors no matter how good friends they are with her.  They need to have a counseling session with her, moving toward progressive discipline. The lady is harassing you.  You might want to go over to the askamanager website also."
"&gt;I get the feeling that she would prefer I was marrying a Christian girl, though she would never say that. That said, she has always been nice and perfectly welcoming and pleasant to my fiancee.

Are you sure? Because it would be fairly easy for you to miss interactions between them that make your fiancee think your mom doesn't like her. It doesn't have to be any big action."
There is literally no way he is a good listener 
"Not only that, but she states the child is getting too big for her to carry/hold, something I assume he knows. So, he: 

- asks her to hold child, knowing child is too big for her

- scares her, causing her to drop child

- blames her for an accident that was his fault 

- adds in a fun monetary punishment 

WOW"
"Imagine if this was the girlfriend of a good friend. Imagine him telling you about this girl, the one that drunk drives, acts entitled, is largely unrepentant and then blames him for making her ""feel bad.""

Would you tell him to stay with her? Would you see her as a keeper? Probably not. This girl sounds like a hot mess express to anyone but you apparently. 

Kick her trashy ass to the curb and save years of your life."
"No wonder you are getting depressed, everytime you bring up a concern he makes you feel bad. Mabey you were a little bit wrong for hating his present, and you could have expressed your dissapointment different. But the way he makes you feel like a fucking villiand and he might forgive you if u're lucky, makes him sound like a spoiled brat himself."
"Of course ... but you don’t want to stay with someone who doesn’t treat you well, either. I wasn’t implying it would be easy ... but how you said it was coming across as you thinking you have no other option but to get over it. I’m so sorry you’re hurting."
"Ask your brother in law and sister how much you should contribute for rent, instead of splitting half with your mom.
Then they will let you know how much is fair for you to pay anything more than what you are giving them. If they don’t want you to pay anything more, then do not, and clearly tell your mom.
Never give her money directly. And congrats! This is awesome that you are financially independent and paid for your own education. Very badass.
"
"I do not understand what any of that has to do with ""manic pixie dream girl"" but his behavior does sound exasperating.  Make it clear you are tired of it and if he continues, then find someone else.

Neither of you sound like you are 30."
"Well if you have a family with him the way he is now, you'll not only be even more miserable than you are now, you'll be bringing kids into the misery as well and giving THEM a miserable life. "
"Man, you have no clue how many people wanted me to work for them last minute (think artwork). The gall was amazing. But I just repeated to all of them that I had been booked for months for projects (since August). 

I agree with your polite version. Then mute. Then chuckle. Then eat. "
"Agree with the counseling advice 100%. Once this level of contempt (laughing in her face, rolling his eyes) has seeped into a marriage, it is poisoned, and the marriage needs professional help to get it back to normal. Sounds like dad needs to have full 100% responsibility of the baby for a few days as well. 

ETA: re-reading the post I can see that leaving the kid with dad for a few days could be disastrous. Ignore that part! "
"My husband and I started dating on Oct 26. Halloween was right around the corner. He had tickets to a Halloween ball with his ex. I was so upset that he was still planning on going. But I held my tongue and decided to see what would happen. 

He went. Was at my house by 10. Never talked to her again. We’ve been together 12 years. Married for 7. 

Sometimes dating a good guy means they honor prior obligations they’ve made. Don’t take it too personally. Enjoy the night and see where you guys stand in 2019. "
"He hears her, he doesn’t care. She disappoints him and he wants her to be a different version of herself."
"She's afraid that the rumors might make it back to you so she's trying to control the message and paint herself in the best possible light.     

I've learned that when you ask someone why they did something and their answer is:  ""I don't know.""  What they really mean is:  I'm telling you a story, it's not the truth, it's my story, and I can't explain myself because I'm not telling you the truth, so any explanation would expose my lies, so I'm just going to say, ""I don't know.""  "
"I’m so sorry that he treated you like that. I worry about what will happen when there’s a real conflict- a ring not fitting is hardly the end of the world. I think y’all need to talk about this, and if he can’t realize what he did was wrong, apologize and work on it, I don’t think it would be safe for you to stay in this relationship. 
Also: calling any part of your body “fucking fat” is gross and would probably be a dealbreaker for me personally. "
"I think you are right to be upset. You had plans together, with your friend, and he has completely ditched those plans like it’s no big deal without even offering for you and friend to join? WTF? I’d be furious."
Do you really want to get caught up in all of that? That sounds like a dealbreaker.
"The little shit thinks he’s doing work, he thinks because he’s made an effort that you should be grateful to him. That is why he has thrown such I huge tantrum. 
I absolutely HATE the situation you’re in, I have been there twice. Two giant baby men who think that you can magically drift off the sleep while they ignore the baby and do nothing. 

Ugh no advice, I’m here if you want to vent pm me. 
You’re not alone, what he did was wrong and extremely rude "
"This isn't about him at all. He does sound great. But this is about your insecurities and comparing yourself to other people. It's not helpful or healthy, and it will eat away at your relationship. You need to work on seeing what you bring to the world and your relationship to build a healthy life for yourself and together."
"The other day, we noticed that our female dog smelled like old man cologne. Turns out that my dog’s natural scent + rubbing on the Christmas tree = the smell of an Old Spice knock off. So I wouldn’t really put much stock into random smells on an old couch. 
"
"So I have experience doing this. My husband gets moved around for work. I just have to pick up and follow. It took me three years to make some friends at our last spot and at that point we had to move again. We moved to a place that is too big to have a real sense of community and too small to have anything going on. And it sounds very similar to where you are in terms of landscape (aka the most exciting thing about the view is how much sky you can see).

We *just* moved. So creeping Meetup and scouring Facebook groups has also been a part time job for me. I dont have the added barrier of being in a same-sex relationship. But I learned from our last move that you have to make the place you live suit you. And you *cannot* get stuck in the trap of ""X location is so much better."" I've lived in 5 places in 12 years. Where you live does not determine happiness. Attitude does. If you've decided your wife's hometown is *the worst* you won't be happy ever. Not until you can see the good. Or be the good.

Personally, I am a big fan of libraries. Even the small rural communities are usually connected to major ones so you can do inter-library loans and access great online resources including courses. I taught myself how to garden through our local library. Also learned how to make sourdough bread and homemade cheese (I like to bake/cook). 

In my experience, in small communities it's usually easier to find space for things. Like the schools usually have ""community use agreements"" etc. If you are interested in anything like knitting/playing cards/board games you *could* take it upon yourself to host. It doesn't have to be complicated. Just see if you can get a classroom in the evening and invite people to bring their own coffee/tea and put up posters.  It sounds like you are going to be in this community for the long haul, so think about what you want to have and try to start it (I know what I'm suggesting, I'm currently working up the cajones to approach my local recreation commission about hosting a casual playgroup).

Also... don't underestimate your wife's existing social network. Exploit the hell outta that lol. Surely your wife knows some folks you get along with. Even if it's just people to invite over for an afternoon.

Do you get snow where you live? I saw you like skating... x-country skiing might be worth trying out if you don't have access to a rink/pond but still get snow. I was a figure skater and enjoy x-country skiing, I find there is a surprising amount of skill cross over. And the workout is killer.

Edited to Add: you're also going to have to watch your attitude in public. I grew up in a tiny, remote spot and I can promise you that people are suspicious of outsiders and if they get a whiff of that ""trash fire state"" condescension you'll be iced right out.

edited 2: I'm wondering how long you have been there? I've found that it takes more than a year to really feel settled and get past homesickness/culture shock. That might be part of it too depending on how long since you moved"
My first though was why didnt your husband go with you to help your sister...
"I think you need to look at this concretely rather than a vague ""debt is crippling and she has debt."" What does the repayment actually look like? Are these mostly federal loans? What does income-driven repayment look like for her? Does she or could she qualify for public service loan forgiveness? Will this ACTUALLY prevent you from having a house, a kid, and retirement? If it turns out it won't tank your plans, can you get over your dread of debt, or will it always just hang there for you? (Also maybe find out why the amount is that high? I went to an expensive law school in a very high COL area and that and my undergrad loans combined are 1/3 of hers. I'm not saying it's impossible - don't go in all ""That's not what law school costs!"" But I think it's be worth understanding why the total is the total). 

In short, I think you'll get your answer by figuring out the reality of the situation in more detail than simply how much she owes."
"Old lady here co-signing the above comments. Never ever ever put up with any bullshit from a man, they are a dime a dozen. Dump him. As Ms Grande says Thank u, next "
"She doesn’t have to approve of it for you to buy it. When she voices her opinion, just say, “Yeah, but I really like it and have ordered it.  Thanks for the great Christmas present!”  Stand up for yourself. Your parents will not always approve of your decisions, and this one is pretty inconsequential. 

If she’s making it too much of a pain, the yes, just give the money back to her. "
"Absolutely confront X and hear his side of the story first, in person. If there was even a little bit emotional cheating there (even if they stopped on time), you have an answer and it might be time to break up, as this is leading to a full blown cheat in the future tbh. 

There is too much tolerance here from your side. Personally I would not be comfortable with my bf being/sleeping/hanging out so much with another woman while there is so much history and chemistry going on. Idc how much money that saves us.

It is time to decide what you want and what he offers to be with you. If he chooses you, he must stop being in these dangerous situations and end it with the other girl. "
"&gt;He then smashed up the house and I ended up in hosptial with a lacerated hand that I then needed surgery for.

Hey so can you elaborate on how you ""ended up"" with a lacerated hand? "
"This. Just say this. 

Boofuckinghoo."
"I would have dumped the cake on the kitchen floor and left. Boy, bye."
"Exactly. When my then-fiance's stepfather's sister gave me a pair of earrings for Christmas (and my ears have never been pierced), I was grateful that she thought of getting me anything at all. If those had come from my husband, though, that would be a bad present, and it would have been totally fair for me to be upset about it."
I don't understand why you didn't leave him like 4 and a 1/2 years ago.
"Turn a radio on to a station that only plays white noise, and play it at a medium level. That should help drown out a little of the singing. 

She is obviously very happy that you are home. "
Please get out of there as soon as you can. He is just beginning a really abusive pattern that u are able to avoid completely right now. You should not ever have to fear your significant other. There’s nothing to mend. I know it’s hard to hear. But run as fast as u can in the opposite direction of this man. 
"The act is called 'stealthing' and he violated your conditional consent. There are some places where that is a criminal act.

What he did was a type of assault, and he did it *twice*. There's no coming back from that and you did a brilliant job at upholding your boundaries. 

Do not give him any more chances. This guy does not respect you and is not to be trusted."
"You're definitely pulling your weight. Also, it sounds like maybe you two do need to renegotiate parental duties a bit, since neither of you are happy with the status quo. Go in ready to talk about what you need and listen to what she needs, without being married to a specific solution. "
"My ex wife's mother was exactly like this. Her mother was so toxic, and my my wife refused to set boundaries, it completely destroyed the marriage. "
"He has some interesting ideas about what your clothing means...it probably says more about *his* ideas about women than yours. If he saw men giving you attention in a mini-skirt, would he want you to stop wearing that too? Does he think you don't know how to deflect unwanted attention?

The fact that he's acting out is a little troubling - does he always sulk when he doesn't get his way? You've said he's great in every other way, but what's he doing to work on that jealousy? People rarely become less jealous and controlling; they usually just become more comfortable expressing that behavior."
Yes document it and tell the hospital staff the truth about how it happened. Get pictures. 
"You don't have to be convincing about the fact that your son doesn't want the role. Just tell her that he didn't audition because he isn't interested in playing a lead and he is happy to participate in a lesser role. If she tries to force the issue, tell her that it's his decision and you support him. Polite but firm. If he comes home saying she's making him play the lead anyway, take it to the administration.

As far as the play, I agree with you that it sounds like an insensitive choice, but I think you're going to be fighting a brick wall if you try and get them to change it since this teacher sounds stubborn and casting has already happened. You can bring up your disappointment, but I wouldn't expect the result to be that they choose a different play."
"The actual issue here is that your adult BF still relies on his mom for basic life things like making appointments.  If his mom had weird expectations and BF wasn't playing into them, there wouldn't be much of an issue, but he's totally playing into them.  Expect that if y'all ever do move far enough away from his family that they can't do everything for him, you'll have to be his new mommy.

EDIT: the bottom line is that your BF doesn't ""have"" to do anything.  He isn't required by law to get his mother's approval or live close to her.  He makes the choice to do those things.  Do you want to be with someone who makes the choices your BF makes?"
"People with autism or PTSD have problems showing their emotions but they have the purest affection when they get to the point of showing them.

Your brother has been through a lot of trauma but he didn’t take you in out of duty or pity, he did what he wanted to do and what he felt like doing it. The gifts for Christmas (even if he asked his sister, at least he cared enough), dinner and attempting to ask you about your day and school are as best as he could do for showing his interest and affection. Just be patient. 

What i would suggest is for you to change your therapist. You need someone for advices but more importantly you need someone who understands your brother’s situation and can help giving you guidelines on how to approach your brother. As a team between you, your sister and a professional therapist, I think you will be able to brake the barriers with him.

P.S: i am calling them sister and brother because they deserve and earned it. "
Gamer checking in too. I drop everything whenever I hear my kid whine/cry while in game. PUBG 3rd/4th circle? Forget it. I'm proning in the field and the other team can have my loot. My kid's crackers are worth more.
"Want to know why those guys who are 33 and making their first MLB start are such a big deal? Because it basically never fucking happens. 

If he wants to pursue a baseball career, that’s delusional. If he wants to be part of a baseball team, he can pretty much do that anywhere."
"Completely agree with all of this, especially the edit. 

Try to think of the little things, the familial things he may have missed out on. Whatever family traditions you guys have, make sure he’s involved. Let him warm up and get comfortable, and hopefully it’ll be a really special night for all of you! Merry Christmas!

And please post an update!"
I’d bail. There are plenty of fish in the sea. 
"THIS.    He should have been with you.   He is clearly still in the “me” stage.  As males grow from boys to young men to grown men, they pass thru this stage.  Some males get stuck in the “me” stage for their entire lives.  Other males pass thru this “me” stage and realize that real men take care of their wives and children and share the benefits of the good things that life has to offer but also share the burdens that life places on us sometimes.  Let’s hope your husband passes thru the “me” stage quickly. "
"So, Jay is being held accountable for being a bigot and is trying to blame you because you sorta shifted the group in a way that makes them realize that what he's saying is not okay.

If anything, I think your BF is just growing out of this friendship. If he's becoming less and less tolerant of Jay's comments, that is your BF's decision and there's nothing you can do about it when Jay blames you. Also, I'm glad BF has your back.

Have you talked to BF about how he feels about this friendship?"
Horrible. It is a fact that domestic abuse victims are TEN TIMES more likely to be killed if their abuser has choked them in the past. This guy has a problem
"&gt;fine I’ll never wear anything that belongs to you again.

That seems to be the best solution. There is no way you can allow her to use judgement in when it is too much. You have tried and she goes way beyond the ""cute"" stage of wearing your T-shirt to bed. She wears multiple items several times a day. Plus she is sloppy by throwing them on the floor. So, the best way to handle it is -- you wear your own clothes and I will wear mine.

I think she has a possessive nature and wearing your clothes is her way of say, ""you are mine."""
"Fully agree.

OP titled this “My parents ruined our NYE plans...”, but they didn’t. OP did.

*She* made the decision to tell her parents her travel plans, and *she* made the decision to give into their day-of protests and complaints.

I mean, they’ve been dating 4 years, yet OP still prioritizes her parents’ clingy, selfish wants over her partner and their relationship. And OP even says that as she gets older, she’s wanting to spend *more* time with these controlling, boundary-overstepping parents!

If OP can’t find her spine and start prioritizing her relationship, I’d absolutely support the BF wanting to break up. He deserves a partner who doesn’t cancel their entire NYE plans (after not seeing each other for *months*) just because that partner’s parents told them “no”."
do not have sex with her ever (again)
"I'd tell a drunk driver to go to hell. I hate drunk drivers. A friend of mine lost her legs and a child in a drunk driving accident. Another, his pregnant partner. And he became suicidal. She could have killed people. Ruined lives. She should be begging for your forgiveness, not your compassion."
"Unless he withdrew and spent $30,000 in cash, there are records of what he used his card on.

"“That’s just the way the male body is?!” Oh HELL NO. That’s not a “male body” thing that’s an Asshole thing. I would leave the relationship based on that statement alone. Why do you wanna date/have sex with someone who doesn’t give a crap about making you feel good too? This guy is selfish af,"
"If you’re already finding yourself disgusted by your girlfriend, maybe you should end things before they have a possibility of progressing further."
"&gt;I'm worried that whatever I say, he's going to take it as me being jealous or childish.


Does he often call you jealous or childish when you raise your concerns or feelings to him? "
"Listen to this please OP. Do not go anywhere alone with this man. Do not go to his apartment alone, do not take him anywhere. Call the police and ask them to escort you. Even if you call the roommate, there is no telling what the roommate might say to him, either giving him a heads up or covering for him by saying he's home alone when really you're walking into an apartment where your abusive EX is laying in wait.

Please, call the police and ask them. Tell them you are trying to get out of an abusive situation and I promise you, they will help or at least give you resources on who can help. A lot of DV shelters also have guards who can help you extricate yourself from this situation.

Then you need to speak to a counselor, you may not realize it now, but there will come a day when you will have to come to terms with the fact that you survived this, and that day will require a lot of tools you can get from going to see someone and talking. A lot of schools, shelters, and hospitals can help set you up with someone if you cannot afford or lack a starting point. 

Please be safe OP."
"It's not your responsibility to give up the prime years of your life to be a caretaker. It may be something you accept, but you can stop accepting it. My brother and I both had this conversation -- what to do about a crazy mother -- and both decided there wasn't much we could do without basically ending our own lives for an unknown number of years. The end result was that she lived alone.. still crazy.. for quite some time. She did occasionally do stupid things or injure herself but overall she survived, and we went on with living (a very long distance away).

The guilt if you leave may be crippling.. I feel guilt today, long after my mother passed away. But reading what you wrote, it was exactly how I felt: I didn't recognize her anymore, didn't feel I knew this person at all. I feel terrified that someday, somehow, I'll end up becoming like her-- and if I do, I don't want someone wasting their life on me.

If she was ever a different person in the past, it may help you to have an imaginary dialogue with that lost version of your mom, and ask her what she expects or wants from you in this situation."
"Eh the first part I was like ""that's valid, some people want a partner who shares their big interest"" - my boyfriend and I got together because we're both fanatical about the same sports team and it's really great because if I weren't into them, him insisting on being home for every single game even when they play 3-4 times a week would probably be really annoying.  But I'm equally insistent on being home to watch them so instead it's awesome.

But the blow job thing - I'm pretty sure this guy is just a jerk.  I don't think there's anything wrong with not enjoying going down on people but I don't think it's at all fair to still expect them to go down on you. "
"I don’t think your boyfriend likes you. Or does not want to be with you so is justifying why.  But he doesn’t have to. It only takes one person to want to break up to break up. 

And he won’t reciprocate in bed? Ugh. Stop trying to hold onto this guy. He is so not worth it.

By the way, I disagree on your take on men and women being fundamentally different (and also as a woman who does not like rom coms, shopping, and wears a minimum amount to no makeup). My husband and I both like the things we like, and don’t categorize them as “masculine” or “feminine”."
"Uh, you didn't just ""develop crushes"", you actively tried to get with both these guys. One touched your chest and the other rebuffed you, implying you made a move. I don't think this guy is for you, but also you should spend some time working on yourself and introspecting as to why you're cheating. "
"So here’s some questions:  Has your father told the rest of your family about your grandmother’s dementia? Has your father admitted to you and your family that you were right when you were 16?  Has he apologized to you personally for his actions because he believed your grandmother over his own child?  And most importantly, have you asked your father to back you up if the rest of your family starts acting shitty, and has he agreed?  If the answer to every single one of these questions isn’t “yes”, tell your father that these are the conditions he has to meet before you agree to visit her."
"Your parents treated her terribly. I really hope you came to her defense because the things they said to her were totally unacceptable.

Your job right now should not be trying to convince her to give them a chance - because she did. She gave them a chance, and they spent those chances hurting her.

Grow a spine, tell your parents that they were totally unacceptable, and let your girlfriend know that you are not going to stand for that kind of treatment."
"He bought the gift for himself. He's flipping it back around on you, because he knows it was a shitty gift, but that everyone is just supposed to be thankful for getting anything at all. He knew he could get that gift for himself, and if you said anything about it, he could pull the ""suburb"" card....there's no way he just pulled that nugget out without planning that discussion. That was all an act."
There is no characteristic could think of that would make this kind of selfishness worth it. This woman is disgusting. 
"When my first marriage was ending, I basically wanted my now ex to tell me our marriage was over.  I was always questioning myself.  It was pretty painful because separating the household and him moving out took far longer than it should have.

I think it was within 24 hours of him being gone that I felt so free.  I mean, of course I felt moments of sadness and sentiment, but the trend was positive from that first night on.  It sounds like you've done what you can to save the marriage and it's time to look at other options."
"I guess my question is like... What can the institution of marriage offer you if you are not romantically involved with one another? If you choose to move forward with a relationship where both of you are free to live your truths re: sexual orientation (because no one deserves to feel like they're betraying themselves to fit into a specific box), what is the function of keeping the marriage in tact? Two people can be excellent friends, companions, co-parents  without having the label of ""marriage"" on it.

Not looking for an answer, because you can't know that yet. Just think about it.

However, if you intend to continue living as you currently live, with the exception of sex/romance (assuming you two pursue other sexual or romantic relationships), you certainly aren't the first folks to do it. Many people have ""open"" marriages. Its definitely something to do research on as its own thing though. There are lots of nuances. 

There are LGBTQ+ counselors that may be able to help you two meaningfully navigate this situation. Figuring this out will definitely be a process but it helps to have someone who can ask meaningful questions and guide you as needed."
"I think it's fine to have different values and be more conservative towards sex, promiscuity is fine but it isn't something everyone is on board with and that's ok, I personally wouldn't date someone with an extensive sexual history either. What isn't ok is treating her like she's less of a person or less deserving of respect and decency. She made choices you disapprove of, that's it. There's nothing objectively wrong about her behavior, it's alright to just say ""I just don't feel like we're compatible"" without putting someone down.

Your responsibility is not to be with someone you don't respect just because you want to keep loneliness at bay. Ask yourself if you think she'd want to be with a guy who doesn't respect her, she probably wouldn't. The right thing to do is end this, whether it's casual or not. And I must say, I find it a bit odd you're not a fan of her having slept around but seem perfectly fine with the idea of her casually hooking up with you. Doesn't that put you in the same boat?"

Thank you, that phrase really bothered me too. ""She was really beautiful, what could I do?"" I guess we should just lock him up for public safety if he's so easily controlled by a babe. Wouldn't want him to be \*forced\* to do anything against his will again, would we?"

This is so great. Thank you!

"Run. Just run. This is a massive red flag. Massive. 

I've probably legit pissed my husband off sometime over the last 14 years and he has NEVER spoken to me like that.  

This is manipulative and abusive behavior. at your age..2 years seems long but it isnt. Please get out. "
"This woman is so toxic and self absorbed it’s painful to see. From dumping you and telling you months later that you shouldn’t be over her, to blowing up at you for being a good father?? 

take all the time you need getting over her manipulative ass, but cut contact IMMEDIATELY. 

Never apologise for putting your children first, and don’t think about trying to love someone who always drags you down and leaves you in moments of vulnerability.  

She just wants your attention and nothing more. And even if you were childless, she’d rot your life from inside out then too. "
"Out of curiosity, have you ever bluntly laid out what you wrote right here to him. Exactly like this? "
"This is a huge financial infidelity. He could have funded college funds for your kids or put money aside for an emergency fund (like a responsible parent). Either way he lied about the money. He had no intention of sharing it with you, his wife. He could have taken the family on a trip to fricken Disney world. Is he always this selfish? This would be relationship ending for me because I know the first thing I would do if I got 35k would be to run home to the people I love to share my good news and plan all the ways we could share it together. I wouldn't want to be with someone who didn't feel that way about me too."
"&gt; How can I bring this up with my partner without sounding as mad as I feel?

This part made me the saddest. You owe this guy exactly as much emotional labor as he's spending on you.

By that I mean, is he posting on reddit, ""My girlfriend has vaginal health issues, which mean I can't always get my dick off the exact way I want to. She's willing to have other kinds of sex, but god damn it that's just not good enough. How can I let her know how upset this makes me, but like, without being too hard on her?""

No, and not just because he'd get ripped an assortment of new assholes if he did. He's just letting his dick sadness pour out freely, ruining entire days and plans without one tenth of the introspection you're putting into this.

So, be mad. Don't hulk out, but don't try to hide the fact that you have emotions. There's room in the reasonable discussion you want to have for ""I am feeling angry about this,"" because that is a 100% reasonable reaction to the way he's treating you."
"I would not do or say anything that implies you've read the journal. That will make things much worse. If you can get away with it, I would try and express how much you appreciate her and what she's done for you. Also your father's drinking has clearly affected you in the past as well, so if you ever decide to take issue with it, you do have the right to."
"Honestly, after reading your post and comments, you might want to get checked for thyroid issues. Also, sometimes depression doesn't necessarily feel like what you consider it to be. I'd go to the doc. Better to be safe than sorry."
"&gt;Supposedly in a committed relationship to you.

&gt;Insists on keeping an app specifically to meet sexual and romantic partners.

Deleting it isn't a big deal, you can make a new account in a handful of clicks. The fact that it's a big deal to him, means that you aren't as big a deal to him as you ought to be."
"Because life isn't fair, and it's more important for OP to be in a safe secure environment than to drag this out over who ""deserves"" to stay. 

If this is OP's place, then she absolutely should kick him out. But if they both moved in together, or if she's moved into his place, she should cut her losses and just get out. "

"I was going to post there are no happy endings here. It’s either unbelievably selfish, or something much worse. "
"Call CPS and report it. Hell, bring it up to the hospital staff. Some hospitals test the babies meconium, and it would show up on that. I hope this hospital does because the baby deserves to be far away from that mother. "
"Ah! He’s insisting on proposing because he’s not taking her concerns seriously I guess. It’s that “you should have asked” mentality when partners are shocked that they get divorced because they left dishes by the sink or whatever.

I would tell jen, and otherwise stay out of it. “Change phones” which really means you lost his number (obviously you just blocked or muted it or whatever). Jen is your friend, not him. I’d personally probably just give her a heads up and see what she wants to do. His proposal shouldn’t be a surprise anyway, only the exact timing, so a general “he seemed to mention marriage and I was nervous so thought I’d give you a heads up” is enough. You don’t need to talk about the whole plan he has 

"
"I guess you have to decide if you’re willing to go to jail or not. 

40% of women’s incarceration is due to drug related crimes and a significant portion of those sentences are bc of being in a relationship with a drug dealer but not actually being involved in the drug trade. "
"Wow. 

And you stay with this horrid individual...why?

And before you say “because I don’t want to take his child away from him” think about what you’re exposing that innocent child to by staying."
What does that mean and how do I stop it?
"You find this other person alluring because he is everything that your current boyfriend is not. In addition, you don't really know him and you're probably romanticizing the small amount you actually know about him. In three years time, it's likely you'd feel the same boredom and familiarity with the new guy.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're not happy with your current boyfriend, you need to decide whether this is something you can resolve. It is far easier to do this without external influences such as crushes, and it means that you can be confident of your decision. Leaving a partner for somebody else is taking a huge risk and it's likely that if your new relationship fails, you will be left with a heavy sense of ""what if"", which could lead you back to your previous relationship for the wrong reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Take some time out (and away from your friend) to really analyse what is going on in your current relationship. Look at what you like, what you don't like, what you can change and what is likely to stay the same, then ask yourself if it's sustainable. If it isn't, and you can say this honestly without thinking of the other guy or comparing him to your boyfriend, it's quite clear that you're not happy. If you can't do this objectively, you might just be enamored by new guy."
"I checked, and her benefits would start right away. I won’t get paternity leave since I haven’t worked for the company for 12 months yet, but she’d be fine."
"I don't know if anyone has mentioned this,

&amp;#x200B;

but just tell her, ""The difference between the wedding and now, is that you didn't show the tape"". Explain to her the huge difference between revealing the tape and tell her that you destroyed the tape originally for the same reason and she shouldn't have gone behind your back and fixed it. Especially since it still to this day makes you feel uncomfortable, tell your mom that this is just a childhood memory you'd like dead and would prefer she let it go too. You have control over this situation, you just have to speak out about it and don't let her insistence win. You don't like it, it hurts you, it makes your uncomfortable, she needs to stop."
I’d just cut her off and tell the truth when anyone asks why. Don’t try to explain your view or fix her. 
I can think of 100 worse case scenarios!!
"I say phone and thank them again — have chit chat and see if they drop some clues.   Don’t tell them he left though 

EDIT - check your finances and see where money is coming from your account.  He must have debuted or charged something.  "
"You said in the comments that your boyfriend doesn't work, so having a police escort there to supervise as you pack up your things might be what you have to do. He already knows you want out of this relationship, and he is probably counting on you wanting to ""sneak away"" and move out with your things when he isn't home-- I am thinking he will not give you much alone time, if at all, to prevent you from the opportunity of leaving without confrontation.


And the fact that he escalated and physically pushed you down to prevent you from leaving further  illustrates that you should have police intervention. In another comment you mentioned that he threw your phone out of your hands when you told him that you wanted to call the cops. He tried to destroy your property and make it physically impossible for you to call for help-- someone who prevents you from calling the police DESERVE to have the police called on them. He is in the wrong when it came to his abusive behavior and he KNOWS it. He knew if police showed up that things would not work out in his favor and how he wants them; he knows his actions are wrong because he would have been punished/received negative consequences if you were successful in contacting the police.  I just think that is all the proof you need that police protection is probably necessary."
"Absolutely do not do it slowly. You need to move out as quickly as possible, and ensure you have proper support. If possible hire some big moving guys to take your stuff in and out of the house. Make sure that you have people around you and don't get caught alone.

If you have large friends, ask them over to help. The goal here is to have so many big people around that he doesn't even think about trying something.

Also, connect with a domestic violence agency and get assistance and advice on how to protect yourself after you move out.
"
"You aren't being unreasonable, neither is he. You just aren't compatible. Don't give up life experiences for a boyfriend, you'll always wonder what could have been.

I wouldn't try long distance but it's up to you if and when to end it. But realistically, you don't enjoy the idea, you are leaving, he may never want to leave, you may never want to go back. Where does that get you as a couple?"
"She's definitely the side chick.

You can voice your concerns, but in my experience most people don't want to listen to criticism when they're infatuated with someone they're dating. The best you can do is be there for her when this eventually implodes."
"What did you want for Christmas? Buy it and give it to him as a gift.

He bought the sound bar bc he wanted it-if it was only to listen to music like you used to he would have mentioned that when he gave it to you.

Stop apologizing. He is deflecting bc he is guilty. Return the sound bar and get something you want."
She just wants some space. But I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. There have been  other things that have happened the last few Months that I have been red flags that iv ignored and told. My self I was being overly sensitive. But now I see them in a different light I guess 
"Just tell him.  It isn’t your responsibility to manage his reaction. It is considerate of you to be thinking of your partner since this issue impacts him, but ultimately like you mentioned, it is your issue to face, and his reaction shouldn’t be an additional burden. 

It’s not like you’re being cold or withholding sex as a punishment, you have medical issues you’re working on. If he had ED, would you be complaining while he worked on finding a solution? 

I think you just need to tell him what you explained here. None of what you’ve said sounds irrational. Good luck!"
"He really came at you with this?

&gt; I want to do everything in my power to make you feel good

Aside from, ya know, making sure you're comfortable by doing what you ask consistently and without qualification.

You should be very proud of yourself, seriously. "
You have some sex negative attitudes you should work on. Sex isn't intrinsically wrong if it has no emotional significance. You didn't do anything wrong and shouldn't feel bad. 
"Yeah, agreed. The Lying for attention is more than just hurt feelings. Also, I wanted to reiterate that it’s totally normal and acceptable to want to spend some time just with your husband on Christmas, which incidentally you won’t have another chance to do, though I’m sure your baby will only add more joy to the season. My step sister is engaged this year and she and her fiancé chose to spend both Thanksgiving and Christmas just the two of them. They saw my parents the day after, and I sent my gifts along with them. No one made a fuss, and we still had a perfectly fine holiday knowing they were doing the same. "
"I don’t think he’s dense at all.  IMO, he’s deliberately doing his because then he can keep riding the gravy train. "
"I feel like the anime girls are actually just a side note, what concerns me most is that he keeps on talking about how hot other girls are despite you explicitly telling him that you do not wish to hear things like that.

It seems that he doesn't respect you very much, are there other incidents like that?"
"I had a boyfriend who had a fetish for receiving golden showers and of me talking as if I was banging a bunch of other guys because he didn't satisfy me. I couldn't do either of these things, and he was **obsessive**. He couldn't get off unless he talked about the second thing, and he constantly tried to make me feel bad for not doing the first thing. I ended up not wanting to have sex with him at all, ever. Which of course he tried to make me feel bad about.

If the fetish is something you can't try for him and if he is making an issue of it, it's 100% a valid reason to end things. "
"I’m 22 and just started my first “real” job last year. I’ve found it helps to avoid sitting down when you get home. Don’t take the time to rest, just start doing what you want to do. "
"Yes thank you for this reply! And I definitely tried to give him alternatives for the condom, especially oral. He just wasn’t quite as interested. He could keep putting the focus back on me and then wouldn’t really answer my questions about what he would like, etc. 

And I definitely agree about the actions part, thank you that makes me feel better!"
"Yeah he stood up for me at the bonfire and so did Jays wife. He does call him out when he says something offensive which I THINK is a big reason Jay hates me. I think before I came along, Nate would let some comments slide but since dating me he doesn’t anymore. "
"He's already cheating on you right now, he just wants a couple of weeks where he can be lazy about not having to lie about where he is. 

You really wanna be alone legally trapped with someone who treats you like a doormat? Because I guarantee, you're getting wifed up because you're the one he can wipe his feet on at home. "
"He's really funny and he's a great listener, we have a lot of fun together. This behavior started fairly recently and until it started I genuinely thought he was the one. Now I'm not sure."
The fact they have kids though and are paycheck to paycheck that bothers me. They don't seem to have any community property to speak of as far as actual money goes. Him claiming he spent it already is suspicious af given their situation in that regard.
"My mum once told me about a gift her ex husband got her for her birthday, which was just before xmas. He made a huge deal about this ""amazing"" gift he got her... it was an outboard motor for a boat. He was horribly offended when she wasn't thrilled about it, and made her out to be a greedy gold-digger. For xmas he did the same song &amp; dance.. her ""gift"" was a boat.

She had zero interest in boating, actually couldn't swim so was a bit afraid of it. But he'd been talking about it all year. He just used her birthday and xmas to buy himself a boat.

They got divorced a year later.

Your BF is emotionally manipulating and abusing you. He also doesn't respect you and thinks of you as beneath him.

""he also said it’s the most fucked up thing anyone has ever said to him. "" - well, that sounds shockingly fragile and sheltered, if the WORST thing anyone has ever said to him is ""I don't like the gift"".

I know you like the guy, but he is not worth it. He's awful, he's already done damage to you, if you stay with him, he's going to do so much more. He will crush you emotionally and mentally. You deserve SO much better."
"&gt; OPs gf not taking responsibility for her actions and showing remorse is not acceptable in my opinion

This is really what it comes down to. Everyone makes mistakes but good people take responsibility"
And her brother is 16! WAYYY to young to handle this by himself 
"I don't think so, we don't normally assign blame for accidents"
"""our friend came down to spend New year's with the two of us. You are wanting to break our plans to make new plans without us. I'm sure if our friend had know you were going to ditch us on New year's Eve they would have made other arrangements. You made a commitment to spent this time with us and you need to honor that."" 

You don't bail on a guest who travels to see you. Completely unacceptable. "
"At this point I'm just super confused though - if he stepped up for everything else when you were sick, why is the dog so hard for him?

If it's literally just the dog, I would like to suggest sitting him down and having one last come-to-Jesus talk (at a time when you haven't asked him to do dog related stuff) about why he's massively dropping the ball here, but if he can't or won't answer, then you know what to do."
"It sounds like even if you DO stay with him you won’t be able to have the family that you’re dreaming of — he sounds like he might not be able to take on a father role, and that he is barely able to take care of himself.  "
"You might not know for sure how he feels about you, but you now know that he's the kind of guy who has no problem telling his friends he doesn't love you and also making you sound pathetic to them. That's a massive lack of respect that I'd dump someone over in a hot minute. "
"&gt;He constantly lies to me about who he is with or where he is at, when I call him out on it he says hes going to leave

&gt;He has cheated a lot, more than I should take but it is just so hard for me to leave or not plead with him to stay.

This will only get worse after the wedding.

Do you really want to spend the rest of your life like this?"
"She obviously didn't want to go, she wanted to spend time with her family but you were guilting her about it so she didn't feel like she could just say no. It's not the end of the world that you spent Christmas with your respective families. I wouldn't want to do that much driving on Christmas either "
I found out my fiance (then boyfriend) got accepted to college through Facebook. He was more excited to tell everyone else before calling/texting me. Probably the same feelings I had. 
"I’d leave out the part about it having changed since she was a kid. That gives the impression that those things somehow didn’t used to be manipulative, when in fact they’ve always been a terrible alternative to communication and respect-based relationships."
"Yeah, I will definitely do that. Thank you."
"She's a clean freak but throws your clothes (not hers) on the floor?  No, she just treats your items like crap.       

If she keeps insisting that she didn't wear your clothes that much, ask her what outfits she wore that day and the day before and then extrapolate that number into items per week.

Just tell her that your clothes are off limits, period.  And BTW, I'm female and consider her behavior out of line. "
"What about #6? She identifies as gay sexually, but what about romantically? That part left me confused, is there any expectation that OP and his wife will be in a romantic relationship where you will be going on dates and still exchange ""I love you""' 's or will they transition to just platonic friends? My doubt is due to the framing of ""perfect life partner, except for sex"", it seems that there is a romantic expectation there from OP, but I'm pretty confused.

For example, I find both genders attractive sexually, but in romantic terms, I only am attracted to one. So, I suppose it might vary from person to person, I don't know if she still considers OP a romantic partner."
"Obviously I don’t know, but I would figure that the cousin had no idea the husband hid the inheritance. Just like most of the commenters here, the cousin probably didn’t even question if the husband had told OP or not, they couldn’t imagine someone keeping that a secret so it didn’t occur to them that asking would be a big deal."
"Do. Not. Have. Sex. With. Her. 

Run. Run so fast. This isn't a healthy relationship, at all. "
You could skip out right now. This doesn't sound healthy 
"""Personally I can never date someone I don't respect. And I wouldn't be able to respect someone like her.""

Most sensible thing written here. OP, break up with her next time you see her. Years from now you will be happy with somebody you love &amp; respect, look back and shutter, realizing the bullet you were able to dodge."
"Why waste the cake? I would take it home and eat it all for myself. 
"
"OP, look up ‘manic pixy dream girl’. This is your boyfriend’s perspective of you. He’s not in love with you, he’s in love with the idea of you. "
TIL only wives share food. Your ex sounds nuts. 
"He knows you're sick. How the fuck could he *not* know that you're sick?

He doesn't care.

So...what do you think you should do with this?"
"If what you say is true you're not overreacting.

I don't get when people get shocked when someone decides to step up and make their perfectly reasonable boundaries clear. "
"Oh wait, it’s a female friend?! Um, you are being WAY restrained right now. You officially have permission to utterly lose your shit. "
"I'd, calmly, explain to your in-laws, ""Look, I do not want to be around her while pregnant and I definitely *do not* want to subject our future childre  to that level of volatile instability. To be perfectly blunt with you I can't say with absolute certainty that she won't become violent at some point and end up hurting someone, like actually phyically hurting them. If she is around I will not be, and that includes the babies.""

Your husband is on your side. They can come *visit you* instead of you visiting them. Sandy should not be allowed near you (or they children) *at all*."
"A roommate and I were each giving our rent money to my bf, and it turned out he was using the rent money to pay his car payment and his credit cards, not the rent. Came home one day to an eviction notice."
"Listen. He hasn't married you, cheats, abandoned you on vacation, tore up the house, told you he doesn't want to be with you twice, and you're trying to get pregnant? Give your fucking head a shake!! "
"If I were OP, I'd wait until after the first trimester when the risk of miscarriage goes way down, honestly.

I miscarried just a couple of days before Christmas and it has been so difficult to talk about and deal with, and that was with my parents (and my husband's) being 100% supportive and completely lovely. I would not trust OPs mom to deal if things go wrong. 

Edit: That being said, I'm not trying to put a damper on what I'm sure is a very happy time, OP. I hope your morning sickness is light and your child is healthy ❤️"
"You’re the first STEM person on Reddit I’ve seen not just ourtright attack arts people when the subject is brought up.

You’re a good person, good person."
"Right? If I had this emergency, my husband would have brought Christmas to me and my family, and I would have done the same for him. That's what partners do!"
"Whilst maybe he didn't 'physically' cheat on his ex, he definitely 'emotionally' cheated on her. In fact, I would say he was playing you both in the between period. 

Personally, I wouldn't trust a dude that does that, also the fact that he can say something as ""I would like to marry you someday..."" to both of you makes me think, he probably can't. "
"&gt;Initially I thought this issue was petulant and infantile given our age and was surprised he felt emasculated 

why just 'initially'? Yes, he is absolutely being petulant and infantile. 

&gt;he has also be miffed about earning less than me and constantly assumes I will do house chores. He also doesn’t like working out with me and has stopped pulling his weight with cooking and house admin.

yeah fuck ALLLLLLLLLLLL of that. I'm with u/FionaIsDope."
"I could not pick out a cashmere sweater from a plain wool, wool blend or synthetic. These days they make the synthetics really soft. If the people you are around do not know the difference I doubt they would call you out on it. Besides you could have gotten them second hand for $5.

Do wear them. They are gifts and beautiful. You are a considerate person to consider people you come in contact with. But I think you should enjoy the sweaters without guilt."
I hope your Gf has a stake in that house in the will. Paying somebody else's mortgage for living in their house isn't a fair trade at all. None of the upside of equity and all the down side of cost and maintenence. 
"&gt; Typically he says things about divorce when I do over hear him though. (One time I didn’t do something right and as he was putting our son in the car he said to him “I’m divorcing mommy anyways” he didnt know I overheard.)

This is abusive and appalling to say to your child."
"He is acting like a child, and is completely out of line. He is also potentially dangerous, since he threatened you. Several bright red flags:

- “My” child - I’m sorry, what? I don’t even understand what he is implying by saying that to the child’s mother. Not only does the sentiment itself not make sense (you whispered, and your child is a baby, and respectful flirting between adults in a relationship is just about the least exciting thing in the world), but making it about *his* child when talking to *you* is just bizarre to me. 

- “Something [he] might regret” - to me, this sounds like a threat. When he eventually comes home you need to sort this out and make it clear that this is absolutely unacceptable behavior, and you will not be with someone who threatens violence when you don’t put out. Better yet, could you stay with someone for a few days or weeks? This man is erratic and dangerous. 

Ideally, you would discuss this problem with a neutral third party present, like a therapist, because *he threatened you with violence when you didn’t have sex with him.* Most people with that kind of temper don’t respond well to being called on their bullshit, and someone else being there to mediate could be extremely valuable. 

- he stormed out, didn’t answer the phone, and basically abandoned his wife and baby. 

I worry for your safety when he returns. Please stay with someone you trust, if possible, until all this is completely sorted out. Threats are not ok. Please don’t let him sweep this under the rug. "
"yup, I guess I'm looking for sympathy slash to be told I'm not crazy to be wanting out of my marriage over this.

&amp;#x200B;

Single parenthood is not easy, so I don't want to have second thoughts or regrets about pulling the trigger. I keep wondering what else I should do or if I am too demanding."
"This is absolutely true.

OP, this isn't on you.  This isn't because you didn't compliment him enough or make him feel ""sexy"" or ""attractive"" enough.  This is something within himself that cannot be fixed with simple compliments from the SO. 

 This is something that requires a professional's help, as if it is BDD, he will never see himself as *adequate,* let alone attractive, no matter how many dangerous medications and procedures he seeks out."
"So the bigger problem is that you’re dating someone who doesn’t respect your wishes or possessions, wants you to do the laundry she creates, and makes you feel bad when you asking for a reasonable compromise. Your other comments also make it sound like you have to walk on eggshells around her. 

I urge you to evaluate if you really think she has the maturity, self-awareness, and selflessness to sustain an adult relationship at this point in time. It sounds like she has much more growing to do before she is ready for that since relationships are primarily about compromise and she refuses to compromise on even this small issue."
"Your feelings are totally justified. Your husband was inconsiderate and also weirdly exclusionary. It should've been his first thought to call you up, especially in the 2nd example when his brothers started calling their partners and he knew you were just sitting at home by yourself.

I'd want to know why exactly he didn't ""think about it."" That's weird. Everyone else is phoning their wives and he's just there twiddling his thumbs? What's the deal? I seriously doubt he's that dense and feel there might be something else going on, unless they were already en route to the place and his brothers made phone calls when he wasn't present.

Has this been an issue in other aspects of your relationship, where he leaves you out of things? Do you guys normally have dates together that don't get cancelled at the last minute? Does he usually stay in touch over phone/text? If the answers to those questions are positive, maybe he really was just swept up in being with family and had a couple stupid days. But if this is part of a larger pattern, he needs to make the effort to be more accommodating."
"The New Years night itself does not seem to be the true issue for you. You say sometimes you think you’ll “never be the most important to him”. The question is: does he show you in other ways how important you are to him? Is he capable of compromising on other matters? If you are feeling like a back up option to his family and other priorities, let him know clearly and firmly. If he’s unwilling to change, you must be willing to leave. Hope this helps!"
"It means he enjoys your company, was sexually satisfied and is treating you with respect like a decent adult male would. "
Yeah someone is immature enough to want to be a parent at 17 is definitely immature enough to lie about birth control. Do not have sex with her. Don’t even get close.
"Yup. He says this is what it takes to start a new business and that it's too much work to travel with a kid and that's it, no discussion. he denies that he could work less even if he admits a lot of it is youtube and reading the news."
"This is an interesting idea in theory, but would be awful for OP in practice.

The police will ask her to take a rape kit, which involved medical professionals scraping the walls of her vagina. She will be asked invasive, demeaning questions by the police (if they even take the claim seriously).

There is no upside for OP in this - even if it’s successful in outing the brother’s lie, it means that OP has to go through a dehumanizing experience just for the chance at keeping a man who loses all trust in her at the least provocation."
"Every time I’ve tolerated crap Iike this I’ve massively regretted it later.

You can’t control his behavior, but you can control yours.

I advise that you don’t stay with someone who shows so little respect for your relationship, and/or allows other people to disrespect you and your relationship. The fact that he hid this from you shows you that he already knows that it’s wrong, but made an intentional choice to continue anyway.

&gt; We have always been open and honest with each other.

Not true."
This an abusive relationship. Do your parents know what was going on last night? He said you could come home? I have some advice and I know you won’t listen. Get out now. 
"It sounds like he wants you to feel bad about yourself. Probably because he feels bad about himself, and thinks that if he makes sure your self-esteem is low too, then you won't leave him. 

That's *textbook* emotional abuse. Do you want your child to grow up thinking that's what a romantic relationship is supposed to look like? 

You can't make him change. Only he can do that. But what you can do is remove yourself from his sphere of influence. That can mean walking out of the room when he's being mean, or walking out of the relationship entirely. It's entirely up to you. "
"Do you feel like your dad can be trusted with this information? Is he more stable than your mother? I would approach him for help and see if you can get out of there, your safety is most important and you should not stay if you can leave. I understand the hesitation to report this incident to the police, but at least get out of there. "
"Funny how this response was the hardest to read, but the most helpful.  Thank you. "
"I wouldn't. What kind of person goes behind their girlfriend's back to make her look pathetic to others? Whether it was a lie or some version of the truth in his eyes, it was so slimy for him to be in there degrading her value while she was in the kitchen doing nice things for him. At the age of 15 this would be a crappy and weird move. At 23 it's a seriously repulsive character flaw."
Yea I don’t think OP has all the details from the bf.
"Yeah, and if you got back with him he'd start regressing again as soon as he felt comfortable. He only did it to make you stay, not to make you happy. Still selfish"
"Go for it.  Just don't expect to be thanked, or believed, or for the experience to be in any way positive for you.  

The best case scenario you can reasonably expect is a quick ""fuck you, I'm not going to let some random from the internet ruin my marriage."" It is more likely to be much worse."
"I think that, if you were to explain to them that you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in your mother's home, they may change their tune. Its likely your safety is of the utmost importance to them and they would make accommodations for you if they knew you were unsafe."
"I spent 3+ years with a partner who has depression and possibly bipolar disorder. They were hard, trying years. I'm sure you can imagine.

Leaving him was SO hard. He was my best friend in the world. When I left, I felt so guilty that I would feel sick and panicky when I thought of it, and I would have to go on walks to clear my head. This lasted a while. One of the tougher emotional battles I have ever faced.

But now, years later, I can say wholeheartedly that yes, it was awful, but it was absolutely the right choice. I am happy now. I have a partner who completes me. And my ex? We are still friends, but his issues are still not treated. I give him advice (to see a doctor and a therapist) and he mostly does not take it. And that still hurts, to see him suffer, but when I support him, it is as a friend. My life is not tied to him and his illnesses that he won't treat. My life belongs with another person, a person who will go to the doctor when they need to, a person who understands my previous battles, and knows why I feel the way I do.

Let yourself grieve. It is hard to leave a person you love. But you will also thank yourself some day in the future, because at the end of the day, the only person whose happiness you can take responsibility for is you. "
You'll do great. He'll remember this.

"Nobody ever realizes that they have an accent until someone points it out. Honestly, even people who grow up around people that speak a dominant foreign language in the household have accents despite being born and raised in America.

But at this point, I get where he's coming from. You probably don't see it because you're white, but there is something very off putting about people asking ""where are you from"" all the time. I do think he's interpreting the situation to be much more intricate than what it is, but he has a point on the racism part.

Accent or no accent, it'd be better off in people not asking that - even if its just for conversation. There's a lot to cover between an American identity vs. foreign identity, expectations, etc, that I do not have the energy to cover but the best way to resolve this issue is probably to apologize.

Is it silly? Yeah, a bit even though there's a point to it. But it means a lot to him. So what's more important, being right or acknowledging how he is being hurt?

So, if you decide to apologize you can say that you and your family didn't understand that this was hurting him and that you will do what you can to prevent it from happening again. And that you're sorry, it took you some time to realize this because there is a racial divide, but it was never your intention to hurt him or for others to hurt him.

If you think it'd help, your family could apologize too for not realizing that it was affecting him.

At this point though, since it seems most of the family friends have met him, there shouldn't be another mishap with that particular question.

Questions like ""where are you from"" toward a nonwhite person are personal in the sense that many of us have been asked that before and it became a negative thing because of negative experiences that came with that question. Even if it's asked innocently, it still sets me on guard - and I was born and raised in America. I've even had people (who were nice) go so far as to ask ""what's your bloodline though"" because my answer didn't go into my heritage.

In reality, maybe it's not a super form of aggressive racism, but it does fall into the micro aggression category. It's the same as ""what are you"" — which is pretty disrespectful in any context.

As far as the accent itself, I'd drop that part. Yes, he has one and you've just told him that he does - that's it. Whether he accepts that he does or not.

EDIT: also, if you do hear people asking him this question and he replies, but the act the same way as they did at this party, back him up. It's important that you're there for him, even if it seems like a small thing."
"OP says they didn't learn anything, but it should be painfully obvious that the lesson learned is to not go out on more dates with people who act deranged and aggressive. How she entered into a relationship after that first date is terrifying. You have to wonder if it's confidence issues or something. "
"I think there's a big problem here that's easy to miss. OP, why does your mom even know what you're thinking of buying or that you're paying for it with the check she gave you?

It sounds like some boundaries would help a lot here."
"Something similar happened to me. It's so goddamned annoying that they are capable of what you wanted/asked/yearned for.. But they wouldn't do it FOR YOU. Wouldn't do it until THEY were deeply unhappy and disrupted. 

You are worthy of that effort. 

Asking him to be elsewhere is a great plan. Of course you both still care for each other and have shared a lot. But you (both) need some space to rearrange your habits and heal and figure out what comes next.

Reach out to some other people if you can, for company and distraction. Be kind to yourself. Eat, sleep, move in ways that are good for you. The anger is part of healing."
The guy is a piece of crap. He knows exactly what he’s doing. 
"Don't know how close you are to your Aunt and her daughter, but first thing I would do is call animal services and have them check the animals. It's absolutely disgusting that the cat's litter hasn't been cleaned in so long. On top of that, if the floor solution is so strong it leaves your nose burning all day, imagine what it's doing to those animals! 

Regardless of the fact that she is family, you need to get those animals out of that house before they get insanely sick and continue to be neglected! But be prepared for the family fallout if you decide to go that route. 

Good luck!"
Nah. Your MIL only wants you to move in so she can continue to be overbearing and so she can financially benefit from it. Your wife is probably just more used to her bullshit so it's harder for her to go against her mother. But moving out is the right thing to do. 
"Yes because people that honest to god fucked up and are worth staying with:

1) confess right away because they feel overwhelming guilt

2) apologise and never deflect blame because they know it was their doing.

Still a long process to trusting fully after something like this but it’s a good starting point."
"""I left him because he's a disgusting, oily sack of shit who thinks washing his balls once a week entitles him to a blowjob""

Yeah nobody is going to think less of you for breaking up with this guy."
"Two days? And that ""something he'll regret"" line? It is a counseling or divorce scenario because this is not something that should be how you function as a family. Better to find out now if he's able to be mature enough to recognize that this is a problem that needs solving before you're five years down the line &amp; he's going out for a pack of cigarettes forever. "
This is all a part of Alzheimer's. She needs treatment from medical professionals who are trained to deal with outbursts like this. It's going to be hard on everyone but you can't let her complaining manipulate you and your family to take her away from the care she desperately needs.
This is seriously what I needed to hear. I'll be repeating this to myself throughout this haha. Thanks!
"Step 1: bake cookies 
Step 2: dump him 
Step 3: eat cookies 
Result: happiness"
"This is just the baggage of an old lady who is projecting, but the thing that sends up the most red flags to me, is how  he was so eager to admit you are a flake, and had a list of examples waiting for why he thinks that about you.  
Were I you, I would think long and hard about maintaining a relationship with someone who attributes flawed character traits on you so easily.   
If you are such a flake, why does he talk to you about a future together? Especially if he believes it will just fall through?  To me, that makes me think that he either plans to use that as a way to bully you into giving him his way if you guys do get more serious, OR it means that he does not actually have serious feelings for you, but he wants to play with you and have you foot a big part of the bill, until he finds a new host.  


Either way, I think some of his behavior here should send up enough flags that you pump the breaks on moving in with this man, or really having any serious long terms plans for a while."
"This made me tear up. Thank you.

And you're absolutely right about my girl needing time to process it all. I guess with me, in some situations, not knowing the outcome is worse than knowing it. I'm driving myself crazy thinking about her leaving me. I love her a lot and I know I messed up big time by not initially telling her the truth. I know that and I wish I could rewind time and correct it."
i've noticed this is a big problem in a lot of posts here. People will set themselves on fire just to avoid conflict at all costs. 
"I second this.

/u/inaverystrangeplace Right now, you can’t imagine not being together but it’s best for your family unit if you start figuring out how to coparent and separate your lives so there’s room for both of you to explore romantic relationships. Room to eventually become a blended family with new partners.

The enmeshment of continuing on like nothing has changed is deterimental long term because *it’s not sustainable*. At some point, your wife will fall in love with another woman. She will feel things for her that she was never capable of feeling for you. And she will want a life with this person, **which doesn’t work when you are filling the role of spouse/life partner.** So, if you don’t plan ahead this will blow up your family situation in ways that could be very hurtful to you.

* You don’t want to be in a situation where you’re fighting in court over custody. If she is the primary caretaker of the children while you work, a judge could decree you get visitation a couple of weeknights and every other weekend.

* What if she wants to move out of state with her lover? You can’t imagine this now, but if she’s head over heels in love and there’s no prior binding agreement that the kids have to stay put in your current area then she could blindside you with a move *before you have time to petition family court.*

* You love your wife and know her well. But you do not yet know the woman she is when she is in love **and disconnected from you emotionally as a partner**. There will be someone else who will be her priority in making life decisions together with. You can’t see her being selfish or hurtful towards you, but *it’s quite easy for people to justify the things that they want.*

Instead, the best way forward is to acknowledge you will always be a family but remaining married isn’t in the cards. Start making decisions which prepare your kids for divorce and the “new normal”. There’s no need to rush into the living apart, but start discussing how things will work as two households.

* Consider selling your home and looking for a dual residence, whether that’s a duplex or a house that has a fully detached guest suite (one parent can live in the main home and the other has their own space while being close/able to freely spent time with the kids, join for dinner, etc).

* Start separating your finances and working on a budget for shared expenses. Maybe you retain a joint account for child and household bills but open up separate checking, savings, and credit cards.

* When your ready to speak to your kids, reassure them mom and dad love each other and are committed to this family they’ve created but are better as friends than husband and wife. Let them know of your timetables in regards to staying in your home, and decisions to find another home together which better suits the new dynamic of your family. No need to mention your wife’s sexuality.

* Decide what your hard lines are. Maybe the dual residence is workable for 5 years, after which one parent will move out. Or maybe you stay living together until the kids are away to college. How soon are either of you comfortable with new girlfriends being introduced to the kids? (After six months of dating? A year?) Are there any conditions in which either of you are open to relocating as a family?

Bottom line, if you don’t start figuring these things out it’s going to get very messy once new romantic partners are in the mix. Good luck OP!"
"Seriously, the lack of empathy is disturbing."
I don't think anybody here thinks that money is the problem here.
"Have you told your brother that you've noticed that he treats her poorly? If he talks over her, can't you say ""Hey shut up I want to hear what she has to say""?"
"His porn preferences are not the issue here, I would drop that part. But it sounds like he repeatedly crosses boundaries with underage girls, and this is itself is a cause for concern. At the very least you should be on heightened awareness and if anything else seems “off” to you with his behavior toward young girls you need to listen to your instincts."
"You mean ex-partner, right? Because clearly he's not proud of you, doesn't have your back, and isn't going to stand up to family toxicity. This whole situation reeks of dealbreakers, particularly the ""I won't talk about it"" communication style."
That your girlfriend is a bad person.
"Going to jump on this and say I’m also a STEM major, but I picked up a minor in humanities because I thought it would be easy mark boosting, but also give me a chance to evolve some other skill sets. 

I was wrong about it being easy. It’s easier in a sense because I find the professors more lenient with extensions etc., but the work itself I struggled with. I have no problem reading and writing scientific articles for hours, but it came down to two final essays for a course and while my classmates were breezing through them with eloquent arguments I had to revert to a layout that a high schooler would use and try and build it up. I found it extremely frustrating, and that’s when it really clicked for me how different people have different skills, despite educational levels. 

Sounds like your boyfriend is a good dude who already the lesson I did. Maybe try and find something that’s new to both of you to do together, like a puzzle/game/escape room/museum or something? Then you’re on equal footing learning about a new topic. "
"She *literally* said ""I don't have a boyfriend"".

To be honest...I think that's all you needed to hear. He didn't make anything up, she's been lying and cheating on BOTH of you."
"No, you're not being immature. You didn't pin him while he howled in protest and tell him what a sissy loser weakling he was. If he feels emasculated by the fact that you have greater lower body strength than him, that's a *him* problem, and he should ask himself why his sense of masculinity is contingent upon being able to physically overpower his partner.

In your shoes, I'd ask him what he feels like he's gaining by behaving in ways that disrespect you. I'd also ask yourself whether you can continue to be in a relationship with someone who needs to feel like he has one up on to be secure."
Yeah the real concerning part is not that he's a drug dealer it's that OP was dating him for 5 YEARS and she didn't know. He has a problem being honest and truthful and that is something to stay as far away from as possible.
"You essentially just wrote a book about how Hunter is too mentally ill to be in a relationship right now. He is acting more like a child than a husband. While people jump to divorce a lot on this sub I think you should consider it. He is making you so so mentally ill and unhappy. He has shown that he isn't willing to put the work in and get counseling to fix things. You deserve a partner, not someone who acts like a child and expects you to be responsible for their emotional needs. Your entire post was about hunter. What he wanted and what he feels. What do you want? It seems to me like you already know you want to end things and that's okay. I'm sorry. You deserve better. "
"With a controlling family and an ex-bf who degrades you, spending some time alone and focusing on your studies/grades might be best for you.

Check with your uni, they might have student housing that you can use temporarily. "
"To post OP, I would be on edge too if i was 250k under water w my husband. 

You should be telling him exactly how u feel and consider therapy together. You both need to hear eachother I think."
"You’re 25 years old. An adult capable of making her own choices. The fact that you live not too far from each other but still haven’t seen each other in so long is just crazy to me. Why are you letting them rule your life? Just go see him? You’re super lucky that he is so patient with you and doesn’t think you’re trying to break up with him. 
Just tell them “this is what I’m doing”. And do it. "
"You're engaged before the one year mark so yes, you have moved way too fast. You also moved in after 6 months which is a great way to ruin things. On top of that, he told half truths out the gate, and when caught, he gaslights which is actually a tool of abuse. Don't marry this person, he's red flag city. "
"You wife needs some serious individual counseling to help her understand how to establish and maintain boundaries.

You might want to get her a copy of *Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No To Take Control of Your Life* by Cloud and Townsend to get to realize that she has lost herself completely in her relationship with her sister."
"&gt; My family is now trying to pressure me to add Rebecca to my bridesmaid party 

Did Rebecca talk to you? Did she contact you, because if she didn't you should respond to your family with ""If Rebecca wants something from me, she should talk *to* me and not *about* me. I have not heard from her since \[insert when\], but if she has an issue with me, I'd be willing to listen to what she has to say. I trust that Rebecca can resolve this with me."" Repeat, repeat, repeat that this is between Rebecca and you and that Rebecca can work on this with you by talking to you and not about you.

Let Rebecca talk to you. This is her problem with you. Just like you shouldn't fix other people's problems for them, your other family members should not fix Rebecca's problem for her. She's making it look like it is other people's problem by blowing up their phones, but in the end she has a problem with you and she should fix this with you. "
"To piggy back on this. Watch Sebastian Junger TED talks on why soldiers miss the army/miss combat/ and have a hard time reintegrating.  They can maybe give you a little perspective of where he's at in his headspace. Maybe him watching them would  help him understand the WHY of what he's feeling. Also maybe look around for some veterans support groups and a professional who is familiar with his backround. Otherwise all you can do is be there for him, and understand that ultimately if he does hurt himself it is not because you didnt do enough. If helping him starts to take a toll on you consider seeking counseling yourself. "
"He came up with the trade idea but it’s not an even trade. He takes E for fun. You take medication because your body needs it to function. It’s an awful thing of him to ask you. 

I totally know it’s hard to be with someone who is depressed. I have been chronically depressed for years with a nice dash of anxiety. My husband was the same as your SO - “it’s all in your head” “weak people need medication to be normal”. Then he had something happen that triggered PTSD, depression, anxiety &amp; dissociative identity disorder. He has apologized to me so many times for not understanding before that depression/anxiety are legitimate medical issues. 

As far as him needing an outlet - get a therapist. Not someone who you may have to interact with. "
"So you gave a female friend a watch worth tens of thousands of dollars for Christmas? Have you ever given your girlfriend anything of that value? 

How would you feel if she did something similar? I think it's pretty excessive and a bit strange if I'm honest. If someone gave me a watch worth that much, I'd definitely wonder why."
"You aren’t ruining this women’s life. If anyone is ruining her life it’s her husband. If you tell her you’re giving her an opportunity to decide what she wants to do. 

If it were you in her position, would you want to be told? "
Thank you!! 
"I’ve been divorced twice now. Both times I made very specific requests of my partners while we were “working on the relationship”. Just as you did. My needs were no mystery. 

And both times, my exes managed to somehow find it in themselves to give the exact behavior I requested, to their next partner, but not to me. 

It’s absolutely devastating to BEG someone for years to get off the couch and run/ workout with you, only to have them suddenly run marathons, (yes, literal marathons) with their next partner. Or to have them claim they aren’t hypocrites and won’t set foot in a church with YOU, but suddenly they are devout.... with their next partner. Or to hear they’re willingly taking on parenting duties for someone else’s children, while ignoring their own kids with you. 

I 100% understand your pain. You aren’t crazy. I don’t have any advice for you other than to accept that you can’t control him and that you’re better off without him. Because truly, based on your post, you are. ((Hug)) I’m very sorry you’re going through this. "
"Totally agree. OP was he home when this occurred?? If so, the fact that he didn’t go with you to help speaks volumes about who he is as a person. "
"I don't know where he is because he won't talk to me

nothing else has been wrong lately except for him being a little distant, but that's probably because of end of year business stress"
"&gt;So I want to be very careful about what I say.

Nope, you be direct about this stuff and you do not wait for him to ask you if you're upset. ""You made plans with us and bailing on us is completely unacceptable. You're being rude and inconsiderate of me and our guest. If you want to hang out with (friend), we are more than happy to have her included in OUR plans.""

If your boyfriend accuses you of anything like being jealous or threatened: ""This is about you choosing to be rude and inconsiderate of our guest and me. If you feel we actually have a problem with jealousy, we can discuss it another time in a more constructive manner. Right now I want to know what you're going to do about tonight.""

If he still bails on you guys, then you know where you stand. You make the best of it by hanging out with your friend and try to come up with something fun. Then you plan on how you want this relationship to go cause he sounds like a selfish ass"
"&gt;My own aunt told my cousin ""what he doesn't know won't hurt him""

"First of all I am so sorry that happened to you. Reliving the abuse you endured is really, really tough, but added onto it the one person you cherish the most saying you deserved it in some way or excusing it... I am so sorry.

I work with a lot of sick, elderly people. Sadly because of age their brains deteriorate and change in ways that are not always good. We had a patient the other day who was sweet as pie, but as soon as the sun went down did a 180. She began rummaging through our nurses station believing it was her kitchen, and threatening all of the staff saying we messed it up and now she has to clean. 

Try not to hold onto the anger. She is not herself and your father is taking advantage if her. It may be hard right now since the wounds are fresh but try to remember the good times and who she was when raising you."
"This is the answer right here. If OP's friend is thinking about dumping her BF, then she absolutely needs to know a very public surprise proposal is heading her way.

OP doesn't need to reveal any details whatsoever (other than it's going to be public - because a lot of people would be extremely embarrassed by that), so, if her friend decides that marrying this guy would be awesome, she can be mentally prepared AND still be surprised when it happens.

But, I suspect OP's friend is going to be horrified by this secret proposal plan and it's going to inspire her to finally call time on a relationship between two incompatible people that has run its course.
"
"Don't be alone with him. No item left behind is worth your health. Your father would gladly give up that necklace in exchange for your safety. Whatever you have left behind is an acceptable loss.

I'd look to a domestic violence shelter for more resources. You might not want to think of yourself as a victim of DV but you absolutely were. They can help you with things like therapy, which you might find helpful."

"You don’t even live together, you’re not married, why would you merge finances?

She had a credit card, she should open another one *and* be responsible for managing it properly, no bailouts. "
Maybe they did it on purpose... When you marry into a family you have to protect them even if it’s from your own blood... I know I would if I knew they spent 35k on crap when they have a wife and 2 kids... 
"Physically where is he?  Where did he sleep?

"The sneezing thing sounds more like a light hearted jokey type conversation to me than anything. I don't think she seriously wanted you to bless her. As others have said, sounds like she's just bored so she's mentioning whatever is going on with her at the moment, which isn't anything particularly interesting. But she feels like chatting. You don't have to respond if you don't feel like it, or you could respond with equally dumb/meaningless stuff, it's really not that deep. I'm sure her expectations aren't all that high when she sends message like ""I sneezed"". She sounds like one of those people who texts super casually, as if the person she's texting is actually sitting beside her shooting the shit, not someone who texts with purpose."
"I (23F) also have a controlling (and abusive) mother.

"Tell him you need couples therapy, now! Do some research and find someone who specializes in couples AND body dysmorphic disorders. You will both go into therapy first, then your husband will start going to therapy on his own and keep going to couple's therapy. This sounds like a serious issue. I don't mean to ring the alarm bells, but get this done first of the year. Start calling therapist today. 

When you approach him, don't make it about him. Make it about ""us.""

Tell him you are concerned about some areas of you all's marriage and don't know what to do. I'm sure there are other issues outside of the plastic surgery. Bring those up too. Tell him you don't know what to do and you feel lost. Ask him if he knows what to do. Regardless of what he says, if he doesn't say therapy, ask him what he thinks. If he says he won't do it, ask him if he would try it if there was a small chance it could make your marriage better? If that doesn't work, ask him if he would do it of it could save your marriage? 

It doesn't need to be an ultimatum unless he puts you in that position. I wouldn't do any ultimatum style stuff without reasoning with him for a couple of weeks. 

I'm sorry and good luck. "
"&gt;his dad made weird comments about my nose saying stuff like ""you must be in finances with that nose"" and jokingly said he wanted to keep an eye on the silverware with me in the house

He thinks you’re Jewish, because all Jewish people have big noses and are money-grubbing thieves. Oh wait, what I meant was your spineless, lying boyfriend’s dad is a bigoted asshole racist."
Emotional affairs are a real thing.  Have you asked him how he would feel if roles where reversed?  He makes a point to wear her gifts when hes going to see her. Are you sure your not a rebound?
"Be aware that a future move may be to suddenly become homeless, so she ""has"" to move in with you, ""temporarily"". Do not let that happen, as she will never leave. Drop her off at the nearest shelter and run."

"I assume it was both of your decision to have a baby. If not that, then it was still both of your decision to have sex. Now the pregnancy is both of your responsibility, so you have every right to be upset. He's acting like a child, not like a father.

Not sure if you've done this but I would have a very long conversation with him about how he sees the future and responsibilities regarding raising the child (and also the household in general). Does he think that he can keep on going out and you would be always there taking care of the baby and the household? If so, I'm pretty sure you won't need him beside you.

What if something happens to you/baby while he's away partying? He needs to start acting as an adult and as a partner. Plus it really does not seem that he cares enough about you... when I am feeling down and not sure if I want to go out, my bf says that it's okay, WE don't need to go. It's the ""me and you"" vs ""us"" that matters. "
Dibs on names only works if you get pregnant first. 
"His mom probably wasn't making a jab at you, just stating that she didn't want her kids far away. She is over the top in the way she said it, and she can't control where her kids live.


But where does your boyfriend want to live? You refer to yourself as nomadic, but there are a lot of people who like to stay in one place once they are settled. Sometimes that's because of family. Or friends. A job field. Just liking the city. Would you be happy staying in the current city for the rest of your life. Not because his mom wants him to, but because those are HIS plans? Whether it's because of him wanting to be with his family or not. 


If you'd be happy in the city, and feel like the amount of time you spend with his family is reasonable, good. However, if you want to move around from city to city every few years, that's something you need to discuss with him, because you might have different life plans."
He sounds controlling and abusive. I think you should go to individual therapy before couples therapy because that generally isn't recommended for people like your husband. 
I hadn't considered this. Thanks for bringing it up. 
"Everything this person said. I would go as far as to argue that sexual incompatibility is more common than it is uncommon, and I've cut off multiple relationships because of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and I say this kindly: you guys are already having sex. Oral sex is still sex. Not sure where this ""the vagina is the one true sex"" idea comes from (and it sounds like it's coming more from him than you, OP), but it's pretty silly, especially considering the many relationships in which no vaginas are in the picture. "
If you communicated your needs and he isn't meeting them there isn't anything wrong with terminating the relationship.  It happens. You'll probably be happier. 
"Happy people tend to post less than those that are stressed out and miserable- don't base your presumptions on what parenthood looks like on posts you see on Reddit.  Kids tend to grow up to be very like their parents which isn't at all surprising when you think about it.  That said, being raised by an unhappy, stressed-out parent can really mess a kid up.  Sit down and give serious thought to whether or not you can be a loving and enthusiastic parent.  This isn't something you can compromise on, so this will be the most important and possibly most upsetting conversation of your relationship.  If you can't enter into parenthood with a whole heart, you need to let your husband find the mother of his children while you find a partner who wants to be childfree.  Take your time making this decision. "

"I've helped friends do it in one swoop - when the guy is at work. Just pack, move, write a note, and leave, in a few hours. Definitely check with the experts to see if this is a smart way to do it, but I think that's what has worked best for people I know. It's also something people would definitely help with - get friends so it is quick."

"I am an atheist, and I approve this message. 

u/moniroo - consider yourself fortunate you have seen all he is before marriage. This is your chance to save yourself from not only more of this in marriage, but even more. What happens if you two decide to kids and he wants a “two week break” while you are pregnant or caring for a newborn so he can go sleep with others? Because it will happen. Over and over. Until he decides he wants to be with someone else permanently, likely, someone who does not come with what he perceives as the “burdens” or marriage and so on. I have seen this story play out many times.

You don’t need him. You need therapy. There is no way you should have put up with his actions and treatment for this long, and you did because your confidence, sense of self-esteem, understanding of what is acceptable or not, and all of that are broken. But they can be repaired. This is in your control. He, and your relationship are *not*

Stop letting him steer your life. End it. Move back with family or find roommates, get into therapy. Cancel the wedding and get what you can back in deposits. The rest is gone, but still far cheaper than it will be to stay with this guy."
"Relationships aren’t my specialty but sports are. At 28 to have any shot at being a pro you need to have an incredibly unique skill to make it to the MLB. Any position besides DH and Pitcher you need to be an incredible athlete. If he matched any of those traits he’d be in the minor leagues right now or on an MLB roster right now. So unless he is planning on becoming my a knuckleball pitcher his shot is over. 
Have him google how many 28 year old rookies have made it into the majors over the last 10 years that don’t meet the traits I listed above and hopefully reality will begin to set in.
Now with you being successful and supportive I’d suggest talking to him about volunteering at a high school team to live vicariously and stay around the game. Maybe he can pursue coaching as a career but at the very least he can be around a ball field and with players that are passionate about the game who he can help pass along his knowledge too. I’m walking out of work now but pm me if you’d like any advice with handling him logically with a sports mind."

Watching a show??? That is so insignificant. Like who cares omg. You can just watch it again if he wanted you to watch it with him that badly. 

You make yourself sound like a horrible wife who neglects her husband but you're just a human who makes a mistake here and there...and these are small. Dont call yourself an inconsiderate bitch because you're not. It sounds like your husband wants to be #1 priority 100% of the time and you cant have a life of your own.

Well thank god and mostly your good sense for that. God I want to punch him in his STUPID FUCKING FACE. Obviously, you are not overweight in the slightest - according to Google's handy-dandy body mass index calculator, your height and weight put you at a BMI of 20.1 which puts you on the low end of a normal weight according to the National Institute of Health. But even if you WERE overweight, none of it matters - he's like this because he's a shitty person. God only knows WHY your dad is like this, but suffice to say that he's an abusive piece of shit who will die alone and miserable and he'll deserve it. 

&gt;Whenever I try to stand up for myself he’ll threaten me with the “I won’t pay for your education” line.

This is my big concern. Because he's an abusive piece of shit, he might actually follow through on this threat and that really concerns me, because the best way for you to recover and protect yourself from his abuse is to just get away from him altogether. How long will it be before you leave for university? Can you last if you just try to avoid him as much as humanly possible, and vent to your friends and maybe a therapist to protect your mental health? 

Also! look up the ""grey rock technique"" online, it's a way to deal with abusive assholes while making yourself as unobtrusive as possible, to avoid conflict. Which, again, you shouldn't HAVE to do, because your dad shouldn't be an abusive piece of shit. But he is, so here we are."

It's not strange that he doesn't like his family and that you therefore don't have a relationship with them. What's strange is you don't know *why* and you aren't invited to accompany him to family-related events when he actually does see them during a major holiday.

Something tells me OP and mom aren’t going to always agree regarding the handling/parenting of the baby... Let’s hope the lies she tells then are fewer and not more extreme. "
He did everything right in response to your discomfort so I'd say no. Worry if he tries to reconnect and not a day before (as hard as that may be). Good luck and remember that comparison is the thief of joy. Their relationship failed and that's all you need to remember about her.

"I have a girlfriend who pulls this kind of BS. She’s been in a relationship with one of my best friends for over a decade, but forms these intense emotional relationships with other guys that definitely toe the line of infidelity. When her husband starts raising concerns about how close she is with her latest ‘friend,’ she then goes nuts trying to find the ‘perfect’ girl to set her friend up with. She lovebombs the new potential girlfriend so the girlfriend will be ever so grateful for being set up with such a great guy and never question my friend’s relationship with their new boyfriend. 

It’s an incredibly irritating thing to deal with, and it’s caused issues in our social group more than once. I think it comes from a place of deep insecurity and fear that she’ll be left without an emotional safety net if anything happens to her partner, but that doesn’t forgive it in the least. "

 If my partner said to me “Babe, you’re literally wearing everything I own to the point I have nothing to wear. Is it alright to tone it down a bit or use a few of your own clothes for lounging as I need those shirts for work?” I would of course do so. 

My boyfriend has come home with new clothes and has explicitly said “please don’t wear these as they’re for work”.  It isn’t an insult it’s just common sense. You need clothes and she needs to not be so dramatic with throwing something in the wash after having it on for 5 minutes.  Just tell her.

"Make her even more uncomfortable until she sees how it feels when she pulls it on you. For example:

Her: He’s in his mid twenties.

You: So? Age is just a number, you are only as old as you feel.

Her: I’m also married. 

You: Well yeah, but divorces exist. Don’t let that pesky little wedding ring keep you from the true love of your life, Kevin.

Her: ...are you crazy?

You: I’m not nearly as crazy for Kevin as you are, clearly. 

Her: Um wtf?!?

You: You seem weirded out, Laura. Huh, it’s almost like it’s inappropriate to talk about someone’s romantic life in the workplace and continue to badger her into dating someone she has expressed a repeated disinterest in. This is a revelation for me. Wow. 

Then again, I’m kind of an asshole when someone casually invades my personal boundaries and refuses to take no for an answer. Your mileage may vary. "

"TBH, the fact that you can already answer a lot of the questions about the specifics is a really good sign that you've actually thought about this and done the research and aren't just jumping into it.  I can see some potential negatives (what if you get divorced some day?  is there any way to quickly get a prenup in place in case that happens?), but I do think the positives are fairly strong."

"Do you live in the US? If it’s educational training for her job, then it is tax deductible. And if it’s something she needs to keep her certification or licensing she should really be planning on advance to budget for expenses like that. Personally I have a bank account and credit card that I use just for business income and expenses so that it is easy to track things like that. If my business can’t afford it, then I can’t afford it. And yes, it sucks to wait but if it’s really essential training then it’ll be offered multiple times in the year presumably. You could perhaps offer to help her set up her accounts and finances better so that she can afford to attend the next seminar.

Edit: Also she can ask the people giving the seminar for a payment plan. I do that sometimes even if I don’t technically need to, but it helps with budgeting. Companies in these types of job areas are used to people not having all the cash together. However they may need the full amount paid before attending, so again it may only be a plan for the next one. "
"&gt;It rings of someone who is also an abuser, frankly, and her behavior is indicative of that.

I agree. Abusers speak the language of other abusers and tend to be their own biggest advocates. OP's gf may be hearing about all of his mom's abuse and thinking ""well that's not so bad/I might've done xyz given those circumstances"" and not finding it nearly as atrocious as the rest of us.

Also, I wouldn't be surprised if OP found a girlfriend incredibly similar to his own mom, despite all her abuse. It's what he's familiar with after all."

"Somehow I’m at a loss how to reply. We don’t live together, so there’s no ‘homemaker vs big bucks’ sort of thing, so I guess I really don’t know. I love her a lot though. We’ve been through some financial ups and downs (mostly cuz of her job).   

I’m still texting her rn, and our conversation kind of blew up when I told her I felt she didn’t have any sort of financial plan on how she was going to start saving for either the former loan or this new loan. She said summer bonuses should cover it, but still hasn’t started any savings while repeating she can make the month payment for 2nd loan for the seminar... "
"You’re 29??

You need to learn about professional boundaries and look for a new job ASAP.

You want closure?  That happened when he rejected you.  There’s nothing further to discuss.

You want validation?  About what?  "
Seems like you tried to give the guy some perspective several times and he was still too dense to consider that unemployment and relationship turmoil is a stupid time to propose. I think at this point it's best to just let the chips fall where they may. It might be a blessing in disguise since it will probably force a conversation that neither one of them has initiated.
"I think letting him make choices is amazing advice, but I would add that you should maybe have a few pre-planned choices for him so he does not get overwhelmed with the possibilities. Sometimes children in this situation freeze or even say they ""dont care"" when they have too many choices because they aren't used to making them. You are going to do amazing!"
"He is just a kid who needs love and attention. Draw pics with him of things he likes to get to know him or go for a walk in a quiet nature setting and try talking/look for cool rocks, sticks and things. Your an awesome person for spending your time making the world a better place. Keep it up!"
"I used to do something similar when I lived in a different city a few years ago, bringing home developmentally disabled people for the holidays. As they had no family or had been abandoned, the thing they looked forward to most rather than the food or gifts were the experiences I gave them that they couldn't get living at the facility.
Baking cookies, making crafts, watching a movie with a hot chocolate from the safety of a pillow fort, or going around and checking out people's Christmas lights made them so happy. That's where the magic is. "
"&gt;I called the therapist today to make an appointment for couples therapy. 

Couples therapy is not appropriate for this situation.   You are married to an abusive man.   He needs to be in a specialized program for abusers and you should be in individual counseling to help you see why your strategies will keep failing.   

You can use the time you are waiting to get into individual counseling to read two book:

* *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft
* *Boundaries in Marriage* by Henry Cloud and John Townsend

The Bancroft book will give you a much clearer picture of your marriage.   The book by Cloud and Townsend should help you see why you cannot be responsible for making things better with your husband.   Your walking on eggshells just allows him to avoid the consequences of bad behavior.  You are not being supportive, you are enabling his anger and abuse."
"Hes abusive girl and you need to set some boundaries. You are an adult, you are a mother. You dont have to ask permission or let him dictate how long you will be out of the house. Its courtesy to let a partner know, but in no way, shape or form are you asking permission. Teach him this.

The dating apps thing? Yeah I'd leave. Hes hiding things from you, then getting mad when caught out.  He hasnt shown you an ounce of respect and you deserve more."
"So if your relationship is good otherwise, I think you can make a lot of progress here by asking him very specific questions.  Ask him, “Hey, why did you get me perfume?” “What made you choose these dresses?”  “Why did you pick this band?”  You can even start these questions with “Thank you for the gift.”  I think maybe having to answer out loud and explain his reasoning might be a starting point to get this conversation going.  Because if he says “I thought you would like it,” you can explain to him what you explained to us.  “But I’ve explained I don’t like this style/perfume/band,” and maybe get him to face his own reasoning.  This is a big issue but if your relationship is good otherwise, I wouldn’t say immediately dump him.  People have ideals in their head and he might have some cognitive dissonance over how it’s manifesting in real life and affecting a real person.  "

"Sweetheart, Reddit doesn’t need to ridicule you. You’ve done nothing worth ridiculing, and it sounds like your husband does enough of that to you himself. But honestly. Why are you with this controlling, sexist, abusive douchebag??? I can’t even imagine my boyfriend talking to me the way yours does to you. He is nothing but sweetness and patience, there is no criticism, no insults, no demeaning me or telling me what to do “better”... No telling me to deactivate my social media or controlling what I do, or telling me whether I can or can’t work—and then having his mom blame YOU for it when he convinces you to quit!!! What is that?? I don’t even know your husband but my immediate gut instinct is that he needs to a hard boot to the ass. How he treats you is inexcusable and unfortunately it sounds like you have come to believe that it’s normal. It isn’t. Most men don’t treat their partners the way yours treats you. You are still young and you can find someone better.

Also... you say you’ve been with him for 6 years? And so that would mean you’ve been together since you were 17 and he was 23? Huuuuuge red flag right there. This is exactly the kind of loser, douchebag behavior I would expect from a guy that would date a minor at age 23."

It's not a lost cause. You create your real self, through your actions, as well as your thoughts and beliefs. I would start by reading novels. There is a lot of research out there about how reading fiction is a very serious way to develop empathy. You get to be inside the mind of these characters, and you learn how to consider the perspectives of others. You get outside of yourself. 

&gt;I recently started therapy but I can't even feel honest with my therapist. What hope is there?

There's a *lot* of hope. You want to change, and you're making concrete steps to do it. It's *really* hard to be honest with a therapist when you're a self-conscious, anxious person - many of us have been there. tell your therapist that. "

That doesn’t mean you have to adhere to them. You can find your own truth and forge your own path, and allow them to stick their heads in the sand. Find out the truth, but don’t force it on them if they don’t want it. Find your story, for you, and let them keep their skeletons buried.

"Are you in therapy? You need a way to sort through these feelings. Maybe if she admits there is something (well, a lot of something) wrong with her son it will feel like SHE failed. She might not want to admit it to herself because she sees her son as a reflection of her own character."
"I’m a STEM person as well and my husband is all about the arts and music, and honestly it calms me so much to have someone like him. Since I was a kid I’ve always been a “ go go go” kind of a person and I over analyze everything, and my husband is the exact opposite so it’s nice to have that counterpart. I see life so differently with him. Also, we teach each other things on different subjects all the time. If that isn’t one of the greatest parts of a relationship then we are doing this marriage thing all wrong .

"I can’t imagine how exhausted you must feel, just reading that post. I’m so sorry you’re in this situation. It sounds like you and Hunter are both good people, but he’s drowning in anxiety and taking you down with him. This can’t go on.

There is a book called “Codependent no More,” which I suggest you should read. Basically, you are not responsible for his feelings and anxiety. As long as you hold his hand, he will never learn how to cope properly. So stop holding his hand. 

1.) The morning routine needs to end. Wake up, take care of animals (they actually need you), and get to work. If your husband gets anxiety and skips on work, not your problem. He needs to figure this out himself. 

2.) Turn your phone off during work time. He needs to learn to cope without being connected to you at all times, and you need to focus and advance your position (especially in case he loses his job). 

3.) Automate your bills. Have them all set to be auto-paid by one credit card. Check the statement each month to make sure everything is good and pay it off. Autopay is your friend and will keep you from getting a headache or being late on bills. 

4.) Do not have kids (!!) or anymore pets with this man until he gets himself together. Last thing you need is more responsibility on your plate. 

5.) If you can afford it, get a cleaning service. Your time is precious, so anything you can do to save it is worth it. Automate as many mundane things in your life as you can, so you have room to breathe. 

6.) Get your own therapist. You’re on the verge of a mental breakdown because you live in a toxic environment and have to walk on eggshells all the time lest your husband starts crying like a baby because he doesn’t wanna adult. You need an outlet to release all that resentment and figure out how to restore your mental health. This may include leaving the relationship, in which case your therapist can suggesting coping techniques for that. 

7.) Still got that trip booked to Hawaii? Good. Go on the trip. Alone. Turn off your phone and enjoy the beach. Get someone to take care of the animals while you’re gone and pay the bills beforehand. Your husband will find a way to cope; he’ll have no other choice. As for you, you need a damn vacation. You’ve been someone’s care taker for too long. The time alone will give you a chance to reflect on your life and decide what you truly want out of it, and whether this plan includes Hunter or not. "
"Plenty of women like sports.  I'm a woman and I couldn't date a guy who didn't at least tolerate sports--because then I wouldn't be able to talk to him about sports, watch with him, go to games with him, and he'd be annoyed with me disappearing to a sports bar every sunday.  It's just a compatibility thing, not a sexism thing.  Finding a woman who likes sports won't be his issue--finding a woman who is okay with not getting head ever is going to be the harder one (but I do have friends who don't like receiving it, so it's still not impossible)."
Does your boyfriend call him out on his shit?
"\&gt; *Apparently the stress between them when they were younger was partly because his brother ""stole"" 3 different girlfriends from my boyfriend, so my boyfriend just thinks his brother has been successful again.*

Or so his brother claims.  For all we know, you could be the fourth woman who's been a victim of the brother's lies and your boyfriend's trust issues.

Honestly, if he's willing to take the word of his brother (who he doesn't get along with) over his girlfriend of three years...that says a lot about him and/or what he thinks about you.  Hopefully he'll either get some therapy to work on his insecurities or admit what the real issue here is."
Hahaha Thank you for the laugh
