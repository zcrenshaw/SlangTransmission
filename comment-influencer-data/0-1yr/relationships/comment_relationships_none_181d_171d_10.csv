I think it’s both. I’m not really sure how to feel tbh. I’m kind of caught off guard. If he’s into penis that’s just not something I was expecting 
"Had an ex that wanted one with her friend (bi girls) and the sex was already going good just we weren’t doing as much adventurous things like going on adventures anymore. I honestly didn’t notice it but she kept bugging about it and I think she noticed things weren’t increasing as we’d just hang out instead of so many dates and parties all the time. After I said no to the threesome she got angry claiming it’s every guys dream and I have always must’ve wanted one. Relationship ended two weeks after that. No real explanation besides  “I don’t feel those butterflies anymore. Haven’t in a month,” after a year of dating. I personally don’t think threesomes are good unless you’ve both had a strong sexual past and if your mans okay with you taking some better dick (which is hella rare unless he’s into cucking)
"
"&gt; I’ve mentioned it but he brushes it off. He always seems to out logic me and then make me feel bad for even asking.

So he doesn't want to spend time with you, video games are such a huge priority that he has to get up at odd hours to play, he would rather argue ""logic"" than listen to your concerns, he dismisses your feelings and makes you feel bad for asking...

I think you should break up with him, focus on your life/interests/goals, and find a boyfriend who wants to spend some time with you, has a somewhat compatible schedule/lifestyle, and respects you and your feelings/concerns."
"It doesn’t sound like she knows what she wants.

Sounds like you are crushing pretty hard but this girl sounds like drama down the line even if she wants to be with you. 

Do what you want but don’t expect magical changes in her behavior: you can expect her to be erratic, hard to read and to play the field. That’s my read based on what you told me."
At least I'm willing to face what's wrong with me and try to fix it. You just make rude comments and ignore your stinky personality.

"He doesn't lie about every little thing like I imagine a compulsive liar would. It's generally things that could get him ""in trouble"" or are difficult to talk about. But I don't freak out on him when we calmly talk about things and he tells the truth. But I do get upset when I find out he lied. "
Ha! Love it.
"We ski, explore the city, hot spring, hike etc. We had some trust issues early on in our relationship that are probably rearing their heads right now."
"You gotta get out, dude. This marriage is a pile of ashes at this point. Can you honestly envision a future with complete trust of one another? "
"I mean, that's a sign that she's not the most stable person imo. She doesn't have money, doesn't seem committed to a relationship with you, and still spends money that she doesn't have to come visit you? All the signs here point to her not being ready for relationships in general."
How could staying with this creep be a good thing. Good grief. Walk away and don't look back. You need to learn to love yourself. You don't deserve to be treated like garbage.
"Yes it really is. 90% of women tear and though tears heal, it will never be quite the same. You are misinformed."
"Yes, it is wrong. You're just going so you can piss him off. That is mean, petty and won't help you or the relationship.

However, based on **why** you are doing this, I want to point out that your BF was wrong as well. You asked him something, he said he would do it and then he lied about it. You should have a conversation with him about **why** he lied and if it is important to have his ex in his life. 


Work from there."
"Long distance doesn't work for every couple; some people need to have their partner as a physical prescence in their life in order to maintain the relationship and grow. Nothing wrong with it, just different strokes for different folks.

Just because people love each other doesn't mean they are meant to be in a (healthy or otherwise) relationship. You can still love and respect someone and realize that it just won't work for your life. You can analyze to death, but don't. Some self reflection is good but don't psych yourself out!"
"I would say to keep being the awesome human that you are. Just stay true to yourself, say in a nice way how you feel, express compassion, but do not grant more legitimacy to your girlfriend's feelings about the situation than yours. It might not save your relationship, but at least you would demonstrate self-confidence and express integrity. Loving someone else at the expense of your own self is never worth it. 

If you can tolerate things that are happening, that seems like wrong behaviors to you, without feeling negatively affected by them, then keep doing the best that you can for your relationship and her. 

The way I see things, you guys are pretty mature, respectful of each others and are not afraid of expressing your feelings. Just keep doing that and time will tell. "
"He's trying to erode your ""no"" into a ""yes"". "
"Surprise expenses can be upsetting.  If I know ahead of time what I’ll be expected to pay for, I can decide to decline to go if I can’t afford it.  You two need to discuss why more about why it is that you usually pay, and whether that needs to change.  However, the time to discuss that is definitely not right after her having paid and unexpected expense.  I, personally, would prefer to take turns paying and if I’m short on money I’ll suggest doing free/cheap activities, cook at home, etc.  And if someone suggests to do something I can’t afford, I would say upfront that I can’t afford to, so then if they graciously want to agree to pay for me ahead of time then I’d go.  In that situation, if someone suddenly pulled the “forgot my wallet, you have to pay” routine, I would be upset.  If I’d known ahead of time that I would end up obligated to pay, I would have said, “no thanks, let’s stay in and watch tv.”  "
I love her in that I care for her.... but I really want to move on and be single again. 
"Dude IT IS NOT OK

"I agree with the first commenter - if you have the space, get separate beds/bedrooms. If I ever have a relationship, I don't like sharing beds and I like having my own space (blame it on being an only child) so that is ideal :)"
I get where you are coming from but it's not a good way to deal with it. 
"That does make a lot of sense. I have read on reddit previously that an open relationship should never be a solution to a problem, but more a boost to a relationship. Thanks for your response"
"&gt;He will tell you that you were leading him on, that you're a whore, that all women are awful and selfish who are out to crush his pure innocent heart.

Oooof this sentence. Whenever we talked about relationships, he'd always complain that women weren't interested in him and it was always framed as ""unfair"" to him. It's something that bugs me, but this sentence puts it nicely for me. I didn't think of it as this, and so I normally told he was shitty at getting girls prolly because he's shitty to them. But this articulates it much more nicely."
"Try joining some groups or sports leagues or volunteering or other sort of stuff that puts you into contact with people on an ongoing basis. You are in a common phase that usually happens to people a couple years from now when they finish college, but instead you are just getting it a little early. Be proactive, and if you are worried about dating, then use apps or meet friends of friends. Meeting somebody at a coffee shop or whatever is usually for the movies. When people are at a coffee shop (or wherever) they are usually in the middle of something and you trying to flirt with them is interrupting them as a stranger who may or may not have good intentions or character. As a result, they will usually brush you off without even thinking about it, because that is easier and safer than engaging."
"Yeah, no. I wouldn't want to stay with someone like that either. She sounds deeply, deeply unhappy and has the idea that something else, anything else besides her, will give her happiness. And they won't. She seems very stuck on appearances and as you said she's selfish.

If you marry her she'll likely drain you dry trying to keep up with the Kardashians and that's a really miserable existence to be trapped in.

I'd say it's time to go. I mean, there's just nothing here to salvage. I don't even see how therapy would make her stop being a materialistic selfish individual who bullies you all the time. I think living with her has brought what was always into stark reality and now you find yourself increasingly unable to ignore it.

My advice: stop ignoring it and end things. "
"The reason she's been there the longest, is because she has made it her business to get rid of anyone she can't bully.  When you talk to him, ask him how many office workers have been ""let go"" over the past few years due to her inability to work with them.  "
"I wouldn't think this would be a problem, except she's cheated on you with her ex before. That makes it a problem."
"open communication is the most important thing in any relationship. this is especially true when it comes to intimacy and sex. you both need to know what the other needs/wants at all times. now I know that dropping all that on your bf all at once AND asking him to change up his sex moves may seem suspicious to him so how about this. maybe just suggest to him that you would like to try him being more dominant during sex maybe by holding your hands down while on top of you, same reason and leaning over the back of the couch (you can easily use toys in this stance, or even on the stairs. small changes like these can make it easier to transition into more open communication until you guys are more vocal assuring both parties needs are met."
"nope, none at all. i’m in a big city actually and looked online for sober meet ups but couldn’t find any. "
"I have to advocate against threesomes with friends. I'm telling you, for most people it can contaminate otherwise healthy and happy relationships. You may be someone with an steel-strength psyche, but give it some real thought first if you care about these people. I know that's not what the question was, just need to put in my two cents. "
Lol are you that person who obsessed over Jenjenjen?
"I think you need to have a serious discussion with her about the issue and tell her you aren’t going to continue to pay for everything. It isn’t fair! 

I am a female and whenever I go on dates I’m happy to pay my half and if I am dating someone fully I am happy to do the same or sometimes pay for them as a treat. 

There is females out there who wouldn’t get mad about it! "
I asked him about it right now. He denied it then said “just stop please I don’t want added stress”. I stopped. I just wonder if he’d rather be with a trans woman. I think a conversation is owed since he follows women in our area but he shut me down. 
"Are you serious out of all the people to hang out with
She chooses an ex  there's so many red flags bro before you know she's cheating on you go with your gut you know deep down it wasn't right i say get rid of her she has no respect for you"
"We dont know each other but I am so, so proud of you. You are beyond brave and strong. I left an abusive relationship two years ago and fled the state. I have a couple tips that may help you. (Sorry for formatting I'm on mobile)

Buy a throwaway phone. 

Have an out of state friend (who isn't in the state you're heading to) make you a new email and Facebook. Turn off locations. This will throw him off any trail. Do not use this email and Facebook until you are out of the home. 

Make sure you have your Id, birth certificate and social security card. If he has your social number make sure you apply for a new one before using it anywhere. (This was my fuckup)

Before you leave, write yourself a letter reminding you why you are worth more then him. Why you deserve more then him. And anytime you doubt yourself you read that letter. 

Be safe. You are cared about. "
"It depends on your definition of cheating, and nonetheless you feel uncomfortable with it so bring it up with him"
"Thank you for your reply. 

To answer your first point, I still want to know. I don't want ""off limits"" conversations because I want her to be able to talk to me. 

For your second point, I feel like I should know. It's almost like a controlling aspect. If I know what and when she talks, I'll know if she's cheating...... I understand what I'm saying is wrong.

I guess when I'm in the moment, my gut reaction is to do that stuff. After I sit and thank for a minute, I realize it's wrong and cease that behavior. I don't know man, this shit is hard for me. 

I suppose this post is more about looking for advice on how to fix these behaviors of mine. What you've laid out is well said, and I appreciate it. "
"So talk to her, find a compromise where you have a set date where you will stop giving her money (no more than a few months) and if she can't figure out her shit enough to become independent as an adult in their 30s with your support after a few months, that really isn't your problem. I would also not be giving her money directly. Instead, you can just pay her bills if you really want to help. But no money should ever enter her hands where you can't control it IMO."
"Thank you, I'm going to message them and see what happens.  I know I'll be fine even if they do say rude things to me.  "
"Thank you, I appreciate the re-assurance. I am trying very hard to eat, but more than nausea I can't swallow even if it's liquid and I feel thirsty all the time. Actually maybe I am dehydrated because of crying. Not trying to throw a pity party.

I had given up on food for the day since I'd been trying for 16 hours already to get those two soylents down but I will try again. Thank you for the encouragement, especially the reassurance that my son will be fine.

Play RuneScape with him and get married ingame!
"&gt; “you’re the most amazing boyfriend in the world, what did I do to deserve you, I can’t wait to marry you”

Every time?? How exhausting.

&gt; “why can’t you just do what I tell you do, if you did, I’d be happy”

Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. If I typed enough Ws on that to express how disgusting it is, I'd have to pass along the task to my great-great-grandchildren.

This guy is controlling and gross. And he's a liar. Dump him and let him buy a talking body pillow, because that's what he really wants.

"
"He is being very disrespectful and rude. There’s several different issues in here, but bottom line you need to end things with him. He doesn’t appreciate your communication, he wants you to be someone that you’re not, he doesn’t listen to your feelings or try to accommodate, and hes just a mean person. You need to end things for your own mental health and happiness."
"I agree with you, you can’t be pretend to be something you are not. You should be able to be true to yourself in a relationship ( within reason) "
"How many times has he tried?

What type of dirty talk are we talking about here? Is it more on the degrading end of the spectrum, or is it more just hearing what he wants to do to you sexually in a more assertive and explicit and naughty way?

If it's the former, the degrading stuff that really is objectively disrespectful, he may just not be able to do it, at least in a convincing and ""into it"" way. Maybe with more practice and communication and seeing you enjoy it, he'll get more comfortable with it. Or maybe approaching it as more of a roll-play thing, where he does it in another character and not as himself?

If it's more the latter, then I would talk with him more about what you'd like to hear and talk to him about why it's not really disrespectful for him to want you and enjoy you in a sexual way. Maybe getting him to open up a bit about the sexual things (positions and such) that push his buttons would help, and telling him that you want (and get off) to him finding pleasure, and is the furthest thing from being disrespectful.

The last thing is to talk about it philosophically. He respects you and doesn't want to do anything that disrespects you. That's great, it sounds like you've found a keeper. One of the ultimate forms of respect is learning what really pushes your SO's sexual buttons and pushing them exactly to their liking. Obviously, there's a contradiction here of something being disrespectful in one context and not in another, and maybe what you're asking goes against some fundamental learned behaviors of his, and he is in no way obligated to do things that make him very uncomfortable, and it sort of goes without saying that he needs to find these things not a complete turn off.  But, in this case, where there's not just clear consent, but a desire for it, and it causes no harm, and in fact increases pleasure, it's simply can't be disrespectful. Like, for instance, he probably touches your breasts while having sex with you (in a loving and respectful way, no doubt), but if he touches a some random woman's breasts, that would be highly disrespectful, and maybe more apropos, if he touched your breasts in other contexts, like while you're putting on eyeliner or when you're cutting onions, or after you told him to stop touching your breasts randomly around the house and he continued to do that, that would also be totally disrespectful and maybe dangerous. So, why is it not disrespectful and even great for the both of you in one context, but totally disrespectful in another context? And why is dirty talk and taking over sexually any different than that? Hopefully something like this would help in the discussion of respect/disrespect, and also alleviate your guilt for wanting what you want."
But she said someone else is? Just because they’re friends doesn’t make it less a fact that someone’s boyfriend is going..why not use this as an opportunity to get to know this guy and be friends..

"The therapy is a great idea, but hold off on the lingerie shopping, especially in person. There are some great size inclusive lingerie lines out there online, though that she may be interested in looking at, but I'd leave it to her for now.

"At the strong request of a friend, I blocked her on Instagram. We're still Facebook friends and Snapchat friends, she even texted me about 2 months ago. (I don't want to get into too much detail, but it was her thanking me for sticking with her when she was going through a really rough time while we were together.)

Which now that I mention it, may be the reason I'm having this resurgence. I think she wanted to initiate a conversation but at the time I wasn't interested at all."
Just start bringing women home and banging them in a spare room. Eventually she’ll see it’s over 
"For me the hurdle to working with a lawyer is ginormous, but I agree with your advice. "
"Yes, but not over a piercing.   Because you both had a conversation and both came to different conclusions. You have every right to hate a piercing and to let her know that.  Just like she has every right to get the piecing, even if you don't approve.  But the lack of communication is not good for a relationship.  And this (the piercing) doesn't seem like something you are willing to accept as okay moving forward.  You don't want to get a year down the road and still have this looming between you."
"OP - get the mixer!!!

A few months before my ex and I broke up, his mom gifted us the most beautiful red Kitchenaid mixer. It was REALLY nice. I felt a little bad asking for it when she asked for gift ideas because, like you, I'd also dreamed of getting one as a wedding gift one day. But I loved baking and my ex was interested in making pasta, so she got us the whole set with pasta attachments and everything.

Lo and behold we have a CATASTROPHIC breakup like 3 months later. It kind of came out of the blue for me but his mom was completely sweet and insisted that I keep the mixer (he didn't want it). I joke that it was the best thing that came out of that relationship.

After I moved into my own place and got over him, I used the mixer for a lot of therapeutic baking. I did a lot of online dating and finally met a guy I really hit it off with. We went out for drinks for our first date, but for our second date I invited him back to my place and told him I'd make homemade pasta with my mixer.

He loved the pasta, and now we're married.

Getting a mixer now or later won't change whether or not you get married someday. But it WILL help you make a lot of delicious food. I realize the whole relationships/getting married thing can be a sensitive topic, but try to live in your own power and confidence. Ultimately all that matters is YOUR happiness. Be your best self regardless of who else is in your life!"

Why? What will change ""down the road"" except for blind optimism?"

Nope. 

Point blank, no.  

The only way I can think of is, if you're ever just chilling, watching TV and on your laptop, you could go, ""Oh remember you mentioned wanting to learn about makeup that time?  There's a TON of videos on youtube."""
"If he's constantly lying  then why are you even considering having a child with him right now? Reject the name for sure, but also don't have tie yourself any further to someone you can't trust. "

Or he could have a crush, and OP is still very perceptive.

"No, she said it was a mixture of men and women going, but the two other people with SOs were not bringing them."
"You should have hit the brakes the moment you realized there was mutual attraction, and limited your interaction with your coworker to work only, and pumped whatever energy you found in that into your relationship with your wife. You didn't and allowed yourself to get into an emotional affair with your coworker, which means you have already cheated on your wife emotionally. Did you ever stop to ask yourself: ""How would I feel if my wife were having this conversation with another man?""

Yes, maybe you're polyamourous, and maybe you can only be happy if you're in a situation where you can love multiple people. But affairs happen to monogamous people all the time. If you think about it (and leave the poly/mono-gamous thing out of it), we're sort of wired to find mates and with close proximity (coworker) to someone who pushes our ""hey, there's a good mate"" buttons, it's almost bound to happen unless you make a conscious effort to keep it from happening, especially at work and other parts of your social life. Like, if you were actively looking for it, like if you were going to bars and on dating apps and dating a bunch of other women, while you're still happy with your wife, chances are you'd probably find some people who would push your buttons. The key is to realize when it happening and take steps to keep it from being a full blown emotional affair like you are in right now. Simple things like not texting her (or responding) unless it's critical for work is an easy and great first step. Another thing is saying ""I'm sorry, but I don't want to talk about anything but work with you from now on."" to this coworker."
"Im currently in a long distance relationship of almost 2 years with 6 years together. Ideally if you wish to continue the intimacy, date nights are a must. Take some time to play games with each other, face call as much as possible. If you two are looking for sexual intimacy, try mutual masterbation over face time/video calling. Fundamentally the relationship is reliant on constant communication and interactions id be lying if at times a said i wasnt tempted to see if the grass is greener. However every time we talk i remind myself that there is a reason im with her. "
"Out with the old, in with the new. Sounds like he is stringing you along so he always has a backup for whatever reason. I would go with the new guy, even if things don't work out with him at least you started moving on. I wouldn't let your past be your future in this situation!"
"If you would like insight into how childhood trauma can affect a person forever,  the book The Body Keeps The Score is a great read.

Like other people have said, your MIL experienced different people than you husband did. And it's also very common in families with abuse to label one person the problem person and that person gets a the major share of it. When they then develop some really bad coping mechanisms, they act in ways that can further justify how their family treats them.

It sounds like there's a big legacy of pain through generations in your husbands family, and while I suggest you stay out of this whole current thing, your husband  may want to seek out therapy or at least read about chidlhood trauma so that he can be aware of how it may affect him, especially when/if you have children. Issues have  way of popping up when parenting. "

That's not his ex. You're the chick on the side most likely. 
"Honestly,  you’ll get over it.  I remember when my world completely came crashing down when my first love and I broke up.  I knew that I’d never feel this way about someone else and my life was going to shit. 

15 some odd years later, I’ve married the one I truly fell in love with and couldn’t picture a different path. "
"Another option is estate sales. My MIL took me to one and there was a white bowl-lift for around/just shy of $200. I have an avocado green tilt-head (smaller version 4.5qt I think) and I paid $330 for it for comparison. I think the bowl-lifts are 6qt and run between $400-$600?

I would’ve bought it in an instant if I wasn’t moving out of the country less than 2 weeks later (movers packed our stuff ages ago)"

I don't like this. The teacher-student or mentor-mentee relationship is really prone to boundary violations.  I'd have a conversation about this.
Thank you for this.  I’ve been so accustomed to forgiving him over the years that it’s become easy to lose sight of the reality of the situation.  I’ve already packed my things..hopefully I can power through this.
"Okay, one more thing because this dude is ticking me off. He's mad because he *made the informed decision* to give her legal ownership over the house and then she had legal claim over half the house equity? Laws are pretty predictable that way, my dude. "
"You've been together 4.5 years, this is serious and I presume he's the one and you want to marry etc?  Then he needs to come to SF.  At this point in the life course of your relationship you need to be together if you are planning to stay together long term.   It's not a matter of sacrificing his career, only balancing it.  "
"&gt; She retorted with an analogy of there was a new restaurant in town and she tried it and it made her sick so shes back to her old fav restaurant.

What a ludicrous analogy. A restaurant serves MANY people. A marriage serves ONE. If she leaves the old restaurant for a new one, the old one has the total and unequivocal right to *refuse service.* Get a divorce already. "
That’s what I don’t want
No. It's selfish and egocentric.
"And pretending the changes don’t happen are why many women are woefully unprepared and shocked by some of the physical changes. As are many men who didn’t realise just how much a woman has to go though during pregnancy.

Let me know where I referred to women as “damaged goods” though - can’t seem to find that sentence anywhere."
"Truth be told I'm totally fine with that.  I already lived my life without him, I can live the rest of my life the same.  "
"I have a big student loan to pay off, plus the $7,000 visa for me to stay. It's just been an expensive few years, and I need to start making a dent in that debt.

I'll try out centrelink!"
"Hello, we've decided to do that.  We don't go on Facebook enough that anyone would think either of us have seen it.  

I don't know if it's fair to say those things of me.  I do not expect Mary to ever forgive them and I seriously wonder how their other daughter did.  I don't judge her for being hurt by him staying with them either - however I definitely haven't appreciated what she has put my husband through for deciding what was best for him at the age of 13.

The cycle of abuse is really prevalent in their family and I think that she has done the best she could with the cards she was dealt.  Danny fondly remembers her as the best mom when he was younger but he also remembers the emotional abuse that his step father put him through while she enabled.  

And you're right about me having negative feelings toward what she put her kids through.  We took in Zane three years ago and have helped him build a more independent life and sometimes it's hard not to judge the stories I hear from him.  

But I do empathize with her and know that she loves her sons more than anything else in life and that she did her best.  I left so much out of this that it's impossible to paint the true story.  However, I was really looking for guidance on what to do next.  Not validation that my MIL sucks.  

"
"I think you're over thinking it. You told her, she explicitly told you it was ok, and implicitly told you not to talk to her about it anymore. "
"Yeah, the body changes through pregnancy. Treating women who've given birth like damaged goods is fucked up though."
[removed]
"Look, I'm not going to deny that childbirth changes a woman's body in incredibly dramatic ways and that it is a life risking process. If you don't want to have a kid that is your choice. God knows I'm terrified of childbirth personally but I think saying that someone's body changes is more accurate than 'destroyed.' "
"She did the right thing? She showed nothing, but when first married she wasn’t like this? So why the change?"
"If you can't contact him directly, contact him though the oldest child.  This kind of secret always comes out one way or another.  Don't be creepy about it just include a picture of yourself and say you are trying to contact [name] "
[removed]
I'm hoping if it's as off as you and I think that she comes to these conclusions on her own soon. I can't force her to see it my way or anyone else's way.
"Honestly that’s a bit irrational and rude of her. I prefer mixed girls but I still love my Asian girlfriend the way she is, and I wouldn’t want her any other way. My love for her overrides my preference, because at that point I don’t care about race. Then again, I guess people have different perspectives on the subject."
"""I'll give her some flowers and hopefully she'll shut up about it for a while."""
You can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves and I would advise against getting in the middle of the marital issues between your mom and your step dad. 
"You need to go where the ducks are. That means online dating, meet up groups, and social events hosted by your uni.

Walking up to people--especially women--in public and asking them questions is going to make most women pretty uncomfortable, just fyi. Your best bet is to put yourself in situations where people have, just by showing up, *already signaled that they're into meeting new people* rather than, e.g., forcibly engaging in conversation women who are just trying to study or get where they're going."
Fixed it 🙂
Do you like penis? Probably only lesbians are indifferent to them? Penis is awesome!
"You are describing my SO! 

OP, it may not seem like THAT big of a deal, but you have the added pain / frustration of him lying to you before. And of course it stings because it was something you thought you had overcome but trust is about consistency and this seems to be about him falling for old patterns. I think you should talk to him about it, and you should both talk about trust and his lying. He needs to make you feel safe and not suspicious or paranoid about the things you share, even more when it comes to a future child. "
"Just tell him. If you're not as satisfied as you could be, you need to give him the chance to be all that you want him to be. "
It's not even the first time and the first topic he has been lying me about.
"Look, see the reply by Invincrono above.  This is no big deal, it's just step one. If you bail you lose your best opportunity.  Go along, be cool, act happy no matter what. If you impress, you probably will get a one-on-one date next time."
"Aside from the name, she is speaking in the future tense? Why is she asking him what their future hypothetical kids will be named? He is married, is he not? Why is he allowing that and still speaking to her? 

I mean, the name is obviously out, but I feel like there is a bigger problem here?"
[removed]
If she wants a piercing that's her choice. If you seriously want to break up with her because you think it's soooo repulsive she deserves way better than you lol.
"Yeah! This is something I think about often. 

OP, if the legal aspect of marriage isn't important to you, see about making this compromise. You get to wear your dress, say vows if you'd like - essentially have a wedding without the legally binding aspect of marriage. 

My grandparents did this, however it was an accident as they just forgot to send in the paperwork. 

Also consider highlighting the financial pros of being legally married and see if that sparks an interest."
Prime candidate for a fuck-atronic robot. They make those now. For people EXACTLY like this 
"My Fiance's ex-girlfriend is EXACTLY like your girlfriend. And they didn't work out, long-term.

No, her behaviour is NOT normal. There is nothing wrong with a woman paying for her own things, and this is coming from a Woman! 

  
It's lovely that you have bought things for her in the past, but it should be done as a treat, especially if you offer. She shouldn't expect you to pay every damn time, it's so unfair to you.   
Her anger is completely unwarranted.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Also very true. It'd be great to just be honest with her, hopefully I can get the chance to have that chat with her. I'd really love to do it in person rather than online messaging, but yeah... at this point, it's probably time to just confront the problem or walk away."
"I'm a bit suspicious of your fundamental issue, but of course you can. If one bit of metal is enough to completely turn you off a person, break up and move on."
"Why is everyone so focused on the name? The real issue is that your husband compulsively lies to you. You can't trust him, even when he says he's stopped he hasn't. It doesn't matter what he promises you, he'll instantly go back on his word if it means he gets what he wants."
u in the wrooooong thread brother 
"She wants to be taken care of, this relationship is not going to work out if you don’t want to take care of her. You should have to if you don’t want to. "
"I’d stay out of this one. 

The Mandy and Bob you and your husband know are not the Mandy and Bob that Mary experienced growing up. When people say that the effects of abuse ripple outwards in a family, this is exactly what they mean - even the people who weren’t directly abused are harmed by the aftershocks. Mary doesn’t owe them forgiveness or a relationship just because it would make you and your husband more comfortable. 

Since you seem to grasp that, you’re ready for the next bit - you can love Mandy and Bob, while also acknowledging that they *deeply* wronged their children, and that some wounds will never fully heal. It’s great that they decided to turn it around and be model grandparents, but to someone like Mary, the fact that they could get it together for their grandkids but not for her or her siblings only twists the knife. It’s almost impossible not to take that personally. Mary’s childhood likely *caused*, or at minimum exacerbated, her mental illness. She will live with that damage for the rest of her life.

If you can wrap not just your head, but your *heart* around that fact, you’ll be a lot less dismissive of Mary in the future. If that means you’re also a little warier towards Bob and Mandy, so be it. You don’t need to hate them, or shun them, but you do need to understand emotionally that they are more complicated people than the ones you describe in your post. The sweet innocent grandparents you know are capable of great cruelty, and you’ll never know for sure that those days are entirely behind them. "
"We talked, he said he still likes her, so yeah most probably they were fucking behind my back all this time."
"Personally, I don't advocate having children with people who are untrustworthy, at all. This guy lies to your face, what makes you think he won't damage any children he has with his constant lying? This dude needs years of individual therapy before he's ready for fatherhood, let alone a marriage."
"I really didn’t think of it that way. It was atrocious, especially right after we had such a fun time on by bday.

What’s funny is that he tried to play this stupid emotional card, telling me he believed in me and who I was, and I didn’t have to be starting fights over things that weren’t true (!!) etc.

And I was like, yep! I don’t need someone with a personality like hot garbage. Byebitch. It was a good feeling. Thanks for your support :)"
"He’s said he would do a will and I’ve mentioned the medical power of attorney before and he doesn’t seem to think it’s a big deal. 
We do plan on buying a vehicle together at the end of the year. I don’t know how that shared asset would be protected. 

I’m not sure what he’s afraid of.  I think his divorce just shook him. And he was very upset about having to give his ex half the house equity because he bought it before they were married, but eventually put her name on it. 

"

"Yep. 

Personally, I would tell her. Yes, it would probably crush her, but finding out later on that everyone knew except her will crush her even more. Plus, she deserves better and the sooner she's made aware of this the sooner she can get over it and get what she deserves. 

Don't tell her and you protect your father (does he deserve that? IMO, no), short-term protect your mother but long-term hurt her. 

Tell her and you protect her in the long-term, and your father will probably be very angry with you but that is his own fault. 

Of course, you could confront your dad first, saying ""tell mom about this or I will have to,"" and give him a week, at most, to get his shit together and confess."
"From personal experience, I would say contact your half-siblings. I hesitated to contact my dad's side of the family through Facebook (he died when I was 6) because my mom cut off communication with them in the 90's. However, when I reached out to them they were thrilled to hear from me and even cried. I hope it goes just as well for you, but even if it doesn't, what's the worst that could happen? They may say something rude or not respond and I'm certain you'll survive that. Plus, you'll likely regret not contacting them if you wait years. "
"it's weird because it's a little deceptive and manipulative. you're trying to present your point as if it were fair (""we"" don't smoke) and apply to both of you when in reality it only applies to her because only she smokes. that's what's weird about it. "
"I think it completely depends on you and what you value in a relationship/person. To me, the little things matter a whole lot. While my boyfriend and I certainly have separate interests, we have a lot of common ones. And we bond over these things. Like DnD, video games, nerdy movies, hiking, etc. Perhaps you can both find something new that you can bond over and be into together. But it's really nice that she's at least trying to be into the things that you're into and you should definitely return the favor."

"&gt; he seems to have a major problem with being honest with me, as well as having a track record as being a shameless womaniser and unfaithful to his ex girlfriend from when he was around 20yo. 

&gt; This was entirely new information to me and absolutely floored me. 

One of these things is not like the other.

You know what kind of person he is, you know he's unfaithful and has a terrible track record, and you know that he'd do the same thing to you. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour.

Stop kidding yourself and acting surprised. Cheaters never change, you knew what you were getting into and would have to delusional to not suspect anything. He's telling you who he is, you need to stop hearing what you want to hear and listen. If you date this person, they *will* cheat on you.

"
"Did your husband know his grandparents abused his mother when he chose to stay with them after his mother's suicide attempt? 

I'm not blaming him, he was a teenager who just wanted a stable home where he didn't have to be the adult. But I'm sure his mother felt betrayed by that decision (no matter how justified it may have been), and it would've been even more painful if he knowingly chose the people who made her childhood hell. 

It sounds like she never grappled with her childhood abuse. That kind of anxiety, fear, etc at a young age shapes a person's brain. Forever. And even if she can logically see that her parents treated her son kindly, it still probably hurts that he continues to have them in his life so closely her mom was the officiant at your wedding.

"

FUCK DAT BITCH!
"STOP.   Please.  Just stop.

Don't make this complicated.

After 4 years, either you need to keep moving forward, or you need to cut the chain.  You guys need to buy one house, or break up.  Buying two houses?  With a guy you've been dating 4 years?  Because you two have no idea where you stand?  

If you think you want to be with him, one or both of you should rent for a few months and figure that out.  

I think you're going to realize you need to move on.

But please, please, please don't buy two houses and try to continue to perform CPR on the relationship. If you are buying separate houses at this point it's time to break up.

I'm sorry to be Debby Downer.  But I'm afraid you're going to spend another 4 years figuring this out.  It's time to move forward or move apart."

"He described that relationship as “perfect” No fights, “she did everything for me and listened to me” 
It was a red flag, and he said almost the same thing for the other two after that (who were also coincidentally Muslim)

You’re right, religion has nothing to do with it. I was just pointing out that the only way for him to be happy would be to find someone that revered him as a god, didn’t talk back, etc. I said this after the 10th time he mentioned the perfect relationship. (It was a slap to the face for him to constantly bring it up during fights)

Sorry for any offense!"
Hah funny 
"The other woman definitely came after, I never once looked or flirted with other women. I was loyal and truthful because that’s what commitment is!"
Then either get therapy if you need help accepting it or realize this is a dealbreaker for you and move on from the relationship. 
Chatting is one thing.  The “cutesy names” is a whole different level.  So is prioritizing the relationship with her over yours.  Ignoring you on your birthday?  Unacceptable.  Period.  
"Holy guacamole YES this guy was emotionally abusive. A liar and a manipulator. 

The only advice I can give you is 1) Stay broken up. He will not change, so don't you dare expect anything to be different should you return., except maybe in the beginning as he tries to reel you back in. 2) Get closure from yourself, not him. This one sucks, because it's hard. So often we hope someone will reach out to us and say sorry, or make things right. Because that'd be the right thing to do, right? And we deserve it, right? Well, yes. But that's not how things work. If you couldn't count on him when you were together, don't count on him (for closure) when you're broken up. He won't give it to you. 

Do your best to never speak to this guy again. If you have HR, talk to them about him. Try to work somewhere else.  "
I think you should come clean but make it like......”it’s a funny story......” but definitely come clean soon! Update us. 
"My husband is ordained (ULC haha) and it turns out I can do flowers (did my own flowers for our wedding).

Just saying. :D"
This isn't your problem.   She's making her choices as an adult.
"Don't listen to this person, telling you it's your fault he lies. What would happen if he said ""I want to name the baby after the name my ex and I picked out"", instead of lying about it. Would you say no? Hell yeah. However you seem to really want things to work with this guy, so I'm sure you'd think about it, maybe compromise. Then again maybe not. No self-respecting woman is going to let a guy name their daughter something they picked out with their ex without some thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not your fault he lies. People have difficult conversations all the time and if he respected you, he'd be honest. He needs to take responsibility for how he treats you. This idiot is victim shaming."
Maybe you would have more luck internet dating. A lot of the sites use an algorithm that will connect you with folks you are (in theory) compatible with. 
Sorry OP but its the beginning of the end. 
"Then go get a check up, stop porn and work on your relationship..if you don't this will happen"
"I was in a similar situation. I used tinder because I never really dated and I needed to learn how to talk to people. It gave me a pretty strong crash course in the level of tomfoolery that exists in the dating world currently. Everyone is looking for something different and it took me a while to learn to narrow my search. I’m not saying to lower your expectations on what you want, but don’t expect things from people on the internet. If the conversation isn’t there in the app don’t pursue it. Just weed them out and move along. You don’t owe anyone a date and you certainly don’t owe them sex. If they aren’t willing to have a meaningful conversation with you or they aren’t looking for the same things you are, then it isn’t worth your time. 

That being said I have found a few people that were exactly what I was looking for at the time and we were able to have meaningful conversations and really enjoyed each other’s company. "
He says it will be very costly to me. it will also take a long time to go through fully.

"If she's at all worried about him going behind her back to use this name anyway, they shouldn't be having kids in the first place."
"That's the mature way to look at things. It's just at least for me, people that you really connect with and love don't come around very often, and so when they do, you want to keep them around. Thanks for your input!"
"He's ashamed of it. Not that that justifies shady behaviour, but it does explain it somewhat."
relationships takes two not one.
"In my anecdotal experience, women seem to know at an earlier age whether or not they want kids.  Society puts pressure on women to make being a mother (and thinking about being a mother) a big part of their lives.  It's getting better, but it's still a reality that in many cultures little girls are handed baby-dolls and asked how many kids they want, while little boys are handed trucks and asked what career they want.  And biologically, women have to come to a decision a little earlier than men.  All this to say - I believe that your boyfriend just truly hasn't fully thought about this yet and doesn't know, and probably doesn't see why he should have to decide now.  

So the key here is to try to get him to think about it soon, and think about it seriously, before you invest a whole bunch more years and emotions.  In other words, I think you shouldn't wait longer to start having these serious conversations just because you're young.  If you sit down and talk, you might realize he's much more of a ""no,"" and was just hesitant to take a firm stance.  If he's really a ""maybe,"" talk about how you picture your lives, and how kids would fit into that.  Another thing is that young men have often had basically no exposure to babies and kids, so you could try babysitting together or volunteering together with kids (try to find kids of varying ages and for longer than just an hour or two), and see if that helps clarify his feelings.  "
If it's really bothering you then you two are probably incompatible. The only way I can think about this working is if you accept he's a liar and learn to live with it.
"Yes he is still denying the trans and Instagram topics. If he does like trans women with penis, does that make him bisexual?"
"Do you think maybe he just liked the name and didn’t want to tell you where the idea came from because he didn’t want to you flip out? Not saying he should’ve kept that from you necessarily, but I feel like your life wouldn’t have been any different if you didn’t know.

If he and the ex are not actively talking, that’s good. I’d probably just ask him why he likes the name so much. Maybe try to find out if he still has feelings for his ex. "

"She's pushy, annoying and desperate sounding.

That being said, he's also shady as shit. 

Honestly OP would be better off without either of these terrible people in her life.

The ex deserves to have a BF who is a sneaky cheater."
"""Hey, if we're going to lend you this money, we need to have a conversation about your finances."" And don't give him that money until you have that conversation. "
"&gt;She told me that I was being too picky and we had a good thing going on.

Yeah, from her perspective, but she isn't the only one allowed to have opinions here.  She disagrees with you, but that does not mean you're wrong.  She may not care about those things, but you are totally reasonable to want someone more on the same page in regards to your points.  She's not wrong about the tinder match thing, but that's not what's going on here at all.  You have several valid points that show a clear incompatibility as a couple."

"Talk to your friends and explain your feelings to them. 
They are after all your friends and surely only want your best. 
Maybe you can find a middle way, so no one gets totally left out. "
"The problem here is like you said - following women in your area. It sounds like a fetish and lots of people have fetishes, but he's taken to finding women, that meet his fetish, *in the area in which he resides*. Aside from the subject, it is also odd that he has a secret account under a fake name - that raises my suspicion 10 levels highter. I would 100% talk to him about this. 

&gt; Is it wrong of me that I'm turned off by this? 

No. It would be wrong of you to say poor things about trans women, or to say men should not be attracted to them, but you are not wrong for being turned off by this fetish. Thousands of people all over the world are turned off by their partners fetish and consider certain fetishes a deal breaker. It's okay. 

However, please don't refer to trans women as ""shemales."" That is quite a derogatory term.

As for does it mean he likes penis, not exactly. I assume he isn't following gay men, just trans women, so I'd think it has less to do with penis and more to do with trans women in and of themselves."
"Why bother?  The best way to maintain your pride is to appear indifferent to her and him.  Any attempt at inquisition, or seeking revenge, or anger, just makes you look weak.  (You may feel weak but don't act weak!)   From this second forward, neither of them exists.  Block them everywhere, don't take his calls.  They are dead to you.  Act as if you are absolutely above caring about their petty smarmy little lives.  It'll be hard but in the end you'll get over it quicker if you keep your pride, at least in public.  You can cry like a baby in private wikth your friends."
why would they have to smoke indoors?
Do you tease her a lot? 
"Yeah, sure that can happen (rare, but still). 
And it’s a good thing that you’re going to therapy for it because I don’t think completely cutting out sex is the solution. It sounds like some deeper psychological stuff that needs to be dealt with. 

In the mean time, being completely honest with your boyfriend and telling him why you don’t want to have sex is what I would do. That doesn’t mean you can’t do all the other fun stuff and can even bring some excitement into the bedroom because you’ll have to be creative. 

&amp; If it is a deal breaker and he doesn’t understand then it looks like it’s time to move on. 

This is all just my opinion.. not a professional or anything ! "
Twenty bucks says that his decision to seek out other climbing partners happened after he was reunited with this girl.
"Your father is an adult who makes adult choices. It sounds like he is not fiscally responsible at all. His financial problems are not your financial problems and you should not lend him any money. I know that the "" but it's family"" guilt can be rough to deal with but you do not have to give him any money. ""That doesn't work for us"" on repeat is a good mantra. Good luck, op. "

"Okay, first of all, is he willing to find alternate legal routes to the advantages that marriage does give you? Will you have medical power of attorney over the other? Are you planning on having any shared assets, and if so, how would those be protected? 

Second, what is he actually afraid of? Has he told you, or has he just given you some doom and gloom about how marriage hurts men? Does he even really know himself? 

Finally, you don't need to accept this. If nothing changes, it's okay for you to change your mind and decide that you don't want to be with someone who won't make a legal commitment to you. What you want is valid, and I hate that you're trying to shove it down. "
"It’s new territory for me. I don’t understand why a straight male is into penis or a woman with a penis. I would understand it more if he was into a trans woman who had a vagina but he’s into women with penises. I’ve been with him for almost two years and to all of the sudden learn that my boyfriend likes penis is shocking and idk how to feel about it. 

Like I said, I have nothing against trans and men who like trans. It’s just very new territory for me and I don’t like the fact that he has another Instagram account and that he lies about his interests. "
"Other commentators have already given an explanation, so I'll just add it would be really nice if you could edit you post and comments to remove this slur"
"Okay, I'm not disagreeing with you on any of that. Like I said, you're entitled to feel the way you feel.

As for why he's into women with penises, all I can say is that sexuality is complex. People are into all kinds of things. However, he needs to stop treating trans women as fetish objects and going behind your back about it."
"well it sounds like this relationship may be done for. that's ok not every relationship ends in forever. you have learned a lesson in not presuming somebody is going to be an abusive or whatever else like your ex was. you have to get past your hangups if your going to move on. another note is that such a reaction to what is really a minor statement does make him sound quite insecure in the first place so something like this was probably gonna happen sooner or later. learn your lessons, realize you cant project the actions of past bf's on to your current u til they give you a reason to distrust them."
"&gt;someone famous online in that gaming community.

Probably got tired of being one of his 'groupies' but still pines for a chance with him while having you as a back up plan/safety net. Time to get out. If it's going to cost you money, it's going to cost you money. Divorces aren't cheap for a reason. "
"Oh yeah, its just a tool. I always keep some just in case. I get over having a super libido pretty quick anyway"
I can agree with this! I think I would understand it more if he was honest about it.

Where did I say it wasn't natural or that she should be judged for it...?
"&gt;we’ve decided to lend him the £2000

Well if your mind is made up. I'm sure your father means well, but there's one thing a family member can do, is they can leverage their familial love to either delay payment or cancel the debt altogether. Something that a bank won't do for him. I've been there. If you lend him the money, have the mindset that he'll either repay you in some other way other than cash, or just treat it as a gift. I wish you were in a better position to just give 2000 quid away, but that's just where you are now. Pet ownership may have to wait a couple more months. "
"&gt; If I say yes I get to finally fuck his girlfriend and he’d be cool with it but I risk him trying to do things to me while if I say no I miss the opportunity to finally fuck his girl and possibly put a strain on our friendship. 

Really? Threesomes are exactly that: about three people. 

Just tell him that you're not interested. Srsly, I feel really bad for this guy that you're THIS into his gf.
"
"Why do you wanna get married so badly? You can also build a future together without getting married right? I’m wondering why you want to get married, so he is fully committed? I think you need a good talk with him and also ask him about this in particular. If you really see a future with your boyfriend, and you think he is the one you should consider if getting married is that important. I think marriage is not the ultimate commitment that some want.. its also the little things like getting a pet of buying things together. But of course do what you think is best for you!! "
"Thanks, I wasn't sure if many people would be aware of how OCD works. 

Unfortunately this notion is already in my head. That he should not have gone in own his own mindset. It's a terrible narrative I've written for myself where I have him close enough trusting that this wouldn't happen and it did. Especially because I let him know once sex seems scary and in the first month (feels forever ago) of our relationship, when we started poking around, I said don't go in. And because of all this I can't be with him now.

But I'm well aware, that in the moment I was on board. When he entered me, instead of freaking out, I got the lube so he could do it again with ease. The good feeling I got afterwards. Also the fact that I've mentioned that I WANT him to f*ck me as part of dirty talk before (can't remember for the night of). Also that my hymen was going to stretch eventually and the constant pressure would let his tip enter (did not occur to me until today). Also that if having sex is even a big deal, especially when I let him finger me... In the moment it happened, it was just another act.

These two narratives are fighting each other and my mind is in over drive. One paints me as a victim which is so scary and that feeds the OCD. I'm not sure what to do here...

May I ask why you cried during your first time? 
"
You are absolutely NOT overreacting. Maybe you should tell her you are going to sleep with your ex in one bed. Lets see what her reaction is
"He may not even know himself. This totally sucks, and I imagine it’ll be an uphill climb to get back to a place where you feel good about yourself again. But you have to lose his dead weight before you can begin the climb. If he did stick around you’d always be worried and insecure and you’d feel worse about yourself for not having all his love. "
"&gt; he says ""yes, at some point"",

Would it be helpful to shift the conversation towards something like ""what things do you want to see/do/accomplish before having kids"", and ""what things do you or we need to work on before kids"".  [and write it down]

Not that it's your job to manage or coach him, but perhaps it will help you see if he's thinking about his life, where kids fit, and is actively moving towards that (or actively resolving personal or relationship issues that might be holding him back).

Then you can make a decision for yourself, and your life, if this is going anywhere."
Also agreed. Chores and errands and life stuff take up like 75% of my free time most weeknights.
"No that's not okay.  

If you are upset about your boyfriend's behavior with his ex, deal with that.  Do not try to get even by acting inappropriately.  Talk to him again.  If you feel that he has prioritized communication with his ex and has been hiding their interaction, tell him that it's not working and it's time for you to break up."
If he wants to be able to receive oral sex and have it just be about his pleasure then he should be just as willing to do the same in return.
"Couples counseling sounds like a good idea here. And I think you and Sid are going to have to come to some kind of compromise where you back way off on these events. It sounds like you should probably attend occasionally, but otherwise let him make your excuses for you - you work hard and so you can’t be at everything. He could probably stand to miss some events too so that you two can have couples time and work on your marriage. "
Ok. But is she pushy 
"All relationships are wonderful except when they aren’t. 

Your partner sounds like he needs therapy before he can be an actual contributing member in your relationship. Shutting down and absolutely refusing to talk is unhealthy and stunted maturity. If you can’t talk about your issues, nothing is ever going to change for the positive. The fact that he treats you this way and doesn’t see any issue with it is alarming. "

"I just wanted to say, that while you have a long way to go, good job recognizing you have a problem.

You need to break up with her asap."
I hope you update. I don't know you but I'm concern.
Sounds like you were jealous. 
"The things I'm most worried about are my electronics... TV, computers, monitors, video game systems... that's a lot to carry around or leave in my car at all times. Aside from those, my cats (2 cats are mine 1 is hers), but she wouldn't harm an animal... she's not that fucked up.... she may let them loose 'accidentally' though..... "
[removed]
"It’s not okay for her to even *consider* that putting herself into a situation like this would be okay. 

This is messed up dude, she’s screwing you around. Leave."
"How can I start this conversation which feels true and honest to me but not hurtful to him. He truly is a nice guy. This could imply no consent and I think it's a horrible thing to put on a person. Especially when they will carry that guilt...he has no idea whats going on in my head for this reason. 

I don't know how to talk about it when I can't make up my mind. I have two narratives, one where my trust was broken and the other is go with the flow - I did and so did he in the moment and let it go now. Do better communication next time but let it go now."
This. Better to have some rumors than to actually be on the verge of divorce because she doesn’t want to say no. 
"Tell her you've realized you are an abusive, toxic person, and you won't continue to see her. Then cut all contact, and don't let her come back to you.  
If you leave the decision in her hands, well... you've manipulated and conditioned her to think you are her everything and she cannot survive without you. You'll get your little ego boost and affirmation that you aren't *that* bad if she decides to stay, as she most likely will; this is an extension of your manipulative behavior. Perhaps you wish to feel desirable by her and pursued by her when you break up, but if she does this, it is only because you have brainwashed her. Know that, and avoid it.

I see a lot of posts congratulating you on realizing you're a terrible, shit human being. I shall refrain. It's not something to congratulate, or to be proud of, buddy. Realizing you're a toxic abuser is, for you, the bare minimum of... being a self-aware person. Not even a remotely half-decent one. Get yourself NOT into therapy, but into an abuser's recovery program. You'll use therapy and whatever diagnosis you get to explain and justify your abusive behavior, instead of change it, because that is what abusers do. I don't know how to find one such program, but Lundy Bancroft, author of ""Why does he do that?"", among others, recommends abusers don't go to therapy because of this reason; he works with abusers in court-mandated programs and has 30 years of experience with men like you that have not yet noticed they're abusive. While you likely have some sort of personality issue, therapy isn't necessarily the answer. The problem with abusers is often with their ethics, morals, values and beliefs.

Your language, as another poster says, sometimes distances you from your actions. You say ""I feel \[...\] that I have also been gaslighting"" instead of ""I have realized I have also been gaslighting"". You don't ""feel"" it, you absolutely *have* been gaslighting.  I recommend taking responsibility for your thoughts, feelings, and actions. I recommend evaluating your value system and thinking of what kind of values and beliefs you have that makes you treat your significant other as a possession, as an object and inferior, instead of as a person and an equal."
"So little backstory: My ex was not only abusive, but also highly manipulative. He pretended to be a completely different person until he ""trapped"" me. So ever since I've been super cautious about who I let near me, and who I introduce to people near me. I wasn't ready for my parents to meet him and yeah, that's completely my issue and I need to work on that.  


However it doesn't mean that I don't love myself, I'm just incredibly, overly self protective. "
"Also can confirm. Didn't really talk him out of leaving the relationship since it wasn't brought up, but I did notice him mentally/emotionally checking out of it. I tried stonewalling and dragging him to the courthouse. He looked so miserable being there. I never want to feel that kind of dejected in my fucking life."
I don’t see a single reason based on your post that you can’t go back to school if you’re a housewife and have the available time anyway. Also people can and do survive on 20k a year. You’ll be able to qualify for food stamps and insurance and you can split an apartment with a roommate or rent a room for someone. So that’s not why you haven’t left because you could if you needed to.

"I literally have no idea what's going on specifically with your father or with X. But what I can tell is that you're not in a good place. You need to love yourself before you can really offer love to others - that's what partnership requires, someone who can actually get their sh!t together and be there for someone else. Because in marriage or long term relationships, it's not each party gives 50%. It's each party gives 100% all the time so that if someone is slacking/lagging behind, or not doing well, the other person picks up that slack. That's true love.

I think I agree with X. He wants you in his life, but it's not a good fit for either of you right now."
"So any threesome is a collaborative experience. 

Have a talk to both of them and their expectations. If they match yours and you think it’ll be fun, great. Enjoy your threesome! 

If they don’t, or you might be expected to do things you don’t want to do. Or they might want to do things you don’t want to do, maybe give it a miss. 

This isn’t a chance to fuck his girlfriend, it’s a sexual experience for all three of you. 

Based on what you said and what you expect, I expect this would be a bad idea in this case. "
"The best advice I could give is stop sharing and giving into janes tactics. Jane uses peer pressure to get what she wants from you and she continues to do it because it works all the time. You’re going to have to assert yourself and stop letting her walk over you and take advantage of you. Don’t tell her something you don’t want to because she’s grilling you, or to convince you to go on a day trip you don’t want to. Be firm, you don’t have to be a bitch or rude, just choose a stance and stick to it. You also don’t have to justify your actions to her, which you do a lot.

“I’m not doing/going/sharing xyz, sorry!”

That needs to become your best friend!

Once you do this I think you’ll find she’s a lot less interested in you and will have less to feed on."

At least one of these claims is a lie."
"Oh, I would love to. But that won’t get me anywhere. Glad I am not the only one who feels this is a scream worthy situation though :) "
Because he’s selfish? An asshole? Didn’t realize what he was doing?
I got halfway through OP's post and wanted to punch his face out. 
"This is going to be hard for you to do (because it might be a deal breaker), but if you want to have kids, then you owe it to yourself and him to find that out and move on if he's not on board. There's no compromise on this issue.

It's going to suck to start over with someone else, but what's going to be worse? Break up now with someone whose longterm goals aren't compatible with your own or look back in 10 or 15 years when it's too late to have kids and your marriage is crumbling because you resent not having kids and missing your chance?

When you talk to him, he may be undecided and that's not a real reason yet to break up, but if he is adamant about it, you'd have to think long and hard about whether there's a future for you two and you can't count on ""changing his mind""."
"I remember reading the original post ... they were together something like 10 years?

I remember thinking ""fuck I can't be with her for that long""

I'm glad everything worked out for her.

In that story, he ended up living with her after the breakup for a while.... I really don't want to be in that situation but I may have no choice.... I also don't have a spare bedroom. We live in a 1/1..."
"If he truly cared about you as a friend he would respect your boundaries more. Its very easy to be selfish when it comes to love, and it seems like he is putting his own feelings ahead of yours. Even though you see him as an extremely close friend I think you should let him know one more time that you only see him as a friend and you are not comfortable with the way he treats you. If he listens and acts just like a friend, you are 100% NOT leading him on and should not feel guilty about anything, but if he refuses to listen I think you should put the friendship on hold and as hard as it may be try to spend time away from him. In any circumstance though, you should NEVER date anyone if you don't feel it on the inside. Like you said you don't need a reason not to date anyone. I hope this all works out for you!"
Dump him. He’s a dickhead. And a pretentious one at that. I hang out with smart people. We just talk about what idiots we are. And that’s more fun. Most importantly he’s not nice to you. You deserve someone who is kind to you. 
"She stayed with you in the hope that one day you would realize what you were doing and change.  Don't take that from her now, just apologize, go get some counseling, and stop.  You've taken the first step, now go get help and be better. "
"Also, your husband is pulling something that I see all the time as someone in recovery who works a 12 step program and has my own mental health issues. He’s trying to fix an internal problem externally. He’s blaming everything on the outside for how he feels when he needs to face the truth and realize that a new job or a new town won’t find him.

&amp;nbsp;

And you go along. You cannot tell me that you don’t enable on some way. You’re an equal part in this marriage and have a say and you have the option to tell him that if he quits you won’t be moving with him."
Your boyfriend is a dick.
"Thank you for your responses.  

I’m hopeful therapy helps.  I will try and take her lingerie shopping it sounds fun. "
Thanks for your input! I tend to lean this way as well.  
"Tinder makes sense but I'm not 18 yet, my birthday is in june, and I had to move far away due to family reasons"
"You should get rid. Say goodbye.
I understand the lad paying on a first date, or offering. But a year down the line and shes your girlfriend. Sorry to say but she sounds like a spoilt one to be honest.

You left your wallet big deal, if she actually respected you or had any Decency, she would gone. Awww it's ok dont worry about it, it's on me this time. Whatever you do dont pay her back. And break up. You'll thank me later. Because if you don't, you'll be kicking yourself in another year. "
"I tried breaking up with him few times but then I feel like I am doing the wrong decision. I wanted to have a life with him, explore the world, travel, work around and have a family with him. He also wanted all of this with me but now his family became just his dog. I don't know what else to do. 

My self-esteem is so low at the moment that I allow him to shout and treat me bad just because I want his attention. He used to be an angel for me and now it's a simply nightmare.
He doesn't kiss me if I don't kiss him, he doesn't cuddle or hug anymore for any reason like he used to - but pets the dog all the time.

I feel like I was left by a dog. Sounds pretty stupid to say that, I know. But even his parents agree with his dog obsession. "
Thank you for putting this way better than I did. I love this.
"Lol at being together for 31 months.... you're getting all your practice in for parenting! 

Me: how old is your baby?
Other person: 22 months,  14 days, 6 hours and 52 minutes... "
Hes whinging because you only have sex 2 to 3 times a week. COME ON. and you dont live together! 
"Actually not all opinions are weighted the same, especially unreasonable ones like yours. You should do some self-reflection and think is this the kind of girlfriend/person you want to be? Because you sound like an extremely insecure/controlling person. "
"^not very constructive. 
There’s nothing wrong with you :) I feel the same about many of my exes, some of whom I haven’t been with for 6 years. But it doesn’t come from healthy though patterns. I feel really ashamed when I think of my most recent ex, a lot of the time I’m not even sure why, it’s like I feel I embarrassed myself in the relationship and so I need to go back and prove to her that I’m not an idiot. Is it similar to that?"
"He's going to be dependent on you. He sees your guaranteed payment, and your work ethic, as his meal ticket. 

In five years, he'll still not have passed any classes, he'll still not have managed to get a better job, and you'll have two kids that he's, ""too tired"" to help with.

Move out yes. Get an apartment, your GED and a job, yes. But with roommates that aren't him "
"&gt;We used to get into my car in our days off and travel around, camp and do amazing things together, but now we don't do anything instead of watching stupid videos on YouTube every night again. We used to fuck all the time anywhere and now it seems like he doesn't feel any kind of appetite regarding sex. His happiness is surrounded by his dog and that all.     



I don't think your problem has anything to do with the dog. It's a symptom of your problem, sure. But not even close to being the cause.     



It sounds to me like your relationship has become stagnant and your boyfriend is withdrawing from it emotionally and physically. The dog is probably just his way of coping with that and a means of getting the affection he no longer seems to want from you.    



That sucks, and there really isn't a nicer way to say it, but it happens in relationships sometimes. I've been there. There's only one solution and it involves walking away before your resentment builds to critical levels, but this is definitely a boyfriend problem and not a dog problem."
"Oh, together like DATING.
Not together, together.
We only started living together like a month ago."
"Yeah I don't get the people in this thread. Obviously he isn't entitled to sex, but it's clear he didn't just wake up one morning evil, he's frustrated with a GF who doesn't want to be intimate with him at all. It sucks that she's got trauma about past pain but OP needs to learn that not every guy is gonna be cool with that."
"&gt;she has really really bad ADHD if you can't tell.

AFAIK, speaking as someone with ADHD, being an emotional vampire is not one of our symptoms. Don't let her use that as an excuse. "
"I'm 43 and not married. I'm not worthless. I adopted my daughter and have a really good job. I have multiple properties and good friends. I take vacations and make my own decisions. The facts are that I never met anyone who was good enough to me. It's no big deal. It's nobody's business. In fact, I don't know if I will ever get married or date again. Not because I'm an ugly ogre or anything, but good men don't really pop up in my radar anymore. It's nice not having to worry about a husband and his multiple issues or problems. I've never met a married couple that wasn't plagued with them. Just tell people if you ever get an update on the matter, you'll let them know. 28 is way to young to think everything is done in your world. "
"Welp. If you don’t have any tolerance for it, then this relationship is not for you. 

And he *knows* it’s wrong to do what he’s doing, that’s *why* he thinks it’s so funny. That’s the whole point. He might also get a kick of how much it bothers you, frankly. He’s not going to stop. "
"I agree with pretty much everything you said, she always says that she cares about me but then as soon as I say I gotta/wanna go, she goes into full on manipulation attention seeking mode. She is very depressed and has a lot of mental issues that go back to years and years of abuse and I understand why she is acting like this. Thank you &lt;3"
"&gt; Look, most **people** wouldn't be cool with a dead bedroom.

Not just guys, being brutally rejected and unwanted by your partner affects people of any gender. Most comments are treating the boyfriend like shit for expecting *sex with his own girlfriend*!"
Maybe they do. But normal men don't force it on someone having health and anxiety issues.
Having sex 2-3 times a week isn't a dead bedroom. 
"He's doing the right thing for both of you by distancing himself. I know it hurts but you'll have to accept it. He wants more than what you can give, so he needs to get over you, and he can't do that without space."
"Okay, good luck with everything."
"Definitely explain it to them first. It's clear that you are not returning the jacket because you don't like it; it's because it's too big and you can't wear it. If the store doesn't accept refunds, what would your parents rather you do? Keep the jacket in a closet and never wear it? Or sell it to someone who *will* wear it and use the money to buy something else you can wear.     



If you're upfront and honest with them and show gratitude for the thought, it's unlikely they'll be too offended."
"Yeah, this. I had a health problem last year that meant my partner and I didn't have sex for about three months. I felt terrible about it, but because he is a good person, he would regularly remind me that he is my partner and my health was the most important thing. Plus he'd joke about how he was catching up on all the new porn out there (this made me laugh, I would also jokingly ask about it). The point being that a good partner recognizes and respects your physical and mental limitations. A good partner wants you to be happy and healthy. I am not married, buy take that vow of for better or for worse seriously-life can be terrible sometimes and you want a partner who can support you and love you through the bad times. He is demonstrating that he will not be supportive when things go south. This dude is not a good partner. "

"You are not a sex toy, OP. You are a person with thoughts and feelings. You're not obligated to provide him any kind of access to your body if you're not comfortable. He doesn't have the right to an orgasm because you stay over with him. This is a 100% predatory. "
[removed]
I know my man is responsible. I don't work right now because I work on a warehouse where I had to lift heavy stuffs. He gives me everything and believe he do really love me. We love together now (Started living together a month ago). Thanks for suggestion and comments. 
It is never a good idea to cheat. Nor is it justified. 
"You need to remember that the dog is not to blame here, and by casting the dog as the villa, you are helping to push your boyfriend away. I say this because your boyfriend will see the resentment you have towards the animal, and it will cause him to resent you for it (it's a vicious cycle).

As I say, the animal is not to blame. Your boyfriend is. As are you, but to a lesser extent. Communicate, don't fester. This is the only thing you can do. Write down all the things that bother you - but please, don't blame the animal, so you can work through it.

You said that you found the animal, and so don't know it's history. You don't know if it's been abused, and you don't know if it's behavioural issues are due to neglect, abuse, or just bad training. This means that it may need more work than you realise to get it to stop doing things you don't like.

I wish you luck, but urge you to stop blaming the dog for the issues that it cannot cause. "
"I can sort of understand what his logic might be. Like how it sucks when your family try to teach you to drive, but not when someone unrelated does. It could be that he feels more comfortable teaching someone that he doesn't have to also maintain a romantic relationship with - perhaps he feels he can be harder on her, more critical.


That said, the rest of OP's post is a bit dodgy, and I wouldn't be surprised if I'm being too generous here. And at the end of the day, if he wants to cheat then stopping him having a female climbing partner won't prevent that. This is really about whether OP thinks she can trust him ever, not just now."
Yes she is playing you
"Snooping around each other’s phones and lying to each other. You are worried he is speaking to his ex? 

This does not sound like a family ready to have kids. "
"As a respect, I still had to see them. Thank you. 😘"
"So the issue isn't that him and his ex picked out a name and he liked it so much he still wants to use it. It's that he lied to you, you don't trust him, and snooped.

For one, I think you're getting way too upset over the fact his ex came up with it. But, he also should have been honest from the get go and said ""Well, when I was dating ex we came up with this name I REALLY liked, Addie Mae, how do you feel about that?"" and given you the chance to shoot it down and come up with your own name. For context, I dated a guy awhile ago and we were telling each other our favorite baby names and he told me what he wanted for a boy, and I fell in love with the name more so than anything I found to like at that point. We've been broken up for years, I have no romantic feelings but I also wouldn't go asking him for permission to use said name on any child I have. I wouldn't even bother telling my partner I got it from him, because it doesn't matter that he's the one that introduced me to the name, it's just the fact I like the name, even years later when I no longer like my ex.

So that's why I think you're overreacting a bit, but if he hadn't asked her for permission, it would have made it a lot less personal and more leaning towards its a name he fell in love with separately from her mentioning it, like me. Basically, we both found a name we loved from another human, who happens to be an ex, instead of the internet or a baby book. It happens. My favorite little girl name I found on a grave stone in the cemetery my grand mother is buried in.

You need to rethink having a baby with this man right now. You don't trust him, you snoop, and he lies to you still. If you want to make this work you need to build up trust, having a baby will not fix that, it will just make the stress of this more stressful."
"Thanks for your input! I really dont know him or his relationship. All I know is what hes telling me. You may be right, it could be him, but regardless of the reason or who or whats at fault, he has to evaluate his situation and make decision. "

"I'm 42 and would love to be married (not really sure why - still trying to figure it out) but I think my family have given up. My parents are in their 80s and I feel really sad they will probably never see me get married. My brother has (very unfairly) told me I should get married (to whom?) so dad can walk his daughter down the aisle. Yikes.  I feel so sad that I won't give my dad what my brother says he wants, but on the other hand I don't want to ""marry in haste, repent at leisure"", especially at 42+.

28 is way young, like everyone else has said. You should definitely press for the Kitchen-Aid. I used to say I would get matching crockery when I got married, as a present, but at 35 I finally said ""fuck it"" and bought my own damn crockery. "

"I personally was at a point of not knowing if I would live or die and all I could worry about was my daughter.  I made my close friends promise to look out for her and never let her forget how much I loved her.

Also, why waste energy worrying about something you can't change? It's done. There is no point whatsoever in worrying about it now. 

Out of curiosity, is your boyfriend a virgin?"
"I just want to share that I went through something similar. 

A combination of 2 separate health issues left my sex life almost non-existent for over a year. It was TOUGH and I felt all the things you did. My bf was also very frustrated but NEVER acted the way yours did (except at the very beginning he was frustrated because he felt rejected bc neither of us knew what was going on). 

It took a year for my health to get back to normal and a year almost to get my mental health and thoughts around sex back to normal. I remember trying to have sex because I felt so bad it had been 6 weeks and I broke down crying and he told me to never pretend to want sex again because to him it felt like rape. 

There. Are. Men. Out. There. Who. Will. Respect. Your. Body. 


This man is not one of them and frankly him forcing you to do things against your will, guilting you, this is frankly defined as sexual abuse in my mind. "

"Okay, don't you find it to be a double standard that he wants you to be a virgin while it's fine that he's slept with multiple women? Is he worrying about how he ""stupidly"" lost his virginity before he met you?
"
"If you are worried he may use you for sex... then don't have sex. You don't have to sleep with him, you can wait until he makes things official. That's how I prefer it anyway.

I would ask him out, I mean, why not? If he says no, ask questions and determine if you really want to be chasing a man who may not want to be in an official relationship right now.

If you just want to hookup, fine, but don't expect him to come around and immediately have deeper feelings for you just because you have sex.

Good luck!"

"I see. I can somewhat understand their concern, but they need to back off. You guys are on the younger side for getting married, but you're not teenagers. You can make this decision for yourselves.

Think in terms of who you know your fiancé to be, not worries from his parents. Do you think he'll make a good husband? Is your relationship healthy and stable? Are your goals in life compatible?

Also, legal stuff. If worst comes to worst and you split up, will you be better protected if you were married? I know it's not fun to think about, but it's important.

I'd suggest some kind of relationship/pre-marital counselling to help you guys figure out what you want. 

Sorry for how long this reply is getting, but if you're not sure then it would be good to wait and see what kind of father he ends up being. In my experience, it's babies rather than marriage that make or break a couple. "
"Yeah I second distracting yourself with healthy life choices. Hobbies are great as long as they’re relaxing. Playing guitar is thereputic. I also agree that seeing a psych is a great idea, just want to make it clear that that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you."
"Just to clear one thing: I wasn't being ironic with my question, I really wanted to ask you.   
Well, I treat my pet better than anyone cause you know, he is my baby lol.   
Indeed this dog needs training, and it's one thing to be upset because of the mess and another thing to be upset because your bf neglects you. "
You're incompatible. You might want to consider breaking up so you can be with someone who matches your drive
"Don't see him after school today. Break it off for good, cut all ties what so ever  and inform your parents about the situation. They way he is treating you is manipulative and abusive and neither of you are benefitting from this situation. Remember you did nothing and he is just feeding off of you like a leech. "
"It's possible your mother suggested the KitchenAid because she gave up on you getting married, but it isn't the only possibility. You asked for one for your birthday after all - was it because you'd given up on yourself getting married? I imagine not; I imagine you asked for it because it would be a convenient thing to get, and you didn't want to wait for marriage before getting it. Your mother at the time answered ""not until you're married"" because that was what the tradition was. But now it's possible that after a few years of you not getting the KitchenAid she's realized how unfair this tradition is, to make it a condition that you should get this very convenient thing only when you get married. It's a tradition that made sense when getting married was how girls left their parents' household; getting married = first time having your own household = get household items. Except nowadays getting married and leaving your family to build your own household aren't related anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So maybe she just re-thought her previous position, and hasn't so much ""given up on you getting married"" as decided that you probably aren't getting married in, say, the next two years, but she wants to/thinks it would be fair to gift you with a KitchenAid before that.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe talk to her about this? If you have a good relationship with your mother it should be a nice conversation; at worst she \*has\* given up on you getting married and this conversation will allow you to clear the air and make her understand your feelings about this and how you haven't given up on yourself getting married, and it's hurtful to think she has. More likely she will reassure you that she's come to accept that you'll be fine whether you're married or not and she doesn't need to hold out for that outcome before deciding you're finally ""finished"" as a daughter/parenting project.

&amp;#x200B;

As for your grandmother, her behavior seems to me like it's average grandmother-who's-slipping behavior - as in, she considers marriage an important milestone of adulthood, and so it's important information for her whether you've reached it, so she asks about it; and she asks all the time and repeatedly because she's old and very old people tend to repeat themselves. Her not going to your wedding is completely logical if she's too old to travel much. My grandfather didn't go to his brother's funeral because it was too far away... Travel isn't a trivial concern for certain old people.

&amp;#x200B;

I see two possibilities here: you're taking way, way too much to heart comments that are fundamentally well-intentioned and seeing criticism where there is only mild insensitivity at worst, OR you are correctly reading your mother and your grandmother's behavior, and it all seems innocuous when described in your post but there is actually much more behind there that you haven't told us. Either way it sounds like you're unhappy with your life as it currently is (whether because you are over-anxious, or because you are legitimately being undermined by your family), that could be something to focus on. You could consider therapy if it upsets you a lot."
This is so true. And people arent saying it to make yoi feel better. Its because as a parent you get it.
"Yeah I take the ""I wanna die comments very seriously"" and she does them much less frequently and she is definitely getting better mentally but I still take the ""jokes"" seriously. When the incident happened I was able to help her out of it so for now I think she won't be doing anything suicidal. If she does something again I will probably contact authorities regardless, although I'm scared they'll treat her badly and that she'll refuse to listen to them or anything like that. The police showing up would probably give her a panic attack, after she broke up with her boyfriend she had panic attacks a few times everyday although the panic attacks don't happen nearly as much, she's very depressed still but it's getting better."
That seems like such a silly reason to give away a perfectly good kitchenaid but glad it worked out for you! I've had mine for about 5 years and it shows no sign of having any sort of issue.
"You don't.   You can swing for the fences but don't expect this to go over well.

&amp;#x200B;

I can understand that, but nowhere here do you nod to the feelings of the person you are in a relationship with. "
"Bit of a repost. Hope it helps. Please stay gone. 

So, first off, congratulations on leaving and planning so well. Please don't let your guard down. Maybe he really doesn't suspect a thing. Maybe he does. But don't get overconfident in your ability to stealth mode. Make sure New Roommate doesn't call up. Make sure New Bank stuff is going to a P.O. box, etc. Don't move out solo, obviously. I recommend a password for family/friends in case he doesn't let you leave, something innocuous enough to come up over the phone but alerts them that shit is going down. Mine was something innocent but also something I'd not normally say. [I saw you have a password, but maybe someone else needs it.]

Basically, you don't breathe a sigh of relief until you are out permanently, deadbolting the door to your new place (that he doesn't know the address to) behind you. And even then, keep looking over your shoulder. I did for several years. Sucks, but I'd personally rather be paranoid and safe than dead. 

Also, tell everyone what he did. Everyone that you can stomach to tell, that is, or is appropriate. Tell them now, or tell them when you leave. The reason for this is it's harder to go back (with the added bonus of maybe helping another person). Really freaking strong people can leave abuse and just toss the match over their shoulder and never look back. When I left, I was not that strong. At first, moving is going to be awesome. No eggshells! No one locking you in a room! No abusive asshole! Yay! But at some point, one night, in your quiet, calm, non-violent new life...the loneliness is gonna slam into your ribcage hard enough to take your breath away. Which is the perfect time to do something stupid like romanticize him, un-block him and reach out, second-guess all your brilliant decisions. That's when you call one of your friends or family and have them talk you down off that ledge. If they know that he shook you and barricaded you, they will be a great stop-gap for when that idiot part of your brain starts telling you, 'it wasn't that bad.' **Yes, it was, stupid brain!** Those people will keep you honest, safe and alive. 

Because no matter how many times it took you to *try* to leave, stay gone. I don't care WHAT you have to do to cope, even if it's not super healthy temporarily, stay gone. Of COURSE I want you to go be awesome and exercise and take up new hobbies and do volunteer work to better yourself and keep your mind occupied. But most of us have to go feel miserable for a while. If you've got to take to your bed for a week or take a couple of people to your bed or crawl into a bottle of gin for a bit, IDFC IF YOU STAY GONE. I don't care if you're having full-on conversations with your teddy bear collection or you don't shower for a week. Then you'll be a slightly crazy, stinky person who is ALIVE because you stayed gone. Obviously, get your shit together and live better after a while, but do absolutely whatever you have to do to cope and **STAY GONE**. 

Your know you need to leave. You know. Go and stay gone. You can do it, get through this and get past him. BE SAFE. I would love an update. Just **stay gone**. Much luck and love to you. "
"It doesn't sound stupid at all. He's checked out of your relationship and the dog is where his attention is going now. Anyone in your position would feel the same.     



Please don't stay with someone who treats you badly and lowers your self-esteem. Why? You might feel that as you have been in the relationship a long time that you owe it to yourself (or him) to stick this out, but life is waaaay too short to spend any of it in a crappy and unsatisfying relationship.    



There are many guys out there who want to travel and explore the world. You are still young enough that you can find one! Let this guy have his dog."
"You need to initiate a discussion about whether you’re “in a relationship” with the person. It’s called “the talk”. Usually between several dates in and a few mo this of seeing each other, depending on how frequently you see each other and other dynamics, one or the other partner initiated a discussion that basically goes like this: “so, what are we/what are we doing?” “What do you mean?” “I mean, are we exclusive? Are we in a relationship? Do I tell my friends I have a boyfriend?” And it goes from there. It’s not incumbent on the other person to spontaneously tell you they like you; it’s up to one or the other of you to start this conversation, after you’re comfortable with each other and have been physically intimate (not necessarily sexual) and been together a lot. If you don’t do this, things can drag on for a long time and can be confusing, because until you have had this talk, you CANNOT assume you’re exclusive or dating the person seriously. Until this tan it could al be friendly hang outs with kissing. It is a weird system but it has worked for a long time. So get some liquid (or other) courage and ask where you guys are. "
Same I legit said what the fuck
"You guys aren't teens, you can ask him out and still be friends if he's not interested."
Lol or you could just ask.
Do you do it in front of your BF to manipulate him into paying everything for you?
"Gotcha.
Hmm.
Well, that's a fair question.  What's up with that?
I still think you are definitely enjoying each other and have a good relationship and are as close as you can get without seeing each other very often and being in school still. I don't think he's playing you, but you might be the more serious one. Maybe you can take some of the stress off of yourself by just realizing that you're a little more serious than he is that's all. 
Sometimes the issues before us are there to teach us something. Maybe you're supposed to be learning to move with the current. Definitely a useful skill to have in life:-)"
"If mistakes are the best teacher, you should be the biggest sage by now. I can't fathom how you arrive to such dumb ideas.

Just be genuine with the next girls."

"I'm going to go against the grain here and say that maybe she is just scared of losing your friendship. If you want to date her then I think you should tell her that and see if she is willing to give it a shot, if you just want to stay friends then I think you need to get some space from her so you can both process your feelings separately. "
"I don't think you can.

You can either solve the problems of living together TOGETHER, or you can move out and break up. Moving out is not actually solving the problems - just avoiding them.

fwiw, the first 3-4 months after my husband and I moved in together were the worst in our entire relationship. But we worked hard to solve those problems so we could cohabitate successfully. It's a big adjustment. Neither of us were used to living with other people and especially not romantic partners, so we each had to change and grow a lot. But we did and now are happy."
"You both were seeing multiple people at the time. You can't be sure until an actual test is done. Its $100 or less for the test, and it can be done completely incognito. "
"Your grandma wants to have a perfect little family where her grandsons get on and love each other. From her perspective, you're the one who's preventing that from being the reality.

I think you need to get through to her that it is your brother's behaviour that is the problem, not yours. Whenever she mentions the possibility of you guys reconciling you need to tell her in the most emotive terms exactly what he said and did to you and how it made you feel. If she won't listen to what you have to say, then tell her the topic isn't up for discussion unless she will listen to you. Tell her about it every time she brings the topic up. Make her confront how serious of an issue this is for you. Don't let her rug-sweep what has happened.

You have no obligation to have anything to do with your brother ever again, unless you want to. You don't owe it to anyone. Do whatever you need to to prioritise you're own mental and physical health."
"This is indeed sexist and wrong.

Climbing is about skill level and strength to body weight. Whether you are at a certain level or not has nothing to do with your sex, but your experience, training level, determination and after a certain point anatomical body type and natural talent. Ideally one would be slim (light), tall and wiry strong. Women climberd are often less strong, but also lighter, which is an advantage again. 

The point is that he could look for a partner at his level and could find someone of either sex. But OP's boyfriend is just as sexist as this commenter, as he wants a female climbing partner he can train. He doesn't want a partner, who will challenge and push him. He doesn't want an equal. Otherwise he would look for one. 

u/biglifequestions1234, I understand your unease and share it. "
"In his entire adult life he has only been alone for 2 months... He got with you after 1 month from a very long relationship. That's no time think for himself. If you moved on I can guarantee you he would, ""love"" the very next person that'll let him in."
The risk of him taking it if i dont take it straight to my partners is there. I didnt say that having to pay for a new one isn't a risk. I'm living on savings until I find a new job in the new area and having to fork out extra isn't really an option
Don't have a baby with someone you don't trust. 
"I'm just going to quote a fantastic suggestion from another redditer, u/barefootone: ""What is often wanted isn’t what you might think of as comfort but instead something a bit more simple. What people need is for you to join them in their place of unhappiness, not to worsen it, but to sympathise and understand and travel the road with them for a bit. It’s as if they want you to shadow them and experience the difficulty together.

All that is often needed is for you to be present, ask a few questions, repeat back what they are saying - perhaps using different words to show you understand and if they are angry about something, for you to be angry too - not for your own sake and not for you to be more angry and take the emphasis away from them, but to partner with them in the emotion.

Those things allow someone to feel understood and accepted and thereby also comforted. Sometimes we just need someone to “get it”. That alone can sometimes allow us to move on and move in to a different set of thoughts."""
"Yeah you're right that it's okay that not every relationship ends in forever, it's also not something I expect going into one luckily. It was a learning experience indeed. And for him, I'm not sure if it was insecurity, I do think it's a cultural aspect that plays a role in his reaction, but maybe you're right. We may never find out probably :) "
"I think she’s saying that you liked her when she didn’t like you, but she maybe would have given it a go since you grew on her romantically, but you ruined it by burning her and now she wants to reject you in turn. She doesn’t say she never liked you, just that she didn’t at first which seems more like an attempt at re-establishing emotional dominance. Which is petty af but not totally unheard of given that you hurt her when you cut her off. "
"Unplanned because you know, we don't use contraseptives. I mean, we expect it because we're sexually active.
I always thought of him changing, it's just that I do hope he won't change the way he treats me today. "
"Ah yes, the classic ""We're only getting one side of the story here!!!"" which funnily enough only ever comes up when it's a woman posting about a manipulative, shitty man. One side of the story is the whole nature of this sub, dude. Interesting how certain types understand this perfectly well until it's a woman posting about a creepy, awful guy. And deciding that another person is showing interest in you ""at an unconscious level"" is how creeps justify not listening to a woman's words and not taking no for an answer. If someone doesn't want you, you don't get to decide they ""really"" do, they just don't know it. That's a pretty disturbing attitude. "
I guess you should try to surprise her &amp; make her feel like a princess even just for a day. Maybe she's just bored on your relationship that's why she said the spark is gone. 
"Reading this, this is me:

&gt; After a 4 hour trickle truth session she admits that she made out with him and that was all.

omg, poor guy thinks thats what happened. I bet this girl had sex a loooot of times.

&gt; Turns out she slept with him and lied about that too. I realize the only way to move forward is to try my hardest to trust her believe that she can be trusted.

Yea, reality hits.

&gt; She told her whole world that I am a dick and emotionally abusive and I’m not quite sure what else.

Typical. All cheaters do this, one way or another. In their rotten mind, it helps them ""justify"" their awful behavior.

&gt; Now we are back together and she only ever talks about her male coworker all of the time, he likes every picture she posts on Instagram and if they are of her he’ll commen
t fire emojis and what not.

How can you be together with this girl.. I feel so sad for you. Damn. Spineless.
I really cannot understand how someone can put up with 5% of this behavior. Truly. Can someone enlighten me, honestly? What kind of thoughts go through your mind, when you know that someone put their penis in your gf mouth, had sex with her so many times, she lied you to your face like you are a piece of sh.. worthless garbage, and you still take her back? Just unbelievable"
"Do you think he's having second thoughts about being a parasite to you? I don't think he does, so don't feel guilty for setting things straight! 

Explain the situation at the police station, all of it, drug use, the leeching onto you, the bad mouthing you, stealing your card and the car key, ask you ex to testify that he was threatened to give the car back when you never agreed for your dad to do so and that you asked your dad to move out but he refuses (is he on the lease? Or are you the owner?) see what advice they're giving you.
Get out you owe him nothing at all!!!"
"Yes, 3 years is long enough to know someone and 2 years is long enough to take the steps he wants - if he wants to live together, he can move in and live with her for a year before they get engaged."
Why though? Why make up such an elaborate lie? I can’t understand it. He could of been out drinking all night and I wouldn’t of known any better. I just don’t understand... 
"He's definitely a liar, they don't let you out of jail after six hours if you have been in a fight and have cocaine on you. He's up to something dodgy and making up weird stories to try and cover his tracks. You just don't want to believe he's lying, but to us on the outside looking in it is so obvious."
Oh + his family is kinda close-minded people. They don't like spending time with someone who isn't part of their blood.

Forget about him not touching you. It sounds like You don't love each other anymore. 
"Yep, he’s letting you down easily. Nothing you can do from so far away. "
"Hi! I'm sorry this is happening-harmful cycles are pretty much the worst. So I hear you that you don't want to leave and she won't go to therapy. So here is my quick and dirty suggestion for both of you: If she is not willing to go to therapy, she MUST stop with the unfair fighting techniques. Full stop. If she does it, leave the room and get yourself away from her. She cannot keep doing it, it will destroy whatever trust and emotional intimacy you have left. On your end, agree to be more affectionate. Maybe not full sex, but more moments of you seeking her out for a hug or kiss, or a rub on the back, whatever it is that she responds well to. This is not a full solution. But if you both agree to this and try your best, it will help and at least you will have tried something to rebuild trust and intimacy to better address the other things that are happening. Best of luck to you:)"
Just needed to write it out..
"Literally nothing in your post made me want to tell you to stay. 

So leave. "
I am the opposite way around in my relationship. I spend too much time with them and get tired of their presence. We begin to get into small arguments and the time alone is good. 
"I would wonder why he thinks doing nice things necessarily means that he’s entitled to anything other than a “thanks, that’s nice of you”. I
would imagine an expectation of affectionate of reciprocity would be a good, healthy, mature response.

As a girl who can’t do normal levels of corniness, the expectation of a relationship means having a  “waifu” just broadcasts that there are people in the world who want to bang cartoon characters. Personally, I can’t take adults who want to bang cartoon characters seriously..."

He’s always going to be your brother but that doesn’t negate him being an abusive piece of shit. He’s in a cycle of abuse with your mom which is why she springs him from rehab which shouldn’t be a thing. 

You should contact a domestic violence resource in your mom’s area and ask for resources that could help your mom. And to have them confirm that your brother is a domestic abuser and domestic abuse isn’t confined to romantic relationships. 

But we can still get a fan boat and rub bacon grease on him. "
you need to learn how to read.
It’s not that easy
"&gt;and still expects me to keep up with him financially.

You don't have to keep up.  You have to live with your means.  That generally starts with a monthly budget that covers your expected expenses, a small contribution to an emergency fund and the rest is ""disposable""   Your expected expenses for the month may vary, should include an entertainment amount, and a prorated set-aside for larger regular expenses (e.g. tuition).  

Once you know what you can expect to save in disposable, you know the *maximum* you can plan to spend on excursions with your boyfriend in a given time period.   Tell him what that is and that the *two* of you have to make plans accordingly.  Either you go to places you can afford or he contributes more for the experience he wants.

You will not survive this relationship unless you get much better at that.  Get a  copy of *The Total Money Makeover* by Dave Ramsey and learn what it takes to be financially responsible."

"Jeez even I wanna dump her now after reading this. Little spoiled entitled brat. 
I can already see your future with her: you spending ALL your money and time on her, working all the time while she does nothing, only fun things what costs money. Your stress level is very high, you wan't to work less hours, work is killing you. But you can't call in sick or work less because you need to provide for the princess. And she'll get mad if you can't pay her expensive lifestyle. For everytime she's going out with the girls, treating all her friends with YOUR money. Driving her overly expensive car. "
"Sometimes it's literally a joke. Sometimes you name a person as one thing in your phone and then don't change it because you're lazy and it's kind of funny. 

Ask."
its a trap man. dont do it. 
"&gt; she's a serious academic so im very surprised with what she did 

Smart people have sex too, and cheat too. Being book smart doesn't mean they are emotionally intelligent or smart in other areas.

&gt; Im not very attached to her, and dont have any strong feelings, but still feels like i want this to continue so i get to the bottom of it somehow. 

You sure about that? This is a super contradicting statement

&gt; im very open minded tho, and wouldve considered the open relationship option if it was brought forward. 

Open relationships only work if there has been guidelines and rules agreed upon by both couples, so that's out of the window.

&gt; handsome and rich guy (me!) who makes 3 times what she does, and can have every women he wants, but wanted something serious with a smart and down to earth women, and ends up in that shitty situation. 

These things aren't usually factors on why someone cheats.

&gt; despite my feminist believes, i start to think women should never be trusted with anything in life, social and professional life.  

Horrible, way to generalize. You aren't a feminist if you think this. 

&gt; but this experience also highlights the fucking society we're in. people are unable to commit. unable to sacrifice even their basic instinct and desires. sadening. 

Yeah bro not everyone cheats, I get that you are downtrodden and upset but the world isn't really like that. Also \*saddening, sorry it was bugging me. Seems like you were typing from a phone?

My thoughts are it sounds like she has checked out of the relationship if she says she had sex with a guy, gave you the # of times, and said she felt a connection. Sometimes people cheat to back out of relationships they aren't feeling. It isn't a particularly nice way of doing it, but it sounds like you are really not interested either?

And just because someone is wealthy, good looking, and makes a lot of money doesn't mean they are going to get the perfect partner.

Dump her and rethink your approach on relationships."

"I, too, have this attachment! I thought it was a stupid gimmick, but now I am a convert. "
"Honestly to me, I haven't heard them say anything bad but they called my man Stupid, not thinking, it was his fault etc that I got pregnant.
My man told me he's trying to understand his parents' frustration because they were shocked or so and because he believes that if I finally give birth to our child, They'll accept it eventually. That's why I told him if I ever hear them say anything bad (again), I won't forgive them this time."
"Whew, dude your 15, don't worry about relationships, you have plenty of time for serious shit like that. Worry about what you want to do after high school, plan out a future for YOU and make it happen. There will be plenty of women and time for them your 15!!!"
Not worth it. Be with someone who lets you be yourself. She’s 20 but sounds 14
"yes, indeed. we never thought of abortion even if it's legal. My man told me he wants to build a family with me. His family is my only concern. "
"well I'm sorry to tell you we men cant have friends that we are attracted to. what we have are women (or men) that we want to stay close to incase our opportunity arises. rest assured it doesnt mean he was faking the friendship part, but it was second to his desire to be romantic with you. he either finally sees that's never to be or is stepping off to avoid making your bf feel uncomfortable. either way given his feelings he likely always had,this relationship you had has probably always been rough for him. sorry to say it and that you are likely losing your friend, but to him he is distancing himself from a romance he knows will never be."
"&gt; I already have the sheet/spaghetti attachment and want the pasta extruded but don’t want to spend the money!!!

The reviews of the extruder suggest it might not be that great, I'm afraid. Like I saw a video of some people trying it and they said if you wanted a pasta maker, get the sheet/spaghetti one because the results of the extruder were so inconsistent. "
"You are clearly afraid that she might be similarly tempted into some kind of infidelity.

You could ask her if there's anything you can do to help reinforce her decisions about not getting involved in such things."
"This sounds like a pretty normal situation of two people growing apart. It isn’t wasted time. 

You have a child together and it sounds like you mostly two get along, there’s just no romantic spark left. If you’re starting to mentally check out maybe it’s time to go your separate ways. It sounds like at this stage you two could still have a really healthy coparent relationship and both find romantic partners you’d be happier with.

"I've been in a relationship very similar to this..... when I was fucking 16. Sounds like she's been handed anything she wants for most of her life and/or is used to it and can't live without these accommodations. I've been living with my gf for almost 3 years now and our life has been perfect together. We both love each others company, we have the same interests and we've had maybe 2 real fights in our entire relationship, both of which have been resolved. My point being is that you can find a much nicer, kinder and more supportive partner. They are out there. If I was trapped in this relationship your describing (I'm also very allergic to cats heyooo lol) I mean I'd probably have constant anxiety attacks from my blood boiling so frequently. Sounds like she doesn't care too much about you or your side of things. Time to move on."
"If they were sleeping with other people while they were dating, that’s already a reason to believe that he has a hard time being faithful. I don’t think you need any more proof to justify your suspicions. He’s obviously been lying for a reason. "
"It's possible, but you'd be incredibly unlucky because it's the most incredibly small chance. The pill is about 91% effective with normal use, and condoms are 98% effective. Only true abstinence is 100% effective all the time. "
"ayyyyy, sad high five!"
"18 is the age of consent here, and yeah I'm also worried if he leaves her after finding out she's gonna go back to the 26 year old because he gives her attention"
I should have clarified -- these aren't first dates. I know first dates are just sort of.... first dates. What I'm looking for is basic compatibility. 
"To be honest, he probably has been cheating on you. It’s unlikely that you will get definitive proof, unfortunately. What you do know for a fact is that he’s been lying to you about something massive. "
Its definitly something to talk to him about. 
"Just curious, why do you think it's your responsibility to make her friends happy? It's one thing to be good to someone and other to be responsible for their happiness. "
"This made me question my own accent lol. Not American though, but close"
Nope. I think the problem is that he’s specifically following women in our area.
"I second this, if OP and her boyfriend aren't used to sleeping together it may just be a matter of getting used to it. When my boyfriend and I got together I really didn't sleep well when he stayed over, nowadays I ask him to spend the night if I need restful sleep cause having him there is the only way for me to be 100% relaxed and comfortable. 

That being said - if they've slept together plenty of times and it's just not working out or they won't adjust then two beds (or even two bedrooms) can definitely be the way to go. There seems to be a lot of stigma around getting separate beds as a couple but it doesn't have to be a big deal and if it solves the issue then it... well, then it solves the issue, can't think of a better way to put it. "
"Smoking is a pretty common deal breaker.

It might not be an instant one and done rule, though. Like, ""you took one puff at a party, I'm breaking up with you"" kinda of deal breaker, but more of a ""you smoke too much for me"" is very normal. "
So.. which one of your parents scared this shit out of you when you were younger about sex?
"Omg thank you so much for this comment. It resonated hard. I'm lucky that he's supportive and open to talking things out. We talked for four hours today and went from both feeling like, ""is this a dealbreaker??"" to, ""oh wait no it's not a big scary thing it's a totally manageable thing."" I apologized for giving him mixed messages and hurting him by pulling the rug out from under him. And we both agreed to communicate more openly when we're feeling uncomfortable or hurt. By the end, we were smiling and kissing. Honestly, having made it through my twenties with a decent amount of baggage that I'm actively trying to unpack, I'm really excited to be entering my 30s dating someone who's on the same page as me."
"It's totally normal and reasonable to want to get married. However, he doesn't want to marry you. It's been 4 years and he hadn't even considered the possibility. So now you're left with making a choice: do you want to continue the relationship as is or do you want to pursue a different relationship that will lead to marriage?

&amp;#x200B;"
"I really think you guys are way ahead of the curve being able to have this level of open, honest communication just THREE MONTHS IN! I'm excited for you both because that level of vulnerability says a lot of positive things about the future of your relationship. It took my partner and I six years to get there lol. 

And honestly, not only is a totally manageable thing, it can help stimulate a deeper level of intimacy for you two. That's certainly how things have progressed for us since we started having conversations on these issues. So many couples have to tiptoe around discussions on sexual issues, and here you are sharing your fears and concerns and pains so openly with each other. That is beautiful. I'm so happy for you OP. Best wishes to you both."
End it and send us an update about how poorly she takes it because she took you for granted. 
"If your boyfriend is fully supportive of you and completely on your side, have him come with you to contact the police, university, etc. I have anxiety and when I have had to confront something, my anxiety would get in the way and ruin my thoughts and keep me from articulating clearly what is going on. Bring a piece of paper with all points you want to make so you don't forget any."
"I agree with most of your comment, but I have a problem with one part of it.

Telling him that it is a deal breaker for him to agree to having kids in the future *right now in this moment* is at best destructive and at worst manipulative. You can't force someone to know all of the answers about their future life at age 23. It's just not realistic."
"Understandable; you’re newly moved in together and presumably trying to get on the same routine after having a different one for so long. It’ll always be a shock to the system to have someone new to sleep...around! Plus, of all the different types of compatibility required between two humans in a relationship it’d be very rare to have them all, especially this largely unconscious one! I agree with the people who suggest you make your spare room nice and don’t stress about it. Sleep is essential to us all (never mind being essential in a relationship) and surely you guys will have a much better waking relationship if you’re well rested for the portion of it when you don’t have to interact with each other! Talk to him about this and explain your frustrations - I’m sure he’s already noticed - and suggest this as a solution. Good luck!"
"OP is actually the ex gf, not the current gf. She sometimes posts pretending to be current gf hoping she gets answers she'd prefer to hear instead people asking her why she cares about her ex so much. 

I agree though, she needs to see a mental health professional either way. "
I know he will just continue these strange chats behind my back and I need to just end this. I don’t know why I’m holding on to this relationship. 
"You're looking way too in depth for what to get out of a 1st date imo.  If you don't like the topic of conversation, then you need to take over the conversation some and be the one driving it to topics you want to talk about.  Don't be passive in the discussion."
"That's definitely the best course of action, but from what we've been told, she isn't strong enough to do so since she is thinking about changing job. 

Would you stay on the lines if people like that would induce distress in your significant other? I know I wouldn't, no matter the age of my SO. In fact, there are people who lives all of their life without being self-confident enough to demand of others to respect their limits. The inappropriate behavior comes from the coworker, the couple in question shouldn't have to suffer any negative impact about it. It's just unfair. "
"To be fair, there isn’t a whole lot of evidence here that her BF is immature. He might be shitty and ignoring the boundaries that she set, but that doesn’t make him immature. 

OP, on the other hand, is so aggressively immature that she should probably not be in a relationship for several years. I would expect to see this behavior from someone who was 14, not a 19 year old. "
"You're a shitty friend. Who constantly flirts with their best mate's girlfriend?

Who needs enemies with friends like these..."
"Echoing all the sentiments to bring all documentation to every level of appropriate authority (university officials, Title IX, police).

Adding to please ONLY travel with friends/bf/family/university security escorts until he has been dealt with properly and is gone from the area for good.

I’m seriously worried he’s going to escalate once he realizes you’re not bending to his will. 

DO NOT MEET WITH HIM. Do NOT explain yourself. He does not deserve anything from you, not a reply, not anything. No matter what you say he will twist it and use it to manipulate and guilt you. 

He’s a predator. "
"Are you sure they broke up for good last year? Are you sure they actually broke up at all? It could have been a heated argument. 

He goes to visit her biweekly, so is not like you would have run into her, noticed a change in his behavior, etc. For all you know, you are the other woman. "
"This is random and may not be for you but me and my girl are in similar situations and we started doing those intricate paint by numbers kits. It gives us something to do for a few hours in between life stuff. Each one takes us a few months and we have a growing wall of art we made with each other.

The biggest benefit was the sense of quality time we gained having a consistent activity. It wasn't the idea but just kinda happened. We mostly talk and drink wine while painting and now the good convos, belly laugh moments, etc are what I see when I look at the completed ones.

We also just bought ourselves some longboards (at 30+ y/o) and have been having a ball finding all these bike paths/trails we never knew existed.

Um... call the cops and dont post it on reddit ? 
"&gt;This morning, we were talking and I asked her if she's talked to him at all recently.

Don't ask questions you don't really want to know the answers to. If hearing about him makes you feel insecure, then don't discuss him. Don't bring him up, and ask her to do the same.

&gt;I asked her why she hid that information from me and she blew up at me, saying that her miscarriage is none of my business (I agreed) but I still felt like I deserve to know if something like that comes up. 

Was it a relevant conversation? Do you really think she should inform you every time she receives any communication from her ex? It's one thing if he was talking shit about your relationship, going over the top to try to win her back, or if she was upset by the conversation. But if that's not the case...why is it a problem?"
Do you just hate doing anything with your gf or

"&gt; I would like to keep her as a friend. 

You are a 26 year old woman being manipulated by a teenager. She is not your friend. Have some self respect. "
I mean you have described it very well. People are often afraid to open up until you know them better for fear you will reject them. Very few people lay all cards on the table straight away out of that fear of shame/rejection/embarrassment.
You went to networking events. So what? Any employer should be happy for someone to be broadening their knowledge and contacts in the industry. Just post in the app you're not looking to leave your current job and she must be mistaken. Lie and then leave. 
"When used correctly the pill has more than 99% effectiveness and the condom 98%.

For both to fail would be less than a 0.0002% chance. So either she’s very unlucky or wasn’t using these methods correctly.

The chance of this also happening to you if you’re using both of these methods properly is incredibly unlikely."
9 months seems like a long time at your age but it really isn’t shit. This relationship wasn’t good to begin with and the fact that it already deteriorated in the timeframe is baaaaaad sign. Move on.
"Whoa, this has just blown my mind, I only read the titles - that’s some dark shit. This girl is troubled. "
"Is your husband a little stupid? 

Because if he's at all smart - he knows that his ex won't want him to use that name. And he knows that if you knew the origin of the name, you won't want him to use it either. He knows that what he is doing is wrong, and yet he lies anyway so he can get what he wants. What he wants is more important than your feelings. 

I really don't think he's that naive. He knows. He doesn't care. 

Why are you trying to have children with someone you can't trust and who doesn't care about your feelings? "
"We both agree that the reason why it deteriorated is that I am not there for most of the time. When I am there, everything goes back to the way it was. We do try to find ways to change things when I'm not around, but we have a very hard time as neither of us have been in an LDR before"
I'm guessing it caused a problem for you? 
"Make a decision for yourself, don't let either side influence your decision. If A sounded more fun choose A, if B choose B.

"Ask her about it and then hire a makeup artist who can do hairstyling. Keep in mind that a freelance mua in my area is about $150-200 for 2-3 hours. The whole process with hair, and explaining how to apply will probably be about 4 hours.


But it's the best way imo:

- it's a low stress way for her to learn, the mua can do it in your home, and there's no pressure on your gf to figure out how to learn

-mua can explain how to do these things and suggest products for your gf's skill level and skin type(without a pressure to buy)

-your gf won't spend money on bad products or products she can't/doesn't know how to use

-she shouldn't be disappointed with the outcome, and might find she actually likes it

That said,

You've only dated 5 months. Like others said, don't push the issue, and be careful with your phrasing."
"It was in an attempt to open up to him and be honest about what I've been struggling with, how I have trouble trusting people because I'm afraid that they may deceive me like my ex did. But because I got so upset and anxious it came out like I accused him of being like my ex, which was absolutely never ever my intention. I know he isn't like him at all, and that's what makes it even worse. I hurt him, and that's the last thing I ever wanted to do.   


I think maybe worse than that is that I didn't realize until the next day how badly I had hurt him, we had a falling out a little that same evening, but it got worse the day after. Maybe if I had known, it would have had ""festered"" less? There's only so much you can do by explaining afterwards, if there's already been done damage :( "
"My maternal grandmother didn't marry until she was 24, almost 25. She was considered an 'old maid' LOL

Different times, your gran and mom have a different mindset because times were different in their youths. 28 is hardly old and its weird to me they think there is no chance. It's not like you declared you'll never marry or anything. I could see if you were 38 them thinking you'd made a life decision but at 28, hardly. So just take the mixer with cheer and if/when you do marry you can all joke about it and they'll get you something else. If you don't marry big deal, you still got a mixer."
"I'm highlighting the fact that within the context of a lifelong relationship, a previously aborted baby can become a real weight on one's conscience. This is precisely because it can feel like a death. The language used made perfect sense."
You are right.  It is an emotional affair but he doesn’t see it because he has been chatting with this woman for a couple of years. It won’t stop and that is depressing.

"They're right, she is really young for you. You'll get comments like that a lot. If you two want this to work out, you'll have to learn to ignore them. So if it's not impacting your ability to work, then you should both be ignoring the comments and moving on.  "
"My boyfriend and I do this often. He’s a very light sleeper and I freaked when he first mentioned it. I thought about it though, and a few days later I casually mentioned it and said we could try it. He was so happy that I was open to it. It’s been great for us. He’s more well rested, has more energy, and is just better to be around. I love a happy boyfriend. Intimacy hasn’t suffered, although we do miss our bedtime snuggle as we fall asleep. So we oftentimes still do that and then one of us sneaks off to the couch for the rest of the night. Try it!"
What ever she is doing she will in time be with someone else that will be really fuckin painful to see.  You are your first priority go no contact at least for a while and try and heal and work on yourself. Good luck mate.
"Apologies, I have edited the post to be more clear on that part"
"I met my husband, who was essentially my first SO, at the ripe old age of 34. My family felt the same as yours I think. When we got married, the majority of my friends were either leaving long term relationships or getting divorces. I had essentially been lapped. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was single, I was always anxious to be in a relationship. But looking back, I would not have done it any other way. I traveled. i started a thriving company. I learned important things and had amazing experiences. Before, I was SO NOT READY. And there's nothing wrong with that. While you can do these things with a partner, its more complicated. You can be selfish when you are single. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I say...GET THE DAMN MIXER. Live life at your pace and don't wait around for anyone. Get out of your comfort zone, if a relationship is what you want. Push yourself. But don't stay home every night waiting for life to start. It has already started. The question is whether or not you are living it the way you want. And don't let anyone tell you you are not complete without a partner. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"Can anyone confirm that calling the police would actually do anything in this situation? Not to be a jerk, but I honestly rarely hear about police giving a crap about situations like this. At most they'll say is he hasn't actually done anything and gaslight OP's feelings and experiences.

I wouldn't respond to this old man and I would inform security at your job that he's a creep who's been following you and to let you know if he comes around trying to find you again. I'd also invest in pepper spray and some self defense classes."
"She sounds immature and selfish. But shes 25 right? Many people are at that age. Maybe, sit down talk to her like let her know this is serious and if things dont change quickly you plan on ending the relationship. Then give it 4 months and re-evaluate. Sometimes I say stupid shit like ""man I would love to have a car that works more than 4 months of the year"".  I'm just saying maybe let her know how you feel, give her a chance and go from there. "
"Maybe you do get married some day. I’v heard lots of stories about people getting married after 10 years. You’ve been together for 4 years and maybe he wants to marry you but he wants to wait a little longer to ask you.  But I understand if you always had the picture of marriage in you head its hard to get it out too. And for some reasons marriage is also a save option for legalthings. Try to focus on other things and try to let go of the whole marriage idea in your head, atleast for now.  
Hahaha a tumbledryer! Aah well  it’s the little things ;)

"You are performing a lot of mental gymnastics to justify him disrespecting you and your boundaries.  That is very unhealthy.  

You don't think his actions are not normal and are offensive, and you've expressed this to him verbally and clearly (I assume.)  He decided consciously to ignore your opinion and feelings and continue the behavior anyway.  

He's not ignorant - he's self-centered and disrespectful.  And he's got you brainwashed."

"Your husband is a dink.

Let's just assume he's a lovable goob, and he just loves the name. 

As far as naming etiquette goes, he kinda just stole his exes name...Especially if it's unique. 

Like, can you imagine him running into his ex down the line, and they both have little girls names Addie-May?

But I mean, there's a larger story about this ""he's lying about talking to his ex, but he was really telling the truth"" stuff. Somethings not Addie-ING up. "
[removed]
"Don't play games in a relationship, don't seek revenge, talk to him when things bother you (and don't drag others into your relationship problems by flirting with them when you are not available, that's inconsiderate)

You asked him to stop talking to his ex, and he agreed, but then he continued to do it, so the conversation has now changed.  You need to talk to him again, but now the discussion is why he is disrespecting the agreement you two made by continuing to talk to her?

I don't know if you request was unreasonable, to stop talking completely, but I can appreciate not wanting them to be so close, to know he's moved on and is focusing on the relationship with you.  But if he can't respect the agreements you two are making, then this doesn't sound like a relationship to stay in.

"It will likely be a deal breaker, but you also need to look after your mental health. If you're already using BC+condoms and still feel this way, it's an issue you will need to work through with your therapist. "
"I think you're right, I don't want to enable her or be a helicopter friend telling her what to do, maybe it is time to just let her be even if she is making sketchy choices. "
"I don't really see a lot of positive things about him in your post. I don't think you're that enthusiastic and honestly, if you feel iffy at this stage it's not going to get any better. Just let him down gently this time to avoid awkwardness at work as much as you can, cite the age gap as a reason and then break all contact."
I mean I’m hyped for you and he sounds like a great guy! But was there a question here or did I just miss it 
"Thanks. It is emotionally abusive, because of everything else he’s done. It helps to hear someone else say it. "
"Ugh. He sounds like one of those disgusting ""nice guys"" that isn't. He has only been your friend as a way to get to be your boyfriend, it's a means to an end. He's manipulative and controlling. He's patiently planted himself into your life as a good, reliable ""friend,"" so he would be hard to lose, and is now essentially trying to manipulate you into dating him because ""it makes sense."" Don't fall for his tricks, OP!"
"Hey OP, I'm in a similar boat. I'm four years younger than you, but people are starting to catch on to my...perpetual single-ness. My grandma doesn't ask often, but has asked before if I'm dating anyone. My mom never asks, thank god. I feel a lot of shame from it, especially the older I get. I have a friend I've never openly talked to about it before (and wouldn't dare want to), but when she was high one time she mentioned that I've never had a boyfriend and my heart just sank. I even have a newer friend who doesn't know about it, and I was so embarrassed to admit it that I just straight up lied about having had a past boyfriend (threw an old crush under the bus, I know we never actually dated sorry man). 

If I could offer any advice, OP, is to at least feel okay with yourself. I love myself and I believe myself to be worthy of love, but my fear of intimacy is pretty intense. Honestly, it sucks but I would back off talking to your grandma as much. She's just nagging you and is frankly being pretty rude. Your relationship status is your business and nobody else's. Anyone who has a problem with it needs to get their priorities straightened out. They should love you for you, and openly pointing out an insecurity of yours like that is incredibly rude. Someone who truly loves and cares about you wouldn't being making such a spectacle of your situation. Stand up for yourself OP, you owe that to yourself. "
Really? I got the impression that it was about how leaving dishes by the sink *and digging his heels in about it* was disrespectful of his wife's feelings and slowly murdered her love for him.
"Here's the thing luv, you don't owe this guy JACK SHIT. You can just text him and leave him to sort out his own emotional baggage! "

You’re better off out of this mess. I wish you the best of luck from now on."
Yes. Tracking. Sorry fir not elaborating.

You’re 28......not 60. Be single and enjoy your life. When it happens it happens. And you’ll be happier and have a way more healthy relationship. 
Does anyone here remember that post from that girl with the gamer BF? She made her BF write down the most important things in his life (in order) and then write down the things he spends his time on (in order)? He realized that he listed her as his most important thing but then she was listed as what he spent the least amount of time on?
And in this week's edition of NiceGuys (TM)....
A song of Ice and Fire. 
You’re only crazy if you continue to put up with this bullshit. You need to end this relationship. 
"""Teach,  I am not interested in having a relationship with you of ANY kind. Do NOT contact me again either via phone, email or a 3rd party.""

Then BLOCK. BLOCK. BLOCK. Lock down social media (if he has it). He will probably get through some how (new email address, a friends phone, etc. DO NOT RESPOND.  IGNORE EVERYTHING. Though if its particularly scary or nasty save a copy and go file a police report."

Welcome to the karma farm y'all!
"It's a joke about people putting up with unending bullshit from a partner because they're very good looking, so they don't want to dump them."
"Damn sorry to say this but as someone who's done all this exact same shit, It was definitely boredom or diminishing interest. Everyone knows tinder is for hooking up, don't be blind!

If anything ask him how he would feel if you were doing this shit to him? See the reaction and go from there. But seems to be not worthwhile anyway. Good luck! "
"Just imagine if you did name a baby Addie Mae and how his ex would react when she found out. That was HER baby name and now her ex stole it? She would be well within her rights to go absolutely nuclear, and he should realize that. Dude has *problems*. "
"Your GF is the worst, and her consistent ""can you imagine how much happier we'd be with a ____________"" is the least bad thing about her. Here is what I need to know:

1) She doesn't just ignore your plans and your family traditions, she manipulates you out of doing them. 
2) She brought an animal you were allergic to into your home, without talking to you about it, and wants to do it again. 

These things are not OK, they are not respectful, or healthy. Run! There is no opposite perspective here.  "
"&gt;really -really- romantic and like, the ultimate gesture of love and stuff.

This is like a super immature and dumb reason to want to get married."
"I think you should reframe this as “I made a rule for myself that I don’t date people who smoke.” That is a perfectly acceptable dealbreaker. If you want to date a girl who smokes/might smoke, then you’ll have to either decide to stick to your rule and refrain from the relationship or adjust your “rule” before you enter into the relationship. What you can’t do is either (1) unilaterally impose a new rule on a girlfriend who didn’t realize you were anti-smoking (2) knowingly date a smoker with hopes of changing them. "
"Girl! He's still with his ex.

Text her and let her know her boyfriend is a cheating knob. Attach some proof if you want! "
"But that's my issue, I have no clue how to change that "
"&gt; in case he is innocent 

&amp;#x200B;

Best case he's lying by omission, worst case he just never broke up with her. It hasn't even been a year, find somebody that won't take your trust for granted.

&amp;#x200B;"
Thank you! :)

"I'm sorry for your situation. It makes me sad to know that your SO is facing some sort of distress at work because people aren't minding their business, despite you guys being professional about it. 

That being said, I know that I wouldn't tolerate people going up to her and patronizing her with their 2 cents' moral. It's something if people would try to interfere in someone's life who could handle it and brush it away, but since it creates some sort of distress to your GF and granted that they are crossing her limits and feel powerless about it, I would come up with a solution for these inappropriate interventions to stop.

Being careful to not create a workplace drama myself, I would go to the most vocal people who are at the origin of the situation and would tell them that if they have things to say about my personnal life, to come and tell it directly straight to me, instead of her. I would inform them that it is none of their business and that they are inducing anxiety in her and creating distress to her. I would add that if they do not start respecting her personal decisions and private life, that there will be serious consequences. 

If your GF trusts you and accept you to handle the situation of course..  my 2 cents.

Good luck friend."
+1 avoid all contact. It sounds like he uses any situation possible to emotionally manipulate or garner undue sympathy.
"I've been dating my girlfriend for 5 years and here is my take on this.

First off I think it's my responsibility to make her friends happy, and to make her look good in front of them.  You should be good to the ppl who are good to your SO.

Secondly the biggest thing I see why relationships don't work out is just straight up bad communication because people are afraid.  My GF and I tell each other everything what we should work on, what we find attractive.  If she told me she was afraid I would fall for her best friend I would just takes steps to figure out why this is a problem and how to make you feel better about it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not you vs him, it's you and him vs the problem just remember that for all problems in life down the road."
"So, to answer your question directly. Yes, you are leading him on. He declared his deep romantic interest for you, so even if he claims to be ok with being friends, he won't be able to in the short term. The truth is, hanging out with him as friends after he shared his romantic interest with you isn't fair to either of you. You have to give this guy space, mentally and physically. Also, it seems like most people on here are angry at your friend and think that you should end your friendship with him. I feel like most of those folks would hate what I am saying, but ultimately, isn't it the same advice?

&amp;#x200B;

It really is for both of your benefit though. He probably won't be able to move on from his romantic feelings until he moves on from your platonic, more than a friendship, but not quite romantic relationship. If and when he moves on, you will be able to be friends again. "
Looks are a depreciating asset. 
"Can you imagine how much happier you'd be with a new girlfriend?     



"
"Dated a guy like this for 6 years. I did like to play games together, but I also wanted to be able to do other stuff too. He would join me only if I begged and pleaded and would hardly engage at all when we were out. 

I left him when I was 22 and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. He begged me to stay and said he would get help and that he wanted to change, but 4+ years later he's doing the same things. "
"Expectations run both ways. It's reasonable to expect your partner to value your companionship, intelligence, personality, and support more than they value your physique. It's reasonable to expect your partner to be willing to have open conversations with you about life priorities like moving towns to follow education/career/other goals. It's reasonable to leave someone who doesn't meet those expectations."
"This is real talk. I got mine from a store liquidation for 80% off, I never thought I would own one, it's my most treasured thing after my phone. It's a life-changer for cooking."
"I feel like the kitchenaid is more of a ""she shouldn't have to wait because I know shell get a lot of use out of it and she already asked for one"" than a ""well shes never getting married so I might as well give it to her"" gift. Get the kitchenaid. She will find a nicer wedding gift if you already have one, and it might get karma rolling in your direction. ;) 

Grandma needs to be told that her constant questioning is upsetting and that you will tell her when you are seeing someone.  "
"I appreciate the input. Just to clear it up, my reactions in no way have anything to do with him lying. I'm not one to lose my shit. When he lies, yes, I get upset. I may cry or have a harsher tone, but I was in a very abusive relationship before him so being verbally abusive is never okay in my book. When he tells the truth, even if it's something that makes me not happy, then we talk about it. I may ask questions, I may explain my feelings, but I don't scream, name call, etc. He is always afraid of a reaction that I have never given to him which has always been something I just don't understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, going through his stuff is wrong. I'll be reaching out to a therapist for both of us. I see one individually, so I'll be bringing up that I need help with how to rebuild my level of trust with him, or when to call it on this relationship. I don't believe we are at that point despite our issues. But the lying and my snooping are not signs that we have our shit together by any means."
Dude she let you sleep in the car and still said cat sitting “wasn’t that bad”. That alone is breakup worthy. I have a feeling that she would be okay with just about any man as long as he fills the role she has set out for him in her life. You deserve more than that. Please dump her and live your life!
"So did you both smoke and both agreed not to? Or did she smoke and you're hedging with the ""neither of us will smoke"" wording?"
"Call the police non-emergency line. I have anxiety, too, and this call would be hard for me to make. But think of it as a chance to get advice and be proactive. The police are there to help.
""Hi, I am OP. I have received unwanted contact from a man. I find him threatening. He taught me in high school and really made me feel uncomfortable. Now he is at my college. What advice do you have for me?"""
"Ehmm... OP there's a real chance he's planning a school shooting / bombing.

Please contact the police with that email, or make an anonymous tip if you're uncomfortable involving them.

Of course, there's a real chance I'm being paranoid, but he's trying to settle unfinished business after six years, talks about ""retiring"" and makes vague threats how the school will be sorry - whatever is going on in his head, it's not good."

Just break up with him.
"Have either of you ever lived with a partner before? It could be a steep learning curve, esp so for her. Have you spoken up? She could be assuming everything’s fine. Don’t bottle it up till it explodes, if you’re equal partners you deserve equal respect."
"Your husband may also benefit from individual therapy. Apparently people who have grown up in emotionally unstable environments can lie by routine as they are used to having to try to avoid extreme volatile reactions. There may be some baggage here your husband needs to work through, so that he has the tools to face tough situations and ""get in trouble"". "
"When you know you have been a bad boy this mean you can change it , it will be hard , probably harder than what u expect . but the fact is u can move on , u both can. just let her know that u feel bad for what u have been in the past , go to a therapist , and try to make yourself a better man .  
i have read a lot of comments that they think u have to get out of that relationship but i deeply do not think so.  


ps : sry for my bad Eng ."
"As Dan Savage would say, ""this isn't a relationship, it's a hostage situation."""
All I can say is that she definitely isn’t thinking of you as her partner. She should respect your NHL plans and shouldn’t have bought those concert tickets-especially with you finding out on twitter. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of respect or communication coming from her end either. 
He has already called me jealous and that I’m imagining things. He says this is harmless and he’s not doing anything wrong. Why can’t he see how weird it is????
"Definitely don't invest more in him than he invests in you. His hobbies and town are more important to him than you are, so make sure your hobbies and town are more important to you than he is. 

If you want to do things that aren't fun for him, go do them without him. If you want to live in a different part of the country, go do that without him. If you're having fun with him right now you don't have to break up, but don't make him a priority in your life. You aren't one in his."
"I only know your side of the story but from what I've read.  I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years, and I wouldn't do anything to hurt her or make her feel bad on purpose.

Problems can be solved pretty easily if the intent isn't bad, but in this case it looks like it is.  He's going to manipulate you because he can and he's a douche, if you stay with him you're only enabling him.  If he thinks he can do better than you or that he's settling for you leave him, I promise you, you can be someone's first and they can be yours at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

You seem unconfident in the way you talk, which makes me think you project your lack of confidence in the relationship which is easy to get tired of in a relationship.  Are you here to seek validity from Reddit instead of talking to him?  I do think this problem can be solved but it just comes down to is it worth the effort?  You can't control how you feel only what you do about the situation."
"Well, you'll have to change that, won't you?"
"Get it! I spent so much time just standing there with my little hand mixer, unable to do anything for minutes at a time. Now I can wash a dish or grab ingredients while my mixer is running. "
"Ehmmm if you read my post then you would have read that she does not have that insecurity with anyone but me so how is it not about me? The explanation someone gave that she wants me to find her attractive and not other people is unlogical to me. Men do not think in this way, we feel more at ease with people we care about than with strangers.... therefore “female logic”. Beside why tf are you so butthurt?? People on Reddit hear one thing about gender and they lose their shit. If you don’t have any useful input do not respond."
Lol wow. These are the games you play? 
"Eh, I mean, I wouldn't think so. 

It sure seems like you're trying very hard to make something out of the more recent set of messages with the guy. People are allowed to have friendships. You trying to round their conversations up to cheating is a big stretch. 

Does she typically get bruises like that during sex with you? Probably not, huh? If they were from sex, why would she be calling your attention to them? Isn't that the opposite of suspicious? So, again, a stretch.

BV is a thing that happens. 

The thing with the password, to me, is a tough one - because you have ah history of going through her messages. A very normal reaction to that is just to change her passwords. Should she have told you that's why she did it if that's why she did it? Probably - but she probably also thought that'd provoke another fight. (And it's certainly a lesser crime than your snooping to begin with). 

I mean, you're literally trying to snoop here, and it's quite likely that she knows you're paranoid and suspicious and is protecting herself, especially if, as she sees it, you get unreasonably jealous about normal friendly conversations. You're not entitled to her passwords and the *first* thing somebody should do if they think they have a snoopy party is to change their passwords. 

(I mean, you read through every message in a three-person chat checking to see if she said anything flirty? You're clearly not thinking very straight there. It's unreasonable to expect she hasn't noticed.)"
"I think my idea of marriage is different, like I never fantasized about marriage so maybe I’n not the one who completely understands what you’re going through., I just dont understand why you want to get married so badly. Fours years is not that long, alot can change in a couple of  years and maybe your boyfriends thoughts about marriage too. I live in the Netherlands and most people around my age aren’t married and don’t even think about it, so maybe that’s a little culture difference. And for everyone who says that you should break up with him, if you like him and love your relationship why would you throw away what you have? "
"The fact that he is following these people from your area is the bigger red flag here. To me that screams intention. If not, why not just follow the other people who live elsewhere? Why is it area specific unless he is looking for something? Be wary of this.

Other than that, your boyfriend definitely likes penis. Maybe not just penis, but he most certainly has a fetish for transgenders/shemales/etc. 

The lying, albeit it most likely coming from fear of judgement, isn’t cool either. Screenshot the dating account, the people he is following, and any other thing that proves his fetishized and ask or confront him about. I’d be more concerned about him seeking something out as his actions look that way and you can’t give him something he wants. "
"you guys need to sit down and calmly discuss boundries and what each of you consider ok as far as what works for both of you in a relationship. important to remember that men and women who find each other attractive CANNOT be just friends, sucks but one of the 2 is going to be reading signs from the other before too long that they find them romantically comparable. you dont like him communicating with his ex on Facebook or whatever that's a reasonable boundary, he doesnt want to going to another guys place to watch a movie extremely understandable (and frankly not a proportional response, this is much heavier than what he has done). but at no point should either of you be using a third party to emotionally blackmail the other. have a talk and get on the same page if you cant then bo harm no foul, he can go his way and you can go watch that movie without any guilt. good luck"
"So in reality, what is it that you want? You've mentioned that you want her to perceive that  what she did was wrong. Why? What good would come of it? So that she could feel guilty about her decisions? You mention you want her to recognize that she was a victim? Why? So that she can feel the pain that accompanies that acknowledgement? So you can help her get over this pain? This is an incredibly selfish way to approach a partner's past. Whatever she may have done in her past or whatever may have happened to her, she has clearly come to terms with it. If you don't stop trying to dredge up her past and ""help her"" only one of two things will happen- either she will get sick of it and leave you and you will not be able to contain your resentment and leave her. Either find a way to come to terms with her past, or acknowledge that you can't and leave her."
How is he pressing on her.. he litteraly made a reddit post to ask how he can approach the subject.. smh
Took the pill everyday with lunch like clock work and it’s been 8 years and even when wine drunk she still says she used a condom. It’s one in a million but it still can happen. No contraceptive is 100%
"I get that we don't go into fetishes, kinks, or anything deep and dark on a first date, but I feel like by the 3-4th date, I should be able to say if I have BASIC compatibility with someone."
"Maybe. :/ We both said that we weren't seeing other people, but I'm going to talk with him about it on Friday to see what's going on and where we're both heading. I'd just rather have some closure and move on than be slowly dropped "
"It's not up to you to try to get back together. She was the one that broke up, not you. You're just in the typical stage of denial where you don't want to accept that you two are done. "
"You need to talk to him asap. Try to talk it out if you want things to work, because it CAN work. Me and my fiance are kinda the same. Me, low libido. Him, high libido. It almost ruined our relationship. Thankfully I have a very understanding fiance who didn't get offended when I told him he was too pushy when it came to sex, that I felt like sex was a chore instead of something to look forward to. Now we're not a 10/10 perfect relationship, but he respects my boundaries now (most of the time) and I don't put everything else before sex like I used to. Sex is definitely more random and enjoyable after talking our differences out. I hope the same for you two. "

"I’ve been there! Don’t let anyone tell you how you feel is invalid - it’s not.

Personally, I got an IUD, insisted on using condoms everytime, and refrained from sex during “high risk” days of my cycle.

The IUD didn’t end up working out for me, so we use vasectomy + condoms + being aware of cycles.

But that’s up to you. If even multiple bc options aren’t enough to calm your anxieties - just don’t have sex. Stick with oral or whatever else you like.
And don’t let anyone try to convince you you’re wrong, Esspecially your partner."
Yep. My sister got pregnant on the pill and using condoms and it scared the absolute crap out of me
So.... is your point that she should just play games and be happy with it? How is that less sexist?
"Maybe :/ I'd just rather know what's going on than be left in the dark. I don't regret having sex with him so early, but I'd rather be told he's not interested in anything more than slowly faded away.

But I messaged him on facebook asking what was up and he replied saying sorry and that he was still up to meet on Friday. So I'm going to talk to him then and see how he feels. "
"have you told your girlfriend about this? i know how hard it can be to open up, especially about something like abuse, but i think you should probably talk to her about this.   


getting over abuse is very hard and takes a lot of time. if you can afford therapy, i would recommend it. but if you can't, talk to a trusted friend or family member. journal, make vlogs to yourself, whatever helps you process and work through your emotions. there's a lot of resources about this stuff online, you can probably find something that helps you. best of luck!"

stay gone. Seriously.

He sees you as a prop, an accessory in his life that should behave and react the way HE wants. He does not see you as your own person, with your own thoughts, personality, or desires. 

Anyone who tells you more than once that they’re disappointed in your reaction and would rather you act differently than your true self doesn’t actually like you. They want you to be who they think you should be.

"I agree with all of this. The fact that so many people think talking about the same name with numerous serious partners in your life is a capital offense is just...so odd to me.

I guarantee a high percentage of us have kids with names originally proposed by our SO’s high school girlfriends/boyfriends. Shall we dump them all for ‘lying by omission’ at not revealing that this name was not the *specialest* most *uniquest* name and representative of our *entire special and unique bond* to one another? 

I can’t imagine being approached about this. I think I’d either be very confused or die laughing. "
"If I were you I’d hold off on baby names and even the thought of creating a family with someone who obviously has a hard time telling the truth. If he so freely lies about things now, and for this long.. I can only imagine what else he may try to cover up in the future. 

Second. Obviously there’s zero trust if you guys have to snoop through each other’s phones and accounts. This isn’t a healthy relationship. I’m sure if things were different and you didn’t feel like he was lying to you every other day, you wouldn’t feel the need to snoop. I’m sure you could care less if he snoops through your things, you’re just allowing it or ok with it because you’ve made the agreement with him that either of you should have access to each other’s phones and accounts. It shouldn’t have to be that way.. especially if trust isn’t an issue. 

Trust me I’m speaking from experience here. I was in a relationship and I could care less if she was looking through my shit, I had nothing to hide.. at some point I didn’t feel the need to look at her stuff either. Things change when people are dishonest and you’re constantly trying to figure out if that person is lying to you. It isn’t healthy. "

"That’s how I honestly felt as well, but he would turn it around and make me feel unappreciative.  I think all these years he’s been wanting praise for doing kind gestures that are deemed normal.  For example if he made a reservation at a restaurant for my birthday, he would focus more on how he did such a great job and wanting me to give him excessive amounts of praise.  Then he’d boast to all his friends how he had taken me.  I feel like it was seriously just a competition of “how can I make myself appear to being an awesome boyfriend to others and on social media” vs. actually being an awesome boyfriend irl.  If that makes any sense."
"Does your girlfriend have any friends in her department? It probably wouldn't help for her to confront this woman, but having one or two friends willing to subtly shame people who bring it up could help tamp down on the office gossip. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the reason it seems so 'juicy' isn't just the age, it's that you guys were trying to hide it. Hidden office romance. That all gets so much more boring once it's just a regular relationship. Which it will be for everyone in a month if you guys just put your heads down and ignore the jerk.

"Right, but the question i ls whether their relationship is sustainable given her preference for black men"
"He wasn't talking to the ex, she said he looked and he hasn't contacted her. This was from an old message the wife found when snooping."
I went through something like this in high school and did not tell an adult. I ended up getting hurt. Please block these people and tell a trustworthy adult. 
"The car has both electronic locking and a physical key unfortunately, and I need to pick it up tomorrow. But this is a good suggestion, although he does not have my new address and won't be getting it."
There's no denying that OP is in a sticky situation. In my case I wouldn't hesitate to tell my mom but I do know that every family's dynamic is different and everyone has a unique moral compass. OP has a lot of thinking to do (and my advice for their particular situation would be to give the father a deadline to come clean).
"I can understand your frustration, but I'm one of those too. Mostly because my parents would legitimately be devastated. I doubt they even know you all are sleeping together. It's irrational, but sometimes people do things to protect their parents- my mom's reaction to my brother cohabiting was hard to watch, even though she eventually just accepted it. But she was legitimately heartbroken. You don't have to accept it as the right thing to do, but if he's hard lined about it, he won't change his mind. And then it comes to whether you can deal with it- perfectly reasonable if you can't. But it might be a point of incompatibly"
"&gt; **I draw the line at communication with the source of the porn** 

Yes and yes again. Going on a pornsite and browsing is so much different than asking for nudes from real life people and, OP, it is 100% acceptable for you to be upset with this. I would probably be fuming. Also, if he shows that he thinks nothing is wrong with it, and expresses that he will do it again despite it making you feel this way, it is 100% acceptable for this to be a deal breaker. Hell, it's okay if it's a deal breaking without a conversation. 

*You* and *you alone* get to decide how you feel about this and what it means to you."
"Yeah, this guy sounded like a problem just in OP's description of him. No commitment, on/off with the ex for 5 years, AND he describes her as abusive. If she's so horrible, why's he having an affair with her?

I'm suspicious of people who slag their ex. It's such a cheater thing to do."

"Married, been together for a total of seven years.  We get into a rut sometimes, he is definitely a homebody, but when work isn't hectic he's totally fine with hanging out with friends.  Often he'll get me coffee on his way home, I get his favourite energy drinks.  I hang out with my friend on Monday nights, once his schedule is normal again we're talking about joining a trpg together. We love going to the park with the dog on his days off and at least once a month we'll go out for dinner, usually at his prompting.  Daily, we watch late night and the news together and while we play different video games we often watch each other.

Sounds like your boyfriend takes you for granted.  You'll always put up with him, so why change? "
Let us know what the finish like looks like. 
"I'm not sure this post is real, but if it is:

Please tell an adult you trust everything about this person. He sounds dangerous.

This is a serious situation and no one should have to go through something like this alone. It may even be serious enough to talk to the police--which is why it would be a really good idea to talk about all this with an adult. "
"He knows perfectly well who came up with that name. Maybe he just really likes the name, maybe he wants to steal it to spite her or maybe his heart won't let her go. No matter the reason, it is not right for him to come to you with this name and want to give it to your child. 
If he just really likes the name, fine, you can name your dog Addie Mae.

If he wants to spite her or he still has love for her (which is also the only reason to want to spite her by stealing the name) then he should not be having a baby with you right now. He has unresolved issues and can't even give you his whole heart. That is not a good time to have a baby.

If I were you, I would honestly be devastated. He has chosen to hold onto this name from his past relationship instead of making a new future plan with you.

What is his game plan anyway? What would happen if you already had a baby girl and named her Addie Mae and then run into her by some off chance? What kind of help would there be to pay when she has a daughter with the same name or better yet, starts crying about that being her name for her future daughter. 


This whole thing is weird and very shady of him. He can't possibly have thought this through. It is a sick move on his part but not a relationship breaker. We all have baggage, but this one is a bit of a deception on his part. 

Tell him you don't care for this name any more. If he asks why, tell him. I am sure he will change his tone real fast. If it keeps bothering you, see a counselor alone, as a couple or both. It is just so wrong for him to want to give your daughter a name his ex came up with. A name is for life. For the rest of your life, you would have a daughter with a name his ex came up with and loved, even if you got divorced 10 years from now, your daughter would always have been named by his ex. That is fucked up. "
"First and foremost, I encourage you to seek medical attention. Strangulation can be lethal up to 36 hours later. (Keep in mind, I don't know madatory reporting in your area). Secondly, if you feel comfortable, I would encourage you to report to your local law enforcement. He tried to kill you. The likely hood of you dying at the hands of this person jumped 750% when he put his hands around your neck. If you don't want to involve police, do what you can to leave this relationship. None of this is your fault and your safety is most important. Best of luck."
"Look, I hate to say it, but I am not totally sure there is a real compromise here. No one should be forced into having sex that they are uncomfortable having, but here are the questions you need to ask yourself:

1) Do you think therapy would help you overcome this?

2) Are you willing to talk to him, in a time when neither of you are about to have sex, like, over coffee on a date or something, about how you feel and that it is less about HIM but more about fear of pain?

3) What is HE willing to do to make you comfortable.

See if you can get those questions answered but with the realistic fact that if your needs arent being met (less/no sex) and his arent being met either (he wants sex) then there is a basic incompatibility there. It's okay to not want sex but if it is something you'd like or to work on that fear, I'd def seek a therapist."

"Runescape is a highly addicting game. The second you mentioned that, is definitely a problem in itself. Being addicted to that and other mainstream games is a very bad combination. Video game addiction is real and is one of the scariest addictions because it can ruin you. I would seek therapy or treatment for your boyfriend for this addiction. It is very hard to quit on its own. "
So you think the response to his lying issue is to keep things from him also after snooping? I think she should admit what she did
"Ok, so you have your answer. She doesn't like that you're not going to pay all the time. Can you stay with someone who wants you to pay for them all the time? If not, break up with her."
"Would you ever tell your boyfriend that you would like him much better if he acted like someone else?  No, because that's nuts. If you wanted to date a different person, you would break up with him and date a different person.  You don't owe him anything, and you are not obligated to behave in any manner other than that which is natural and healthy for you.  If he isn't interested in being with the real you, it's time to release him back out into the wild.  "
"Yeah, no."
I am addressing my anxiety with a therapist as I stated but I literally cannot have sex in the mean time. I have literal meltdowns and panic attacks that seriously fuck with my body and mind. It’s not so much a “should i stop having sex”. I HAVE to stop till I can figure it all out 
Call the cops. Immediately. 
"I don't think there's enough info here for us to make an accurate assessment.  I think she may have a different version than you do.  If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say you might've friend-zoned her one too many times.  She might've been looking for a different reaction from you the morning after you had sex.  Your friendship may or may not be able to survive this (don't hold your breath).  She might need more of a cooling off period before she talks to you.  She might even be with the other guy at this point."
"I like this one a lot, thanks."
"Or: imagine you had always dreamed of opening a coffee shop called Foam, and you wanted the colour scheme to be brown and green and serve only fair trade coffee, and you told your ex about your dream when you were together and then you broke up and then he and his new wife opened up a coffee shop called Foam with brown and green colour scheme and fair trade coffee.

Aside from the fact the dude seems incapable of having an actual original thought, it also stands to mention that humans aren’t coffee shops and naming your child your ex-girlfriends dream baby name is both unoriginal and downright creepy. "
I just feel bad for stopping without an explanation right after my dad stopped (because she was driving him nuts).
This reminds me of a woman I met while working as a nurse in a pediatric clinic. Woman brought her newborn in for a check up and I go to the waiting room to call them in. I look at the child's name and it is a name of a character from Star Trek. I'm a big trek fan so when I get the woman in the exam room I ask if she is a Star Trek fan. She says no but my husband is. Then asked me why I asked. I said well that name is the same as one of the characters. She goes ballistic. She had no idea her husband suggested they name their kid off a TV show. She had never heard the name before and thought it sounded cool. I wish I were a fly on the wall in that house when she went home. 
She’s 25 and complained to her mom?! 🤦‍♀️
Yo this comment is trash. Wtf.

"Unlike the comment I replied to which suggested that the OP go behind her spouse’s back and secretly give their mutual child a different name than the one they’d chosen together, without his consent?"
"Both myself and my SO have this problem. The lies are never damaging and they always are done to *avoid* some kind of damage, but they happen regardless. For both of us, this weird pattern of white lies does in fact come from being trained by abusive parents to lie in order to avoid being abused. Usually it’s a lie in the moment and is made true later on, like, “Did you talk to soandso about x thing?”  
“Yeah. They said they’ll get back to me later.” *calls them a minute later, resolves lie*  
In a normal family you could just say, “No I forgot. I’ll do it in a minute.” And it’s fine, but in an abusive one, if you say that, you get hurt, sometimes badly, emotionally/mentally or physically, for what should be a simple and easily resolved issue that... really shouldn’t be an *issue* in the first place.  
This is different than being pathological or doing it malevolently or even manipulatively. It doesn’t make it a good thing.  
We’ve gotten much better over the years at just being honest. It takes some de/re-programming is all. "
"This is all you have to worry about?  You agreed to the name, move the fuck on or put the kid up for adoption. "
"Thats my thought also. I think she is actively doing what she originally planned having a secret FWB on the side while acting like a loving devoted wife in the home. I think thats also why she tried to push open marriage before everything happened, during and also after to make herself feel less guilty about her actions. 

I think the only curious thing she has done at this point was admit to the affair. "
Yikes. Don’t try to date in her circle again when she leaves you. The details of how *massively* you failed this test are going to make the rounds of all the girls she knows. 
"Did you not know that a hall pass means one person? You obviously
don’t love her if she went off and hooked up with a bunch of people. You guys are done. "
This should be the top comment. Not all this BS about the name.
This might be the most bulshit answer I've ever read.
"Yep you f***** up, it's over."
"Yeah, 'cause that's the best advice on this whole thread."
lol dude wtf you've dealt with this for a year?? She must be really hot *eye roll*
"lmao, what a doofus bro

Can people really not hold on for 3 months....

You better give her a hall pass."
"How do you know he hasn't forgotten where the name came from? That message was several years old and there had been no meaningful contact related to it since. There's every likelihood that he has forgotten why he likes the name entirely.

That said, you have every right to not want the name any more and should absolutely talk with him about this to figure out if he was actively holding on to the name from a relationship years ago."
Right? I’m pretty sure the reason I am married is because I baked so much!
"Dodge the bullet. 

She is using you."
"You need to find ways to start moving on from your ex such as correctly labeling her as your ex and not your gf. Talk about the relationship in the past tense. Listen to sad music, cry, write bad poetry, talk to whomever you confide in, those sorts of things. "
"This is definitely emotional abuse as he is doing something wrong, making you feel bad, and yet, you feel the need you need to apologize to him, yet you have nothing wrong (in the eyes of a non-abusive human being).

Since it's LDR, it can (not always) be as simple as calling it off, and blocking him (and perhaps anyone associated with him) on all social media."
Shit you’re right. Thanks 
Seriously buy this guy a puppet and tell him that he can't make it do whatever he wants. Don't go back.
"“I forgot my wallet” is a running joke between me and my SO, it’s a funny because it doesn’t matter who pays as long as we’re out doing what we enjoy together."

Thank you about your advice, lots of useful points


I don't know about messaging his ex, what good it will bring to me? I will just prolong my misery, no matter her answer.

He will not come back. He thinks he is at right here and I am at fault. Even if he does fuck that shit and fuck him I would rather eat gravel as a new hobby"

"I'll give another perspective. I would ask her if this is something that an old ex did. You might be getting the emotional weight from an old boyfriend that might of used her for meals and such. 

I would ask more questions"
Thank you. I keep trying to remind myself she may view it differently. 
You are not ready to have a child if you are letting this petty crap get you all riled up. Please just take a breather and put some thought into your choices.
"1) Okay for future reference if you are using false names (which you always should) make sure the people have different letters to start their names? The Angela Ashley is freaking killing me.

2) God, teenagers are so horny.  The fact that you know so many explicit details is irksome.

3) I am super confused, has Angela met this dude or not? Has Ashley met him IRL?

4) Someone being sexually charged doesn't make him a rapist so cut that shit out.

5) Your girlfriend needs to stay in her lane regarding the ""running their plans"" shit.

6) He DOES sound manipulative, but why are you and your gf SO involved?

7) Go to prom and enjoy yourselves. Have Ashley go stag, I'm sure she'll have a good time rather than going with this person?

&amp;#x200B;"
I feel that this is important to mention in your post because that reframes the issue a lot. 
You need to be happy.  She has proven you can't trust her and her not working is not your concern.  Letting her hold on to you for financial security is your concern.  She isn't respecting you.
"That's a good idea. They both are really chill with this one teacher, so I don't they will be so apprehensive if I suggested they go to him. Thank you!"
"Your fiancé allowed you to have some extramarital fun with some clear boundaries in place. You escalated that privilege and continued communicated with this guy behind your fiancé's back for months. You choose to hide this from him because you knew he'd be uncomfortable with this and want it to end. You committed a selfish act, that you claim to not regret.

And you have the audacity to question him doubting your relationship and plans to marry? You had an affair to the point where you developed feelings for this man, something to this day you claim to not regret. Yet you somehow don't understand how your in the wrong?

You don't sound capable of being honest, but if your telling the truth about loving your fiancé I suggest telling him the full truth. Or simply show him this post. Once confronted with the full story I'm sure he'd easily be able to make a decision based on what you've said. 

He deserves better. Your affair was just that, an affair. You claim things got blown out of proportions and that you never intended it to get this far. Yet it did, and you encouraged it. No one forced you to communicate with this guy behind your fiancé back. You had plenty of opportunities to stop and come clean, instead you continued to do so. The only reason your fiancé's aware of any of this is due to catching you in the act.

Understand that you've betrayed his trust. If you truly love this man tell him the full truth. Your affair was selfish, and so is your current attitude towards the effects of your actions. Your concerns towards marriage are mute, even if you do somehow convince your fiancé to stay and work things out, I doubt he'll consider marrying you so soon after this. 

First step towards reconciliation is showing remorse. You clearly can't do that, so I doubt this will ever work long term. Your fiancé deserves better then you."
why are girls like this 
"I'm sorry? WHAT?!?!?!?!?!

no OP just no. Move on"
"it’s not that big deal unless it’s made a big deal, a drink is equivalent to what exactly? lol it’s a kind gesture and all while saying thank you and not interested. 
it’s guys like you who let small things like this result in “getting your ass kicked” 
stop being so insecure and letting a 10$ get to your head lol"

"The ""hall pass"" was a test:  do what you want but the consequences are not removed, i.e. if you cheat the relationship is over.

You failed big time.

I'm not sure what you feel for her, but love it isn't.  

In any case, you're not going to break up with her, she's going to break up with you.  Not fixable, nothing you can do about it, no amount of apologizing will fix this.

So yeah, go ahead and order dinner, might as well eat."
A) I think OP may be beyond the whole Gift of Fear thing. B) Are you a bot?
"Ha, good one.

I don't know. They are not worth my time. Either way no matter what she says it's gonna prolong my misery and give raise to more insecurity and incertitude in myself. I am out of this toxic stew, they can fuck each others lives as far as I am concerned"
"He's playing games. The way he talks in those messages, being vague, he's not being straightforward, being flaky.

I've been with guys like this and it's not normal or mature. "
"It's tangential to the topic, but regarding lying, I read it somewhere that ""Honesty is a privilege, and you have to earn it"", and it has kinda stuck with me, and has forced me to view 'lying' in a different light. Like you, I used to view lying as intrinsically bad; no ifs, no buts. Lying = bad. But, come to think of it, someone not lying to you is a privilege you got to earn from them. If I ask someone their religion, and if there is an indication that I might be violent if they don't answer it in a certain way, of course they are going to lie. It is an extreme example, but, I used it to illustrate that people lie to us when they think their truth won't be well received. Now, I am not saying this justifies lying in all situations, no not at all. The crux of what I am saying is, if people lie to you, that means they don't trust you with the truth. The reason for that could be one or more of i) their own insecurity ii) the truth itself is inconvenient and shows them in bad light iii) we would attack/punish/give-trouble to them for the truth. So, it might be helpful to examine these things if you have a partner who lies to you. "
Please keep yourself safe and get out of this abusive relationship. 
"Can you two hangout during the daytime or on the weekends?

I'm gonna be honest. I also would not like going anywhere alone late at night. I would not be willing to use an uber at night alone. I like to stay safe. I think it is good that you value your safety. It is better to be safe than sorry.

Maybe you or your boyfriend can hangout during the daytime or the weekends, or perhaps one or both of you can eventually get a car. "
Just tell him that Addie Mae seems really basic now that you think of it and she’d be happier as an __________. 
"Eh, in the scheme of things, this probably isn’t as big a deal as it seems. I don’t believe in ‘ownership’ of names and, frankly, once you have a real live baby in front of you to take care of 24/7, the question of who thought of the name becomes waaaay low on your priority list. 

What is a much bigger deal is: you don’t trust your husband. Whether that distrust was warranted in this particular situation or not, that’s a huge issue. I think the name thing actually isn’t about the name, but more that it’s emblematic of the lack of trust between you.

My advice? Table the baby conversation and see a counselor together. Believe me, any issues you currently have are going to magnify 10 fold when you’re both sleep-deprived and figuring out how to parent together. 

TL;DR: the baby name is a red herring, but the trust issue is an actual problem.

"
"That’s what she’s feeling too, friends and see what happens. Should’ve mentioned I’m trying to move from upstate NY where we are to Philly area for work so that complicates things. 

Never been one to leave things up to fate, leaves me feeling like I gotta push my chips in or fold them. I think this is some good advice, thank you genuinely for the reply :)"
Don't shortchange yourself. You deserve the best. You deserve someone that lifts you up and makes you want to be a better version of yourself. 
"Honestly it is offensive. That is a gross generalization and misconception of Muslims and really it is a bit hateful to use religious tenants to take a bite out of your boyfriend. Consider not offending a group of people when you are trying to make your boyfriend feel like shit, because it makes you seem like an asshole at best and at worse you are just a bigot. ""Sorry for any offense"""
"Did you like the name? That is all matters not whose idea was it. I m sure if you google the name you will find out exactly what it means and what is the origin, it is not your husband’s ex, she just gave him an idea like any other friend could. Please don’t make it a big deal (from a female to another female), small things shouldn’t cause big problems, as long as you two are happy, like the name and agree on it the rest doesn’t matter. "
"Communication, tell him about these things. Tell him you aren’t trying to force him to change, but if he doesn’t, then you both gotta move on and that’s how it is.

It won’t be an overnight thing, it is difficult for people to change, but what matters is if people TRY. And people try for the ones they love. You will know when the time comes, but it seems as if you’ve already moved past this point.

You seem as if you’ve already made your mind up, and that’s fine. "
"Life's short, take what you can from that relationship, remain friends don't pressure a 22 year old into getting back together.

Always leave the door ajar, if you guys have the same path it'll work if not be cool with letting go. :)
"
"Wow, what a selfish asshole. I'd end a relationship over this kind of entitlement. You're still in the honeymoon phase, and she's showing what a nightmare a future with her will be. Nope nope nope. Fuck her, man. We aren't allowed to use any of the words that would accurately describe your girlfriend in this sub."
"This post is real, I promise. My therapist and school counselor are really the only ones who know anything about this, but I have not spoken to Balthazar in a long time, and he has made no attempts to message me. So currently, I am safe. "
"I also have trouble expressing excitement in front of others but I've never gotten a response like this. Its understandable to want your partner to be more vocal about their feelings but asking someone to act exactly a certain way seems very controling. The ""waifu"" character that they want you to play is also usually submissive and fragile. Some people are into that but it doesn't seem like you are so I do not think you guys are compatible. Their maturity level is far below yours. "
"It's been several years since they had that conversation, right? So it's entirely possible he forgot where he heard the name and just likes it (it's called source memory error and it happens all the time). I'd ask him where he got the name and see what he says... if he says he can't remember, I'd ask if it was a name he ever talked about with his ex. That might prompt him to remember if he has forgotten where he heard it. Whatever happens you're gonna have to tell him you snooped. 

If he did lie about it, then that's a massive problem given his history of not being truthful with you. "
"I’m going through this same thing. My girlfriend broke up with me a 2 weeks ago. We are around the same age as you guys (18, 17) and had been dating for what would’ve been 2 years in a little under a month. 

I, like you, an still in love with her but you and I must come to a understanding that they’re done with us and they’re not going to magically come back. I know you wish she would come back, but she’s not going to and I’m sorry to tell you. The way i’m coping with it is by hanging out with friends, avoiding my bedroom as much as possible, and staying active.

She was my first love also, so I understand your pain. You’re probably tired of hearing this just like I am but trust me, you’ll get over it. I don’t know about you but after the first week I my heart felt heavier than the world but now it’s settled and although I still miss her, I’ll soon forget about her and grow stronger and I’m sure you will too. 

Hang in there and trust the process. Know you’re not alone because i’m sure many others are going through what we are my friend."
"IDK, I live in a small town and it doesn't work like that here. I have seen/encountered plenty of my exes over the years here. And I have mutual friends with some of them. "
"This comment should be at the top!  Spot on, rethink the relationship in general not intentionally bring kids into it.  "
"Have you actually asked him where he got the name? 

I think you need to give him at least the chance to tell the truth. 

I mean, he probably should have told you, but he may not see it as a big deal and just really likes the name. "
Sorry for not clarifying.  I have packed my things and left.  We are done.
Don’t regret moving on to better things. Trust that you made the right decision for you.

"Well, she sounds awful. When my partner and I started dating, he would pay often. We were both poor students but later on made an effort to split costs when dinner was pricier or alternate. Now after 5 years we pretty much split things evenly and when I can afford it, I buy him a burger here and there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her behavior is super selfish and inconsiderate. "
"People here sound absolutely crazy.

It's a NAME. Is how you guys ended up with a name that big of a deal? His ex suggested it from YEARS back, he remembered it, and liked it, and suggested it. You liked it, and that's that. Even the message itself is super nonchalant, and from when they were together: ""IF we get married..."" It's not even an extremely defined thing they were dead-set on. 

Would you be as horrified if she had suggested ""Let's visit Spain"" and then you found this out right before you guys took a vacation to Spain? How about if his ex suggested that they watch Lord of the Rings, but the relationship ended, so then he suggested watching Lord of the Rings. Would that also be devastating if you found the message? What else is possibly off limits, please his ex may have suggested it years ago? Skiing? Scubadiving? Watching Game of Thrones? Cooking classes? Reverse Cowgirl? 

He's wants to have the child with YOU, for god's sake. 

What are you really worried about here? That he wants to name the future child after his ex's idea because he has this longing for a woman he hasn't contacted in many years? And that he's so desperate for any type of connection that he'll name his future child after this idea, so that he can savour the old memories of a past relationship? 

Let's not forget that you said he has markedly improved in terms of not lying anymore, and you, in your insecurity, looked for something that wasn't there. You said that he has had no contact with his ex since you guys were together, but you decided to scroll up anyways to read into conversation he's had with his ex while he wasn't with you. This is some shady as hell behaviour, especially when you make it sound so casual, saying a conversation caught your eye. Let's be honest here, it's obvious that you were looking at each message fairly closely, and must've scrolled up quite a bit, as I sincerely doubt they day after she mentioned the name, they broke it off. 

If you're really that distrusting of him to the point where you are willing to snoop on his PAST conversations from many years ago while he was in another relationship, even though you already knew his ex hadn't contacted him, you guys should definitely not have a kid together. "
"I just had this exact conversation with my friend about her boyfriend telling ridiculous lies over  ""small"" stuff. I don't think she took it to heart. Sigh."

"WHEN DID PEOPLE START TO GET COPY RITES ON NAMES!!?! 

&amp;#x200B;

Exes shouldn't ever see each other again! So who cares?"
If you don't trust this guy you should seriously consider *not* trying for a baby. 
I had an ex who would hide things to spare my feelings. It's incredibly insulting. He decided how I would feel about things before I ever had an opportunity to. So I was left confused... I was upset he hid something from me but wanted to show it was something I wouldn't have been upset about if he had been honest.... Ugh so frustrating. Just be fucking honest.
"Haaaa, my heart is beating so fast right now feels like I am going to die right now.

I called my friend earlier, she told he is a piece of shit and I should never talk to him"
"Go to your parents. Either hers, or yours. If you don't feel comfortable going to your parents for some reason, then go to a school counselor or even a trusted teacher. The assumption is that it will eventually wind up there, but with your parents at your back. 

Do not take a 13 year old's advice on this topic. Her biggest worry would probably be getting in trouble, seeming lame/being a snitch or having her phone taken away, instead of about how scary it is to have a person sexually harassing/borderline stalking you.

Not to mention inciting a mini-mob in the days of ""no tolerance"" schooling is just stupid. "

"&gt;I can't see how the Mom doesn't know at this point. 

A lot of people use this as an excuse to not tell. But I have a few friends who have been cheated on and when they found out that they had ""friends"" who knew and didn't tell them, they said it added an even deeper layer of betrayal where they felt that they couldn't trust a single.person in their life. Please do not use that as your reason for staying silent."
"If I knew how the use this reddit thing, I would give you gold! Your comment is spot on on so many levels. I was literally nodding yes with every sentence. 

Anyway, I, unfortunately, ended up in an emotional affair (please don’t judge, just listen). I was the single one, he married. If only we would have done what you said up there. If only we could see what was at the end of the tunnel instead of trying to run through it and slamming into a brick way. Our brains knew that it wasn’t right and we should end it right away. Our hearts couldn’t stop. It was never physical, only emotional. And now, honestly, I would be more likely (which now that I think about it, no) to forgive a partner for a sexual affair than an emotional affair. What I’m saying is, that would tear my heart out to know that my husband connected with another woman on that deep level would truly tear my heart out. 

To me, a connection with a person that you have an emotional affair with is probably one of the deepest connections you’ll ever have in your life. It’s like a drug. You know you’re gonna get high, so you chase it. So, before you get addicted to this drug, stop it. Which, it sounds like you have. Now, it’s going hurt like hell for a while. Power through it and stay present at home. Remember that you love her and pour into her. Eventually, you’ll be ok and everything will be ok. 

Just stay away. "

"Not to be rude but it's just VERY odd that someone that much older would be with someone that much younger. People might think there is manipulation and grooming going on. I don't want to think that, but 24 is not that old. Source, am 23 with friends in my age range. I have friends that are 27-28 that said they would be weary of someone in their late 30s. A decade is a long time to develop for most people. "
Call Police.  You can't allow someone to take your car without permission.
Maybe you should go with the name Addie Mae ;)
"Counseling is a MUST. Couples therapy. A lot of marriages can be pulled back from the brink with this. Most couples have no idea how to be in a healthy relationship because they’ve received no education on how to do so. 

She does sound verbally abusive right now and that’s not ok. Her behavior needs to change. And therapy may be a place for her to share her side of things without feeling like she has to go on the attack. 

She is the pursuer and you are the withdrawer. This is common in marriages but you feed off each other in a bad cycle. Trust me I’ve been there and I’m not there now thanks to GOOD therapy. "
This should be the top comment
Questions is your resentment more jealousy focused?

"If you don't want to go, tell her that you feel uncomfortable attending as her past romantic partner and that you'd rather not. Just be honest."
I agree there. Before all this I never even looked at other women and didnt even think to stray. I also would get out of any situations I felt were uncomfortable for the marriage. 
"Block and never look back. He's a manipulator, he has no care or resurrect for you."
So...you were out with your coworkers. Are any of them male?
I'll get on that once I get my winning lotto ticket.
"After reading both your updates, he is such a piece of shit. You definitely deserve better and you will find it one day! For the time being, try your best to keep your mind occupied elsewhere like work or hobbies since you say you're family and friends are far. You will heal. "
"No offence brother... ditch that ‘woman’asap.
"
What was the nature of you accidentally running into them? Besides the red flags everyone else has commented on - that is your home. Why is she bringing an ex to your home without you knowing? Did she think you wouldn’t find out? Would she not tell you? That’s just as strange to me as her leaving out that he was her ex. 
Man this hurt to read because it's true. It's high time I confront the truth that all the facts point to.
"I don't wanna be a downer but if you're looking at staying in your preferred career (fine arts/film industry/etc) you are in 100% the wrong place. You're really only going to find that on the east coast, specifically in either Sydney or Melbourne. Perth has an arts scene but nothing really professional - most of the people in the arts I know who are from Perth all moved to Melbourne for their careers, there are heaps of them here."
Hold up...y’all are 25????
"Call someone. A friend, a family member, anyone. Just don't be  in your own head right now.

"He got with you because you’re young, won’t  enforce your boundaries and he could enforce power over you. 

Now looked what happened, he did just that. This is a PATTERN in this sub: guy gets with a girl who is much younger than him and he abuses her. She has battered women’s syndrome and comes here because she thinks he is great except for this one tiny thing like he choked her and kidnapped her. 

You’re immature and he took advantage of that. You need to leave unless you want him to kill you. 

Next time get with someone your own age and stick up for yourself when abuse occurs. "
"It took me a while to get over my first gf, so you're definitely not alone there. But I eventually did. I remember like a year or two after, after I had pretty much forgotten about her and was entering into something with another girl, I suddenly found myself ready to release all the bullshit she put me through. It was like my body was finally ready to let go. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fresh wounds may feel like scabs for a while, but then they turn into scars, and then into numb feelings that don't matter anymore."
"I’ve immediately stopped playing when my gf wants my attention or wants to do something. I would never put video games over a loved one... that’s so stupid. I will admit that I’ve neglected the house chores (dishes, tidying up, etc. but not laundry, that’s done between games lol) "
"I honestly don't think this relationship is the best thing for you. You obviously don't trust him now. All these years he has been wanting to name his daughter a name that his ex came up with , so there is some serious crap that needs to be dealt with. Plus there isn't trust in your relationship. You shouldn't be in a relationship when you can't trust your partner."
"Moving in triggers a LOT of relationships to crumble or struggle. It’s a bump that a lot of couples experience. This would be the same situation if you moved in together in 5 years. The problems will still be there. 

I think you should seek counseling. Couples therapy specifically, not just therapy. Most people need some education about how to be in a healthy relationship. When my husband and I first moved in, we constantly bickered and had issues. It was an adjustment period. Now after like years of living together I can finally say we know ALL of each other’s quirks and pet peeves "
"This is a really hard one to answer. Do you guys have any problems? Any sort of voids in your relationship? Im not trying to put doubt in your mind, but chemistry doesnt take but 2 ingredients sometimes (Her husband lacking something that he has, or visa versa). Do you guys have good communication? Talk to him about it. Just because you trust him and you think that nothings going on, doesnt mean anything. Like i said, im not trying to cast doubt but you have to look at it objectively, not emotionally. "
"You need to walk away. If you respect your female friend and your wife, don’t fuck it up. It only will create more problems.    

The heartache you feel now is temporary. Focus on your relationship at home. "
"Sounds like a narcissist. This is absolutely abusive, extremely toxic/unhealthy at the least. 6 months is nothing, leave this guy. "
"Yikes. Sounds like a bad situation that is out of your control. Better to just keep your distance, nothing you can do if only one person is making an effort."
"I almost downvoted out of anger, OP.  He is literally telling you he wants you to be an object and a slave."
"Well one option is to get additional therapy for this, which is going to cost money and time, and another would be to think about buying a cheap car and paying for the upkeep so that you have a feeling of safety and independence to enable you to drive wherever you want, whenever you want. I mean this could be one of those lifestyle changes that has a really positive impact, possibly more so than going to specific therapy for trauma and intimacy. It’s not unexpected that these experiences you had are affecting your intimacy with your boyfriend, and I think you need to get some specific help for that. But don’t throw away the idea of having your own car so that your specific anxiety about getting into cars with strange men at night will go away, you would never have to do that again. For a couple thousand bucks, and then about 100 a month in gas and insurance? Not a bad deal."
My Grandparents have had separate beds for the last 40 years and are past their 60th anniversary. They still cuddle and hold hands but they both absolutely do not enjoy sleeping scrunched up next to the other person.
"See a therapist. I'm not saying that to be mean, this is something that fundamentally doesn't make sense to be insecure about since as you say you trust him, you were out with coworkers and you're on good terms with her. Nothing happened, don't bootstrap this into a fight. "
"Yeah, brother. Solid advice. "
"LoveIsRespect.org can help. 

You can't fix abusers. All you can do is leave them."
"Just wanted to say I have mad respect for you having your financial shit together enough to buy a home at 22! I’m 27, and if I can become a homeowner in the next 5 years I’ll be pretty happy about that. I’d say that’s a way bigger personal achievement than being lucky enough to meet the man of your dreams at 22. "
"it’s not even about having a crush. sure trying to be friends with someone you’re crushing on sucks, but it doesn’t exempt you from respecting their boundaries, so that one’s squarely on him still... he SHOULD be able to at least act civilly around her, even while harboring a crush."
"i agree with your friends. he is only sticking his beak in cos he's got competition. tell this guy you're no longer intererested and block him, then go have fun with new guy :) where are you going to take him for a date? i bet it'll be a lot of fun :)"
"Contact your siblings. If he didn't tell them the truth that sucks, but you all have a right to know each other regardless of what he wants. "
Please give me some useful advice. It feels like I am being chainsawed to madness and pain right now.
"&gt;“I would be so happy if you were like an anime maid”.

Dump this freak like... yesterday."
"I think what's important here is whether you two have the level of partnership and commitment you'd both like.  Perhaps it's not the legal/public confirmation of marriage you'd like, but knowing he's not just enjoying something causal seems important.  Would calling him your ""Partner"" be a fair balance between more than a boyfriend but not with the negative triggers of husband (for him).

Maybe he would consider a casual by romantic vow ceremony with your closest friends, something beautiful but also not expensive either, like a back yard party under some christmas lights... just to have a nice public recognition (assuming it's only the financial/divorce aspect he's worried about)

As I've mentioned elsewhere, it is prudent to seek out separate financial and legal advice as needed to ensure your interests are protected (ie, if this relationship breaks up, you aren't in a worse financial situation and/or just spent years paying down his mortgage).

"
"Be ready. He's going to turn on the manipulation afterburners. He's going to tell you it wasn't that bad and that you remember it wrong. He's going to tell you that he didn't mean it and that it was the drugs and he was fucked up and he'll give them up forever. He's going to tell you that it was a huge mistake and that he's so sorry and that he'll kill himself if you leave him.

He will pull out every single manipulation tactic in the book to try to stop you from leaving.

You need to be single-minded. Act with purpose. Avoid him at all costs. Do not see him in person alone AT ALL.

Make a plan. Call the domestic violence hotline if you need help organizing the plan. Figure out where you're going to go. Gather all of your important documents like birth certificates, titles, insurance, social security cards, passports, bank statements. Pack what you need for the short term and GET. OUT. You can get the rest of your stuff later with a police escort."
So tell me how saying things like “…it speaks volumes about OP…” isn’t judgemental.
What kinds of things do you want to know about them? Come up with questions—direct and indirect—that will steer the conversation. Discussing hypothetical situations (i.e. what would you do?) really lends itself to this sort of thing. Your job is to make it seem casual and off the cuff.

"Normal behavior if you're her sugardaddy. A relationship goes both ways, you give and you take. After a while this one sided stuff gets really old. She should want to treat you once in a while and make you feel special. I couldn't be with someone like that. I would toss some money to her, apologize for the inconvenience and tell her it's over. How selfish can you be that you get upset over paying for your boyfriends meal. She sounds like the type of woman who wants to be a trophy wife and not do shit and let her man pay for her. Move on. "
Bring the conversation up again. Do not let it go without a straight answer.
I'm so sorry that you are going through this. The only advice I can give is that you 100% don't want someone that would put you through all this in your life. 
You should be asking him that question. Bring it up as I have enjoyed spending time with you and would like to be exclusive. 
Shes  it going to the range with him after work but shes probably holding his gun. Possibly making more videos. There are 2 billion females out there just like her. Go find someone else.

"Do you love her and want to be with her forever?

If Yes: Marry Her. It interrupts absolutely nothing in life and you get to have a wedding which is fun.

If No: Break up. You're wasting her time."
"Right?  Like even using it once was a risk no matter how much she said she was cool with it and regardless of how much she might have actually believed that she WAS cool with it.  

To solicit sex from multiple people on the internet?  He went nuclear on this relationship.    "
"Even though she doesn't want children she does want to nest, create a cozy home, live together, be a married couple, have some idea where her life is going. If you don't even want to live together, my guess is you really don't want to marry her and there are some hesitations about her."
"He said she was asking for the money back from all the meal including hers, im pretty sure the old traditional views do apply here, shes an old traditional golddigger."
"You don't know if you want it to be over? If you had died as a result of him strangling you, that's called murder. And this went on for half an hour? Honestly, it sounds like you were lucky to make it out of there at all. You are in danger. Please do not go back. Don't think of it like resolve about ending the relationship, thinking of it like you doing what you have to do to protect your own life and preserve your safety. I hope that you can re-read what you've written here and realize how bad this is anytime you are wavering. It is not ambiguous at all. "
"He's still going to be uncomfortable. He's not going to stop being awkward by telling you. All he's going to accomplish is hearing you reject him out loud instead of just in his head.

You just want him to tell you so you can be smug about it and rub it in and when he finally meets a girl who DOES like him and who he likes, you can make it weird for him.

I honestly don't know why you're doing this to this poor guy. You're leading him on for your own ego and its gross. Why don't you just date people who you're actually interested in?"

"I guess I just can't comprehend men not stepping up because my own husband does, if the relationship is important to him, as do most of the other men I know. He barely talks to and doesn't make effort toward his family but there's a history of emotional abuse there so he's protecting himself. He has plenty of friends, some of who he's had 20+ years so long before I came on the scene, who he sees and does things with and remembers presents for, etc. The only friendship I've seen him let die since we got together was his friend who was supposed to be in our wedding party but flaked and just... didn't show up or give an explanation, and dodged all his calls when we got back from the honeymoon, and my husband was pretty put out by that and stopped trying (and surprise! we've heard from the guy all of one time in the past six years). And my dad also communicates with people - less so than my mom but he's introverted and she's outgoing, and he would be doing just fine without her. Same with my brothers/uncles/cousins/male friends/coworkers, though there may be some level of selection bias there since obviously the people I am in contact with are those who are willing to do social planning. So it's hard for me to understand that they wouldn't step up or if they wouldn't, why she would, since the only instances I ever see irl of men not stepping up are where it's fine with them if the relationship dies. And I think you shouldn't hang on to relationships for other people if they're not invested because it's just making things more complicated."

It’s not that I am choosing not go. I’ve even tried to book an appointment through tears and then the day comes and I have a meltdown and can’t go.
Just beat her in every game and she’ll lose interest. 
What do you see in this girl? Lol
You could go to the house and ring the doorbell at normal hours with a clipboard and pretend to be a donations collector or a Jehovah's witness to see who lives there :0
Did you read the post?
Wowwww how self centered are you?
"Right?? He lied about stopping after trying to he say he was stopping for *her*, not because it's a shitty thing to do.

He doesn't want to stop lying. He wants OP to stop thinking he's lying and calling him out on it. "
"Good job, for real.  This guy was using money as a weapon.  It's not actually nice or a gift if it's used to control and shame you.  "
My family do that plus the loser he never graduated:(
I am pretty sure this is common behaviour for her. After all she chose to take him back so many times during this 5 years. She made her choice long ago. I want out of this. 
"Literally anytime anyone would call out his shitty behavior, she would mention him being bullied in school. Since when does that excuse shitty behavior of a 25 year old?"
"0.0002% equates to 1 in 5000 or so. Thinking about how many people use this subreddit, it doesn't seem that unlikely that it happened to someone here. Poor girl was just horribly unlucky. "
Please calm down with the assumptions. Gynecologists and doctors in general give me some horrid anxiety because of past assault and AWFUL racist doctor experiences. It has nothing to do with maturity. 
hell yeah! i can feel the relief from here!
"Why not just play on a schedule? You already see her a few times a week, so why not sit down and play then? Just explain that it'd be easier to interact and have fun as opposed to those drawn out games"
Your relationship sounds like it has run its course. It sounds like you’re not getting anything from it and she has broken your trust by cheating. More fulfilling relationships are in your future. 
Oh no I have. I know exactly what would happen. But literally even thinking about it makes me incredibly anxious and makes my eyes start to tear up. I can’t bring myself to do it. 
"Way to go !
That's the spirit you need and I'm glad you're strong enough to not fall after that. I really admire that in you.

As for men, don't ""look"" for stuff to happen. It will happen in time. You're 27, you're clearly not that old and you'll get plenty of great opportunities. Make the best out of it and you'll be fine !

Anyway, thanks for sharing your story and inspiring me, good luck and go enjoy life :p"
"I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and support.
I started calling my husband everyday and he surprised me on my birthday too. 
Then I realised that I missed my husband too. We have been married for so long, we must have been taking each other for granted.
It's a small start, but I feel quite hopeful for us.
And I saw my friend today after a long while and I'm happy to say that I could talk to him without overthinking anything.
Thank you everyone! Communication is definitely the key! "
Get over it and move on ...or leave simple 
Great insight and I dig the username 💀⚡️🌹 
"I mean, you're not wrong, but it's still horrible to hear. I don't think I was ever really passive; I think I was too strong in myself and scared guys away. And now I'm like, ""...but wut do I do."" I told my therapist that I'd thought about just finding someone to take my virginity and rip the bandaid off (once I'm cured of vaginismus, of course) and she was like, ""Well, that's not the worst idea ever...""  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
They're still pretty young for that. Especially since the motivation for the proposal would be just so that they can live together and not piss off his parents. 
"Well, they can rationalize it the way they want, they’re leading the men on in order to get the drink. Accepting a drink that comes with second intentions isn’t being courteous, it’s being misleading. 

What’s keeping the women you know from saying they’re not interested in what the drink implies? I’ll tell you: not getting free drinks. 

It’s not even about money, probably more about validation and feeling good for being hit on. 

OP says she wouldn’t mind the opposite because this is not a realistic scenario. "
"Yeah, look up ""movers for domestic violence"" and there are lots of resources. Hopefully there's something available to you. I did the same thing as you - moved out of an abusive ex's place while he was at work one day. It's very liberating."
I’m sorry to hear that this has been your experience! It might be helpful to book an appointment in to discuss your concerns about getting a pelvic exam done instead of jumping right in! 
"Right? 

I feel like I'm in an alternative universe, but then i remember that this is how /relationships is sometimes. 

The amount of comments i read about how terrible the husband is and how he's a compulsive liar is absolutely shocking. OP dug, and dug, snooping FAR past why she decided to snoop, which was something felt ""off"" and checking for **recent contact! ** Let's be honest, OP kept going further and looked at private conversations between her boyfriend and his ex when **they were together** as a couple. This is gross. OP was looking for something to be upset about and found a private conversation between a couple. 

How did so many users skipped past this this HUGE detail? That's a red flag if I've ever seen on. I'm seeing also the discussions on lying by omission. That's ONE way to look at it if viewed through the scope of demonizing OP's boyfriend. What's more plausible is OP's boyfriend liked the name. People are who they are from their experiences. I find it interesting seeing advice being given to OP that's basically suggesting she lies by omission. 

This is weird."
"Don’t message her out of revenge. 

Message her because she’s likely an innocent party and has a right to know. 

Don’t take your anger out on her. Give her the same compassion you would give a friend. It’s not her fault. "
"Maybe talk to your girlfriend and see if she'd be chill with you bringing both her and Ashley to prom, then? You could buy her the classic flowers and take her with you guys to dinner, make her feel not left out? But youd have to be willing.

Honestly, prom is a big deal to you now, but most people forget about their prom. There will be better nights in your life :) Don't put so much stress on it (or remind the girls not to!)"
He’s gaslighting you
"As great as routine can be, sometime a break from the norm is best. Throw out the rules. It’s good for all parties involved, so long as deregulation doesn’t become the norm. A little bit of chaos goes a long way"
"He knows his crush will pass, so he doesn't need to say anything, knowing you don't want to date him anyway. If things he's doing make you uncomfortable, you can enforce proper boundaries (no cuddling in bed and ""jokingly"" inviting him to shower) without having a talk about his feelings. 

And maybe back off your ""joking"" comments. If he's truly making you uncomfortable (versus enjoying and even seeking the attention and validation), you should want his crush to pass, right? So stop feeding it by making sexual innuendoes and cuddling on beds with him. "

You made a good point
"If one considers a relationship to be *bad* then they are a lot less likely to remember the good times. When I think about my ex-boyfriend I mostly think about the time he tried to kill himself, all the angry phone calls I would receive from him, the emotional blackmail, etc.  I think we probably had good times in there, but I don't really remember them all that well because the bad times took up so much of my energy.

Did you talk one time?  Then maybe she was trying to gently let you know the mistakes you made so that maybe you won't make them again in the future.  Regardless, you don't tell someone you don't remember anything good about them and want to be friends with that person.  I'd take what she said into consideration and move on."
"You've got no chance with her anymore, please don't creep her out further. "
"You’re deluded to think that looking for confirmation of deceit is worst that being deceitful. 

It’s not natural or human nature to deny oneself the right to not be willingly deceived by another. Trust is not something you grant against your better judgement but the natural occurrence when someone is TRUSTWORTHY. "
You're definitely over thinking this. Just relax and have fun. If she cancels on you then you know that it's not gonna work out. But definitely just chill out and have fun. 
"If you are considering it now, it doesn’t get better. You are at your prime age for having fun. Don’t be looking for the one just yet or you might regret it"
"Can you start visiting a therapist as well? You need to learn to set healthy boundaries. Remember, put on your own mask before helping those seated around you. "
"He just liked the name. I don’t think it should be something you should be upset about. At least it would be you guys’ kid, and I’m assuming your first child. If he’s faithful to you, no longer speaks to this person like he’s still interested, then she has nothing to do with your relationship. And it was said in the past, so it should remain there"
He sounds like a giant douche. This random internet stranger is incredibly proud of you for leaving.
yeah my mom is clingy and i really wanna spend time with her because she seems genuine but at the same time ive been hurt before and i gave up on relationships for a while and im finally wanting to get back into them and me and this girl seem to have a lot in common. I just dont wanna be played because i dont usually trust people easily but this girl won my attention and i just dont know how to handle it because being homeschooled has caused me to get attached quickly to people who take time to listen to me
That’s what me and my bf do too! We have two queen mattress just in the floor next to each other. You can cuddle but also have your own beds and space to move.
"Wow, your words and perspective is powerful and I’m grateful for writing. But truly how selfish he is to have done something tying you and your future family to his ex FOR LIFE. How can you believe his fidelity and loyalty if he’s willing to do this thing? This thing that will forever be a reminder of his ex? 

This sort of things terrifies me. Liars terrify me. You can be driven mad by someone lying, and I never buy into it being for anyone or anything other than themselves. Deceit is a destroyer of trust and the quickest way to destroy the foundation love is built on. "
"&gt;if I really wanted to because she didn't want me to break up with her over something like that 

She only gave you this ""hall pass"" because she legitimately thought that you would break up with her if you didn't have ""permission"" to sleep with someone else. C'mon man

What relationship

"The majority of my coworkers are age 25–31 and almost none of them are married? Some are engaged, but...quite a few are single. You’re really not that old! You still have lots of time to find love.  "
"Having a child and starting a family changes things. Before you decide to bring another life in this world, a serious discussion is needed on his behaviour. Losing trust and starting a family on a rocky foundation is never a good start as things may crumble and it would be the child who will be affected the most. Talk things through, tell him how his actions affects your feelings and mental state. He needs to know that his choices should be made in the best interest of the family and that lying will only cause dig the hole deeper."
