"There's a book called Too Good to Leave Too Bad to Stay that is pretty much designed for cases where ""I love my partner but I have this niggling doubt that maybe they just aren't *quite* right for me."" Maybe get it from the library and give it a read? But NOT anywhere your boyfriend can see it, especially if you decide to stay. And if you do decide to stay, remember that grass is greener where you water it."
"Revenge? Your best revenge will be when he‚Äôs still browsing date apps while you are in a new, respectful and serious relationship. Even better revenge‚Äîwhen you get engaged to a loving and stable man and he is still sexting w strangers. 

You know this isn‚Äôt ok, don‚Äôt you? 
You know boyfriends don‚Äôt normally have casual internet hookups? They stay faithful and true. 
He‚Äôs also a lot older than you. 31 year old men usually have more goals than ‚Äúego boosts‚Äù from women online. 

You have so much time to find a great guy who WON‚ÄôT do this to you. This is dysfunctional !

I know you are going to be kicking yourself when u meet a faithful man and realize the dysfunction of this last relationship."
"This sounds miserable. Think really hard and be honest: do you WANT to ""save this""? This is who he is at his core. He's only agreeing to counseling because he's desperate to keep the life that he has in which he gets to do whatever and you clean up after him."
"R/legaladvice will give you good advice about how to get the money you received from your grandmother's will. If you are 18 they can't legally keep that from you. You will most likely need to hire a lawyer though.

In your post to r/legal advice keep it short and sweet, your age, state, that you got kicked out and your parents disowned you while holding on to your inheritance."
"A lot of teenagers don‚Äôt want to be adopted, he might not know that you feel that way.  He‚Äôs been a father figure to you for 3 years, I think you should tell him you‚Äôd like him to adopt you."
"Don't date someone who actively derides you. Your SO should build your confidence, not destroy it."
"But the thing with jokes is that he can't tell if you're serious.  

You need to ask so you can start planning your future one way or another.  

""Hey, FosterDad, I'm glad you're going through the surrogacy process and I hope it works out for you, but I was wondering what this means for my future.  I'm grateful for you and everything you've done for me, and I was wondering if you would adopt me, because I want to be a permanent part of your life and I want you to be a permanent part of my life."""
"Old man chooses to date someone his daughter's age and is surprised when she acts as such.

I'm sure Penny will realize they are not compatible at some point and get out of there. She sounds like fun, keep in touch with her."
Your boyfriend is an asshole. Who tries to make their SO jealous on purpose?
"Your first three things aren't even a little bit weird for straight guys, in my opinion. It was actually really great if him to defend your cousin from gossip.

The final thing is indeed weird. Trying to figure out if he's hi or gay isn't the right approach, though. It's a distraction from the real issue that he's delineated hiding something from you, whatever that is. Focus on that."
"""Remember that grass is greener where you water it"". This is so true."
"Ask A out when you feel comfortable doing so. Understand that the longer you wait, the higher the chance that someone else will ask him out and he'll become unavailable before you get an opportunity to ask him out yourself. Don't ""confess"" your feelings. That's a really awkward move. At least if he rejects your offer to go on a date, it's a lot easier to move on from it while staying friends."
This is abuse. Please leave him.
"what the fuck op.

He is your partner. He is not your supervisor.

If he wants THAT level of cleanliness, then HE can compensate and bleach the fucking floors everyday.

Op, he's not your dad.

Why are you so afraid to say ""I do a job that people get paid GOOD MONEY for, ALL DAY EVERYDAY. I don't get to clock out at the end of my work day, my work day doesn't end until I sleep. I won't tolerate that anymore. I'm GOING to take time for myself, and if something falls to way for that YOU CAN PICK IT UP because you're supposed to be my PARTNER not my BOSS."""
"""Stop. You're being annoying and it's rude to ask my sister to be unprofessional so you can meet a sports team. It's not going to happen, you don't have an in. Stop bringing it up."""
"You‚Äôre leaving, right?

Like, you‚Äôre planning out the move and sounding out your friends, right?

Imagine still being in this place in two months, 6 months, a year...

Please leave, OP. &lt;3"
Are you certain that Dave is not secretly in love with you?
"Your Aunt should be aware that your mum‚Äôs actions aren‚Äôt a reflection on how you feel, so I think anything you say will be good to start that reaching out process. Ask how your cousin has been, ask how your Aunt is doing. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a huge conversation to start."
"What is it that you love?

&gt;He has been my biggest cheerleader and supporter.

Of what"" You can't even get $15 out of the guy for a bra for heaven's sake. It seems like you can to way better, but you're suffering from sunk cost fallacy. Just because you wasted 14 years with him doesn't mean you have to waste the next 14 years.

When he sees you moving towards leaving, he will scramble for a little while and then go back to being the same person. Then you move to leave again and he tries to make amends. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO THREATEN TO LEAVE YOUR SPOUSE TO MAKE THEM BE NICE TO YOU? He doesn't love you. If he did, he wouldn't treat you the way he does. You're furniture to him. If you leave, he will have to get a replacement. There is no ""we"" here. He won't go to counseling with you, he won't make any changes. If you want to live like this for the rest of your life, go ahead, you know exactly what waits for you. Sounds like you're alone already. You can't do worse being single unless you really work at it."
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Thank you for the update and reinforcing the idea that cheaters project their behavior onto innocent people
"It is time for a come to Jesus talk. 

- Financially, she needs to start supporting herself. That means that she has to work more and volunteer less. 
- Traveling, she needs to either get a license, a bike, or a bus card. The taxi service stops now. 
- Emotionally, she needs to go and seek professional help. 

Honestly though, it might be time to call time on this. It sounds like it is taking a toll."
I didn‚Äôt actually see your initial post but this struck a cord with me as my dad committed suicide last month and I too now have choices to make about school. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss but well fucking done with those results! üíó as the Kris Jenner meme says you‚Äôre doing amazing sweety
"I think you should be straight forward and say something like ""Hey I was really surprised when you cried and hit me.  I meant to just do our fun jump scare, and I'm sorry it went bad.  Should we cut that out?""

I don't want to sound condescending, but when I was 16 my feelings and thoughts were all over the place.  Sometimes I'd get really upset and I didn't understand why.  I'd guess you either scared her way more than you meant to (she was totally engrossed in her phone and thought you were literally a murderer)
or she was just unusually upset."
"I think you should ask yourself why he was so insistent on you knowing she is attractive, flat out telling you to be jealous (which shouldn't have anything to do with what she looks like and everything to do with his intentions), and strongly insisting you should follow the Instagram account of the trip.      

I'd stop following the Instagram account if I were you, and stop texting ""david"". At the very least he's immature enough to get a kick out of making you jealous, and at worst he's setting you up to see him cheat. Fuck that noise, you can do better"
"I don't know if he'll keep responding to you, but if he does, it's easy to give some advice. Don't ask your brother to make peace with your mother. Don't ask him to contact her. Don't give your mother his contact details. Don't relay messages from your mother to him.

This is based on an assumption/guess on my part, but I'm fairly confident about it: your role as the 'peacemaker' translates, to him, as someone pushing back against the cutting-out that he (rightly or wrongly) felt he had to do. I'm guessing that one strike would be enough for him to cut contact with you again."
"Oh, thank you for the sub recommendation! I will definitely post there. I'm actually already meeting with a local lawyer about this on Wednesday and hopefully the money situation can be sorted out then."
"&gt;Am I justified feeling so annoyed? Should I really make a big deal of it?

YOU ARE UNDER REACTING. She is massively disrespectful and unkind. It‚Äôs as if she doesn't even care that you have feelings! If you haven‚Äôt told her off by now it‚Äôs about time that you did, and if she doesn‚Äôt change her ways I would stop making plans with her, or at least not waiting around for her."
"&gt;the fact that she usually is the one to plan stuff and initiate things (dates, sex, conversations, etc) because I‚Äôm pretty relaxed and usually just go with the flow. 

What do you guys do if she doesn't do all these things? Just sit next to each others?
Being relaxed and going with the flow sounds like an excuse for not being a active participant in this relationship. 
She wants you to take the initiative!"
"I‚Äôm really sorry this happened to you.

However, to be blunt, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with a man who‚Äôs parents make his life decisions for him."
"And while it‚Äôs not at the top of the priority list right now, once you‚Äôre stable and your education is secured I hope you‚Äôll take the time to work with a good therapist to unpack all this. Your parents‚Äô treatment of you has been *brutal*. If you have trouble moving past it (as anyone would), please ask for help."
"You don't need to vacuum everyday nor bleach the bathroom everyday nor mop the kitchen twice (you can sweep up or just vacuum the crumbs).  Stop doing those thing and see if he even notices (as long as you tidy up and wipe things down in the bathroom, how would he know it's not bleached?)  You're doing too much and it leaves you no time to decompress or relax for even a half hour.  Your life sounds like you're on a tread or grist mill with no end in sight.  I'd break with the pressure you're under.  Having a 9-5 job is tough but your job is a full 12 or more hours a day with no rest or appreciation.  Don't know how you've been doing it, nor how you've managed to bring two kids into the world with this much pressure."
"OP,

he KNOWS there is a double standard and he is making it that way on purpose."
"Do not bail her out.
My grandfather bailed out my uncle for 30 years. It tore apart his marriage. The guy learned nothing. He kept going and one day carried drugs across the border and got 5 years in federal.

Let her stay there.
It isn‚Äôt your problem."
"Yes call it a $500 life lesson and move on. If your boyfriend complins about you breaking up with him, tell him life happens."
"I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong here. It sounds like you and your boyfriend have different interests, and it also sounds like you are crushing a bit on your coworker, but that you haven't crossed any lines.

As to different interests: the important thing is whether or not you and your boyfriend respect each other. My wife and I have very few interests in common and talk deeply mostly about our kids and dogs and friends and each other, and not really in any depth at all about our jobs or hobbies. We have friends and coworkers for those things. We've been married 23 years. It would only be a problem if you looked down on him for not being into your things or he looked down on you for not being into basketball or cars.

As for a bit of crushiness: It happens. Thoughts are not actions. And again, so long as you aren't doing anything that is disrespecting your boyfriend (sharing intimate thoughts with coworker that you weren't with boyfriend, spending excessive time with coworker to boyfriend's detriment, etc), then this is just friendship. If the crush becomes uncomfortable, obviously you should back off long before you feel tempted to act on it, but ""emotional affair"" this is not."
"Your mom should've never paid for this mans debt.

IDK how much it was, but thats one of the biggest mistakes she's ever made.

No WAY she is ever seeing that money in full again."
"1. Schedule the appointment for the abortion. That your BF's parents are willing to pay for it is excellent, though if you are on your parents' insurance, depending on the state you live in insurance might cover it anyway. Ask the clinician you talk to at the hospital, women's health center or Planned Parenthood if you haven't already.
2. Change all the passwords to your accounts. Do not let your parents continue to have access to any digital accounts, messages, social media, etc.
3. Call Brown University's Counseling and Psychological Center. I'm not sure if you're covered yet by their services (depends on whether tuition has been paid yet) but you should tell them what your situation is and ask what advice they can provide on what your parents' refusal to pay tuition means for your ability to take out loans, be eligible for additional student aid, or housing, etc. You are NOT the first student to go through this. Crisis counseling centers at universities will be able to help guide you through your options.
4. Without knowing the details of the $75k your grandfather left you, my best advice on that front is to call a lawyer. In fact, you could post in r/legaladvice here on reddit and ask them. It's possible Brown also offers counseling on this matter and could put you in touch with someone.

I'm so, so sorry you're going through this. You don't have to talk about it or share details with anybody you don't want to. Finding out you're unexpectedly pregnant and going through your parents kicking you out is hugely traumatic and not something you need to share with people now or ever. Get your bearings straight. Also -- why is your boyfriend working on figuring out the abortion? Dude -- this is YOUR BODY. Do not leave that to be someone else's to-do."
"Wow ok. Fuck Jane, for one. She seems manipulative and attention seeking. Your husband is either an idiot or cares nothing about your feelings.

Your husband and Jane either have something going on, or Jane is so overprotective of her own husband that he can't do anything that involves you because she doesn't care for you."
"I wouldn't engage with Jenny at all, because if you disagree at all then she'll take it as evidence that you're ""after her man."" Instead, after commencement talk to Jack in private about what happened and make it clear that messaging you through his phone made you feel uncomfortable and was uncalled for.

If he didn't know about it, then you've informed him of a major red flag in his relationship. If he did know and let her send that message, then I would distance myself from this friendship. It sucks to lose a friend, but you've graduated and you're moving into a new phase of life! Don't be afraid to let go of people who bring unnecessary drama."
"she's telling you she doesn't want to go. it's making her stressed. you can tell her she's gorgeous and you don't care what people think, but you can't fix all the cultural baggage and prejudice in a couple days, so i would cancel and give her something that she WANTS and will actually make her happy."
"He is abusive. That is terrifying.

I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with some of your actions but, still, it is not okay for any man to yell at you like that ESPECIALLY when you are upset."
Make sure your daycare knows Grandma isn't on the approved pick up list.
"You should definitely talk to him about your desire to be adopted. You don't have to literally consider him your father to consider him family, and that's grounds for adoption. It's possible he didn't bring it up because he wanted the topic of adoption to come freely from you.

But more largely, you need to talk to him about the place you have in his life. I have a hard time imagining why someone wouldn't want to adopt you (you seem like an amazing kid!), but on the off chance he says no, you still have to talk about what he means to you and what you mean to him, and what your relationship is going to look like as you grow into adulthood.

You also need to talk about the baby! I can tell you one thing for sure: he's not having a baby because he ''wants a child''. He has a child! That's you. He's making a baby (and going through the big expense of doing so) because he specifically wants the experience of a baby. I understand how threatened you must feel, but this has an important advantage for you: no one can replace you, because having a teenager is completely different from having a baby. Your place in your foster dad's heart is unique and can't be competed with. He'll have a baby, and he'll also have a teenage son - you know, someone he can actually have conversations with and see grow into a man.

But your feelings of rejection and fear are real, and deeper than those usually felt by older siblings of a birth family. You have to have a heart-to-heart about this. It can be in person, or it can be a letter if you feel more comfortable. Something like:

''Hey, \[Foster Dad\]. I've been meaning to tell you something for a long time. Your home is the safest place I've ever been in, and that's where I want to grow up.

I've been thinking about this more seriously since you announced that you were starting the IVF process to have a baby. It's made me wonder if you also consider me your son, and I've been afraid that I might have to leave for another placement after you have your biological child.

I really don't want that, because over the three years we've been together, I've grown to love you as my family. Before the baby comes, I want to know what place I have in your life, and how you want our relationship to evolve in the future. As for me, I would want to make it official, and spend the rest of my life as your son. I would like you to adopt me.

Love,

\[Your name\]''"
"Is he not interested at all in his children? He doesn't eat with them? He doesn't play with them? He doesn't bring them to bed? He doesn't spend time with them on his day off? 

What does he do for you and the children? Besides the money? Because he'd have to pay after a divorce too, but you wouldn't have to clean up after him too..."
"I think he might know. I've made jokes here and there. Like trying to plant the seed. There was a father son thing going at school and I joked around saying if he adopted me we could do it together next year. We were talking about old people once and he mentioned how he hopes he dies before going to and old folks home. He says a lot of old people are treated bad. I joked that if he adopted me I'd take care of him when he was old so he wouldn't have to go to one of those places.

I know ice done that a few other Times. He usually just laughs along with me. Sometimes he gets quiet. I don't know if that's him considering it or not. I'm not sure. I hope so.

It's just awkward if I were to sit him down and ask him. Kinda terrified he'd say no. Which is why ive just joked around with it."
Does she find gratification or self-worth in anything else in her life? She might have latched onto the idea of Instagram attention as a replacement for value and happiness that she can't find elsewhere.
The way people treat animals says alot about their character.
"Your goal must *absolutely not* be to avoid offending anyone.


Your goal needs to be *never letting your child in a home filled with animal feces, rotting floors, and mold*.


You're going to offend someone. That's okay. That is not a bad outcome. You do not have to feel bad about that, or fix that.


You do not need to be rude, but you need to be clear, honest, and most importantly, firm.


""Husband, your parents' and grandparents' house is dangerous and unhealthy. I'm not visiting there anymore, and our child can't be there. We can host them here, or we can meet them somewhere else, but under no circumstances will I or our baby be in that environment."""
"Don't do anything. She wants to live in her reality, in which you weren't abused, she was a great mom with an insubordinate daughter who trash-talked her on twitter. That's how she sees it because she is either unwilling or unable to accept the truth. I'm sorry but the more you beg for her attention the more she feels entitled to your begging and apologies. If she wants no contact, give it to her. Live your life. Lean on friends."
"He's all out of anger and resentment for what? Having to provide for you as a child? For being the wrench in his plans to cleanly move on to his new woman? What can this man possibly add to your life that would benefit you? He will never be the father you want him to be. He started off with a line about how he's run out of the energy to be miserable to you and hopes that you'll just forget everything that happened. Not even a hint of an apology for anything he did. You were a *child* when this all went down, his responsibility was to care for you."
"I used to work as a foster care worker (I know, you already hate me, haha).  But here's the thing.  Either your social worker (or if you have one) your Guardian ad Litem can be a big help here.  I've had this conversation with my kids many times.  I was lucky in that I did have quite a few who felt safe enough with me to have me broach the subject with their foster parent for them.  From my experience it's about a 50/50 chance.  Some foster parents get into fostering to ""do their part"" and be there for a foster kid who needs a place to live and a shoulder to lean on for as long as needed.  Others are looking to add to their family.  But even if your foster dad doesn't want to adopt, I don't see him kicking you to the curb just because he wants a biological child also.  Are you legally free?  That's the first potential roadblock.  Are BOTH your biological parents relieved of their parental rights?  You need to have someone help you talk about this if you can trust your worker.  The only time I have seen a bad result from this (and I have been a part of a LOT of these talks) was with kids a lot younger than you.  People within the system are desperate to get kids younger than 10 into ""forever families"".  A friend of mine who was a foster parent  had two brothers.  One was 5, the other 6.  She had them since they were 2 and 3.  She was the only mom they remembered.  CPS tried to force her to adopt them.  She didn't want to because she was afraid to be left on her own with them.  But she signed a promise to be their foster parent as long as they wanted her to be.  It wasn't enough for CPS.  They sought out a more ""permanent"" home for those guys and ripped them away from her to be adopted to people willing to do a legal adoption.  You need to let your worker know upfront that you don't want to be adopted for adoption's sake.  You only want to do this if your foster dad is the one considered for adoption; that you have bonded with him and even if adoption is not in his plans that you want to stay with him until your 21st birthday.  That's another thing:  some unethical workers will try to force you out of foster care at your 18th birthday.  As long as you are working towards your independence (staying in school and/or working) the Chaffee Act says that you can  stay *exactly where you are* until your 21st birthday.  If you EVER need a knowledgeable, caring ear PLEASE don't hesitate to Private Message me.  This was my thing for a long while."
"It's not your job to patch up. Your boyfriend is supposed to deal with his family, including standing up for you. You are only required to be polite with them. You should be telling him what his family is saying, and he should be telling them to lay off.

But I'm not sure why you are dating this guy if you have no interest in parenting."
"You don't have to sleep with him just because you go over for dinner. Avoid alcohol, get to know him, and bow out. Or fake the flu."
"Imagine this: you wake up in a comfy bed. You start getting ready for your day. The house is just how you left it the night before. Maybe messy, maybe clean. You start to wake up in your kitchen, and play some of your favorite music. You get dressed in new clothes that make you feel fabulous. You head to work, or to a lunch date with friends. You order whatever you want. You go out later and enjoy your favorite hobby. You have plenty of money for all of this. You live alone. It's peaceful. He's paying his court ordered alimony, and you've got plenty of savings from forcing the sale of the house.
This could be you. Soon.
Divorce the financially abusing asshole. Life is absolutely better than this."
"&gt;He said if he didn't wanna be with me, he'd tell me and be honest.

That's the person he wishes he could be. The worst part about this is it's not *just* the affair, it's how he really enjoyed tearing you down to this other woman. 

And not just, ""Oh my wife doesn't clean enough or bring in enough money"" it's the grossest, most vile things you could say about a person. Hell, it's not even, ""My wife is having an affair so our marriage is dead."" -- he has this elaborate fantasy in which you're out fucking old men, that you're sloppy seconds, that he wishes he could beat you. That's fucking insane. 

This marriage is over. He's a cowardly piece of shit who has enjoyed spreading vicious lies about you to his affair partner. Once he can't avoid the truth he'll cry and beg and say he's ""just really messed up"" and he ""made a mistake"" or he's ""been really depressed for awhile"" or some other stupid shit. None of it's true. 

I can't imagine a worse betrayal. Remember, he never came clean to you about this. You had to find out from her. He's been stringing her along for months, possibly years, about leaving his wife, and she's tired of waiting and has realized he's full of shit and doesn't intend to divorce you. 

Email yourself a copy of the text messages and the video. Get to the doctor and get an STD test. Talk to your family and friends -- you'll need a lot of support right now. Hire an attorney. Don't move out of the house. 

I'm really sorry -- this is just absolutely devastating."
Oh god I didn‚Äôt notice the age difference at first in OP‚Äôs title.  Yeah there‚Äôs a reason why he‚Äôs dating someone so much younger.
He called your girlfriend a loose pussy. You‚Äôre kind of awful if you ever speak to him again after that. Some things can never be undone.
"He wants at least one of your kidneys. 

I'm sorry.  It sounds like you had to grow up too quickly.  It's so easy for parents to take advantage of their children if their kids are even remotely empathetic.  Or hurting. 

Keeping you from your gran was inexcusable.  Did his latest message even acknowledge any of this?  Was it about you or was it about him and his needs and feelings?"
"Get a therapist who specializes in PTSD, anxiety and trauma. If this is financially difficult, see a university for grad program therapy, or find a sliding scale therapist in your community.

That‚Äôs just the most basic step one. The real work is internal. This level of trauma is beyond ‚Äúselfish young person‚Äù categorization. Your mother actively hurts you and your parents don‚Äôt listen when you explain that you‚Äôre suffering. 

Once it gets to a point where parental visits cause mental health crises that take you to the doctor, you are no longer obligated to feel responsible for their mental health crises. Especially for a month, when half that time of a visit from her ended up with you needing medical intervention.

It‚Äôs time to get mental health help. With a specialist who can aide you with healthy boundaries. If you‚Äôre not comfortable saying straight up no to your family, at least manage your own time. She wants a month because the flight is long? Ok, it‚Äôs your flight though, you get to decide if the flight is long. You get to decide if a week is plenty and you don‚Äôt mind the travel. You get to decide where you stay when you‚Äôre there, even if it‚Äôs with an old friend and not family. You can start laying these small boundaries of your time and space even if you haven‚Äôt worked your way up to a no yet.

Also, a good technique I learned from /r/raisedbynarcissists is the gray rock approach. If she pries about your life or body, give her nothing to go on about. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gained so much weight!‚Äù ‚Äúok.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about your health!‚Äù ‚ÄúOk.‚Äù If she won‚Äôt listen when you tell her she‚Äôs hurting you, why give her any fodder to hurt you with more? You have a right to privacy even in her presence. This includes on the phone.

As for financial support, you get to decide how much you owe them or not. If they are literally putting you in the hospital, how much do you really owe them? Get to therapy, practice boundaries and communication, and if they still insist on damaging language, go low or no contact. They chose to have and support a child. You didn‚Äôt choose to be raised with abusive language.

This is a hard situation. I relate, I am no contact with an abusive dad with health issues. It‚Äôs a constant line I have to walk. I ended up no contact with him, but I know that‚Äôs not always right for everyone. With soul searching, therapy and anxiety management; you can learn what‚Äôs right for you. But whatever you choose, try not to feel guilty - they gave you life but it‚Äôs yours to live and feel and inhabit."
"""Thanks for the invitation.  Unfortunately, I have other commitments and won't be able to make it.""

Also, you are under no obligation to make any accomodations if she does attend your college."
"I know you don‚Äôt want to hear this, but based on the emails and random hidden STD screening, it sure sounds like she has physically cheated, and recently. People who have been married 15 years AND have been actively messaging other men sexually don‚Äôt just get a random testing. 


You need to talk to her about what you found, and the screening you also found. Ask to see the results, and ask her honestly if she‚Äôs been with someone else. Also, you seem to be severely minimizing the emotional cheating. That‚Äôs a huge breach of trust and love. Surely your wife talking to another guy in a sexual or romantic way isn‚Äôt just super easy for you to get past? She has breached your trust, lied to you, engaged in minimally intimate conversations with someone who is not you, and intended to keep hiding it from you."
"I dunno, it might be relationship ending worthy, he did a total ass move. If you can forgive him and not hold on to any jealousy and resentment then I guess stay with him, but if I were in your shoes I don‚Äôt think I could do it."
"This is hilarious. This is EXACTLY what he deserves, and really I think you are so cool here, in that you befriended the GF and didn't throw a fit about her age.

Your Dad is probably jealous, and it probably makes him feel old and left out, and a bit like an old creepy dude.  He sees the end is nigh - and is way insecure that the GF will realize that she wants to be around you and your friends, and people who have more in common, who don't have all the baggage he does, and break up with him.  Which most likely she will."
"Step back for a moment and ask yourself why this is your problem to solve?

There are places your sister can go. She can go to a shelter, for example. She can go beg your parents to put her in rehab. She can apply for section eight housing and work with a social worker to figure out her life.

You do not need to caretake her. She is adult and figuring out her life is HER job, not yours."
"&gt;I think it was a very unfair question to ask, because how am I supposed to pick between the love I lost and the love I found? I don't think I should have to. And the whole idea of ""whose table in Heaven are you going to sit at"" seems incredibly juvenile and stupid. 

It is an unfair question, absolutely. And you should express this to him (though I'd leave out the ""stupid"" and ""juvenile"" part). 

But, I think it may be worth cutting him some slack. He had a moment of insecurity and fear that your relationship with him doesn't measure up to what you had with your ex-husband. Certainly, that  is an unhealthy way to view the relationship. But everyone is prone to moments of insecurity and fear. He even said as much when he told you it was "" selfish and irrational and stupid"".

&gt; I don't want to choose between the two of them? 

He isn't really asking you to choose. This isn't an easy situation for you at all, but understand that is is also likely a very difficult situation for him to know that his GF still loves another man and that the memories you shared are going to always remain close to you. Healthy communication can help both of you work through this."
Maybe it's your sister who doesn't like you and not your late father.
"Question: do you two plan kids? If yes, when those kids arrive will your singing career end? Cause if he won't support it, it will be hard to impossible to keep going. Will he support you teaching them singing and performing? Does any of that matter to you?

Also, the vanishing confidence you have is something to be treated seriously. That is more then just simple disinterest in your passion. You are uninterested in programming I guess, but you are not making him ashamed of that. I would recommend to think about where it is comming from and tell and expect him to stop with put downs.

Imo, that is something he needs to deal with in himself. You need to learn to tell him to stop with put downs and do it consistently each time he passive aggresively let's you know he is ashamed."
"I don't think you're a jerk in this matter, at all. It sounds like you had a calm discussion about something that's been bothering you and she seemed receptive to it. 

What was the ""non-jerk"" thing to do? Wait until you grew resentful or bitter? Wait until you started having fantasies about stepping outside your marriage? 

You did the right thing. If it is a problem, it needs to be addressed. Nowhere in here did it sound like you demanded sex or pushed her to do something she didn't want to do. It sounds like you had a talk. 

Just relax and see what happens."
"Then you pay her back. You can always do that. And, if you want to pay her back two-fold, don't get involved with any more drug ass dead beat losers. Seeing your kid with people like this will stress you to an early grave."
"To add to this:

And I'd like to be a part of the baby's life as well.  I'm willing to help out where I can to help our family."
"I wish someone had told me this a long time ago, so I will share it with you now. This behaviour is not apart from all the wonderful parts of him. This hurtful behaviour is a part of him too. 

It sounds like he does not want to empathize and support you because you cannot please him during your period. 

I hope this is different then my past situation. My ex never grew up, and no amount of pleading for him to be a decent human being while I dealt with normal female cycles helped. 12 years wasted. Good luck."
"So you actually have a multifaceted career with stability and flexibility for life plans, when I first read the title I was imagining something like the international ballet circuit that made a normal life next to impossible. Your fiance literally has no leg to stand on beyond some kind of prejudice against anything that isn't a hard science or practical field."
"On top of what others have said, I've gathered that for some guys ""sexy"" is a very particular type of woman, and ""cute"" and ""pretty"" and ""beautiful"" etc. are other very particular types of women, and they can be sexually attracted to all of those. It doesn't quite compute with me, because when I say ""s/he is sexy"" I *mean* ""I am sexually attracted to them."" But, this has come up enough times on here that I get the idea this is A Thing. For some guys, ""sexy"" means more like ""has a particular type of figure/hair/makeup and acts vampy."" It doesn't necessarily mean he wants that more than he wants ""pretty."" His behavior toward you gives me the impression that he does find you sexually attractive, even if he doesn't sort you into the ""sexy"" category."
What are you doing to yourself? Cancel. This is insane that you're going to try to go hang out with these people at a time like this.
"1. It's normal to at least share some of the responsibilities for the household and childcare during evenings / weekends. Doesn't have to be 50/50, but flat out refusing to do anything is not a great showing from your husband.

2. Your cleaning habits seem excessive. You can (and probably should) cut back on that considerably. Bleaching the bathroom daily? Mopping every surface daily? Cleaning the kitchen twice per day? Yes, cleanliness is a good thing, but there's such a thing as overdoing it. Drop some of the cleaning routines and you'll find you've got a much more relaxing day, which won't leave you as tired at the end of it.

Ultimately, both a regular job and a stay-at-home-parent role are work. A lot of work. You both have reasons to be tired at the end of the day. But it's only fair to expect that both parties put in a similar amount of time. His work will bring money, yours will bring an organized home and happy kids. Both contributions are important. Evaluate how much time you're spending on work compared to your husband. If you're working non-stop on the house/kids all the time that he is at his job and then some more in evenings and weekends, then clearly the balance is off."
"&gt; I'm sure Penny will realize they are not compatible at some point and get out of there.

Exactly what the dad is worried about"
"Oh OP... I just went through this with my fiance. I needed to hear it. He told me it isn't about attraction, and it's true. I've been a variety of sizes while with him. I know that he loves me. He is concerned about my health and longevity, and honestly, I was already starting to feel the consequences of my actions. Everything started to hurt. I was sedentary. It was all depression all the time. I had basically stopped trying.

That being said, your fiance might actually understand, despite what you think. He clearly understands the health risks that are associated with obesity, including difficult pregnancies. He obviously loves you. He's worried about your future together.

You have two choices at this point. You can continue down the path you're on, or you can get healthy. I know it fucking sucks to hear that, but those are your options. We have to stop pretending that being obese is okay. It's not, and this is coming from someone who is also trying to no longer be obese. I believe in you, OP! We can do this!"
Have people not read the original post? OP‚Äôs gf lied over and over and over. And it‚Äôs mature for OP to be okay with that because apparently the gf just had no clue that lying in a relationship is not the way to handle situations?? And there is absolutely no way gf cheated with the ex when she spent the weekend with her and deliberately hid it from OP and only fessed up when caught? Sure we like to think the best of people and that people can change but this does not bode well. OP already had several of these exact same discussions with the gf and she kept lying and communicating with the ex behind OP‚Äôs back anyways. Doesn‚Äôt seem like anything has changed.
"I'm sorry you're going through this. I know how hard it can be. I had a very close friend who was in a similar situation. She had several mental health issues that she knew about, but she refused treatment for, because she was positive she could handle it on her own. She was constantly in crisis. Constantly quitting jobs, and going broke. Because of her untreated bipolar disorder, she would go on these insane spending sprees, and then would have no money for rent, and cry desperately to me for cash.

  


At first I was always there for her. I answered every call and text, because she was always so sad and in crisis. I helped her out with money, because she made me feel so guilty. What kind of friend would I be if I let her go homeless? How could I do that to a friend? I was racked with guilt.

  


  


It took me years to understand that I was part of the problem. I wasn't helping her at all. I was enabling her to continue to ignore her problems. Why would she get treatment for her mental health, when she had me to bail her out every time she had a crisis? Why would she keep a job, when she knew I would be there to give her rent money? Wipe a therapist, when she could call me up at 3 in the morning and have me drive an hour to her place to soothe her?

  


  


I'm not a trained professional. I'm not a qualified counselor. I was hurting much more than I was helping. I thought I was being a good friend. I was being a bad friend. I was enabling her lack of responsibility.

I set a boundary and explained to her that I couldn't do it anymore, and while I couldn't force her to see a counselor or therapist, I wouldn't be filling that role for her anymore, as it was affecting our relationship in a negative way. and I hope we could move forward as friends, focusing on good times, light conversation, fun events, and enjoying our friendship.

  


  


Well apparently, friendship wasn't what she wanted, as she flipped out on me and nuked the entire friendship. She called me a judgmental monster, all sorts of names, blah blah blah. All because I would not be her surrogate therapist. That tells me that she really wasn't as invested in our friendship as I was, she really just wanted the attention and money that I was giving her.

  


  


  


I had to search myself and asked why I stayed so invested in the Friendship for so long, even though I was being used. There's part of me that loves to be needed, and there's part of me that loves to be in control. Every time she called me in crisis, or beg me for money, I got to Dole out some wise advice and feel like I had a measure of control over her life, and it was so satisfying to me. I didn't know this on a conscious level, I just know that I felt like I was doing a Good Deed by giving my friend my worldly wisdom. It took a long time for me to realize that she didn't give a shit about my advice and wisdom. She just smiled and nodded along, and made me feel needed and smart, because that's what it took to get my money and attention. I have to admit, she was a bit of a genius. Manipulative people often are.

  


  


Your girlfriend won't get better as long as you enable her. Be firm on her seeking mental health treatment. You're not a trained counselor. You're doing more harm than good by taking her Panic calls."
"You guys are fundamentally incompatible. Of course this will drive you apart. There is zero way to reconcile her desire for a bio child with your vasectomy and childfree status.

Your relationship is over."
"Ok. Here's how to deal with it. You have to have a comeback. You can't just take it.  Next time they give you shit about washing bras, tell them yes. Then say I'm washing one tonight, want to come over and see one in real life for the first time. They'll respond with seeing one before. Then give them shit for spying on his mom getting undressed. Done."
Get a lock for your door and start making your plan to move out.
"&gt;He has been my biggest cheerleader and supporter.

I remember saying this almost verbatim to the therapist I was seeing before my divorce. She came back with, ""What does he do that's supportive?"" 

I drew a complete, utter fucking blank it was one of the most powerful moments of my life."
"This is who he is, and I think it's probably naive of you to think that anything you can do is going to make him change. 

You've asked him to change. He hasn't changed. 

This. Is. Who. He. Is. 

Maybe someday he'll grow and change, but he's not going to do that for you, and he's not going to do ti any time soon. 

Break up with him and move on with your life. 

You know that's what you have to do."
"This. I would also add that you should definitely not tell C. This might unintentionally out A, which I think would be a huge breach of trust and potentially ruin your friendship."
"This is a spot on observation. I had a similar ex that was a crisis only responder. He never cared about anybodies needs, he was so rude to everyone not just me and it was obvious his failings to everyone close to him. He wont value you even if you guya take a break and he sees his shortcomings. He will blame you for making him suffer for no reason because you came back. Leave and stay gone. He wont care about you as a person and if its similar to what I delt with, his friends already know what a shit person he is and are wondering why you're still there."
"I'm glad things are getting better for you, but I'm super concerned that your SO had to hear the truth from anyone but you in order to recognize the situation. Does he normally disregard your concerns?"
"It's okay to not feel like you are close to a relative because they are a bad person or have done bad things. 

My grandfather was a child molester who molested my aunt and several of my cousins throughout their childhoods, and thankfully my parents declined for me to have any contact with him when I was young. Many of my relatives lobbied to have my parents take my grandfather in to live with them when I was a young girl and my grandfather was an old unstable drunk incapable of living on his own. My parents again declined, creating a rift in the family. 

My father has a lot of complicated feelings about his side of the family and has forgiven many of them for his own reasons, but I don't feel a thing for them and can't forget that they tried pretty hard to have me and my sister molested for nothing more than their convenience. At social functions I am pleasant on the face of it, but I probably won't ever seek a deeper relationship there.

Your grandfather hurt someone you love, which is an even harder thing to forgive than harm to yourself. It's okay if you don't want to be close with him."
Absolutely never interact with this person further. They are not the type of person you want to be with.
"&gt;you don't know anything about traveling

"&gt; I still today, am so blurred on this - I can‚Äôt decide 100% if it was a just a creep saying anything to get into a teenagers pants

Don't wonder anymore. It was this 100%. As a 24 year old man, I saw 16 year olds as children. I'm willing to speak for my peers on that point as well."
"Lol and then here I am, with **literally** no friends and no life, and my boyfriend is loving and supportive and likes me the way I am. You can do better. Please do! You sound like a catch."
"It absolutely tears my heart to pieces to admit it. But in the past few weeks, I have had this exact thought. The thought of sitting in my own apartment, listening to my music with NO FEAR of criticism or judgment, knowing that if I make a money mistake, it's MY mistake (or better yet, PLANNING so that there ARE no money mistakes and I never have to be blindsided like this again.) 

I hate that the thought of my own little apartment gives me so much peace. I never wanted this. I love my husband so much."
"You ain't going to like this reply, but I do think it is probably over. She seems pretty sure on what she wants to do in her life now and she is letting you down gently instead. She has had a tough time in the past and she most likely not wanting to risk it again, and I can understand this. I would give her some space but realize there is a high chance that she won't come back. I will say this though, the more you push it on her the more it will fall apart. I would pretty much tell her you understand and to give you a call if you would want to give it another shot or to talk about it, and end it there. If she decides to call you great, if not, then there is plenty of other fish in the sea. 

  
The whole 'I do think it's unfair for her to do this to me without giving a chance' kind of makes my alarm bells go off, no offense. If you even have to say that, you probably need to let go and take this as a life lesson. Being clingy/needy won't work, it almost never does. I get you may think she is the only one right now, but you'll find someone else too if not her. You're still young."
He's forgiven you for what exactly? Being a child? Making him have responsibilities? You didn't do anything wrong. He has nothing to forgive you for. He brings nothing to your life and if you let him back in he will just cause more pain. Also he defiantly wants something from you.
"For the moment I‚Äôm just sitting downstairs trying to collect myself, but yes I‚Äôve absolutely had enough of feeling like this. I can‚Äôt imagine this being my future."
"I would keep it light for a while.  If it goes well, you can apologize.  

But there is something you must never ever do again.  You can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúpeacekeeper‚Äù.  You are fired.  Because, as you can see, you are no good at it.  Your brother cut you out with your mother for your ‚Äúpeacekeeping‚Äù. 

Don‚Äôt be your mom‚Äôs henchman anymore. If you want a relationship with your brother, have a relationship with your brother.  Don‚Äôt involve your mom. Don‚Äôt spend your time with him fighting her battles."
"I hate to say this, but I would not be surprised if your husband is cheating on you. It sounds like he's projecting hardcore. 

Either way, this is not healthy or normal."
"&gt; He got angry with me and said he will not be contacting me again since I don‚Äôt love him enough to wait.

It‚Äôs unrealistic &amp; unfair to expect a partner to wait indefinitely, without any schedule or assurances. If he had an attorney, a financial roadmap or budget for improving his credit score, whatever documentation he could work on at this time regarding the divorce... then that‚Äôs one thing. But asking you to wait based on promises &amp; hypotheticals that may never come to fruition is not fair to you. You‚Äôre being smart to walk away from this while you emotionally can."
"Your boyfriend sucks, and I would cut your losses if I were you. 

The more I read of your post, the less sympathetic towards him I became. The dealbreaker for me would be his tendency to try to turns things back around on you. Like, holy shit, he disappears from a party, then is disappointed that *you* didn't go look for him. This behavior is extremely immature at best, and downright manipulative at worse."
"Do not reply. Show Jack the messages in person and ask if they are an accurate reflection of his feelings, and if yes, let him know you would like to hear these things from him in the future, and if not, then that is between him and his girlfriend. Either way, make it clear his girlfriend is never to message you from his phone again. 

If he brushes it off, distance yourself from him. He's not worth the drama his girlfriend brings with him. I personally wouldn't hug him again just to avoid the shitshow, but if you want to hug him and he wants to hug you, go for it!"
"Check the property again.  It's likely either owned by an investor or by a bank.  If it's owned by an investor, contact them and tell them they have a squatter.  If it's owned by the bank, you can probably find their property section or who is in charge of the bank owned properties (it may be a local real estate agent) and tell them."
"Since no one else has mentioned it...

He‚Äôs 9 years older than you, and started dating you when he was 28 and you were 19. That‚Äôs a university-aged woman dating a grown-ass man. You guys were at totally different life stages when your relationship started (and still are, arguably). Also, there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs with someone so much younger than him, and it‚Äôs almost certainly because women his own age won‚Äôt put up with his bullshit. I‚Äôm willing to bet his ex before you was also much younger than him, right? 

None of this is to blame you at all, and good for you for realizing that this relationship is toxic and leaving him."
"My mom used to play the guitar and sing and my dad always made fun of her for it, and eventually she replaced music with alcohol. After the divorce she still never played. It's one of the biggest reasons I hate my dad. Don't be my mom, OP"
I come off maybe flippant in the post but I‚Äôm just in shock. I feel a year of my life has been taken from me and utterly wasted.
Your friend is disgusting and psycho. Your brother didn‚Äôt even know she was videotaping him. Who does that?! You absolutely cannot remain friends with someone like this.
"TREAD MILL. Yes. Run through the ringer. 

This is absolutely insane. OP says in her comments he controls when she can go to the PARK? [Watch me take my kids to the park, MF. Watch me walking away.]

The scariest thing about this to me is she has met all his expectations. And now there are more. And will ALWAYS be more. The blinds, the knickknacks...next it will be towels and canned goods. Fuuuudge--getting flashbacks from *Sleeping with the Enemy*. 

OP, this is unbalanced, abusive, and frankly, stupid. What he is asking for is STUPID. But he knows that. He wants to keep you dancing on hot coals. 

Don't your feet hurt?"
"Any relationship where one partner ""punishes"" the other is not a healthy one. Who the fuck is he to punish you?"
"&gt;she's much better with food.

I hear this a lot: ""she's better at the house-stuff.""  ""she's a better cook.""  ""she likes doing this stuff.""  Honestly, ""she's"" better at this kind of stuff because she's had more practice because if she didn't do it, it wouldn't get done.  Coming from someone who is the better cook, sometimes I just want to fuck off on my phone while food gets made for me.  I'm better because I do it more.  

&amp;#x200B;

And this is more relationship dependent, I've heard of men getting stuck with certain duties (including cooking) because ""they are better at it""."
"Wow, this is amazing advice, thank you so so much for it. 

I have already reached out to Brown's office of financial aid and explained the situation to them. They haven't responded to my email yet, probably because I sent it over the weekend but I plan on calling first thing tomorrow too. I doubt they will be willing to give out more aid, but I may be able to do a work study program or receive a grant. I've also talked with my school already about potential scholarships that have late deadlines and I plan on applying to some. 

I'm also meeting with a local lawyer on Wednesday about the money situation so hopefully that can be sorted out. 

And I will definitely be taking over the health aspect of it. I just had my boyfriend do some research into local clinics for me since I was so exhausted dealing with my parents. 

Oh yes, I definitely changed all of my passwords. There's no need for them to ever have access to my private accounts after this."
"There is no amount of closure or revenge that will actually make you feel better. And he doesn't seem to honestly care about you, so what kind of revenge could you ever get? 

Dump him. Leave and never look back. Be happy, love your life, and forget about this asshole. He isn't worth another single second. Life is too short. 

I'm sorry anyone would treat you like that. It is completely detestable what he did to you. You are worth so much more. Please find a way to just move on, cut your losses and just focus on making yourself happy."
"A big part of marriage is being able to have open and honest conversations about important topics. Your health and the health of your future child (children) are extremely important topics. Sure, there were nicer ways that he could have phrased what he said (not that it was particularly rude or anything but maybe a bit blunt), but ultimately his underlying message is that he cares about you and he cares about his future family and he wants to make sure everyone has the best chance of being healthy and happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds like you understand the risks of being pregnant and overweight and have plans to manage these risks, so now the important part is swallowing your pride and hurt and self-consciousness a bit and having an open conversation about your future pregnancy and health plans. Is your SO struggling with weight as well? If so, this could be a very relationship-strengthening moment as you both work towards improving your health and starting a family."
"I'm really sorry about your dad. You always hear about these things and obviously it's sad but you don't truly understand until it happens to you. Im sure you know what I mean when I say my dad took a peice of me with him when he left us. As much as I want too I can't change the fact that my dad is gone now, but I do have control of my own life. My dad lives on in in my siblings and I. I have to make it count for him. 

Your dad lives on in you too. Its hard not to think about the reasons he's gone but try to remember the reasons that he lived. If you ever need to talk to anyone you can always message me."
"Your husband is not going to change and now that he knows you‚Äôll basically do whatever he says it‚Äôll get worse. 

I‚Äôve been a stay at home mom for 17 years. I don‚Äôt tell him how to do his job and he doesn‚Äôt try to tell me how to do mine. 

Maybe leave him alone with the kids for a weekend. He‚Äôll either see the light or you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs time to leave his selfish ass."
"He sounds like a real winner - no job, no ambition, no work ethic, no money, no ethics, and you're worried you'll upset him or make him angry when you expect him to be a responsible adult"
"Tell her what you said here. You. Or the dogs and cats.

It can‚Äôt continue.

Feel better."
"You should end this relationship.

It's toxic, and he's verbally abusive.

He's also been threatening to end the relationship already -- that's usually a good sign that you should just leave already.

Also, never ""take it on yourself"" again to reach out to the other woman and stir up shit. That will never be wise or respectful of anyone involved. If you ever had the idea in your head to do something like that again -- just end the relationship instead. Nothing you did excuses him for a second, but you have fallen pretty deep into the toxicity of this relationship as well. Get out before you do serious damage to your own ability to be in a healthy and respectful relationship. Go be better with someone who also behaves better."
A study abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that you will likely never get again. This would be absolutely unforgivable in my eyes.
"Have you guys tried couples counselling? I would be very careful about moving to an open relationship. They come with their own problems, and could destroy your marriage if you're not careful. A therapist might be able to offer alternatives or at least get you two on the same page and set ground rules before you open up the marriage."
No one his age will date him because they are more confident and have more respect for themselves
"Dude, your bf sounds crazy. Who harasses their partner into jealousy? Seriously? He tells you that you should be jealous. He calls another girl hot. He bothers you until you follow this girl on Instagram. 

Your bf sounds unhinged. There's gotta be more red flags than this, but even if there isn't, this is big enough to rethink the relationship entirely.

Sounds like he wants you to leave him so he blame you and your ""jealousy"" instead of himself."
"OP, you do not have to be a part of this. You can and should remove yourself from the situation. 

""In light of recent discoveries, I am no longer comfortable spending time with you two."" Then treat yourself all weekend with fun, solo activities to take your mind off things. I'm sorry you're going through this."
"Not to mention, having a friend who recognizes her worth and values her may boost her self-esteem.  If Dad is used to preying on people who don't have their shit together, this is a threat to his method."
"If your parents, who conceived, gave birth to, and raised their daughter are no longer willing to bail her out of jail, then I officially absolve you, my son, from feeling responsible for it yourself.  Go in peace.

Alternatively, if the guilt is truly something that you cannot rationalize away, then by all means bail her out, house her, and support her.  No faster way to add your name to the list of people too badly burned by this woman to ever consider helping her again than doing that.  It would be a lot less painful if you took the cue from the people running away from the burning building instead of rushing in yourself to see just how hot it is, though..."
Sometimes the universe throws you a lifeline. This is yours. Grab the damn thing and don't let go.
"Tell your lawyer (and _only_ your lawyer, do NOT tell the internet) absolutely **every detail** about the situation. Mention exact documents that were stolen or destroyed; make an exact and exhaustive list of property destroyed; mention **Every Single Detail** about the eviction process.

Remember that you were NOT ""kicked out"". You are an adult: you were illegally evicted. Your parents were acting as your landlords and _you had tenancy rights, that they violated_. Tenancy is a lot more complicated than people think, and under many circumstances (that you almost certainly met) tenancy is automatic under law. It doesn't require a written lease. 

No matter how trivial, **tell your lawyer everything.** You need to get granular as _fuck_. Every single detail is vital. Anything you forget to tell them because you ""didn't think it was relevant"", who knows, maybe it is maybe it isn't but _your lawyer will know better than you do_, so tell them EVERYTHING and let THEM decide if it's worth considering for legal action. Do not go ""well I don't want to waste their time"" - you are a client paying for a service, their JOB is to spend their time on you."
"&gt; And I really do wish I could cut down the amount I clean but it‚Äôs literally what my husband tells me to do everyday and he goes round and checks when he gets home.

OP...this is NOT healthy and borderline abusive. You're not his maid, you're his WIFE. You need to stand up for yourself and TELL your husband that you are not a cleaning service. It's reasonable to expect the house to be relatively clean, but inspections to check you cleaned every nook and cranny?? That's literally insane. What does he do if the house is *not* meeting his ridiculous expectations...?"
"Unfortunately, at this point there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it, the cat is out the bag. Too me, whenever someone starts revealing secrets about a recent ex, it doesn‚Äôt make the ex look bad, it makes the secret teller just seem bitter and untrustworthy, like if we got in an argument, would they tell everyone my secrets too? A foot fetish is not that shocking either. 

I think you did the right thing by ‚Äúowning‚Äù it, instead of denying it. If your just like ‚Äúyeah, and?‚Äù, it‚Äôs not really gossip anymore, and not entertaining anymore for people to talk about behind your back. This happened with a friend of mine a few years ago. Somehow the gossip was spread that he like transgendered females (shocking back then to some), and instead of denying it, he was like ‚Äúyup... so?!?? Anything else about my sex life you wanna know since you‚Äôre really into it?‚Äù to people who mentioned it. It was said with no malice, wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic, just super normal. Worked like a charm and that quickly faded from the gossip mill."

Cut all this toxicity out of your life. ASAP. Your husband gives zero fucks about you. None."
"Yikes, what a nightmare! I have three pieces of advice:

1. Tell your wife that you are going to handle this bc it's your parents, and you have her back 
2. Clearly communicate in writing to your parents that your child is going to daycare, NOT to their home, and this is not up for discussion. They can see the baby when you choose to invite them over. You are the parents and your decisions are final.
3. Establish boundaries (discuss them with your wife) and let your parents know there will be consequences like reduced contact with you if they violate those boundaries."
"You said you didn‚Äôt know what that involved and the went on to explain, in detail, exactly what the problem is. You did the same thing in your post. You know everything she has been doing alone, you (now) know she isn‚Äôt OK with doing it alone. There‚Äôs no question left in your question. Your GF has clearly communicated to issue, you do understand, act accordingly."
"Girl, you are in a relationship. Tell him and share the burden. You can support each other in this.

I wish you well. Hopefully the results come back negative and this will just be a scare."
"When you have this discussion with her, focus on priorities. What are MUSTS and what are WOULD BE NICES? My fianc√© and I have a very limited budget, and while I would have liked a $3k wedding dress, having amazing food and an open bar was a bigger priority. If you assure her that her MUSTS won‚Äôt be ignored, her WOULD BE NICES will be easier to say goodbye to."
"Ok listen up, Mr Adult, from a fellow adult around your age who fell for this, sadly, not too long ago. 

I'm not a perfect adult. There's dishes in my sink right now that could probably be washed. I've occasionally paid a bill late (by a few days) because I was going to take care of it ""tomorrow"" and then didn't. I hate dusting, but I don't actually mind laundry. 

But I dated this dude we'll call Mike. Mike was (to me) crazy handsome, incredibly intelligent, a comfortable presence to be around, funny, etc etc. A real catch.

But. There's always a but, yanno? 

He got laid off from a job. Ok, shit happens. He had been making a fucking killing. Like nearly 6 figures. 

Imagine my surprise when I found out *we. were. fucking. broke*. Like how the hell are we broke? Not that I expected him to carry me, we split shit down the middle and I did ok, but when disaster strikes you expect someone making 80-90k a year for the last 9 years to have some savings. He didn't. 

He had pissed it all away on conventions, clubs, expensive clothing. He lived paycheck to paycheck. 

He decided he didn't need to pay his car registration. Or his insurance. Got his car impounded. *With my fucking cat in it on the way back from the vet*. No, they didn't impound the cat too, thankfully. But honestly it was a nightmare to go get him because he freaked and hid under the seat (dumbass had taken him out of his carrier because of course he did). Then he bolted out of my arms and ran across the impound lot, which just so happened to be RIGHT next to the freeway and so help me sweet baby rollerblading Jesus if anything had happened to that cat I'd have impounded Mike's nuts. 

He also ""couldn't"" find a job. I finally looked at his resume because god damn the phone should have been ringing off the hook. It read like this (only in the IT world, I'm just making up examples): 

1. McDonalds - Helped customers

2. Walmart - Stocked

3. Farmer's Bank - Teller

4. Pizza Dudes - Delivery

HIS FUCKING RESUME WAS A LIST. It wasn't even a CV. He was god damned smarter than that, he just couldn't be fucked to write a real resume. 

Anytime I asked him to do a chore, he ""didn't know how"". Can you please clean the bathroom while I'm at work? Why didn't you clean the bathroom like I asked? ""I don't know how"". Laundry. Don't know how. Sweep the god damned floor. Don't know how. If this had actually been the case, which it was not because no 40 year old man of normal intellect doesn't know how to sweep a floor, there were any number of ways he could have LEARNED how. He just didn't feel like it. 

And then. THEN. One day I come home and there's no power. I should have put it together but I didn't. I went through our stack of bills to find the account number to call the power company. I find two things:

* It's shut off for non payment. 

* We are on day 40 of a 60 day notice of eviction for non payment of rent. HE NEVER EVEN TOLD ME WE WERE BEING EVICTED. 

I. Was. Livid. Beyond livid. He was just going to let my shit and *my 2 cats which are living beings who need care* get locked in the apartment - mind you I would just come home and discover this - and move in with his brother. 

And guess why this happened? Because his ""close loving family"" had enabled him his entire life. 

My credit was trashed. I mean TRASHED. My name was on the bills and the lease. I needed a cosigner to get an apartment. I lived in a cheap shitty studio in a bad neighborhood for 2 years trying to get my shit back together. 

This is your future."
"Since no one has mentioned it... STD testing for you.

Oh, and leave, immediately."
"And in the comments, OP said he wants the house to look like a 'show room'. It seems like he doesn't want the house to remind him that he has kids. Kids are messy, and dirty, and smelly. They leave a noticeable impact on a house every day. It's absolutely insane that he expects the house to be spotless and bleached every single day."
"Financial abuse, emotional abuse, digging you in deeper and while you're getting a clue, he's still not making a change. 

Move out, get that divorce and get some gear that makes you feel pretty and decent again. You're not treated well by this man and you keep trying to rescue something that's not worth rescuing. Every day you stay longer, is one day wasted, one day you're further sinking in debt. He now has a lure: therapy. How long is he going to drag that out before you'll realise he's still not going to do any work? It's not a way to improvement, it's a weapon. Get away."
Look. Nobody needs to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù you to have kids. You either want them or you don‚Äôt. And same for her: she doesn‚Äôt have to provide you with ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù reasons for her to want kids; she just wants them. And that is a big enough incompatibility for you to break up.
"Wow I'm so sorry, that's unbelievable. I'm glad you have a safe place to stay. 

It's only been three days, and you have a lot of time to sort this out. It's possible that your parents are acting out of anger and will cool down in a week or two. Even if they don't, you have time to explore different options. I hope you can take some days to recover emotionally from a situation that's hard for me to even imagine.

A few thoughts for you to consider

* If your parents hold firm on the no contact, you probably want to get in touch with Brown's financial aid department. In general your family's income is included for financial aid purposes but they may be able to help you figure out student loans or other options. They also may be able to connect you with legal assistance.
* Check out resources in your community for domestic violence and homeless youth. They may be able to help you get connected with counseling and legal advice.
* If your yearly tuition is $15,000 that's presumably spread out over the year. And you'll hopefully be able to work and save some money this summer. Even if the money that your mom currently has control over is hard to access, you may be able to come up with the rest. Does the $15,000 include room and board? If not, you may need to figure out a way to get access to the money you inherited (which is legally yours).
* Worst case, you may be able to change your financial aid status so that you are an ""independent student"" rather than a dependent on your parents. You will probably need help from Brown's financial aid office to do this and it might involve taking some time off (they sometimes need to document that you're supporting yourself independently). Usually colleges will allow you to defer your admission for a year. I know this is probably not your first choice, but if you need to you can likely find an internship or entry-level work doing something interesting and supporting yourself for a while to establish independence. 

I wish I had better suggestions for you but hopefully this will be enough to go on. Sometimes just making a plan can help a lot--Brown's financial aid department will probably help here. 

Finally, you sound so stable and mature but I think it still needs to be said. You are not a prostitute or a whore, and making the adult decision to have sex certainly doesn't mean that no ""good boy"" will ever want to marry you. Nor does getting an abortion. It is completely normal that you feel devastated and alone. I'm devastated on your behalf.  

I know this is very raw right now, but I hope that at some point there are friends or other family members in your life you will feel comfortable sharing this with. It truly does not reflect poorly on you, and building a support network going forwards is very important, whatever ends up happening with your parents. Of course I also understand wanting to keep it private for the time being."

"Had a gf who was super jealous.

"I wouldn't let him use your car at all if he can't take care of it, maybe he shouldn't pay insurance, but he should pay for gas, oil changes, and other driving related expenses (Especially if he uses it a lot.)


However when it comes down to it, it's your car, you shouldn't have to ride bicycles in the rain either.

He could sell his cycle and save for a car."
"You shouldn't be getting a divorce to 'punish' him.  You should be choosing divorce because it's the best choice for you (and to some degree, your children).  

Sometimes when people hurt us, they use up the benevolence we have in our heart for them.  Many times, once it's gone, it's gone.  

Make sure if you divorce, it's for the right reasons for you.  Explore that in therapy."
"Honestly? Get off social media for awhile, since I'm assuming that's how you found out? 

When my ex got engaged to the woman he cheated on me with about a year after we broke up, despite me being over him and dating again, it brought up all those feelings of rejection, anger, and general self-loathing, like I was not good enough. Although those feelings were completely irrational because, deep down, I knew I was a better person than him, the human brain is complex and we can feel things we do not want to feel and do not believe we should be feeling.

Focus on your current relationship and take a break from Facebook, Instragram, etc... It will probably do your mental health wonders."
"He wants to take the easy way.  

No.   Ugh.  I wish I knew how to make the text striked through.  

He doesn't want to take the easy way.  He wants *you* to take the easy way *for* him, which is even lazier than him doing it himself.  

Your boyfriend doesn't have the ambition that you have OP.  Are you certain he's a good match for you?"
"Yeah right? OP is acting like everything is all fine now. She doesn't realise it was her fiance massively disrespecting her in the first place by letting this woman into their lives and then turning up the TV or his games whenever she tried to discuss it with him.

Like great. Have a good time running to people outside your relationship (his mother, us) every time you have an issue because he won't listen to you. Sounds like a fun life."
"This! There's a difference between being chill and being completely apathetic. OP, you sound like the latter. Not initiating conversations, sex, or dates with your girlfriend is going to make her feel unloved because you aren't bothering to make any effort for her. You're just existing alongside her."
"Here's an alternative future: some years down the road from today, you're sipping your favorite cold drink of choice over brunch with a close female friend, and you'll say, ""Did I ever tell you about that absolute a**hole I dated in my early 20's? Thank god I got out of that!"".

I know it hurts like hell right now but you really should leave him. You're gonna learn from this. You're going to learn to ask for more in relationships, to not settle for somebody who makes you paranoid, who doesn't even apologize for jumping on dating apps for an ego boost! You are gonna learn you are worth more, because you are worth more. You will re-build your self-esteem."
"how much he should contribute aside, I would be alarmed that he doesn‚Äôt OFFER to pay more, OFFER to fix the car, and wow, the part about him parking the car in an area that needed to be moved early and refusing to move it?

"&gt;how will I tell our kid one day that his college was paid by strangers wanking to his mum?

Why would your child need to know that?  Come on, man, think.  Your kid never needs to know anything about their parents sex lives.  Telling the kid that would just be cruel to your child and your wife."
"So I don‚Äôt have kids yet, but I have noticed within my office how different the social expectations are for moms &amp; dads. If a dad packs his kid‚Äôs lunch or takes a half day to go to his kid‚Äôs talent show, he‚Äôs an awesome dad. Like the social expectations are so ridiculously low that actively participating in raising your own kid is applauded. But it‚Äôs not the same for moms. I‚Äôm wondering if this sort of social construct is what is getting to your wife - that expectations for moms are just totally different. People will judge her if she chooses to return to her career, if she takes time out for her own hobbies or mental health, etc, whereas you won‚Äôt have that same experience. 

I think the best thing you can do for now is to prove to her that you‚Äôre a team. Saying it is nice, but you can really prove it to her by taking on 50% of the responsibilities in your home &amp; your lives. Having confidence &amp; experience that you‚Äôre a team can give her confidence that you‚Äôll be there to do half of the parenting. Also, it might help to talk about what each of you envisions for parenting. If your families focus solely on raising children, she may feel pressure to parent that same way. So talking about how you would do things differently may help there."

"&gt; Me and the children will still be eating

Honestly this struck me as the most telling. He gets up and leaves the table while the rest of the family is still eating? This man is completely self-centered. The *least* he could do is stand there and rinse off the dishes while having a conversation with all of you while the rest of you are finishing your dinners. Family dinners are usually some of the most quality time that a family gets during the weekday, and the fact that he gets up and leaves the table before everybody is done eating shows how self-centered he is."
"Problem one: Your boyfriend doesn't respect your boundaries to begin with. I told my husband once that I don't like being tickled, and it's been 10 fucking years now and he has never done it again. That is how that is supposed to work.

Problem two: He has so little respect for the words coming out of your mouth, that he put you in a vulnerable physical position where you could only defend yourself by biting. And even still, with warning, he didn't listen or take your seriously. 

Problem three: He thinks you ""deserve"" to be slapped.

Solution: Get rid of the asshole who thinks you *deserve* to be treated in this way and that he *deserves* to do it to you against your will and without your consent."

Are you sure it's not because of the newness and/or the whole ""falling for someone else thing""? Lots of people tend to lose attraction to other people when they fall for someone, mainly due to the early infatuation. Are there other women that interest you? Does the prospect of having sex with a woman (other than her) make you feel the same as having sex with your husband?"
Especially consider she's a child psychologist. I think she'll be *very* understanding of the idea that OP doesn't share her mother's views.
"You‚Äôve done a fantastic job of describing this behavior and as a female, I can recognize it very clearly and unfortunately as behavior I‚Äôve fallen victim to myself in the past, only my swooper(s) were senior colleagues. The difference is in my experience they also ingratiated themselves to the men in the extended social circle, in a very buddy buddy sort of way. My stomach lurches just thinking about it.

Therein likely lies your approach - you could try lightly mentioning to your gf that it‚Äôs a shame he doesn‚Äôt seem as friendly to you and focus on that part - you and she together on the same side of the issue, which is that you want to be friends with zany fun guy and he seems so inexplicably not ok with that. 

You don‚Äôt mention any of the girls actually go for him - does he have any track record of success with this crap?"
It's like he's negging her and doing it clumsily to boot. This guy sounds like a loser.
"What did your husband say when you told him you wouldn't be going to the wedding?

His secretive behaviour and lies would be my primary concern to be honest. You need to ask him why he has been consistently lying to you!

You can't make a decision about separation until you have that conversation."

"As someone who spent three last year caring for someone who had a rare brain disease, you're wife is so unbelievably right and you have no idea what you're getting into.

Brain disease is not at all like other disease. I assure you that it is some of the most expensive medical problems you can have. He will have to have high resolution MRIs and scans with contrast. Even covered with federally provided health care you will still be responsible for 20% which will be $3-6k a pop. This will happen at the very least monthly. God forbid if they have to do surgery, your part of that, after insurance, will be six figures. That's just some of the financial cost. Forget all the medical assistive devices and such you will need.

Now on to the health care. No human being is equipped to do this in house. Myself, a paid caretaker, and an entire hospice team provided this to my mother. I too had a work at home career and had to quit because she needed 24 hour supervision and refused to spend her last months in a facility. Brain stuff always leads to seizures. That won't always be jerking around. It could be blacking out, hallucinations, sudden fits of violence, urinating or defecating on herself. She would be fine walking around one moment then she would just fall. 

Getting a fully grown human off the floor without injuring them when you are alone is a feat. And you have to pray they don't have a violent seizure or hallucinate. She ripped both my arms out of the shoulder socket and injured my back so badly I can barely lift 10 lbs and have to do physical therapy now.

Her lack of control over her bodily functions lead to us having to rip the carpet out. You may say ""well, why wasn't she in diapers?"" Well when you are fine for 10 days then all the sudden you're walking around peeing and pooing everywhere like a excretion zombie then you're fine again it's hard to rationalize that you did that or that you need diapers. So we couldnt get her to keep them on. 

She said the most unbelievably cruel things when her brain wasn't working properly and facts got all jumbled in her head and she had no idea who to trust. 

Other types of seizure impacted different bodily functions. Like she would be fine and talking, walking, all normal then suddenly lose control over her throat and mucus and salavia is building up and she is suffocating and clawing her face off and you are trying to fight her hands away and stick a medicine syringe down her throat to bail her airway out so you can breathe. Or you will see her shifting in her sleep on the nanny cam and by the time you rush in there she has clawed a hole in her back while asleep without waking.

Then on top of everything else you are dealing with you have open wounds that won't heal properly because the brain has the entire body out of whack.

This is my mother. And I am traumatized waking up screaming from horrific nightmares of these events every night and having to go through therapy and physical therapy to recover and you want to expose your wife and children to this.

I don't know how rich you are, but I want to reiterate that brain disease is as expensive as it gets and you can kiss goodbye your retirement ot your kids graduation funds. And keep in mind if you have a mortgage and he lists your house as an address the hospitals can put a lein on your home.

Seriously. Read up on stuff. It doesn't seem like you are too familiar with brain disease but I wouldn't wish that on anyone. My own, able bodied, father noped out on my mother's care. That's her husband of 50 years. Cmon'"
"No is a complete sentence.

&gt;He asks, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to give some to (roommate‚Äôs name)?‚Äù

No

&gt;He tells me to buy something for his roommates.

No - or tell him to buy it himself or tell him to give you money to buy it.

No

&gt;I was planning on talking to him about it soon but am afraid it would come off the wrong way.

You are only a couple months into this relationship.   This is absolutely the time that you have this conversation and deal with it even if it comes across wrong.   Don't waste your time in relationships that aren't right for you."
"You are both living at home and talking about a 20K ring?   IMHO, that just shows that neither one of you has any realistic ideas about finances in general and marital finances in particular.

"So some people are already recommending that you reach out to DV shelters, go to counseling, etc.


But I haven't seen anybody tell you WHY this is so concerning. There are two times in a women's life when domestic violence can PEAK: one, when she tries to leave an abuser, and two, when she's pregnant.

Have you noticed that every time you go to your OB s/he asks if you're feeling unsafe at home, etc, etc? This is why. 

Pregnancy detonates a lot of issues and one of them is partner abuse. As if carrying twins in a high risk, don't move except for a 10 minute walk wasn't enough. Sigh. 

So here's where you have to get extra vigilant. You can begin a conversation trying him you've been thinking about something he said, ""keep the babies."" Why did he say that? Does he mean it? Is he already thinking about leaving before they're even here? Does he know how much that hurts to hear? How that goes against the trust in the relationship? And friend, you're not looking for any answer in particular. You're looking to see if he's self aware enough to give you straight answers. You're looking to see how he reacts to being called out. 

If his answers are anything less than ""wow I hadn't noticed.... Yeah I can see that...I don't know why I said it, I'm super scared blah blah..."" you need to start thinking about your future. Pregnancy is NO joke, but I gotta level with you. Pregnancy is nothing (relatively) compared to that first year. You both might be under a LOT of stress right now, but right now it's just you. When those two babies come out the stress levels will rise exponentially and it won't let up for MONTHS. 

There's the 'recuperating from childbirth' while the demands of breastfeeding increase, and you will be getting very, very little sleep. Twins, unfortunately, do not really sleep at the same time. One is awake, one is asleep. So you know how everyone says ""sleep when the baby is sleeping?"" That will be HARD for you. And him. 

What you need to do, really need to do, is set up a whole network of people whom you can count on for those first few months in case your idiot husband does not rise to the occasion or he continues down this idiotic ""keep your babies"" path. You need people who will feed you, people who will watch them, people who will help you. Post partum doulas, friends, family, mom groups, NOW is the time to think about all of these things and set it up. 

Good luck momma."
Oh god. Run from this guy this this is not healthy healthy. I was in a situation like this and you are being used.
"&gt; On the other hand, if he stays, they'll be watching him to make sure he never does this again

No, they won't. They will watch him as much as it is necessary to protect the company. Frankly, if you do not push for dismissal, you are essentially telling them that it wasn't that bad. That isn't good for you nor is it good for his next 'favorite girl'

This guy is a creep and a predator. He needs to be fired. For the good of everyone that is working with you, he needs to be fired. As for him doing this elsewhere. The industry is very small. Getting fired over sexual harassment will make others wary of hiring him."
"First of all, he is a creep. Second of all it was not your responsibility to stop him from doing this to someone else. He is the only one responsible for what he does. You were absolutely a victim of grooming and sexual abuse and none of it was your fault. 
If you are comfortable sharing your story, you can speak with the administration of the school he is working at and tell them about your experience. 
I would suggest getting counseling and making sure that you have support in place for yourself. 

He was a predator. He is responsible for any future predatory behavior. You were 16. 16!!!!! Of course it was and continues to be confusing for you.

"Read ""Why Does He Do That"" by Lundy Bancroft. Do not go to counselling with an emotional abuser. The book goes into a lot of detail as to why. You can't talk an abuser out of being abusive. You need to leave."
"Be sure to discuss everything you mentioned in your post with your lawyer, including the eviction, destruction of property, threats, in addition to the obvious money in an account controlled by your mother. A lot of what they did was straight up illegal and you‚Äôre likely entitled to damages.

Save all the text messages, write down everything you can remember with dates and times.

"I'm not a stay-at-home mum but I've been in a similar situation for the past three years. I moved in with my BF and ended up doing all the home work while working full-time. He also told me how  to do things in a certain way (how I should clean the kitchen, fold the laundry,...) and yelled at me when I did something ""wrong, although he was at home all day (he was a student and did not go to work - but his studies didn't go well and so he was at home most of the time). I also did all the purchases alone. He wouldn't even help me carry the bags in our apartment. I left him 5 months ago because I was so unhappy that I hurt myself. 

The more I did what he asked for the less respect I got (that's just my experience). I think it is your decision how you do the work. If that's not good enough for him he should do it by himself. I think he should also support you when he is at home.

Your relationship should be more important than homework. His behavior shows (in my opinion) that such unimportant things are more important than your feelings. You deserve better. Talk to him about your feelings and ask for more support or just the do the homework your way."
people think about all sorts of things/scenarios/other people when they‚Äôre having sex. i think the weird thing is that he TOLD you he had been thinking of her. thats fucking weird and would be a huge boner killer for me. shows really poor judgement on his part.
"&gt;Does anyone know how to stop his words from stinging me so hard?

Yeah, you kick the little sh!t out of your life. He's not a nice person"
"Woof.

Once is a fluke. Twice is mildly yikes. Three times with the same girl‚Äôs name? That‚Äôs a pattern. Put that pattern next to the amount of time he spends with her without you present and you‚Äôve got yourself a full-blown crush. 

He‚Äôs definitely into her. And his complete dismissal of your concerns is gross. The least he could do is own it, and discuss boundaries that could help you feel more secure in his fidelity. He‚Äôs choosing instead to turn it around on you and make you feel like the asshole here. I can‚Äôt speak on what this girl is feeling, but he at least is *very* motivated to make sure he doesn‚Äôt have to change a scrap of his behavior or take you seriously (poems are not boundaries). And that‚Äôs what will ultimately kill your trust in him. 

Up to you, but I think your relationship is on life-support. You can limp along for a while if you want but the damage is done."
"Just FYI, him wanting a baby isn't an indicator that you're not good enough or that he wants a baby *instead* of you.

Having a really small child is a totally different experience from having an older child. He can want both."
"I told him never to call me again. He‚Äôs already been blocked on everything. I do feel guilt and sadness that he threw away our friendship, but i was and am so disgusted by his words that I could never look my girlfriend in the eye if I continued to be mates with him."
"I guess I can say that years ago, I started a business, and he stood by me. But honestly, he was less than enthusiastic, and now that I look back, he wasn't really a cheerleader, he just didn't give me much shit about it. 

He more or less lets me do my own thing, I guess, which I like. Unless it's spending money. 

As I read this, it seems extremely pathetic."
"RED FLAG CITY

"I think most older guys dating women so young want a level of control and try to isolate their girlfriends.

Fortunately, he can't isolate her from someone living in the same house and he can't claim like he doesn't trust her friends because that friend is his own daughter.

"&gt;some kind of prejudice against anything that isn't a hard science or practical field.

"Hi, OP. I‚Äôm going to give you advice that‚Äôs a bit different than some of the other commenters, but I hope this is helpful to you. 

I work with incarcerated folks and have worked with numerous individuals (men and women) who are serving life sentences for murder. I know this is really difficult and complicated, and it sounds like it‚Äôs torn your family and other families apart. I think you should only go if you‚Äôre ready. Have you ever talked to a therapist or counselor, or reached out to support groups for people whose family members are incarcerated? I know it can feel like a unique burden that is hard to share with the world. Reading your post, it sounds like you are still struggling to understand how your brother ended up becoming the person he did. Someones it helps to talk to others who have been in the same place. 

On to your main question: do you actually want to see your brother? You don‚Äôt have to force yourself to if you aren‚Äôt ready, either - you could always start with writing to him, or talking over the phone. You have your whole life to visit him. That said, *if* you decide to visit him, you also don‚Äôt have to justify it to anyone. Visiting someone in prison doesn‚Äôt mean you approve of what he did. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt hate what he did. It doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person for wanting to see a family member - it just makes you human, and humans are complicated. At the end of the day, your brother is a human, you are human, and *it‚Äôs ok* if you want to see your family member. It doesn‚Äôt make you a terrible person. 

If you do visit him: you should be prepared. I‚Äôm not sure whether you‚Äôve been to a prison before - they‚Äôre a bit different than jails. They have certain dress requirements, but they can also be really difficult to visit, emotionally. If you go during visiting hours, there will be lots of people there visiting their loved ones - their fathers, sons, brothers and friends. It can be emotional. It‚Äôs possible that your brother won‚Äôt have contact visits and you will have to talk to him through a screen. 

As for conversation: do you know much about what he‚Äôs been up to? Has he adjusted to prison? (Does anyone in your family talk to him?) I ask because manh people serving life sentences spend significant amounts of time on suicide watch and in the mental health unit when they first arrive. That can shape the conversation you have. If you decide to go, I would look up the visiting hours ahead of time, and maybe call the prison to make sure your brother has contact visits.

It is possible that your brother has adjusted and will want to talk to you or your family, but is waiting until you guys are ready. Starting conversations can be hard. A simple ‚Äúhi‚Äù is a good place to start, maybe ‚Äúhow are you doing.‚Äù Your brother likely will feel ashamed that you‚Äôre seeing him there. He might talk about his life or his regrets. If keeping the conversation is what you need to do emotionally, that‚Äôs ok!! Do what you need to do to be ok. On the other hand, if you need to tell him how you feel - how much his actions affected you all, or how much you hate what he did - that‚Äôs ok, too. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily go in just so you can tell him you hate him. He knows that you hate what he did. If you see him, it should be because you want to - not because you feel like you have an obligation to condemn him in person. (I know this is complicated - it‚Äôs why writing a letter might be a good first step if you‚Äôre still passing through your feelings).

I know this was a lot. I‚Äôm sorry this is such a difficult topic. OP, feel free to PM me if you want to chat."
"Sorry I thought you already had one foot out the door!

What I read was that you think this guy has gone about as far as he's ever going to go in life - which at 25, is a very depressing way to be. That you think he's never really going to stand up for the two of you as a unit. That you think he lacks imagination and vision and that he is already stagnant.

When you are upset or put out, he is passive and dismissive. He doesn't mind benefiting from you, but he won't compensate you when you lose from putting yourself out there for him.

I'm sure he has some lovely qualities and you wouldn't be dating him otherwise. But I don't know too many women who would like to date him."
"i mean....if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...it's not a witch

&amp;#x200B;

to me as an outside observer, it sounds like cheating"
"Not normal. And especially offensive because you don't do the same things to him when he wants to go out. 

This is an issue that can run really deep and should be addressed. He's insecure and possibly quite patriarchal."
"He‚Äôs a grown ass man. If he were **1**6 that‚Äôs one thing, but he‚Äôs **3**6. 

His parents would survive if he continued dating you.

He is in full control of his life at 36 to make decisions that he wants.

He chose his parents over you, it‚Äôs that simple. He can play the cultural card all he wants, but that doesn‚Äôt change he fact that he, an almost 40 year old man, a man old enough to run for office in the US, chose his mommy and daddy over a happy relationship. 

I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you, but better now than for him to keep this charade up even longer."
"&gt;I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd do it if she didn‚Äôt enjoy it

If people only went around doing things they enjoy doing, society would crumble in a minute. You‚Äôre essentially admitting to being a passive partner, not contributing equally to growing your relationship. I refer to it as the ‚Äúmental load‚Äù some people call it ‚Äúemotional labor.‚Äù Think about how exhausting it probably is for her to be the one constantly driving your relationship while you kick back in the passenger seat. She‚Äôs deciding what you have for dinner, what activities you do together, she‚Äôs the only one initiating any intimacy... She‚Äôs doing it because she wants the relationship to grow and be worthwhile. Step it up, man. You‚Äôre taking her for granted. Plan some dates, talk to her and show her you want to be in that relationship for more than convenience."
"Having your own finances is healthy to a point, but this is just insane. You live together and have a two year old daughter - and he won't pay for the car that drives his daughter around? Fuck this guy. This is what your life is going to be like every day with him. Do yourself a favor and leave, while getting the courts to make him pay child support. Record some of the shit he says to you to help your case."
"The overprotective thing might not be far off. She did make a career out of sleeping with OP‚Äôs boyfriends, bet she‚Äôs worried about karma. Plus, cheaters project. 

Also, OP, your husband sucks."
"This might not make sense til you're much older and have some life experience under your belt.  That was the verbal expression of how insecure they are.   The most incorrect thing you could do is make it be about you.  If she grows up normally, she will one day cringe about that moment, but if she's not mature enough to understand why it was cringey yet, then she's not gonna get it right now. It sucks, and it's not fair. All you can do is not internalize it and make it change you for the worse.  I'm sorry that happened to you; you're a good bro for saying that to her, and some woman in the future will appreciate that kind of attention to detail."
"You should go to the bank with ID and change the account type. 

You may need to involve a lawyer. I'd log in online and screenshot the balance right away. Try to change the account type if possible. 

Then I'd start applying for summer jobs right away. 

You'll also want to call their financial aid office to see about loans."
"Well, here is the thing.  He does understand.  He knows its not fair.  He just likes it this way.  He likes you at home taking care of the children with no social life of your own.  He doesn't like you out having fun and being an individual.  You are right--you are an adult.  You get to make your own choices.  So what do you want to do here?  Anything short of therapy will not work.  Arguing with him will not work.  Again--he knows and understands he's a hypocrite.  The only way this is going to change is if you take the reigns.  Best of luck."
"Don‚Äôt mention this video to him right now. Don‚Äôt change a thing until you see an attorney and get things in order. Once you‚Äôve done that, you can speak with hubs again and point out the video. (Have a back up.)

It‚Äôs best to leave him behind. He had a chance to come clean when you asked. He chose to burrow into the lie. You can do better than him and your child most definitely needs to see mom set a strong example of her own self worth and for the kid‚Äôs future."
"He wants to see where it goes with her? *Why?* Because he wants to keep his options open. He's acting here like he doesn't have a relationship, and if he's going to act like there's no relationship then there might as well not be one. Don't fight to keep this, it isn't worth the heartache he's intending to bring."
"If you have bruises on your arm, take a picture of them and text it to your dad so that there's a time stamp. Your dad should go to the store and ask if they could pull footage of her grabbing your arm and pulling your hair, the latter will look very damaging for your mother's case."
if the cat runs and hides soon as he walks in the door i guarantee he's beating its ass. I don't think a divorce is too over the top considering it seems that he's hiding some serious anger from you.
"That's what I'm thinking, too.  She finds a lot of gratification in singing / performing but she doesn't seem to go after those opportunities anymore.  For a while she was gigging around town but she stopped and I'm not sure why."

Each of you worry about your own relationship with John. That‚Äôs the one you can fix. The relationship between John and your parents is their issue to fix or not fix.
You're right. Having shitty parents is not fair. They may misbehave again. But since you want the financial support you have to be willing to play their game. Avoid any activity after the actual graduation. Don't spend time with them if they are drunk.
"Here is a comprehensive list of what it could be, besides cheating:"
"Sometimes you need to take a journey before you end up at your destination. You would not have met your current partner had you not dated/broken up with A. 

A is your stepping stone to your guy."
"Read, and get him to read, the articles ""she divorced me because I left dishes by the sink"" and ""I do not help my wife"". What really matters here is he agreed to something and isn't holding up his end of the bargain. So all you can really do is flat out tell him: ""you agreed to this, we decided on it together and you said you would do X Y Z and you're not doing it. That makes me feel like you don't really stick to promises, it makes me feel like I have to do more than we agreed to, it makes me feel unhappy."" And he'll either give a shit or he won't. If he doesn't, that's a major problem, because he'll be demonstrating that he can't be trusted to keep his word, he'll be demonstrating that your feelings aren't important to him, and that's not the behaviour of a good partner."
I'd break up with someone who disrespected me the way your boyfriend obviously disrespects you.
You are in  another abusive relationship.
"I've got a pretty similar relationship with my grandfather, for much the same reason. And all I can say is, like, that's fine? 

You don't have to forgive someone for bad behavior even if the victim of their behavior does. Just as two victims of abuse might make different decisions to forgive or not and each's decision doesn't invalidate the other's, any given victim's forgiveness of abuse is their *personal* decision, and not a decision made for the rest of the world. 

Imagine for a moment your grandfather had also abused someone else too, who never forgave him. That wouldn't change your father's decision, but whose decision on forgiveness should you then adopt? Well, neither. It's fine to make up your own mind about this.

And if your grandfather really has changed and repented, he'll understand that changing his behavior doesn't give him to right to demand people look past what he's done, that his behavior was deserving of disgust and rejection and that any love going forward in spite of that is a privilege and not a right. 

If he gets that, he should be able to hear ""I'd like to see past this for my family's sake, but I just can't. It's not in me to look past what you've done. I've tried, but trying to have a relationship with you is very taxing for me and I just can't do it."" If he hears that, great. The problem won't be solved entirely, but it'll give you a hell of a framework to work it out with the rest of your family too. If he can't hear that, if he insists his change and your father's forgiveness gives him the right to your affection, well then clearly he hasn't really acknowledged how awful his actions were."
"&gt;Getting him to drop the kids off at their grandparents often so he could  go on impulse vacation with me. Getting him to basically neglect them  and not even spend a lot of time with them when he had custody for the  weekend or week.

So this is kind of a red flag because it sounds like your boyfriend is more than happy to use you as an excuse to offload the kids.

It is *not* your responsibility to make sure that Jim takes his custody time and is a present parent,nor should it be. 

But be warned of three things: It is easier for Jim's family to blame you for his shortcomings as a parent than it is for them to admit he's behaving like a stereotypical Divorced Dad. It is easier for *Jim* to let you shoulder the blame. And it is entirely possible you are dating a father who is happy to de-prioritize the people he brought into the world in favor of his new girlfriend. 

What do you think any of these things say about Jim as a person?

Focusing on playing nice with Jim's family is a distraction from looking at Jim's choices. Redirect your attention."
"Oh, dear. I‚Äôm a little concerned that anyone could get to 35 and not think relationships take work.

Google: ‚Äòemotional labor‚Äô; ‚Äòinvisible labor‚Äô; ‚Äòwalkaway wives‚Äô and read the article ‚Äòwe aren‚Äôt nags, we‚Äôre just fed up‚Äô

See if any of that rings any bells. Women often do a lot of work men don‚Äôt see because so many things *just happen* for them. Like:

-Who buys holiday gifts for your respective families? Who coordinates holidays? Who decorates, plans events and makes sure they‚Äôre nice for everyone?

-Who plans your social life as a couple? Who finds activities and date spots? Who coordinates get togethers with friends? 

-Who does the emotional maintenance on the relationship? Who initiates ‚Äòchecking in‚Äô on each other? Who thinks about your connection to each other and maintaining intimacy,‚Äôthe spark‚Äô and open communication?

I wrote a lengthy comment to a guy whose dad seemed to embody this kind of well intentioned cluelessness here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ba5cw5/comment/ek97mg7"
"This comment is so much more than I could have asked for. Thank you so very much for this incredibly helpful and kind comment. 

Thankfully, the $15,000 includes room and board, just not personal expenses. And yes, it is spread out over the year. I already have a full-time job lined up for this summer and if all goes well, I should be able to make around $12,000 from this summer. 

I completely forgot about me now qualifying to be an ""independent."" That's great because I can now refile my FAFSA so that I am now an independent student instead of a dependent. I think that should really help with the financial aid. I have already contacted Brown's financial aid office and will call them tomorrow morning and talk through all of this. 

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to write out all of this fantastic advice for me. I appreciate this so so much."
"I think you can just be upfront with him. He's an adult, he can take it. Text or call him with your concerns. Hopefully he'll respectfully back off. If he doesn't then you've dodged a massive bullet."
"When I first met my ex husband‚Äôs family, I noticed that his grandfather seemed truly in love with his grandmother, while the grandmother seemed to barely tolerate her husband‚Äôs presence. I always thought it was sad and awful. 

I found out over time that his grandfather used to be very abusive toward his wife, but changed dramatically once he started taking medication for his mental illness. However, although they stayed together, those wounds never healed and any love she had for him was destroyed. 

They probably would have been much better off if they had separated. Even though he had remorse and changed his behavior, sometimes you can‚Äôt fix something that broken. If your love is gone, it‚Äôs ok to leave. It‚Äôs honestly better for everyone."
"It sounds like its his clothes that smell, and not him. I‚Äôd bring it up in that matter - ‚Äúhey, I noticed some of your older / more well worn shirts really trap your sweat. We might need to give them an extra thorough wash.‚Äù 

White vinegar is one of the BEST smell neutralizers I know.  Use around a cup of white vinegar (no detergent) with a load of just his stinky shirts. You might need to run them through a second time with detergent to eliminate the vinegar smell, but white vinegar can work magic. There a column called Ask A Clean Person by Jolie Kerr that has a lot of great cleaning tips you might never think of (used to be at the Hairpin, might now be at The NY Times)."
"This! ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what she really wants me to do, except these things she‚Äôs mentioned. Will someone help put this together for me?‚Äù

Dude, start with this post and not make a bunch of other people solve an issue you already know the answer to. This is more avoidance of emotional labor."
"That‚Äôs a really great insight. She is a bridesmaid in four weddings this year, including mine! The 4th one is her last single friend. I think it is maybe difficult for her to see everyone partnered off when she is alone."
"I went to see my grandfather for the last time a few months back. I knew it would be the last time I ever saw him, and I wanted to tell him how proud I was of him for surviving his emergency operation and proving everyone wrong by surviving for another few months. But when we got to the nursing home, he was too far gone to understand what I wanted to say. He was awake and conscious, but couldn't really remember where he was, or who I was. When my mum left me alone with him and I had a chance to talk to him, he asked me a question in his naive language (which I don't understand), and then stared out the window when he realised I couldn't reply. And I realised, this farewell wouldn't happen the way I had imagined it would. I couldn't force him to spend his last moments with me the way I wanted them to be, by talking to him in a language he could no longer understand, for my own benefit. So I sat quietly with him and held his hand.

Ten minutes later, my grandfather told my mother that he was tired and wanted to sleep. We were half-way outside when I realised this was my *last* chance to see him, and I rushed back to get one last look. He was already asleep, curled up on his side like a child, and the room was quickly starting to stink because the man in the bed beside him had just soiled himself. It wasn't a perfect moment, and I wanted to wait until the moment became perfect, but there was no chance of that. This was the only moment I could have. So  I took comfort in that my grandfather looked so peaceful and relaxed, and I left. 

The moments you have with your father will be special because you will be there with him. It doesn't matter what happens, what you say or do, they will be special because you will be together. So take the pressure off yourself for trying to make them special, and just be. You might be devastated, you might be in tears, you might be cracking jokes with your father and pretending everything is fine, you might feel numb, you might feel exhausted. Just feel whatever you feel. Just let the moment be whatever it is."
"I'm curious about the comment regarding your wedding.  Are a lot of friends getting married or partnered up while she is single? You're right at the age where many people are going to the beach or overseas with partners, are really busy with careers, having children, planning weddings, first time home purchases, etc. I'm wondering if she was feeling bored or lonely and has found a way to feel like she is never really alone, or to have something to obsess over/ do when alone."
"Just get out. Find a place you can share with roommates and get away from this creep. He's 36, he's going to be incredibly resistant to outside change. He's also a sad, pathetic attempt at an abuser. Just leave him."
RUN üëèüèº DONT üëèüèº WALK.
"I understand how it's a sensitive issue, but if you arent a healthy BMI then I think your SO should be able to address their concerns. 

60 pounds overweight is an issue for sure (I say this as also someone who struggles with weight), being able to discuss these things healthily is a very important part of a relationship, I don't think either of you are in the wrong here, he should probably have been more sensitive and brought it up in a better way, but let's be honest, it'll hurt to hear it no matter what."
That would be cheating with a dash of prostitution.
"‚ÄúI hate legal documents of love, raising babies, buying a house‚Äù 

Are you sure you should be getting married?"
What the fuck? Why are you having this person's kid? He doesn't seem to respect you at all. This is abusive. He cares more about getting himself off than you and your health. That is not someone you should be building a family with.
Yes we plan on having kids. I am also a voice-over actor and the plan was for me to switch over to doing that more than live performing while on maternity leave/first few months (I do voice-overs from home). My mother wants to help out with the future kids too so both the fianc√© and I can go back to work. I honestly don‚Äôt know if he would support our kids being performers if they ended up with the ‚Äòbug.‚Äô
"This guy doesn't respect you at all. If you're really so ""disposable"", just leave him and let him find someone else to use."
"I haven‚Äôt seen this mentioned yet so I wanted to throw it out there: you should lock down your credit ASAP and do whatever you have to to get any important papers they have of yours. Birth certificate, passsport, old tax returns, things like that. Go to the house when you know they‚Äôre out or even get a police escort. The paperwork belongs to you and they can‚Äôt legally withhold it. 

Your parents are abusive. Physically, emotionally, and financially. Your mom is used to controlling you and when she realizes that you don‚Äôt need her and you‚Äôre not going to come crawling back she‚Äôs going to do whatever she can think of to hurt you. Parents have all the info they need to steal a child‚Äôs identity and maybe it wouldn‚Äôt occur to her to do that, but I strongly recommend making sure she CANT. I believe credit freezes are now free so I‚Äôd strongly recommend freezing all 3 bureaus. You can call and unfreeze them any time you need to have it pulled."
"Your body, your choice. 

Double protection(oral contraceptive and condom) offers the most protection against possible pregnancy. 

The fact that he ‚Äúrefuses‚Äù to get tested for STIs is kind of troubling(in my eyes) as well..."
You leave. The money isn‚Äôt worth you feeling unloved. This is why people get divorced. Lots of people I know took far too many years to figure this out. Eventually you get too tired of his feelings being the only ones that matter.
"He should now be your exboyfriend.

1. he did something to you that you hate
2. he refused to stop when you told him
3. he held you down and refused to stop
4. you warned him what you would do if he did not stop
5. he SLAPPED you when you followed through
6. he BLAMED you for HIS behavior and actions 

This is a complete fail. LEAVE now!"

"&gt; I wish someone had told me this a long time ago, so I will share it with you now. This behaviour is not apart from all the wonderful parts of him. This hurtful behaviour is a part of him too. 

I wish we could sticky this at the top of the sub.

OP, when your partner belittles your pain, ignores your needs, and selfishly complains that you don‚Äôt sexually satisfy him enough during your period...*he is not a ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù partner*. He‚Äôs a jerk, who only treats you well when it‚Äôs easy and convenient for him.

Just like abusive partners are still abusive even if they‚Äôre nice the other 95% of the time, the same holds true of unsupportive assholes."
"I think it's best at this point to just let things go. You got the basic result that you wanted which was that the late assignments were graded and accepted with just a small penalty. So on some level, he acknowledged that your argument had merit and that he was partially at fault.

But this guy is also on a power trip. So he had to try to assert his power over you one last time. That's an ego thing that you can't rationalize away. So just take your points and let him 'assert his power' and try to steer clear as best you can for the rest of the school year.

This is a really good example of what your life in a workplace will actually look like. Bosses have a lot of power and aren't always fair. You did a good job standing up for yourself and defending you and your fellow 'employees', but IRL you can't take that past a certain point or you'll get fired."
"&gt;It's not that he's short on money, he's a lawyer and his parents paid for most of his schooling so he's probably one of the most well off of everyone. I think he just has these really strict principles around money.

I'm not sure it's just a matter of him having super strict principles, as much as that your system relies a lot on mutual trust that nobody is going to take advantage of the situation, and that trust isn't there with your boyfriend because he's a very recent addition to the group and has more money than most of them. Personally I have the same system with a small handful of my closest friends, but I wouldn't really like to do things that way with a group that included people I don't know too well or hang out with very regularly. 

If you guys are willing to meet him halfway and try to have people just pay for their own drinks but take turns on Ubers from bar to bar, the issue may resolve itself in time as your boyfriend becomes more of a part of the group. Other than that, I'm not sure what you should do about the situation, but hopefully it's helpful to have my two cents."
"&gt;I later found out that I spouses weren‚Äôt invited to the rehearsal dinner

Rehearsal dinners are usually put on by the grooms family.... so your parents in law didn't invite you to the rehearsal dinner?! YOURE FAMILY. also, I don't understand why the bridal party would need separate rooms before the wedding? this all seems so strange.

But in general this all just sounds very weird. Your husband and you lack general communication to a concerning degree. I really think you need couples counseling to get to the bottom of why you seem to know nothing of each others simple plans."
"I think it was wrong of you to put your dad in that position.  I realize you didn't want your mom to know, but that was a pretty difficult thing to keep secret from his own partner.  I doubt you'd like to be in that position.

It does suck that your mom told everyone, but don't lose track of the fact that your SO cheated and any change in how they view him is based on his actions, not your mom's.  It's no one else's responsibility to hide his poor choice and the consequences are pretty clear when that happens.

That said, tell anyone who asks that it happened, you worked through it and you're in a good place.  That will be the end of it.  Then make it the end of it."
"Well...if there is a happy marriage in your future, it's not with this guy. Not if he makes you feel ashamed of what really is a huge part of who you are. That's kinda fucked."
"Why are you even in touch with these horrible people? LPT: You can cut abusive parents out of your life once you reach adulthood. And make no mistake, these two shits life saddled you with for parents **ARE** abusive.

Only three words you need ever say to them again: Fuck you. Goodbye. 

Never keep people in your life who hurt you. Life is too short."
"Not to mention, your husband should have to tell them. ""Unfortunately -- as you know -- I have been unfaithful to my marriage, its recently come to light, and it is not a good time to visit."""
"Not offending is not your primary concern, your baby is.  Your husband needs to address this with his family.  The fact that he so casually dismisses it is an issue between you and him."
"Fuck divorce etiquette. What your dad did the woman he is with now is morally reprehensible on both of their parts.  They aren't in a position to criticize you at all, especially not in regards to something at the foundation of their  very low moral character.

Also, this may be an unpopular opinion, but if your step sister does come to the university and you have never met her before, it may be worth meeting her (casual, and without any other family). You might find that she is disgusted by her mom the same way you are with your dad."
"You're not the secret. He's not hiding you. He's hiding his toxic mother from you. For your own good.

He told you this already. 
You already know why this is happening. 

Look I know you're not used to toxic family members but believe me, they are real and he's doing you a favour. This isn't about you."
"&gt;  If she wants no contact, give it to her. Live your life. Lean on friends.

She should go no contact even if her mom wants to reconnect.  They sound so horrible."
"Install security cameras ASAP. You can get them cheap online. You want as much coverage of your property as you can get and of your front door.

You're probably going to have to go full restraining order against this dude, but that starts with creating a trail of evidence. Security camera up."
"You're doing it.  Therapy.  There's no quick fix for a rewiring.  I've rewiring from my abusive childhood for twenty years.  It's always a constant work in progress.  I would talk with your therapist about coping skills for not blowing up at him.  Also, you need to work on the skills to recognize that some things are a big issue and pick those things out of the pack.  Don't go the opposite direction."
"Unfortunately, yes. 

* You can‚Äôt change them.  

* You can‚Äôt control them.  

* You can‚Äôt make them care about you or your sister, or either of your feelings.  

* You can‚Äôt motivate them to stop or slow their drinking.  

* You can‚Äôt force them to not drink or not get drunk at any event, no matter how important it is to you.

* You can‚Äôt get them to ‚Äúsee the light‚Äù of how much they are hurting you or your sister.

* You can‚Äôt get them to acknowledge or validate your feelings, apologize for hurting both of you, or show any empathy or care whatsoever about you or her.  

The bottom line is, your parents are addicts, and by nature are selfish and piss-poor parents.  They are not the parents you and your sister deserved or needed, and *never will be*.  The minute both of you truly accept this and let go of any hope that they will change or be any different, the easier it will be to heal.

I get it.  I was abused growing up, and I tried for *30 years* to get my parents to either a) stop abusing me or b) understand or care about my feelings.  They never did.  Because **they are too flawed, broken and selfish to be the parents I needed them to be.** I had to let go of the notion that they would ever be that.  It was fucking hard, and it took *years* of therapy, but I‚Äôm finally starting to detach.

You and your sister are good people and have good hearts, *in spite of your parents*, and not because of them.  So what do you do ?

First, invite them to the graduation, but maybe don‚Äôt do a dinner afterward.  Second, work toward being independent.  Do both of you plan to work, or obtain more schooling ?  If it‚Äôs the former, then save up and find a place together so you can be free of your parents (**and ffs, don‚Äôt ever give them money, no matter what, like EVER for ANY reason !!**). If it‚Äôs the latter, then do the math to see if you can work part-time and do school, or work full-time and do school part-time with loans.  *Find some way to get out from under your parents‚Äô thumbs.*  Life will be a lot easier when you do.

And finally, therapy.  You both need therapy for how your parents‚Äô selfishness and abuse have deeply affected you.  Some good therapy will teach you to let go of any hope or notion that they will be anything but who they are now, and heal from their abuse.  I highly recommend it."
"I'm sorry OP, he's an asshole and right now you're basically his isolated, live-in ""bang maid"".

None of the things you wrote about his good features even come close to outweigh or explain his shitty behavior. Just move out and get a divorce and find someone new. You're better off in every conceivable way. And don't fall for his crocodile tears when you leave. Hell, just leave when he's at work and leave divorce papers on the table (or have him served while you're gone)."
Is your husband distressingly literal in other ways?
"It‚Äôs not selfish at all. What you dealt with was harrowing and traumatizing and being continually reminded of it is just re-traumatizing. Have you ever dealt with it in terms of therapy? It may be beneficial to talk it out with someone if you haven‚Äôt. 

It‚Äôs totally understandable why you resent your dad and even his wife. I wouldn‚Äôt take it out on the kids, though, since they didn‚Äôt play any part in this and may have even gone through a similarly harrowing adjustment period - although probably less than yours, considering your mother. But regardless, it‚Äôs fine to not want any reminders of the most traumatizing event in your life. It‚Äôs fine not to want any relationship with them. Even if she goes to your college, I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a big school as universities tend to be, and as a freshman she won‚Äôt overlap any classes with you. 

If you‚Äôre confronted (like if they expect you to help her with the material or show her around the school or whatever), tell her not to take it personally, but your dad‚Äôs new ‚Äúfamily‚Äù only reminds you of the horrible way your own family fell apart because of him and that it‚Äôs not her fault, but for your own mental health you can‚Äôt have any kind of relationship with her."
"&gt; My husband has panic disorder. 

...who diagnosed this? 

Because if the answer is ‚Äúmy husband,‚Äù I gotta tell you, this doesn‚Äôt look like any panic disorder I‚Äôve ever seen. It looks like your-husband-is-a-hair-trigger-asshole. I have yet to see someone in the throes of a panic attack *follow the alleged source of anxiety* into another room to yell at it some more. And I‚Äôm betting he doesn‚Äôt do this shit with his friends or bosses or coworkers.

Your husband needs therapy all right, but I think he needs to be in an abuser program. If he only seems to direct his rage-fits at people who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt fight back, it‚Äôs not panic - it‚Äôs abuse."
"He purposely tried to make you feel jealousy and unease about this trip and her. And seems to still be doing it during the trip. That's so immature it's pathetic. 

I would absolutely be super pissed if my partner did that. Not jealous, but angry. 

Whether he's into her or not, who knows. But what he said to you was uncalled for."
"Those weren‚Äôt subtle comments about taking her life. She has a plan. She‚Äôs trying to push you away first hoping to spare you. You need to have her Baker Acted. She‚Äôs making plans to end her life. I don‚Äôt give a shit what she‚Äôs afraid her family will say, it‚Äôs better than her dead. You need to call 911 or get her into the car willingly. If she does take her own life, you‚Äôll never forgive yourself- even if you did absolutely all you could. Please go home right now and take care of your life. This is a SCREAM for help."
"Yeah I agree with what you‚Äôre saying, I don‚Äôt want a 50/50 split by any means, just to be able to ask him for help from time to time and not get the ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working‚Äù speech and then refusal to help. And I really do wish I could cut down the amount I clean but it‚Äôs literally what my husband tells me to do everyday and he goes round and checks when he gets home."
"Well, I hate to say but tough. There is nothing you can do yourself to get them to stop and you shouldn't be harassed by his family. He's not asking them to be your best friend. He's asking them to stop making wild accusations and to give you a chance. A guy whose unwilling to stand up to his family and ask them to act like reasonable adults is not the guy you want to be dating.

You need to consider whether being a parent one day is a deal breaker for you. Because it's unfair to invest more into this relationship if it is. It'll only get harder to end it as your feelings grow, so don't lead himself or yourself on in a relationship that isn't going anywhere."
"Don't tactfully tell him anything.  Tell him that you are no longer interested via text and block him.  I am not usually one to advocate this, but it's been three weeks and he has steamrolled reasonableness.  Be clear and block him.  

I'm sorry you are going through this, I understand how it might be anxiety inducing."
Your response seems in line with what everyone else in the thread so far has been saying. Thank you all for the perspective.
"Yes. Be upfront.

""Hey (dude). I know our dinner appointment is coming up, and I hope you will forgive my directness and maybe presumption, but I have realized we might be going into it with different expectations. I'm hoping for a friendly dinner--nothing romantic. That ok by you?""

If you get anything back other than ""of course!"" then bow out."
"&gt; He says I shouldn't be worried because she's gay and I agreed with this reasoning from the beginning because I met her and though she was cute, she was still very ""tom boyish"" so I didn't think anything of it. She was ""one of the guys"". But sometimes she does dress up to appear more feminine and she's really hot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be the one to point out that if she's gay she's gay no matter how she's dressed.  

That aside, your issue is really that your BF seems to be prioritizing time with someone who isn't you, and that's certainly worth a conversation."
"See? thats another fucking reason she shouldn't have ever done that. 

OP, your mom made this dumb financial decision. For the love of god, don't stay in this relationship to help her right her mistake."
"&gt; I‚Äôm not confrontational to a fault. If the first she hears from me is a lecture I‚Äôd be disappointed to ruin what‚Äôs left of the night with my bad energy.

There's non-confrontation and then there's doormat.  Don't be a doormat.  People only give you the respect you require."
"Just move out and stop paying for her stuff. You are 27. You don't need to be able to pay her bills and yours when you move out. She will have to figure it out... But at 58 she should have figured that out already. 

If you really cannot move out until you know she is taken care of... Find her last tax return and see if she actually makes that little. She may be lying to you."
"This is why you don't move in with someone so early in a relationship. You are allowed to have boundaries of what you want hanging up in your home and if you don't want a picture of your boyfriend's ex's butt hanging in your home, that's a perfectly reasonable boundary to have."
"Wait, so you never told your parents, or a counselor or anyone?  

Firstly I think you should talk to someone, and not keep it so bottled up.  You may feel a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders.

It's a tricky situation with the girlfriend, her words could have been thoughtless, and she doesn't fully think that, just her friend's influence.  But it might.  The only way you could find out is to ask her, which means the ultimate trust and sharing your story.

I'm so sorry that you went through so much, and it sounds like you've kept your life together really well despite those challenges.  I hope the best for you."
"&gt; Does anyone know how to stop his words from stinging me so hard?

Dump him dump him dump him. Why haven't you dumped him yet?

&gt; I used to be able to ignore his comments

Why would you ignore his comments when you could call him out, have it out and possible dump him? What's going on here?"
"Yeah, that's not okay.  

Tell your Dad.  Ask him to set up a joint account (at a different bank) and deposit your checks into that account.  And don't get a debit card for the account so Mom can't use your money.

FYI, your parents have to pay for your expenses (basics like food, housing, clothes) until you're 18.  So, if Mom says you owe rent or utilities, tell her to pack sand.

It may be time to go live with Dad, if that's an option."
"&gt; I have been telling him for YEARS I need new clothes and shoes, and now that I am looking at divorce lawyers, suddenly he's scrambling. Where was this remorse 6 months ago?

The remorse appeared because the divorce affects HIM. His acquiescence to your requests now is not a change of heart, it's just a new manifestation of his selfishness.

&gt; I am at the point where I fear playing music by my favorite band, because every time he hears a single note, he starts in. ""UGH this shit again, when are these guys going to die already?""

This is just plain cruel. Music is one of the most deep and personal parts of a person's soul, and he can't just walk to another room if he doesn't like it? He has to kill your joy and make you afraid of something that should be a source of calm in your life? My ex-boyfriend was a huge U2 fan. I DESPISE U2. But you bet your ass I watched a 2-hour long documentary about them with him and sat through endless videos of concerts because I loved him. If I were with him for 14 years I'd probably have eventually confessed I didn't like U2, but I would have never dreamed of bad-mouthing their music because I knew how important it was to him.

&gt; He doesn't ask about my day, or what I did, or anything.

On top of everything else, can you really do this the rest of your life? You say you love him so much and I hate to be harsh, but from what you wrote it does not sound like he's reciprocating that love in any meaningful way or treating it with the care it deserves. Even if you go to counseling, can you trust that any changes will actually stick after so many years of neglect and selfishness?"
"So much of this is really dependent on what you and your mother are really willing to do. Your father is not going to change and the situation may just get worse. Refusing to care for your father may mean that things will get much worse before it gets better. If he goes home and you and your mother are not there to care for him, it may mean that he sits in his own filth until he's willing to let a professional come in and take care of him. 

Make an appointment with the social worker at the hospital or rehab. Tell them that you and your mother are refusing to care for your father after he is discharged. Tell them everything. Tell your father that you and your mother will no longer care for him and he will need to work with the social worker to figure out a plan for his care after he is discharged. Then step away. Stop talking to him, don't visit, don't take his calls, let him be responsible for working it out with the social worker. He will lose his shit. Don't listen to his voicemail messages. If the social worker calls, keep saying over and over again that you and your mother refuse to care for your father.

Tell your mom to get at least an initial consultation with a lawyer so she knows what she can and can't do legally.

Just don't lose sight of the fact that he won't change. He is not suddenly going to become docile and easy to manage. The only thing you can change is how you react to him."
"Yeah, it sounds like he just plain doesn't like a fundamental part of who OP is, and that doesn't make them seem super compatible."
"I'm long past throwing fits about my dad's questionable relationship choices lol

I feel like he's pushing her to break up by making a big deal out of something that doesn't have to be a big deal tbh"
"You just wrote that this guy is a broke, drug addicted, lying dead beat who will ruin your life and you are trying to find a way to make it work. He is a 30 year old with the maturity of a 14 year old. Find someone worth your time and effort."
"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. 

He may think he is ‚Äúdisowning‚Äù your child but what that really means is he is going to get wrecked on child support. 

I would start consulting divorce lawyers immediately."
"so your whole family has disowned you because of a few tweets, which wasnt a problem, until you almost died. and strangely enough these incredibly abusive people STILL didnt rush to your side?
newsflash: the abuse never stopped. you just moved away. please stop pretending you can have a relationship with anyone who can treat you like this. 
have you gone to therapy for the trauma you have experienced? it would help a lot! as an adult who dealt with abusive parents therapy saved my life. 
stop expecting anything from these people. find a group of friends who love you regardless of what you tweet. 
your family is not your friend."
"If your husband waffles on this, google toxoplasmosis and its effect on infants and tell him that's why you won't be taking your child there."
"You can love him but not want to live with him right now.

Maybe you move out for a while, live with a friend or relative.

Each have some time to think how the marriage degraded over time.

Maybe it will bring about a change.

Or the two of you can be friends.

Love can continue in different forms.

And as we all sadly know, love sometimes isn't enough to sustain a happy marriage.  I still love my ex.  He's my son's dad.  I'll always love him.  But I just can't be coupled with him."
13 is precisely the right age to be moody and obsessive about a hobby. Invite him out for food or a movie. That's about the best you can do.
"For real, don't volunteer if you need to rely on an unwilling participant to do it. OP, she's pretty much forcing you to volunteer with her in terms of time and money investment."
You as the mother have to put your foot down.  That baby doesnt go in that house.
"He‚Äôs a MOOCH!  He‚Äôs using you.  üõë paying for anything for him, his friends, sister, etc.  

Get rid of him unless you want to support his entire family, roommates, and friends and maybe he‚Äôs going to add some co-workers too."
"""doesn‚Äôt value women‚Äôs opinions or work""

How do *you* get through to him? You don't, you're one of those valueless woman (I assume he values you for certain things, but as you said, not for what's between your ears)."
"&gt; To clarify re the 'younger brother' comment, my GF is only about 3 months older than me. However, she was born in 1992, and I in 1993, hence technically, she is 1 year older than me. 

Your actual age gap isn't relevant. She was referring to your immaturity, not the calendar. She could have said the same thing even if you were older than her.

&gt; We had a long talk after that - after which she explained why she was unable to respond to my messages as that period was literally the busiest period of her life and she was late because she had a run-in with an unruly driver. To give everyone an idea of how busy she was, she slept about half an hour every day for 3 days. [...]
&gt;Over the course of the next few weeks, I began feeling extremely insecure that she was not able to meet me and text me as often. 

So she told you she was busy with her work and her conferences and life, etc. and that's why she couldn't be as responsive. Why didn't you take her at her word? 

&gt; It was difficult for me to change my perspective; I think it required about 2-3 'sessions' of reassurance before I was able to overcome my irrational thinking. 

That's quite a lot of ""reassuring"" she's had to do recently. Especially for someone so busy, who probably wanted to spend her ""boyfriend time"" in less tedious ways.


The long and short of it is, she has learnt from her past relationships that it's better if she prioritises herself and her own well-being first, and the relationship second. But it seems like you want a girlfriend who will prioritise the relationship/you first, and herself second. Neither attitude is inherently wrong, but they're not really compatible either."
"That‚Äôs the dumbest shit. Tell him it was nice that he wanted to make up for it, but bringing you a puppy was over the top and irresponsible. If he is in love with the dog and he paid for it, he can raise it and pay for everything it needs."
Lawyer for custody and child support. Therapist to help you deal. Friends and family to lean on.
"In the not so far away future, we are going to have rehab facilities engineered for social media addiction recovery. There will be a 7 step recovery system, so different than alcohol."
Ooh well said! There is nothing whatsoever wrong with having a friend of the opposite sex. There are a lot of things that I enjoy about my husband (obv) but some parts of my life I don‚Äôt connect with him like I do male friends who are in the same field as me. We connect on a different level. And that‚Äôs okay!! It is a good thing to have connections to other people who may challenge our day to day dynamics.
"Lol harsh. I doubt I'd feel that cavalier about it. Of course there's good things about our relationship and him that I'd miss. It would hurt me too. 

But just the disrespect for my time, money, and our relationship is something I'm not sure I can move on from unless drastic changes occur immediately."
"I thought you were overreacting until you said she told you they went out for coffee, but you saw the pictures on her social media that show that is not true."
"You could even phrase it from a different direction. ‚ÄúHey, I know you‚Äôve got your hands full with the wedding. Is there anything I can do to help that isn‚Äôt being taken care of by one of the bridesmaids?‚Äù It acknowledges that you aren‚Äôt one of them, gives her an opening to explain if she wants to, but also shows you supporting her anyway if you still want to."
"I mean he's told me before that he's okay with me telling basically anyone I like, but I don't do it. My best friend knows (just because I wanted to talk to SOMEONE about it) and one of our mutual good friends does, but I think that's about it for who I've told (and can't even remember if I was the one who told the mutual friend or not).

He's told a couple of his friends, and even B, so he's not ashamed of it, and isn't necessarily ""in the closet"".

That still doesn't mean telling C is a good option, though. It just wouldn't be a betrayal of trust."
"The relationship you have with your husband doesn't sound healthy at all. There is absolutely no need to keep the house tidy as thoroughly as you are doing. It's ridiculous to bleach the bathroom everyday or to hoover the house every single day.

It sounds like you're too far in it to turn things around since you validated his ridiculous demands for years. He probably sincerely believes he's in the right and it also seems he doesn't see you as an equal but as an subordinate. You could use a healthy amount of feminism.

I'm afraid I don't have any concrete advice for you but I wish you have the strength to get out if this situation."
I would keep it light before diving into a heavy emotional apology through text. The best apology would be to say sorry face to face after some time.
"Girl speaking: not all girls do or say the same thing. The only way you'll know if this girl wants a second date is when you ask her on one.

You had a good time? Stop asking the internet about it or waiting to see if she talks to you first. Send her a message saying you had a good time."
"Yep. Good job going for it though.

Now that you know, keep a line open for studying or hitting up social events as a friend. I mean, ideally you wouldn't have any ulterior motive other than being friends, but I think it's OK to try to 'expand your friend group' or try to meet her friends. It's a natural thing, but it's definitely easy to push too hard and become creepy.

Again, exposing your ulterior motives is never a good idea. You seem like a decent guy trying to figure things out, so I trust you'll take this advice in the spirit that it's given."
He's really 26? Sounds like an immature jerk.
She 100% cheated with the ex. I'm with you here.
"But it‚Äôs true? You will have a much harder time conceiving if your weight is not within a healthy range. You will have a higher chance of miscarriage as well. I think he came from a place of genuine concern for your health and health of future baby, although it was hurtful it is something you should consider."
Tell him to go fuck himself.Seriously.
"Sounds like you're his reserve. You can be around, but he'll still look for his babymaker. Since you don't want kids, you must not get hurt if he puts you on the shelf... right? Not enough value on you as a person. Seems like he only got back with you after getting let down by the other options.

Take some time to recover. Find someone who wants to be with you, not someone who's windowshopping."
Have you considered just ending it?  You‚Äôre miserable every minute you are with him.  There‚Äôs no reason to keep going with this relationship.
"Don't say anything to him. If you do you will make it into a *thing* and it will become an argument you're entangled in. Just keep your head down and let your Dad and the GF work things out on their own. 

Most likely, your Dad will push her away with his insecurities and the huge age gap. After that, y'all can just be friends."
"&gt;I have some male friends, strictly male friends(nothing has or will ever happen inappropriately) not code or anything like that.

What the fuck business would literally *anything* you might have in your chat history, with your friends, *on your phone*, *which he took from you over your objections*, have been of his? What could possibly have been ""inappropriate"" about your relationships with your friends, when this guy is a total fucking stranger who has no stake in anything you do? Why are you justifying yourself to him?

&gt;Does this sound like controlling behavior?

I don't think ""controlling behaviour"" is a strong enough term. It sounds like he thinks he's bought ownership of your life for the price of a single compliment. Worryingly, it sounds like you half agree.

&gt;Any advice on how to handle this situation?

Tell him you don't want any further contact with him, then block him on everything (or mute him, so that if he freaks out you have records of it for later). Tell someone you trust about it so you have some backup in case he escalates. Do not ever meet him or be alone with him.

You don't describe a single reason why you would *want* to have any further contact with this guy. He sounds like an unhinged asshole. Just steer well clear. Listen to the instincts that are correctly telling you he's dangerous, and examine what impulses are telling you to ignore those instincts."
"Usually when someone says that they mean emotional work, or perhaps something like household chores and responsibilities. What‚Äôs your household responsibilities split like? Who organizes date night? What do you do when she has a hard day at work? What does she do when you have a hard day at work? That kind of thing."
"I think as awkward and painful as it may be, it's better to ask and know than to feel the way you do.

You don't have to ask directly about official adoption.  Ask him what he wants for you long term and if he wants you to stay when the baby becomes a part of his life.  Tell him you'd very much like to stay, if he wants you to."
Your friend is homophobic and not a good friend.
"I think you just have to continue doing what you plan to do and when she asks remind her you'll be home when you are home. Maybe set up a day to leave the house and actually spend some one on one time, she may miss you, have anxiety and this is her unhealthy way of expressing that. I would do this sooner then later and see if that changes her mood a bit. dont invite the rest of the fam, just you two. If she has anxiety she would probably beenfits from talking to a professional.

If you want independence though i wouldnt be asking your sister to drive you your dinner that your mom cooked....make your own and bring to work or buy your own. 

If she continues and  you cant take it then the only option is to move out. Also beware if you are finanically independent for law school this may affect that."
"First, you did nothing wrong. You didnt ruin their marraige - he did. He ruined his own career too. 

If you were my friend (I'm a guy) I'd tell you to call the cops if he is threatening you."
This is the person your bf is. He isn't gonna change for you. I suggest not building a life with someone that you aren't on the same page regarding finances.
"&gt;My wife and I have resolved to not attend any event they attend until they reach out to us and apologize for the verbal abuse and threats

This is the appropriate boundary to set. Let them know of this, and ALSO let them know that if they attempt to invite you to something without telling you that the boyfriend will also be there, that will be a huge problem for your relationship. 

&gt; I was thinking the next time I see my SIL‚Äôs boyfriend, I am going to pull him aside and let him know as of today, we do not have a problem, but if he ever raises his voice at my wife ever again we are going to have a big problem.

Don't do this. The guy is a completely loose cannon and doing this makes you more unsafe. Your best bet to protect your family is to avoid him entirely. If he's present, leave. Do not engage at all."
That‚Äôs the thing you don‚Äôt understand. Any 29 that agrees to date a teenager is at least a little immature. Most people at 29 see 19 year olds as practically children.
Move on she‚Äôs a whole red flag
"Thanks for this. I'm actually going to show him your comment because it sounds like what he's been trying to tell me, though he hasn't been able to explain it quite so succinctly."
"&gt;&gt;He told me that my quitting was supposed to make his life easier and it didn't feel like that was happening

I've noticed that there is a certain type of personality that doesn't respect you once they view you as the maid. He's your employer in his eyes, not a team member, and so he gets to get mad at you for not catering to his whims or reading his mind. Not sure how you can fix this, although it's good you're going to therapy."
"Wtf with some of these comments? Jesus Christ she doesn‚Äôt need to see things from his prospective of whatever the bullshit. 

Look op. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom currently. I clean I do shit around the house. But you know what? My partner who equally helped make this baby, is also interested in being a dad. He wants our toddler to see that both mom and dad work to make this house a home and that we‚Äôre equal. My husband isn‚Äôt my boss or overseer. I don‚Äôt ask to go out I don‚Äôt have to make sure things are facing a certain way. That is not normal, please believe me. I also want to ask if would be comfortable with your kids treating their partner like this? Or if their partner treated them like this? IF the answer is no, then it should tell you that you deserve better too.    

Being a sahm is hard. It‚Äôs exhausting and isolating. I feel you. Is there anyway you can look into therapy for yourself? I think it would do you wonders. I also just want to reiterate that your husband‚Äôs behavior towards you isn‚Äôt normal. You are his equal. 

Also do you have any friends or family that you can hang out with? Let dad take care of the kids for a couple of hours. You are human and you need to take care of yourself too"
"Your husband is a terrible person.   I don't understand the lack of communication around the concert or the St. Patrick's Day outing.   Does he hide other plans from you?   I feel like both of those things would have been topics of discussion well before the day of the event.    He says ""I thought you knew"" a lot.   Why does he think you know about this stuff if he doesn't tell you?   Who does he think you are talking to?  

Will your husband go to couples counseling with you?  Does he see and acknowledge that the relationship is spiraling?"
"Unfortunately, you're in another relationship that has all the signs of abuse. This controlling and suspicious is a huge red flag that a.] he's probably cheating on you and b.] this behavior will only escalate. 

Get out now."
"Honestly, your parents sound like they are rather abusive.  If I were you I would get the abortion, get a lawyer and get your money, then use it to get your education.  Leave your parents behind until they can demonstrate some civility and kindness."
"He's not just putting down your job, though. He's making you feel ashamed of your passion in life. He doesn't have to be a performer to get that performing makes you happy. A loving partner supports your passions whether they share them or not. My husband is a car nut and I'm not. There's still a '66 Mustang in the garage, because I want him to be happy.

Your fiance doesn't love all of you. You can't build a life on that. I suppose I should suggest counseling, but I doubt Mr. Logical Software Guy would agree."
Lol I'd chill on getting married. These are big differences that need to be addressed.
"&gt;A note here, our therapist has instructed us not to talk to them about any of this. She said we need to keep this private if we want a chance to succeed and that this would not be a healthy conversation

Honestly, this advice makes having a relationship with these people impossible. If you are to be friends, you HAVE to address it."
"You're ignoring the forest for the trees.


The larger problem here isn't chores.


The larger problem is that your boyfriend is immature, irresponsible, unwilling to listen to you, unwilling to compromise, and unwilling to change.


I'm sure he's a great enough guy, but as long as you frame this as a ""chores"" problem and not a ""values/compatibility"" problem, you're going to struggle to make progress, if it's possible. This is not someone I would be willing to share a home with any longer, personally."
"Be direct with him ""Sam, I think there has been a misunderstanding so I need to make something very clear. As much as I appreciate you as a friend, I only see you as a friend. I have no interest in dating you, being your girlfriend or anything like that. You searching the entire library for me makes me uncomfortable, as I feel like it's too much for us just being friends. If you want to be friends, I'd really enjoy that but if you want something else, then maybe a step back from each other would be best for both of us."""
"‚ÄúCrisis only responder‚Äù is a great description. This dude isn‚Äôt even that though, he‚Äôs a ‚Äúcrisis affecting his ability to do whatever‚Äù only responder. It‚Äôs gross"
"You can have respite care come and be there while one of you is with them.

   That way they are doing the work, and you are available as backup if she does need to be assisted.

 The respite care worker will learn how to work with her, so you can rest.

 You both need a break, you both need to be able to outsource something."
"Nothing you say will change the behavior of your mom. If anything, you'll be risking making it worse. The best thing you can do for your brother is helping him become independent of your mom as soon as he turns 18."
This is the best reply so far. Your partner doesn‚Äôt have to satisfy every single need you have. It‚Äôs okay if these are catered for by your friends and family. Unless that need is a dealbreaker for you of course.
"Yeah, it's hard. Better now though than in a few more years though, trying to accommodate him a bit here and a bit there, and end up sacrificing opportunities and yourself because you love him and want to make a life with him... and only finally realize how fucked up it is to want that anymore."
"He has a backbone, he's standing up to you isn't he?    

You are fooling yourself, he's not a good guy, you know it, and you have proof but yet you keep making excuses for him.    Then when you finally do the right thing you feel guilty.  Which is further proof that he's been manipulating you.    

Stay broken up.  Remember your SO should treat you better than anyone else and should never need to be told to treat you with love, honor and respect.  If you aren't being treated with love, honor and respect then it's time to move on.  You should never make excuses for your SO, ever."
"Honestly girl.  Just leave.  Even if you're eating ramen and cheese sandwiches.  I was living off $2k/month a year an a half ago. My rent was $750 (plus bills/car)  Did it suck? Yes it really did. But I can guarantee it will suck less than living with this fucking piece of trash. 

On your own you won't have to worry about some surprise legal fees because he left drugs in your car or surprise garbage credit because he put bills in your name and didnt pay them. 

Shit you could even get a 2nd job.  Dont wait, this guy is going to fuck your life up so much more the longer you stay."
"After college it‚Äôs not just the $250 flight (plus money for lodging, and food, and activities) that‚Äôs a problem, it‚Äôs the *having an entire month to travel*. Not to mention the whole social aspect of having a large group of fellow students with you."
I think you might benefit from exploring the idea of dating a grown up who doesn't have so many issues with impulsive behavior.
You did the right thing OP. This guy doesn't seem ready to officially leave his wife and didn't seem able to prioritize you.
and he also may be projecting his poor decisions during his outings onto her.
"Yes, you should make a big deal out of it.  She has no respect for you or your time.  I wouldn't even get past the first time that happened."
"It doesn't matter if you leave him or not. Either way, she won't see that money back in full."
Your sister is just jealous that you two had a bond and want to tarnish it. Your father is not alive to defend himself so I say she is bullshitting.
"&gt; No, he doesn't want to go home - except if she goes with us. 

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

Nope. No. No way. This is so beyond disrespectful and I wish that you could see how much value you have. He's pretending you don't exist to make himself seem available? He's putting others needs in front of you? He's giving attention to other girls and excluding you? No. Just no. Dealbreaker."
"&gt; My husband won't stop blaming me and criticizing my driving and talking about how I screw up all the time. 

I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that this is not a new theme for him. How often does he criticize you?

You deserve a partner who treats you with respect. If he can't do that he shouldn't be your partner."
"  **should I be mad?**   You know you should be mad

 Am I justified feeling so annoyed?  You know you're justified in feeling so annoyed

 Should I really make a big deal of it?  \^"
I think your husband is the normal one.
"Why feel guilty? He said those words, not you. And it's not like you or your girlfriend brought this out in him, this is who he's been all along and you just happen to be finding out the extent of it only now."
"You want to leave but don't, to not fuck up her life, while fucking up your own?    The whole ship is going down.  Save yourself!  Get out!"
This is why I'm also afraid to leave him.. Because I want her to have her money back.
"Ok I'm gonna go out on a limb here and accept the downvotes I'll probably get.... but ... from what i read,  you are ALREADy living together in less than 9 months,  have already had ""past issues"" in this short relationship,  already do counseling,  not that I'm against that,  and you have past trauma.  I think TAKING this internship will be amazing for you,  and a much needed thing.  If your relationship is going to go the distance a short 8 month deployment won't break it and the individually and independence you will gain will be golden.  I think you actually need this challenge to be a better,  fuller,  braver  you."
"&gt;Should I expect her to apologize?

No, you shouldn't expect her to apologize. 

 That would be the mature thing to do. She already showed you that she was immature when she didn't explain to her friends who you were.

That said there is logic behind what happened. (Your sister is now Jane for this) Jane is hanging out with her friends when rando comes by and compliments her hair. 

Her friends see that some rando is hitting on their friend and ignoring them. Plus asking about girl hair styles is not something you will see many guys discussing. So we have her friend as jealous of the attention, weirded out by stranger who is ignoring them, and an arguable effeminate comment and she fires back with that was gay (meaning a girly thing to say for a guy hitting on a girl). 

So then your sister does the easy out of siding with her friends to save her social standing, instead of saying this Is my brother. If she had introduced you she would have knocked her friend down a peg by saying she was mean because she was randomly cruel to her brother.

So now your sister feels bad bc she was mean to you, and now she cant bring you around her friends for awhile, and ""why did my brother even come talk to me like that... all this is his fault. Now he is mad at me that he put me in this situation. He should apologize to me""

I could be wrong, but this 2as the point of view story that I thought of.

&gt;Am I actually being too sensitive/was I too sensitive back in the moment?

No, you are fine. Your sister should have just been more mature and introduced you to her friends. 

&gt;...made me feel bad and she didn't apologize later. What now?

Now you move on and forgive her, forget about it, or let it eat at you till you resolve it."
"I agree with this. A lot of these chores don't need to be done daily or multiple times a day and will likely go unnoticed if OP scales back. OP - reevaluate your chore list and see what can be cut out. On top of that, confront your husband about his unrealistic expectations. If he is relentless you may want to consider couples counseling. My mom was a stay at home mom and like yourself made it her job to keep the house clean and take care of the kids with little help from my dad. She was on top of everything from the cleaning to carting us around to having dinner ready for dad, so I respect your effort and know that it's not easy... it's a full time job in itself! But there is a line and your husband is crossing it with his expectations of bleaching daily and the blinds being set perfectly, etc. If you don't address it now it sounds like it will only get worse."
"This should be a deal breaker for you. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but I've been in this situation and people forcing their religion on you as a condition for being together does not lead to any kind of happy ending. If he can't respect your lack of belief, he's not the man for you in the end. I'm sorry if that's not what you wanted to hear, I've been down that road and it led to heartbreak in the end. 

You respect his religious choice, he doesn't respect yours, that's not a recipe for a successful marriage. And if you had kids, it would get even worse if you weren't on the same page as to their religious upbringing.

You can try counseling but if he's set in stone about this, you may have to break it off."
"It's not your job as a friend to police her hobbies or happiness, no matter how much you may find them vapid and pointless (and believe me, I agree with you). I would worry less about her making herself unhappy (if she truly is, she has to come to this realization on her own), and focus on how it affects the friendship. Set boundaries, like ""hey, when we're out together, could you not be on your phone so much?"" or ""let's talk about something other than Insta! how's X?"" 

If the sheer fact that she only wears three colors annoys you, I would just pull back a bit. Again, I also think it's completely silly, but it's not your or my job to decide how she spends her free time, vacation time, or money--or what she wears. 

Trying to get your friends to change is just pretty futile. Saving them from unhealthy habits is, too. Just be there for her, set boundaries if you want to talk about other things, or pull back a little. That's really all you can do.

Just like anything else (a new relationship, a new hobby), I bet this will die down in any case."
"My best friend and I had been friends for 21 years  and for a variety of reasons both of us had mainly been single during that time or in short lived relationships.

Then I met someone (two people actually because I‚Äôm polyamorous) and this man I thought I knew inside out and who knew me inside out totally changed.

He was gay and became very angry that my new relationship was bisexual but I didn‚Äôt pick up the jibes taking them as questions instead. I went to stay with him because I was worried I was neglecting him now I wasn‚Äôt single and he stiffed me for hundreds of pounds over it and then ghosted me completely.

To me it was completely out of the blue and I was devastated and confused. It was like a break up but now with a bit of distance I see he was right the friendship wasn‚Äôt going to survive the change and in some ways a clean break was better than watching it die in pain. But a decent friend wouldn‚Äôt have ghosted...

Thing was that our friendship was based on loneliness. Misery loved company. We were bonded by nostalgia and feeling unloveable and alone and when one of us turned out to be loveable and in love, it was a threat. 

And I couldn‚Äôt be there for him the same way because I had new priorities. We‚Äôd kind of been surrogate spouses to each other in a weird codependent BFF way and it was a massive rejection when I turned my attention elsewhere.

I felt really guilty letting him down until I realised he wanted me to stay the same for him and not grow and be happy. He wanted me to pick something unhealthy rather than manage his own feelings and share our friendship to work the new stuff out and he wasn‚Äôt happy for me now I was happy for the first time in my entire life.

That isn‚Äôt really friendship and you kind of have to kill that energy hard with ghosting or saying something terrible or a full on betrayal which is what I think is what‚Äôs going on here. Dave is externalising all his feelings about you and his singleness on your GF and using your love for her to punish you for rejecting him.

He knows a low blow like that will hurt you and he wanted to leave you in a cruel way that was hard to forget and damn you don‚Äôt forget a comment like that. He blew it up and left a landmine behind so you can‚Äôt get the real estate back without him haunting it with that comment.

Take some time to grieve the loss of your friendship and all that was associated with it and then realise he gave you a gift because you can diffuse an abandoned bomb but you get drained living with the stress of trying to stop a live bomb going off while you are their friend.

Go and be happy knowing there is no more peril behind and don‚Äôt let him take up space in your head except for the memories you want to keep. Even if you and Safia don‚Äôt work out long term (although I hope you do) you‚Äôll still be better off without Dave‚Äôs conditional friendship."
"Do not tolerate this. He is aware of what she's doing, because if your other friends are aware then he knows what's good too, but he still ignores and disrespects your feelings. This is about respect, and if any girl tried that with man and he just let it slide, I would not be having any of it. Do not tolerate his behaviour."
"I mean, your wife's points aren't wrong.  What kind of planning have you done for this other than wanting to help your friend?  I get that it's a noble thing for you to do, but how's it going to work?  Is he going to pay rent?  Pay for food?  Will he be working?  Can you and your wife afford to support him and your kids?  Does he require personal care related to his condition that you and your wife would be responsible for?  Who is going to pay for him to move across the country?  Have you thought about any of this stuff?  Because it sounds like your wife has started to and it's freaking her out, and rightly so.  You're asking a whole hell of a lot of your wife here and it doesn't sound like you've thought it through very well."
"Going to jump on here in hopes that OP will see it. You may want to see about getting a new phone, as your parents may still be snooping. Any heads up they get about you seeing a lawyer may be bad news as they may try to do something with the funds in anticipation.

Hugs OP, you‚Äôre sound like a strong woman with a good head on your shoulders-you will make it through this."
Thanks for the advice. Looks like it was a local investment company that bought the property. Will be getting in contact with them.
"Yeah, he seemed to just gloss over the ‚Äúfrequent emails with some random guy I‚Äôve never heard of, some of them sexual in nature‚Äù as if that that‚Äôs not a big deal."
"That... sounds like someone who has poor coping skills when dealing with stress and resorts to hurting and abusing those less powerful than him.  

Also, the lack of empathy for a family animal is pretty concerning."
"It might have something to do with what she was doing on her phone. Give her some time, a few hours/a day, then talk to her. You guys sound close. You can probably talk and work through it."
"Lol fucking RIGHT? No apology, no nothing. Just ""I forgive you, so you should forgive me too,"" with no awareness of the fact that OP has NOTHING to be forgiven for. What an ass."
"It really could be anything. Maybe she wanted even numbers with the grooms side and you just didn't make the cut. Maybe she feels like it would be unfair to ask you to commit to the time and cost of being a bridesmaid because you're further away/earn less (I have no idea if these apply to you). Maybe after the brief falling out you had, she's worried the wedding will bring out similar sides of you both and lead to a falling out. Maybe she couldn't afford to pay for another bridesmaid and you were next on the list but finance didn't allow it. Don't assume this is out of malice, it's could be something completely minor.

If it does upset you, I'd talk to her about it. Arrange lunch and bring up the wedding, and bridesmaid, and see if she mentions it. Is there anyone who is close with both of you, that you feel comfortable asking if they know why you weren't included? I don't think you sound bratty or entitled here. Unless we're missing something from the story, it seems really reasonable that you'd be upset by this."
"She's vocalizing that he doesn't take initiative and has to be asked to do household work, he just views it as nagging which is why this leads to divorce."
It's not pathetic. Please don't kick yourself.
"My advice...


Wait a day, send a heartfelt text apologizing, explaining what you said was a genuine joke/banter and that you certainly do not feel that way towards her. Explain you are deeply sorry, apologize for ruining something that was going great and then tell her you completely understand if she wants to part ways and wish her well.


Then wait and see what happens. My guess is, she'll come round."
"Do YOURSELF a favor and break it off. This is un-acceptable. I mean damn, she even pulled the ‚ÄùhE-iS-gAy‚Äù-card. Erase this toxic person from your life."
"The church group leader sounds like a typical sex predator. Takes a position in a religious organization in order to get to young women.
He glares at you, as in his twisted perv mind, you are a competiti√≥n as to the females there. It sound like he trying to groom them.
Please discuss the dangers of ones like him to your gf, mate. Hopefully she understands and spread word to other females there so they are not to be victimized by the pervert man."
"Not trying to assume too much, but I‚Äôm hearing strong hints of:

Narcissist mother

Scapegoat son

Golden child sister (you) in the FOG

If that‚Äôs the case- apologize, do not expect apologies back right now, do not focus on your hurt.

If I‚Äôm wrong, then it‚Äôs unlikely to matter, because the alternative is someone who has allowed themselves to be controlled by their spouse."
"This is something me and my friends have recently had to figure out. About half of my friends practice your system, the other half tracks money pretty seriously and everybody happily pays their part. I like to think about it as 2 styles of paying with friends- formal and informal. Both styles are fine as long as everybody is on board, but when they mix people feel uncomfortable or miffed. It‚Äôs definitely a tough issue to tackle with your BF not seemingly being extremely integrated into the friend group, so he might not actually see fair returns and feeling anxious about that when he‚Äôs used to the formal style of paying friends back is understandable. However, when with your friend group you should probably ask him to tone it down. 

What worked with me (formal) and my GF‚Äôs friend group (informal) was that I never ever pay for anything for the group, but i immediately pay whoever treated the group (always with a small amount extra because it‚Äôs them doing me a favor) or split off and do my own payment when that‚Äôs acceptable. 

In any case, having a no-nonsense conversation about payment anxieties with both the friends and your BF seems the way to go about this, that way everybody could brainstorm solutions that work for everybody without offending."
"This is just the tip of the iceberg. If he's so deep in his parents' pockets on this that he won't even defend a planned vacation, you can expect him not not prioritize you or whatever family you build together.  


Read the red flag."
"&gt; That's how it was in other homes.

This is a different person.   Ask him what role he envisions for you when the baby comes -- does he want you moved to another family, to be come a big brother to the baby, etc 

Ask him."
"I would wager a lot of those fathers that this commenter is referring to would tell you they contribute evenly, and they don't. Look up ""emotional labor"", often in relationships the woman ends up handling not just her job and the kids, but also the majority the day to day stuff. Doctor's appointments, school projects, planning meals and shopping for them, daily clean up and house maintenance, buying clothes and necessities for the keys, keeping up with relatives birthdays/anniversaries and sending cards/gifts as needed, shuttling kids to and from activities, etc.

All of that adds up, and while you can be doing 50% of the chores and paying 50% of the bills, it's still not ""even"". Often women are left with the small day to day stuff. So if you really want this to be an equal partnership, consider all of that.

I know some dads that couldn't even tell you the name of their kid's doctor, or what size clothes and shoes they wear, what their teacher's name is. But they'll still tell you what a great and involved dad they are."
"How is it not an ambush to invite someone over without talking to your girlfriend first? Also you went based off months old conversations about fantasies. You hadn‚Äôt discussed ground rules or limitations.

You were bringing a girl home with you and told your girlfriend ‚ÄúI invited her over to have sex with us. No pressure if you don‚Äôt want to have sex with her.‚Äù

Threesomes can destroy relationships, as you can see, and you really don‚Äôt want to approach them like you‚Äôre impulse buying a shirt because it‚Äôs on sale, just grabbing it cause you thought your girlfriend might like it and it was there.

My advice is to apologize again and never move forward in initiating a threesome again, if your girlfriend wants it she can seek it out with you."
Maybe something happened that made this upsetting? I'd say sorry and ask I'd she doesnt want to do this anymore
"The only reason you're hesitating is because part of the ""values"" yours parents instilled in you include crippling self-doubt and low esteem. Every time you feel ""terrified"" about leaving? Every bit of guilt that comes up? Every worry about abandoning your parents? That's their claws in you. That's their ugly, hateful spite. That's their twisted version of ""values."" 

Every impulse you feel to cut out your own feet for their sake is their training, not rational thought. Take the job, get therapy, and seriously consider cutting contact with them until you unlearn a lifetime of their abuse.

&gt; Has anyone been through anything remotely similar? Do you have any regrets? Do you ever look back and wish you'd decided differently? Any sort of insight or advice would be most appreciated! 

I've known several people with parents who sound nigh-identical to yours. The ONLY happy ones were the ones who cut out their families and moved away. Those who didn't are either miserable - or become miserable copies of their parents."
"&gt; You don't need to vacuum everyday nor bleach the bathroom everyday nor mop the kitchen twice (you can sweep up or just vacuum the crumbs).

How is this the top comment?  The bigger issue here is that be completely controls her and lacks respect for her.  This is no way to live life.  She lives in fear of upsetting him.  That is emotional abuse."
"So, he applied after he convinced you not to go? Knowing that you'd already given it up for him?"
What your wife agreed to was a temporarily sick friend staying over but that has evolved into potential end of life care. Find somewhere where he can get assisted living nearby and help him out that way
"Save for what future? You have no future with this guy. He found someone to pay his bills for him and you fell for it, plus he‚Äôs possibly an alcoholic. 

This is not a ‚Äútiny thing‚Äù. It‚Äôs a huge thing, and if you want to stay with him it‚Äôs time to grow a spine and learn how to say the word ‚Äúno‚Äù and stop giving him so much of your money. 

&gt;He's absolutely lovely in other ways - we both cook for eachother, surprise eachother with gifts, were fiercely loyal, enjoy eachothers company, and he's very considerate.

Very little of this is what makes for a healthy long term relationship. He doesn‚Äôt have your best interests at heart and he‚Äôs fine with taking major advantage of you."
"I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I would straight up call them and tell them they aren‚Äôt coming. Or If they want to see your (for some reason still) husband, then they can do that somewhere else without you. No disrespecting fake ass friends are coming to stay at my house. Sorry not even a little bit sorry."
"I don't think you should move in with him. He needs a serious wake up call about the responsibility of living in his own house. He'll be surprised how messy it gets when his girlfriend isn't there to play maid. Also swapping between  calling it his house and our house is super immature.
Your boyfriend needs to do some serious growing up, so let him."
"Your daughter literally should have no say whatsoever in this. This is life or death and you guys are responsible for her getting the shot on time, etc. I would ignore her complaints 100%."
"So I think there‚Äôs probably a few separate things that could be going on here, and I‚Äôm not entirely sure which, if any, apply to what you‚Äôre feeling. I‚Äôll just make a list and you can check to see if any ring true. (I‚Äôm only gonna give advice on one possibility, because it‚Äôs the one I see most strongly in your letter, but if you want to hear advice on any other ones just let me/other commenters know). (Also on mobile, sorry for shit formatting).

1. You feel like your girlfriend is changing, and that makes you feel uneasy. This could happen with any intense new interest, and is not witchcraft specific.
   1a. You‚Äôre resentful of the time that your girlfriend‚Äôs spending on this, and feel kind of pushed aside in favor of a new hobby.
   1b. You feel like she‚Äôs losing parts of her personality and/or appearance that you were originally drawn to, and gaining or revealing parts that you are not drawn to. Maybe you‚Äôre questioning if you would‚Äôve been attracted to Current-girlfriend when you first started out.
   1c. You don‚Äôt like the people she is friends with or that she admires as a result of this change in interest.
   1d. There are side effects from her practice that destabilize your life in slight but increasingly unpleasant ways (e.g. you don‚Äôt like strong scents, but she‚Äôs started burning sage.)
   1e. She constantly wants to talk about it or have you participate in it, but you‚Äôre not interested and she‚Äôs not taking a hint.

2. You have a philosophical problem with witchcraft specifically, not with the nitty-gritty of her practice.
   2a. The two of you had the same or at least compatible religious beliefs before, and you‚Äôre feeling less comfortable about the future because of incomparable belief systems.
   2b. You‚Äôre worried about her system of values changing... especially when it comes to gender (we‚Äôll get back to that).
   2c. You are embarrassed, and worry about what other people will think, especially if witchcraft is out of the mainstream.
   2d. You‚Äôre worried about how a belief in herbalism will affect her health choices.
   2e. Honestly, you think this is stupid, and you‚Äôre worried that she‚Äôs stupid because she believes in it.
   2f. Honestly, you don‚Äôt get it, and now you‚Äôre worried she thinks you‚Äôre stupid.

Finally, let‚Äôs add a multiplier- if you have kids or are thinking about having kids, it intensifies all of this a LOT. That is important to tell us.

Finally, I just want to make a couple points about the gender thing. No matter what else is going on, I think you‚Äôre definitely concerned about that. Keep in mind, she is not practicing at you. I don‚Äôt think this is about men for her, and I do not think you should take the podcaster‚Äôs discussions of their traumas involving men personally. 

Her witchcraft is not about men, but it may be about women. And I‚Äôm trying to put this well, because you seem a bit sensitive about this subject, but living as a woman in this world is different than living as a man. There are things that she‚Äôs afraid of and things that she has been told about herself that are different than your fears and your narratives. That‚Äôs just how it is. 

Something about witchcraft appeals to her, and if you put a gun to my head and made me decide exactly what, than I‚Äôd say this: it‚Äôs because she gets power over the things she is scared of not in spite of, but because of, the qualities she thought made her weak.

You don‚Äôt have to support her wholeheartedly (heck, you shouldn‚Äôt if some of the things on this list apply), but you should not make this about you. This is about her, and how she feels about this is not a reflection about how she feels about you. I do not think she loves you less because of this."
"Other people have covered (correctly) that this is a perfectly valid reason to break up, but I also want to mention that this woman has displayed several MAJOR red flags.

- You two have only been together six months and already she's pushing to have a baby; in truth, you guys barely know each other and are still in the honeymoon phase, so it would be insane to have a baby now, especially at your age

- She is pressuring you into sexual acts you don't want to do; you should never have to say no more than once and honestly, her persistence makes me nearly 100% certain that she would trap you with a baby at some point if you kept sleeping with her

- She is pressuring you into KIDS you don't want; anyone with even a little maturity understands what a monumentally horrible idea it is to bring kids into the world with someone who actively does not want them and even hates children. The fact that she not only doesn't respect your feelings on this, but is adamant about having a baby its father doesn't want, makes me very afraid for the well-being of any child she has in the future

- Her response to you stating your feelings is manipulative and wildly immature; throwing her food on the floor, really? That's what an actual child does and she thinks she's ready to be a mother?

This woman is not a good partner and this behavior would only escalate over time. You absolutely did the right thing. This isn't just about kids, this is about dating someone who respects your right to say no to things without pressuring and guilting you into getting their way."
"It's very rare on here to see someone respond with empathy and kindness. The fact that he said outright that he knew he was being irrational means he had an element of emotional insecurity, which we can all relate to. Punishing him for opening up is exactly the wrong decision.

What OP should have done is be honest: ""I don't need to think of that because I believe this is all there is."" If there's a religious incompatibility that's a different story, but punishing him for putting you on the spot is backwards thinking."
"Thank you for this! 

I sometimes am unaware of divorce etiquette and decorum since it was so damn abrupt (my parents split) not to mention the fact that I was effectively already an adult providing for myself (out of necessity) due to the sudden shift in responsibility and survival instincts I employed to save myself during that time.  

I appreciate your perspective."
"&gt;remember that grass is greener where you water it.

I like this."
He‚Äôs abusive.  Look.  Boy Friend.  Would a friend treat a friend the way he treats you?   He‚Äôs certainly a little boy but you both have maturing to do.   That‚Äôs natural.   Good luck.
"I guess you can tell on your own that she wasn't overly excited about the idea of having dinner with you.
It took her hours to even respond, and she just told you she doesn't like tacos. I bet she does. Who doesn't like a good taco? And if she truly doesn't, then... You don't need that kind of negativity in your life."
"I am amazed at how many people here seem to think that this is normal, that he can be reasoned with or even suggest counselling. He is abusive and uses this as a means to keep you chained to the house so you and the children can't go anywhere during the day. His expectations are so far from normal that it's frightening.

File for divorce and move in with a friend or a family member with the kids until you find a permanent place to stay. Don't let him know where you are, otherwise he will reel you back in. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life like this and teach your kids that this is the norm?"
"You need to live with your dad. Your mom is so very very abusive, and not just physically but emotionally."
"&gt; it's okay to be self-centered

It's not even self-centered; that still has the a negative connotation which isn't accurate here. This is just self-preservation.

Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."
"That's so true. I just can't understand where this is coming from. I don't even want to look at him right now, much less discuss it with him. I would turn to my girlfriends for advice, but then they would only see him as a cat abuser, I just know it. I figured strangers could give a more objective view."
"Although you intentions were wonderful, unfortunately, your girlfriend will be too uncomfortable in Manila to really enjoy the trip and neither one of you will get any enjoyment out of it. I would say cancel and talk with her about what her ideal getaway would be and start again from there."
"In addition to not mentioning the video until a lawyer has been procured, I would call the side chick. She's obviously not his biggest fan. I'd ask her to hold off on telling him that she has contacted you so that you can get your affairs in order."
"Dude, you are literally doing it right now in this post. You‚Äôre asking redditors to do the work of figuring out what she means and what you need to do when you could just have a conversation with her about it. Planning dates, initiating conversations and phone calls, figuring out logistics of seeing each other- all of that takes time and mental energy, and she‚Äôs sick of spending hers on someone who doesn‚Äôt return the favor. It also makes you look passive, and honestly a passive boyfriend becomes a passive husband, which is a huge source of conflict in a lot of relationships."
"I'd try approaching her first out of concern. ""Hey, you reacted a lot differently than you usually do earlier. Is everything okay?""

And hopefully she opens up. Maybe something traumatic has recently happened to her, maybe she was already upset for other reasons, maybe she just happened to get *actually* scared by that particular prank. After you hear her out, I'd ask her if she wants both of you to cut out the scares (it's not fair to ask you to quit if she's still going to do it), and I'd also point out to her that it was not okay to hit you. Her reaction wasn't acceptable no matter what was going on."
"I'm sorry, but this is totally ridiculous. Your husband sounds fine. I would be livid if my SO of 6 years was questioning my friend choices and sexuality and invading my privacy. You're ruining your marriage here imo by showing your husband how little regard you have for his privacy and that you don't trust him.

This sounds honestly sounds like a self-esteem issue on your end coupled with a bit of homophobia/prudishness (not trying to be harsh, but that's what I'm seeing). I definitely recommend seeking a therapist to talk through some of these insecurities. Also, I think you owe your SO a HUGE apology and need to come clean that you've been invading his privacy. He likely already knows (hence, deleting texts), but you need to tell him either way."
I think your sister is trying to hurt you.
"&gt; Due to situations I don't want to elaborate on, my ex has moved back in with me the last 7 months.

Fuck that, that is ridiculous, don't do that to yourself."
A man that tells you he will leave you and your mutual children over a piece of mail does not love you.
"It IS over the top. I don't think you're overreacting. What would happen if you responded similarly? ""Fine, I'll keep them and you can see them on weekends."" How would he be responding if you were threatening him with custody during arguments? It's totally not appropriate. Would you guys be willing to do counseling? It seems that health issues plus pregnancy issues are compounding the stress and he needs to learn how to not take it out on you."
"&gt;He started by moaning the name of another woman(23)

Eh ok... we can't control our dreams

&gt;he said ""I love you *her name"" to my face with his eyes open

Ok this is getting yikes

&gt;sometimes him not coming back until 3 or 4 in the morning drunk or high

Seems unnecessarily late, but I don't know what kind of gigs they do

&gt;I realize that they have both left the party together

Seriously what??? Why would he not tell you first 

&gt;he was disappointed that I wasn't the one who left the party to go find him

This is somehow your fault now??

&gt;He told me that because I laughed when a male friend of ours tickled me that meant that I was attracted to him (I'm not.)

He is allowed to drunkenly disappear with a female friend but you aren't allowed to give in to an involuntary outburst 

Oh sheesh, this guy sounds absolutely terrible and emotionally abusive. He has double-standards about what's ""allowed"" for you and him, and he can't take any responsibility for his completely inappropriate actions and instead projects it as your fault (for not chasing after him???). It sounds like he's already cheating to be honest. He's only writing you poems and shit because he's realizing that you might seriously leave him. Why didn't this sort of empathy come out when you were upset he left the party with another woman... I feel like he's only upset because he feels like he got caught."
"Thanks for this. He clearly doesn‚Äôt give a crap! I‚Äôm talking to my mum at the moment, I think I‚Äôm going to go home and spend some time with my family and distract myself with that."
"He can‚Äôt just disown your child. He will owe child support, and possibly spousal support too. I am so sorry your husband has chosen to abandon you, but you can access public services and make it through this"
"He is full-on cheating on you, OP. I cannot believe you hugged the girl who just fucked your man. Just dump this chump. He thinks you are dumb."
"One thing I don't like about this subreddit is how everyone seems to think answering these threads means correctly guessing what's going on.

Successfully answering these threads should mean giving guidance to OP on how to find out what's going on.

Making wild potshot guesses on limited information is probably worse than saying nothing at all.

OP, sit your fiancee down and tell her this has been bothering you and that if you're going to be married, there can be no secrets. Ask her to tell you who they were talking about.

If she continues to be cagey or give inconsistent stories even after some time has passed and you've tried to approach this constructively in a calm setting, that's when you should start to pay more attention to her behavior."
"Whenever I hear or read someone say ""My partner has accused me of cheating out of nowhere"" the truth is almost always that the partner is in fact the one who is cheating. 

Glad you figured it out and are now free of the situation. Good luck!"
"If she's that lax with her passwords, she'd be with OP's too.  I wouldn't trust her with them for only that one point."
"Yeah, long private conversations and deleted text logs are pretty big red flags.  The other stuff (speaking up for your cousin, inappropriate jokes with friends) isn't so much a red flag, but I can understand why you're concerned.  Confronting him about it doesn't seem to have helped, so I guess you're going to have to decide for yourself whether you're going to tolerate the probability that he's having an affair, or take the chance of leaving him without being certain that he's been unfaithful."
"She's not your friend. A friend would never denigrate you like that. I think you should avoid her at all costs. Be polite, but never warm."
"Right! So I used to date people who would tell me the ways in which I wasn't enough - scold me because my car wasn't neat enough, lecture me about being a little mischievous, assume that when something went wrong it was because I messed up. I did this because secretly, in some ways, I have some of those opinions about myself. At the very least, I sometimes believe I need fixing, so when I was dating people who would tell me these things, it confirmed for me that I needed fixing, and it felt like help.

It wasn't help. It is controlling, and it doesn't even sound like this guy is ""trying to help."" He's just tearing you down. This is not what significant others are for. People who do this aren't people who are going to be there for you when you need them. You need to feel like your partner is 100 percent there for you, like he respects you and holds you in high esteem, and that your happiness is a priority for him. Both of you need to feel that way about each other. You should NEVER feel like you're walking on eggshells around a partner. This guy is not a partner. He is someone you spend time with who thinks poorly of you, and his contempt will not only destroy your relationship but genuinely take a toll on your relationship with yourself. Get out."
Do you really think that because she‚Äôs better with food it means she wants to do all the work making it all the time?
"Animal rescue is one of my hardest deal breakers. The reason is that there is never ""enough"" animals. There will always be one more that needs a home. So the house is a mess, all the money goes to food and vet bills and your life goes totally to shit. Literally. If she can't give it up, I'd bounce."
"Do not ever go into counseling with an abuser. It hands them the tools to hurt you and the means to burrow even deeper into your life. Please be very clear on something, you should leave him. Not just for your own sake but for your child that will either grow up watching their mum being abused or become a target themselves."
"&gt;he responded 'are you jealous'? I said no, I wasn't, to which he said 'well you should be, she's really hot'.

  
but he *is* trying to make her jealous."
"No one wants to think the worst of their own parents. But you are aware that your mother has lied to your entire family about being the weekday caretaker for this baby. It‚Äôs not a huge stretch to a third party to imagine that she would try to retrieve the baby from daycare, given that she‚Äôs telling everyone that the baby will be under her care. Please take the precaution to have your daycare note that she is not to be given info about your baby or to be permitted to pick him up."
"Sorry, I really do not agree with your sisters advice. The thing is: Your gf is NOT a different person, she is still doing the lying and hiding stuff. And talking about how you are controlling is ridiculous in my opinion. You stated what you are comfortable with. And she broke the trust (one of many times) recently. I personally would really not want to be with someone so wishy-washy about honesty. And the fact she is talking about you being controlling while she f-ed up, tells me sort of that she is not ready to really change"
Just leave it. It is only awkward if you make it awkward. Explaining yourself to her is super awkward....
I'd normally agree with the deleted text logs part but OP metions a couple times she has confronted him over innocent sounding situations. Maybe he got tired of her being suspicious over his friendships.
"She's acting like he DID something. Like, ""look at how well my boyfriend handled this I'm so proud"" he managed to do the bare minimum with a psycho with the whole world telling him he's wrong,

&amp;#x200B;

because he wanted another females attention."
"Would you ever treat your boyfriend like this?

If one of your best friends told you this, would you tell them to stay in this relationship?"
"Yeah I would maybe let this slide ONCE. If there was something really bad happening, okay. But she could at least say something. 

But if she were consistently doing this every time? Yeah, we wouldn‚Äôt be making any more plans."
"There is a lot to unpack here, and it's a bit above reddits pay grade.  You should speak to a sex positive couples counselor before you make any choices you can't take back.

&gt;On a fed up day after too many drinks I sort of broke down, I had so much resentment built up and let fly with it all

Open relationships take strong communication and being willing to have hard conversations *before* the issues fester and expload.  Again, counseling can give you tools to help with this.  Scheduled relationship check in's can be a good idea regardless of whether you pursue non monogamy or not.

&gt; We both feel guilty for not being each others preferred lover 

I would be worried that your wife isn't happy or comfortable with an open relationship, and is just doing it in an attempt to not lose you.  If she is truly completely satisfied with your relationship, feels secure, and is happy for you to go have adventures without her because she wants you to be happy than great!  If it's a reaction to you being frustrated and a last ditch effort to save the relationship, that's not great.

&gt; I have trust issues from every other partner in my life cheating on me(6 total) and my mum cheating on my dad which lead to very bad times as a teenager. 

Do you feel like this would be cheating on her, even if she knows and supports it?  Do you *want* to have encounters with someone else?  Would you still be frustrated that you can't share it with your wife?  It's not uncommon in the BDSM community for there to be some level of open relationships, because kinks rarely line up perfectly so allowances are made for playing with others.  You certainly wouldn't be an outlier if you went that route, but if your wife was unwilling to vouch for you that could hinder your ability to find play partners.  

Basically, you are at the very beginning of this conversation and have a lot to work out still.  It could work out beautifully for you guys, and strengthen your relationship, or it could destroy it.  You clearly aren't happy with the way things are so *something* has to change, I would just advise you to be slow and thoughtful about what that something is."
Found the best friend
"Wait, I don't do drugs. So I had to search. He wants to be on MDMA to fuck the woman pregnant with his child and acts like you're an old scrooge for not wanting it?

Girl..... there are hundreds of flags going off on this demand alone. He's not respecting or listening to you AT ALL. And you're having a baby with him?"
"I think it is wonderful that you are trying so hard to be tactful while trying to help this person grieve. I think you should go to the service. They will know you are going to support them, but you are going to support them. Maybe just squeeze his shoulder and give a small smile. I would view that as an un-intrusive recognition of my grief."
"ADULTS DO NOT GIVE OTHER ADULTS PERMISSION TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. 

Everything you have described is abuse, plain and simple. He is a controlling asshole. You are exhausted from jumping through his ridiculous hoops. There is no way the house requires that level of cleaning, daily. He‚Äôs just trying to keep you exhausted. 

This is not healthy and is not modeling a healthy relationship for your children. 

If you leave, you will literally have more time and freedom to live your life, even if you had primary custody of the kids. 

Let that sink in."
"He gets therapy or you walk.

Period.

Personally, I think its ridiculous that you haven't already walked. He's been emotionally abusing you your entire relationship and you make excuses for him. He's making the choice to be an asshole to you, no one and nothing is forcing him to do that.

He KNOWS he has a problem with his anger and hasn't taken any steps to change it. Just makes you live with it.

Thats not love.

But all you have to say is 'I'm not going to live like this another day. Period."""
It's probably the gran leaving something in the will that he wants
"I would consider reading about enablers. Is it possible that you‚Äôve been enabling your mother‚Äôs bad behavior? 

Things like ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt swaddle the baby‚Äù could be code for  ‚Äúwe gave her specific instructions, she didn‚Äôt do them, undermined our parenting and made us feel unsafe with her babysitting‚Äù , same with things like the dishes. 

If they had a firm boundary with her about doing chores etc and she disregarded them, that can really add up mentally.  You say their both emotional, is your mother the kind to say things like ‚ÄúI raised two children, I know what I‚Äôm doing!‚Äù Because that type of attitude can really cause rifts, especially with new parents 

Honestly even from this post you sound a little like you‚Äôre rug sweeping her behavior. Go have a look at the justno network of subs, they have resources for recognizing things like rocking the boat, rug sweeping ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how she is!‚Äù, the FOG (fear obligation guilt) before you respond.

It is super easy to demonize his wife but honestly she may have had a point, maybe your mother is toxic and your way of ‚Äúpeace keeping‚Äù was really just enabling  your mother to continue to treat your SIL and brother poorly.  Maybe not, but that‚Äôs a pretty common dynamic."
"It sounds to me like he was pretending that you were pressuring him so he could ask his coworker for the money without potentially upsetting their relationship. Like how an employee might say their boss is cracking down on them giving out discounts, when actually they just don't want to give that customer discounts anymore. He has to continue to work with the coworker, so he's making you the ""bad guy"". I would personally be fine with that, but that's up to you."
"Even if I don't bail her out, she'll eventually have her trial and then have nowhere to go after her sentence. What would you do then?"
"Stop waiting for her.  In the future, wait 15 minutes and then go on with your plan (or do something else that makes you happy) without her.

You absolutely shouldn't get together with her 6 hours late because she was to busy smoking (I presume pot) with a friend to fulfill her commitment to you.  Text and tell her you waited 6 hours for her and aren't interested in staying up late to see her.  She can stay at home."
However it could also be:
"&gt; The problem is that working 70 hours a week causes me to easily justify not taking time off to see a therapist (brains are fun lol).

Oh my god, dude. This is *also* a factor to consider when assessing what went wrong in your sex life. With a schedule like that, you‚Äôd barely even *see* your wife. 

I can‚Äôt speak for her, but it‚Äôd be hard for me to feel sexual with a partner I barely see. It‚Äôs an intimacy-killer and severely cuts down on the amount of spontaneity in a relationship. Please bring this up when you go to counseling. I‚Äôd be very surprised if your schedule wasn‚Äôt impacting your sex life in some way."
"""The Politics of Housework"" is another good one.

OP, this is not a ""first world problem."" This is a serious imbalance in the relationship that is directly affecting your quality of work. Have you considered he knows he's inconveniencing you, he just doesn't care? What happens if you two decide to start a family? This doesn't bode well for his ability to be a parent or a partner. 

Honestly I'd look at moving out. You can continue your relationship but he has 4 things to do. 4. You do everything else.

Words are cheap- actions show you he cares. It is not your job to be his parent and he is putting you in that position by refusing to be an adult."
"So other than being judgemental,  pedantic, unable to stand not winning an argument and blowing up at you he's fine? 

So basically if you do what he says,  don't talk and have no opinions that aren't vetted by him and certainly never do anything that makes him lose his temper he's fine? 

Op....  These aren't signs of a good person..."
"This is painful to read, thank you for sharing from the heart. You are right - love isn't enough. I love him so, so, so much. He is the love of my life. But I need respect, and empathy, and nurturing, and thoughtfulness. And I need to know with 100% certainty that he can be there for that. Not 90% certainty, not 97%. 100%. I can't keep being let down by his thoughtlessness. 

I hope things get better for you. It's so hard."
"The sister is one shit ass therapist. Wow. 

‚ÄúSure she lied to you over and over and OVER but I have divined from _______ that she probably didn‚Äôt fuck her. You should go back.  What?  You have feelings too?  Fuck your feelings about being lied to. PS I‚Äôm not unbiased since I know and like this girl‚Äù"
"In the words of the great L.L. Cool J, ""you got played, here lemme show ya'."""
"That just sounds like having a friend, again. Just because you can't do something with your partner, doesn't mean you can't do it with anyone else."
"Or watch a stand up special by Daniel Sloss called Jigsaw on netflix. Really well written and also on a similar topic.

But only if you like dark humor, I guess but I don‚Äôt even think it is that dark."
It sounds like your his slave. That‚Äôs not a normal relationship.
"I can see why your brother had/has issues with you.  You paint your mother as a rational actor, and your brother/SIL as irrational and immature.  Everything in your comment screams invalidation of their perspective.  They rightly see you as your mother's cheerleader, and not as a neutral third party.

If you do apologize, make sure it's genuine.  Not a ""I'm sorry you were hurt,"" or ""I'm sorry that whatever I did made you feel bad.""  Look up the six parts of a genuine apology and follow it.  If you can't muster a genuine apology and still feel justified in your behaviour, then don't bother with one.  Your brother will see it for the BS it is."
"It's called impostor syndrome from the sounds of it. Read up on it and it may help you understand what you're feeling.

In my current job I have felt this very keenly working with guys who have 20+ years experience on me. But they invited me to be on the team I work with and I am lucky to be there.

It can be hard to overcome but trust me if you've got the skills you will do just fine."
This is what I was thinking lol
"You should be scared. He‚Äôs basically rejecting most of what makes you who you are. Why on earth is he marrying a performer if he doesn‚Äôt respect performing or enjoy your performances? He won‚Äôt even go see you!

Now imagine that you marry this turd and have a child who wants to be an actor or singer. How is that kid going to feel when Daddy rejects them?"
"So your boyfriend took advantage of the fact that you were a vulnerable, homeless teenager to prey on you, and now he demeans and abuses you. He pressured you into sex you didn't want. I am so sorry, OP. This man stole years of your life from you. 

Go to thehotline dot org or call the national domestic violence hotline at 1-800-799-7233. They can help you figure out how to get yourself out of this situation. They can help you find a shelter to stay in until you can get housing. You deserve so much better than this piece of shit, OP."
"I'd wager she's going through some personal drama and you interrupted that.  She reacted poorly.

That said, the 'game' that you're playing with your sister makes it seem that something like this was inevitable.  Eventually one of you was going to catch the other at a bad time, resulting in the other person lashing out.  You should definitely take a break from this game, and maybe even table it for good.

One other thing to bear in mind here is that you're at something of a precarious age.  Sixteen is right around the age when male physical development can begin to significantly outpace female physical development in terms of putting on size, weight, and muscle.  A game like this might have been fun if you two were roughly the same size, but if all of a sudden you have an extra 6"" of height and 50 lbs of weight on her, your 'surprises' will be much more threatening.  Sixteen can also be the age where women start being more aware about the dangers they can be put in by ill-intentioned men that are physically larger than them."
"You‚Äôve asked, begged, pleaded and there has been zero progress.  It would be foolish to think you‚Äôll ever get a different result.

Just dump him.  His pedantic criticism of your dumping soeech will be the last one you have to endure."
"Give them a picture, just to be sure."
"I think that you should tackle this from a financial angle. Sit her down and ask her point blank, how much money she feels is appropriate to spend on a wedding. Then take that number and figure out what that means for your financial future. Offer a compromise that allows some extravagance, but also allows you to be fiscally responsible.

Some thoughts on weddings.

First, there is a whole industry vested in making wedding a lot more expensive than they actually need to be. DO NOT buy into that bullshit. You don't need 20 brides maids. You don't need half the shit they push on us.

Second, a wedding ceremony is ultimately a public announcement of the couples love for each other. Having people there to witness the union is a good thing. Ideally, the audience should be people you hold near and dear: family and close friends.

It is possible to put together a very tasteful wedding that is beautiful and heart warming without going overboard. Work with her to figure out a way to do that."
"So your BF couldn't be alone for 5 days without seeking validation from strangers?

And somehow this is *your* fault? Sometimes people cry when they hear criticism. If he can't handle some tears, he's not ready to deal with another person's feelings and emotions.

Relationships should not make you feel insecure, make you second guess yourself, limit your opportunities (especially at 21), or generally be a struggle. He knew he was doing something wrong, he got caught and he's still putting some of the blame on you.

What is *he* doing with himself that your working 4 days a week to meet your expenses is too much for him?

He's not ready for a relationship. He's not done yet."
My favorite response...equally as important to respecting Op‚Äôs sister‚Äôs professionalism is a statement about not being an annoying pain in the ass over sports fandom.
"Exactly. I mean, how did he actually ""handle"" this situation? Let's see...

- First, per the original post, he emotionally cheated on OP, hid his convos with this other woman from OP, and generally prioritized this other woman above OP and their relationship
- When OP confronted him, he completely dismissed her concerns, and didn't put up any boundaries whatsoever with this woman who's clearly interested in
- When OP showed him the overwhelming advice from the first thread, he *still* dismissed her concerns, and refused to listen to anything she said
- Then, he **went and complained about OP's concerns to his mother**, apparently expecting her enable his disrespectful behavior
- Even when his own mother told him he was wrong, he only ""started to think"" was right. ""*Started* to think"". Holy hell.
- It took the other woman *telling him to his face that she wanted to make OP jealous*, for him to finally believe OP. And even then, he still hasn't blocked her! He's still just waiting for her to naturally leave the friend group next month, because he's too spineless to stand up for OP or their relationship in any way whatsoever!

Literally the only step he's taken is *to respond in less words than normal*. He still talks to this woman! He just responds slightly less.

OP's normality meter is extremely out of whack, if she thinks this is ""snowballing in all the right ways"". This was weeks of effort to get him to budge an inch. That's a terrible foundation for a relationship."
"To add on this excellent advice:

1: put sister and the rest of the family on an information diet until further notice in case telling sis anything is leaking back to mom. This shuts down second hand info that causes you to JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) which traps you in circular and draining discourse.

2: Write to them about daycare and screenshot or save the evidence. If you can also drop this info into a family Whatsapp group so everyone sees it so your mom can't say one thing and not another.

3. But don't tell anyone of them which daycare and state the subject is closed. Make sure ALL family members and your mom's friends and nosey neighbours aren't on the pick up list. Implement a pick up protocol with daycare where all approved pick up people have to know a specific word (a baby safeword basically) as double security. This is quite a common thing in cases of abuse and shared custody etc. The daycare won't think any of it.

4: set boundaries, make them clear and never ever break them. Not even when Great Aunty Helen says she's dying and her last wish is to see baby Percival along with her favourite niece Crazy Mom. Not when your mom cries and says you must hate her and she might as well divorce your dad and just do you all a favour and disappear. Not when your dad asks. Any chink of your armour and you are on the back foot.

5. Consider a camera doorbell in case she starts ambushing the house. 'Oh you were asleep so much, I got worried you were sick an brought soup an that's why I'm in the living room uninvited'. And if you have a spare key hidden, unhide it.

6. Don't assume she'll take a hint. If wishes were horses with your mom, you'd have a field of ponies by now because I doubt she started all this behaviour when you announced the baby. She's been a Just No Mom for years but you ae just noticing it more now you have your own kid and don't want him exposed to it."
"Your therapist encouraging you to repress your very valid anger is disturbing. I would get another therapist.

You are well within your means to make your husband tell these friends to cancel, or to never want to see them again."
"So your boyfriend should be on the hook for the deductible. It occurred while in his care and it's his fault the insurance info was lost. That's 100% his bill. 

In the future I would also expect him to pay for any parking tickets accrued by him - this includes any time he chooses not to move the car when it needs to be moved. I wouldn't move it yself, just have him pay the ticket and not share the car until it was aid. 

He's not being reasonable. You dont have to worry about what's equitable or fair, this is your car and if he wants to use it he needs to meet your terms. Decide what you feel is fair (he pays for gas and oil, you pay for insurance andpayments, whatever that looks like), and if he refuses, then he refuses."
"Why would she respect you when you don't even respect yourself? It's not like she was running a bit late and then showed up, or even that she cancelled. She deliberately kept dangling ""soon"" in front of you, so you couldn't even make other plans. She WANTED to keep you waiting all afternoon and evening. It's a power move. She's a jerk. She's laughing with her friend about she's kept you waiting for over SIX hours, and that you're so pathetic that you just accept it, even with her lame excuses like sleeping late, suddenly deciding to talk to her advisor about a non-urgent matter, then smoke some weed, then a friend's imaginary crisis, and you're just like ""Derp, okay honey, see you soon."" I wonder what her next postponement excuse will be. Can't wait to hear it, and how you just take it like a chump."
"Thank you dearly for this,

&amp;#x200B;

For me to exclude so many details but for you to still **get** it is something that I truly appreciate. Even while so many of my other sibling have effectively been coerced into accepting this blended family dynamic, I would be lying if I said constantly having to ""play dumb"" and ignore the elephant in the room doesn't get to me.  


The final straw was my Dad selling our family home last summer from beneath my Mother leaving her homeless. I spent **thousands** of my own money running the lights, water, and getting her food while she squatted to avoid the harsh elements during the summer and winter and meanwhile over at his house is the glutenous display that lying to your family for years can afford you."
"It doesn‚Äôt feel like gaslighting. It‚Äôs a bizarre power play by someone with some strong ‚ÄúNiceGuy‚Äù personality traits. It feels like he‚Äôs trying to somehow make OP feel like he could have any other hot girl so she should appreciate him.  It‚Äôs super cringe. 

For just a 6 month relationship I‚Äôd bounce. Honestly. This is shit I‚Äôd expect from a 13 year old kid who has no idea how to behave in a relationship. It‚Äôs not worth sticking around waiting for an adult to unfuck his behavior."
It sounds like you guys have a toxic relationship and he‚Äôs trying to work up the courage to leave by seeing how bumble probably tinder also.  It sounds like you guys have been done for awhile though maybe this cry for help is a sign to start making plans to move apart because it looks like he is beginning to make his own moves.

"&gt;I just have this irrational urge for there to be some type of reckoning where they are shamed for the pain that they caused me.

What is the pain they caused you?

That's not a trick question. It makes sense that having someone break up with you feels bad, but as you acknowledge, no one involved has done anything ""wrong"". Can you describe the pain you've felt about this, separate from any wrong that was done to you?

It comes off (to my non-professional eye) like you're having trouble separating ""I feel bad about this"" from ""the other people involved *made me* feel bad"", and therefore you want some kind of *justice* for a situation where no one did anything wrong. It's gotten to the point where you imagine other people congratulating friends on something as happy as their engagement are actually thinking about how much you suck and have been wronged. They're absolutely not, I'm quite sure of it. Perhaps you might try talking to your therapist about finding ways to work through negative feelings without making them anyone else's *fault*.

In the meantime, just... don't be an asshole? Smile and nod when the news comes up and then change the topic. Block the couple on anything you don't already have them blocked on, mute posts and conversations about the wedding, so that you're not tempted to poke at an open wound. Consider sending a neutral card or gift on the level that you would for a not-particularly-close acquaintance. Imagine that these were just a couple of people you don't know all that well but are generally positively inclined towards. Act like you would in that situation. It'll feel better than wallowing and it'll avoid creating weirdness in your social circles."
"Actually the Chief Executive Officer of Africa is the one who decides these things, but shareholders also get a role as figureheads. She just happens to think her measly five shares makes her special."
"It sounds like you shouldn't date people who take drugs.  You're clearly uncomfortable with it for very good reasons.

Taking shrooms literally once a year doesn't seem like drug abuse to me.  It's 100% OK to set a rule for yourself that you will only be in a drug free relationship but your GF's behavior doesn't throw up red flags to me."
"&gt; He is the love of my life.

He only holds this position because you invested so much time and energy in him. You're young enough to find a new partner to invest in who will, sure enough, become the new love of your life, or even new friends who will reciprocate the love you show them."
The objective view is exactly that. He is an animal abuser.
Nope. This guy sounds like the unreasonable and crazy one and it sounds like you dodged a bullet.
"This right here. This has happened to me before. Especially the fact that he is a mature man. 

Let's say his parents approved and you guys married. You might find your mother-in-law and father-in-law interfering in your relationship. That likely wouldn't feel good."
"Everyone here telling you to tell her to knock it off or you'll go to HR is giving shit advice.  You have already told her to leave you alone.  You need to go to HR.  If you threaten her with HR, she's going to go first and say you're harassing her.  

I might consider saying once - in writing - something like, ""I am not romantically interested in you and prefer to keep our relationship professional.  Thanks for understanding.""  But document, document, document."
He had already submitted his application when you withdrew yours. So wouldn't you have been with him if you both got in?
This guy survives High School.
"He lost whatever standing he had to criticize you when he left it to you to plan your own Mother‚Äôs Day. Jesus Christ. 

The general rule is, if you delegate a task to your partner, you don‚Äôt get to nitpick how they do it, as long as it gets done and nothing burns down in the process. If your husband is too anxious to back off, that‚Äôs a problem he needs to address himself, because it *will* drive both of you nuts and damage the trust in your marriage. He needs to treat you like a competent adult and trust that you‚Äôll fix any mistakes you make yourself. 

Kids grab hot pans. Items get forgotten at the store. Cleanup get left til after dinner. Unless he wants to take over 100% of the childcare and shopping and cooking and cleaning, he needs to accept that they will not always be done the way he thinks they should, and that he (presumably) wouldn‚Äôt have married someone who couldn‚Äôt handle these things on her own. If he truly can‚Äôt wrap his head around the idea that his partner doesn‚Äôt need to be micromanaged, it‚Äôs time to bring in a professional to mediate this issue before it wrecks your relationship."
Animal hoarding is a real thing. Using rescuing makes it seem justifiable. If it‚Äôs ruining your life then something has to give.  I would sit her down and tell her how unhappy this is making you. No judgement or telling her how wrong she is. Just tell her that you are stressed out all the time and that it has to change. If she‚Äôs not open to hearing that then it‚Äôs time to tell her to choose. You or the animals. It sucks if it has to be that way but I can‚Äôt imagine living in a house with so many animals. It would start to smell really bad
"OP, let your mom be upset. If he really wanted to rebuild a relationship with you, where is he in all this? Has he ever come to you and apologized for his past behavior? No. Has he ever treated you with respect? No. Like, why is your mom being his messenger if he wants a relationship with you? 

You can't make your mom happy here without sacrificing your own happiness and mental well-being. Personally, I wouldn't sacrifice that to force a relationship with someone who clearly doesn't respect you."
"Right? Like instead of googling 'emotional labor' and educating himself, he's asking to be spoonfed."
Ok... I‚Äôm NOT an advocate of ghosting someone but you may have to send a message that is short and to the point ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no longer interested and just don‚Äôt want anymore communication‚Äù. Then block him and disappear
"Sounds like he took a swing at your self esteem on purpose. 

""He said that I know myself that I am not beautiful""

So it's important to him that you also don't find yourself attractive?"
Honestly. I suspect he‚Äôs  not been third wheeling Jane and his brother during these trips with them and I doubt this was the first time tine Jane brought some of her female friends to them.
He doesn‚Äôt care about a secure future with you.  If he did you wouldn‚Äôt have these issues.
"This isn't really your problem to fix, though. It sounds like this is primarily an issue between John and your parents. And there is nothing your parents can do that will make up for years and years of John realizing that your parents didn't truly see him as their son. That's a heavy burden for him to carry.

It sounds like John had made some amount of peace with the situation, which is now jeopardized by your sister having told your parents and your parents' reactions. But--that's not really your problem to fix either. That's between John and your sister, and John and your parents, and maybe your sister and your parents too.

You're 23 years old. For the last five years John's been making an effort to develop relationships with his siblings that don't involve your parents. If you want a relationship with him, meet him halfway on that. Ask **him** out to dinner for a change. Don't make the visit about his relationship with your parents, ask him about himself, and how he is doing. Don't report back to your parents beyond a general ""yeah he's doing well and asked about you"", if he's comfortable with that. 

Obviously I wasn't there, but John was, and he has a right to feel however he feels about his experience growing up. You might have had a very different experience growing up in the same household with the same parents. That's okay, life sometimes works out that way."
"Maybe it's just where I live, but your neighbors sounds kind of nosy.  Yea I too would be taken aback by someone asking to move the moving truck so they can have their favorite super special spot. I assume your girlfriend parks in the closest available spot to your home, like every other person in the world without assigned spots. What makes this neighborhood so different? 

Maybe if James didn't want to get into a confrontation, he shouldn't be confronting suspected tresspassers. He should have called the cops and move on."
"Thats terrible to think about. She is lying on my stomach right now and purring up a storm, I can't even breathe thinking about someome hurting her like that. And I have to think of my son, he is only a baby (well, three, but he is my baby!) and he doesn't even have claws to defend himself. I have never felt the mixture of fear, anger and digust like I did when I caught him, and I don't know how I didn't see it earlier."

"So, people are saying be honest in order to get out of it but I completely understand the desire to not say, ""hey. no. not interested in you life that. not coming over."" 

Women routinely get insulted, harassed, blackballed, and killed over rejecting men. Those are all things we would like to avoid, regardless of if we think this particular person is capable. 

That being said, **you** **don't want to go so DON'T GO**. Don't do something you don't want to do just for the sake of politeness. 

I'd text him, tell him a personal/family emergency has come up, or you've gotten sick (think: food poisoning) and will not be able to make it. Apologize for it being last minute, and leave it at that. 

If he attempts to reschedule the next time you see each other, tell him you are extremely busy with with things moving related."
"I cannot stress enough how much I relate to what you have just said here. I still love him, but I love myself more (thank god!)"
"&gt; I don't want him to have a baby. I want him to want me instead.
&gt;
&gt;How do I get him to adopt me? How do I convince him I'm better than a baby?

You have to accept that he is having a baby whether he adopts you or not. He has made it clear that this is happening and its beyond the stage where he can call it off easily. There is no situation where it stays just you and him. Which sucks for you but you have to accept that.

What is your family situation? Are you free to be adopted? If you have biological family who might still have rights to you, he might not be able to adopt you even if he wanted. If you're free to be adopted, you need to talk to him and let him know what youd like. I'm sure it would mean a lot to him. It's a positive sign that he kept fostering you after the divorce."
"&gt;He's now being faced with the uncomfortable reality that he is dating someone who could be his daughter, and he doesn't like it.

Ding ding ding"
"You're both wrong.

She's wrong to be dishonest, to lie over and over again, and to basically, defend her right to lie to you.

You're wrong because you keep imagining there is a sane response to this behavior and belief besides, You should break up.

When someone lies repeatedly, and also continues to defend their right to lie to you and constantly refuses to acknowledge the emotional impact on you of these lies, you should break up. 

She has communicated clearly that she will not honor boundaries, will not be honest about her disagreement with your boundaries, and has told you she doesn't have the same outlook as you do on monogamy. 

To pretend there is a compromise or reconciliation available here is, is to refuse to hear and believe her plainly said words. 

Fortunately, you can easily become 'right' in this situation by ending the relationship. That is far, far more likely than her suddenly deciding to be honest despite her ongoing insistence she doesn't owe that to you."
"Tell him that your comfort in this relationship is just as important as his. Tell him the truth- that you have been worried about trying to come up with a ‚Äòvalid‚Äô argument to please him, when you feeling uncomfortable with it IS A VALID ARGUMENT. Suggest you go and pick out some art together or even take some of your own shots. If he insists on putting them up, he‚Äôs valuing 2 stupid bits of paper/canvas over your feelings so fuck that guy. You are not childish and your feelings are completely valid, its WEIRD that he wants to hang them up. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he has feelings for his ex but it‚Äôs weird and odd. If he loves you and respects you he will accept your simple request for what it is, if he doesnt then get rid of him. Good luck!"
"He's:

* a decade older than you
* controlling
* full of irrational sexual jealousy which he makes into YOUR problem instead of getting his shit together
* punishing you with a week of no contact so that you won't disobey him next time

This fucking clown seriously thinks you are obligated to have hairy legs at the beach so other men won't think you look hot??? What an immature, insecure loser. You want to shave your legs, shave your legs. Your body doesn't belong to him. I think you should tell him to fuck off."
"Yea tbh that‚Äôs the whole vibe I got while reading this. He def needs to be cut off tho, feelings or not."
"I can't link it, but read the article, ""She Divorced Me Because I Left My Dishes By The Sink,"" then send it to him.

"&gt; Your grandfather hurt someone you love, which is an even harder thing to forgive than harm to yourself. 

Thank you for putting this into words. My paternal grandparents were (and tbh, still are) abusive to my dad and aunt when they were growing up. My dad still maintains a relationship with them and he has been pressing me more lately about why I don't return their calls. You've clarified my feelings so hopefully I can convey that to him next time we discuss it."
"So, your self-esteem is shredded.

Go to therapy.  If time/availability/cost is an issue, go to Captain Awkward and search for ""low cost mental health.""

Your husband has contempt for you.  You are the dumping ground for this contempt.  I will guess that you were the scapegoat growing up, the reason anything ever went wrong?  You were blamed for everything, including the actions of other people?  You were never good enough--you were stupid and thoughtless and maybe even a little malicious?

How often did you make a mistake and be accused by a parent of ""doing it deliberately?""  Does your husband do the same thing, insist that your mistakes are basically the result of spite--maybe you did something deliberately just ""to rile him up?""

Your first step, the crucial step, the most important step in your life, is *to get therapy.*  Once you realize that you deserve respect, the other crucial step--dumping this asshole--will come into focus.

Therapy.  Please."
"&gt;""I dont know whats going on between you guys but I want MY niece for a sleepover."" 

Hahahahahahaha!

Your not-SIL, whom you have never met, DEMANDED your newborn for a sleepover. 

That's actually pretty funny. With how ridiculous that is. And she's 30 years old. And she's made extremely stupid, weak (but dangerous) threats. 

I don't think you can be with BF right now with how he's allowing his mother and sister to manipulate him and how his sister has abused you. But do what you want with him. With his sister, she has to be blocked *everywhere* with you, no contact with your child (or the elder one), no BF sneaking around with your child to meet her. 

She literally, for no reason, in a text, said she HATES you. Take this crazy seriously, even if BF doesn't. Protect your kids. Protect yourself. You will need a lawyer or to do mediation with BF. 

And she'll see you in court?? Bwahahaha...that one court where people get custody of their brother's children they have never laid eyes when no abuse or neglect is going on? She is delusional."
"Every single comment you have made sounds exactly like the parents and siblings people talk about, and post correspondance with, in r/raisedbynarcissists and I can 100% see why your brother cut you out.

You are making yourself out to be the best sister, the best daughter, the almighty peacemaker. The nice one who did no wrong expect for when she was provoked by being cut out of someone's life and was hurt. What you are is a flying monkey.

All of your posts are about people having issues and you trying to solve them and doing no wrong. Stop. You are not God. You are not a peacekeeper. You can not control anyone's feelings or actions other than your own. 

If you actually want a relationship with your brother you need to keep your mother out of it. 100% out of it. And you need to not continue trying to make things right between him and your mother because that is likely what pushed him away from you in the first place."
"The more time you spend in the wrong relationship means all that much less time you have to enjoy the right one. Wash your hands of this girl, my friend - the tax on your emotional well being isn‚Äôt worth it."
"Nope. You did the right thing. Kids are the ultimate dealbreaker and they're not something you can compromise on. Trust me, you did the best thing for both of you. Why would she want to bring kids into the world with a parent who doesn't want them and would resent both her and the kid?"
Staying longer won‚Äôt make it any easier. Tell him he‚Äôs wonderful but it‚Äôs time to move on - then bolt.
"Even if your wife is going through things, that doesn't mean you should just bury any issues or concerns within your relationship. This sounds like it's been bothering you for a very long time and you guys have not really been able to have an open and honest conversation about it. Your wife seems like she's not expressing how she's really feeling about physical intimacy and why she's been kind of closed off about it, whether it's because she doesn't want to talk about it, or that she just doesn't know why. I know you mentioned getting her to see a therapist hasn't worked so far, but would you both consider couple's counseling?  While she really should seek individual therapy, couple's counseling can help with this issue and she may be more comfortable with that knowing she's not alone in it."
"He's been like this since day one of your relationship. He will not commit to you. He's been keeping the doors open for three years. Think about that, he has not had his attention solely on you in the entirety of your relationship... Find a man who will make you his whole world."

"Yea, you say he is your biggest supporter,  but that bar must be pretty low because:

&gt;He's better now than he was - but the bulk of housework, emotional labor, running the house, managing our pets' care, etc. still falls to me. 

He doesn't support your time. 

&gt;He said ""I'm just not interested in the stuff you are."" He doesn't ask about my day, or what I did, or anything.  

He doesn't support your interests or wellbeing. 

&gt;We moved a few years ago to the middle of nowhere and there are NO jobs here. 

He doesn't support your career ambitions.

&gt;I have holes in my sneakers and my bras are 4 years old and have holes in them. Every time I have a household need or I need clothing, even a $15 bra, we have NO money. But he has a new truck, a new shed, a workshop full of new power tools and accessories, and he's been going out for steak dinners and drinks weekly. 

He doesn't support you looking or feeling your best. He doesn't support you financially. In fact, he denies your basic needs (clothing) to support his completely superfluous wants (big boy toys)

&gt;He has criticized and nitpicked things I love. 

He doesn't support your self-confidence. 

&gt;The worst is the lack of trust. He makes poor decisions. 

He doesn't respect your judgement or intelligence,  even after being shown evidence again and again that you deserve to be listened to. 

&gt;I love this man. I love him so much. I am beyond shattered at the thought of leaving. It's unbearable. But if I had left 6 months ago, I would have been better off. And all I can think is ""How will his thoughtlessness hurt me 6 months from now?""

6 months from now, you can be receiving alimony payments and living in your own apartment in a city with a job and opportunities ahead of you. You will be in control of your own life and your future.  You can be free of the anxiety and disappointment of living with this man. 

Good luck girl."
"OP, I want to second this comment because my husband is this way and it's the first thing I thought of when I read your boyfriend's remarks. It sounds to me like he finds you physically attractive in such a way that falls into the ""pretty"" or ""cute"" categories rather than the ""sexy"" category.

(By the way, I am small chested too, and over the course of our marriage, my husband, who was initially all about voluptuous blondes, seems to have developed a fondness for brunettes with more athletic figures...when someone loves you for who you are, as it sounds like your boyfriend does, it can cause their preferences to evolve. Please don't start hating your small chest just because he said once he prefers big boobs...pretty sure when it comes down to it, he just prefers *you*. And if you have typically felt that your figure is gorgeous, that's wonderful and something to hold on to no matter what anyone else thinks!)"
"I agree with this - OP it‚Äôs great your fianc√© has finally realised what you were saying is correct, but I think you need to speak with him about why it took for his mum to say something to realise you were right. Why did your comments get disregarded?"

"Incredibly well-put. Not sure why hearing a stranger on the internet tell me it's okay to be self-centered here makes a difference to my conscience, but it really does.

But turning my life upside down to prevent that doesn't feel great either."
"Why don't you Google ""emotional labor"" and ""mental load"" and read up a bit? Googling ""metafilter emotional labor"" to find a document with lots of information. 

It seems pretty clear she wants you to plan things , reach out, initiate. Relationships actually involve a lot of work to stay healthy."
"Not to mention, based on his edits (e.g., about having a complex schedule and kids), I'm guessing he's probably the type who's always saying ""no"" to things as well.

It's frustrating enough to always have to be the one initiating in a relationship, even when the other person always says, ""yes.""  But it's downright miserable if you have to always initiate and your partner has a high chance of saying ""no"" to things.

I've dated guys like this, and it puts you in a bind.  If he's so busy and picky about times he's available, he really needs to initiate things and plan them for when it works for him.  But he's not going to do that, so if I don't do anything, the relationship just withers (from no one initiating anything)."
"Given his age and the fact that he is on dialysis, it is most likely he is declining mentally and would benefit from additional home care to help him maintain his quality of life.  

Would he be OK with you attending his next Dr's appointment with him, and you can possibly share your concerns?

If that is not an option, does he have family you can reach out to?  Or if all else fails, contact social services and express your concern that your housemate maybe in need of additional daily assistance."
"Please google the study that says single moms (even with primary custody!) spend less time on chores than married moms.
You heard that right! That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have to clean up after a spouse, and because they decide on their own schedules. 

You are NOT disposable. You are doing incredibly valuable labour (the cooking, cleaning, driving, organizing that allows spouses and children to LIVE) that many feminists have been arguing for decades should be paid. And indeed, when it‚Äôs not the wife who does it, those services are expensive!

You are making daily life possible and it is a very important job. If your husband continues to humiliate you about it, I guarantee you will be happier, freer, and have better self-esteem without him. You would even have money for child support! (Which it is absolutely INSANE he doesn‚Äôt cover now. Is this his daughter or not?)"
This is some Cinderella shit right here. You can't go to the ball until you've scrubbed all the floors? SIS. He does not own you! You don't have to do what he says!

Yeah, and this is a huge issue. You need to postpone this wedding and start couple's counseling now. There's already resentment on both sides, and if you don't talk this through now and get on the same page, this resentment will just continue growing"
"Do you really have memory problems? Or do you just have a perfectly normal memory where from time to time you forget things and your husband blows it up into an enormous incident and gaslights you into thinking you have some sort of systemic issue?

"In fact, you may what be what convinced him to have a baby.

If he didn't like having you as a kid, he probably wouldn't want to have another one."
This is soooo disrespectful. I would be PISSED.
"If he's pretending not to understand it's a double standard, while guilt tripping and making accusations etc, well that's gaslighting and a form of abuse. 

The accusations might be because he's been cheating, but it could also just be part of his system of controlling behaviour, making her feel like she's untrustworthy. They've been together a long time too, I wonder when this started."
"Dreams: meh whatever.

So what exactly is being in a relationship with this woman adding to your life? She doesn't seem to meet any one of your needs.
"My advice is to keep things light, but let him know that you have some things you'd like to apologize for if he's in a place where he wants to hear those apologies.

"Block him on EVERYTHING. Cut all ties. Tell him you‚Äôre not interested in being his property and never see him again. This is not someone you want to get involved with.

have you told her your sex drive is pretty low right now and you just don't really want to have sex?
"What about his statement upset you? He voiced something you already know. He didn't do it in a cruel manner, he didn't tell you that he thought you being fat makes you ugly or a lesser person. He stated something that you already knew and this upset you, you need to work out why.¬π

Being overweight is an incredibly hard topic to talk about, and nine times out of ten it doesn't need to be talked about. But, when it does it should be discussed in the way your partner did it, it's a factual statement that isn't a judgement on you, and it is about a health concern. 

Do you view being fat as a negative outside of health? Do you see it as a failing? You said you've lost weight before but gained it back when your mental health slipped, do you see being fat as physical reminder that you failed, that you're not okay right now?"
"She's plainly telling you she wants you to initiate and you're essentially not believing her by saying ""yeah but I think she doesn't actually like it"".

She's a grown woman telling you her wants and needs. Listen to her. Look up stuff you're not sure about. And then take action instead of standing around wringing your hands about it."
I think it perfectly normal to feel shocked and sad but remember that this is in no way your fault and you should not feel guilty. He is going to have to face the consequences of his actions and if you feel like you need to process your emotions you can reach out to your friends and family  for support.
Get. Him. Fired. Make a ruckus. The *only* way men like him will change is if our society starts holding them accountable.
"Maybe he doesn't want to feel like a burden and that's why, like as a payback, he cleans everything... Or he actually does it to keep himself busy.
You could just ask him yourself?"
"I'm confused. This isn't about ""our"" friends becoming ""his"" friends. I was expecting a post where he is always getting invitations to hang out. They just randomly started insulting you to your boyfriend's face?


These are people just talking shit about you. And I'm confused about why. Were they just complaining and getting upset that you stopped hanging out and felt abandoned? Or were they actually ""talking shit"" and making up lies about you. If it's the latter, they don't sound like friends to you, and your boyfriend should reconsider the friendship, too. 



If it's the former, just say you were going through some health things, you wish you'd seen them more, and you want to hang out more. 



Either way, work on your depression with a therapist, and work on branching out socially. Join a club, go to meetups, etc."
"I don't think this is the case.

I'm wondering if OP's friend relies heavily on OP for his social life. If these 2 are as close as OP says, I think he might feel that it's a threat to his lifestyle if OP is in a relationship and naturally isn't as socially available as he would be as a single man. 
Obviously it's wrong to be like that but could explain his jealous behaviour."
"Nicole is an awful person. Do not be friends with her.

But you owe your brother an apology. He was the one who had his privacy and trust and consent violated by someone who is clearly highly disrespectful, toxic and manipulative.

He didn't know she was sending snaps of him in sexual situations. He may not have been aware she was photographing or videoing him at all.

So you go back to your brother and apologise and ask him how you can support him before you react further to Nicole because there's a strong possibility she's going to 'revenge porn' your brother further and this situation may escalate.

Nicole's waiting for you and him to blaze in so she can burn it high so starve her of oxygen while you group together for strength and consider your legal options and the best way to proceed that robs Nicole of her power. 

She's depending on you getting mad with your brother and starting a flame war. Don't give her the reaction. You outsmart shitty manipulative people by not trying to match their shittiness but by being the best calmness person possible because it always shows them up more than matching their toxic energy.

Also depending where you live these images may be illegal so this is more serious than just a falling out. The hare and the tortoise comes to mind here as to how you proceed (albeit if the hare went round posting sex snaps which is quite a thought...)"
"If you work till 8 and he's at the pub,  who is with the children? And he's drinking every friday night with the boys,  again,  what about the kids??  Does he ever make dedicated time with his kids?  

Im very social and totally get the need for outings and yes it should be equal and he sounds totally awful to you!  But also awful to your kids :(    

Maybe learn how to drive so you can be a little more independent, sounds like you may need it soon."
"I realize that seeing something like that was completely devastating, and most people in your position would be completely devastated - that's why most people don't go through their partner's phones. 

If you chose to leave your girlfriend over this, it would be justified - but you're overlooking the fact that she chose to work out her confusing feelings with a friend and avoid temptation. Being in a good relationship doesn't make you instantly become asexual to everyone except your partner - it means that you don't act on your attraction to other people and respect the boundaries you've set with your partner. 

My ex once asked me why he couldn't have the password to my computer - I told him it was because I have a journal on my computer, and I use my journal to work out negative feelings. Processing them quietly by myself helps me to distinguish which problems can just be solved by adjusting my attitude, and which problems need to be worked out with someone else. I was COMPLETELY up-front with him about how important, and how private, it was to me. Well, I ran out to get us coffee one morning, and before my computer went to sleep, he read in my journal about how his anger problem scared me - and he got really mad about it. Like, REALLY mad. After that, journaling just didn't work for me any more - I couldn't trust that what I was writing was private, so I couldn't be as honest with myself as I was before, and it stopped being a useful coping tool. He took something really valuable from me.

TLDR: You can't unsee what you saw, but if you want to be in healthy relationships in the future, you have to learn to respect your partner's privacy and boundaries."
"My dad committed suicide last fall and I actually had this same thought. I was hiking and talking to him out loud right after it happened and told him I was taking him with me wherever I go from now on. It was an oddly comforting thought - to know he was part of me and I was going to make good choices in life. I‚Äôve since decided to try to become healthier by being more active and eating better, and I always keep in mind that it‚Äôs ultimately for my mental health and those of my children. I have to keep the demons at bay. I refuse to follow in his footsteps and have used his death instead as an inspiration walk further away form darkness and towards the light. I want his legacy to be a beautiful one, despite the sadness."
"Cancel! They just don't get on the flight! Or they're adults and find a hotel or other accommodation. Not your problem.

Your marriage is in crisis and you're not advocating for yourself. Stand up for what you need, which is not to have the extra burden of hosting people who have a very fresh, painful betrayal of you.

""We're really going through some things in our marriage, and we're simply unable to host or see you at this time."" That's all you have to say."
"Tbh, cut the contact. This relationship isn't giving you anything! Yes he can be nice and sweet, but so can other people, without laying hands on you, being horrible to you etc. THAT is not normal! You are going through a hard time, trying your best every day, but all he does is lie and put you down.

You deserve better.

Cut the contact, take care of your son and the new child if you'd like to!

My father was also abusive (verbally) to my mom from the day I was born until I was two, it's like he used me to manipulate her. She broke up with him, he flew back to his country and would occasionally try to force his way in again, but she didn't let him. Cut the contact. I grew up without him in a loving environment, my mom's side of the family is great, I do not miss him a single day. And I'm happy she toom the steps she needed to take in order to keep me safe and let me grow up happily."
"Yes. ANY PUNISHMENT IS TOO EXTREME A PUNISHMENT. You're both adults. You get to have a relationship that you both agree on and that makes you both happy. He's not your parent or your boss. 

In a healthy relationship, you can say things that your partner disagrees with, or even things that upset your partner, and they'll talk it out with you (or even have an argument!) instead of punishing you until you take it back."
The only way to do it is to do it. Go for it! I was in a band in the 80s and it was a blast.
I‚Äôm far more upset at the husband here. At the end of the day Jane doesn‚Äôt really owe Op a friendship. But her husband is being a real POS.
"Or has she been hurt by someone else recently and is now traumatized? That‚Äôs where my thoughts went immediately was, ‚ÄúOh no. She‚Äôs been sexually assaulted or something awful.‚Äù"
"Your friend molested you and took your fearful silence as consent. He ignored your body language and your attempts to redirect in order to pursue what he wanted. Your reaction of freezing up is incredibly normal and a very natural response to extreme stress. It's not a natural thing to yell ""no,"" like we're told we're supposed to do, when we've been conditioned for our entire lives to make other people comfortable."
"""  Out of the blue, I got a message request on FB from my dad, saying he wants to reconnect. That he's out all his anger and resentment on the side and hopes my sister and I can do the same. ""

So, he's hoping you'll just... pretend his actions had no negative consequences for you? How very selfish of him. He doesn't get to switch you on and off when it suits him. He did great damage to you and your sister, especially in the situation with your grandmother. If you want to ignore him and live your best life without him, you have this internet stranger's blessing."
I‚Äôm a straight guy and if I saw someone harping on anyone else‚Äôs sexuality I‚Äôd step in and say something. It‚Äôs no one else‚Äôs business. But then again I come from a slightly homophobic culture (that I totally disagree with) and that‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt sit well with me.
"&gt;He's in love with the dog. He spent a lot of money on it and he thinks it's the most gorgeous thing ever

So he didn't buy it for YOU. He bought it for himself and gave it to you under the pretense of being an apology.

A dog is not a gift, especially an unwanted dog (and yes, I understand that you could love it, but you DIDNT want another pitbull). It's frankly cruel to give an animal that lives ~15 years to someone as a gift. A dog should be a wanted thing, and something you feel comfortable and ready to provide a good life for, not a gift you were unprepared for.

Not to mention-- A gift that someone has said they don't want is not a gift.

A gift that will cost someone oodles over a decade+ is not a gift!

He did not do this for you.

I think you need to be blunt and tell him you don't want the dog. ""I understand you spent a lot of money on it. You're welcome to keep it for yourself or try to sell it. You can't spring a pet on someone. I don't want another big dog. My PARENTS, whose house I live in, aren't okay with a surprise pet all of a sudden. Not to mention that a gift, especially one I have said I don't want, is not an apology for doing something wrong. This is a living creature and shouldn't be used as a bartering tool. Fights don't get resolved by buying gifts. We can have a conversation about our feelings and sort them out that way. But for now, I am not taking care of this dog I didn't ask for.""


I hope, with some distance and perspective, you can see what a truly BONKERS thing this is to do under the pretense of ""an apology"" because giving someone a puppy and then making them feel bad about how much you love it and how expensive it was is... unstable at best."
He sounds insane. Please break off this toxic relationship before your self esteem issues get any worse. He is a manipulative bully and that‚Äôs what you need to tell him. Repeatedly.
"&gt; That he's out all his anger and resentment on the side and hopes my sister and I can do the same.

This is so far from an apology that the audacity of sending it at all is jaw-dropping. 

Your dad hasn‚Äôt changed a bit. Tell him to get bent. He chose which kids he wanted in his life the day he abandoned you and your *five year old* sister. You owe him nothing and he‚Äôs not interested in earning anything back."
"I‚Äôm going to go the other direction. People who say ‚Äúoh just stop looking, it‚Äôll happen!‚Äù when you‚Äôre 35 are delusional. Same with the ‚Äújust be happy!‚Äù Comments.

No one would say those lines about anything else in life. No one has ever said ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry about school, honor roll will just happen!‚Äù Or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about that promotion, if you stop caring you‚Äôll finally get that position!‚Äù

Nope. For everything else in life, you‚Äôre expected to work hard and SMART for it. But people get this weird naive outlook when it comes to relationships for some reason. 

You need to work hard for it. I don‚Äôt mean endless tinder swiping. Go online and do some real research. Figure out what dating tool your target demographic - 30-40s year old men who aren‚Äôt creeps - are using. Maybe even consider hiring a professional to help you as a 21st century match maker (yes these exist). 

Treat it like anything else in life, and instead of focusing on other hobbies to bury the aloneness, focus your energies on getting into a relationship. Figure out how to target the right type of person, figure out how to socially bond better, whatever.

There is NO SHAME in trying to be in a relationship and no shame in working hard to specifically hit that goal!! People act as if it‚Äôs shallow to want a life partner, but I bet those same folks giving you ‚Äúadvice‚Äù are also in relationships. 

I‚Äôm married and I want to validate your feelings 100%. I would not be happy single. No, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many friends you have. I‚Äôm not cuddling my friends every night in bed, I‚Äôm not giving my friends kisses and giggling, my friends aren‚Äôt making fun of my toothbrushing habits, my friends aren‚Äôt raising a kid with me. The whole counterargument is just ridiculous. So if you want a relationship, you should go put your effort into getting it. Enough of spending time pretending you don‚Äôt want it, or spending time on other ‚Äúcoping‚Äù mechanisms. Pretend it‚Äôs a promotion you want and go make a checklist of tasks to get there!!"
LOL wut?  She honestly cannot expect that you'll stay in a different hotel for the wedding.  And your husband is nuts if he thinks any of this is ok.
Make sure you take out the money you have in your account and move it to a NEW bank-one your parents don't know and are not connected to. If that account was opened before you were 18 they are still probably on the account and can take the money with no consequences. It happens ALL the time. Don't leave it at the same bank often they can talk their way into getting the money.
"No, you would not be able to afford it.  Having the cash to pay for an expensive item doesn't mean that you can *afford* to spend your money that way.

You are living at home, paying off your student loans.   There is no way you can afford to enable your girlfriend's fantasy of an overpriced ring.   Let's say you do indulge and do it; what kind of wedding is she planning to go along with this expensive ring?  Are you going to delay paying off your debt to finance that too?

The issue of giving her an expensive ring is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to your ignorance of the practicalities when it comes to marriage and finances.   Neither of you have to deal with the day to day managing a household and you are talking about blowing a huge chunk of money on a ring."
"Unless those kids are already well into their teens, you‚Äôre not going to be able to live with/marry their father while completely avoiding any responsibility or caretaking duties. That‚Äôs just not how it works. And it‚Äôs kind of amazing that that hasn‚Äôt occurred to you. 

If you‚Äôre not willing to ever take on a parent-like role in his childrens‚Äô lives, this is probably not the guy for you, and it‚Äôs better to accept that sooner rather than later. You‚Äôre both deluding yourselves if you think otherwise."
"Sunk cost fallacy. You will never change him. Every month it will get worse. You are not financially compatible and he is very disrespectful of your mom by making it seem like it‚Äôs a drag to pay her back instead of a privilege to have gotten her help. 

And why should he not pay her back if you‚Äôre no longer in a relationship? The two aren‚Äôt related and if he thinks it is, this is another indication you‚Äôre not compatible. 

He will keep needing and taking. You will never be even. Don‚Äôt waste your time trying to manipulate him into honesty. It won‚Äôt happen."
"Sorry, but I'd like to know more about this $250 plane ticket to Paris, since where I'm from it would cost at least a thousand. (serious question)"
"I don't even know what else to say but this. This whole story was a goddamn rollarcoaster of ""why are you with him this guy is bananas"""
"Just call the police ahead of time (on a non-emergency line).  Let them know that they have abused you in the past and have threatened you with violence if you go back.  Don't give them the opportunity to make things worse by showing up alone the first time.

At a bare minimum, have a friend (not the boyfriend) come along and video tape the whole thing to make sure they behave.

Also, you may well have some protections under Landlord/Tenant laws that mean they can't just throw you out like that."
"He's got a history of being skeevy, so I don't blame you for being uncomfortable. The unfortunate reality, as someone who was abused by a guy like this, is that unless you have sufficient proof he's harming minors, nothing can really be done. The girl he's seeing is 18, so there's nothing illegal about the relationship. 

Creepy? Yes. Abusive? Possibly. I'm sure there are dynamics like this out there that aren't about abusing / grooming the younger party, but they're rare. If a guy is exclusively into the youngest possible age he can legally get with, there's clearly a problem, but in the eyes of the law there's nothing you can do to keep him away from younger women as long as they are 'legal'. 

You can try to contact her parents and express your concerns, but this is sadly something she'll have to figure out on her own. Probably after she turns 22 and ages out of the range your brother finds acceptable. I'd cut your brother out of your life for your own safety and sanity."
"Dude is dating someone 10 years younger than him, he‚Äôs probably not very mature."
"The parents are willing to go and live (or threaten to live) in an unsafe and politically unstable country, just to force them into breaking up. That level of emotional manipulation is beyond insane. They're threatening to put themselves in danger unless their son complies with their wishes. These people hate the fact that OP has a child *so much* that they are either willing to lie  to force their son to pick them, or they are literally planning on returning to their country, putting themselves at risk, and cutting contact with their child.  

It speaks to the horrific lengths they'll go to to control their son, and it speaks to how extremely unlikely it is that they would ever change their mind about OP. Honestly, OP dodged a bullet, as much as my heart breaks for her and her boyfriend. Imagine being tied to these in-laws for life?What else are they capable of when they don't get their way?"
"Problem here though is it sounds like you said you don‚Äôt want a relationship due to the timing. Therefore, in his mind, he thinks ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll play friend until she‚Äôs ready and then I‚Äôll be ready to swoop in‚Äù. You have to be more straightforward and tell him you aren‚Äôt interested in HIM. People can be clueless sometimes when it comes to taking hints so I find it‚Äôs best to be straightforward lol."
"Wow this wonderful advice that I did not think of at all. I will definitely lock down my credit. Also, completely forgot that I never even took my passport from her. I will go back and get that and if she insists on being violent and not allow me in, I will call the police."
"He needs to get his head out of his butt and start acting like your husband all the time, not just at home when no one else is around. Have a serious talk with him about how his behavior makes you feel neglected and see if there‚Äôs a reason why he believes other women deserve his undivided attention but you don‚Äôt."
"If they keep doing this BS tell them you don't accept that, you realize that she is having a rough time. But it's not you and other room mates job to pay for her to be a nuisance in YOUR apartment. He can either have her start paying a share of house hold bills, or he can cover that extra for her and not tell her, or he can move out. I'd draw a line in the sand and stick to it. In addition, she doesn't get any claim to the bathroom in peak hours. She doesn't pay the bills and can go pack sand. If I had to shower and get set at the gym instead of my own house, so someone who doesn't contribute to bills can hog my bathroom there would be hell to pay. None of this shit you've described them doing is ok. Whether her home life is hard or not. It's not a valid reason to then turn around and make you and other roommates lives hell. They need to figure it the fuck out."
"Weddings are intense and usually involve a LOT of compromise for financial and scheduling reasons. I'm very confident that she had to make the decision for a multitude of reasons and none of those reasons include you being a bad friend.

Ask if there's anything you can help with. Get involved and show genuine, altruistic compassion and support for your friend."
"Definitely call Brown. If you're semi-local, try and see if you can speak to them in person. Sadly, your situation isn't wholly uncommon. They'll be able to help you out.  I'm so sorry that your parents have treated you this way."
"Girl... Fuck. This. Guy. I was with my (now ex)husband for 10 years. We met in high school, dated off and on, had a child, and then he got a side chick. Umm, nope! I know it sucks when this sort of thing comes out of the blue, but you will be much better off without this ass hat."
"They are right. He is much older and in a completely different place in his life, his kids are absolutely priority. Based on many comments you‚Äôve made here, you‚Äôve no interest in taking on any kind of responsibility regarding the kids, which is completely fine but in that case you should not be dating a father. I do think the family should be discussing this with him though, and not berating you. It isn‚Äôt your fault that you‚Äôre a normal 24 year old who isn‚Äôt interested in children right now. But unfortunately it‚Äôs not a compatible situation; he needs to focus on his children."
"Even if he isn‚Äôt cheating, you‚Äôre miserable. That‚Äôs more than enough reason to leave. You‚Äôre wasting time that could be spent with someone who makes you happy."
I think it is awful that he would say that to you. I am so sorry.
"You wouldn‚Äôt be divorcing him because of a cat, you‚Äôd be divorcing him cause he‚Äôs a shitty person."
"&gt; The whole 'I do think it's unfair for her to do this to me without giving a chance' kind of makes my alarm bells go off, no offense

I also think it completely ignores the fact that he had multiple chances to let this go over their ""reassurance sessions"" but expected to keep harping on it to his satisfaction. He's not being very sensitive to her perspective and how exhausting it can be to deal with a clingy, passive-aggressive partner that you have to train out of being angry at you for having a life or handhold to realize when they are not being supportive. I think a large dose of self-awareness would be helpful here."
Him going around checking if his wife cleaned properly is not something that should be rationalised. That is wrong and fucked up no matter how you look at it. She should be doing less and he should get his head checked.
The bigger question is why are you paying for all this stuff for him??? Holy moly! And after 6 months no less!
"That guy is a an ass. Total BS! hes just negging you. I'm female, 30s I can pick up guys that are younger than him. He's not your mate that's for sure."
"There is literally no way to tell someone they need to lose weight that's not going to hurt them. By all accounts, he doesn't appear to have said anything rude or hurtful.

It's ok to have hurt feelings, but you can't blame the messenger because the message sucks. He wasn't wrong."
Jesus thanks for saying this.
"Do you have Facebook? 

My aunts and uncles have disagreements and rifts that go back decades. Facebook has been a nice way for me to have a relationship with them on my terms. I never discuss the content of arguments and never even mention anything that might have been said or might have happened in the past. If it gets mentioned, I avoid the topic and don't acknowledge it. But at least I can like and comment on their pictures and show that there is no animosity. 

If she has a Facebook, I would just send her a message! IF not, send her a text! 

""Hey aunt, I know that you and cousin are going through a really tough time right now with his recovery. I can't imagine how hard overcoming this challenge must be. You're a great mom! I love you and look forward to seeing you and cousin at Christmas &lt;3"" 

Literally don't mention anything about the fight. You're an adult, reach out on your own terms. Maybe you can't be super close, but you can at least send her a nice message to show that you care and don't agree with your mom. 

DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN THEIR FIGHT"
"&gt; And I really do wish I could cut down the amount I clean but it‚Äôs literally what my husband tells me to do everyday and he goes round and checks when he gets home.

He is not your boss, or your father, or your owner. He does not actually get to tell you what to do."
"So it's not like ... ""If you want different weddings or you disagree on wedding expenses, then you just aren't right for each other!"" But the way that things are going with wedding planning, it really sounds like there are bigger issues at play.

You say that he wants to be married and is excited about it, and that it's just the wedding that's the issue. But it's a huge issue that he sees major compromises as you ""getting your way,"" that he's using the wedding's existence as fodder against you, and that he's disengaged entirely from planning his own wedding. This isn't a situation where it's okay to do that.

I know that this sounds hard, but I think you need to but the brakes on, ASAP. You've got money in savings to pay your mother back for what she's spent--apologize to her and pay her back, cancel the reservation at the restaurant, send a message to guests that ""We are dealing with a private family emergency and have to postpone the wedding, we will let you know when we've rescheduled it,"" and get you and your fiance to couple's therapy as soon as possible."
"FWIW my mom didn't work really outside the house (she's an artist) but her boundary was always 'if you want a housekeeper, hire one. I'm a wife, not a servant.' 

Something to consider."
"Mutual support is one of the foundations of any adult relationship, and by age 26, it's completely reasonable for her to feel that she shouldn't have to tell you basic things like ""comfort me when I'm scared"" and ""don't react passive-aggressively to my job."" Honestly, a lot of what you've said makes it seem like she's right about the life stages thing.

It sounds like you're blaming her for not talking you through every step of becoming a better boyfriend, but put yourself in your GF's shoes. She's taken on a very demanding career track, one that leaves her less time than she'd like for socializing and all her non-work responsibilities. And despite that, you're expecting her to come home and constantly give you advice, wrangle with your jealousy, and teach you how to be a good partner. She's got to be *exhausted*.

I don't think this is going to work out the way you want it to, but if you have any chance at all, that starts with not bugging her as she's thinking things over. She said she needed some time, so you have to show you can respect her boundaries. And if she decides she can't be with you anymore, you have to accept that instead of trying to change her mind."
"&gt;When I met my boyfriend, we experimented with different contraception but it was suggested by multiple doctors and gynos that I go on the IUD. I was warned the IUD would make my period worse but it was the best solution.

Condoms are extremely effective at preventing pregnancy when used properly. The best solution is not for you to put something in your body that makes you feel worse. The best solution is to stop letting this idiot splooge inside of you when he can't even be assed to a) use condoms and b) treat you with respect regarding menstruation and all that comes with it including PMS

&gt;We've gotten in arguments because I don't satisfy him sexually enough on the week when I'm bleeding.

Ha! STOP sexually satisfying him AT. ALL. during your period. Are you even serious, why the f!ck would you give him sexy times of any kind when he's so mean to you about your period. I hope to god you're not slobbing on his knob while gushing blood and in pain. The audacity of his attitude...if he really understood how much pain you were in he wouldn't let your teeth anywhere near his dangle out of fear you'd chomp by mistake when a cramp hit you. For that reason alone, since he doesn't seem to feel empathy towards you.

&gt;Apart from this time he's wonderful and this doesn't happen every time but it happens more than not.

I'm 47. 23 years older than you. That means I have had a period for nearly a quarter century longer than you. And I'm still very much menstrual. Menopause does not typically happen until *at least* age 50. Miss, do you really want to put up with this whiny, inconsiderate dude for decades more?? Can you honestly put up with this for 1 year more. Heck one month more. Do you still want to be going though this next month??

&gt;It's like he doesn't know this happens every three weeks.

You need to find a man who understands the human reproductive cycle

&gt;How do I deal with this?

Cut him loose"
"Yeah, it's kind of fucked up that he's downvoting women posting nudes just because they're not to his specific taste.

I don't think it's necessarily a sign that he's not attracted to you. People's taste in porn doesn't always reflect what it's like when they interact with someone in real life. But rather than focusing on whether you're adequate enough, I might stop and think about whether his mean-spirited behavior is really something you're okay with. Does it come out in other ways? How does he respond when you are vulnerable with him? Or is it literally just on reddit?"
"seeing as she made this choice and then immediately texted you about ‚Äòhow hard it‚Äôll be for her‚Äô, you can definitely be upset. she sounds a little crazy IMO and a tad bit stalker-y. I would let your coach know that you have had a negative past with her and just warn him of the situation ahead of time. I‚Äôm not sure what he could do, but letting him know that this is a past abuser of yours will help later if she tries to pull any shit."
"I feel like this is something that should be taken up with HR, and possibly the police department. He had no real reason to run your name, yet he did. She had no reason to suspect anything and had her husband do some work for her. Talk to HR and see what options you have."
"Yeah I think you're doing the right thing by ending the friendship. It's honestly really gross that she's someone who clearly is successful and educated in her own right being called a bimbo because she's into ""girly"" things I'm guessing.

And you said this guy has a history of being jealous and that you're life has gotten better the less he's in, so I'm guessing his behavior isn't exactly new. Good riddance."
"I think you're right. She doesn't owe me an explaination when she says she wants kids, and I could probably do a better job of respecting that."
"&gt;I genuinely believe he was worried for me, but I don't know what changed.

Honestly, without evidence of something else specific, it sounds like he's plain sexist. It's ""dangerous"" for a woman to go but it's peachy for him."
How did you manage to type this entire thing out without coming to the conclusion you should ditch him and block his contact info forever.
"&gt;By then we had both calmed down and entered the ""regret"" phase I know he always goes through.

Good!  You've recognized that there is a pattern to this behavior!  Some might even call it a cycle...

What your very written is so typical of abusive relationships.  The cycle of violent outbursts, feeling sorry, ""love bombing"" to make up for it, and then a period of slowly increasing tension until the next outburst.  It's not a perfect circle, though, because there is actually some variation to it.

&gt;It caught me off guard how angry he sounded 

And this what I mean by that.  It's not so much a circle as a spiral.  The violent outbursts escalate.  You've noticed the escalation because it surprised you how much worse it was this time compared to others.  Think back to other times he surprised you with his outbursts.  Was there a time you couldn't imagine him screaming?  Or calling you names?  Or getting in your face?  Or forcing open locked doors?  Or threatening you?

This doesn't get better on it's own.  You aren't going to wake up one day and say ""this is as bad as it's ever going to get, he'll never get madder than he did last night"".  There's always another level to take it to.  How much longer until he's putting his hands on you?  From the sounds of it, not much longer.

The fact that you blame yourself for his outbursts is also very typical of a woman trapped in an abusive dynamic with their partner.  Have you ever read stories about women who are beaten, threatened with weapons, hospitalized by their husbands, but don't leave them, go back to them, and never press charges?  Have you wondered how anyone could let themselves get like that.  Well, here's the secret - those women have convinced themselves that they're responsible for the things that happen to them.  They get a black eye because the trash isn't taken out and instead of reaching the reasonable conclusion that ""violence over not taking the trash out is insane, my husband is insane"", they think ""oh, I should have known better.  He's right, I didn't do my job, I deserve to be punished, because I caused this."". Sound familiar?

Loveisrespect.org is a website I highly recommend you browse.  Your experience is not unique, and there is help for you out there if you choose to look for it."
Sounds like he‚Äôs insecure and by putting you down he thinks that‚Äôs building him up. Sounds like ex boyfriend material to me.
"but who actually wants to jump into something after a 5 year relationship ended? he probably wants to be alone and get some peace and quiet. this post reads like sharks circling... just because the timing is right for OP, doesn't mean it's right for someone that just got out of half a decade of relationship."
Family doesn‚Äôt owe each other a solution to every problem. Especially if that person is not helping themselves. OP‚Äôs sibling is a grown adult. Nobody has an obligation to support her. And I would argue to do so at this point would be to enable her. Not help her.
"Obviously I don‚Äôt know his side of things but it seems like you did everything you could on your part. It‚Äôs really rude for one and inconsiderate for him to think it‚Äôs okay to bring her over like that. I think the ‚Äúno‚Äù type responses are really immature too. Either way give him his time, hopefully once she leaves he will have time to think and apologize to you for that. I just had my family over and it‚Äôs stressful as all the attention needs to go to family and things can get irritating."
A lot of times people don't want to be the one who seems confrontational. He probably blamed you to avoid conflict as they work together.  I wouldn't be worried about it.
"Yes, yes, yes. You will have a brunch table cracking up about how you left this dumb dude. I know because I did it. Honestly, I had no idea how good a relationship could be"
He is doing what he should be doing as an extended house guest. I assume he's living there and not paying rent? And not working? Yes he should be cleaning and making the place nice. That is his contribution to the house.
"That is the point. That he cannot be left alone but it isn't fair to you and your mother to deal with his crap. 

Sounds like it is time for a nursing home. The advice above is fantastic. Call the social worker and they can help you."
"&gt;he thought we were over

This isn't an excuse to cheat, but I would believe him that your relationship is over. Start getting your ducks in order. Also, this would be the time to start working on yourself, hopefully with a therapist so that the next relationship will be more healthy"
"I gotta say this is a pretty real problem for my relationship, and it gets exhausting always being the one who puts in active effort. My bf of 2 years doesn‚Äôt put in much effort into thinking of things to do or initiating conversation or sex, but thinks something is wrong (with me or us) when I choose not to do those things. The truth is, I just sometimes don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm taking care of a child. We‚Äôve had several conversations about this but things end up going back to normal after a while... I love this man and he‚Äôs wonderful and sweet and kind and he can *sometimes* put in very thoughtful effort. 
But most of the time, he plays a very passive role in our relationship and it drains me of fervor and passion, and it does make me feel a little unloved at times. 

Please be mindful of the way she appreciates receiving affection and love, OP. It doesn‚Äôt take much, but very small acts can mean a lot to someone."
"Tell your boyfriend to stop PMS'ing. ;)

Seriously though, have you been evaluated for endo? Because it sounds like you might have it and you might need to change your birth control situation. It's ignored in a lot of younger women, and it was in me.

The ideal birth control situation for me was skipping periods altogether. You can do this with the injection or with pills. For some people the hormonal IUD helps your periods go away, which might be why your gynos recommended it, but that does not sound like it's working for you.

I think it's important for your boyfriend to grow up and realize that you have a legitimate health condition that has side effects and challenges to live with, and if he's going to diminish you for that, he can gtfo.

But for your quality of life you should continue pursuing better care as well. And an official diagnosis. Check out /r/endo"
"Just so you know, swearing is not a good enough reason to ever physically harm another human. Even if you did swear, she does not have the right to ever put her hands on you. 
I hope you get to live with your father soon."
"You're under-reacting. The reasonable, respectful action here is to dump him. 

He's 38. He under-functioned here and acted like a dick.

There is probably nothing going on here, but his utterly inability to communicate with you respectfully and his horribly poor judgement marks him a pretty shitty partner. 

Don't take this one on yourself. Just hard next and move on."
"I'm on our bank accounts and credit cards. Years ago I managed our finances and it was very stressful for me, and I frankly, sucked at it. Husband took it over and I thought did better at it. 

I could have bought shoes and a bra I guess - but every week my husband would say ""Oh, money's REALLY tight, we don't want to be overdrawn,"" or ""We REALLY have to pay down that credit card debt."" I don't want to be overdrawn, and I don't want to add to the debt, so I just sucked it up. I probably should have just bought the damn bra and shoes. 

I did, today actually."
"In the short term, every time you go grocery shopping, get $20 cash back. Save those $20s. Get your bra/shoes. Use them to run and never look back."
"For a relationship to be healthy and long-lasting, it has to have two things: compatibility, and balance.  For it to be that fairy-tale romance everyone wants, it needs to have an additional thing: passion.

The thing that the two of you are lacking is compatibility.

Compatibility means that both of the people in the relationship must be able to have what they *need* in order to feel fulfilled, without preventing the other person from having what s/he needs.

In your case, you need to have a lifestyle that is more adventurous and exploratory, and he needs to have one that is more sedate and centered around settling down. There is likely no compromise here, because for there to be, *one* of you would have to give up the lifestyle you need in order to be happy.

On top of that, the whole ""terms and conditions"" thing is immensely troubling, because it implies that you and he are not equal partners; it suggests that you answer to him, and that he is your keeper.  That's an implicit power imbalance between you, and *that* means that, in addition to being incompatible, the two of you are also not in a *balanced* relationship.

So.  You do not have balance, and you do not have compatibility.  The only thing you *ever* had was passion.  A relationship with passion but nothing else ends up...well, *here*.

Let it go.  There is no ""patching this up"".  To change the outcome, you would have to make fundamental changes to your own nature, or his, or both."
"Has your sister been assessed by a doctor for any behavioural issues?

Since she wont listen to you and your parents wont put in boundaries and get her help then your only options are live there and take it or move out unfortunately.

I would encourage your parents about getting her assessed and if they still refuse unfortunaely your sister will learn all this stuff a very hard embarrasing way in adulthood, but that just may be the path she needs, you've already warned her."
It definitely started getting like that.
I‚Äôd have fucking cut your father and his preferred family years ago if I were you. What a total douchebag.
"Haha oh yeah, I had a doctor tell me that losing weight would likely help with a health problem I was having. I lost the weight, the health issue immediately disappeared, and the next time I went in, my normally kind of hardass doctor looked at my chart and it was like I had just thrown her a beautiful and perfect surprise party. She tells people to lose weight to help with health issues all the time, but turns out almost nobody does and it totally made her day to see someone actually take her professional opinion to heart."
"Then it could just be he is riffing off what you have said about yourself, and thinking that--if you say it--then it is okay for him to say it. After all, not being beautiful doesn't equate to you not being attractive/handsome/cute/other words to do with aesthetic appearance.

I would ask him what he is defining as beautiful. It could just be that he is trying to say (badly) that of course there are women out there who are profoundly physically awesome (in which case he would also agree that he wouldn't consider himself at the attractiveness level of 'beautiful'), but that this means nothing in the face of love, and that you still are [other words associated with attractiveness].

Or he is just being an asshole, but it sounds like that would be outside his usual behaviour."
"So basically everything he said you agree with, but you're still mad? I think you need to realize that you are upset about the situation. Not with your SO."
"Damn. It's one thing to shit on your dreams but quite another to then go and grind them into the ground beneath his feet.

Was this really about concern for your safety? He didn't want you to have fun there without him. He didn't have any problem with having fun there without you. He convinced you not to go, he could have spent the summer with you, scholarship or no scholarship. Doing this shows exactly how much relationship awareness he has. Zero. Well, that's the kinder route to take, suggesting that he's a moron. Less kind but more realistic is suggesting that he knew how it would be seen and didn't care. Mindless or selfish? Take your pick.

You don't want this to damage things between you, but let's be honest here. It has. Is that enough to make or break the relationship? Grounds enough to seriously reconsider things at the very least."
"You might think these are innocent white lies, but add them all together and it paints a pattern of behavior that is pathological.  Even if she has social anxiety she shouldn't feel a need to continuously lie to her significant other."
"This relationship is so unhealthy and the video is just the cherry on top. He's filming women without their knowledge and consent for his own gratification, he's lying to you and deleting messages from other women, and he's trying to manipulate you into thinking this is your fault. This will not change. This is who he is. Leave him. Staying would be foolish."
"Yeah, when I read ""peacekeeper"", I couldn't help but read ""enabler and excuser"" instead"
"Instead of ""emotional labor"" I recommend OP look up ""mental load"" 

Emotional labor is more about problem solving in the relationship and intimacy - who notices issues and is proactive to addressing them with their partner? Who is adjusting their behavior to make the relationship better, make the family better? 

Mental load refers to the logistics of keeping things running smoothly. If one partner is the one who physically goes to the grocery store, that's regular labor. But if they only go after their other partner has made a list, and then they text them constantly checking what to do when an item is out of stock, then they aren't carrying the mental load, the other partner is. Mental load is about knowing what needs to be done for everyone in the household, communicating that with the household especially other adults, and then dividing tasks in the most efficient way. 

It sounds like OP and his wife are probably mostly equal on these fronts, but OP should double-check with himself to make sure he really is carrying half the emotional labor and half the mental load."
"Maybe he's expressing frustration that his wife is questioning his sexuality? Maybe he knows that you are looking at his texts? I mean, this all sounds a little controlling... If I was your husband, I would not be happy with your behavior and might vent to a co-worker."
"Definitely just reach out to your Aunt and go play some games with your cousin. 

Don‚Äôt tell your Mom about it. Keep her on an information diet‚Äîdon‚Äôt become a flying monkey or someone your Aunt and her family can‚Äôt trust. Your Mom has lost her right to know what‚Äôs going on in her sister‚Äôs life.

Don‚Äôt try to make excuses for your Mom either. There‚Äôs a very strong possibility that at some point you‚Äôll be a target of your Mom‚Äôs abhorrent behavior and it seems like your Aunt might be a good person to have around to support you if and when that happens."
Take the dog and leave. This isn‚Äôt a guy you want to stick around with. He isn‚Äôt showing any consideration for you in any of his decisions. That‚Äôs not a guy you want to be serious with.
"My dad is dating someone my age and every time he mentions something we have in common I respond, ""well of course we do, since she's my age!"" Like the only reason why her dad even probably recognizes some of things his GF likes or memories she has is because of his daughter. It's creepy AF.

&amp;#x200B;

Good for you for taking the high road and being so welcoming to her. When their relationship fails I hope you guys can stay friends."
"Yeah... OP seems (more than?) a little homophobic. I don't get her obsession with ""finding out if he's gay or bi"" rather than ""finding out if he's cheating on me."" What does it matter what someone's orientation is if they respect and love you and stick to the rules of your relationship?"
She really wants to end a 7 year relationship over this? That‚Äôs... definitely overreacting. Was this the only negative experience she‚Äôs had with your family?
"She's not a communist, she's a freeloader. If you don't want to tie yourself to somebody not interested in working, you do not have to."
"&gt; he‚Äôll say I can‚Äôt go unless I do the house before

Oh my god, no. Your husband is controlling and abusive. He isn't just not realizing how much work being a SAHM is. **He is forbidding you from leaving the house when you want to.** If you're not ready to see a lawyer, please, please, please start seeing a therapist-- there are many online options available now that can accommodate busy schedules."
"That‚Äôs always the ‚Äútell‚Äù of abusers.  He ‚Äúcan‚Äôt control himself‚Äù unless he‚Äôs at work, or with his friends, or around anyone other than their victim.  But when it‚Äôs just them and their abuse target, all of a sudden their rages are just totally out of control (leading the victim to blame themselves, because they‚Äôre convinced they do something especially wrong to provoke the behavior)."
"&gt; Yeah, she‚Äôs mentioned ‚Äúemotional work‚Äù or emotional labor before but **I‚Äôm not sure what that involves entirely**

This is the crux of the problem. Women are almost always expected to understand and perform emotional labor while men aren't, and often men end up asking the woman to give them instructions on how to shoulder the emotional labor, further adding to her responsibility rather than actually contributing to the relationship. Saying ""I don't know what to say most of the time"" isn't good enough. You absolutely can learn to be a compassionate listener and an active participant in helping her sort through tough times, it just takes the work that women are expected to inherently possess. Time to google emotional labor and start practicing it."
"This is A LOT for being five months into the relationship. She needs to focus on herself.  What's there to understand? She's unhappy, unhealthy, depressed and seems to be trying to work on that."
This person 100 percent groomed you when you were a child so that he could abuse you. He is a predator. Please tell the school and the police if you feel comfortable doing so.
"&gt;. I‚Äôm not mad at him for quitting the job 


*Youuuuu shooouuuulllld beeeeeeeee mmmmaaaaaaad.* Imagine there was an echo while you read that. 

Your boyfriend had this planned from the start and he won‚Äôt ever voluntarily contribute to the household. The time to break the lease was after he told you he didn‚Äôt have the deposit. Look up your legal options and save any communications where he states he owes the money. 

Can you tell his parents? Any chance they can squeeze the money out of him?"
"Whether or not he agrees is up to him, and at this point not your problem. He‚Äôs the one causing you and your mom to leave. HE filed for divorce. He‚Äôs being manipulative. His plan for care is up to him, and Not Your Problem now."
"Here's the thing: you live with your mother, who has a mental illness, and who has not modeled what a healthy relationship looks like for you. Your mother financially abused you, and that's all you've known in terms of an example.


Because of that context, right now, you do not have the experience or context to recognize that you are in another unhealthy relationship. You don't realize it is unhealthy because it's just like everything you've always known; it seems normal to you.


Let me assure you: it isn't normal. And it isn't healthy. 


Your girlfriend is exhibiting extremely controlling behaviors (trying to control what you buy and how you handle your money), your girlfriend is exhibiting extremely manipulative behaviors (trying to make you feel bad until you give her what she wants), and your girlfriend is exhibiting extremely entitled behaviors (demanding you acquiesce to her decisions about what house, and when).


You're moving from your mother to a woman just like your mother.


Take some time to be single and find ways to learn about healthy relationships and behavior."
"No. 

Just. No. She's already done counseling. Alone because he refused. 

She sounds completely checked out (as she should be). Counseling now is just a waste of time and money. The woman has holes in her shoes because her husband doesn't give a shit and is off buying stuff they can't afford instead of making sure his wife has her basic physical needs met! 

Best cast scenario she wastes some time in counseling and then leaves. More probable scenario is he puts on enough of a show she ends up staying for another few years. Wasting more time when she could be happy and clothed. 

I also hate the ""tried everything"" argument. That's valid sometimes. But she's spent 14 years trying to make him care and he doesn't. She tried counseling and he refused to go with. She's put everything into this relationship and he clearly hasn't. He's only willing now because his cushy life where someone else does all the household management is about to come crashing down. SHE has tried everything. She does not owe him the chance for him to put in a modicum of effort when she has given him 14 years' worth of chances and he failed to take any of them."
You guys don‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre ready to get married. You seem to resent her already.
"If he can't have difficult conversations with his ex, and shut down with you on this, I think you've got a good sightline into what a marriage would look like."
Make your own friends. Get your own life. Get a new bf. Clearly neither of you is happy.
"Yeah, WTF. All the top comments are focusing on the fiancee wanting to spend insane amounts of money but all are dismissing the fact that OP likely doesn't want to get married at all given the general tone of the post. This expensive wedding is going to end in an equally expensive divorce :/"
"Did you pick up after yourself before she asked?
Did you bathe your son once a week before she asked?

It can be very draining to be responsible for reminding another adult to pull their weight.

How old is your son? 
Needing everything to be done a certain wait could be a sign of PPD."
She‚Äôs only six months in.  Honestly?  I think she should be happy he showed his true colors before she wasted a lot of time on him and just move on.
"EMDR therapy for PTSD. 

Changed my life. I had anxiety starting at age four, depression and suicidal ideation at eight. 

Some of it is genetic, most of it was my parents abusing or neglecting me. 

I thought I was a lost cause. I‚Äôd done I could to be a stable person into my 20s. But the PTSD, regular night terrors and consistent underlying anxiety/depression lingered and made everything harder than it needed to be. 

I also think talk therapy is a must in this case. OP is gonna have to set some hard boundaries like I did. 

‚ÄúMom, I do not appreciate being badgered about my weight. I need you to drop it. If you can‚Äôt do that, I will have to leave/ask you to leave.‚Äù

Also, someone like this should not get to share your home until they improve ... hotels, air bnb‚Äôs and extended stays are worth the money when your family still abuses you as an adult."
