"If they didn't want you there I can assure you they wouldn't have invited you, or let you work around their house. You have obviously impressed them enough to trust you and you should definitely go on the trip and enjoy yourself. Make sure you go out of your way to say thank you for the invite to both of her parents. A card and flowers probably wouldn't hurt for her mother as well. Have fun!"
"Do a Mariah: ""I don't know them.""

You wouldn't be lying, you only share genetic material with these people, that's about it. If you are asked for your opinion, you can honestly state that you were raised through foster care, because your biological parents made different choices and you worked your way up from a disadvantaged position alone. They can share their perspective, you can share your own. He said/she said, but you're the owner of your side. As the person who's achieving things in the media, your story will be more emphasized."
"Don't say anything to him. 

Keep the professional relationship, keep sending him gigs that you would have before (I'm assuming they're one you're not interested in/incapable of doing?), and hopefully he keeps sending some your way.

Just never use him as a reference again.

Easy peasy."
"My ex-husband did this while we were married. Refused to go to a Christmas party with me, then locked the screen doors from the inside.  Wouldn't answer the doorbell.  Had to go around to the backyard in the mud, unlock the side garage door.  When I opened the door to the house he answered it with a gun in his hand and said he thought I was a burglar!  Yeah, one who rings the doorbell!  This was just one of the stupid games he would play.  I say leave &amp; never look back.  He will never stop playing these head games with you. He is emotionally abusive!!!"
"""Boyfriend, I bought that switch for myself with my own money and I was willing to share it with you because I thought we'd be able to share it peacefully. That isn't happening now, so I will need to take my Switch back and you cannot have access to it anymore. I will also give you back the $100 you gave me for the switch, but if you can't respect the fact that this switch is mine, I can't let you use it anymore."""
"""I like the painting but the price is too high for me, sorry. That's why I asked for a quote before you started the work. When you told me not to worry about that, you gave off the impression you were going to charge me a price within my budget, but what you are asking of me isn't. I'm sorry but I can't afford it.""

Obviously this would never have happened in a business transaction. This is really on the friend for not giving a quote, or even a ball-park amount."
"\&gt; I text him at one letting him know I was in a cab on my way home. He told me not to bother and that he'd bolted the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd consider that an unforgivable sin. This is not fixable IMO. Normal people do NOT do this to their partners. He appears to have been trying to punish you for staying out too late. I'd book a flight home and cross him completely out of your life."
Go to the funeral and never return.
"The disparity here is astounding.  You've been married for 9 years and are still working on different goals without being  financial partners.   You value the debt free life and he values...what?
 
Do you live with an agreed upon budget?  Do you have any joint financial goals?   This is just the tip of the iceberg, you need to get into some sort of financial planning course because if you don't, you will become yet another couple for whom financial incompatibility ranks as the primary reason for divorce."
"You are being way too much of a pushover. The switch is yours. Don't let him guilt you over it. If he pulls the ""now I will have nothing to do"" shit, Tell him to get a fucking hobby then. You aren't responsible for his entertainment. He is being a gigantic baby and I honestly have no clue why you are putting up with it. Just take the switch back give him his 100 back and tell him that since he can't adhere to the original agreement you aren't going to be sending him the switch any longer. He has way overstayed his welcome. If he is a baby about then break up with him and date an actual adult."
"“I have enough to pay my bills and give him leftover money if he needs it”

Why would he ever need your money? Does he not make his own?"
Mariah has weirdly gotten me through so much. I know she had a lot of issues as well.
"Just a note from the other side... I’m not super rich, but I have a few friends with much less. 

I like to go to expensive restaurants, and occasionally share that with a friend who normally couldn’t afford it on the regular. The thing is, it’s really not a lot of money for me, so I’m not making a huge sacrifice to pay his way. I just enjoy his company and like to see him enjoy the good cheese board! 

The injustice of our income disparity makes me uncomfortable, much more than giving up a hundred bucks does.

I guess I’m trying to say, be grateful for being chosen to be included, but realize the scale of the financial gift may not be that large, to them. So don’t hesitate to accept it. It’s a good deal for everyone.

This is probably unnecessary advice, but don’t draw attention to the price of things or how the price makes you feel — no “OMG I can’t believe this, it’s AMAZING, wow I’d never be here if not for you guys!” Or “A $15 margarita are you SERIOUS!!?” Bringing up that disparity just leads to discomfort. 

But enjoy it like the vacation it is! If it’s the best margarita you’ve ever had, say so. If the view from the hotel is gorgeous, say so... and let them vicariously enjoy treating you to something valuable
— not valuable because it costs a lot, but valuable because you actually enjoy it, just like they do."
"&gt; But i’m lost on what to do 

Why are you lost?  You just pick it up and take it with you, and ignore his childish sulk/tantrum when he throws it.  Seriously...this is very very simple.  You say ""I'm taking the switch home now since it's been here for months and I would like to use it more often.  See you later!  Love you!"""
"This may seem difficult, but in a calm voice, just say to them ""I would prefer if you didn't touch me, no offense, I just don't like casual touching"". If they try again or make any excuses just say you don't want to get into why you don't like it, that it isn't a judgement against them, but that it makes you uncomfortable. If they from this point continue to try and justify themselves, it is actually not casual touching and they're a jerk."
"You can't control their actions, only your own. Block and ignore, and if someone you talk to (either at work, a friend's house, the grocery store) mentions something your parents etc may have said, you can just say: ""That's not a truthful account of events, sadly. They abandoned me as a young child leaving me in foster care. The fact they are now trying to take credit for my success that is 100% of my own making is sickening and like kicking someone when they're already down. Not sure why everyone seems to believe their fantasies."""
"You have been with this guy for 7 years?  Men and women were both at the party (including the hosts, bf and gf)?  He should have invited you.  It was really rude to UNINVITE you, and you are completely justified to tell him never to bring up this party again.    I'm sort of at a loss for words how rude this was..."
forget about it. leave him. this isn’t worth it. he is engaged and you are his side piece.
"Stop apologising for who you are and where you come from by thinking that you’re not worthy of going on vacation or being apart of their lives. They invited you because they want you there, go have a great time with your girlfriend! If they thought less of you they wouldn’t have invited you - don’t apologise, just say thank you."
"Side rant... I'm upset on your behalf that he told you while you were at work.  I was engaged to be married many years ago, and my fiance showed up unexpectedly at my office to break it off with me.  I never understood why he couldn't wait a few more hours until I got home and do it in private.  But no, all my co-workers and my boss got a front-row seat to see me ugly snot-cry.  It's like a layer of cruelty slathered over an already upsetting situation.    


I wish you peace and clarity despite your pain."
definitely tell her. she’s living a lie
"Put your questions in email. Even the ones you would normally just ask. If he doesn't answer in a reasonable amount of time, email him again. After two strikes, you cc the boss and ask again saying that his lack of response if affecting your ability to get your work done."
You need to have broken up with her hours ago.
"Him asking you for money and manipulating you to feel guilty if you dont is pretty fucked up on his end.

He’s using you... for many things. If you stay with this POS you will not get to decide how your life goes, he will decide it for you"
"Hey sis, just so you know the abortion pill looks exactly like a miscarriage. You take one in the office and the rest at home and it basically induces miscarriage. In case you don’t feel safe telling him about getting an abortion, or you can’t leave right away. 

I used to work at a women’s clinic and we screened every woman for intimate partner violence because getting a woman pregnant is a tactic for abusive men. So women with unwanted pregnancies tended to be at higher risk of violence. 

You sound so brave and like you’ve got your head on straight about this! Even if you’re not sure what actually happened, suspecting that someone COULD HAVE TAMPERED WITH CONTRACEPTION is a big enough reason to leave. And FYI you never need any “reason” to leave—you can always leave for any reason, or no clear reason at all. 

Good luck!"
"&gt;I think this is justifiable reason to just leave him. 

Yup. This is who he is. Don't marry this man, he will not make you happy.

&gt;I don't know what I did wrong

You did nothing wrong, he's just an abuser and that's what they do: abuse people.

Seriously, get out. I know he's not like this all the time, and when things are good they are great, but this is just the start. It will not get better, only worse. If you stay you will continue feeling like you walk on egg shells, never knowing if what you so will set him off, never feeling good enough. He will isolate you from your family and friends. He will keep you financially controlled and dependent on you. He will belittle you, scream at you and threaten you. Then he will become physical. Rarely at first, and he will apologize and love bomb and promise it won't happen again. Until the next time it happens, where he will blame you for setting him off. 

This story has been told so many times before. Please don't let yourself become another one of these stories. Get out while you can."
"Hmmm if you’re big enough maybe get into a charity for foster kids and when asked why, say that your experience with parents who didn’t want you influenced you to help kids who are also stuck in the system."
"I agree——impressed! I bet there over the Ken boys who come around with their daddy’s money and have no ethic! You don’t have money but you have what money can’t buy, and they recognize that."
"&gt; A screaming match ensued with him threatening divorce. 

This goes a lot deeper than the car. Srlsy, you're supposed to be a team and buying a car should be a joint decision.

Time for him to get back and for you to find a couple's counselor."
The point of giving it back is to remove any form of leverage he may use on her. If she doesn't give it back he'll keep using it as a reason.
"&gt;I will also give you back the $100 you gave me for the switch, but 

Fuck this, he has gotten his money's worth after 8 months."
Locking you out when you present no threat to him is abusive and petty behavior. This relationship is clearly over.
"100% end the relationship and get an abortion. You deserve much better than everything I just read, that is so disturbing I’m sorry you had to date someone like this for your first relationship. Take those red flags very seriously and end the relationship PLEASE. You do not owe him anything and I recommend you do abortion and breakup ASAP, make sure you have a support system for after your abortion as it can be a bit sad and painful and just ya lots of emotion or none but you should have your mom or friend or sister I don’t know I hope you have someone 💓."
"Also, like let's be real. OP left at 10pm. How is 1am even late in that context?"
"&gt;Would it be immature of me to tell him I don't really want to hear about the event?

Not at all. Immature would be being passive aggressive. Communicating your feelings in an open, honest and respectful way isn't immature. Your feelings here are valid and very understandable. You've already highlighted exactly what you could say:

""I'm fairly new to the country and have expressed how I'm struggling to meet new people and make friends here as an expat. I don't get to do a ton of stuff like this anymore as I don't know a ton of people, and the event would have been a great opportunity to meet new people. We, as a couple do a lot of things together so I can understand if \[you\] wanted a few days with just \[your\] friends but I felt like this particular event wasn't the right one to do so. So I was hurt that \[you\] no longer felt like \[you\] could bring me along despite 40 people being at this event.

\[I appreciate that you\] apologized for doing this but the 2 days \[you were\] gone sucked especially when \[you\] kept sending me photos and whatnot of the party. I know \[you may have been\] doing this because \[you\] just genuinely want to tell me about \[your\] trip. I'm doing my best to be interested in hearing about it, and move on from the fact that I was uninvited. But if I'm honest, I don't really want to keep hearing about how much fun \[you\] had at a party while I was trying to distract myself from the fact that I was uninvited to something fun I could have gone to."""
"So then don't have the baby, and don't stay with this creep. 

The fact that he reacted to your EXTREMELY reasonable concern with anger tells me that he knows exactly what he did and exactly why he did it. Do not give him what he wants. Get the abortion and stay away from him."
"This is rape. Plain and simple. This is not a gray area. He had sex with you without your consent.

You need to get yourself far away from this man. Someone who is willing to rape you when they think you are passed out is not a safe person to be around."
"He’s been open and honest with you, time to be open and honest with him. 

“You say you don’t want a relationship, which is your choice. I do want a relationship, so if that’s not with you, it needs to be with someone else. I’m not prepared to waste my time waiting for you to decide if I’m worth it or not.”"
"Honestly, this is one of those topics that the more you dig the more disillusioned you'll become. It turns out that most people will condone things in friends that they claim to disagree with so long as that person is generally nice or even just neutral or even just familiar to them. 

This becomes most frightening when someone reveals that they have been on the receiving end of a crime by someone, let's say they were sexually assaulted by someone. Just watch as the assaulter's friends leap to the defence of the one who committed the crime. There could be video evidence and the friends will still try and twist it away from them. Heck, the crime could be the distribution of photos or videos that the victim didn't consent to and then the victim blaming will begin. 

And yeah, it is scary. It is a huge problem. People default to maintaining the status quo. Friends and family will suggest people stay in toxic or outright abusive relationships so as not to cause a fuss. I've seen people who have had their lives ruined by cheating, completely destroying their ability to trust people, still support and defend a friend who cheats. It's like a glitch occurs in our thinking. And maybe part of it is that many people really are terrified to take a stand, or risk being wrong and ostracised, so the status quo becomes the benchmark that you can default to and feel comfortable and there is something to protect. 

Anyway, that was a weird rant. I guess it is something I've seen in play recently. Your boyfriend's attitude is disappointing but depressingly common. He won't stand up for his values, he will condone things he finds tasteless because he is a coward. I suppose you have to decide for yourself if you will condone that hypocrisy, if you will be the kind of person that rocks the boat. Though note: there is plenty of danger in that as well."
I refuse. Especially after this. There is no excuse. I don't think I can forgive him for this.
"I also treat my own house ""like a hotel"" in that I come and go when I please. He wants you to obey him, it isn't about the house but power and control.   


He had the conversation for you. Long distance clearly isn't working."
"So he locks you out in the middle of the night, with zero concern for your safety and well-being. Let that sink in. He did not care about your safety in the middle of the night. Is that someone you really want to work things out with? That would be a deal-breaker for me. I'd be done. I wouldn't even wait to talk to him after work. I'd pack my stuff and go."
Reach out to someone closer to them than you - maybe his mom. Say you want to help and ask what they need.
"I'm really confused by why she hasn't taken the Switch back already.  All he does is go silent when you start to leave with it?  That's perfect, just continue leaving."
"Why does she hate you? 
From the little you’ve said, I’m guessing he used you to make her insecure during their marriage and now he’s using her to make you insecure during your relationship."
It wasn't without your express or prior consent so it was a violation. He used your unconscious (he thought) body for sex without your permission. This is not OK behavior.
"OMG get the fuck out girl.  This dude is a shithole dad waiting to happen.

You deserve a partner that takes care of you as much as you take care of him.  And you DEFINITELY deserve a partner that respects your right to your body.

It's gonna be hard as hell - losing your support, losing your sex life, going through an abortion w/o a partner.  But it's so much better than the alternative: living with a needy, whiny baby who's not gonna lift a finger to help you with the infant he saddled you with."
"He's 30, terrible in bed, doesn't even seem to want to talk to you, won't have mutually satisfying sex with you and puts his (coke) friends first. There are candy bars that will give you more satisfaction than dating this man. 

You need to dump him and seek therapy for why you are accepting this dismal ""relationship."" He made a comment that made you extremely self-conscious? Sounds like he knows exactly how to prey on what you're uncertain about. ""Not overly generous in bed"" is absolutely not what you described - that's a partner who will make you uncomfortable (going in dry?) rather than take one goddamn minute to pay attention to the person he should love. 

Break up. I know you care about him, but you deserve someone who appreciates and loves you. He's not there. Doubt he will get there."
"Stop having sex you don't want! Now all of your associations with sex are painful ones because most of the sex you've had in the past few years has been undesired. I know it doesn't seem painful/bad to do it the first few times, partially because of familiarity (ie, the GOOD associations you had built up from years of good sex). But it will only get more difficult, and I think at that point, him losing weight will not be enough to recover it. You need to go to therapy, you both need marriage counseling, and you need to be honest with him."
The only time someone says that is when they want to purposefully implode the relationship.
"Go to your manager and be straight up about the work environment. If they don't help, go to your corporate HR."
"She's shown you that she's a liar and can't be trusted. When someone tells you who they are, listen.

Going forward, be pleasant and superficially friendly toward her at work but don't discuss any personal details of your life with her.  And don't trust her with any of your important work responsibilities.  For instance, if you have to submit a report to C, make sure to send it via email so you have proof it was submitted.

Also, don't hang out with her outside of work, friend her on social media, etc...  You don't want her as a friend."
"&gt; my mother is **super Christian**

&gt;  my mom was using **words like 'slut'** to describe my SO.

&gt; My dad opened the conversation up by talking about **'dating leagues.'** He basically said she wasn't in my league and I could do better, and hinted that we should break up. The reason my dad probably said this is **because my SO is part Japanese,** and my dad said, a while back, that he never saw asain people as being that attractive. 

Your parents are sexist, misogynistic, bigoted, prejudiced assholes. Sorry, but it's true. 

You need to decide if you are going to go along with their bigotry and sexism or love who you love. 

There's a slight chance they may start to like her more if get to know her, but overcoming their built-in prejudices will be nearly impossible."
"He works at his dad's law firm as like a paper filer, for lack of a better term. He literally just files papers and his dad pays him like 17 bucks an hour or something...he always blows his money super fast and makes me feel guilty when I can't give him extra money. I think his parents still pay his bills too but I'm not 100% sure"
"&gt;I have a really hard time opening up this part of my life to my therapist

&gt;I really need to confront this issue.

You know what you need to do. Talk to your therapist about this."
"You have no job, so it’s easy. Ask BIL to buy you a plane or bus ticket (or gas money if you have a car), and never look back. Live with them while you find a job and apartment. You’ll want to raise your future kids near her future family anyway. Go home - and sister is your home. So sorry for this terrible loss. Dump this loser."
"Please create your own savings account and transfer your money there. This is very, very risky financially, and it's not okay that he's hiding the account information from you. You should not have money for yourself in an account that doesn't have your name on it."
Change the door code yesterday and be thankful it's cheaper than changing locks.
"So you’re definitely not on the newest lease, right? And the landlord isn’t doing a walkthrough, it’s just R that wants to do one with you? If both of those things are correct, then I would just completely walk away from this situation. Make sure the landlord knows you’re not renewing your portion of the lease, don’t try to sublet &amp; just eat the cost of that one month, eat the cost of your security deposit, &amp; make sure you end service on all utilities in your name. Then text R that you cleaned your own areas &amp; are not coming back to clean more, &amp; that she needs to set up utilities in her own name before X date because they’re coming out of your name as of that day."
Looks like you should refuse to marry him.
"My girlfriend's ex was similar. Would refuse the invitation to go out with friends, then bolt the door when she would go alone. Would spray her in the face with cleaning products if she slept in. Pulled a gun on her when she tried to call it off - then later said he wasn't threatening her, he was threatening to use it on himself! Like that's better. She called the cops, they took his guns away and he got admitted. She hasn't seen him in person since.

Folks, if someone threatens suicide, call the cops. It's either a manipulation tactic and they need consequences, or they are serious and need help."
Have you talked to him about the fact that he agreed you would move out of this town and now he is going back on his word? What would need to happen for him to feel comfortable moving?
"Do not tell him you got an abortion.  If you can pull it off, just tell him you misscarried.  Believe me - it will save you a WORLD of pain."
"Honestly, I wouldn’t bother. That was super tacky and lousy on Jake’s part, but it didn’t hurt you, and you got the job. You’ve got your dream job, congratulations! There’s really nothing to be gained from calling Jake out. Just do a slow fade and keep him as a professional contact."
"Be ready for him to realize he went too far, and come back love-bombing you and full of excuses about how he was stressed or how “that wasn’t the real him.”

That *was* the real him, the one he tried to keep hidden so you’ll stay on the hook. His mask slipped."
Your SO comes off like an asshole.
"Recording conversations to learn to communicate better may be a good idea. In this case you would have your fight and listen to the recording together *later* once you've resolved the issue and calmed down, e.g. a couple of days later to ensure you both have a bit of distance and can be more objective about it. 

Recording conversations to prove who is right is a terrible idea. It's just more fuel to the fight because then you will just argue about ""but *you* said... what I *meant* was""."
"Wow that's s really good idea. I hadn't thought to get everything in writing, my office is really casual and everyone generally just goes to talk to each other. But I'll definitely start that"
"If your son still lives at home you can ban her from your home.

But that's really all you can do. You've told him that you disapprove, you've told her that you disapprove, that's all. You've spoken your piece."
"In a similar vein, sing the praises of those that did support and nurture you. Teachers, mentors, friends, etc. Talk about how they were there for you when nobody else was."
"don't involve yourself in a ”he said she said” situation because, trust me, people will pile up the dirt even more onto you, and YOU will look like the trouble maker. 

carry on doing your thing, stay in your lane, focus on your life and success, and continue cutting them off.

you cannot win with the people. and those outside the circle won't be convinced of you put things in perspective."
"I agree. Unless someone absolutely betrays you, its better not to burn bridges in the professional world."
"Yeah... when I read this story I think the person behaving most reasonably here is the ex.

You should not have been allowed to meet the kids this early, period.  After a divorce kids need a lot of stability- they're supposed to go ages without meeting the first 'boyfriend of mom, girlfriend of dad' type figures.  It's to keep them from re-bonding and then being traumatized when a casual relationship doesn't work out.

You should DEFINITELY not be playing alone with them.  You know you're not a pedophile; *she* doesn't know you're not a pedophile and he's right to be furious.

He should not have been blindsided by finding out his partner was dating, he should have been included in the conversation of how and when to introduce you to the children.

This woman isn't taking the emotional health or physical safety of her children seriously- and it sounds like she's being hideously thoughtless with the emotional health of her ex partner."
Oh I love this! I was finding it hard to word it. I didnt want to sound bitter or horrible.  :D
"You’ve only been dating three weeks? Been on four dates? And you’ve already met her kids and have spent the night there while the kids are there? Big yikes.

Then you find out that she’s lying to you? Her divorce isn’t even final yet? Even bigger yikes.

Get out now. You’ve not put in enough time that it’ll hurt either of you if you call time on the relationship. This is just one massive red flag after another."
No they're not red flags. They're deal breakers. . . all of em.
I glanced at the ages I guess. She's nearly fucking 50. I would feel no hesitation cutting the bills.
"It sounds like your parents would benefit from therapy. Watching someone you love suffer from abuse is traumatic as well, they are understandably fearful but are reacting in a way that can be detrimental to your sister. It's great she's dating and continuing to live her life.

My suggestion is to explain that to them and see if they'd be open to therapy. But be clear that you support your sister and will not talk to her about being single. Their fear should not dictate her life, and they should not ask you to do something like this again."
"7 year itch. Wanted to sleep with someone else and not feel guilty about it. He probably thought he could use the “we were on a break”, “being with her made me realise exactly what I have with you”, “don’t throw away 7 years over 1 mistake” bs and get back with OP after having his cake. 
Don’t be guilted into taking him back OP, he knew exactly what he was doing and exactly what he would be throwing away."
"My ex husband didn’t believe me until the divorce was final, and I put the house on the market. He didn’t even show up for court. If you really want the divorce file the papers and get on with your life. If you’re waiting for a reaction from him, you seem to be wasting your time."
"Honestly, the only thing you can really do is talk to him about it. I’d say if you’re uncomfortable with expressing your feelings to him, even if you feel ridiculous, then there’s another problem there. Hopefully, if approached correctly without initially pointing fingers, he will understand your concern and reassure you of one way or another. Or, he’ll come out and be honest with you about seeing her a particular way. 

You really just have to talk with him. Otherwise, your anxiety will only create more assumptions."
"I am astounded that not only did he not take you... But that he uninvited you. Completely blown away by his lack of empathy, common courtesy, and decorum."
"I had a similar issue, my parents taking credit for something they actually blocked and set me back 10 years. I had so many plans to expose them, but ultmately the answer is ignore them. Ask yourself: what do you *really* care what people think about them? Sure, it's annoying but it can only annoy you *if you give it head space*"
Should i tell her?
"Because making excuses is a part of how we work socially. You don't always have to be the boldest, most assertive version of yourself. Hedging and couching language are super useful ways to help others save face and keep social bonds strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm not saying she NEEDS to make an excuse, but that's the answer to the question ""Why make excuses?"")"
"My story is very similar to yours, only I would be the forgotten sister in this situation. I think it's sweet that you are empathizing with your siblings situation. My dad straight up deleted me out of his life once he found a new family when I was about 7 years old. He never talked to me again after that. I have a lot of emotional damage from the situation, but my life turned out good regardless. I think it would be nice of you to reach out to your sister. It's ok to love your dad, because he was good to you, while also losing some respect for him not contacting his other kids. Adults aren't perfect and sometimes they make wrong choices. But we can still love them for it. Good luck."
"Jesus, how many red flags do you need to see before you break it off with this guy!?!?

&gt; He was actually 32 at the time, so not a recent undergrad, and he also seemed to forget to mention that he was in the middle of a divorce.

**Liar**

&gt; He also appears to be in competition with his ex-wife, always looking her up on social media and showing me what’s she’s up to in disgust, then posting about his “younger, fresher, and hotter girl” making sure she or someone close to her has a way to see it.

**Stalker**

&gt; he gets very angry with people interacting with me. 

**Anger management problems**

&gt; He is very much into gender roles in the sense that he was to protect and provide for me and all that. 

**Sexist**

&gt; He also wants sex a lot. It’s physically draining for me 

**Sexually abusive**

&gt; He is always buying me gifts and flowers.

Look up ""love bombing"". He does this so you overlook all the other bad things he does. 

Get the fuck away from this guy as soon as possible. And be ready for him to big time stalk you after you break up. Super toxic."
"I guess I'm going against the grain, but I think it would be kind and not-harmful to send an email or letter. Something written out, and make it clear you don't want a back and forth (and don't get dragged into one). 

I say this because of two things that stick out from your post...

*  You say you were giving her lots of assurances that things were fine in the days leading up to the break up
* You admit it came out of nowhere for her, and then you were vague during the breakup itself not providing any reasons 

Maybe I have more sympathy because I've been broken up with in a similar way (out of nowhere, no reasons given, assurances prior to the breakup) and it really fucked with my ability to trust in peoples feelings for me for like...years after the fact. You can drive yourself crazy wondering what happened. I don't see the harm in telling her that there actually WAS a reason for the breakup, and what she did that was off-putting. 

That said you don't OWE her anything, but IMO it's the kind thing to do. Just don't get wrapped up into going back-and-forth with her if she tries to bargain back into a relationship with you. Send the email, tell her you're firm and your decision and don't want to discuss it more, and block if necessary."
"&gt;I've had guys try to completely destroy my life socially after being rejected in a way that upset them to much, so the unfortunate fact is I have to avoid them getting butthurt in this particular situation. 

I just want to say that this isn't your fault and those guys were assholes.

My suggestion is to just tell him the next time he does it to not do that. Like, not loud in front of everyone, but maybe say in a soft voice ""Please don't touch me on the arm or shoulder like that, thanks!"""
"When my husband and I were younger, my parents paid for both of us to come on a vacation with a bunch of our extended family. My husband made them one of those online photo albums of the trip when we got back as a thank you, and they still talk about how much they loved it. Definitely go, have fun, and do something inexpensive but thoughtful for them to thank them!"

"How does he feel about not having had sex for 6 months? That is a serious, serious problem and marriage is only going to exacerbate the issue. Call off the wedding"
"A couple of things:

&gt; instead of helping me to the hose, Makes me crawl my blind, pain ridden ass back to the hose

A good person doesn't do this.  A malicious, cruel person does this.  Don't be with a malicious, cruel person.

&gt;  if I push to break up with my girlfriend

You don't push to break up with someone, you just break up.  That is a single-party decision and the other person gets no say.  You don't need evidence, other people's opinions, or anyone's approval besides your own."
He started that conversation in an effort to stop you from going out..
"This this this this this \^\^\^\^  


He ENDANGERED your life by locking you OUTSIDE from your SHARED home. He enacted unlawful eviction out of spite. He broke the LAW to harm YOU.   


Since you were LDR it should be easy to seperate from him. Get your things. Say nothing to him. The relationship is over because you deserve better than a man who jeopardizes your life out of pettiness. What if your friend couldn't take you in? Would you be in a shelter? What if the shelter had no beds? Would you be out in the street without any form of protection from harm, or the elements?   


The second you moved in together that was no longer just his home. He has no control over that door, but he's trying to while he tries to control you.   


If you heard this story from a friend, about her boyfriend locking her out in the dead of night from their home, while continuing to refuse her entry, would you tell her you think this is a communication error, or would you be angry on her behalf while you thought about all that could have happened to her? Be your own friend. Ditch this guy."
"&gt; Obviously this would never have happened in a business transaction. This is really on the friend for not giving a quote, or even a ball-park amount.

So much this. People really need to stop doing weird ass things like this. So nonsensical."
"People that expect you to ""forgive and forget"" are projecting their own fear. If you have and keep boundaries with bio mom then you can easily do it to step mom. 

Step mom wants to see you break so she has no fear of mistakes. It's all selfishness."
"My boyfriend ‘hid’ a ‘friendship’ with a girl for over 3 months. He accidentally mentioned her name, and then admitted to having her in his life, but said he ‘didn’t want to tell me because I would be upset’. He reiterated over and over that ‘they were just friends’. 
When the truth finally came out, after 6 months of lies and manipulation from his side, it turned out he had been emotionally cheating on me for many months, and then physically cheating on me for a week. 
Trust your gut feeling. Don’t be naive."
"Not weird at all. 


My best friend has two very different friend groups. One is us, another consists of people from her uni (artsy bunch). She did try to make us meet once and it was... really bad. We didn’t vibe with that group at all. I don’t feel angry towards her for separating us because she must clearly know that we wouldn’t get along. 


It’s probably the same with your friend. She vibes with your friend group, but probably assumed that you wouldn’t vibe with the other group and it’s cool. If it really bothers you I’d pitch an idea of making a party where two groups meet and then you’ll see."
"Honestly - leave it 
You have tried but she is being absolutely ridiculous with her ""you know what you did"" crap.

There are times when it is best to just walk away. You are leaving the workplace so never need to interact with her again so you can leave her to her little drama.
Just remove her from your Facebook and leave her to it. No friendship is that important it is worth such hassle."
Your boyfriend is an adult. He can buy his own switch if he desperately “needs” one.
"That is really messed up and uncomfortable. I would be very cool to her in the future. Don’t be rude. Don’t let it impact your work. If she asks why say that since she lied and laughed at you, you’d like to keep discussions work related."
"What she did was cruel. Who the fuck does that. More importantly, who conditioned you to accept that kind of disrespect and cruelty towards you? Seriously, you forgive her and she will, in due time, do other things.  Fuck that shit man. Don't start putting up with this BS now."
"&gt; “the difference is i would cheat and he wouldn’t”  

Why are you still with someone who would say this to you??

Have some self respect and leave this turd."
"I thought the same thing. Either he should've told her he wanted to continue the conversation now or postponed it until the morning. Stewing in unsaid resentment and then punishing her for not reading his mind is ridiculous, childish and cruel. I'd leave and never look back, that's no way to even treat a mere acquaintance."
"&gt; the people that are his friends stick around

People stick around heroin, too; that doesn't mean it's a good idea.

&gt; during any argument he reminds everyone how much he does for the other person. Almost like you don't have grounds to be upset or disappointed.

This is an abuse tactic. 

Your boyfriend is showing narcissistic behaviors (changing someone *else's* birthday dinner plans, *twice*, to suit himself, rather than accommodating the person who is having the birthday), as well as abusive behaviors (gaslighting you into thinking that because he's done good stuff, you have no reason to be upset by the bad stuff; punishing you for not complying with his whims by telling you to go away).

Your boyfriend is not boyfriend material, and the sooner you come to terms with that and kick him to the curb, the sooner you can find someone *worth* being with."
"Okay, I hear that you want to handle this quietly and be understanding toward him. I don't think he particularly deserves a bunch of chances, but since you want to give them to him, that could look like this.

Next time he does it: ""Hey friend, I'd rather you didn't touch my arm like that, thanks for understanding!"" Then turn back to whatever the conversation was before that.

This is pleasant, direct, assumes his cooperation, and does not make A Confrontation out of it.

When he does it again (because let's be real here, this is happening): ""Whoa man, I asked you to stop touching me."" You can combine this with moving away.

This draws attention to the fact that HE is the one making it weird and crossing boundaries.

If it happens a third time, continue to move away or deflect his hand and say: ""Dude, this is the third time I've had to ask you not to touch me. Stop it.""

Again, draws attention to the fact that he is intentionally crossing your boundaries after having been warned. Removes his plausible deniability, shows that he is the one being a jerk and a creep.

Any subsequent times: ""I SAID STOP TOUCHING ME!""

Because you did, and if he's still doing it at this point, he is openly being a creep, and you're allowed to react like he's a creep, because he is."
"This has nothing to do with being transgender. You aren't sexually compatible. That happens with all sexes. You are not attracted to him sexually. Just because someone is transgender doesn't mean they have a right to date someone that's not into them. 
Nobody owes anyone anything. You dated. You are not attracted to him anymore. Done"
Yeah it almost sounds like this guy has manipulated both of these women so he could basically go back n forth between them. OP needs to be done with this guy regardless what he said was fucked up.
"Also- wow this is a horrible red flag! Imagine if you split on a car, a house? Pay attention to this."
"Silver linning: You're only 25, and you guys didn't get married or have kids. Good luck"
"It's not your job to ease her stress.  

This is her using emotional manipulation in an attempt to control you, and when you change your behaviors in order to ""calm her"", she is getting what she wants, and you are training her that her manipulation is working, which will encourage her to do it *more*.

You are not responsible for making sure that an adult woman properly handles an adult situation.  

Remain calm, do not allow yourself to get drawn into her drama, and continue with your plans.

She will get worse before she gets better, because she will see that the control tactics that have been working until now have stopped, so she'll escalate in an attempt to draw you back in.  If you stand firm, she'll eventually figure out that it's not working and is a waste of time, and she'll back down."
Definitely red flags galore... she seems to be super insecure and to be honest she will try and make you choose between her or your friends.  Your relationship is in the very beginning stages if I were you I would break up with her
"Grey rock. Bore her out of poking at you.

""I'm fine, thank you very much.""

""No, I'm fine, thank you very much.""

""Thank you for your concern. I'm fine."""
"You're not overreacting, it's a red flag that he can't accept your boundaries and autonomy without trying to throw a pity party for himself. Even if he couches it as a joke, it's a joke that comes at the expense of your comfort, security and feeling of safety."
Maybe OP should let her therapist read the post. She's already gotten the words out so might as well show them to the therapist so flood gates open.
"Women are conditioned to be polite, to not hurt others feelings, to not cause a fuss. This is why he's doing this. He's taking advantage of your unwillingness to cause a scene so he can get away with this. So, cause a fucking scene if you have to. 

First time, ""hey dude, don't touch me"" leave out the ""please"" and the ""no offense."" You're not the one being unreasonable here. He'll probably be all flustered and offended but just ignore it. Don't justify your boundary. 

""Well I was just being friendly"" ""I don't like being touched. Don't touch me.""

 ""It's not that big a deal!"" ""I don't like being touched. Don't touch me."" 

""You didn't say anything about before!"" ""I'm saying something about it now. Don't touch me."" 

Second time, ""I told you not to touch me, what is your problem?"" 

Third time, make a SCENE, ""I TOLD YOU THREE TIMES NOT TO TOUCH ME!!'

He's the one making things awkward, not you. He should feel embarrassed, not you"
He specifically didn’t tell her about you because he likes her. This is a pretty huge deliberate breach of trust and you should be calling off the engagement.
"&gt;	...wouldn’t  answer the doorbell. Had to go around to the backyard in the mud, unlock the side garage door. When I opened the door to the house he answered it with a gun in his hand and said he thought I was a burglar! 

Maybe I’m  reading too much into this, but idk, this sounds like a set up for a great *excuse* or *alibi* for shooting you. Reading made me ill, but I’m so glad you got away!!! 

Wtf is with these people like OP’s and your ex? It’s like * Ok you made me vulnerable and scared...Do you feel better now, shit stain?* 

Personally, I hope people with this behavior start getting shut out of the dating pool. We’d all be better without them collectively."
So he has plenty of money and no bills and you still pay for his shit? This guy is a loser. Ditch his sorry ass.
"Yeah this is bad

·previous struggles with finance (likely with husband being the over spender)
·husband wants a new car even though he has a perfectly good car almost paid off
·monthlt payments are 400$???? Per month? I have a 2016 Kia forte as a new driver with bad credit and mine is 281$ from Wells Fargo. What is going on here??
·wife isn't so much mad that husband got the new car, just that he got it *that day* because she acknowledges he's going to get it regardless of her input
·but also back to, ""husband bought the car his first time looking at it in person""
·immediately turns into screaming match w/ threats of divorce
·wife is more concerned about getting her point across then emphasizing on just how unhealthy this is.


Op needs to duck out for this marriage quick. I do not advice counseling. This is man will definitely push back against that and run you financially into the ground in the mean time."
"I am a working artist and it’s really weird an unprofessional that either a set price for the painting or an hourly rate were not discussed before the artist began.  May I ask what the price was?  

Typically for a larger job I will agree on an hourly rate with the client and give an estimate before I begin painting, and then if the client wants additional revisions I always give thorough warning that the end price will be a little higher due to putting in extra hours."
"As well as cutting your mum out, you also need to address your dad. 

Why on earth did he allow you to keep going to that house to be abused? And why on earth is he allowing his damn wife to cut you out of the family and keep inviting the abusive ex-wife over? 


Your mum is no picnic, but damn, your dad failed badly too."
"So you *can* ban her from your home. You just won't.

He's 18. Of course he doesn't care about the long-term implications of fucking his mum's ex-bff. His brain isn't done developing--in general, the capacity to understand and appreciate consequences develops *last*, around 26.

Your ex-bff is the one who really bears the responsibility here, and she sounds like a bit of a trash fire. I understand that you're concerned, but he's legally an adult and so is she. The only things you can do are the things you have control over, so banning her from your home, or throwing him out. I don't think that throwing him out is going to help matters, I should say, and I don't think you should do, but really those are the limits of your ability to control this situation."
You don’t owe anyone sex or a relationship.
"Imo, when one partner locks that other out, the relationship should end. Regardless of whether the locking out someone is itself abusive action or whether the locked out one was the abusive one and locked out for safety. Even if you had been doing something really bad making him so so so angry that he finally blew, even then it should end.

Like with hitting. If you two stay, this and similar will happen again and again. Regardless of other circumstances."
"&gt;As the person who's achieving things in the media, your story will be more emphasized.

Also, she'll have (some) control over the media and what is disclosed. i.e. at least her network won't spew out sensationalistic bullshit. So if Shity Parents decide to go public (because they're assholes, so why wouldn't they), she'll at least have a network to back her up.  Having a media network on your side is a very powerful thing."
"&gt; I think my friend is on a bad track. She's 33, hates her job, wants kids, can't find a man, spends her free time partying and travelling (I think escaping). She has a normal amount of money, is not rich. And now she just ditched me, possibly the last good influence she has in her life. 

OP sounds so.... holier-than-thou. Cant find a man? Wants kids? OP is the lassssttt goood influeeencceee? Wow. Get over yourself.

What her friend she saw 3x in the last 3 years did was shitty, and I would be pissed but the judgemental reaction is kind of off-putting."
"Uhmmm if money is tight, you don’t do “fun” trips for turning 30. There’s *literally* no accomplishment to be celebrated there. His priorities need to change. When you’re both working and have 6 months expenses saved or your debts paid off, then you can both start budgeting for trips. How does he not get this. You want him to have fun after money isn’t such an issue. Also sound like he needs to give you a few weekends off"
You've been together 4 years and haven't asked him? Healthy people in healthy relationships don't wonder if something is a power play.
So you left one physically abusive guy and you're with another one now.  Why are you not running away from him already
"&gt; So, I now demanded an answer and he admits that he had been taking money out. I demanded he login so I could see, and he does.

Wow. You've been sending considerable amounts of money to an account you didn't even have the access to view without him? It's time to get that sorted. Whether you're in a relationship or not, it's always vital to have *access* to your own money. More, it's important to have *control* over your own money. This isn't the time to fret over hurt feelings, this is the time to be pragmatic and take a few measures to secure your own resources."
"i get you, you hate being the bully when you're the victim. 

but how will they affect your professional life? no impact. that's the most important thing; you have a good conscience and are raising a good son. fuck the rest. let the kid finish his school then get the eff out asap.

also you don't care about the nephews. you wouldn't have a healthy relationship with them anyways to begin with. and you owe them zero shit. they didn't earn it just like you didn't earn being thrown away as an infant.

life's tough, and these people are starting to reap what they sowed. too bad for them."
"He doesn't have to believe you for you to file for divorce. Once he sees the papers perhaps it will sink in, but even if it doesn't that's not really your problem. Go ahead and file, only speak to him if you need to do so regarding the details of the divorce or paperwork."
"This is the right answer. You are letting yourself be controlled by his behavior. Forget about what he's doing and focus on what you're doing. And don't forget to say ""i love you"" on the way out the door."
"Ohhh, fuck no. There's a reason that this dude wants to be with you: he thinks you won't know better and won't leave.

He's older than you, making more money than you, doing more drugs than you, and completely non-functional as a human. He doesn't want it to end because it's so easy to have someone who continually accepts the crumbs of affection to fuck him.

You're not only not a priority, you're not even on the list. You sound like a person with so much love to give. Don't waste that."
"At a job, your business is what your boss expects of you.

What other people are doing isn’t really your business, and if you’re not actively making us money or saving us money then you’re wasting time.

Boss asks you to do something - I don’t care if the whole team is slacking off or on break - you jump to that shit, especially when you’re a kid with little real value to offer in the working world beyond a strong back and working legs.

Your brother needs to understand it’s not a club, or a team... it’s a profit generating enterprise, and he’s there solely at the behest of the owner.  If the owner is successful, he’s good at cutting dead weight.  

Your brother is gearing up for some hard lessons, but it sounds like he doesn’t really know how to work, family business or not."
"You said you liked her when you met her. That doesn't mean you have to be enthusiastic about your dad marrying her now. 

Does she live with you now? If they get married, she's going to move in, and that will really change things in the household. You can tell your dad you're not ready for that kind of change. At least that way you don't have to address the fact that he's dating someone old enough to be your sister and it wigs you out."
Your gf is manipulating you to believe that you only need her. Do yourself a favor and break this off before it gets even more difficult to do so.
"How does Jim feel about his sister's behavior?  

He should never have said that you felt disrespected by her hanging out with the ex.  He threw you under the bus.  He should have told her how he felt about it.   

The two of you cannot tell SIL who she can or can't be friends with.  And you can't tell her who she can / can't invite to events she is organizing.  All you can do is avoid any events that will make you uncomfortable."
"&gt;He ate for free and slept for free. 

Let him know he's not getting any freebies from now on. Just go book a hotel room."
"It makes perfect sense, he was pissy she wanted to spend time with someone else, so he started an argument just as she was leaving. It didn’t prevent her from going so he said they continue the argument when she got back. This way it ruins her fun night out and implies she needs to not stay out late.

Since they didn’t get him what he wanted he locked her out as a sure fire way to punish her."
Tell her. Send her a facebook message. Make sure you have some proof. Just in case he tells her your lying.
"You need to fully commit to not responding. None of this ""i just said okay to what he said and forgot the whole thing""."
"Let me just say none of this has to do with anything you did. Sexuality is a very confusing thing and he probably genuinely did love you. I know a lot of gay folks who had straight relationships because they genuinely cared for the other person, but they confused attraction with just really liking someone as a person. I also know people who identified one one way or the other and got into a relationship the other way around (ex a straight woman in a lesbian relationship) because they understood each other more or it just felt right.

It’s understandable how you’re feeling right now, and I would chat with him about his feelings a little more. He probably does care about you, but he can’t change his sexuality. 

It will be like a grieving process and the best thing you can do is give it time like any other break up. I can’t say specifically because I’m not in the situation you’re in but communicating with him is key to helping yourself"
"&gt; Would spray her in the face with cleaning products if she slept in.

I saw a post exactly like this on this sub a few months ago."
"I'd start treating her like she treats you: stop inviting her to everything. If she still gets invited by one of your friends who is invited because they are friends with Megan too, fine. I'd also try to just make some new friends yourself :). She may get on better with some of your friends than you do (at least in their experience) so maybe that's why you aren't invited? It seems silly though if they are still all friends with you."
"Based on the fact he text you after to say does this new job mean he won’t be getting any more freelance work, I’d say it’s less that he was after your new job and more that he was trying to (badly, as it sounds) advertise himself to the new company because he thinks this move will mean he loses out on the work you have been putting his way. 

Personally I’d say just leave it. You got the job, the new manager mentioned it to you I think because he found it a bit much and probably isn’t interested in you passing freelance work to the other guy now. Jake has asked you a direct question, just answer that with something like “I’m not too sure how the new job handles freelance yet, it might not be the same setup as the old job” and just gently let him down like that."
"I cheered at your response. I do feel guilty about my nieces and nephews. I would have loved to have a fun aunt at their age and I worry about missing out on having that family I so desperately wanted for years. I was like Matilda and I prayed every night for my very own Miss Honey. 

But I don't want to set myself up for hurt. These people only contacted me when I was useful. If I had been an addict or a loser, there's no way they would be putting about that they even knew my name.  

I have no idea why I feel bad about all of this."
"Buy him out and take it back and don't let him ""borrow"" it again. He can be a big boy and get his own game system back from his friend."
"I agree with this but want to add on, don’t only say thank you (though you should do that often). 

When you get back, find a nice thank you card and write them a sincere message of thanks hitting on some of these topics:

-Mention how much it meant that they invited you and have welcomed you into their family
-Add something specific about the trip you did together you really enjoyed 
-how thankful and appreciative you are (don’t just write “thanks!”)

If you have the money, you could try to pay for dinner for them one night of the trip, though they probably won’t let you. You could also get a little trinket as a small token to give them with the thank you card."
"Doctor will only prescribe abortion pill within about 8 weeks of pregnancy and it only costs up to about $500. If you're going to go that route, GO NOW. After that abortion options are much more expensive and since you don't have health insurance, thats definitely not a good thing."
Then he can buy his own switch or use someone else's switch to play that one game.
"One of the most common issues on this sub is young people posting about manipulative or controlling relationships with older partners. The advice always includes a caveat that the older person benefits from dating a younger person by capitalizing off their naivety -- no one their own age would ever tolerate their BS. 

The same situation applies here. She is in her 40s, you're in your early 20s with less renting and roommate experience. She has taken advantage of you in a number of ways. The biggest one is her assumption that she is the true ""owner"" of the living space and other roommates are not entitled to the space. You saw her do this in the first house you lived in with her (""it became clear this was R's house"", but it sounds like she was merely a tenant, just like you). She has no more authority or entitlement to the living space than you do (or your former roommate did). You allowed it to happen. 

She either doesn't understand that she's not in charge and doesn't have any more authority than you or she is aware of it, but hopes you aren't. She can't tell you to do a ""walk-through"" with her because she does not own the place. Nor does she decide how much of your security deposit you get back (if she pulls any crap with that, take her to small claims court. That si exactly what that exists for). Just because she is two decades older than you does not mean she has any extra authority here.

Most importantly, don't let this happen again. Don't cede space to someone just because they are the loudest or bossiest or most difficult. Say no and mean it."
"Tell them up front, ""I'm not into any physical stuff on the first date. I need to feel a connection first.  That means hugs and kisses too.""  

&amp;#x200B;

If they dip, welp, saved you time and hassle.   

&amp;#x200B;

And anyone who is physically aggressive with you deserves to have their feelings hurt.   Stop worrying about that.  Once you've told them what the rules are, if they don't respect it, that's a HUGE problem with boundaries, and you can safely be awkward and hurt their feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Women are taught to please others, at the expense of their own feelings and often, safety.   Fuck that noise."
"I couldn't finish this. I'm sorry....too many red flags. The great thing is you are very self aware. So you know you're dating scum. You also know it's because of the many painful issues you've had to face throughout your young life. That's alright. But it's time to take some action. Dump him , no he does not love you, you know this. Also, seek professional help for your depression. Spending time with a therapist beats spending time with him IMO. I know it's not easy for you, but love and value yourself and believe that there is someone out there who will genuinely love you and treat you right."
"&gt;  double the maximum amount my mom was willing to pay for it.

What's the amount? I mean, if she's charging $10 and your mom was ready to pay $5 that's a big difference than say mom is ready to pay $1000 and is being charged $2000. 

The devil is in the details. So, how much?"
"This is one of those situations where you’re going to have decide what means more to you. Do you want to stay or do you want to leave? Based off the tone of your post, I think it seems you want to leave and just need the push to get there.


If you feel that strongly about it I would have discussion with your husband that goes something like this, “before we got married we said we’d leave this town. It’s been 12 years and we haven’t yet. I’ve tried in the past and I know you’ve stopped me but I’ve decided I’m not waiting any longer and am leaving whether or not you come. I’m sorry it has to come to this, and I would love for you to come with me, but I understand you may not want to and that’s fine.”


There’s a part of me that feels like your husband is one of those spouses that plays games because he doesn’t ever think you’re actually going to do anything about it. Ie, he’s never had a reasonable discussion or considered compromise because he’s certain you won’t leave, so he doesn’t have to bargain with you, he just gets what he wants by default."
"Your wife keeps on lying to you regarding her mom. She continues to choose her mom over the family you two are building together. At this point, I think you need couples counseling to try to learn to trust her again. If you cannot rebuild your trust in your wife, your marriage is as good as dead and you need to make that clear to her."
"I think you need to sit down with a manager/ two managers, and say you are concerned about communication issues, and feel that these issues are affecting your job. Make some specific examples, such as the manager not speaking to you. Tell them that you enjoy the job, you value the opportunity to work there and you want to do well, but you are getting a sense of hostility. Throw in the phrase ""I wanted to come to you first and see if we can resolve this."" Throw the problem into their lap - if they don't put a stop to this whisper campaign, they are the ones who are going to look bad. 

It's unacceptable for managers to allow this whisper campaign to go on. You're entitled to go to work without putting up with being shunned. 

Yes, this is the kind of job you can walk away from if it all gets too much, but someone should have the decency to tell you what the issue is."
"Yeah, saying ""don't worry about it"" made it sound like the friend would wind up giving it to her either for free or super heavily discounted (maybe just the cost of materials?).  So weird to say that and then charge what I assume is the normal amount (which for art can vary wildly between artists)."
"&gt; The one thing I don't understand is why neither my son, nor my would-be friend seems to care about the longer-term implications of this relationship, the time he's spending with her is leaving him little time to focus on the other aspects of his life and he often tries to cram everything he misses during the day in at night which has led to him being exhausted. 

OP.... your son is 18. Your friend groomed him into this relationship and is taking advantage of his inexperience. Right now there's nothing cooler for him than to bang a MILF, but when he's older, he'll look back and realise what an actual creep your friend was."
"Nobody NEEDS a game system. There are plenty of free games on all the app stores. And ""how?"" He just asks for it back. Just like you hand him $100 and now the switch is 100% yours and belongs only with you."
"He's being an ass because you stood up for yourself.

I seriously have an acquaintance *just* like this guy. He gets very personal and very flirty with women, but only in private. He picks women who are much younger than him an/or women going through hard times, because he knows they'll have a harder time standing up to him. Anyone who does stand up to him gets the same kind of treatment Richard is giving you; passive aggressive snips, silent treatment, and playing the victim.

He was trying to flirt with you (you already knew that) and he's butthurt that you stood up for yourself and told him to knock it off, so he's trying to ""punish"" you by making everything awkward and strained. 

I agree with people saying to look for a new job...not because of him, but because your HR department is lacking and there seems to be no recourse against toxic employees."
"&gt; She still wasn't ready to be in her new place Sunday night (still not clear to me why) so she stayed at our house again. 

I think it's clear why. Until your SO put their foot down, your MIL was going to keep taking over your space and your life. She's not independent and I don't think she was hasty as much as she was controlling and expecting people to cater to her. IMO, she knows exactly what she's doing. It's not a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

It's nice of you to rifle through everything for the silverware, but that was total bullshit. You called her bluff (and wasted a lot of time), so she came up with another excuse.

&amp;#x200B;

I bet you she's done this to your SO for most of his life. Maybe he hasn't noticed until you've started pointing it out, but it's good you're nipping that in the bud."
"Stop trying to have a baby with this guy.

Let him know there is a problem - your marriage is on the line. He comes to counseling with you now or you walk and find an adult to marry. You say he wasn't ""like this"" but he is a 30 YO who never had a job for longer than a year...I'm guessing there were some yellow flags that you chose to ignore... or not, we have no idea. But the advice still stands. You get counseling or you walk."
"He gets paid 17 an hour. You get paid 2 an hour. And you give him your money? 


Call your parents and have them come get you out of thrrr."
"Who did you pay the security deposit to - her, or the landlord?  

In response to her telling you she expects you to help clean, tell her you expect payment in full immediately for all the bills she didn't contribute to.   

I think that will stop her asking."
"I dated a guy kinda like this when I was 18, only he wasn’t 6 ft tall. He was maybe 5’ 10 at the most. He would do “little” things sometimes like just putting his entire body weight on me, preventing me from moving, even though he knew I hated this. He would “play hit” my face and act like I was the in the wrong when I got upset about it. “Little” things like this are huge red flags. Anyone who tells you they’re just joking when they hurt you does not care about you. Think about it. If he told you that you were hurting him you would stop immediately and not do it again. That’s not the case with him."
Well he's not  concerned about how you feel when he hogs the entire Switch that happens to be YOURS. Stop giving him consideration when he isn't giving you the same.
"Being fired will be the best thing to happen to your entitled brother.   Your uncle gave him a job and is paying him money to work.   Your brother doesn't seem to think that he has to actually EARN that money.  Nope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you care if your brother gets fired?   You know that he's not working, you and your cousin are working harder because he's not pulling his weight.   Your uncle doesn't owe ANYTHING to anyone, especially when it comes to his business.   He worked hard for what he has and he is not an ATM, dispensing money to family members just for existing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your brother is the asshole here and you know it.  Let your brother suffer the consequences of being a jackhole to your uncle and be fired.   Then he can find another job where it's not so cool, and see what it's like to make minimum wage and be treated shabbily."
"You tell them. He is forced to give it away. Next time he won't tell you. 

Tell your father but since he said it's behind the couch tell your dad to pretend he found it when moving the couch because he dropped his glasses or something. 

It is unsafe to be in a home with a firearm without your knowledge. Worse with someone who has anger issues. Encourage your dad to get him to leave upon discovery. Also get them a dog to help alert them if he comes around. I feel unsafe reading this."
"I'm looking into taking out a payday loan to cover the remaining cost of the plane ticket so I can be with my sister. Honestly, I am thinking of just packing my essential things and taking them with me and never coming back."
"When you email him, make sure you are forwarding the one you already sent with your second request for information at the top. That way it will have the timestamps of when the emails were sent, and your boss can see how long you've given him to answer you. Otherwise he could claim you sent the emails but didn't give him time to reply before running to the boss."
"This relationship is.. not doing well. He repeatedly lies to you, you don't trust him and keep checking his stuff. It's a bad cycle that keeps happening because he fundamentally doesn't think looking at reddit porn is bad and doesn't think he should have to stop doing it- so he turns you into the bad guy who's forcing him to stop doing something that he enjoys. I don't see this lasting."
"Stop 'hinting', and tell her the truth: you've don't want to be rude or mean, but you just don't have much in common any more and you've outgrown the friendship.

Look at it this way: you hurt her feelings in tiny increments every time you let her down. You hurt her feelings once more, on a larger scale, and then you never have to worry about it again."
"Please don’t take out a payday loan. They specialize in tricks to keep people on the hook for years, even decades. Use a credit card and ask literally anyone you’re close to for help: it’s three minutes of embarrassment rather than years of financial anxiety."
"&gt; it's a family business. 

No. It is a business. And in business, dead weight gets cut."
"Family bonding  and escape work and recharge has a greater return. 

Put the oxygen mask on yourself first."
Threaten to call the cops on him. At that point it’s harassment.
"When our daughter passed away we received lots of cards from people we hadn't heard from in years so I think it's a good idea to send a card with well wishes. We also had people send gift baskets with food, order us takeout, send flowers and weirdly a lot of people sent cash. Not sure why that's a thing. But the answer is definitely send a card, then send whatever else feels right. They may not notice right away but when the fog lifts they'll remember you got in touch and it means a lot."
"Falling in love with someone isn't a prison sentence. So you're in love with her. So what? Delete her number, and think of your mom every time you think of going back to her.

You'll get over her. You will. You just need to give yourself that chance."
Why aren't you paying bills from a joint account? Why does he give you money for a household necessity instead of having that money in a place where you can access it yourself? Is there any record of transactions or is he just handing you cash? This system sounds deeply flawed to begin with and makes me think there's a lot more going on here.
"A bad guy is a bad guy regardless of cultural differences. 

I’d say to assert yourself and express that you will not tolerate that type of behavior, but I don’t think he’d take well to that.

If you feel trapped it’s probably best to leave now while you can, before anything progresses more or you do get actually trapped(financially/emotionally etc)"
"hi! i’m (mexican 19f) in a similar situation. i’m going on a vacation that was paid for by my (white 19m) boyfriend’s family. i work a minimum wage part-time job and it would probably be around three weeks of work just for me to pay for a plane ticket. i offered, but they declined and told me they wanted me to come. 

i wanted to; i love my boyfriend and his family and agreed to their very generous offer. you should go. if they’re offering, then it isn’t a burden. they like you and they like that you make their daughter happy. i hope you go and have a great time!"
"&gt;I know he's not abusive

I wouldn't be so sure."
"&gt;&gt; From what she said, there wasn't any sort of forced anything, but the dude was rough around the edges and it made her feel unsettled and ruined the experience for her.

This is a relatively common life experience -- bad sex.

&gt;&gt;So, this is the sort of things parents should now about so they can further discuss things with their children and help them learn

She turned to *you*, which is equally as responsible.

&gt;&gt;I don't want any drama later if they do know somehow and then I look bad for not saying anything.

You want to disclose a sexual experience your sis told you in confidence on the off chance that you could look bad at some point. C'mon, OP.

&gt;&gt; I am really uncomfortable carrying this secret.

It's only a secret if you think that parents have the unlimited right to know about their kids' unsatisfactory sexual experiences."
"You aren't in love after only 5 weeks. 

I have been desperately in love with my fiance for 4 years now... And even with real true love... If he acted this way about my friends and the people I trust and care for... We would be done. 

Get over her. She is so not worth it"
"I had a boyfriend break up with me at work. In a note. He stuck under my windshield. With a rose. It was so many confusing emotions while my coworkers watched me retrieve the “sweet” rose and note with a smile, only to 😶."
"If someone was still experiencing the deaths of grandparents or their favorite pet as an active enough trauma to spend the anniversary of that death ""sobbing and anxious and physically ill"" eighteen years after the event, yes, I would expect them to be doing active work to improve their PTSD. I would even think that if the event was much more traumatic than those losses usually are for people, which I would imagine your accident was. It's understandable that this event was traumatic, but it's not normal or sustainable for it to continue to affect you this acutely for *over half your life*. There are treatments available and it's reasonable for your boyfriend to ask you to pursue them more aggressively."
"He didn't want to go because he had to get up early for work, but he wanted to finish a conversation late at night when you got back? That makes no sense."
"Even if my friend was rich af I wouldn't tell them to not worry about the cost of something I'm selling them. ""Don't worry about it"" was for me, until the moment I read this story and began reevaluating my entire life, a universal term for ""I got you"". I say that to people when I'm getting the tab at lunch. Maybe I should ask them for $300 in the parking lot afterwards? Who knows now? This lady is collapsing our society."
"I feel like you shouldn’t be okay with it either. Constant plan changing is disrespectful and doesn’t take anyone else into consideration. An occasional change or cancel is one this, but to do it constantly really isn’t fair."
"Sit him down at a neutral time (as soon as possible to head off him initiating sex again) as soon as your kid is down for the night. Tell him there is something really important you need to talk to him about.

It's going to hurt his feelings. There is no way around that. You have to accept this and go in knowing that will  happen.

Tell him you love him and x, y, and z about him (what a good dad he is, funny, whatever). However, you are no longer physically attracted to him due to him gaining so much weight and letting his body go. Let him know that when he said he had no one to impress it really hurt you, because aren't you someone he should want to impress? You want him to care about being attractive for you. 

Explain that you wanted to be a good wife and keep him happy so you've been having sex with him anyway, despite not being attracted anymore, but that has been getting harder and harder for you emotionally and you are just not capable of doing it anymore. You thought you would be able to do keep doing it because you loved him but you just can't. 

Be very clear with him you aren't going to be having sex with again unless he makes serious changes to his body/health. You wish you could be okay with that, you've really tried, but you can't continue. (Then you have to stick to this. If you just have sex with him anyway, nothing will change and you will feel worse and worse. Then you will have hurt him for nothing.)

Hear out his feelings. Let him be hurt or angry. Maybe give him time to cool off or process. Say when he is ready you'd like to talk about where you two can go from here. 

Then talk to him about where you two can go from here. Divorce may not be the only option. For example, if you are okay staying married without sex (if it's not important to you) that is something you can offer. But if sex is important to him and something he wants, then he is either going to need to make the changes to be healthy so you'll want sex again or you guys will have to get a divorce and then he'll have to make someone else want him. (Which he may be able to do overweight.) 

You can be honest with him about how sad, hopeless, guilty, used, whatever this situation makes you feel."
"Calmly ask her to explain her actual reason instead of these excuses to avoid doing so? I mean like, spoilers: she likes you having pubes, but you gotta get her to say that."
"If one roommate is renewing the lease and another is not, a lot of landlords just give the one leaving their full security deposit back, especially if the lease specifically says how much each person pays. When you speak to your landlord about moving out, ask for your portion of the security deposit to go to you directly."
"You need to break up with him safely. No one has mentioned this.
You need to either do it by letter or email or with another person with you in a open space.
You need to be VERY clear that it has ended and you would like the respect and privacy to work through it.

You need to be very clear that he is not to contact you.

You’re dating a massive red flag.
All his behaviour is not healthy. ALL OF IT is unhealthy.
He’s trying to have you be solely reliant on him rendering you completely at his will.

How behaviour is manipulative. Of course he cares for you but it is in a very bad way.
You’ve been through hell and back and you’ve made it this far- you can do this. You have to leave."
"That is exactly my issue. 

I am piggy in the middle here. I don't want to look like an entitled person who is bitter especially with how they are now presenting themselves, or as the evil aunt who is so heartless that she won't spare her family a few hours for a birthday party. 

I had resigned myself to how things were. But with their new stories, it infuriates me. It makes me look like a monster."
"""Sure, dude, take it out of the $5,000 you owe me for rent/food etc while you stayed with me for three months.  Still waiting on some of that!  Thanks :D  """
"This is not fixable. He made it very clear that he was breaking up with you and he did it in an unforgivable, bridge-burning, asshole way.  Your best response is to block him on everything and continue to focus on getting your Masters.  Move on with your life and leave him in the dust."
Has he point-blank told you that he never wants to leave your current town? What does he say when confronted with his long-ago promise to make moving to the city a priority?
Albert is *not* your friend
"You need to give yourself permission to talk about this with your therapist. I guarantee that your therapist has heard worse than just a little jealousy over somebody who 'appears' to have everything you lack (and I say appears because I guarantee she has struggles you know nothing about).

This isn't about your SIL. Because nobody is really treating you two differently. This is how you feel about yourself and your own lack of self-worth. And you need to sort through these feelings in therapy.

There will always be someone out there skinnier than you, smarter than you, more attractive than you, more successful than you, funnier than you, etc. Life isn't a competition. You're letting your competitive nature steal joy from your true life.

You have value just as you are. There's no need to tear her down to lift yourself up. That doesn't lift you up anyhow, it just makes you petty and ugly.

Talk to your therapist. You can work through this. It is a normal and very human failing that you can absolutely conquer!"
"&gt; He doesn’t want to change his diet or workout because “he’s married and has no one to impress”

A disgusting attitude, so not surprising you're disgusted by him.

We love our partners mind, **body**, and soul.  If he's letting himself go at such a young age then it's not your fault you're no longer attracted to him physically."
"&gt; My wife doesn't know I dated my ex

You idiot.

Tell your wife everything."
"Start calling women’s shelters and other organizations for domestic abuse. This is why they exist. They will help you find a way out of this situation.

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT have a child with this man."
"No, you didn't fuck up, but this FWB situation or whatever is probably over. He expected you to read his mind about his relationship expectations.

I don't think it would hurt to overcommunicate in the future about your expectations and all, but I don't think you did anything wrong here. You two weren't on the same page, period."
"Your husband needs to think about you before making a unilateral decision like this. Sorry OP it's straight up bullshit that he's acting like a child and, it seems to me, is one of those ""newer, faster, better"" type of people. He knew you'd be upset but, probably had that ""better to ask for forgiveness later, than permission now"" attitude. Your hubby needs to grow the fuck up."
"Thank you - that feels validating. I know it's not normal, and it just feels odd knowing that he did this without any communication. I feel like, do I educate him, call him out, or call it off?"
But... The camping party was for another friend's gf... Obviously at least one SO was going because it was a party for her...
No kidding?! When I read that I was like uh huh okay and so then you grabbed the cables and... it’s OP’s switch. Bring it home and the 100$ he paid allows him to play with it whenever he wants when he’s over. End of discussion.
"You’re not a sex addict, if that helps you. I left my ex boyfriend after 6 years  the past year and he had the same problem of your bf (additionally, he would last like 2 minutes on the rare occasion and was willing to do nothing about that). You are 28 and deserve to find someone who can make you “fully” happy, possibly for life. 2 years in it’s not that much of investment to suffer lack of intimacy for the rest of your life."
"When you do this, and people ask about your youth and your parents, only talk about facts, things that have actually happened. Don't give an opinion about how you think of them. Like: I hate them, they are horrible, etc. This is definitely not easy, but in the long run it's better. Let other people form their own opinion, their own conclusion. This takes time, and it will take even longer before they let you know. To friends or a partner that you really trust, you can say whatever you want, but not to anyone public. 

If you talk trash about them, it will feed your parents, even if it's opposite of what they do now. It is the energy they need. Don't give it to them. 

And sometimes you let go, you do this even though you know you should not. No problem, if you notice that, stop and start over and forgive yourself."
"Nothing you do is gonna be enough. You're just gonna have to let her have her feels, and do as much as you can to prevent yourself from taking on her burdens. Label insults for what they are and tell her to stop with the name-calling, but ignore the rest of her temper tantrum. 

Survive the next few days, and as you move out set some set some firm, predicable moments for next contact: ""Let's have dinner on Friday/I will call you when I get off work on Tuesday."" 

There is no cure for this. The fight is what she wants so she will keep trying to initiate fights. You can't control that part. Rise above it as much as you can and hope that it fades away when it no longer generates a response from you."
"OP says he managed to save some money, buying them drinks one evening could be a nice gesture as well."
"""I know he's not abusive and apparently he likes annoying and teasing girls he's with...""

No, he **is** abusive. He injures you intentionally and repeatedly and refuses to stop. And he's not teasing, he's relishing his power and control.

Just because an abuser laughs while they abuse you doesn't mean they aren't an abuser."
"You can stop allowing her to make you feel as if *you* are responsible for *her* feelings.  You're not.  You are responsible for living *your* life, not hers.

Go to medical school."
"You should work on that. You are young and you can still have a great life. Don't grow old without addressing those issues because they will affect your friendships, career, and interpersonal relationships for the worse.  That is no way to live. Good luck to you."
"I don't think this counselor is biased. From the way this is written out, it looks like she's being reasonable and you're being defensive. For example, you both have a complaint - her complaint is that you don't talk enough, so she's filling in silences and accidentally putting her foot in her mouth. Your complaint is that she's putting her foot in her mouth. You are very quick to say she needs to change the way she speaks, but you don't need to change yours. I'm sure, to you, it's because hers is the ""problem"" and yours is just ""who you are"". But that's not the case in reality - they're both problems, and both ways to help solve the issue, but you've decided it's all on her rather than on the two of you as a couple.

If you want her to be open to changing herself to suit what you want, you have to open to changing yourself to suit what she wants. You can't be defensive, you have to be collaborative. I bet, if you stopped thinking of this as a confrontation and started thinking about it as ""my wife, who loves me, has this problem and I can help fix it"" and act accordingly, she would also be more open to working on herself on her end to fix it. At bare minimum the counselor would be encouraging her to.

And for the record, point 2 is the only really ""bad"" one here. Two of the others are just her putting her foot in her mouth (which everyone does from time to time, some more than others depending on their social skills), and the last one is just you being less confrontational than her. It's not inherently rude at all."
"This, OP! Wow. This said it all!! You're doing it all right. This family appreciates who you are."
"No one needs to be educated about having sex with someone passed out. There has been so much in the news about consensual sex vs rape. He knows damn well it was wrong, otherwise he would have asked you the morning if you were awake. He thinks he got away with it."
"&gt;So if he could never have one I shouldn’t either.

I cannot even imagine treating someone I love like this."
"Wrong to not tell anyone else? No.

Your husband? Absolutely wrong. Something could happen to your fetus but that's something he should be aware of and has every right to know. Half of it comes from him and y'all have been together so long. There is zero reason to keep this from him."
"No matter what, your husband isn't ready to be a father. Do not get pregnant until he improves or you leave. Let me repeat. A baby will not improve his habits. Please don't bank on that. You will just have more work."
"Very much this. And when it didn't work, late night tantrum."
"Fuck, normal people don't do this to their FRIENDS!"
"I think you should go back, if for no other reason than to accompany your grandmother.   She's carrying this alone and your presence during the visits is a comfort to her.   Also, you'll probably regret it if you bail now."
This is some teenager logic. I’m floored that your boyfriend still thinks it’s okay to operate like this.
"That's weirdly passive. How does the argument at the time go, and why isn't it simply ""what the fuck, I want to drive, stop forcing me out of the seat/forcing the keys out of my hand!"" That's **a really weird thing for him to do.** Not just a quirk, I mean really fucking weird, and it blows my mind that you've just let this go for 4 years without addressing it firmly and permanently."
"It makes things ""real"" and personal all of a sudden, which is usually an extremely gradual shift. I'd say stick it out, you liked him before. Something else might happen that'll bring the feelings back. it's just probably a weird shift in the way you saw him, but he had to become a whole person eventually."
I get the rule man but I feel like it's more for spam. This is an acceptable link IMO. *This might seem aggressive but I'm just saying my peace. Not trying to start something have mercy on me karma gods*
"its not rude to send cash. my child died and people sent/gave me cash and i was unable to function/work. the money gave me a breathing space, besides paying for my son’s services, and i remain very very grateful for that help. (i work but basically live hand-to-mouth).
im sorry for your family’s loss."
"&gt;we should work together in arguments to solve the issue at hand and that recording our arguments feels very ""me vs. you""

&gt;Am I unreasonable or is he?

I mean you don't see the ""me vs. you"" part of that question? Yes recording things is a bit extreme, but call me a cynic, I can't help but think that someone *so* opposed to the idea is at least partly against it because they know or suspect that they wouldn't come out of it well, and they want to escape that level of scrutiny.

Thing is, you say it's inappropriate to suggest it, but **also** say you entirely get his perspective. And yet...you don't get it *enough* to give it a try. So you don't really get his perspective. You say you'd rather ""try to consciously work on being more attentive"". That's **three** arguably weasel words in one sentence: ""try"" ""work"" ""more"". Not ""I will be attentive"".

You can be a team with recorded arguments. Listen to them together, discuss it after the fact. Because recordings are by definition neutral - a simple factual documentation of what was said. But you're taking it as a recording somehow being biased in his favour or against you. Like he'll use your words against you and yet somehow will have no words of his own for you to use against him equally. Which again makes me wonder if you *know* that when you argue you're a bit unfair one way or another and want to avoid a spotlight being shone on that.

I mean even if you didn't like the idea of recordings, if you knew that you were being fair where would be the harm? Because you'd know that they'd backfire on him, you could then say that recordings both make you uncomfortable *and* clearly aren't a good solution to his concerns, then work together on a better way. 

**If nothing else** make a real effort to accept and deal with the underlying issue here, which is that your boyfriend feels unfairly treated by you, unfairly criticised, not listened to, etc. **That's a real problem**. And bluntly, even if you don't like his solution, when he came to you essentially saying ""this situation is so bad I'm considering recording things to resolve it"" your first response was to threaten him with a breakup, not *listen to him.* So that alone to me suggests whatever his faults you've got some serious communication problems yourself that you need to **fix**. Not ""try to work on"".

And to pick up on that phrase - what does ""try to consciously work on being more attentive"" look like to you? I mean it's easy to say ""oh I'll try"", but **how**? Because whatever you've done so far clearly hasn't been enough. What are you going to do differently? ""Try"" is often a bullshit word that basically means ""I'll acknowledge the problem but not really change anything and hope it goes away"".

Rather than focusing on the recording being alarming, you should instead be worried that things between you have got so bad that *this* is what he's left with as an option. If you're going to make the ""two people who love each other"" argument, you've got to also acknowledge that two people who love each other shouldn't be having communication issues so extreme that one of them thinks the only solution is to record arguments. But at least he's trying to think of a solution! What are *you* bringing to the table?"
"Dad sure knows how to pick ‘em, huh?"
"He's going on solo trips while you care for the kids, but doesn't save to treat you to a trip or a spa day, a babysitter, etc. He's being incredibly selfish, especially to go on trips while money is tight.

Why did you have to cancel your trips, but he is going on his? If money is tight, money is tight. It's not tight for you, but loose enough for him to travel. 

It's not his fault you couldn't go on the other trips. It is ENTIRELY his fault that he's going on yet another trip instead of using that money on you or your shared debts, and that kind of selfish bullshit contributes to not having money for your trips."
"&gt; my husband said that I needed to put up boundaries with my friend and I shouldn’t let him touch me like that. I told him he can’t control me like that

Are you serious? He's not controlling you, he's asking you to set boundaries with a ""friend"" who wants to get in your pants. Frankly, you shouldn't even be friends with this person anymore. Not just because it's disrespectful to your marriage to maintain a friendship with someone who tried to interfere in it, but because he called you horrible names and blew up on you when you rejected him. Why are you even still associating with this person? He's not your friend, as evidenced by how he reacted when you talked to him about being less touchy.

I think it's weird as hell for a 45-year-old to go after a 20-year-old personally and I wonder how healthy your overall relationship is, but in this instance your husband is absolutely right."
"&gt; He has a crush on her 

This would be a no from me, dawg. Men and women can be platonic friends but he wants more and that's inappropriate. She is essentially treating him like a stand-in boyfriend when you're not around, either because she's keeping him on the backburner or because she likes his attention. It's disrespectful to both you and him.

If she wants to keep around someone who is holding a torch for her, she needs to either be single or date him. I don't know anyone who would be okay with this."
"Only commenting because the others so far have been pretty negative.

My boyfriend is a logical, pragmatic code monkey to a fault. I am an extremely empathetic writer who gets overwhelmed by others and emotions a lot. The core of the issue isn't your differences, it's finding communication and love in them.

Sure, for some people it's an incompatibility. But in our case, other emotional people tend to drain me after awhile, and other pragmatic people can bore him. He chooses to see my emotional side as exciting passion and creativity and kindness, not flighty and out of control (though it definitely can be). And I see his logic as a grounding force in my life, and a solid guidestone that I can always rely on. Even though, similarly, I could see him as rigid or controlling or less loving (which, to be fair, he can be).

If the person's worth it, try to work together to shift your own perspectives. See how his planning is thoughtful, not clinical. Ask him to think of your tears of joy as expression and love, not overdramatic. 

One thing other people have right, this kind of temperament is important to who a person is. Don't ask anyone to try to change. But maybe looking at each other differently can help.

But if you can't, that's also okay and just means you guys are probably better off with other people of other temperaments. 

Best of luck :)"
"&gt; He didn’t even show up for court.

Impressive level of denial."
"Honestly, it sounds like he already has slept with another man. I would be surprised if he has not. I do not buy at all that he bought by accident. And even if he bought it because he was planning to have sex in the future, and hasn't yet, that kind of leaves your opinions on him doing that out of the picture, doesn't it?

&gt;he told me he had planned to ask me if he could explore his interest in men whilst on his hiking trip, that he’s meant to tell me but the time never came up.

Honestly, combined with the PrEP, the grindr use, and the above, he has probably already cheated. At the very least he has been actively planning to, facilitating it, and is only asking ""permission"" now. If he has cheated, then he probably feels that you giving him permission to sleep with a man now will retroactively make any previous incidents less bad.

I mean come on. Who is he going to randomly meet on a solo camping trip? Someone he already planned to meet beforehand, that is who."
"&gt; Edit: The SIL here is my brother's wife.

You need to move this to the top. People won't read the whole thing if all they see is WTF and incest first."
"Get an abortion and become single. This is a guy who wants to keep you around, so don't bet on adoption, as he will have to give his permission for that. Tell him afterwards you had a miscarriage.

If you have a child with him, that child will be a weapon, just like sex became one to trap you. You might not make much money now, but you'll be out more if you have to do parenthood alone with him stirring shit from the side. He can pay his own bills, you need that money to get out."
"Yeah, I'm not happy with anyone regarding the suject, I'll talk with her after everyone has played there part, Then make my decision after that."
"It can be tough to recognize sometimes because not all abusers are abusive in the same way. But a guy who keeps hurting and scaring you, *knowing* that he's hurting and scaring you, is definitely abusive."
Your husband being sketchy is your problem. The friend is just a symptom of that problem.
"Even if you WERE wrong, this behavior isn't okay."
"The point is that the $100 has made him feel part ownership, and if he's going to act that way she needs to separate his part ownership entirely, or else he just isn't going to 'get it'."
"Dude im on your moms side. Don't pursue this and just ignore/tell her what she did is unforgiveable. Remove this toxic person from your life please, I've seen this before. Shes shopping around, found out the ex isn't what she wanted and now wants you until something better comes along. You will be hurt countless times by her again if you let this go on and i worry you will ignore my advice and mearly look back at this comment later and nod your head in agreement. If you do, thats life."
"This. Hard to believe, but the other woman is even more of a victim than OP (she’s engaged ffs!) OP should tell the poor woman, grab some popcorn, and watch this POS crash and burn.

Reminds me of this guy I know. If rumors are true, he slept with other girls, while dating this girl. Even worse, he was texting women while on his freaking honeymoon!!! Not sure how much of that is true, but damn....."
"&gt;he needs the switch because how can he ask for his PS4 back when he is going through that?” I just feel frustrated because I don’t know how to argue back

You don't NEED it, you just want it.  And since you've had it WAY more than I have, even though I paid for most of it, I'm taking it home now."
"Wow.  This chick has more issues than the National Geographic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure the co-worker she was talking to thought it was messed up too  Just keep your distance in the future with this person. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't feel weird, in that interaction SHE was the one who looked bizarre and dumb, not you. 

&amp;#x200B;

For sure, I'd advise not to disclose too much personal info with co-workers, not that I think you did this time."
"Also, keep in mind that nothing happens in a vacuum.  On top of the previous poster talking about how you can honestly and confidently state that you do not know these people, other people also know these people, and if these people were willing to treat you like this, they likely have treated others the same way.  It sounds like the sources that are informing you of their actions seem to be skeptical of them - not you.  Just keep on keeping on.  Ignore it.  Everyone else knows what really happened, and you can get on with your life - as you always have."
""" Am I over reacting for want to decide I don't want to be with her anymore?  ""

NO.  Break up with her immediately, if you haven't already.  Her friend Lexy assaulted you and I would go to the police about that as well.  Your girlfriend is sick for joking around and humiliating you."
"I think the key to putting yourself out there. You would probably be amazed by how many people feel the same. I know I did, and do still. 

In our late 20s and 30s we easily become disconnected with our friends because of a number of factors - people enter serious relationships, have children, focus on their career, move away. 

What's important is doing your bit to maintain the friendships you do have. Some will still fall by the wayside, that's just life. To make up for those, join social clubs, sporting teams, reach out to new people in your life and ask them to hang out. It can be a little daunting, but you will probably be glad you did. 

I'm in my early 30s now and almost all my close friends live in different states or countries. We stay in contact, but it's definitely not the same as them living down the road. I have made a few new friends in the last few years, but I definitely had to work on it, it doesn't just happen like when you're younger. 

Good luck!"
If you were in her position would you want to know?
"&gt;I’ve tried, and he gets all silent when I try to leave with it. It’s like a child and i’m speechless, he always complains how he’ll have “nothing to do now” and basically makes me feel guilty for taking something that’s mine.

the fuck? So let him be silent. Go home with your switch."
"I have pictures of him and i KISSING on my facebook (as public), screenshot of his WhatsApp contact with him having a picture of us as a profile, i guess, i have how to prove my relationship with him..."
"Better yet, “I’m taking *my* switch home”"
"&gt; Part of me wants to remind him he never liked his mother in the first place and rarely saw her. 

That would be a dumb idea. She was still his mom, and her death might be difficult precisely because she was never the mom he hoped for. Now there is also never a chance of that happening. He might have regrets bout how he handled things. He might just be mourning the idea of ever having a nice mom.

That being said, him taking his grief out on you is not acceptable. It seems like he's bottling everything up and then acting out like a teenager. Grief counseling would be a good idea."
"If you can't talk to your partner about sex, you shouldn't be having sex. Why not talk to her about your expectations when it comes to physical intimacy?"
"Who cares what you might look like to this woman? She’s a stranger, briefly contacting her is unlikely to have further repercussions for you even if they aren’t still together."
"&gt;We don't communicate about our feelings enough in general.

Both of you have to WANT to actively work on that if you want your marriage to survive. Start the discussion."
"\&gt; We have just grown into 2 completely incompatible people.  

Sounds like you have your answer."
"I've seen people put ""THIRD REQUEST"" in the title of emails before. Will definitely catch everyone's attention."
I don't understand why you think they should know. Do you talk to them about all *your* sexual experiences?
Oof. That's really gross and disrespectful. Do your son still lives with you?
"What you're talking about are basic levels of cleanliness. Taking the trash out isn't something that can be ignored because it doesn't happen to bother you- it's something that literally HAS to get done so that you don't end up with bugs and horrible smells. Same with doing the dishes. Eventually you won't have any clean dishes to use, and you'll have fruit flies and mold. Those are things that need to get done in a household and part of being an adult is saying ""even though I feel like being lazy and watching Stranger Things right now, I know I need to take the trash out, so let me pause this for a minute and complete this extremely simple chore"". Your bf has no sense of responsibility, partially because he knows that if he doesn't do these chores, you'll eventually give in and do them for him. 

It's not being controlling to ask that your partner contribute to basic household cleanliness, especially when you're the one doing 100% of the shopping, cooking and rest of the cleaning. The solution is that he needs to learn to grow up and do his share, or you dump him."
"&gt; no matter where we live, where we go, my husband finds the guy who does coke.

Yeah Bob is not your main problem here."
"At this point he should be able to at least get engaged to you and willing to live together. If he is still somehow on fence about that after two years and already being 40, then he never will be.

&amp;#x200B;

About freezing the eggs, I think that would be better. If you just do embryos, then there is a chance all your kids can only be his. The harsh fact is that divorces and break ups happen. If that were to happen to you, you might want to get remarried, then it would be rather uncomfortable situation to be able to just have ex-husbands kids. I´m sure all break up things sounds impossible now, but you never know what can happen."
"Ohhh yeah he totally planned this and is going to use his anger to try to guilt her. Ugh, this makes me sick. 

OP, get that abortion and leave him asap. Don't look back!!!"
The key thing here is that he gets angry enough to frighten her and he is also possessive. That's the biggest problem.
"Definitely an overwhelming response of run for my life. The motion has been put into play, she’s blocked and can’t contact me. I can’t believe I was putting up with it in the first place, y’all have really helped me out."
"I think it's safe to say he's shown his true colours, OP. If my husband reacted this way over a situation such as this, I would leave him. My perception of him would be ruined and I'd never see him the same way again."
"You're a professional photographer, so, as you'll know if you've read any /r/ChoosingBeggars, the most direct way to extricate yourself from this is to charge them money for providing the service you provide others for money. Family should *want* your business to succeed and therefore should be willing to pay you, in which case you're just doing a job and it happens to be for him. If they refuse now that it's not free, then you've gotten yourself out of the dilemma!"
"&gt;he's truly an amazing person and i don't know if i can find another one like him.


Really? This guy who called you, “crazy,” is an “amazing person?”


It’s easy to get along when the getting along is easy, it’s how you get along when the hard stuff happens that’s the true test. This guy failed the test. 


Would an “amazing” person say that to someone? Would an “amazing” person say it over a text?


Take some time to rethink your standards. I think you’ve set them too low if this person is amazing."
"“Boyfriend, I’m sorry that you don’t feel like you can ask for your PS4 back right now, but that really has nothing to do with the arrangement you &amp; I made for how to share the Switch. Since we aren’t able to keep to the schedule for the Switch, I think the best thing to do is for me to give you back the $100 you paid toward it &amp; to stop sharing it.” 

Also, color me unsurprised that the same person that can’t follow a schedule to share a Switch also loaned out his only gaming system to a friend that isn’t returning it. It sounds like he has bad boundaries all around when it comes to sharing &amp; other people’s possessions. This may seem like a really small thing now, but it’ll be much more important when everything you own is “ours” &amp; he is loaning our stuff like your shared living room TV or your shared car."
"I think this is a wonderful idea. I've heard accounts of people being incredibly overwhelmed by condolences during a time of loss especially with social media. 

If the family isn't well off I would try to do something that will help with day-to-day worries, namely money. When my brother-in-law died suddenly, my mother-in-law got a bit of cash from friends and family which was a great help. It seems crass to give someone money in that situation but it helped a lot more than all the flowers we had to haul home that died a few days later."
"&gt; My wife doesn't know I dated my ex

WTH? This is a huge breech of trust. This should have been revealed in the EARLY STAGES OF DATING. Tell your wife IMMEDIATELY.

&gt; Now she is sending me my nudes which I sent her when I was dating her and is threatening me to upload my nudes and spread it all over the internet. Moreover, my wife doesn't know I dated her and she will be very upset. I am very much in agony on what to do...

Take your phone and take it to the police. This is revenge porn and illegal in many places."
"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...WTF.  Does your husband talk as the mice and with the mice when at his parents?  This is VERY odd and quite dysfunctional if they aren't able to communicate with each other as a family, as simply themselves."
"It's not really comparable. It's one thing to choose to ignore rude and tacky behaviour in favour of not burning a bridge you might need to walk later, but it's a VERY different kettle of fish to blatantly ignore and even cover up actual and heinous cases of sexual assault and harassment."
"Just send her texts and pictures, she won't believe your words alone."
"&gt;he like sulks so I just end up dropping it and letting him have his way because I start to feel bad.

And whether intentional or not, he gets his way by manipulating you. You have to stand up for yourself - your feelings matter as much as his! You let him get his way because he feels bad, but notice that when *you* feel bad and get annoyed at him...he doesn't give a shit, he just pouts. That's not how an adult reacts, and that's not remotely fair in a relationship."
"&gt; He just has this weird thing where he feels like he's always the guy bringing his gf to stuff with his friends (when it was appropriate of course). But this is purely because he was the only with a girlfriend in his group of friends 

The last time I encountered this kind of situation, all the people involved were under the age of 21. Your boyfriend is THIRTY. It's really weird that he's still in an attitude of ""friends time is separate to girlfriend time, and mixing the two is awkward"" when most people shake that attitude off shortly after leaving high school."
"I sorr of resonate with this but I’m not married. A few months ago my friend’s GF introduced us to her friend, who was this really pretty girl who I already felt threatened by the first time I met her because she was really cute and my boyfriend’s type(or at least his type before me). I noticed he would try to talk to her everytime my friend’s GF would video call her, and we played a game together and all had to make usernames and he made his username named after hers. (his username was “-insert her username- slayer”) I also had found out he added her on FB and followed her on IG as well before any one of us in the friend group did. I felt super uncomfortable for a while until one night I was talking to my friend’s GF and even she had noticed my BF was taking an interest in her. I couldn’t take it anymore and became up front with him.

He had told me he was trying to just socialize and he didn’t mean any harm. And he said him making his username after hers was him trying to be funny. I told him it made me uncomfortable and I didn’t like it, so he completely stopped after that and now our relationship is honestly way better. Before we didn’t really communicate our feelings well but now we are more comfortable in being forward with our feelings and if we’re doing something that is bothering one another.

If your husband really loves you, he would try to rethink his behavior and reverse it. All you have to do is say it. When I said it, I started with “do you like -insert friend’s GF’s friend’s name?” I didn’t sugarcoat anything and honestly that’s what you’re going to have to do."
"I’ve been where you’re at. I was so angry at him for wasting my time. Over 3 years (not as long as you, but still long). 

My advice is, if comforting him sets you back, don’t do it. It’s his problem. Yes, I understand sexuality is complex, but dragging someone else into it is a cruel thing to do. No one just wakes up randomly gay. 

If you feel angry, be angry. It’s justified. If you feel hurt, be hurt. Don’t be his crutch, work on you. If he asks for friendship, but you’ll find it hard to think of him with others, don’t accept it. 

You’ll be fine in the end though, you’ll look back on this and not feel much about it. People love and have their hearts broken all the time, but everything mends. 

And if you can, head on over to you bestfriend’s house for pizza, ice cream, and some hugs haha. My bestfriend hugged me the whole night, especially when I broke out in tears over and over again. Best thing she’s ever done for me."
"Your parents probably don't need to know? Like unless your sister was sexually assaulted and/or thinks she might be pregnant, there's really nothing to be gained from telling them and it will make her very upset"
"&gt; Honestly, I am thinking of just packing my essential things and taking them with me and never coming back. 

This is 100% what you should do.  You said yourself, this wasn't the first time, it was the worst.  It WILL keep getting worse if you stay.  Go be with your sister and her husband and start a new life there."
"If I buy a pair of $80 shoes in the wrong size, I don't get to through a fit about it when I can't wear 'em. He bought an $80 game for a console he doesn't actually own, so he can't play it. 

This isn't his first game system. He knows how these things work."
"I'd say 'you know I said no when you asked if I cheated? Well, I was telling the truth, I haven't. But I do feel I crossed some boundaries with the way I interacted with (co-worker). There was nothing physical but I regret how close we were whilst you and I were fighting'

Don't actually say 'emotional affair'. For some people, especially men, that implies something that it doesn't sound like you did. I think your husband is more concerned with the physical side of things and if you were in love with this guy."
"People have covered a lot of the other issues, but I haven't seen this: you sleep on the couch sometimes so your husband doesn't have to deal with your snoring, but you don't sleep well on the couch. Can your husband sleep there sometimes as well?

Also (and I know others have said it) it's BS that you're the only one who gets up twice a night with your son. You want to talk about fair sleeping schedules? You are more than owed one day a week to sleep in!"
Why make excuses? Just say please don't touch me after a few times he'll stop.
"An excuse that makes zero sense. These idiots should try harder. Why would you be upset at a friend. ""See? I knew you'd be upset"". Yes, because you deliberately hid the girl for months (or a year in OP's case)."
"&gt;Ever since my boyfriend joined a program with his family he’s made at least 25 or more female friends

Is it a cult?"
"You should definitely talk to him about your concerns and how it makes you feel. You can tell him how anxious it makes you. The only thing you shouldnt do is tell him who he can and cannot be friends with.   I know two people who were really good friends, started dating, realized that it wasnt what they thought it would be and they couldnt give each what they needed so they broke up. They couldnt just not be friends after that, it wasnt even a bad break up. They just didnt work romantically. I dont know your, or his, situation but you cant dictate who he wants in his life."
"There was this enormous flashing sign in my head about this post, and you nailed it. 

Insecurity.

When you share a child with someone, you break up and they have children with someone else it breeds a level of insecurity between those two women and the father. It’s only natural that competitiveness comes into play psychologically.

The key is establishing healthy boundaries, and if the father is capable of simply flipping between the two - then neither woman should waste their time.

If you spend your existence being terrified of what your baby daddy is going to do, then you’re not acting as the strong mumma that you’ve been for the past god knows how many years.

It’s a comfortable thing to go back to an ex, but when you think deep inside your own self you realise - I made it this far with my kids, without that guy and I’m going to stop falling for his bullshit and live my own life as a mother and make sure my kids are my priority.

That takes that anxiety away from even worrying about myself and my kids believing that this relationship is going to last.

Be strong for your kids, OP - not the person who is so weak he can’t even make a decision about his life and where he ends up based on a single phone call.

Respect yourself, you’re better than this situation."
If you tell your parents the way this guy treats you and they still love him and try to guilt trip you its time to move. But honestly parents might love him because he seems great when they see him and they're don't know the abusive side of him.
"I'm so sorry to hear about what happened to your sister and her family.

&amp;#x200B;

But you need to figure out what you can to get the fuck away from that guy because he's a monster. Like nothing about the behavior you're describing is that of a kind, caring or considerate person."
"Yeah. Just say, ""I am taking my Switch back. I've had it maybe five days out of the last 8 months, so yeah, it's coming back with me."" Act like it's the most reasonable thing in the world, because it is. ""I haven't gotten to play with my own games or Switch that I bought myself. You paid me $100 to borrow it from time to time and you've more than gotten your money's worth out of me."" Then leave. Don't let him keep taking advantage of you."
"if she told your mom ""don't worry about it"" and then proceeded to ask for *any money at all*, this artist is an asshole."
"&gt; He got all upset accusing me of spying and saying that i didn't know anything that i was assuming the wrong thing and that it wasn't how i thought it was, saying that i was accusing him of stuff that wasn't real

Notice that when he was cornered, his response was immediately to put all the blame on you. ""YOU are spying, YOU are assuming, YOU are accusing me, YOU need to mind your own business.""

That basically just proves his guilt, and that he never had your best interests at heart. If he cared for you, if there was a legitimate reason for his lies, he would have explained them. Not turn the blame on you when HE is the one who's been exposed as untrustworthy. He's the one who looks bad, so rather than explain himself, he's just making you feel bad instead. 

You can inform his partner, but honestly, he's probably already told her a story of you being a crazy stalker, and to not believe any ""falsehoods"" you might tell her. So it's up to you what action you want to take. But either way, dump him out of your life."
"I’ve been with my boyfriend for years. We definitely wake each other up for sex sometimes, but neither of us would EVER have sex with the other while PASSED OUT. Also, just because some couples might do it, doesn’t mean you have to be comfortable with it. I certainly wouldn’t be. You’ve also only been seeing him a few months! I would 100% confront him, let him know that isn’t ok, and call it off."
"This should be said again:

**You aren’t in love after only 5 weeks.**

Slow your roll in future relationships. Way, wayyyyyy down. You barely know this person. 

Oh, and this chick is a strange, controlling, immature red flag parade. Dump her now."
"Have a short, direct conversation with her. ""hey creepy now that my role has changed its imperative that I am unbiased in our relationship.  We won't be able to hang out outside of the confines of work"". Keep it short and professional.  And from now on,be very polite but slightly distant in your interactions with her.

If you really feel she doesn't do her job well - document the heck out of it prior to taking any action.  Be prepared as this is the type of person who will make a false claim of a personal vendetta if her review is subpar."
People on this website are really not qualified to speak to inter-tribal relationships. Everything is going to come at you from an American perspective.
I'd be really questioning a friendship with this person.
"To add to that, if you're trying to WIN your arguments against your partner you'll both lose. Even if you somehow win through logic, your partner is now brooding cause he/she lost, which isn't very productive for your relationship. The only way there's a winner is if both partners win. That's why you're supposed to be having conversations, not arguments, and you come to a conclusion by accepting compromises. A couple that can't manage to do that on a reliable basis is bound to fail eventually in my opinion."
"Of course he drops everything for her and not you, she fucks him. I don't want to bw unkind to you at all, and I'm sorry if I'm overly blunt, but you sound a bit like my mom with my (adult) brother on the friends thing... You probably ""don't want to embarrass him,"" but he doesn't give a shit about whether or not he's embarrassing and disrespecting you, and sometimes you have to embarrass your kids to parent them and to set boundaries in general. Tell his friends/girlfriend to get out of your house because your son has more important shit to do. He's *your kid*. If he's always going out and his school work is suffering, you ground him. If he has friends over and they distract him and keep him up, you ground him. It's your house, your rules. I get that that's not a fun way to parent, but it's what he needs. I say this as a 25 year old myself, someone who never needed this kind of parenting, but some people *just do*. And if he hates it, he can move out and find his own place (he won't, that's hard), and then its firmly Not Your Problem anymore. He will suffer his minor failings, come back to you for a bit, and then leave again wiser. That's a pretty dang good outcome. Everyone as to suffer, stumble, or fall at some point, and its better that suffering be ""my mommy embarrassed me"" than ""I couldn't get into a good college because I was too busy with a MILF who dropped me for a younger piece 3 years later, after I stuck around in my hometown for her and killed my relationship with my family."" Ground your son."
"You've been together for 7 YEARS.

You should not have been uninvited and he was  very wrong to do so.

This wasn't some kind of guys weekend or singles only event. It was an event for friends and their companions.  So what you'd be the only set there? Set some boundaries about PDA and don't worry about it.

You can tell him you're feeling hurt and really don't want to talk about what a great time he had until you can make peace with what happened and how you're feeling.


Is there a history here of him doing things like this?"
"OP you really need to discuss this with your therapist. I can tell how much you dislike this woman simply from your posts - that’s not me judging you but simply recognising it’s really unhealthy and obviously distressing for you (as well as unfair to SIL and your husband). Negative feelings are not shameful, everyone has them, and the only way you can work through this is to be open and honest about them.

I also think you also need to do some work around trauma and, quite honestly, self-pity. You have had an awful experience and you look on your SIL as someone who hasn’t struggled like you have - that may be a fair assessment, but imagine someone who’s been infertile forever looking at your life and saying, ‘Damn, she’s complaining about being in fertile but she’s already got 2 healthy kids. I wish that was my biggest issue!’ You know? You’ve been through an awful experience but I think you need to step back and potentially explore your lack of empathy for others (or why you project this onto SIL specifically) with your therapist."
"Holy shit! Glad you got out! I think in your &amp; OP's situations, this can definitely turn into physical abuse!"
"Best comment on the thread, I really like the last part and I’m going to use it more in my life"
"I think people who have had a tough time growing up need to be so careful with boundaries as adults. I just picked the wrong person to drop mine around (it was a friendship that had gone bad) and she basically tried to use fear, shame and guilt to control me and it got in my head and did damage.

Don't do this to yourself because you are worried how it will look."
"Well, he was pretty clear about where you stand in his priorities. Why would you invest any more time in this relationship?"
"Keep calling it out, but try not to get into lengthy discussions about it especially if you can see it’s not going anywhere. Sometimes calling it out and then walking away is best. Good luck"
"Yup.

Self destructive.

Speaking from personal experience. Don't know what it is but apparently I don't enjoy relationships past a year"
And if for some reason you need help with the abortion I am happy to help. There are so many red flags with this guy.
Cheaters are always extra suspicious.
"Your boyfriend should be shutting her down ans dealing with this.  It is not ok that he is just letting you get hit with her attacks all the time.

Tell him to tell her to stop.  And if she says anything to you, say something like ""why would you ask that?  Thats not an appropriate question"".  Or totally ignore her and chance the topic."
"Just him thinking of him being like ""I got away with it"" pisses me off."
"You can’t help them, and by extension him. But you can help yourself- get away from them, move out. You could still stay close by, so you can visit your brother.

Autism is not “healable”, as Autistic people are wired differently- there is nothing to cure. Until they start to treat it as such, they will be unable to manage it."
"OP said their kid will be 5 soon.  So thats 6 years minimum unless the kid is adopted, and thats with assuming they got pregnant immediately.  If we figure they waited even one year, then thats his mom picking up a 21 year old.  Even if we say his parents were better off splitting up... yeah, thats super predatory."
So... why is staying in this relationship worth it? What are you getting out of it besides anxiety over finances?
"She’s 17, which is nearly an adult. If she wanted her parents to know, she would have told them. I would research potential resources in the area regarding consent but other than that there isn’t much you can do. She trusted you in confidence and if something bad happens to her later, you will regret having ruined that. If she doesn’t feel like she was assaulted, there isn’t much to be done. Unless, of course, she was."
He raped you.  He’s not a good person.
"I agree in this situation but this always makes me uncomfortable. I’ve seen people use this reason to ignore and excuse terrible behaviour that didn’t directly affect them. It bred a legion of little Weinsteins in tech, for one."
"This is just a hypothesis.

It may be that Megan is a chameleon.  She acts one way around you and your friends and a totally different way around others.  So mixing social circles would create an awkward ""worlds colliding"" situation.

I have chameleonic personality traits, so I compartmentalize like this.  Is it weird?  Yes.  But is it malacious?  No."
"because you know what it's like to be and feel hurt and don't want to cause it on others.

so now you want to compensate. except, trust me, people will take and take and take and still make you feel like shit. 

this is not how you establish respect and long term genuine affectionate relationship. this is how you establish you being a human mop.

i know what i am talking about. please don't do the same mistake. get over it by distancing yourself physically and mentally."
"I'm a guy if it matters to your boyfriend and I'm assuming he's going to read this because he's the only reason you had to make this post so here goes:

Your boyfriend is an idiot.

If he'd like me to go in to more detail about why he's an idiot I'd be happy to do so."
"&gt;I know technically he hasn't been unfaithful but I feel really hurt and unloved.

Fidelity is about more than love and sex, it includes maintaining boundaries with people outside the relationship.  Your husband is investing energy in getting closer to your brother's wife.   That's neither normal nor okay. 

You have to bring up up with specific examples of behavior that appear to be a man pursing a crush.   He's probably to deny and deflect but you need to let him know that he isn't behaving like a committed husband."
That's super disgusting. Of course you're allowed to be angry with him.
"You don't have to be friends with your family just because they are family. Friends come and go too, sometimes you just outgrow each other. You sound pretty negative in your post. Are you in therapy? Why do you not have friends? Do you have anything else going on besides being a parent? Maybe a hobby or two? Volunteering? A small job?"
"Yes.  Do this.  I am serious.  Take your important documents, your financial records, those few things that you would realistically run through fire to rescue--some family photos perhaps?--and leave.

**Don't tell him you are leaving for good.**  Make all the gestures, do all the things that you would normally do if you were leaving for any length of time.  Don't take more clothes than you usually would, for example, or more make-up.  *Material goods can be replaced.*  

Your well-being?  **Your well-being is priceless.**  You need to safeguard that at all price.

P.S.  Some financials to take care of before you leave:

* Freeze your credit.

* Open up a new account at a new bank and move what funds you have to that.  I say this because if you have an individual and joint account at the same bank, it isn't necessarily all that hard for your EX-fiance to cajole a teller into giving him access--I bet he's charming, right?  Abusers know how to manipulate people, so you are protecting yourself here.

* Take your name off of any utility bills that you currently handle.  If that means actually committing to stopping service until another name can be put on, that's actually great!  It means that your credit can't be abused.  Tell your ex once your safe, or not.  I wouldn't.

* Don't tie yourself into knots about being noble and ""doing the right thing by your ex.""  Don't pay any bill that doesn't have your name on it, don't hand him any money because ""you don't want him left with nothing.""  He just spat on your dead niece and felt pretty damn proud of himself:  what is it that you feel you owe him, again?"
"As you said she's become an integrated member of your friend group so it's no longer a matter of invited, she's just one of the gang. 

It's possible she's broached inviting you or your mutual friends to her other hang outside to her other friends and they said no or aren't looking to add people to their other group. 

She's entitled to have other friends and doesn't need to share all of her life with you. It kind of sounds like you're fishing for problems about her so you can feel more justified in your jealousy regarding her spending more time with your original friends. 

If you really want to hang with her other friends just say it ""hey friend, it would be really cool to meet some of your other friends, can we/I come along?"" It may bot have even occurred to her that you want this."
"for real though, the red flags are a fucking quilt  that OP should pass down to her family at this point.

&gt;🚩 After some very amateur sleuthing, I found out that he lied to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 He was actually 32 at the time, so not a recent undergrad  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 he also seemed to forget to mention that he was in the middle of a divorce  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩he wants someone with a youthful energy because women his age are “jaded” &lt;**&lt; on a personal note: THIS MISOGYNISTIC FUCK**  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩it became very apparent that he is somewhat damaged and jaded himself  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩was looking for something or someone who bring something meaningful back into his life again. &lt;**&lt; you deserve fulfillment on your own, not just making him whole again.**

# I’ll also take some time to tell you that I admittedly have daddy issues

i'm highlighting this because you've minimized it. talk to someone please, you deserve so much better than this.

&gt;🚩 Throughout the time I’ve known him, even before we started dating, he’s  been kind of clingy.   
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 He also appears to be in competition with his  ex-wife, always looking her up on social media and showing me what’s  she’s up to in disgust, then posting about his “younger, fresher, and  hotter girl” making sure she or someone close to her has a way to see it  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 Additionally, he gets very angry with people interacting with me.  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 he says I’m too young to understand and this is what men do for their women. **&lt;&lt; FUCKING ASSHOLE CONDESCENDING MISOGYNISTIC FUCK**  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩He is very much into gender roles in the sense that he was to protect and provide for me and all that.   
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 He also wants sex a lot. It’s  physically draining for me and I have some not so great past experiences  that I don’t think I’m fully over, but he nags me and asks for it to  the point where it’s just easier to give in and hope for a good time  than to go back and forth. **&lt;&lt; OP i take no pleasure in telling you this, but you're a sex toy to him.**

# 🚩 To be honest, he acts creepy, the way he wants to spite his ex so bad is  kind of cringeworthy and unsettling, he can be on edge for no reason,  he is needy and doesn’t understand that I can’t always be physically  available, and he acts much younger than 33 sometimes.

**please please please, dump this deadbeat.**

&gt;🚩He has provided more consistent financial stability than anyone in my  family has, coming to the rescue when I’ve had sudden visits to the  hospital or bills from my college. **&lt;&lt; he's going to lord this over you as an excuse to control and abuse you in the future.**  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩This is the first relationship I’ve ever been in so I don’t know what’s  normal and what’s not; I’m basing a lot of my thoughts off of what I’ve  been told is normal and healthy to be honest. **&lt;&lt; unfortunately, because of your disability, your options  may be unjustly limited. but none of this is normal.**  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 My aunt, who I live with, really doesn’t like him, and some of my  friends think he’s cute with the gifts and posts but mostly creepy and  too negative. **&lt;&lt; TRUST THEM.**  
&gt;  
&gt;🚩 They’re not fond of the age gap. **&lt;&lt; literally no one would be.**

**i would never, ever, ever treat a woman i was interested in like this. it's manipulative, controlling, and abusive. you deserve so much more.**"
"Yes, you are right to feel violated:  this was rape.

Do not have a stern talk with him or try to ""resolve"" the situation.  There is nothing to ""address"" here:  he raped you.

He will rules lawyer you (look that up), telling you that, ""Well, you didn't SAY that was permitted, so HOW could I possibly KNOW"" + general woe-is-me behavior designed to get you to comfort *him.*

He will promise to never do it again, now that he knows.

He will rape you again.

He will blame *you,* insisting that you're just so damn sexy, he couldn't help himself.

He will probably, given enough time, stop waiting for you to fall asleep and start raping you while you're still awake--it's even more exciting, watching you try to stop to him.

It's not about sex.  Rape is never about sex.  Rape is about *power.*  That's what excites the rapist, the *power* he has over you.

Break up with him over text and block him everywhere.  Call either loveisrespect or thehotline and talk to someone.  Call your women's shelter or DV organisation and see if they have a list of recommended therapists (check to see if they don't have something on their websites.)

Call up Team You.  You need pampering and support.  Brace yourself for the discovery that not Team You might thin out--people like to blame the rape victim, and some of your friends might, too.  

I am so sorry, OP, but you will get through this.

P.S.  Captain Awkward is also a good source for advice on self-care after trauma."
"This is brilliant. I've started answering questions about my parents by talking about my friends instead, because they've actually been there for me."
"EXACTLY!! tbh I didn't even need to read this thing, this is just what you say. Some poeple are touchy, I know I am (a woman) and even I've had people tell me that which is fine."
"If you are well known enough maybe an interview about your experiences in the system, and casually mention how it was made worse by finding the court documents about how your parents did not want you, etc!

They do not deserve to even speak your name nevermind brag about your success!"
"This sounds like Trichotillomania.  It can manifest in different ways including pulling hair out, eating your hair (literally swallowing it- super harmful), picking at your skin, and yes the split ends thing.

Its a compulsion and can be worsened by stress. Its also possible she was hiding it from you before and now feels more comfortable not to. It is manageable and treatable. 

Its a relatively mild disorder and doesn't usually come with other problems, just the physical damage.  The split ends thing is unlikely to cause longterm damage to her hair, which is good this is a comparatively mild case of an already mild disorder.

Its worth lovingly suggesting she see a professional about it. 

Sometimes starting with couples counseling can help. She won't feel like you're saying ""something's wrong with you"", the counselor can help you bring up your concerns, and if you find a couples counselor who has experience with Trich then they can help her.

Its also just a damn good idea for people who are engaged to do couples cou selling! That's a great way to present it to her- that you want to make sure you have a strong marriage so let's start couples counseling.

You can also gift her, if you can afford it, monthly trims at the hair salon to keep split ends at bay.  Be aware this may cause it to manifest in a different way. If that happens then you need to be more firm about her seeking help.

If she refuses to acknowledge it or address it then... Well you've got a rough choice to make, I'm afraid."
"Didn't even need to read any further than **super Christian**.

That's just a political way of saying all the other descriptors you used."
"I completely agree. And tangential, but I also wanted to add it may not have been the best idea to announce your pregnancy at someone else's party. I think this holds true for anyone, but especially someone who can't have a baby. 

I know you weren't able to this time, but a headsup for next time."
yeah i got on top once early on and he was like “wow you finally worked as hard as me for once.” which i found frustrating bc when i met him i was recovering from oral surgery and i still went down on him. the man always gets foreplay and i get nothing.
"The quicker you get an abortion, the cheaper and easier it’ll be. Tell your parents, get a loan if you need to. Don’t tell him."
"Ofc i would, I'm just too scared to do it
I'm under a lot of stress because of family and honestly don't want to have someone being a jerk to me..

And what if they are not together anymore? He just avoids the topic and i do too

I mean he would've still lied about it...
But if i do and I'm wrong, would i just be a meddler or gossipmonger? (Sorry english isn't my first language, don't really know what words to use)"
Maybe you can transfer to a different location same chain.
"Do not continue to see this girl. She's insecure, jealous, and quite frankly sounds like an utter douchebag. She's trying to isolate you from your friends, treats you rudely, and dismisses people you care about. You're looking at a red sea of what should be dealbreakers OP."
"you should tell her.

other than that - end it. throw the whole boyfriend away. you can easily get another one."
"My dad one time recorded my mom during an argument and tried to show her so she would understand how she acted/how little she actually remembered about what was said. 

She smashed the recorder when he showed her. 

I think it does sound weird to do this, but growing up with a mother who literally makes shit up after arguments to the point I think she has serious mental health problems... I don't totally disagree with the idea. I mean... she would start screaming and yelling then by the end of the fight it was you who started it and she would make up so much shit I don't even understand. Thinking about it even now is making me feel near violently angry. 

Are you sure you don't do something like this?"
"I don't feel I've ever been the kind of person that easily takes issues with things and tries to stir up the pot but this has been bothering me for so long. We don't communicate about our feelings enough in general. I don't think he will take it very well but as long as I'm able to keep calm and, like you say, not point fingers but just start a conversation about how I feel at least it will open the lines of communication."
"He was the king of denial, and I was the queen. I stayed for 30 years with his serial cheating ass. I gave up that thrown, he’s still stubbornly holding on to his. 6.5 years later he claims he doesn’t understand why I left him.  Perhaps if he didn’t tear up the divorce papers served on him he’d have a clue. Lol"
"OP, I think you need to leave this woman. Not only are you two incompatible in general, she is proving herself to make horrible choices that leave you not being able to trust her as a partner. Move on."
Update: Called her and talked about it. She wondered why I did it but said it was fine and that she had a hunch. So overall everything seems fine and I guess we're dating now. I'm not going to do that again.
Thank you for this.
"I have to wonder how long ago this was. You say “many years”. Did she hook up with a 19 year old? Or a 25 year old? If you were both still in your teens when this happened I’d caution against meeting her because that’s really predatory and gross for a 40 year old. If this dude was mid twenties when he met and married your mom it’s a different story, a 25 year old is typically in their career and a mature adult."
"Hmmm my ex used to start difficult conversations before I was going out, never realised this before. It never stopped me but it made me feel like I couldn’t enjoy myself as much"
"This is really kind of you to offer, but I just want to direct you to check their post history. you can make your decisions from there."
"&gt;Locking me out of my home is what my dad does, not my SO. 

That's also not appropriate parenting behavior, just so we're clear."
"The fact that it's the simple truth helps too, push comes to shove, she has the actual history and paperwork/documents to back up her story and they're made to look like the lying gloryhounds they are."
"I was nineteen a few months ago, and I’ve been sexually active (so in a position to get pregnant) for the past few months. Speaking as someone who would also never want a baby at this age and can imagine your terror: 

1- cut off contact with this person. Go stay with someone you trust, and don’t tell him where. 

2- get everything in order for an abortion as soon as you possibly can. No, you aren’t a murderer for not allowing a cluster of cells to develop into the child of a man who’s abusing you, a child you don’t want and can’t have, a child you will have an unbelievable amount of responsibility for. 

Go to Planned Parenthood and get the abortion. Don’t get trapped into having a child you don’t want that will tie you forever to an abuser."
"Weddings and bachelor parties are not mandatory attendance events. Guess what? A lot of people can’t go to weddings or bachelor parties because they can’t afford to. 
  So how is someone else’s wedding more important than his wife’s mental health? Being with kids all day, everyday...sucks. It’s draining. I would personally rather go to work then be with children all day. YOU NEED A BREAK. 

He is being selfish."
"Listen, I usually get annoyed that people on here are so quick to say “he’s cheating, dump him” but I actually think this case merits it.

It is SUPER shady that he is speaking to a 20 year old in secret about his rocky relationship with you. He sounds like a complete sleazebag."
"When you're with someone for 7 years, you qualify as a close friend. Just want you to know that."
"I feel like sending cash (well, a check) would be to cover the medial or burial expenses and the time off work.  I guess it’s horrible to write that out, but my instinct is to send money.  I just don’t know if that seems rude, like it did to you I guess?

Cousin has a decent job, but they were always tight on money and his wife stays at home."
"You guys clearly weren't sexually compatible and its best you ended it but there doesn't have to be something wrong with him for him to not want sex more than twice a month, just as there isn't anything wrong with you for wanting more.

It sucks, and is absolutely something worth calling it quits for if it cant be resolved, but the fault he has is not trying harder to communicate with you about this difference. Not td that he doesn't feel like sex most of the time."
"&gt; I heard breaking up over the phone or text is a shitty thing to do.

Based on the way he's treated you, he deserves **zero** consideration. Break up with him in the safest way possible for you. 

&gt; Do I have to give everything he gave me back, including the money? 

You don't _have_ to do anything. Everything he gave you is a gift. He has no claim on the things he gave you no matter what he says. Remember, he is a liar. Anything that comes out of his mouth could be a lie or half truth. 

&gt; Also, for u/grendelone you said he will stalk me. Should I seek protection?

He has shown a propensity for stalking (like he does with his ex wife). As you are physically compromised, you have even more to be concerned about. Before you break up, you should secure your online profiles (make sure he has no access, no passwords etc) and other online accounts (banking etc.). When you break up, block him on all social media and make your profiles private. 

I don't know what your issues are with the police, but your physical safety could be at risk. Unless you think they are a bigger threat than your abusive BF, you should let them know what is going on. You should consider getting a protective order and inform your university and dorm staff. 

&gt; I guess no one will really love me ever then, huh? Something I expected, but was hoping not to be true these past few months. The good parts are nice while they lasted. Too nice to be true, but still nice.

That's your depression talking. You seem like a nice and thoughtful person. Unfortunately, some people will judge you by your physical appearance, but many will not. Make friends, be a good person, and something in the romance department will bloom. 

On a side note, you do need to seek some therapy to deal with the fallout from this abusive relationship (try to understand what happened and how he was able to manipulate you) and the other mental health issues you're struggling with."
"This is a problem with a lot of people and quite often we marry people with opposite spending habits. It happened with my parents who are now divorced. My mom was insane and sneaky with her debt and spending habits. My father was super meticulous and saved, saved, saved! Oddly I [30ish/F] ended up getting my fathers spending habits and I married someone who isn't great with budgeting. It takes years to get down a system that works. I've had to accept that we have very different ways with money. On the up side he makes all of the money and spoils me rotten if I wanted it. There's not one thing we've never been without that we didn't need or eventually wanted. My husband also wants to upgrade and we still have payments. He loves his vehicle but wants newer lol it does need some work and I've convinced him to just get it fixed and ride the payments out. I don't blame him..I want something new as well but I don't dream about it like he does."
"Wait until you meet someone you have emotional, intellectual and sexual chemistry with.  It's the best when you can have all three in one person.  Don't settle unless you're satisfied in all three aspects."
"&gt;He told me said friend isn't my friend at all and simply tolerates me.

This is something your bf told you, not something corroborated by the friend, and considering how rude your bf sounds, I would put the brakes on believing what he tells you his friends think of you unless/until you hear his friends say the words themselves.  Your bf doesn't sound reliable.

Also, who puts all of the plans into your bf's hands?  How is he able to just cancel someone else's plans?  Why didn't everyone just do the dinner on the first agreed-upon day instead of going along with your bf's cancellation?

Or is your bf such an awful person that his entire friend group has learned it's better to just let him have his way than have to deal with him being angry/sulky/whiny for however long he reacts after being told ""no""?"
"He'll believe you when he's served with divorce papers.  I suggest you have service by the Sheriff or a professional serving service so he knows it's a legitimate file.  Your lawyer will know the appropriate service in your area.
  
If you're trying to convince him you're serious about divorce because you want him to change some behavior, you're going to be sorry in the long run because he's obviously unconvinced you're capable of making that kind of decision for yourself."
Like what the shit pepper spray is serious. She was treating you like her friend hit you with a water gun. Dump her.
"Planned Parenthood will sometimes use an income-based payscale for services. Additionally, there are funds to help you pay. Check out r/auntienetwork for more info."
Umm alcoholic? Maybe consider not letting it get to 6 years. So terrible for him to blow that on his own pleasure instead of making sure you guys had food.
This.  Honestly without the details - this could be entitled artist or choosing begger territory.
"No shit.  Who starts a convo like that knowing that the other person has plans and needs to leave soon?  Him even starting that convo was a manipulative move.  He was testing if he could make her stay....she didn't, so he pulled an even more ridiculous power play.

This guy is garbage."
She was only gone for 3 hours at that point. That's a very short time when meeting with friends and family that you haven't seen in a while.
"You’re a grown adult policing the reddit subscriptions of another grown adult. Is this what you dreamed of when you imagined your ideal relationship? Arguing about porn on the internet?

He’s not going to stop or he’ll get sneaky about it. Either decide this this the hill you’re going to die on or stop stalking his account. By your own admission, you’re not being neglected and he’s not trying to connect with these women irl. This seems like a strange thing to get hung up on on you both are too old for this crap."
Ummm. What exactly is the point of going to visit him?  He is seeing someone else and wants to disrespect her by havimg his ex stay with him.  This guy sounds kind of crappy.
"I had a college friend who came from a rich family. Said college friend would invite me to her place and then buy me food almost all the time. Sometimes I don't want to hangout with her because I feel like I am a burden to her. Before she got married, she told me that I was her emotional support and then I realized that there things that money can't buy,  I.E companionship and friendship. Maybe they like you that much so they invited you to join their vacation. They must have seen something good in you, pal. Enjoy the vacay :)"
Birth control can also be pretty terrible. Maybe be a little more supportive and take some of the burden on yourself with condoms. There's a risk of pregnancy anyway while she's switching around.
"I can assure you no constituent notices or cares if a politician's son's gf takes two inches off her hair. 

Your bf is controlling, plain and simple. Politics have nothing to do with it."
Lose the boyfriend. He's a controlling hypocrite.
This is abuse. Also rape dpeending on where you live. RUn.
"I think you should trust your instinct that you’ve outgrown the relationship. 

Drinking until she blacks out is so dangerous and you’ve got better things to do than babysit her every time y’all go out. 

Her siblings telling you that you need to pay for them? That’s just tacky. Wtf. 

You’ve got a great start on your career and have an outgoing personality, don’t let this woman hold you back. 

Make it a clean break."
"I think it is important to add that OP wasn't there for the conversation, and it could have been that he was fishing for a job there ALSO, not INSTEAD OF.
I don't know what industry this is, but the amount the word 'freelancer' is used, it may not be outside of the realms of possibility that they could be after more than just the one resource. It could be entirely possible that this guy's willingness to try and work alongside an old friend again at a preferencial workplace, as been misconstrued as a betrayal."
"Sounds like her family thinks you’re rich because you’re American. She might love you idk but seems like she loves her family more. The family will keep trying to suck you dry. I doubt you’ll ever get the full amount back. I’d lay down the law that’s crazy your wife went behind your back, doesn’t respect you."
"This same thing actually happened to me except I got a text from a WhatsApp number or whatever.  Honestly, if you trust your gf like you say you do, I’d confront her directly. If she’s sketchy or weird about it then you have your answer. But just wanted to tell you from personal experience that some people are just shitty and out to cause drama in relationships when there is none. For me nothing came of it and they had no proof and I trusted my bf. 

BUT, I’m not gonna lie... its already pretty sketchy they slept in the same house together without you. Like I said tho, if you honestly trust her then you should have no reason not to confront her. I’d also confront your friend too when you have a chance just to compare reactions. But for now, just confront her."
"&gt;I have suggested couples counselling and also individual therapy for him because he clearly has an anger issue (we also both believe he is severely depressed), and he won’t.

There it is. You want him to change. He has no interest in changing."
"Good luck, and I hope you two connect! The slow approach sounds like a good one, ease into it by letting her know you're around and interested in her, and start a convo over a post you relate to at the right time later and hopefully build on that. Keep us updated!"
"It sounds like neither of you fight very fairly. You make passive-aggressive comments and threats, and he wants to record conversations seemingly to rehash arguments rather than to learn how to communicate more effectively.

I think this is a problem for couples counseling. You could both stand to work on your communication and a mediator will give you healthy strategies for doing so."
"&gt; He also tells me that I blame him for everything. I don't realize that I am blaming him.

Either you are or you are not.  If you are not, but he's telling you that you are, that's gaslighting, and that's *another* abuse tactic.

It's been *how* long?  If he's been getting significantly better over time, and he's *still* this bad, then what were you thinking at the beginning, *before* all of his improvement?"
Do you need something to eat to get you to tomorrow? I could order something. The thought of you hungry because of his selfish moronic decisions makes my heart hurt.
"They don't literally mean ""move on"" as in ""move house."" They mean dump the lame bf and move on emotionally."
"No, you did your part.  She made the mess, she can clean it up.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell her that you expect your full deposit within 30 days of the end of the lease, (send the demand letter certified mail, and a copy via email, because you're going to court.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Chances are the lease says 'broom swept' not 'spring cleaning'.    You took pictures, right?  I might agree to a walk-through, just to get those pictures.   

&amp;#x200B;

In some states you can sue for double-damages if she refuses to refund your deposit because landlords have a duty to refund deposits.  

&amp;#x200B;

But find out who is holding your deposit, your roommate or the landlord.  Go from there."
"What do you do?You ROCK ON w your bad self like Lenny Kravitz and Prince and Prince Oberian of Dorne (he’s technically bi, but who cares!) or Grace Jones! You bend gender all you want! You’re in great company. Just do you, my man. Love, a fellow androgynous unicorn."
Do not leave without your system. Honestly it sounds like he might break up with you and keep it.
"Also, at 9 yo I bet dad sees this as his last years to enjoy a trip with them as 'little girls' not pre-teens or teens. OP doesn't note how long they've been saving but if this is a once every two-three year fund then the window is gone."
"Remind him if the fact that he crashed at your place for a month *for free.* Seriously, is really shitty of him to make you pay him more than a decent hotel room would cost."
"Living with TWO needy, whiny babies."
Wow this really hit me. I really didn't think that way since he's always laughing like a kid while doing this.
Your friends are over-reacting. It's totally normal to be attracted to a certain type of genitals and not attracted to others.
Woah. A divorce threat? No way this is the first time he’s made that threat. OP this sounds way deeper than a car
"Yeah, 5 years almost with me and never ever have worked together on a budget no matter how much I try. Today we were broke so he was able to borrow $11 and he went to buy beer when we had no food. I was so pissed. So we are hungry till tomorrow when I get paid....since I buy ALL the groceries....ugh!!"
"Why is he ""giving"" you the money to pay.  You two are married right?  You're not married financially at all.  Your setup makes no sense.  if he is going to hold the money then he should pay the bills too"
"u/Defiant_Trash Please get in touch with the Brigid Alliance. They will pay for your travel costs to get an abortion. If you need help paying for the procedure itself, they will link you to the National Abortion Fund. 
If you need someone to talk to about this scary and confusing experience with your boyfriend, please call RAINN.

You don’t have to figure this out alone. We’re here for you."
I’m confused as to why you need to consult her. Why does she get to decide what you do with your body?
"Your fiancee is a shitty human being and definitely being abusive. While its one thing being angry at the amount of money, its another to get in your face about you are ""allowed"" and how your sister deserved to lose her baby. This is who is trying to marry you. 

Do you have friends and family you can reach out to? Can they bring a truck to get your stuff and move you out? Will your parents loan you the money to go see your sister?"
"People here are going to try and tell you that you're overreacting, that all men do this, etc. but it's okay if you're disgusted by this. It doesn't make you insecure to not want your boyfriend to be jerking off to someone he used to fuck. I guarantee that the dudes who'd defend this wouldn't be okay with knowing that their girlfriend masturbating to her ex or his dad/brother/friend, especially if he had a bigger dick and/or was more attractive. It's okay to set a boundary around this and it's okay to make ""masturbates to pictures of his ex"" a dealbreaker. It doesn't make you jealous or insecure or controlling."
I agree with you. How do I start the conversation w him?
"He needs grief counseling. 

My hindsight: I stayed long after the behavior I attributed to grief had become his normal. It became abuse. And it didn't end until I left. It was harder to consider leaving because ""he's grieving"" or ""just needs to figure out how to deal with his anger/loss/hardships"" had become my mantra. 

His tendency to lash out will become normal the longer you accept it as a valid way for him to grieve. Either he invests in his own healing process, or you leave. Please learn what I didn't before it consumes your relationship."
"You didn’t do anything wrong, your boyfriends friend is a witch plain and simple. Twisted your words to mean something they didn’t, then portrayed you in a bad light to your boyfriend. Her defense would be, “well I’m your best friend so I know what’s best for you” and she very well could be pining after your boyfriend or trying to keep him in a emotionally abusive friendship."
I live about 4 hours away from one. They're closed on Wednesdays but will call on Thursday. I gotta figure out how I'm going to get it taken care of. I'm willing to do anything to not become a mom before 20.
"Speak with the school.  He’s a predator and you are not safe.  The administration will probably tell him no contact or there will be consequences (although there might not be, they’ll put on a brave face)."
"Seriously, like what a dick. There are a hundred better ways to do this."
"It also could be a guy who has a crush on her that's trying to break them up.  It needs to be investigated, but no one should jump to conclusions."
"&gt;b.) it doesn't make a difference to him if our house is clean or dirty

This is a very roundabout way of saying he's a slob. He's not going to clean because you're cleaning for him, and all he has to do is pretend to be a moron. No competent grown adult is genuinely confused about how to do laundry, I figured it out completely unassisted at age 12. You can try to talk to him, but be aware that if you two get married, or buy a house, or have a kid--anything that makes it very hard for you to leave--he'll backslide all the way back to his zero effort lifestyle. And he won't ever have to deal with the consequences, because you will, because being a slob means being bothered by it last."
"I get where the guy is coming from. I was dating this man that I loved deeply but I have an almost phobia of getting pregnant. My mom's family is extremely fertile and she got pregnant 6 times, a couple times while taking the pill. Therefore, when a condom broke I had an anxiety attack. 
His feelings on this probably have nothing to do with you. 
Talk to him to see where this fear is coming from."
"&gt; I'm pretty sure the co-worker she was talking to thought it was messed up too

100%.  I would be really weirded put if a coworker told me she was lying to another coworker as a joke. ""I lied and she believed me!"" has no punchline."
I'm in my thirties. I'm using my college roommate's dad's HBO credentials.
"&gt;**The fight is what she wants**

copied for emphasis."
"&gt;or let her in when I'm at work

Cool. Ground him. His actions need to have consequences and if he's living in your home he can respect your rules. 


&gt;he'll just circumvent it and go to her apartment

That you can't do as much about unless you pay for his car. 


&gt; the time he's spending with her is leaving him little time to focus on the other aspects of his life and he often tries to cram everything he misses during the day in at night which has led to him being exhausted.


I'd start making it about that. Stop focusing so much on her specifically and focus on what unhealthy vs healthy relationships look like. Talk about how it's impacting his school work and the consequences of that. Talk about dealing with unhealthy people/relationships instead of just trying to ban her from his life."
"It seems only fair that during the weekends, you split parenting 50/50, so that means you should be able to get 4-5 hours to yourself on Sat or Sun afternoon or evening.

I think that at this time, I would stop asking him and start telling him: ""I know you're tired, do you not think I am tired too? I work full time and when I come home from work, you leave most of the parenting to me. Moreover, most of the parenting done in the weekend falls on my shoulders too. I need a few hours of personal time a week to see my friends. This is not a question I am asking you, this is me telling you that that is what I need. Considering that the time we are together I do most of the parenting, it is reasonable for me to take a few hours a week for myself. Would you prefer a set timeslot/day a week for me to have these few hours to myself or do you want to figure out during the week which day is best for both of us?""

And then leave it at that. It ridiculous you work full time and are expected to do most of the parenting when you come home. He only works part time. It's great he's going to school, but if he chooses to be part time, he chooses to take on more parenting responsibilities."
"Don’t forget he also gets incredibly offensive when OP rightfully expresses discomfort about the whole thing. Seriously, what a catch /s"
You guys need couple's therapy. Maybe also individual therapy. It sounds like she's anxious and is trying to control that anxiety by picking at you.
"The ""friend"" has known the son since aged 4. You think he turned 18 and it was a coincidence that she suddenly found him attractive?"
If I were you I would graciously accept their offer and go. I think the embarrassment you feel is not letting you assess the situation clearly. They’re not doing this out of pity but out of kindness for you and love for their daughter.
This isn't a cultural issue. Your boyfriend is a violent abusive man. There's only one thing to be done with such an individual and that is to dump him
"Your Mom is literally crazy. Sounds like possible schizophrenia tbh. How on earn that could be your fault is gaslighting to an extreme. I know because my jndad tries to blame me for his mental illness to this day. I laugh now because the idea that it is my fault for his genetics is laughable. 

Stepmom can invite you mom to events all she wants but make sure you explain to Dad that her behavior and his helping in this behavior puts him in the same boat as them. All these people honestly need to be cut off. 

Family does not mean you deserve abuse. Family does not mean hit me more. Family does not mean take my hand while your drowning and make me drown too. 

But your Mom is mentally ill. For you please learn to forgive what she mentally cannot be. That does not mean you need to have any relationship with her. It just means that you understand this is not necessarily about YOU being her target so much as you being the target of her mental illness."
"It sounds like she doesn't like how you look hairless, and she just doesn't want to tell you straight. But, of course it is entirely your choice."
"Why on earth do you believe him when he says “definitely before 30”? Because it sounds like it was also “definitely when he graduates” and “definitely before you’re 27” or “definitely after biweekly talks” none of which ever happened. 

Him telling you he wants to marry you is useless without any backup or follow through. It’s a totally meaningless statement. I think the thing that stood out to me the most was him saying that just because other people are saying you should get married doesn’t mean it should rush your judgment. But it’s not “other people” - it’s you, his partner of four years, telling him that you want to get married! And it’s not like your judgement’s been rushed; your timeline’s been clear for what sounds like the better part of a decade. 

Do you really *want* to marry someone who you’ve had to beg, plead, drag, coddle, and ultimately force via ultimatum to marry you?"
"Plan B won't work if she's had a positive pregnancy test, it won't induce an abortion, it only prevents fertilization and implantation. OP should contact Planned Parenthood or the local equivalent if she decides not to continue the pregnancy."
"&gt;so he's trying to ""punish"" you by making everything awkward and strained.

... so that next time, you'll decide it's easier to just let him sexually harass you."
"&gt; This could be a really awesome mother-daughter Bonding experience 

No it can't, because she's incapable of it. Re-read what you wrote as if it was a friend talking about *their* parent. She's accusing you of things, besmirching your boyfriend, has switched from wanting you to move out to objecting that you're going...*she's not rational!* 

This isn't about ""easing her worries"", because you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into. And, bluntly, her feelings are not your responsibility. Of course it's normal to care, you don't want to say ""screw you mom, I'm off"", but you're not doing that - you're moving out at age 25, as many people do, and she's **screaming about it**. That's not ""worries"", that's manipulation and control. Normal parents don't act this way when their kids move out - they just don't. At most it might be a bit sad, a bit of ""empty nest syndrome"", not **this**.

Bluntly, she needs therapy. This isn't ""nerves"", and you're under no obligation to demonstrate to her that you can afford to move out or anything else. You're an adult, you're making a perfectly decent decision for yourself about your own life. There's no point arguing with her, because you can't win her over, she won't accept a reasonable point of view. **She wants to be mad**. She was angry with you for not moving out when you lived at home, now she's angry with you for not living at home when you're moving out. You can't win!

Don't show her receipts, because that's just feeding into her anxieties. Have a come to Jesus talk with her where you flat out tell her that her behaviour is driving a wedge between you and making you want to see her less, not more. You can sympathise with her concerns but reassure her it's all in hand, but ALSO tell her you **will not tolerate** being called named or her speaking badly about your boyfriend. Because if she's going to treat you like that, why would you even visit her or call her? Why subject yourself to treatment like that?

Her behaviour **is not normal**, and shouldn't be treated as if it is."
"This is the only answer for you, OP."
"&gt; He’ll say all that red-flag type stuff, then in the same conversation say “I can see you potentially as my wife. I love you, I don’t want to lose you. You make me happy”.

One of those things is true and the other is just something he says to keep you around and get laid ... not hard to figure out which is which. 

Time to move on from this dud."
It’s not his decision. It’s yours. And it sounds like he did tamper with your birth control. If I was you I would end the relationship and terminate the pregnancy.
"Dude, your boyfriend is manipulative and an asshole. He comes off like the classic abuser. A charming facade but an absolutely poisonous person underneath it all. 

OP, do you feel like this guy meets your needs and actually cares about you? Do you want to date someone who can't handle anyone else being the center of attention for just one bit? This is who your boyfriend is and that isn't going to change. Do you have a problem with it? He has a pattern of making other peoples' special days all about himself. That is a pattern showing you that he only cares about himself IMO."
"Here's the thing:  You cannot help someone with a mental disorder if they refuse to get help.  This has to come from them.  It's like trying to help an alcoholic quit drinking.  YOU cannot do anything.  HE has to recognize that this is severely impacting his life, and HE has to be the one to realize that it's gotten out of hand.  

So what you have to do is... recognize that this not something that's going to get better, and in all probability will get worse as time goes on.  The only thing you can do is what no one actually wants to do or contemplate. Decide how bad it has to get before you put down an ultimatum that either he gets help, or you leave him.  And then you actually have to do it.   It sucks, and its harsh, but that's what it is.   Which doesn't mean you are at that stage NOW.  It just means you need to be aware that the day will come.  So you need to be upfront with him, that you can't live like this forever and he is going to have to get help at some point.  But decide if this is something you can live with, really, and exactly how bad it can get before it breaks you."
If you're not his first choice now then you will never be. You should **always** be your partner's first choice.
Absolutely.  He doesn't own her just because they're in a relationship and she's staying at his apartment.
"/u/throwawaychqis , they already said that they paid for you to go with them on this resort vacation.  They like you.  This is a gift.  I understand that, coming from a poor background, this seems like an extremely extravagant gift and it's overwhelming to you, but it is a gift that they've already paid for and are offering to you.

Accept it.  Go with them.  Be thankful.  Enjoy it.  Continue treating your girlfriend right.  Your girlfriends' parents seem like decent people, and they want to do something nice for you and see you enjoy it.

As other posters have suggested, make a Thank You card for them.  Get them a thoughtful gift in return: it doesn't have to be expensive (buy or create a gift that's within your means), but it should be something that they can get sentimental about.  Ask your girlfriend for ideas."
"Run the fuck away. What a gross, despicable loser. This is a situation where ghosting is extremely acceptable: he's abusive, dangerous, and doesn't care about your boundaries and wellbeing. Make plans, and get the fuck out as soon as you can, and never let him know your intentions."
Thank you so much &lt;3
"I think you know that you're unhappy in this relationship and your BF will not give you what you want. From what I've read, I agree with the other comment that he does not want to marry you.

Also, I'm confused by why you think if you leave him that you are giving up your dreams when you are already doing that now. The longer you stay with him, the more likely you will not be married and will not have bio children."
"100%. Buy some drinks for the family on holiday. A card afterwards to thank them is a lovely touch, too."
"For this particular work environment, I second this.

At the very least, maybe your nominal supervisor can at least explain where this high schoolesque bullying is coming from.

There are some instances in later life where it might be better to move on but given that you previously enjoyed this, it's worth trying to save things.

Also isn't there a relatively sympathetic person who works there that you could ask about this?"
"So let’s see. Your husband:

1. Ignores you when hanging out with her,
2. Has already had one marriage fall apart over her,
3. Attempts to control how you dress and who you spend time with,
4. Lies to you about the basic facts of this friendship, and 
5. Tells you you’re the asshole when you bring up your (very understandable) concerns. 

What a prize. 

It sounds to me like your husband is one of those people that convinces himself it’s not an affair unless he’s actively fucking her (which, honestly, he might be). Until his dick is inside her (and you’ve caught him) he hasn’t done anything “wrong.” But that’s a lie he tells himself, and his paranoia about *your* behavior gives the game away. He knows he’s crossing lines and that what he’s doing is hurtful - he’s scared you’re going to do the same thing if left alone with your male friends for too long. He figures if it’s easy for *him* to sneak and lie, it’s just as easy for you. 

He’s never going to marry her, and she’s never going to marry him. They prefer this codependent, adolescent, I’m-not-actually-fucking-her-so-what’s-the-problem relationship. If they went legitimate with it, it’d kill the fun. He’ll keep locking down other women and messing with her on the side, and she’ll keep lording her other-woman status over his partners because it makes her feel special and chosen. She gets to see girlfriends and wives come and go, but she’s gonna be around him *forever*. It’s not uncommon among desperately insecure and self-centered people.  

In short, throw this one back in the pond, OP. You were never gonna be his #1."
"Op, can I suggest you go see a therapist about this? Just to get an idea of what 'normal' should be when it comes to relationships and what to expect from a guy.

Just so you never have to ask if you have high standards again.

(Also, can I add as well, that you don't NEED to date.  Please allow that option into your life - you can be happy, healthy and complete without being in a relationship)"
"I appreciate your passion 😁 but op please don’t do this haha.

Talk about stuff before he initiates again. Or if he does try to initiate, turn him down a bit gently and tell him you guys need to have a serious talk. It’s best to not spring this stuff on him without notice, and talking about it at a neutral time is best, if possible.

But do feel free to turn him down forcefully OP if he won’t listen to you. NEVER have sex you don’t want. If you have to yell at him and get angry to make him stop — then do that. Just tryyy to avoid it at first if possible and again to warn him and communicate that you have not been enjoying sex and you want things to change (and propose some changes.) Otherwise get as pissed as you want if you try to stop him and he pressures you anyway. Your right to say no is important!"
"Yeahhhhhh, I don't like this playing-hard-to-get-oh-wait-are-losing-interest-here-let-me-come-on-hard routine.

The moment he feels you're back in his orbit?  He'll grow a little distant again and pull back.

So.  Since the two of you had hammered out some ground rules, you do need to tell him that you've thought about it and you're feeling ambivalent now:  at the end of the day, you want a relationship, he doesn't and you're  not super thrilled to be hanging around while he makes up his mind.  Tell him you want to pursue other possibilities while he's working through his shit, and then ask him what he thinks.

He will have thoughts.  One or two, I imagine.  Listen to what he has to say and take him at his word:  if he insists that he's not ready, then...he's not ready.  Can he give you a timeline?  Does he know what he needs to ""be ready?""  Does he want to break things off and then check in again in a few months to see how he feels about the kind of commitment that you want?

Do be on the watch for any attempt to jerk you around--you know, saying what you want to hear to keep you around, but never actually following through with it.  Or, of course, the whole growing distant when he can take you for granted thing:  that's always no bueno.

But, yeah, you gotta tell him if you want to date other people."
"he pretty much had a similar excuse, he ""thought I would go crazy"". Except can't give any reason why I would. I didn't even blink an eye when he and a female co-worker went out of town for training with their work, I've never had an issue with him having female friends."
"You need to... move out of your parent's house.

You have no business getting married if you still live with your parents. Come on.

Beyond that, you have no business having a kid if you're too embarrassed to tell your parents you're pregnant. You do know you're gonna have to teach *them* this stuff someday, right?

If you have no money, then you need to sort your lives out before you think about having a wedding.

Honestly this whole situation sounds like you're not mature enough to even be considering any of this. Go do some work on yourselves."
"If you are already planning on breaking up with someone, you should just do it. Yes it's awkward to have to live with someone after breaking up, but isn't that better than putting up with him and having sex with him when he treats you like this? Of course this isn't normal, it's disgusting behavior. Just break up with him now."
"Dude! You're literally worried about him throwing a tantrum. Is he super immature in other areas or just this? I'm guessing not just this. Maybe a kind bit firm hand here is good because he needs to grow up and if you don't want to just cut him loose to grow up on his own (I wouldn't break up over this one issue but I'd also be forward) then he will have to learn to deal with it.

He wants to have a switch without paying for it? That's not the way the world works. He's not sharing it with you which was an option for him here but instead he decides he wanted the whole thing and that all he had to do was push you around till you let him have it. What a jerk."
Yes he is getting pleasure from treating you like this.  RUN!
"The second your mom called your girlfriend a ""slut"" you should have ended the conversation.  And stopped contact with your parents until she apologized and started acting like an adult."
"He is almost 17 and has a few more years of high school. I have been reading r teenagers and the kids there seem to have issues moving so late in the game.

I knew that this was coming for a while and just hoped to get through this until he left for uni. Then I would up sticks and leave permanently, but atm he is settled and happy in his school, something I never had."
"The driving off with the kids in a huff really seals the deal. Great communication style here. If I were OP I’d be talking to lawyer, stat."
"I know it all seems overwhelming and like this is your best shot. I know that because I was in a very similar situation. From 26 to 32 I was in a relationship with someone who said she wanted to marry me but kept putting it off. 

When it comes to marriage, anything less than an enthusiastic “yes” is a “no.” It took me far too long to realize that. By the time we split when I was 32, I was so fatigued by wondering if we’d ever get married and have kids that I gave up on dating. 

I’m 37 now. And yes, I’d hoped to be started with kids by 30, but sometimes things happen in their own time. In my own time, I’m currently planning a wedding to a wonderful woman who is just as excited as I am to build a life together. And the difference is astonishing. Talks about our future are joyful, not strained. 

As much as I’m dreading possible fertility struggles, I am so glad I didn’t somehow convince my ex to get married and have kids when she didn’t want to. I’m so glad I took some time away from dating to work on what I wanted my life to look like. 

As you get older, you have a better sense of what you want, and you don’t necessarily have to date for 4+ years to know something is right. If you break this off, even if you spend time working on yourself and not dating you could still be married by 30. You just need to find the person who is as excited to marry you as you are to marrying them, and being older is an advantage here because you’re both more likely to know what you want. On my first date with my future wife I literally said “I want kids and marriage, do you?” so I could know we were on the same page before going further. 

Waiting for this guy to stop moving the goalposts is just going to result in your clock running out and you having regrets. This isn’t your only shot."
"I’m not following the “it’s not his fault” logic. Did you magically get pregnant on your own? He’s being selfish. He’s making choices and you’re making all the sacrifices. 


I’m very confused how there’s always $$ for his trips but not for yours. /s


Solution: sit down and make a budget, each of you get equal fun money. Fun money goes into your own personal accounts. Going forward there’s no longer a problem if there’s fun money because it’s either in the account or not."
Engagements are not legally binding. It’s time to get out of that relationship. Nor is this acceptable behavior just because he’s Chinese. That’s a bullshit reason. He’s a violent misogynist is what he is.
"If you can, I’d find out what the rumour was just so you can be as informed as possible. Then either a) find out who’s responsible and escalate as it’s impacting your work environment b) if there’s any truth to it and it’s not complimentary, know when to bow out."
"Are you sure that it's not *you* who doesn't want to admit that maybe your gut reaction was uncalled for and wrong? It's insane to donate your entire family holiday budget to a charity because two nine-year olds are 'stubborn'. You're the adults, there are a ton of ways in which you can manage this situation so your girls aren't disappointed. There are a lot of great examples in the comments. ""That's cute but obviously not"" sounds like a totally reasonable reaction, I don't get how you could be so angry about that. And why it's so important to you that your husband 'admits' that he would enjoy a holiday."
"&gt; he'll pull me out of the drivers seat so he can drive if I dont get out voluntarily

Bordering on some kind of abuse happening there.  You're not crazy.  When I first began reading your post, I thought it was quite a petty issue.  The more I read, the more I realised there's some major issues here.

Have you spoken to him about it? You really need to address this with me and explain it in a respectful, but honest way.  Let him know how his extreme behaviour makes you feel - because yes, prying keys out of your hands or removing you from a car is *extreme* behaviour.

Could be a whole host of reasons behind it - you won't know until you talk to him about it:

- Might be stuck in old fashioned gender role views; and feel the need to ""be the man"" and drive the girl everywhere.

- Might feel unsafe by your driving.

- Could've been in car accidents as a passenger before, or had ex-girlfriends involved in car accidents in which they were driving.

- Might get car sickness or severe anxiety in car rides - people will often find this can improve when they're the ones in control and driving.

- He might just be a major control freak with issues, and has a lowly opinion of you and your ability to do certain things.

Just talk to him.  Just explain about how it makes you *feel*."
"&gt; I feel like family should get the best of you no matter what.

But your brother doesn't think that. If he had that value, he wouldn't be treating his kids the way he does."
"I mention struggles to my family and anyone overhearing would probably think my problems are small. But I don't tell any of them about my depression,or struggles with an eating disorder. From the outside people think I have it all together and that my life is awesome. They don't know that the 14lb I lost is from bulimia, not from me being awesome and having my shit together. You have no idea what's going on in other peoples lives."
"You *do* realize that the party itself was for an SO, right? You would have been more than justified in being there.

Also, seven years of largely long distance and then this? He is being noncommittal. Before, he got the benefit of being taken without the reality of being in a relationship. Don't LOL this away to be the Cool Girlfriend."
"Yeah, like what's the dad doing about all this? Just sitting there with some popcorn?"
"I feel like OP is looking for some magical answer that doesn't involve her s/o being a manipulative jerk, which will unfortunately never come, because that's what he is. He cancelled his best friend's plans, on his best friend's birthday. He told OP to leave on her OWN TRIP."
"What your mom chose to do was really horrible.   She cheated on her husband with a barely legal kid.   She betrayed him and quite frankly this much of an age gap is worrisome.   Your mom quite frankly is gross.

Has she apologized to you for the way she treated your father?  Has she apologized to you for the affair and the lies that go along with an affair?   

Your stepfather (my god, a year younger then you) isn't blameless, although given his youth and inexperience no doubt easily malleable.   Still - why play friends with a guy who would get involved with a married woman?  He is also gross.

That your dad remarried and has a new family doesn't exonerate your mother and her choices.  After all, it could just as easily gone the other way with your dad miserable and alone.  Then what?  

Do whatever feels genuine to you.  It may be just the occassional group events.  It may be that one day you become close again.   But honestly, unless she gives a genuine apology with no lies or fudging the truth to make herself look better I really don't see the point in attempting reconciliation."
"I think the actual price is important here as well, and the dimensions of the piece. I mentioned it in another comment, but people who aren't in the art world generally have no idea what art costs. The friend should have given a quote regardless, but it's possible they truly are giving a discounted price and it's just sticker shock for someone who isn't accustomed to how expensive art is."
"I’m with your husband. Vacations are a very important part of life and particularly childhood. I have life long lasting memories from our Disney trips and I’m not even into Disney as an adult. It’s very sweet that your girls want to take care of the homeless and their heart is in the right place but I can guarantee you they have no idea how much money $5,000 is or how much work it took you guys to earn it. There is a reason we adults handle the money and don’t let our 9 year olds make financial decisions."
"yeah like she shouldn't \*have\* to give him that money, I agree he's got more than his money's worth out of it, but it definitely would shut down any argument about 'I paid for this too', because he is really unfairly using it as leverage. Take the leverage away.

If she really wanted to shut him up she could calculate the cost of renting the console for the amount of time he's had it - I'd be pretty sure it'd be more than a hundred bucks."
"I would say all 3. 

Call him out, educate him, then call it off."
"Agreed. I don't think OP's wrong for having her own personal boundaries or dealbreakers, but she's handling this situation in the complete wrong way.

OP, if you have a boundary/dealbreaker around reddit porn, yet your partner (who clearly knows about this boundary) keeps looking at it anyway...it is **on you** to actually hold to that dealbreaker and leave the relationship. Either that, or decide it's *not* actually a dealbreaker, and you need to learn to be okay with it.

You don't get to police your BF's internet activity. You don't get to declare things are ""off limits"", constantly monitor your partner's reddit usage, or demand that he not do something.

If there's something you won't tolerate in your relationships, you make that boundary clear (which you have), and then you leave when that boundary is intentionally broken, multiple times."
You sound incompatible. He's someone that likes to jerk off to real people on reddit and does not apologize for lying as long as he thinks he shouldn't have to. You're someone who doesn't like either of these things. Sounds like he doesn't want to change. So what will you do about it?
"It’s such petty junior high BS. 
She’s an adult and as such needs to use her words. 

Cut your losses OP and realize that you dodged a bullet."
"I don’t normally comment on this sub, but having just been in this situation as the boyfriend with neurotrauma, I feel like I have some perspective. My girlfriend experienced a major trauma by watching me go through a major trauma. Her self preservation went out the window in favor of making sure I was looked after. The biggest help to her (and eventually us) was my parents coming into town and handling the minor day to day details. Offering your place to stay is a great start. Cooking a meal, helping out with housework, grocery shopping, all those little things that kept life moving along for her were what she needed most. Of course, making yourself available as a friend who’s there to talk if she wants is also great, but understand that she might not want to do that. Just being available goes a long way. Good luck to all of you."
This is all your fault dude. You just couldn't stop stirring up drama and flip flopping between two people. You can't control what she does. I don't know how you are even surprised considering how unstable the two of you obviously are.
"Planned Parenthood has encountered countless women who cannot afford that and I have yet to hear of them turning someone away. The treatment costs shown on the website are likely the worst case scenario. From what I've heard, they charge on a ""sliding scale"" which is based on income and at the very least they should offer you a very reasonable payment plan so you don't need the money up front...btw...childbirth (in a US hospital) alone, not to mention 18 years of caring for a child is exponentially more expensive!"
"At this point, does it even matter if he can change? I think the real question is: Can you ever believe him again? Frankly, I could not, because he has never been honest in the entirety of your relationship. You don't even know what him being open and honest looks like."
This comment is actually answering the question.
"&gt;Schedule an sonnet with a family attorney asap.

And make sure it's a good one. Don't pay for a haiku at sonnet prices."
Then you know capable of controlling it. He just won’t.
It's...really weird that you don't see this behaviour as *completely mental*. The first time anyone tried to drag me out of the car would be the last time.
"Ouch. 

Are we sure this guy was marriage material? Because this is some teenager-logic. You don’t have to “prove” you can handle a task before you can earn your spouse’s support and encouragement.

Kinda sounds like he doesn’t want you to go back to school for some reason."
"Break up with her. Her religious beliefs are important to her. You have absolutely no right to try to pressure her into sex.

If sex is that important to you, find a new partner that is willing to have sex with you and leave your current girlfriend alone."
"&gt; It makes me wonder how he’d be as a father though I’d never tell him that because I know it would really hurt him. 

Relationships are built on communication. It is important for him to know that you’re worried about this. 

Look, there are only a few options here for him:

- He agrees that it would be a problem if you had a kid, and he works on it earnestly before you get pregnant (great!)

- He thinks he can control it if you had a kid (and if he can control it, then you need to ask him why he hasn’t been able to control it for you)

- He doesn’t think snapping is a problem (then you’ll know this is who he is, and you’ll need to decide if this is what you want for your life)"
"Nah dude. This is a shit show waiting to happen. What exactly do you expect to get out of visiting him at this point? If you do go visit, don't stay at his place.

How would you feel if you were in a relationship with someone and they invited their long distance ex to stay with them for some time?"
"My ex did this. I'd have plans, he'd pick a fight and throw a tantrum, then ""break up with me"" right before I was supposed to leave.

The last fight I left anyway and had 3 days off the cold shoulder. When he started acting like things were fine again I reminded him he broke up with me and I wasn't going to beg him to take me back. Best decision I made"
"Supporting someone around a death can feel hard / confusing because there's nothing that can be fixed about the situation. What people want/need can vary a lot. My biggest advice is to follow their lead but to continue to gently reach out unless told not to. 

If there is a funeral or memorial of some type - attend. 

Send flowers and a card (keep the text simple - just that you are sorry for their loss, love them and are there for them. Don't try to say anything profound or religious or try to fix it). 

Check with family members who are closer to them to see what specific things they need. 

Remember they will grieve this for a very long time, possibly forever. You don't have to bring it up specifically but reaching out in a month, a few months, a year, etc just to say you are thinking of them means a lot."
"The fact that he is phrasing everything through the lens of being ""allowed"" to do stuff or having to be ""told"" what to do is very concerning here. He's an adult, he can deal with his own shit. 

How often does he find a way to blame you for his own fuckups?"
"He says elsewhere it’s been a decade....

His mother groomed an 18 year old child and destroyed her marriage for it. I don’t think that’s something you can “separate” really. 

That’s...horrifying."
"I love this. It would good to emphasize how family are people who you choose, not by accident of birth.

Or casually mention how fame and money changes things. Like people who originally didn't give a fig about you, now to claim they are the reason for your success"
"That’s quite an age gap. But the appropriateness of your dad’s relationship is not your problem. Of course it’s hard to say to him “dude wtf she is way too young for you” - he’s your dad. Saying that is the job of his friends, or brothers. 

Are there other adults in your life that you can talk to about your feelings about this? How does his girlfriend treat you?"
Not overreacting. Unfriend button is warranted here.
"Since the friends have an issue with op, maybe one of them can make things right by dating the guy for her. You know, put up or shut up."
Give him his $100 back and say he can come over and play it when he wants but it lives at your house from now on moving forward.
So who's usually doing the emotional labour in this relationship?
"Eh, if you read some of his responses, she got her teenage brother kicked out of their house by outing him to their dad, because she thought it was funny.

I'd lay down in traffic for my brother, no matter their sexual orientation. There's no fixing that."

"&gt;If I buy a pair of $80 shoes in the wrong size, I don't get to through a fit about it when I can't wear 'em. He bought an $80 game for a console he doesn't actually own, so he can't play it.

&gt;This isn't his first game system. He knows how these things work.

And he CAN play it, when he's with his gf at her house with her switch there."
"I think grey rock is good. But if the mom keeps persisting I think a honest, calm, conversation might help.

Something along the lines of

I appreciate your concern but would appreciate if you stopped making comments about my appearance or eating habits. If I need help with anything I will let you know"""
"As much as I hate to say it, you’re obviously his second choice. Dump him before he dumps you when his ex wife comes calling. You deserve so much better. He’s a half-assed man and you don’t need or want that"
I don’t think we can realistically expect OP to tackle shady restaurant practices all by herself while she has an unstable boyfriend and an unwanted pregnancy to deal with. Servers get shorted all the time and it’s very difficult to enforce employment laws. The restaurant industry has a bad track record with labor rights.
"What your parents want doesn’t matter. Tricking someone into pregnancy IS a form of rape. Abort, tell him it’s a miscarriage, break up with him and cut off contact. I can’t believe you were giving this guy money.... I know it’s hard but you NEED to grow a backbone now, being tied to this abusive piece of shit forever by a baby will absolutely ruin your life."
Check your bank account.
"Ew ew ew ew. I would ban her from the house. She's a predator. I'm 29 and 18 year old boys are children. Shit, 20-23 year old boys look too young nowadays.

"I would listen to a healthcare professional if you are experiencing those symptoms. 
Educate yourself in order to make the right decision for you and no one else. 
Therapy is essential and medication can be short term or long term. Depends on the imbalance. 
Confide in a loved one or someone you trust, outside of your relationship. They may provided you with a different perspective while also providing support. 
Good Luck!"
"&gt; My psychiatrist offered me meds, but i refused because i didn't want to be dependent on meds.

I have OCD myself since 9. I'm now 30.
I've started taking medicines at 20 and it changed my life. Please don't make the same mistake. Take a treatment.


&gt; I don't know if i should respect his decision or try to convince him to stay and work things out.

This guy have no respect for you. Do you really want to have a boyfriend who think you are ""crazy""?
None of my girlfriends have given a shit about my OCD. You deserve WAY better than this guy.

DM opens if needed."
"You didn’t just dump him over the lack of sex but rather his determination to act like your needs didn’t matter, he did not want to work on the relationship and figure shit out. It can’t be one sided. Good for you for doing what is right for you. Your needs deserve to be met and girl go you!  If I were you I would go on some fun dates, no strings and enjoy myself."
"I mean, I wouldn't do this to a casual acquaintance or a stranger, either - it's kind of just a shitty thing to do, period"
"Yeah, My father ain't a nice man, I'll say that now. I was defiantly thinking about blowing up but I was told to focus on the pain and it going away,  Let yourself know that your fucked for the next hour and nothing you can do about it. 

But this is why I was wondering if it was something to break up over, She is a great girl but this act she did is not helping her case at all.

Thanks for your input, I don't want to be a push over and be like that for the rest of my life, My father still has his effect on me, Sadly."
"So true. I had recently broken up with a guy and was surprised when he became a hateful, vindictive Nice Guy™️ that bemoaned the fact that girls only wanted abusive guys, and told me I should go back to my abusive ex. He insulted my roommate when she reached out to him.

I found out recently that before we had broken up, he had written a list of ways to “ruin my life” if I ever broke up with him. We had been dating for 4 months."
"Yep. And we know a LOT of the same people. I don't want to burn bridges or get on his bad side, but it was a pretty selfish move."
Wait you apologized to him? Girl get a spine and a divorce.
Hey. After this long of dating him... it was totally your business.
Agree. Talking to him will not go good. There's really nothing more to talk about anyway as it's over. Don't let guilt fool you into thinking that you should give him closure. He said the relationship wasn't working due to long distance then he locked you out. If he later babbles about needing to talk for closure (probably his excuse to try &amp; ride you back in) tell him the closure was him closing the door &amp; locking you out. Game over.
"How exactly would you go about ""dealing with this on your own""? 

I dont know about you, but once I start playing anxious detective, I have a REALLY REALLY hard time quashing that intrusive ""what if?"" until I have some evidence that counters the suggestive clues I've been collecting.

Do you really think you'll stop hunting for clues just because you've decided to? Do you really feel like you can help yourself? Based on the clues you've described here, I think I'd have a hard time just forgetting about it if I were in your position.

I'm a big advocate for open and honest dialogue, ESPECIALLY about fears that may or may not be rooted in anything other than anxiety. So, on that alone, I think you should talk to him about it.

But I also want to say that based ONLY on what you've said here, I think the most logical explanation for his behavior is that he has or at one point had a crush on her, and so it's sort of colored his dynamic with her in a way that is different from his other friends. I also think it's possible that he's stuffed this pretty deep down, and is not CONSCIOUSLY trying to leave space for her to one day fall into his arms.

This is to say--maybe DONT lead with the ""maybe this is all in my head"" bit. It will make it TOO easy in the moment for him to agree--yes, this is all in your head, silly! If, let's say, he's repressing a crush on her, it WILL sound crazy the first time he hears someone suggest it out loud. And then, once he basically tells you you're crazy, theres not a good way for him to reopen the conversation later without feeling like a manipulative, sneaky trickle truther.

I'd recommend laying it out for him as objectively as possible--you've noticed he treats you differently around her than he does around his other friends. You've noticed that he's cold to her fiance. You're worried he might be subconsciously nurturing a little bit of a crush on her, and you're worried that it will eventually become a problem if you dont talk about it now. And then give him space to share his side of things.

I dont think you're crazy, but you DO need to stop playing detective before you make yourself crazy."
"If she isn’t even talking to you guys now, then I don’t think it’s an issue whether your husbands ex goes to family gatherings."
"The friend caused the problem by refusing to specify a price.  Your mom shouldn't feel bad about telling her it's too much, and if she'd just told your mom the price when she was asked there would have been no problem."
This is divorce worthy. He's creeping on your SISTER. What a violation of trust for both of you.
"Can't help but think the baby is actually an excuse so she's stuck with him and can never leave. I mean, his behavior getting more and more sketchy and shady is already a big red flag, he's also controlling/entitled about money etc, but now he's also getting ridiculously angry that she has legitimate doubts about getting a baby at 19? This truly sounds like this relationship is slowly but surely becoming abusive, and a baby would make *everything* worse. I may sound paranoid but better safe than sorry, fucking RUN, op."
It doesn't even matter if he won't cheat: he's still treating you badly with his behavior. Just because he's not doing the worst things doesn't mean you don't don't deserve better.
Best to just ask him. I would just say what you said here to everyone else. But just come at it with curiosity words. Like Hey i've been noticing XYZ and I like it and/or love it but Im wondering where all of this came from?? If it was a lot of bad stuff you would have to speak with him about it. So good stuff you cant do the same? Just talk to him is your best bet. Dont be scared to just talk to him in a normal conversation. If you come at him with 20 million questions he may be a little stand offish. Talk about the good things and you can slowly bring up the not so good things.
"Well his dad is a lawyer and got my mom out of a drunk driving situation, my parents kinda suck too. Mom's a full blown alcoholic and dad is just an enabler. They love anyone who has a better ""class"" status than them. They know his father makes bank so I think that's why they love him so much...love up to him so we get married and they can get that $$. I don't know if they'd even believe me if I told them how he acted towards me"
"Yep.  Be ready for this and remember ""No."" is perfectly acceptable and needs neither repeating or explaining."
"I‘m sceptical: if I wanted my boyfriend to make a proposal, I wouldn’t lay hints about my bisexuality."
"People like this love it when you bring up their shitty behavior because then they can be like ""omg no I don't/you take everything so serious"" and try to make you and others think you're just being overly sensitive. I'd stick to the grey rock approach myself because I doubt this woman is this old and totally unaware of what is and isn't appropriate."
"This isnt about gaming. This is about him not putting any work into a marriage.

I'd just as him: are you in this marriage or not? If yes, act like it. Be a partner. 

If no, get out. It's only been two years. 

Also, for the love of God do not have a kid with this guy, unless you are imagining life as a single mother, with this guy in your life forever."
Yeah that's fucked up and makes me think he wants money for something.
You should read about Oscar Pistorius. Famous track runner. Shot his girlfriend in the bathroom of there own home late one night. Claimed he thought she was a burglar. Pretty wild.
"&gt; as far as he's concerned he'd happily never have sex again in his life!!!

Oof, this is a really tough one, OP. It clearly isn't about you and he means it when he says it's his libido. One or two times a month is already a compromise on his end and if you want to be treated like a sex goddess, it's very obvious he's not the person who is going to do it.

&gt; I am happily married. I am off the market. I shouldn't care whether or not I am attractive!

Honey, these desires don't just spontaneously die because you have a ring on your finger. You are ALLOWED to want to feel attractive and desired! That's a basic human want and people of all ages and relationship statuses crave it.

I think this is a moment for both couples counseling and individual therapy for you. Perhaps you can find other ways for your husband to make you feel desired, but you need to help him understand how crucial it is to you because if it's not something he craves, it might be hard for him to understand just how fundamental of a need it is for you. I'd imagine him working harder on words of affirmation would help, but I think you can brainstorm together about what would fulfill that need for you.

I'm sorry you're in this situation, it truly sounds difficult and I hope you guys can find a happy medium."
No. He made the decision to risk his real partner finding out. He doesn't respect either her or you.
"&gt;Having sex 2 times a month is NOT normal when we see each other 14 days a month

You have to do what's right for you always, but this is really not right. It's an unhealthy view of sex for you to think there's a normal standard of sex you have to work up to."
"I am not sure the type of city/ town you live in (guessing it’s a small one where everyone knows everyone). 

Something I have seen before (might not apply to you) - is local newspapers do write up about personal stories of achievement. Perhaps you would like to tell your story in a local article about your experience growing up, the moment you found out how your parents abandon you, your struggles, your ability to overcome adversity, where you are now and how people previously shunted you are now trying to get into your life. That, would shut them up for good.


Don’t contact them ever again. The friends that know both you and them, tell them straight up you don’t want anything to do with your family and never to speak about them to you. They are toxic to you and hearing about them all the time are just continual cuts into you soul."
"Trans guy here. You’re totally allowed to have a genital preference. It’s a huge spot of contention but, genital preferences are allowed. However, it’s when you have a huge sweeping generalization of “oh I don’t date trans people because XYZ reasons” that you crawl into transphobic territory. There’s so many stealth trans men that you “can’t tell” their original assigned sex at birth, with fully functional penises that genuinely look like a penis one would be born with. However, even within that, maybe you want to be able to have your own biological children one day. Again, totally chill reason to not want to date a guy who can’t reproduce a biological child. However, there’s no need to make that all on trans guys, because plenty of cis guy can’t have their own biological children as well. Like I promise you can remove the trans reasoning and still have plenty of valid, non transphobic reasons to not want to date this specific trans guy. I’m open to answering questions, even not the best worded ones, as long as there’s good faith. :)"
"1) most people do get heightened feelings/emotions on birthdays and death dates.

"Just keep a good distance from your parents and stick up for your gf and the right to make your own choices about your life if they say or do anything inappropriate. Keep your parents on an information diet. 

If you need to, tell your gf that your parents are a little racist and they disapprove of you having premarital sex, so you don’t want to put her in a position where they may say or do something offensive. Reassure your gf that you care for her and that you recognize your parents are 100% wrong."

Plan B is to prevent pregnancy i.r stop a fertilized egg from implanting. If she’s had a positive pregnancy test it’s much too late for that. She’s pregnant and has to terminate the pregnancy. Not Plan B

"&gt; You might be thinking “be patient, he has a lot on his plate right now, stop making it about yourself” 

Nope that's not what I'm thinking at all. I'm thinking you're in an abusive relationship. Not exaggerating, your relationship is abusive. Maybe it's only 10% abusive, but is that really something to brag about?

You're not being a martyr or making this all about you when you want your husband (the person who is supposed to love you!) to treat you with basic respect. You've phrased it well, you've brought it up in all the correct ways. His response always boils down to ""Well I'm right and you're the one that needs to change"". You've told him he scares you and he doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't care. He doesn't want to change at all. The solution to abusive behaviors is to LEAVE.

Read ""Why does he do that"" and go to loveisrespect.org. Open your eyes and stop making excuses for him. This is not acceptable."
"Honestly puts a pit in my stomachache, I’d be asking “Where’s the spark?” You deserve to know he cares. That’s what keep long term couples together, always trying, saying good mornings, I love yous, how was your drive home, etc. I’m sorry :("
"You can only control your own actions. 
Sitting around hoping/wishing that he will leave you so that he will be the bad guy instead is really immature — if you no longer want to be in the relationship, you are equally entitled to end it."
And then remove the hand.  Keep removing the hand until he gets the hint.  Dude seems pretty sketchy and is probably used to getting his way with this stuff.
"If his friend took his SO, I know he would've taken me. He just has this weird thing where he feels like he's always the guy bringing his gf to stuff with his friends (when it was appropriate of course).

"not to mention, kids wont' be little forever. In just a few years they'll have little interest in disney or family vacations. enjoy it now."
"So, the thing to watch out for, it’s really common to fall into another abusive relationship after getting out of one. The way it usually happens is the new person either *abuses you less severely* or, he *abuses you differently*. 

You end up comparing this to your previous relationship and it seems better, and hey it may be “better” but it’s still abuse."
"I'm thinking it's a nicer car than necessary. 

My very good friend is shit with money. She's paying $474 a month for a Mazda CX9 with some upgrades. She put down $3k plus the ""trade in value"" of her last car which was $1.2k. She's on the hook for a 7 year loan at $474 a month, or $44,016 total for a $32-35k car. The interest isn't too bad to be honest, but still.....that's a crapload of money."
"If you don't see this relationship lasting and he said that he never wants to live with a partner, why are you putting yourself through this stress? Why don't you just break up with him?"
"Your boyfriend has shown you that he has no respect for your time and has made it clear he isn't going to change for you. He doesn't care enough about you and your feelings/lack of time to change for you. Is that a dealbreaker for you?

The biggest issue I see here is that neither of you seem to be willing to set boundaries with your parents. He can't say no to his parents and unless you figure out a way to move out, it doesn't sound like you can say no to your parents. 

I don't understand why you can't do your homework on the day that you don't go out with your boyfriend tho...

Your boyfriend isn't going to change for you. Is his behavior a dealbreaker?"
"He is pushing your boundaries to see how much abuse you will tolerate. He says that it's just a 'joke' as plausible deniability.

Break up with him. This will get worse."
"10/10 reply!!

Op- Sorry girl. He’s not a great guy, even the worst most abusive men have periods of kindness. You deserve someone who will respect you as a person all the time. And not  still wrapped up in an ex. This kind of guy could get aggressive when you break up- do it over the phone and don’t see him again."
"I called him after my work shift, he just quickly went “i’m busy i can’t talk” after I explained myself. I told him to text me when he isn’t busy, he later did. He told me I was initiating a fight and that I send mixed signals. I told him that he shouldn’t be mixed up anymore because I would like to keep it now. He tried to get me to pay $180 as he paid for one game but it’s linked to his account which he will get back if he buys his own, and i’d lose so i told him i was paying only $100

He hasn’t responded to that, he quickly called after some texts and asked to meet up, i’ll see where it goes from there."
"If you haven't been able to help him realize this in 10 years, you never will. And you know why? Because your SO doesn't want to realize it. I mean, why would he? He manipulates and treats people poorly and yet he still has a partner and friends. Why on Earth would he change if he still gets exactly what he wants."
"Yes! I was with a guy for 4 years and he did this. Back then I didn’t realize it was abuse. He would bite me and wouldn’t let go, even when I started crying. I didn’t realize it was a power move. One time I was going on a trip and he kissed me goodbye then bit my cheek leaving a hickie for all to see. Disgusting. He thought it was hilarious and cute but in actuality he knew he was hurting me."
"Don’t give him the $100 back.. he got 8 months of use out of it when it was supposed to be “every now and then”

"Not all rape ruins a person psychologically forever. The only lasting mental affects I have from my sexual assault in college are fury at the guy who did it and a general desire to protect and help anyone else who has ever experienced sexual coersion. I wish that for you as well, truly. I think the reason I ended up okay is that I was able to take control of the narrative. I couldn't control him doing what he did, but I was in control afterward and made things go the way that I wanted. Which is why I recommend you taking control of this situation and not letting him lie to you about what happened and what this event meant to you. You get to have whatever reaction you want, on whatever timeline you want."
"I really wonder why he's so sure that he's going to get laid on a solo hiking trip. Did he sign up for, like, a gay singles camping weekend? Is he actually meeting someone there? Did he plan a trip to a popular cruising spot? 

All of this seems like a lot of prep (no pun intended) for something that he actually wants your input on. Signs point to him hooking up that weekend, whether you give him the go-ahead or not. I'd want to know a lot more."
It does if it means making your partner go hungry.
Its good etiquette to ask the host for permission to make such an announcement.
"I think there's a few ways to look at this, one he's trying to isolate you from your friends. The other is that he expects you to handle your daughter on your own, he doesn't want to do any parenting. Either way its a huge red flag like you said can definitely points to underlying issues. Either he can give you a good reason why he behaves like this or he's crazy."

-it seems like this is a pattern, and he views the two of y’alls kids as your kids, not his. 

-do y’all have separate money? Seems odd that all of your money goes to debt and daycare while his goes to trips. 

Honestly if I was you, I wouldn’t say a damn thing about his trip. Get a job, make your own money, he has to help with daycare. They are his children too. And then go where ever the hell you want. I don’t think he’s ever going to suddenly have the money for you to go anywhere, might as well just hustle and get it for yourself."
"&gt;Everything in her life has gone according to her plan. She is very fit, beautiful, confident, NOT-infertile (which is actually a huge struggle for me, as I have been rendered sterile, and wanted to have a big family), and basically has it all together. Everything about her is perfect.

no, that's impossible.
you said she is not-infertile, but you don't talk about her husband nor her children...
Did you talk to her about her life with her ? she have problems, she is human."
It's ok for him not having a penis to be a dealbreaker. Your friends are idiots.
"Why do you keep saying you won't decide about breaking up with her ""until everyone has played their cards""? What does that even mean?

Your girlfriend's friend crashed your date and sprayed you with your own pepper spray while your girlfriend stood around and refused to help you. There's really nothing left to know."
If anything you guys just needed to be more communicative about what you both expected. You did nothing wrong.
This is very diplomatic and I totally agree with you. He's looking out for Number 1.
"Sounds like she's experiencing some countertransferance that she's not keeping in check well. As the other commentators have said, some of her actions are entering the gray area of HIPAA violations.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion if a client is feeling a little uncertain as to whether a therapist has crossed a boundary, then the therapist has *completely* crossed a boundary (just given the amount of behind the scenes training they receive on disclosure/hipaa/countertransference that may not even register with a  client). I'd say you are welcome to discuss your discomfort with her (sometimes the therapeutic relationship can be strengthened from these types of discussions- but not always of course), but you would also be completely justified in seeking out a different therapist (I mean, you're never not-justified in seeking out a different therapist, but now you are extra justified). You might be justified in reporting her as well, but that's your call/I don't know the specifics of HIPAA well enough to know how that would unfold."
"Sit him down and make him read the emotional labor comic and ""She divorced me because I left the dishes by the sink"".

Tell him that your marriage is in serious jeopardy if he doesn't make some extremely big changes in his life.

Do not involve him at all with planning. Part of his journey of growing up is figuring out what needs to be done and just doing it."
"I’ve never understood why people are like this. I love rocking the boat for a good cause, and I don’t care about losing friendships for standing up for what’s right. That’s just always how it’s been for me. I wish I could understand how others are wired so opposite from this—social psychology, I suppose—and I wish that I could show them that it feels a lot more powerful to risk being ostracized than be complicit in something that causes people pain. It’s hard."
"OP: I'm having problems with my SO.

"I completely agree. When I was 9 if my mum had said to me, ‘We’re gonna donate £100 to charity,’ I’d have been like, ‘Wow that’s awesome!’ If she’d said, ‘We’re gonna donate £5,000’ honestly I think I’d have given the same response. As an adult £5k is a new car and £100 is a nice meal out - but 9 year olds have very little understanding of the value of money once it gets to ‘a lot’, so to them the difference is pretty minimal.

Plus what would they see from the donation? Pretty much nothing except being able to say, ‘We donated some money,’ which I don’t think a 9 year old would really get on the level an adult does. I love this idea because as you said, it actually teaches them the value of money and what an amount can actually buy. Even as an adult when I donate money I feel good but it kind of also feels like it just disappears - giving them a budget to buy items and donate physically lets them see the physical difference they’re making when they hand over needed items."

"My dads military so all his buddies have all hyped him up and the only other adult family member I have is my aunt and she doesn’t want to get involved because she thinks my dad is happy. 

His girlfriend is nice and treats me sort of like a friend, and if the circumstances were different I’d have no problem with her, but the relationship is weird and I can only see it ending badly."
"Now that your son is an adult you can set conditions for him living at home cost free, i.e. maintaining a reasonable curfew or good grades, she isn’t allowed over, etc. Failure to adhere results in you charging rent. 

He obviously wants to act like an independent adult so give him the independent adult treatment."
"&gt; eventually

And maybe not even that. My wife's mother is no better 20 years after wife moved out"
"&gt; I know he's not abusive

The fact that you've even felt compelled to write this tells us otherwise:  you know precisely who and what he is.

He will not stop.  He will continue to hurt you.  He will start to hurt you more severely, whining all the time that he's ""just having fun"" and ""he doesn't mean anything by it"" and why, oh why can't you ""have a sense of humor about it.""

He knows precisely what he is doing, and he is banking on you being so afraid of being single that you'll Stockholm Syndrome yourself into believing that everything is fine.

**Just because the abuse isn't ""as abusive"" as your last abusive relationship doesn't mean that it isn't abusive.**  Sure, he isn't punching you in the face or pushing you down the stairs, *but that doesn't make it any less physically abusive.*

He's ramping up, testing your boundaries.  Don't wait until he ""accidentally"" does something like ""playfully"" put his hands on your neck, or hold you down and tickle you until you scream in pain and panic.  

Break up with him.  *Please.*  If he has a key to your place, change your locks.  Do not break up with him in person:  **he will hurt you.  Badly.**  You break up with him over text.  Ideally, over at someone else's house so he can't find you for the next 48-72 hours.

You've left a violent relationship before.  You know how an abusive partner can wig the fuck out.

Go to Loveisrespect or thehotline and talk with someone about how to leave safely."
"If you need to, take your passport and leave China. Obviously you have a lot invested in your life in China, but preserving it isn’t worth enough to marry this guy. Your language skills will he useful in Taiwan, Singapore, and in Western countries that do business with China. Taiwan has a lot of respect for women’s rights (not quite up to western standards but still very good; the current president is a woman)."
so fuck him then?  He has no leverage on her - she should take it back and if he can't understand why and continues to gaslight her she should tell him to get fucked.
What the fuck? He asked you to pay MORE than he paid to use it? Its not your fault he bought a game to a system he doesnt own. Omg dump this trash AFTER you get the system back.
should? why? discuss what?
"&gt; If you just do embryos, then there is a chance all your kids can only be his. The harsh fact is that divorces and break ups happen.

I also wanted to mention, embryos can be considered marital property, whereas her eggs are hers alone.  If they get divorced she may not be allowed to use the embryos later if he doesn't allow it."

"So you’re in an open relationship but when your boyfriend called a woman beautiful you were “very hurt by this”.  

You’re boyfriend is not uncomfortable by this woman.  Most likely, he feels the way he wrote to her in those text messages.  It seems that you are the one uncomfortable by this and I don’t understand why."
"Yeah totally agreed, my biggest concern is that 32 year old doesn't understand this.  My other question is how long they've saved up to reach the $5,000.  If they've been saving up for a couple years, and the kids/wife want to blow it all been donating to a homeless shelter to avoid teaching them that:

&gt; That having fun is more important than helping people less fortunate? 


I feel sorry for the husband.  Being called selfish because he wants to take his 2 daughters to disney instead of donating it to a homeless shelter, and then being accused of wanting to go to disney for selfish reasons because he likes disney stuff.  This might be sort of harsh, but OP sounds like an idiot."
"Most big guys are very aware they could unintentionally hurt someone, and try not to... Especially with a woman. *Especially* their girlfriend. 

So what does it say about this guy that he doesn't even try to stop, even after you said it bothers you? It says to me that he enjoys hurting you."
My parents wouldn't help me even if I wanted them to. They love him and it's kind of scary to tell them when we break up because I know they will guilt me and make me feel bad over it.
"1.) You are not missing on familly you wanted. This familly is abusive and willing to lie. Close contact with them would mean that they will lie to you, lie about you, bully you as they are now. Lies and disregard for you are pattern of behavior as of now. That would not change.

2.) I don't want this to sound too bad, but nephews and nieces are not missing you. They don't have relationship to you in the first place and they live their lives normally. They live in familly which means they are not starved for relationship as you were.

3.) Previous point notwhistanding, if nieces and nephews suffer it is because their parents and other familly seem to be sort of sociopaths. Somehow I don't believe these people are loving model parents. Their kids are being manipulated a lot. You can't help them tho.

4.) You have own family and hopefully own friends. Focuse on them. Build your life and your sons life."
"Girl, you are 29 dating a 23-year old with the attitude of a teenager. Do yourself a favour and find a man with the emotional age of an adult."
"OP doesn’t have parents in her life, she says she and her sister were in foster care. Which makes this guy even more of a scumbag, because it’s not like Sister has close family besides OP.

If you don't have friends or extended relatives who can help, call your brother-in-law and say “I’m so sorry to add to your troubles, but my fiancé turned violent when I asked for help to make it to the funeral. I’m leaving him of course, and I’m going to come over any way I can.”

Your BIL is likely aware of how much his wife needs you right now, so he may be able to make things happen (loan you the money, ask his own parents, etc)."
"&gt; she is going to sell the IPad for twice as much to get the money to pay us back.

This is lunacy. 

Frankly, if your wife hasn’t learned not to give her mother money by now, she never will. She’s been burned badly and *repeatedly* by this woman and refuses to change her boundaries as a result. And now it’s affecting not just you, but your child as well. 

I don’t have much hope for your marriage here. You can try couples counseling, but I suspect this is going to end up in a lawyer’s office. Unless your wife does a major about-face regarding her family and finances, you’re never going to be able to trust her to put your marriage and child first."
"Let it happen. There's a point at which someone needs to reap the consequences for their behavior and this one is ripe for the reckoning.

This is necessary. While your uncle might have done well by it, few businesses flourish by carrying so much dead weight. If your brother can't care enough to even make the pretense of working for his pay, he should be gone. Hopefully that would be the wake up call he needs, but it seems doubtful. Coming into adulthood with the idea he can ride easy on the work of others, he really needs that mentality knocked out of him sooner rather than later."
"So on top of making a hasty decision, moving to a hot place in hot weather which makes it difficult to explore, she is at least a little racist.

Ouch. She is going to have a hard time adjusting.

I agree with changing the code to your house. How old is she? She should be looking for work as well. Did she get any funds for the sale of her house? Is that what she is living off of? 

I'm a single mom (or was for most of my son's life) and would never expect him to do what your husband is doing for her. It is great that you two want to set up this life for her, but she will still need to make friends, find hobbies and activities, and not expect you two to be her only people that she hangs out with.

I can understand her wanting you guys to go with her shopping and such, but it needs to be planned. I also recommend perhaps having a weekly dinner, so she knows that she is welcome and you aren't dropping her but can't spend all your time with her. And then you can mentally prepare for entertaining.

Good luck. Sounds like it is going to be hard for everyone. The sooner she finds a job the easier I think it will be."
"They want to go on vacation with their almost adult daughter, and they know she will enjoy it way more when you're along and you two can hang out and do active young people things. It's probably true that their daughter will be a bit bored hanging out with her parents all day for a week. Also, they must enjoy your company. Just go. Make sure you bring suitable clothes, and be respectful and easy to be with while you're there. You'll probably have a great time."
Or don’t let him crash because he’s not a good friend.
"&gt;its better that suffering be ""my mommy embarrassed me"" than ""I couldn't get into a good college because I was too busy with a MILF who dropped me for a younger piece 3 years later, after I stuck around in my hometown for her and killed my relationship with my family.""

I really agree with this."
"After seven years, you two should count as a single invitation. It being a ""small group"" on the first day does NOT justify uninviting your girlfriend of seven fucking years to ANYTHING. He should feel guilty. He did a really shitty thing to you and he should be doing his best to make it up to you, not shoving in your face how much fun he had."
"You tell her that you aren't willing to remove your mother from your life and if that means she won't marry you, that's a choice she has to make.   She's ""borrowing trouble"" that doesn't yet actually exist.  She *thinks* this will be a problem, she doesn't know it will be and she's not even willing to wait and see if it will be.  Now, the person I would actually suspect in this is your step-mother and her friend (I presume the girls mother or aunt or whomever) for possibly putting this into her head, but there's only one way to handle it.  

You tell her you aren't removing your mother from your life so she needs to decide if she's willing to marry you."
"If you listen to any of these replies listen to this person. You deserve more. As a guy I am completely astounded why females stay in relationships for so long with these types of guys. You deserve better, way better."
"You're the real MVP. That post history is solid gold: from the millionaire brother, hate speech, down to the still texting theit ex in naughty ways."
The fact that you're still hung up on him is the exact reason you should not go see him. Cancel the trip.
"I work with children everyday. I know the effects this has on a young child. By ignoring it you have become a part of the problem. I get it. You don’t want to rock the boat. You don’t want him not to talk to you. Is any of that an excuse to sit by while this child, your niece, suffers? I’m sorry OP but I don’t believe you should be doing any favors for your brother until he gets it together. Also, if he is mistreating her you need to inform her mother. Being treated this way as a child can impact her entire life."
"Tbh I think you sound really immature. You had this ""fantasy"" of him being this invulnerable Superman and he gets hurt and now you're complaining he ""burst your bubble""? By doing what exactly? Being a normal human being? 

The way you keep going on about how big and strong he is sounds really bizarre, that's how a 16 year old girl would think.

It doesn't sound like you like this guy because of who he is, you're just caught up in fanstasyland about tarzan and jane shit. I think you should sort yourself out before stringing him along, and learn how to see people as real human beings, not props for your sexual fantasies."
"Please for the love of God listen to these people. I was you and my dumbass did it twice with 2 different guys. The second time around I went the adoption route and got my tubes tied. Im only 22 years old and I cant have anymore kids. The second time I regretted so bad telling him and not just getting an abortion. He was so happy even though neither of us were ready to take on extra responsibility. Our relationship didnt even last less than half of the pregnancy but it was too late. But I ignored the signs. The first guy same situation I regretted telling him, though I still have custody and I am happy I kept my daughter I am still young and feel so much pressure of parenthood. Please if you are not ready to be a single mother I would suggest you get an abortion while its early. It seems like you have a good head on your shoulders to recognize the red flags. No guy who has to ask his girlfriend to pay bills for a place she doesnt live has no place having a child. I did this for both guys and the last time I got any sort of support was 2 months ago and it was only $25 and in the 2 years weve been broken up that was the second time ive gotten money. Just please read the signs for what they are, a warning. Its not too late for you. Sending love"
I feel like that’s even more of a reason for you to go!
"Would either of you be open to changing neighbourhoods within your city? I'm about your age and also an introvert, and my career means that I need to live in a big city (Toronto) and while I loved it when I was younger (so much to do!) in the last year or so I found myself getting tired/frustrated with always being around people, the traffic, the busyness, etc. 

But I hate commuting so I also couldn't even seriously look at a more rural suburb. And then last Spring I discovered a whole new neighbourhood that's exactly the feel I was looking for, it reminds me a lot of the small town I grew up in. 

It's not a cool or hip neighbourhood - it's a little more ""mature"", lots of young families and older retirees, there's no trendy restaurants - but there's lots of parks and nature nearby, all I see out of my apartment window is trees, bike trails, not a lot of chain stores, small mom and pop businesses. I had no idea that this sort of feeling could exist in the city, but it's been life-changing. There's a real community here, I've met so many people and I can't even go into the cafe down the street without bumping into someone (which I *love* some days, but sometimes it's not my favourite). 

And the best part is that it's a 9km bike ride to work (30 min) in the heart of downtown. I really feel like I'm getting the best of all worlds. Does your city have any sort of neighbourhoods like that (you might have to do research)? Would you be open to that level of compromise? Would he be open to it? 

Otherwise - if you can't agree on where to live, it's going to make at least one of you miserable. Being miserable indefinitely, especially about something as fundamental as your *home*, is a hard thing for a relationship to come back from."
"And also because of the inherent power imbalance between men and women. It sounds like she's not in any danger here, but it's self-protective behavior for women to soften interactions that may feel like rejection to men- we never know when they may react with anger or violence, and blunting the knife is a way to protect ourselves from potential danger.   


Also, she gives that reason in her original post: "" I've had guys try to completely destroy my life socially after being rejected in a way that upset them to much, so the unfortunate fact is I have to avoid them getting butthurt in this particular situation."""
"Aside from the fact that he's taking money that's not his, which is a whole relationship issue in itself, stop putting money in that account with his name on it. Open your own savings account in your name only and start putting the money there."
"You don't need your parents permission to call the police, or a psychiatric hospital.  It's clear and obvious that your parents are not properly equipped to deal with your brother.  And unfortunately, it sounds like just a matter of time before he seriously harms you, or worse.  Take matters into your own hands if you have to."
"He called it an 'invisible set of rules', but you've tried to specifically tell him what you want him to do and he still doesn't do it. 

You could both sit down and make a list of things each of you will do. Then it's not 'invisible rules' or 'impossible standards' because you've agreed on the list before hand.

But also, I totally agree with all the comments about mental load, and your boyfriend just sounds lazy and immature and is taking advantage of the fact that he knows if he doesn't do it you will. So, if you make this list, you have to not cover for him off he doesn't do it. Just remind him, no matter how annoyed he seems - he agreed remember!"
"I would never have anything to do with my mother if she, a grown woman, left my dad for an 18 year old. That is disgusting. You'll have to do what's right for you though I suppose."
"&gt;What do I say when he gets home?

If divorce is his solution to *his* financial irresponsibility, you need to do some very deep thinking about the viability of your marriage over the long term.   Money has always been an issue between you and he's saying that as far as he's concerned, it's his way or the highway

You should probably explore your options here, including couples counseling and a lawyer."
"So along these lines, OP... I'm 45F, and I'm going to hazard a guess that what's baffling you isn't *really* how to handle this, because it's really pretty straightforward.  What's baffling you is how to get your Switch back *and* keep things happy between you and your boyfriend. The answer is, you don't. 

You assert your clear right, and be prepared for him to show himself to be the petulant manipulative sponge you have already described.  And then you call him on that too. 

He might have a burst of self-awareness and snap out of it, but most likely not. Then you get to decide if this is a trait you can or want to live with. 

If you decide you want to stay with him, you now know that you can expect him to use this behavior every time he wants something that you don't want to give.  

Do you want peace at any price? If you do, get ready for the victim ploy when you disagree about gifts, vacations, what car to buy, where to live, whether to get married, whether to have kids (if that's something you want), and on and on. 

I hope for your sake that you find yourself willing to brave the sadness and loneliness of a breakup rather allowing yourself to be taken advantage of this way. Because this is merely a sneak preview of what life with this guy will be like."
"What a frustrating situation to be in. I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this. 

From what you’ve shared, it sounds like you’ve been clear about your wants and needs regarding your timeline and reasons for marriage, but he hasn’t met you even close to half way. You moved your timeline out and have made compromises, but other than his agreeing to have a few discussions and then just letting it fall by the wayside, he’s been unreceptive. At this point, I think you know deep down that this isn’t working and I do think you’ll resent him if you stay together.

That said, moving on doesn’t mean you have to give up on the idea of marriage and/or children. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being single either, or even deciding to become a mother on your own if you choose. There are so many different ways to live your life, and they don’t have to include dragging along an unwilling participant like your boyfriend.

You know what you want for your life, and this is not it. Yes, things might look good on paper as far as how you two match up, your families, etc, but that is not the same as your goals. And it’s no fun to harangue someone into marriage either—that rarely works out well for anyone. For whatever reason, your boyfriend isn’t ready, but you are so it’s time to decide whether you’ve had enough and start working toward the future you want, regardless of how much he cries or your families disapprove, or whatever else tugs at your heartstrings. Imagine how things could be in six months, a year, two years from now if you start today, and then begin that journey."

You should play the nicest you've ever played. Don't put it in text or writing though. Get him comfortable and quietly secure a divorce attorney. You need to follow their guidance to the letter.

A parent like him will fuck your kids up over the years. You are going to need to see that they get their own therapists and maybe go to family therapy with them for a good while during / after the divorce."
"This dude sucks real hard, and it sounds like you know it.

"&gt; I just wish I could help him realize that what he does hurts others around him.

**HE DOES NOT CARE,**

If he cared he would change.  People are simple like that.

My question:  What are you avoiding about your own life?  What do you think you will fix about yourself by ""fixing"" him?

I will guess that having him as a bf is a substitute for self-esteem?  That having a decades-long project of ""fixing"" a ""broken"" man is a way to prove to yourself and the world that you have value?

**Why aren't you expending the same energy and care on yourself, OP?  Why don't you think you have value?**

A man is not a project.

He is a fully-formed autonomous individual.  **He will not change.**  You have to take him as he is right now.

My suggestions:

* Therapy.  You need to heal what is broken within you.  You need to begin fighting back against the way *he* is working to change *you.*  And he is, you know, changing you.  That's the trick of toxic relationships:  the victim believes that she has all the control and is making some headway in changing her man into ""the guy she knows he can be,"" *but she's the only one changing as contorts herself to justify his toxicity.*

* If money is an issue, go to Captain Awkward and search for ""low cost mental health.""  Stay and read through her archives:  she has much wise and compassionate advice.

* Go to loveisrespect and take the quiz.  Be honest.  How did you score?

* Look up the following terms:  cycle of abuse; gaslighting; lovebombing; trauma bonding; Issendai sick systems.  How many sound really familiar?

* Read ""It's time to make emotional abuse a crime"" by Lauren Laverne.  I bet the box analogy will hit home.

* Read *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft.  **Do not have a copy anywhere your bf can find it:  He will make you pay a terrible price.**

* Gather up Team You.  You need support as you begin to process the truth of your situation.  You need to do fun things and be distracted.

* Double down on your social life without bf.  You need a reminder that you are capable of negotiating the world on your own.

I obviously want you to leave him, but you don't sound anywhere near ready, so start with therapy.  Please, OP, the only person who can rescue you here is you."
Because your husband is a cokehead?!
"To be clear, we mean ""leave him because he won't change."" NOT, ""You can't expect him to do better so you have to just deal with his abusive behavior."""
Albert is a fuckin snake. He had no reason to tell the coworker about OP’s message other than to stir the pot.
"Some people are okay with porn in a relationship and some people aren't. He won't admit fault because he is okay with it. That doesn't mean you have to be okay with it. You have to determine if this is a deal breaker for you and walk away from the relationship if it is. Neither party is wrong here, but this does present an incompatibility. Proceed accordingly."
Nicely said. Op's mom should work down this response.
"You sound more disdainful of her life, not envious. I also think you're being incredibly harsh on her while cutting yourself a mile of slack. I don't think you should be harder on yourself, but I do think you could stand to cut her a little more slack. 

You suffer from mental health issues which are largely ""invisible"" to people. Don't think that just because you can't see what she's struggling with that she's not struggling sometimes. 

You are so focused on how your life could be that you're not actually living your life. You're watching for moments to be jealous and you seem to feel superior because you feel you've suffered more in life. That's pretty elitist tbh. The only way to stop feeling this way is to stop excusing yourself from feeling this way."
Throw a huge big divorce party. That will let everyone know you aren’t the married guy anymore and will hopefully kickstart a more active social life for you.
"3 months***. His apartment is 600$ a month and its a one bedroom with a tiny living room and a kitchen area in it. He says he needs to be compensated. It pisses me off. I wanna let it go but its unfair. And I know how « diva » he acts once he’s upset too, I don’t need that tonight. I just told him I let him crash 3 months last year for free , no replies. Left on read. Sigh."
"There's a lot of room between 'stay stuck forever' and 'get divorced'.  

I think the first thing you should do is have a conversation.  Find a time when neither of you has anything else going on, and sit him down.  Tell him you need to have a serious (not bad, but serious) conversation for 20 minutes and ask if you can have his full attention (no phones etc).  Get him to agree.  This is the first step because if he promises you his undivided attention, it's harder for him to run away from the discussion.  

Tell him you love him very much, you love being married to him, you love waking up next to him, and you are lucky to have him.  Then tell him that while you love him and the relationship very much, you are not happy.  And you are not happy because you don't want to live your whole life in your home town.  Moving to the city was, and is, one of your life goals.  You thought it was one he shared, or at least was on board with- that's what you and him agreed before you married.  But now you are not happy because you're in your 30s, and if you don't move to the city soon you probably never will.  And the idea of living your whole life in your hometown and never going anywhere, that's something you don't want, never wanted, and the idea that it's happening right now is making you depressed.  Tell him every day you dream about just packing your car and going, but you stay because you love him.  

Then tell him that you don't want HIM to be as unhappy as you are.  You don't want to force him to do something he doesn't want to do.  But before you and him married he agreed to move to the city, and so far nothing has happened and he has resisted every attempt to move, so you feel like he is not keeping his promise.  

Tell him if he really really does not ever want to move, and won't even consider it, he should say so.  If that's the case you will probably leave and that is the best option- if you don't leave, you will just grow to resent him for keeping you where you don't want to be, and that will poison the marriage slowly but surely.  But if he is willing to at least try or consider it, you want to at least try city life together.  

One thing you can suggest- maybe even as a starter before this big conversation- go on a mini vacation to the city.  Like get a hotel room for a week (you say you have money...) and live the city life for a while.  Maybe that will show him it's not so bad."
"I would just call without the warning.

It doesn't have to be actually siccing the cops on him, just establishing this paper trail and the pattern of harassment."
"Wait, you knew that her mom ruined her credit and yet you loaned her a large amount of money? Also, ipads don't cost $1,000- you can buy a pretty new one for $250. Yes, you should confront both of them together and say that things are extremely tight financially and you cannot continue to front her money when she owes you such a large amount."
"Agree with this. All these people are saying to give him the money back but he’s gotten his share. It was always hers, it wasn’t like they were going to have some sort of visitation agreement if they broke up!"
"100% this comment.

&gt; I am really uncomfortable carrying this secret.

You don't really get to choose what secrets you carry, and you should almost never tell a secret that isn't yours to tell."
"That's an excuse and is probably why he's getting snappy with you.  It was nearly two decades ago.  if you are not over it, which you clearly are not, you NEED therapy."
"Dude, you need to cut this woman off. She sounds unstable and honestly, sorta dangerous. Go no contact and stay away."
"&gt;On multiple occasions he has asked me not to message or contact his friends unless he is present. He says he is old fashioned.

This is scary and controlling. He is not ""old fashioned"" he is a controlling ass and the more info you reveal, the more abusive he seems."
"""As per my last email..."""
"You’re not in a mental fog, but if you are, let me clear it up for you. 

You want to fuck your ex. He wants to fuck you and keep seeing his new girlfriend. Your choices are to either do the thing that’s morally wrong that fulfills your desire (go fuck the ex), or realize he has a new gf and not stay with him, this l acing you in the moral clear, but also no sex.

You are in a “fog” because you want to fuck this guy AND still think of yourself as a good person when you do it. Sorry, that’s not an option.


So fuck him and feel a bit guilty, or don’t fuck him but don’t feel guilty. That’s your choices. Choose one."
"You did the right thing. 50% of a relationship is intimacy, sex. I don’t care how much I love a guy, if he’s not having sex with me I’m gone."
"Yup. 

But.

I am worried you are going to jump straight in to this next relationship and become who they want you to be. 

You need to spend some time figuring out who you are, without another partner influencing you."
"This is a tricky issue. I don't think I would tell the partner either if a friend of mine was cheating, unless the partner is an equally good friend of mine. That doesn't mean I think cheating is acceptable: I think it's wrong! But I wouldn't betray my friend because of it. I'd try to convince them to come clean to their partner, I would get mad at them even. I would tell them what I think about their behaviour, even if it means they stop talking to me. So it's not about losing them as a friend, it's about not betraying their trust. My loyalty lies with my friend first (unless we're talking about like a serious crime or something).

Now with racism and homophobia, I've never had a friend like that and I find it hard to imagine myself developing a friendship with someone like that in the first place. But my boyfriend does have friends with sexist attitudes. I know for a fact that he doesn't hold those views in the slightest, and he even comments negatively on the things these guys do, expressing his reject for those attitudes. But he doesn't stop hanging out with them. I used to be bothered by it, and it still bothers me a little, but I've learned that he also thinks like this:

&gt; he doesn't hold his friends to the same standards he applies to himself or me 

He has certain standards that he applies to himself, and to the person he's going to share his life with, but he doesn't feel it's necessary to apply them to some guy he just watches football with a couple of times a month.

So, I don't think your boyfriend necessarily believes cheating is acceptable. He might be like me, and prioritize his loyalty to his friends. Or he might just be a non-confrontational person who doesn't feel it's any of his business. I would focus on how he actually acts and behaves in his day to day life."
"The second you say ""yeah my parents abandoned me and now they're trying to take credit for my success..."" no one is going to think you're horrible or bitter. They'll think your parents are"
"OP has said that men have tried to ruin her socially after being confronted, which can be extra difficult to recover from as someone with a social disorder, so it's understandable to me that she doesn't want to be confrontational."
"I had an ex-partner who did this to me too; i had gone for a drive to calm down after an argument we had. I ended up having to sleep in my car as he locked me out. He also threw all of my things out of the bedroom window. The argument was the culmination of 4 years of gaslighting and emotional abuse. His level of toxic narcisism was beyond repair.
I think the fact that the place was 'his' house and he was older than me had something to do with his behaviour. He enjoyed watching me beg to come back in, knowing full well that i had no friends and family within a 90 mile radius.

I found out not long after that he had been cheating on me whilst working away Mon-Thurs. Needless to say things finished there and im so glad i made the decision. I pity him.

If this isnt the first time something like this has happened, just end it now and save wasting anymore time with this guy."
"Also wanted to add the guy says he's on the fence about wanting kids to continue to be in the relationship with OP. most people know if they want kids or not. 

whatever aside. OP your hurt. it doesn't matter how insignificant that thing is, the way he exploded on you ... WOW. you don't want a life with someone like that.

i don't think this is a one-off incident in a 2-year relationship :|"
"She already dumped at least one boyfriend to keep him around. 

Stop wasting your time with someone who is involved with someone else like that, you won’t get what you want out of the relationship.

Unless you just want to be casual with her and not be BF/GF, just people who date sometimes. Then just accept it and go out with her when you feel like it. Don’t get too attached."
"Just keep reassuring her that you love her and chose to be with her. 

I understand how she feels. There's a mutual friend that my fiance has always had a crush on, and I 100%  know if she and I had both been single at the same time, he never would have looked twice at me. So yeah, sometimes that insecurity creeps in and I can't help feeling like he settled for me as a ""best I can do,"" kind of option. Like he couldn't get the girl he really wanted, so he decided I was better than nothing. 

Again, just keep reassuring her. Tell her all the things she does that you love. That always works to reassure me whenever I talk to my fiance about my insecurities...he reminds me of our inside jokes, of the things I do that he thinks are really cute, the things I do that make him laugh, etc. 

Tell her that you are dating her because you like the person she is. That if you didn't want to be with her, you wouldn't have asked her out. 
."
"Why should you accept that behavior at all, let alone bitterly? He threw an absolute tantrum. He’s a grown adult. Throwing temper tantrums and manipulation tactics around like candy at a parade."
"This is a very naive relationship. You cannot know if you want to marry someone if you just see them every now and then like that.
You do not listen to her or take into account how she feels at all. She did not want to get a proposal, but you did it. She does not want to move, but you still expect her to. She has birthday coming up, and you get so caught up in your feelings you dont consider hers at all.

I think you might be the problem here. You need to start listening. A life together is for both of you, not just you."
Not a relationship worth saving if they can’t communicate properly what’s upset them. Even if you fixed it you run the risk of it just happening again.
I think you might be right.
"Sorry, but as a thirty year old, i’m going to urge you to stop seeking rationalization for this. There isn’t a legitimate reason for an adult independent man to hide a friendship from you. 

When people say “i didn’t tell you because you’d be upset” it almost always means they knew they were behaving in the wrong. You being upset would have been completely justified. 

I don’t care what people say about this subreddit: Your Bf is acting like a waste of your time. I don’t think you should be with someone who thinks like he does and displays zero integrity, loyalty or compassion to you. 

The entire point of dating is to figure out how to have a healthy relationship, and who you can have that with. This is not what a healthy relationship should ever be like."
"Then I wish you luck.

Because basing a relationship on what you hope someone with eventually become is often an express ticket to misery, and your initial post already shows you're well on your way to being there."
"Your close friends don't expect you to be a package deal with your significant other of 7 years when you go to events? Your SO of 7+ years doesn't get to participate in ""close friend only"" events? Really?"
Go over. Put 100 dollars down in cash and take your Switch
This is...a really childish way to approach a relationship. Girlfriend needs to own her choices and steel herself for hard conversations when she fucks up. It’s the dishonesty and cowardice that’ll tank your marriage in the end.
I would say once he was threatening her with a lethal weapon it already crossed that line.
"I'm hesitant to use the word ""rape"" but technically it was...I don't feel any trauma from it, but after processing it a little more throughout the day, it's becoming more and more unsettling. I feel like I'm trying to justify it in my head, (we had sex earlier in the night), but I know that does not excuse what he did at all. I just feel so weird about it. I actually am an advocate for survivors of sexual assault, and so I have heard this story happen so many times. I really wish I would have said something to him this morning. Thank you for your thoughtful response."
"This is a really big thing to be thankful for.  I know way too many people (men and women) who got married in hetero relationships and put themselves, their spouses, and their children through hell.  Fuck that."
"Talk to your younger brother. He didn't make a mistake. He asked out someone he was interested in. She gave a reason why she wasn't interested. Everyone was open and polite, he didn't make a faux pas. Maybe talk to him about expectations and that this one early experience shouldn't mark future attempts, but also not to get emotionally invested so much this early on. 

Your other brothers sound incredibly immature and it's not really an achievement that they have a new girl every few months. That just seems that there are lot of women who they are incompatible with. They can't really teach your younger brother much either."
"100% a manipulator. Op is being super great in his responses if it were a normal insecure person, but this woman is clearly trying to isolate him from his friends."
"&gt; he's always laughing like a kid while doing this.

Sure.  He's having fun, so he laughs.  Sort of how someone who likes torturing animals laughs at their pain."
"&gt; Now I feel kind of stupid. She probably thinks I told him to tell her, ""hey, your sister can't hang out with your ex,"" or something.

She almost certainly thinks this because it's exactly what Jim said to her.    I think the best thing to do is to leave her alone.  It's up to Jim to repair the relationship if he wants to.  If he does though, he needs to fix the drama he caused when he threw you under the bus."
"god the top-voted responses to this is so weird; it's obvious that OP's husband has a crush on this woman and has absolutely been shit at establishing boundaries, to the point that you could argue this is in the realm of emotional cheating. they were already hugging at work (aka intimate physical contact), which might seem innocent until you consider the fact that he felt the need to stop because he felt it was crossing boundaries and ""other people are looking"" (aka coworkers).

OP i think your instincts are correct. your husband is dancing a line here and he failed to put your marriage first. instead of letting her go he's just letting her dangle on the line without reeling her in. he didn't draw a clear line in the sand (i.e. ""i'm just not interested, sorry"") because he wants to keep her as backup."
I would dump someone who was openingly let his friends mock me
"One thing to consider here: if he really cared that it bothered you, wouldn't he have stopped by now?"
"I promise I'm not mom shaming as I have a 7 month old, but I think if you implemented some sleep training, everyone would sleep better and be happier. 10 months is old enough to just about be sleeping through the night. I'm not saying you have to subscribe to cry it out or anything, but maybe look at some alternative strategies. That being said, I don't think it's unreasonable to have your hubby let you sleep in every other Sunday. Momming is hard."
"That mixed group gathering is a grown up way of dealing with this.

I totally agree with you that this is not weird at all. I think the OP is overdoing it on the entitlement if she thinks she should be invited to group events where she only knows one other person. Imagine if you had to invite everyone you knew to everything you did. That would be exhausting.

I get the sense that OP is scorekeeping on her relationships and is still expecting Megan to repay her for ""gifting"" her new friends."
"Counselors don't make money off of medication either, so they're telling you because they genuinely think it would help you. They just can't be the ones to actually prescribe it because it's not part of their license so they're referring you to someone who can. Medication and therapy together may be extremely beneficial to help you get coping skills that may reduce your panic attacks. Take care of yourself first, always."
"How long ago is ""many"" years ago?"
"...to separate you from people who might support you. 

The more support you have from people who aren’t your boyfriend, the stronger and more independent you are. A strong support network makes it easier for people to walk away from relationships that no longer make them happy or in which they’re treated poorly. Their friends/family remind them of their worth and provide a softer landing if they choose to leave. If your support network is weakened and you’re cut off from people who lift you up, it’s easier for a partner to drag you down. And a partner who knows they treat you badly needs you weakened to make sure you stick around. At that point they won’t have to worry about earning your love and respect through kindness and support anymore - you’ll stay because you don’t feel like you have a choice."
Changing the locks may not be a bad idea either. Who knows if she copied a key while they were canping.
"Contractor here.

&amp;#x200B;

My guess, he's doing a bigger commercial job in a mall. To get to the place he usually parks, he has to walk through the perfume section of some department store.

&amp;#x200B;

Source: Wife accused me of cheating a year or two ago because I reeked of perfume, I had no idea what she was on, the next day at work told my colleague about it, he said it's because we walked through some perfume store to get to our parking, making our clothes reek of perfume."

"Post in /legaladvice. It might be that CPS has to be involved and that your mother legally should be taking charge. Unclear if this happened, sounds like sister just dumped the kids at grandma and then your mom showed up. There could also then be help available in the form of counseling, as it sounds like the kids flew under the abuse/neglect radar for a long time. These kids need a bit more help than just a loving relative. There's also the long term planning: your mom intends to return the kids to your sister, but there is a lot of question about your sister's ability to parent. It's unfair to promise these kids her home, if she never can achieve a safe place for them."
"I’d say just confront him about it, just so you’d hear his side.... but Ya it sounds like he has a thing for the girl.... sorry. 

Look texts like that wouldn’t be a huge deal alone, but if he’s lying about it that’s a big red flag, cause it means he didn’t want you to know. The second red flag would be that he just never mentioned you to her, and in her defense it doesn’t seem like you she knew you two were in a relationship. But if they’re talking everyday.... just you’d think “I’m engaged” would have occurred in some form. And as for the third flag just his reaction when he learned you told her.... it shouldn’t be a big deal, unless of course he doesn’t want to scare her off.

Really sorry you’re going through this. But I really think you two are overdue for s talk on your relationship"
"Most people refuse to do this because they're too preoccupied with telling everyone how crazy their new ex was and painting themselves the victim.

That's why I think it's a massive positive she was able to have this epiphany.  A lot of people wouldn't have bothered with the self-examination it takes to realize that yes, you didn't bother trying because you thought your SO would call your bluff."
"Wow this sucks OP. I’m sorry you’re agonizing over his one $80 game when he’s obviously not fussed at all that you’ve put a lot more money into the Switch, plus 5 games. The game system is yours. Either he can grow up, get over it and apologize, or you two can break up. At least if it comes to that you’ll have your Switch at home."
"Yeah, considering he said ""apparently"" regarding what she said about her prior BC experiences he probably needs to be a bit more supportive.  


Yes, condoms are ""terrible"" but honestly look into them. There are lots of variety out there that improve the sensations for everyone so it isn't really that good an excuse. As noted by others here, hormonal BC can really mess with one's head and often it isn't worth the trade-off. Look into other BC methods and, really, accept that condoms have to be an option on the table."
"Omg, no I am absolutely not thinking “Be patient, he has a lot on his plate right now” I’m thinking being decent 90% of the time does not mitigate the 10% of the time when he is absolutely and without question emotionally abusing you. This is abuse, OP. It’s up to you to decide if you want to accept being abused, or tell him that he either gets help or you leave. And then actually leave if he refuses, because again, HE IS ABUSING YOU."
"That is not her being a “worrywart”, that is her being flat out rude.  Your boyfriend should talk to his mother about this, you shouldn’t have to deal with that."

"Love and attraction are two very separate things. Just like you can be attracted to people you don't love or even like, you can love people you're not attracted to. And frankly anyone who thinks love should outweigh or override attraction is being naive. My (ex) boyfriend of 5 years was sincerely shocked when I told him that him getting a split-tongue body modification would impact my attraction to him. 

Some people are into butch or masculine girls. You're not one of them, and that's fine. You're allowed to be attracted to girly girls without feeling guilty or without anyone shaming you for it. You say you don't want to break up, but a relationship without attraction isn't really a relationship, it's a friendship. Both you and your partner deserve to be with people you are attracted and/or attractive to."
"Several times, but he always shrugs me off and pushes me away from the topic: ""Mom I'm too tired, Mom I've gotta study, Mom I've gotta go out see you at 8"". When he is available to talk, either his friends are here or she is.

He's not always been this way, I just know her better than he does, she's not a good influence on him, he'll stop everything at the drop of the hat for her, but when I want to talk to him as his mother he doesn't see the importance of it and it's very upsetting."
Have you tried using toys in her instead or encouraging mutual masturbation? There are many other ways to have sex or get off besides vaginal intercourse. It can be awkward and out of the comfort zone at first but the climax and the bond can be incredible.
"You have to consider that right now, he is a man who would rather reduce his wife to tears over breakfast than go to therapy.

It is *possible* he'll change, but you have to ask yourself how long you'll wait for him.

It sounds like thibgs have already reached a point that most fairly healthy people would have gone ""fuck, what have I done I have to do what it takes to change""

And instead hes... Not.

You should consider reading ""Why does he do that"" and check out the ""love is respect"" website.

Its not uncommon for a person to show their true colors after marriage. I'm afraid these are his."
Minimum wage is $7.25 but because I'm a waitress I only make $2.15/hr. I *should* be tipped well enough to make up that difference but people don't tip very well to a half-Latina when you live in racist bumfuck nowhere.
"It doesn't justify his actions at all. He spent 5 years being able to hold it in, surely a couple of hours wouldn't have made much of a difference. Doing that to someone while they're at work is just cruel and there's no way a 35 year old wouldn't know that. 

Why even say he needed to tell her something, knowing she'd want to know? After 5 years he should have had the respect to tell her in the appropriate setting. Says a lot about his character though and ultimately she's so much better off out of it all."
It really sounds like you don't have much respect for this guy.  There's no point really asking if he deserves your respect or not-- bottom line is that he doesn't have it.  So why bother continuing to be with him?
"I have an unusually large amount of experience with Narcissism(NPD). The truth of the matter is that your BIL, if he is in fact a narc has absolutely no idea that his behavior has any effect on anyone else. As crazy as it seems he can only see his own needs regardless of how consequential they are upon others. Ruining you, his bro, your wedding, your relationship is no problem whatsoever. All he can see is how you are not helping him get what he wants. He will utilize anyone or any method to regain his supply.  Also, they are usually raised or affected by a Narc at some point in their lives.. look for that as well. 

You see, the narc if fundamentally broken inside so therefore they use people to fulfill their need for adulation and bolstering of their false self. They ideally find people they can control, then keep them down and manipulate them into believing that they will never find anyone else that’s better. This keeps the supply steadily filling them. This goes on and on because the Narc doesn’t have any boundaries when it comes to keeping their supply. There is no abuse that they will not employ to keep the supply coming. Most of the abuse is mental because physical is often more easily identifiable and can implicate them as an abuser. 

When the person being abused finally, after many attempts, leaves the Narc all hell breaks loose. Typical the Narc will first more to destroy the character of person leaving. It is likely vicious and brutal. The lies, deformation and manipulation of truth to make people believe it is the fault of the person leaving is the vehicle of punishment most often utilized. They cannot, will not, allow themselves to be see at fault and will execute any form of character assassination to destroy it. 

If you really believe your BIL is a Narc do some serious research and fully learn about what you’re actually dealing with. This may sound a bit extreme but you need to know your enemy and employ a disciplined strategy to remove yourself from it.  Typically the Narc is a very smart and calculating person. If you don’t buy in to his shit there is a strong chance he will look for opportunities to make you look bad to his family and cause doubt about you within his brother. These people are as fucked up as you can imagine and psychologically devastate until you just quit, give up, and surrender. 

The only way that I’m aware of in how to deal with a Narc is to completely ghost them. They no longer exist. No closure, no nothing, you just leave, cut communication and never ever go back. Being this is your BIL you will see him occasionally, just know that he will always be looking for a way back in any means necessary... even your future child. Hopefully your husband can fully see it as well, I hope you two are united in this. It’s a fairly grim situation, I’m sorry. 

I wish you strength and wellness."
You just get a divorce lawyer.  Your husband sounds awful
"Man, must be a lot of fun watching you try to not blow up every situation you put your hands on."
"Have her read ""Why Does He DO That?"" by Lundy Bancroft.  This is a book that characterizes abusers by someone who worked with abusive men for 14 years.  I also recommend ""The Gift of Fear"" by Gavin De Becker.  He is a security consultant.

The De Becker book is disturbing (real case studies of awful, awful men) but talks a lot about why we have gut feelings and that we should listen.  He also talks about abusive men a bit and covers stalkers very well.  You should read them first.  FYI, De Becker's high-profile client who he doesn't name is Olivia Newton-John.

Also send her to loveisrespect(dot)org.  There are lots of articles there that could be useful for her and also for you.  Specifically, look under the Resources tab for an article on understanding teen dating violence and sexual assault.  There are also quizzes and apparently it's teen domestic violence month.

If you think I'm way off base, well, I'm not.  This guy is Bad News.  He is abusing her emotionally right now and has stepped up a notch into physical abuse by breaking her phone."
"Yeah she was in the bathroom with the door locked, hiding behind the toilet or something, and he got up and shot into the bathroom several times. Like bullshit. She ran and hid from him and he killed her."
Buying alcohol to the point that it negatively affects you or your social relationships is what separates drinkers from alcoholics.
"&gt; she made a comment about how I should want to start working out more to “look good for my wedding”. I recognize that it was just kind of an offhand comment, but when I expressed it was kind of an unkind thing to say, she doubled down.  
&gt;  
&gt;For background - My body image has been a big problem point for me for most of my life. I definitely got some issues projected onto me as a not-small kid, and struggled with an eating disorder in my teens, until the age of twenty.

Sounds like your Mom is a big part of why you struggle with body image and suffered from an eating disorder.  I know you want to believe she means well, but I don't see that in her.  She sounds like my mother-in-law...always ""right"", always meddling, always giving unsolicited advice, always assuming everyone else wants to line up with her values system and should.

If you mom knows you struggled with an eating disorder then SHE KNOWS her comment was inappropriate.  You even pointed it out and she wouldn't back down.

I think you need to discuss this with her in a moment when she hasn't said anything and be VERY clear about your boundaries.  

""Mom, you know my struggles with my weight and self esteem.  I've made it clear that comments about my weight are NOT welcome, especially not regarding my wedding.  Please do not make any more comments about it at all...not about the wedding, not after the wedding, not ever.  I need you to respect that.  If you can't, I will walk away from conversations/hang up the phone, etc""."
"Spoiler alert: *I have never met someone who admitted to being an abuser*.

Ever. I've helped people escape even worse situations than yours and their partner always had some fucking excuse.

"I'm sorry, he physically drags you out of the driver's seat against your will? You're not overreacting, this whole thing is a red flag"
"I would say that conversation starts the next time he starts to initiate with a big fat ""No!"". Sex is not a marital ""right"" that you are blocking him from. It's mutual enjoyment. How does he not notice that you're not enjoying yourself? That alone sends up a lot of red flags about the situation, unless you are the world's best sex scene actress.

His attitude and behavior are MORE than enough to explain how you feel, but I thought I'd point out that hormone imbalance after childbirth can really kill your libido also. Definitely something to discuss with your OBGYN or GP if you sense there's a biological thing going on or you don't want sex/can't orgasm at *all* anymore, like even for Henry Cavill's bod😉"

After any verbal professional communication (phone or in person), i'll follow up with a quick ""Hey, just to make sure I understand completely, I'm to do X, and Y and Z. If any of that is incorrect or if there's other information, please let me know ASAP"".  

That covers your ass in case they told you the wrong information, and it covers their ass that they did communicate it to you in a timely manner.

The amount of times I've had my ass saved by something like this is immeasurable.  /r/MaliciousCompliance and /r/talesfromtechsupport  are COVERED in stories about times where getting instructions in writing saved their ass.

If you can't get it in an e-mail chain for whatever reason, it's also useful to keep notes.  I keep Notepad open on my computer, and each day as I go through the day I take notes on interactions with coworkers and clients so that even if there's no official chain, I can still look back and see the general notes of a conversation I had a week ago. My work diary goes back several years and I've had to refer to it several times. 

In cases like with what you're going through a simple ""Hi Richard, as per our verbal conversation on 07/09/2019 you informed me that a delivery would be late but did not have the exact arrival date. Please let me know as soon as you have that information."" Now the ball is totally in his court. If you end up missing a deadline because he didn't get the information to you, thats on him and you can show ""I sent this e-mail on X date and a followup on Y date and never heard back from Richard."""
"I'm sorry but that proposal was a stupid idea. She dropped hints that you shouldn't ask and... you asked anyway? You don't even live together? She's only 23? This was a bad idea from the start.

I think you're trying to use this proposal as a way to force a commitment and force things to be okay. This is a very weird and roundabout way of communicating. You want more commitment, you want her to move. That's not unreasonable (at all) after 5 years of being together. You should talk about a timeline for closing the distance. You should get mad if she insists on not moving. You should break up if it turns out she's just not that invested and does not want to move for you.

Not use a proposal as some weird power play. A proposal should be something you both want and see coming and welcome. Discuss your actual problems."
"Yeah, it is the same in the UK from my experience. Apparently seeing each other multiple times a week for weeks and me meeting their parents didn't mean that we were exclusive lol.
That shit still hurts."
"Dump him, dump him, DUMP HIM! That controlling behavior will only get worse"
"Yeah, but try to be kind because the hurt you are feeling will be very similar to what she feels when she finds out. So try to do it with compassion and grace, because she may not respond well but that’s because it’s hard to hear things like that. But she does deserve to know."
Yeah something is weird here. I'm not sure why this guy has her convinced that accidents equal emotional immaturity.
"This this this. 

OP there is nothing wrong with asserting your boundaries. Think about how men act in these situations. If someone is touching them and they dont like it they assert themself and say stop. I understand women are conditioned to just deal with shit but please, tell him bluntly, no please and thank you, not politeness, that you dont like it and tell him to stop. You do not have to be greatful that someone respects your autonomy. You do not have to plead with someone to respect your space. You are not the one being unreasonable, he is crossing boundaries."
"Next time he needs to crash I’ll make him pay, or he’ll find someone else. 

I just hate how he’s acting like we’re going to spend a week at his place. I asked him because it’s convenient and my date and I won’t be able to drives ourselves home anyway and 45 minutes of cab is going to be very expensive... it just sucks, coming from him, plus he’s complaining he’ll have to go to his boyfriends place instead… weird."
"Of course not. Her son is a good, pure Christian boy. His girlfriend is the evil vixen who tempted him away from the path of righteousness with her dirty female body. The girlfriend was sent straight from Hell itself to lure her sweet, precious little lamb of a son away from the loving arms of God. Her beautiful, pious boy never would have had an impure thought in his chaste little head if this wicked girl hadn't come along."
"At some point you got to be honest and tell him the truth (in a nice way at least). 
It’s either that or continue being miserable by his touch which no one should live like that :("
"If you need money for the abortion, PM me and I'll contribute."
"&gt;keep him as a professional contact.

🤔"
Is banging another girl the only thing you can think of?
"Yeah, They actually started defending the girl who sprayed me, I had none of that.

I think our relationship is done."
Take the divorce. Schedule an sonnet with a family attorney asap.
"I think everyone else has great points. But also, she can fuck right off for using gay as an insult. Is she fucking 12?"
"If it is considered cheating to you, then it is cheating.  It is irrelevant what other people think."
