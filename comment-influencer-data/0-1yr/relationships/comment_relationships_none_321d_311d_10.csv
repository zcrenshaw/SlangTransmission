"He's calling you abusive because he doesn't want to get called out on his bullshit. 

* Stop trying to contact him.

* Consult a lawyer for advice on the car, the lease, and the dog.

* Go ahead and talk about it to any friends you think might be helpful."
"&gt;I know for a fact he buys weed every week, and eats out a lot. Last year, he straight up forgot my birthday.

How expensive is a picnic? Bottle of wine, cheese and crackers, some sandwiches.. He's had a month to figure it out. I just don't think your bday was a priority.

I wouldnt expect his behavior to change with a lawsuit payout. "
You're 32.  The world is full of men who haven't cheated on you and gotten someone else pregnant.
"If you want to work through this, meet up &amp; hear her out. If she’s focused on getting her apology from you instead of discussing what happened, then I would bail. (Note that I think you should apologize for the specific words you chose to express your anger. I don’t think you’re wrong for being angry, but you could’ve expressed it differently, without swearing at her etc.) If you get through that, I would be interested to hear how she plans to change her behavior moving forward. You had a medical emergency, &amp; she basically left you to fend for yourself. Luckily, we live in the age of phones we can reach form our beds, &amp; also luckily, you have other people you can depend on besides her. But I would want to know how she plans to change her behavior in the future when you’re feeling unwell. 

I think it’s possible that this was a wake up call for her that not everyone she encounters in this world will be like her parents &amp; that she needs to work on those issues. But I also think it’s possible that she’s just trying to assuage her guilt here &amp; will end up trying to shift blame back onto you for not doing enough to convince her this was a serious health problem. "
Have you ever confronted your dad about how you feel here? And you have no obligation to allow your dad to give a speech or dance with him at your wedding if you don't feel comfortable about it.
"You keep calling it stupid and Petty and you know what? It's not. You've had all these little slights and confirmations as you grew. You also have to remember that when you're smaller, your world is smaller. Changes and favoritism has a much larger affect for a lot of reasons. This has been your life since you were born, and it's clearly affected your views on the world and the people in your family. You say you're introverted and your sister isn't, well, I would guess some of that favoritism probably has something to do with it. The thing is, this is a big deal for a person who is growing. As an adult, sure it seems small and Petty, but your father didn't have you as an adult. He raised you and he chose to have this kind of relationship with you. It's not petty, it's obvious and that hurts you. 

Personally, your father shouldn't be allowed to speak at your wedding if that's how you feel. Did you even confront him, by chance about his clear and obvious favoritism? Where the hell was your mother during all of this. She sounds like she just followed suit. On the bright side, this lack of favoritism has probably made you a wildly dependable and independent person who values the few, small friendships you have. It's not the number of people you know, it's how much you know about the people that you are close with, that matters.

"
"""It's not that I would want a commission from you. It's that in the time it takes to do this work for you, I'd be giving up 3-5+ commissions from OTHER people, because we're just that busy right now, and you need an agent who can give you more time. I could afford to not get your commission, but I can't afford to give up what amounts to a month's salary by passing on paying clients to take on you for free."""
Thanks for the update! It sounds like she is legitimately putting in effort to get over her issues rather than just trying to appease you. I'm glad things are working out. 
"Start planning to be apart.

Separate Your finances.

Contact a lawyer or legal aid about your car and lease.

If you know where he lives, drop off his dog &amp; stuff.

He is being difficult because he got caught stepping out and was too lazy a/o cowardly to break up with you earlier.

Sorry this happened to you, but I am willing to bet, you will see that this relationship has been over for awhile, at least the healthy part has been.

Good luck"
"Woah!  Don't dump your boyfriend!  Tell him thanks for having your back! Sounds like a stand-up dude.  And tell your family some stranger on the internet thinks they're all assholes!

&amp;#x200B;

Brother is toxic, yikes.  Why even be around someone who thinks of you like this and makes your life more difficult?

&gt; My brother told my boyfriend he was just trying to help him because he wouldn't want to date someone with my history. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
"on the 'maybe be friends' thing...

don't do that to yourself :/ it'll just keep re-opening old wounds. Plus, if she betrayed your trust when you were dating she'll absolutely do it when you're not"
"Another non-favourite child over here and your post broke my heart. :/


&gt; So for 3 more years her 2-story suite sat empty and I was stuck in the tiny bedroom.

That is super awful but tbh, that's as much on your mom as your dad. She just sat back and didn't advocate for you?


Agree with the others saying he doesn't get to walk you down the aisle or give a speech at your wedding. He hasn't earned it. I'm so sorry he wasn't the dad you needed. Have you tried therapy? You can't change him but you can change your reaction to him."
Any person who is buying weed every week and is perpetually broke is not really someone you want to be with.  If you are going to smoke that much at least have the foresight to be economically responsible about it...
Why don't you just block him everywhere and move on with your life? It sounds that the reason he finished things with you didn't work out and he wants to use you as a back up plan. Just continue ignoring him and moving on with your life.
"This would not be a situation I would want to be in. Based on your post, I would demand he give your key back. 

The whole thing just seems sketchy. I couldn’t imagine dating someone for 1 1/2 years and never going to his house. If he says it’s because he needs to clean it, why hasn’t he done that yet? "

"Not expensive at all. Cheap bottle of wine, a couple small cheeses and crackers is all I told him I was expecting. $20 *max*. I don't think I was a priority either. :( This sucks."
"OP, I'm hijacking the top comment to ask you why you want your father to walk you down the aisle, dance with you or do anything that would remind you on your wedding day how he really makes you feel. Why do you want him to make you feel bad on a day when you're supposed to feel special? There's no guarantee that he won't use your wedding day to reference your sister's wedding or announce her pregnancy or something. Ask a friend to raise a toast, ask a grandparent or an uncle or sibling to dance with you. If he makes a fuss, point out that you never had that sort of unconditional love that he gave your sister and he never had that sort of relationship with you and that you don't trust him not to make the day all about him and your sister. In one of your comments below you mention how the same people who attended your sister's wedding will be there for yours and you worry about the contrast. That's not on you, it's on him. People won't look at that scene playing out and not wonder why a little kid was unlovable to her father but they'll wonder why a grown man couldn't manage to make both his kids feel loved. You can even joke about it in your speech, talk about how your sister was the princess growing up while you were Cinderella/Harry Potter in your tiny room...etc. 

I would chat with your mum and dad about this and ask why you were treated differently growing up. I'm not sure if you're going to get any answers but at least you'll get some sort of closure. I think the solution provided by one of the commenters below is best - lower your expectations and disengage. "
"&gt;I just want to know the reason behind all this behaviour and how/why I triggered it.

I can tell you why!

&gt;The one thing I do not do, as others do, is give her the attention she very clearly craves.

You don't validate her! You don't console her when she tells the office her sob stories, and so therefore she's decided that you're 'mean' because she is the centre of her universe, and anyone who isn't constantly paying attention to her is terrible.

For someone like that, anyone who is naturally quiet/shy or anyone who has clear boundaries between their work and their personal lives is mean. Where you went 'wrong' is that when she told people about not having any friends outside work, you were \*meant\* to go 'That sounds awful, I'm so sorry!'; when she was telling everyone about wanting an abortion you were \*meant\* to go 'Noooooooo you'll be such a good mom, don't say that! I'm sure you can do it!'. You didn't, which meant that her attention seeking didn't work, which means that she was just left as someone who overshared for no good reason, which \*means\* for her that you're mean.

This woman sucks. I've worked with people like her before, and they all suck. They're exhausting and petty and worst of all \*boring\* to be around; I can't stand someone who will punish you for not sucking up to them.

If you're brave enough: don't contribute to the present, and ignore her during the baby shower. You aren't mean, she's obnoxious.

If that's too difficult, contribute the minimum amount to the gift that you think is socially acceptable and do the bare minimum at the baby shower. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but it's not you, and you'll be leaving soon – she'll be a funny story you can tell one day.

**EDIT:** Also, do *not* talk to her about her behaviour towards you. She'll pretend that oh, she was just joking! 'Haha, I was just saying that stuff because you're so *serious* all the time!' Then she'll tell people behind your back that you're soooooooo weird, you've been soooooo mean to her the entire time you've been there and now you're, like, turning abound and accusing *her* of being mean?? Can you imagine???  
This is because the best moment in her life was probably when she cyberbullied a girl in high school into deleting her MySpace and she'll never be able to reach those dizzying heights again."
"They told you they are disowning you. That's what ""not letting another lineage into our family tree"" means. You are no longer considered part of the family tree. 

So fuck yes, you go no contact. 

Tell them to call you when they've accepted your relationship and are supporting you as their daughter."
"* It is wildly inappropriate for them to leverage your relationship with your brother into their financial planning

* It is wildly inappropriate for them to involve you in that conversation

* You are right: it would be inappropriate to make your parents' shittiness your brother's problem

"First of all, your boyfriend is awesome. He handled that situation like a champ.

Second, I would really consider limiting contact with your family. It sounds like part of the reason you ended up in an abusive relationship is because you are conditioned to abuse via your family. Definitely don't tell them anything personal from here on out that they can weaponize against you. I'm sorry you went through that, but you at least saw that your boyfriend has your back, which is so valuable.

I would also consider trying to make some friends because having one person as your entire support system is a dangerous place to be."
"This is actually stalker behaviour. I hope you haven't responded to her since you've said you forgave her. I hope you've blocked her number everywhere. And when you get texts from random numbers that are clearly her, take a photograph, block and move on. The photographs will come in handy if you ever need to get a restraining order against her. I doubt that this is gonna be the last of her bullshit. She came all the way over from Russia to see you and enrolled on a course where you teach. Depending on what kind of school this is, she could do this again and again. (But that also depends on any visa she holds - that's an area I really don't know a lot about). Make sure all your doors and windows are secure at night and don't hesitate to call the police if she tries anything. I'm sorry dude but I really doubt this is over. But since she's Russian, she'll have to go back to her own country eventually. Just be wary until then."
"I'm really sorry about your mother, OP, and about everything else, but if, god forbid, your mother doesn't survive this, you're never going to have answers from her, either. She was an accomplice in your father's favoritism. My dad always favored my sister, but my mom was the one that would point out to him that he was playing favorites. You deserve answers.

I wouldn't bring it up in regards to a wedding that isn't planned yet, but you can bring up your sister's wedding as an example along with the ones you stated already. Getting the answers might not change anything and you might not even get answers, but if you want closure, you have to ask the questions before it's too late."
Your son no longer goes over there or sees his grandmother until she apologizes and your husband should be the one to inform her of her newly limited contact. I assume you know what goes on at conversion camps. She basically threatened to have him physically abused and psychologically damaged. There is a reason those places are being outlawed. 
I thought it was going to turn out completely opposite. Glad it went ok.
He’s actually told me we need to have a “cleaning party” and I can help him clean it. Why does all of this sound worse when I type it out....
"You need to drag your husband to a midwife or OBGYN and have HER, or any medical professional, explain why this is a bad idea.

"Your family is deeply cruel. It sounds like the only person who actually cares about your comfort and healing is your boyfriend. 

It’s time to start building a support network outside your family. AND your boyfriend. Make friends with people you can trust and who can be there for you if your relationship doesn’t work out. Don’t rely on your family - they don’t prioritize you *at all*. Surround yourself with kind, positive people and start thinking about how much of a role you’ll allow your family to play in your life once you no longer depend on them. "
"Being bi and supportive of trans people does not obligate you to stay in your relationship when your partner has changed the terms so dramatically. Your position is a fair one in my eyes. What comes next is the hard part because I would not suggest you present this in any way as an ultimatum or challenge. I think you need to be ready to say you're happy for her to be at a point that she's ready to live the way she really feels, and that as sad as it makes you, you realize this will change your feelings about her compared to your feelings towards the male 'Chris' and you won't be able to stay in a romantic partnership with her.

"I'm Indian, dating a Chinese man. For what it's worth, hiding relationships from parents is fairly common in Asian households. We usually wait to tell our parents until the relationship is serious and we see a long-term future together. We started dating at 20 and I waited 3 years to tell my parents. However, we always had the understanding that we would not let the BS of our parents dictate our relationship. If they weren't okay with the interracial, interfaith relationship, that was their problem. 

I would suggest talking to your boyfriend about what he would do if his parents refused to accept the relationship if and when he tells them. Will he side with them and break up with you? Will he try to balance the two? Is he willing to cut contact with his parents for a relationship? 

But also, if you don't want to deal with any of this, you don't have to. "

"28f, married my online gaming sweetheart after 10+ years of LDR.

Online you is different than real you, no matter how transparent you’ve been or how close you’ve gotten. In our younger days, I was like your BF - talked up the romantic gestures, planned things to do together, promised I was in love with who her faults.

Then she came over and I turned into an ogre who was indifferent and stressed and confused. Hilariously, this happened a few times over a few visits, including cringeworthy “ok now that you’re home I’m breaking up” scenes.

It is natural for people to slowly form bonds with people in person to determine the amount of trust to be placed in them. LDRs closing the gap go to a weird spot - you know in your head you love this person and want to be close to them, but your body doesn’t know them.

You simply have to slow down. Don’t expect perfection. Don’t promise nights of passion or endless kisses or whatever. Plan to date like you don’t know each other. If you push too hard to install in his life without that base physical familiarity, you’re both going to feel like imposters playing house with each other.

I was lucky that my wife really liked me even though I was a confused anxious mess, and we rode it out. Eventually the visits happened as we wished them to be - nonstop laughing and unabashed love and total comfort between each other. You’ll get there, I promise.

LDRs are ridiculously hard, OP. You’re mailing your glass hearts back and forth and hoping they make it back to you in one piece. For this relationship to work, you need to focus on two things: totally transparent communication that allows you two to trust each other with your ugliest thoughts, and an understanding that your relationship will progress much more slowly than a traditional one. "
"&gt;He feels there was no closure in their divorce

So he decided to open that up again.  He's pretty much ensured that it will be another 18 *years* before the woman is out of his life.

There is no reason for you to try to get past this.   Get this guy out of your life and find someone who wants to have a family with you.  And be sure to let your family know why you had to break up with him.
"
"No, my family's going through a lot right now so it just seems too petty and adolescent to bring up. My mom just found out she has a brain tumor, so in comparison this isn't a big deal."
"OP, I’ve been reading your post history, and it seems like your relationship might be suffering from more than just one problem. If you’re asking for permission to break up, you don’t need it. Without pointing fingers at either of you, there’s a high chance both of you might be better apart. "
"&gt;so I don’t want to escalate this,

You have to.  Your husband is already in an emotional affair with this girl and things are going to get worse if he doesn't shut this down.

You said he has always been boundary challenged and this is the result.  Why are you so afraid of stepping up and telling him that you will not be married to a man who wants a girlfriend on the side.  What are you going to do once he starts sleeping with her?

It's time for you to step up and protect yourself.  Tell him he gets to choose between making an appointment with a counselor to explain why he has become so attached to this woman or he needs to move out while you consult with a lawyer about making a life for yourself and your daughter without him...and mean it."
"You deserve better.

You're gonna get better.

May the next man in your life look like a mix of Mahershala Ali and Oscar Isaac and Jon Hamm and Idris Elba and smell like fine brandy and treat you like the goddamn goddess you are.

And may he come along after you've had time to heal.

edit: It's a hard world sometimes and we should take the love and good feelings and happiness where we can.

And no, I don't have the cloning machine online yet."
"&gt; Should she just have to suck it up and deal with it? 

Yes.  
Plans with your boyfriend for no reason have to include her. In fact, they more than often shouldn't, especially in the case of vacations. If I wanted a vacation with my girlfriend, I would like it to just be the two of us."
I’m Brazilian and your girlfriend is full of crap.
"Your BF sucks.

He can buy takeout and weed for himself, but he can’t afford the one thing you asked him to buy... that says a lot about his priorities. 

Don’t expect that $50k settlement to come through, or for you to see any of that money if it does. He’s shown you that he doesn’t keep his promises and he can’t handle his money. "
"1. she shouldn't have introduced the kid to you without telling you before hand. It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to Ben. The kid is 4 and while children forget things, the fact that he saw his father glaze over/ border on panic attack on his first time meeting him is *probably* traumatizing.
2. do not feel guilty for this. She unilaterally decided to keep the child without informing you. Yes, it's her body and her choices, but the fact that you were in no way part of her decisions about the kid and did not know of his existence means you really cannot be held responsible for his life up until now. Now, you can make your own decision on whether you want to be part of his life.
3. since money isn't an issue, find a lawyer that deals with child law. There are most likely legal status issues with you being the biological father to this child (~~also get a paternity test alongside finding a lawyer~~ you already got one), it's best to find an expert who can advise you on such things.
4. in deciding whether to be involved in his life/ how far you want to be involved, I would suggest seeking therapy. I know, therapy is something that is suggested for 99% of the posts here, but if you can afford it, the space to simply talk without being judged is very valuable.
5. things to ask yourself: do you want kids/ do you see yourself enjoying time with kids? do you want the life long responsibility of taking care of a kid (18+ years)? do you want to parent with your ex? The last question is a very important one, because she's already made a not so great decision by introducing Ben to you in person without giving you any warning. You need to accept that, if you want to be part of Ben's life, you will have to co-parent with your ex and it is likely you will come in conflict with some parenting decisions.

If, after consideration, you don't want anything to do with your ex but feel some responsibility for the child, it might not be a bad idea to put aside money for Ben for when he's 18 and (likely) going to college. I know money doesn't buy people, but I would consider reaching out to him when he's legally an adult and explain your choices and why you did what you did."
"Another non-favorite child here. Just want to say to OP that I believe you and know how much this stuff hurts. I haven't had any success in making my parents see differently either. They have a million excuses for how it's not true they have favorites and how I'm imagining things and overreacting, but years of their actions dictate differently and their dismissal of my feelings adds to it. And any time I bring it up, I know I'm really risking falling even further from their favor because I'm ""just acting like a child"" no matter how calmly I bring it up. I wish I had good advice for you but mostly I just wanted to say you aren't alone and I can relate to how you feel. "
"Next time she leads you away ""what are you doing? I'm an adult. Please don't babysit me. If I wanted to engage this girl in drama, I've had plenty of opportunities to do so, but haven't. Can you, as my friend, please respect me enough to stop making a bigger deal out of this than it is?"""
"&gt; He won’t even have sex with me when I’m feeling horny because I “don’t want to fuck him like he wants” 

&amp;#x200B;

No offense, but he seems terrible. It would be one thing if you weren't having it as often as he would like, but he won't have sex with you because it's not a certain type of way?  I guess I don't understand exactly how he wants to be pleased. Maybe you'd be more inclined for adventure if he didn't treat you like that.  "
"Honey, I've been in this boat. Do NOT give them money.

EDIT: Also, do not let anyone know how much money you make or have, in any way. Ever. "
"&gt; How can I get him to see me as a whole person and not just the maid?

Just re-read that sentence. And honestly think about it hard. You just openly admitted that your ""boyfriend"" literally treats like you hired help. Yet you're asking how to fix it. 

Leave this asshole. "
At my brother's wedding my dad said in his speech that my brother's wife was the daughter he never had...ouch. I confronted him about it later and I think it was mostly a slip up but everyone looked at me during it and I'll never live down how shitty it made me feel.
"He didn't take time off to help you. He took time off with the hopes that you'd be in bed drugged up and he could spend all of his time gaming. This guy is an absolute waste of space.

I mean, how would you feel if your best friend told you this was how her boyfriend was treating her after surgery? After he promised he'd take care of her? I certainly don't think you'd accuse her if being the shrill anti-gamer girl.

Look. Your boyfriend would rather risk your health so he can play video games. Nobody is stupid enough to do this on accident. He's treating you like this on purpose because he wants to. He's made a decision to treat you like shit, and is mad at you when you expect anything better.

So tell me. Is this what you think love looks like?"
"“He said he felt suffocated in our relationship and was not the relationship kind of guy” translated to the very probable truth is “I realised that having you as my girlfriend is preventing me from sleeping with other women” Wouldn’t be surprised if he did right after, perhaps with someone he thought was “better” than you (for a relationship or not) and is now regretting his decision/is single again after being ditched himself/is on a dry spell. Probably missing the comfort and safety off a relationship or looking to use you for sex (with or without the relationship) until he finds a new victim or what he is looking for. 

I would personally stay clear of him. Do you really want to be with someone again who had no problem ditching you and couldn’t even be bothered to console or explain to you why he was doing it? He sounds like the kind of guy that uses people for as long as it suits his needs then discards them when he sees other opportunities. Classic cheater, but with the technicality of not being a cheater because he broke up with you before he went ahead with it. Opportunistic, unloyal, charming.. you know.. the typical douche. Block and look ahead. "
"Personally, I’d sign a group card and that’s it. She’s nasty to you, she doesn’t deserve your generosity."
You have no responsibility to be a “teachable moment” for a bigot. Life isn’t an after-school special.
"&gt; ...and I don’t want that for him

Okay, but...what does he want for him?"
That’s a dealbreaker. I’d cut contact with them indefinitely. They offer you conditional love and acceptance. Fuck that noise. You can assemble a better family than that. Tip toeing around shitbags and giving them passive acceptance is why we’re in the mess that we’re in. 
Because he needs her to clean it
"Thats not insecurities.

Thats sadism.

He's not even sorry.

He's testing you. First its a pinch, then its a slap, a smack, a shove, a punch. He is testing YOU and your boundaries. 

The question to you is; do you want to be with someone that wants to beat you? That enjoys inflicting pain? Cuz this isn't even BDSM, which is all about respect, consent and prior negotiations. This is some Jian Gomeshi level bullshit."
"&gt;my husband has become incredibly cagey with his phone since then. He will be lying next to me with his brightness turned down texting who I would assume is coworker. Lately he’s been avoiding the part where he actually tells me it’s her he’s talking to

That's a big ole red flag.

&gt;found a ridiculous amount of messages to and from her, and they really rubbed me up the wrong way. It was mostly her initiating the complimenting, usually telling him how ridiculously hot she finds him as well as several questions about me and his daughter. I could be wrong but it really came off as her trying to scope out the current state of our marriage. Some texts verbatim said stuff like “are you happy with (wife’s name?)”, and “what was the appeal of getting married for u considering the kind of lifestyle you could’ve lived instead?” Just stuff that for whatever reason pissed me off. I just hated how she was alternating between this subtle kind of flirting and then being rather sexually aggressive.

That's a massive set of red flags. She is 100% testing the waters to see if he'll bite on the ""I'm unhappy with my marriage/life"" so they can sleep together.

He's having an emotional affair right now, and it's only a matter of time before it escalates to physical.

He needs to stop this right away. It's not harmless. It's not ""just talking."" It's not something he should be allowed to deflect or laugh off, **he's having an emotional affair FFS.** I can't believe you've let him deflect this stuff.

Honestly I was starting to write up all the things you should say and address in your post, but I think this text exchange says it all:

&gt;There was also one text that said something along the lines of, “I could never work alone with u hahaha, I don’t trust either of us”, and he most decidedly did NOT shut it down, replying something about how it was a good thing they weren’t left alone together for long amounts of time.

There is **no** appropriate context for that exchange. That is 100% sexual and they are openly stating they believe if they spend time alone together they will hook up. That's beyond inappropriate.

If he can't admit to what he's doing and can't realize how fucked up that kind of text is (and yes I'd make him read the texts aloud) then you're just sitting aroudn waiting for him to cheat. It's time to draw a line in the sand: either he admits he's emotionally cheating and cuts her off (no texting or talking outside of work) or you leave. Because he will cheat physically soon, he and her have already joked about it."
"As much as you have a problem with your fiancé’s mother, the primary issue is with your fiancé. It’s on him to keep her at bay and set boundaries. Talk to him not just as a woman who doesn’t want to be around his abuser but as a mother—mention being concerned about your child around him and how important it is in their development to not be around abusers.

“She’s better now” doesn’t mean she’s good enough to be around an impressionable child. "

Cut them out of your lives. They sound like ghastly people. I'm sorry they're your family."
"This is a bad, bad sign. It shows a lack of empathy and compassion with you on the greatest scale, for grief; I would highly suggest you reconsider why you're with this guy. It doesn't sound like he cares for you at all tbh."
"Yeah, I was one of her most ardent critics in the OP, and I have to admit this is about the best possible response she could have come forward with to try and salvage things.

It's good that she took a lot of proactive steps with reaching out to her therapist and stuff, but if he stays with her,  he needs to make sure she follows through on getting help and therapy for her issues. They were lucky it was not a life-threatening situation this time, but that type of reaction could have been the difference between life and death in other circumstances and would be completely unacceptable if children were involved.  

Good first step. I hope it goes well, OP. Make sure she sticks to it. "
"Yeah, he expected you to buy his kids' costumes.  And he's using you for housing and food and housekeeping (guessing you do the cooking and cleaning and such at your place).

At a minimum, tell him that he needs to have his weekends with his kids at his house.  And you should reconsider having him overnight when you have your kid home (assuming you don't have your child home every day).  So, on nights when either of you has a kid, you're at your own respective homes, spending time with your kids.

But, ultimately, realize this guy isn't a good fit for the long haul.  He's looking for a Sugar Mommy to take care of his responsibilities.  

And that's realky NOT how you want to spend the next couple decades."
"&gt; **People won't look at that scene playing out and not wonder why a little kid was unlovable to her father but they'll wonder why a grown man couldn't manage to make both his kids feel loved** 

I wanted to highlight this for OP. "
"I couldn't agree more you'll really need your friends in the months ahead.  Plus he could already be talking to your friends and telling his side of the story best to get there first.

I too wouldn't try contacting him anymore go straight to an attorney and have the attorney communicate for you.  

Also consider some counseling sounds like this guy could have been mentally abusive for years which can wear you down over time."
The point of dating is to see if the other person is a good life partner. This guy is not a good life partner. 
It's not unhealthy and it's totally normal! A lot of people need time to process things when they are upset. Not sure why he doesn't understand that.
"I feel bad for you.   
Does he work a lot ? Maybe his work is impacting his sex drive and he also feels bad about it."
"Hey fiancé, we need to define what a date means for each of us apparently. 
To me a date involves physical attraction at the very least and the intent to be romantic. And that is not okay for me in a monogamous relationship. 
What is your definition of a “date”fiancé? "
"Well, honest answer, I think a lot of us just grin and bear it when it comes to having to spend time with intolerable family. Just smile and nod, and seem engaged, even though your mind is a thousand miles away on a beach somewhere. Because god DAMN I could not give two shits about my cousins 8th newborn baby, or that someone is getting remarried for the 3rd time. 

You have to ask yourself why you want a stronger relationship. Is it for yourself? You wish to be closer to them? Or is it solely to placate the family’s wishes to see you more? You should only pursue it if it’s something YOU want. If you’re more into the game of showing face time because they want to see you, and less about actually becoming closer to them, then you’re just gonna have to bear it and just act engaged even though you’re not.

When it comes to family, sadly a lot of us just put up with these songs and dances, to avoid drama. Unless they’re a constant influence in your life, or unless they’re downright awful toward you, just throw them the occasional bone of pretending to be interested in their life during gatherings. "
"A dude you’ve been seeing for 90 days is at your apartment looking through your stuff and texts you when he finds something that you haven’t felt the need to make his business yet?

Um, no. There’s the door, Bucko. "
That makes it sound even more intentional. 
"&gt;I guess we are an odd case. Even the day before he moved out, we still went hiking together. Since separation, we have been on a few trips together as friends. I still deeply care about him, and he still hopes there is more. Neither of us is dating.

I would be careful with this. I have a friend who remained super-close with his separated wife like you describe. Honestly, the continued closeness seemed to make it a lot harder on him and drag the whole thing out unnecessarily. He was always hoping they could work it out and find a way to reconcile, and she gave him mixed signals even though I think she knew all along that they were never getting back together. It felt like she wanted to have her cake and eat it too, and it came at the expense of him being able to move on with his life."

"You know this wasn't an ""honest accident."" For starters, that level of damage is not going to happen by knocking the bag off the counter. Some damage--some powders being smashed maybe. But everything in there being damaged is intentional. I've knocked my bag off the counter plenty of times. Hell I throw mine in my suitcase when I pack for trips and nothings been that damaged. 

And the fact that you asked him to replace it and he said ""no it's too expensive and forget it"" is another sign this is BS.

Don't date someone who doesn't respect your belongings OP. Even if your boyfriend doesn't like make up, you told him it's not up for debate and now this happens? I'd be pissed. Good make up is expensive and this disrespectful. "
"My thought would be stop trying to impress men, work to be the best you. Don't work out to be attractive, work our to be healthy or look the way you want to look. Study what you like, not what you think guys would want to talk about etc. There is a lot to be said for a person who loves themselves is more attractive. You sound to be missing that. Go get it, the love from another will come easier after you love yourself. "
He invited his own brother on orgy?? That's next level weird 
"Do NOT invite her unless you want to torpedo your relationship with your BF. 

This level of dependency is actually not normal or healthy for either of you, and the more you cater to her and bow to her wishes, the longer it's going to take for her to grow up and start being a functional adult with a social life. 

I'm sorry but you really should start spending LESS time with her instead of more. Expect that she will react extremely badly, that is normal when one person in a relationship tries to alter the balance of the relationship."
You didn't overreact. That was a shitty thing to say. Especcialy so after you told him you are not interested im casual sex. He showed pretty clearly how little respect he has both for you and the girl he's looking to date.
This is immediately what I thought too. In his mind he crossed a line. His natural response to that is to pull back. This is actually a really good thing. If he decided to keep crossing that line professionally what kind of person would that make him?  Drop this and move on. Please don’t try to force this. He is being a really decent person by stepping back and disengaging.  
"Great advice here. 

You know you’re in the right. 

You didn’t overreact. He’s ensured you feel so paralyzed you can’t react. He’s so uncaring he left his elderly dog with you, someone he deems abusive? Nah. He’s full of it and he knows it. 

And gee OP the poor man was trying to end the relationship but you were too self involved to see it? Maybe he should try yelling real loud “this is over” before having a damn affair with someone else lol

You’re not abusive, at least not here. And he is doing all he can to control this. So. 

What you’re doing is waiting for him to tell you what to do next. You may not realize it but you are. Stop. 

Call a lawyer. Can’t afford one? Call anyway. Know a family member? Drop the dog off. Rent together? Talk to the landlord. 1 tenant abandoned you with the lease. You want to break it. Ask how. 

Lawyer will help with car. 

Deep breath. Make the call. Make calls and start managing things. Its going to scare him when he realizes you’re not paralyzed by this. Move. Take action. You’ll feel better for it. I promise. Once you start moving it’ll start to heal. "
"I'm so sorry this has happened.  Talk to your teacher about getting a counseling referral for you to talk to someone about what is happening.

Your feelings about your mom are completely understandable.  There is nothing you can do about your mom and the funeral or his belongings though.  She was your dad's legal wife and everything is stacked in her favor.

What you can do, is get busy packing and removing anything of your dad's that you want.  Do it while your mom is out of the house and find a place to store them.   Also, is there a relative you could stay with for a while?

"Since it happened in june, you're just finding out, i'm going to assume that the ONLY reason you found out was because there's no avoiding it because of the pregnancy. which means that if she \*hadn't\* gotten pregnant, he'd just have cheated - UNPROTECTED - and you would never know. he exposed you to STDs and the ONLY reason you even found out was because he knocked her up to boot. he's garbage. sometimes you just have to throw the whole man away."
Throwing things when angry is a huge red flag.

Ask him to replace the items and see how he reacts.
This is the new gf talking. She probably asked him to cut contact with you and other people. She might be extremely jealous and/or controlling. Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about it other than wish they fail and be there for him when he realizes his mistake. 
"I wouldn't have the dad perform anything special at your wedding just a regular guest. reason being it'd be best if you didn't have a part dedicated to being reminded how much more your dad prefers his other daughter.

I don't know when the best time to bring up your grievances would be but at the very latest I'd say about when you start planning the wedding you should have discussed this by then or right then.

&gt;But that ended up being my last DDD, too. The next 3 years my dad didn't decline those weekend shows even though he promised, especially my senior year, he promised he'd make it, and he didn't. And I know that sounds stupid but that really broke my heart.

Doesn't sound stupid at all. My sister hasn't graduated high school yet but shes taking not going to have that, among other things, pretty hard. 

Also op I've noticed that you have a habit of deliberately undercutting your points."
"I know you’re probably tired of hearing this, but you dodged a MAJOR bullet by not marrying the guy.  

You say he’s done this many times before.  This is teenage behavior, not 30 year old man behavior. I’m going to be harsh: you’re his plan B.  He’s either too immature to commit, doesn’t want to commit, or is screwing around.  He’s making it “easy” for you by ghosting.  Don’t let him back in.  "
"&gt;and convinced I’m the bad guy

I would argue that he's not actually ""convinced"" of this but rather he's laying the groundwork for torpedoing your life. First off, who you talk to as you navigate this difficult situation is none of his business. He caused this situtation, he's controlling it and escalating it, and now he's isolating you while he's *already* staying with a friend who you *know* he's talking to. You don't think he just moved in without giving him a story, do you? Second of all, I would be very surprised if this hasn't already gone past him and this friend, likely by his own doing.

&gt;I don’t know how to contact him

You don't. You contact a laywer to determine how to sever ties. Take what evidence you have with you, explain that he took the car you bought together, and that you're on a lease and need to know if there is a way out of it. Your ex will likely start singing a different tune when a lawyer contacts him instead, but don't contact him anymore. I really don't trust that he isn't trying to build up some fake scenario to make you look bad. Don't play into it."
"Unless this is an elaborate plot to surprise you later by saying “just kidding! We really bought the phone for you!” yeah, what you’re describing is insensitive as hell at best.

Yes, it’s your SM’s money and property and all and technically she can do whatever the hell she wants with it, but just because you *can* act a certain way doesn’t mean you *should*. 

I’m basically your SM’s same age and I have stepkids myself, and I would never do something so low key jerky to them on their birthdays (or any other time, just to be clear). Grow up, lady, and happy birthday to you, OP."

"This is spectacularly rude and it’s sort of funny to me how many comments seem to justify it. 

You planned this for months. 

You don’t travel together often so the dynamic was new. 

It’s rude, period. You do not invite random friends without asking. Heck I have friends that are close with another friend and I’ll still check in (“mind if Mary comes tonight or wanna keep it just us”). 

It doesn’t matter if they’re spontaneous. It’s rude. 

I wouldn’t confront them. I just would never go anywhere with them again. Its not just the actual invitation either; you picked up on how they did not attempt to gauge how you or your partner reacted. They just didn’t care. To me it’s so obvious to ask or check in that the fact that they pushed on, determinedly cheerful, suggests they know it’s not ideal and again: didn’t care and did it anyway. 

These types of people are my least favorite lol. "

"I’d have to real hard time getting past this. And even if I did, I’d be worried that I’d have to deal with her nonsensical bullshit every time I got sick. Who wants to deal with guilting and doubt on top of feeling physically sick? For fuck sake it sounds like you have to be hospitalized for her to believe you? She can kick rocks. "
"...... “he won’t have sex with me even when I am horny because I won’t f*** him how he wants”???????

Leave. This isn’t just unkind. It’s cruel. Get out. He’s trash. No decent person says that to their partner. 

Here’s the worst part OP. You’re willing to engage in sex. You just don’t want to do the “freaky” things he wants. So his answer is to *threaten you* with ultimatums to get his way. *Does that sound consensual to you????* It isn’t. That is not full consent. But does he care? Nah. As long as he successfully pressures you into doing what he likes? Great!

Not great. Gross and sad. Leave or give your own ultimatum: he sees a counselor to find a compromise. 

Don’t agree to what doesn’t work for you. He wants someone he can bully into sexual acts then so be it. But you shouldn’t be that victim. 

This isn’t a case of a man forced to give up his life of sexual pleasures. It’s a man who wants exactly what he wants when he wants is and that isn’t how sex works. "
"He assaulted you. Run, don’t walk, away from him and this relationship. 

The “I’m not good enough for you” is a line that abusers frequently use to generate sympathy for themselves and prevent themselves from being held accountable for their actions. "
He seems pretty immature. What is the relevancy of him having sex with girls to splitting the uber? Might be time to reevaluate your friendship with him.  
"&gt; I know this is a common problem that comes up in relationships

Wrong. Absolutely not true in the slightest. Sure money issues come up, but you don't have money issues you have a leeching, lazy, using boyfriend on your hands. Dump his ass and keep your money to yourself. "
"He's still trying to help, so he doesn't hate you. Seems to me like he is putting distance between you two and you should respect that. Maybe his wife or GF got upset. Or maybe you aren't the first inappropriate prof/student relationship he's been in and someone above him has told him to back off. Either way, he's saying it loud and clear. ""Back off."" "
"Talk about it to anyone you like.   He's told you the script he's using with your mutual friends.  If you don't want that to become accepted, you have to get your version out there right now.

As far as his stuff, box it up and see a lawyer asap.  All of that will quickly become ""proof"" in his narrative against you."
"He probably has fucked up toenails. It runs in my family. Tell him you're prepared for anything, as long as his feet aren't demonically possessed or anything"
"This just in: veteran raid leader in world of warcraft struggles with insecurities and intimacy with women. More breaking news on the way, stay tuned."
"So he is pressuring you into sexual acts you are not comfortable performing, while also ignoring any time you want to have sex with him. I think he may well be setting up a situation to allow him to have an open relationship no matter what. I wonder if you went along with him and did some of the stuff he wanted, would be then say it was bad because he could tell you weren’t into it, or something like that? IDK, it just seems like he won’t meet you in the middle at all."
"Personally, I would meet up with her and see if she is actually sincere or not. If she is honestly remorseful, maybe this situation has been a wake up call for her and shown her that not everyone is constantly afraid of illness like her parents. Maybe she's seen that sometimes people are actually sick and not overreacting to the extreme every time they complain. If she is sorry and feels bad, I think you should apologize for what you said. You admit you said some very nasty things, and, drugged or not, an apology from you for your words is also warranted.

If she is more focused on getting an apology and glossing over how she acted.....I would say dump her. Because she'll just keep up the mean behavior.

Regardless, she should probably get some therapy for herself. I can't imagine growing up in a house where you're getting dragged to doctors constantly for very sniffle or perceived illness, and having your parents tell you they're dying all the time. Or being told you yourself are dying. Either situation would be terrifying for a child. I can imagine that would cause some serious psychological damage to a kid. "
"So your husband has secretly recorded you, has snooped through your phone and he has ""required"" you to end a close friendship? He ""allowed"" you to tell her why?

Your husband is the one with boundary issues."
being tired lowers testosterone which negatively affects sex drive. not many people can work 10 hour days and be a good father and be in the mood for sex.
"I would personally see three problems with this:


* One, when you're among peers, sharing the bill or alternating who pays ensures a sense of equity and fairness. One person constantly paying for everyone implies that the others can't (or won't) pay their fair share. This can create a weird dynamic in group friendships. Picking up the tab once in awhile is a kind gesture. Doing it all the time can verge on insulting.



* Two, it raises concerns about how he budgets. Paying large sums for dinners that no one asked, expected, or wanted him to pay such a sum for makes me wonder if he is irresponsible in other ways financially. 


* Three, shutting down and refusing to talk about it is a relationship red flag in general. "
"I can’t imagine any other explanation. I would cut my losses and not give a damn whether he believes you or not - he’s just deflecting and/or gaslighting you. This person has violated your privacy and your boundaries, and profoundly disrespected you. He doesn’t deserve to be in your life a moment longer. I would also talk to a counsellor to help me process all of this in the aftermath. I’m so sorry he’s done this to you."
"100% agree with this. If you can’t ever move past this then that’s simply something you can’t do. However, given she grew up in a household where she probably endured some trauma from her parents related to over inflation of health problems, I think it’s fair to say that she has some demons that she hasn’t properly addressed and that she unfortunately took out on you. 

If this was a realization to her then you should definitely be straightforward with her and say something to the effect of “this type of thing can’t happen again, and I need to know how you and we are going to work on making sure that it doesn’t”. 

But if she isn’t really sorry and only wants her apology from you (which btw should only be for the language you used) then it’s time to move on. "
"Are you sure the money you both earn is enough to cover the expenses you’re committed to? Ignore the loans for a second. Do you make more than you’re supposed to be paying out?

If the answer is yes, then where is the money going? Is she spending frivolously? If she’s running Uber on the side, it sounds like she’s not a deadbeat and is making extra effort. "
"She would rather go on a trip to NY with her boyfriend than to your destination wedding. Do what you will with that information.

I might be salty because I just spent nearly $1K on a friend's wedding (wasn't even in the wedding party!), but you're essentially asking people to put aside thousands of dollars for your benefit, not theirs. Don't be super surprised if folks aren't down for that."
"I love love LOVE cats. Husband is not a cat person. From the moment we started talking about the future, I always included 2 cats in my vision, with names and everything. He humored me, but time went by, and we were still petless.

Then, one day, he went to the vet. He saw a poster for a kitty for adoption, and she had the name of one of my hypothetical cats! I felt like, since it came from him, we were ready!

Well, baby cats are a pain. She broke stuff, the litter box is smelly, she wakes up if she's hungry, we need to plan ahead if we want to go away for a weekend, and a lot of etc. He complained a lot and it was a learning experience. He will tell to anyone who listens how he's not a cats person, he doesn't love the kitty, just tolerates her and that he feels like a slave, cleaning after a cat.

Then one day he went to the grocery store and got a brush because cat likes to be brushed. Another day he complained I did not fold the blanket the way the cat likes and she looked uncomfortable. He cleared a space in the office because the cat liked to be with him but she had nowhere to lay on.

Anyway, my point: it will take time, but let him initiate. Look for little details, don't expect big gestures. Husband still complains about how cats suck, but then buy a cat tree because ""she doesn't have enough things to play with"". The dog might grow on him, just let him get to it at his own pace.

As a fun fact, my self proclaimed cat-hater husband had a pet adoption day at the office and adopted a 2nd cat. He still says he doesn't love the girls, only tolerates them. But yesterday he got a 2nd brush so the 2nd cat doesn't have to share :).

"Phone addiction is a serious issue these days and it needs the addict to own their shit and deal with it as with any other addiction

I watched my wife go down this path, the phone was the outlet and at its core, she just didn't want to be a wife and a mother anymore

You know what I get that, what I couldn't stand around any longer and accept was her refusal to work on it or discuss it

She went deeper her into her phone as became near catatonic some days as depression was now rampant as you can't escape forever into a screen 

In the end there was nothing left of her to lose

Decide how many more ""I'll tries"" you're giving her before your done



"
People like OP don’t want to escalate because in the back of their head they are afraid that if SO is given a choice he might choose the other woman or breaking up. And if the husband senses this he will keep pushing the boundaries because they think that OP will never leave no matter what happens. 
"Don't confront him, I know you want to, but it won't help anything right now. 

The ball is in your court, you have the full advantage of figuring out what YOU want to do. Once you give that up by confronting him you put him on a level playing field. 

I recommend getting ahold of a divorce attorney, and finding a place to stay that you and you kid can be while you go through the divorce. 

The lawyer will give you your best legal advice, but until then don't give up your advantage. "
"I think this tentatively sounds like a good outcome. She came to you she gave you a full unconditional apology after getting a wake-up call from her therapist.

I would still view this as a red flag to keep an eye on. An apology to smooth things over is easier than a commitment to make permanent change."
"This is a really good answer. The situation is complicated and you explain those complexities really well.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up with parents like that is going to be traumatizing. It's not surprising she has that reaction towards sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

However, she is an adult woman and can't spend the rest of her life throwing her loved ones under the bus because of her childhood. She need to do the work it takes to get past this. If she doesn't, there could be life threatening consequences for the people who rely on her.

&amp;#x200B;

What's she going to do when she has kids? What if the baby gets a high fever? What if her 13 year old's appendix bursts? What if her 16 year old starts wheezing and hyperventilating every time they run when they used to be fine a year ago? Is she going to brush it off and yell at them for making things up? Each of those scenarios could be life threatening. Will she let her children die because her parents were hypochondriacs?

&amp;#x200B;

If I were in OP's shoes, I seriously don't know what I'd do. On one hand, I feel a lot of empathy towards her situation. I also grew up with crazy parents and that has greatly skewed my view on some things. I get it. On the other hand, my parents were the type to yell at me if I was sick or injured. That example about wheezing when you run? That happened to me. I had to beg and plead to go to the doctor. They diagnosed me with exercise induced asthma. My mom told me I was weak and making it up. For 7 years I refused to get treatment for it because she'd accuse me of being weak and a liar each time I tried. Finally, three weeks ago, I got an inhaler. For the first time in 7 years I can work out without hyperventilating.

&amp;#x200B;

Had my condition been more serious or gone on longer, I might have had major consequences. Same thing happened to me when I got appendicitis at 11. They huffed and rolled their eyes, finally took me to the ER after a lot of begging, and, lo and behold, I had to get surgery. So I get where OP is coming from too. I no longer trust them with medical emergencies. I still hold resentment for the amount of pain and discomfort I had to go through.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, it's OP's choice. If he doesn't want to get back together, that's completely understandable. If he does, I also see his perspective. In either case, this girl needs to get serious therapy, both for her own happiness and for the sake of anyone who ever ends up relying on her. Their lives might depend on it."
"&gt;We had a very healthy and happy relationship, our sex life was great, and we were actively planning for the future before this happened.

Respectfully, that's what you thought you had. In reality, there was this whole other side where your SO felt he didn't have 'closure', and that closure is not likely to happen anytime soon now a new life is being brought into the situation.

"um girl your edit is a mess, you straight up buried the lede

if he didn't ""feel good"" about doing it, then why did he do it? your boyfriend is a cheater. he showed you who he is. even in the rare and unbelievable circumstance that he was on dating sites for a year and never contacted a single person, he not only was willing to cheat if the opportunity came up, he was ACTIVELY LOOKING for opportunities to cheat.

"Ugh. It's only been 3 months...too much trouble to pursue. Whatever his issue is, it's not you. A 31-year-old man who behaves this way is a bad bet. He was being rashly unreasonable, and sleeping on the floor of the bride &amp; groom's room on their wedding night? How embarrassing!"
"So his reaction to being angry at his ex is to have sex with her... They have a child together already, they have another one on the way and it's apparent they're still ready to jump into bed together whenever the opportunity arises. If negative situations make them want each other that badly, what happens when things are good?  When they bond over their kids' achievements and milestones? What's your place in this dude's life?  Because you are clearly not his first choice or the one he truly wants or even the one he's devoting his energy to and planning his future with. Why aren't they back together already?  Why don't you just leave them to their misery and dysfunction? You are the odd one out. You are hurting yourself. "
"&gt;Everyone always talks about how when you see your child, you fall in love. I don’t want to sound like an asshole, but I didn’t feel that. I was too busy bordering on a panic attack. 

Just want to say that I can't imagine a single person who'd suddenly be over come with parental love under this situation. A lot of that lafs stuff is bullshit, so don't beat yourself up over it.

Other than that, lawyer up. You don't know what she's been saying to who and things could get rough. She didn't just decide to let you know your kid now, 4 years later, out of the goodness of her heart."
"Please be careful about this; some conversion camps will ‘kidnap’ kids if the parents hire or pay them. You mil might sign your son up without your permission and they might grab him.

It’s not guaranteed to happen and it definitely doesn’t happen in all cases, bolting is keep it in mind and b vigilant for a little while.

I'm having trouble feeling sorry for him when he's had ample time to communicate his issue rather than saving it till the day before. Do your best at enjoying this trip. You're essentially treating yourself, but you deserve this. "
"You aren’t required to have a relationship with your family. 

I’m sorry you felt unheard when you were younger. I might be able to offer some perspective as a parent. I have three kids. My oldest is hyperactive ADHD and my middle one literally never stops talking. I hear him right now talking in his sleep. My youngest is very soft spoken and in a house of pure chaos and noise, it’s hard to hear him. We have to make a conscious effort to not only hear what he’s saying but also to pay attention to him in a house where one kid is also causing problems and the other just talks and talks and talks. It’s easy to forget about the quiet, non problematic one. 
"
"&gt; They say they don’t have a problem with my fiancé as a person but can’t allow another faith to enter our family tree in good conscious. 

Lol oh ok, well I guess it’s fine then and your fiancé has no reason to be offended.

Yeah they really don’t get to have it both ways here. They can’t reject your marriage wholesale and still expect to have a normal relationship with you. They can’t boycott your wedding and leave your fiancé’s family wondering where your side is and expect you to have zero negative feelings about it. 

If you want to choke down your hurt and disappointment in them, that’s your prerogative, but frankly boycotting your wedding is such a massive statement that I don’t think you have much to lose by telling them how this makes you feel. They *should* be uncomfortable with this decision. They should, at minimum, have to face your feelings of rejection and loneliness. That’s a natural and just consequence of their behavior and if they reject you *even more* for being sad about their absence, then I’m afraid they just don’t value the relationship as highly as you do. 

This is nasty and there’s no hiding it. They can make all the religious excuses they want but it won’t cover the stench of bigotry and casual cruelty. There will be consequences for your relationship and they can’t pretend that away. 

"
"&gt; I'm a romantic, and I guess in some ways I feel like I'm not ""the one"" for him because he can't be vulnerable with me. I know this is the wrong way to think 

  

It may help you to reframe this way of thinking about your boyfriend’s vulnerability.

Your boyfriend has never felt comfortable with anyone seeing his feet, or even discussing this issue with anyone. He is not even seeing a therapist. However, he feels safe enough in the relationship to, in a way, remove thin layers from this wall. One is that he trusted you enough to tell you this. Another that might sound minor is that he will go swimming with you with his water shoes, when he doesn’t feel comfortable doing that with most/any other people. His anxiety is irrational and very strong – you do not know how hard it is for him to take even these steps, which to an outsider seem miniscule. 

If you communicate that you think he can’t be vulnerable to you, the effect will be to communicate that the vulnerability he is very likely feeling after coming clean to you did not register to you and will only ‘count’ after the fact, if he overcomes this extremely painful and difficult obstacle. It will be hard for him to accept your support or trust that you really are not judging him.

Generally when you have a partner with mental health issues (as probably most people do to some degree) you want to strike a balance between supporting them and sometimes pushing them to work on themselves, and being a safe, judgment free haven for them (within your communicated boundaries). This is the messy work of love. Right now he has just made a significant step that could be the first of many steps – right now, he needs safety and reassurance from you that he is loved with or without this burden he is carrying. I think you need to give him that until he calms down a little.

In the near future, I would suggest saying something like this (but a lot less formal): “Boyfriend, can you think about how I can best support you working through your anxiety and trauma? I have instincts both to give you space and time but also to encourage you and push you so you can start really healing. I’m not sure what is the right balance. We can take our time to figure it out. I know we don’t have the answers now and we can try different approaches depending on how things end up playing out. I love you and I’m proud of you for voicing this.” 

If you get nowhere putting this in his court, and he just wants space indefinitely and does not take at least baby steps on his own to start working through this, I would explicitly bring up your needs – that it hurts you to sit there and watch him suffer, that it’s unsustainable for you emotionally, that it breaks your heart to know that he is unable to have experiences with people he loves, etc. Seeing a therapist is an important first step that you can help him with."
"He does. And it matters a lot to him too - he both wants to provide for us to make sure we're financially safe (I'm a photographer and work as a freelancer so I have a lot of ups and downs) and also has a lot of pride/insecurity issues with being financially successful.   
His dad was a major workaholic and was NEVER present at home, was emotionally distant, but was super successful in his career and I feel like my husband needs to ""make him proud"" by being the most financially successful among his siblings, since he has major rejection issues relating to his parents (very blatantly) preferring the older children (he has an older sister, mom's favorite, and an older brother, dad's favorite).   
So yes, he works A LOT. He is frequently tired and stressed. "
"This seems like the nicest approach.  They are your parents and family IS important.  So, be kind and gentle, yet firm, as you tell them that you value your relationship with them too much to risk it by mixing in business.  Emphasis on valuing the relationship, if that feels genuine to you."
"Hi OP. i came into your post fully expecting to side with you and say their behavior is inappropriate, because 9/10 on this sub, with a title like yours, it usually is inappropriate. But after reading your post and considering all of the factors combined; her depression, her father, she's close to you and your bf... I honestly think you can let this one go in my eyes.

Personally, I've told male and female friends when drunk that I love them. It's a kind gesture of comradery. We've all seen those comedy movies where the two drunk male buddies say ''you know I love you man''. Regardless of gender, this can happen, and i love you can be said in this manner.

The carrying out of the car seem's threatening at a glance, sure, but she was black out smashed and couldn't walk. I highly doubt this was a ploy to get close or get affection from your bf, I genuinely think she just couldn't walk because she was too drunk.

I get their closeness on the couch is a little disturbing. I wouldn't like this one bit if my bf of 8 years was letting a drunk girl put her head in his lap. But this woman is your close friend, to the both of you. And she was presumably going through a crisis. If your bf was smashed too, then he may have been feeling highly empathetic to her. Not romantic. And to elaborate, if this was an ordinary drunken night where everything in your friends life was fine, and she didn't have depression, then yeah, i'd be asking questions like you are... But you've got to consider the factors here, she's grieving hard, she has heavy depression, she was extremely drunk which doesn't help these negative thoughts. 

I think this one's innocent, and I wasn't expecting that. So a few questions, have you ever felt suspicious of their relationship prior to this? is your bf the type to cheat or lust after other women? could you be seeing thing's clearly as you'd just woken up and were still probably in a somewhat altered state of consciousness? Is there any other cause for you to feel uneasy here besides seeing what you saw, which as i've said above, can be explained/excused. I just wanted to finish by saying i totally understand your unease, it's valid, it's not crazy or wrong, it's a default natural reaction.

But i think you can safely assume your bf was being compassionate for this situation. You sound like a fantastic friend, and you should invite her over to watch ferris buelers day off. "
Tell them that you have a policy to not mix business and family but will gladly refer them to somebody you trust to help them.
"There is not a compromise if kids are your hardlimit. 
She either reevaluates how badly she wants kids, or you divorce."
"\&gt; I want to hook up with you  
\&gt; I'm going to hook up with you  
\&gt; why are you with your wife? what benefit could you possibly see in marriage, when you could be out boning women every weekend?

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; haha yeah maybe let's not be left alone together baby, never know what could/will happen!

&amp;#x200B;

Like, this is literally the message exchange you've stumbled upon. And he's brushing you off while reaching out for her. Escalate it so he realises he needs to shut it down, for the sake of his entire marriage, if he still values it."
"I agree with this. A serious illness can really put life in perspective and actually be a positive catalyst for a constructive talk. No bullshit, remember to have compassion and say your piece, OP. I had a few tough talks with my sick parent before they passed, and I'm incredibly grateful I did. I wish I were braver and asked about even more.

Edit: 8 days later.... it's ""say your piece"" not ""peace"". Embarrassing."
"I am now and old woman but I left a very sheltered religious environment at 18 and has so little knowledge and experience of the world I am shocked I didn't get myself into serious trouble. 

Of course if he asks a basic factual questions, you aren't brainwashing him by giving him the answer. But other stuff, it's ok to say ""This is what I think and here's why, but you'll need to do your own research and make your own opinion.""

It's damn hard to be out of such a restrictive sheltered environment and needing to have opinions and stuff when you are still catching up on music and movies and what normal people wear and even eat. 

And he probably really could benefit from therapy."
"Age appropriate truth. That love exists, that it sometimes mean you don't end up together forever but you can be great friends and that sometimes mommy and daddy will find someone else. Explaining that friendship is an important form of love too, keep showing that with your ex to make him feel safe. He's just trying to make sense of his world, he doesn't need to know all details of your relationship. But acknowledging that his world might be a li'l different from his friends and that that's okay will help him. 

If you're still so angry with your ex after so many years, maybe see if you need to address it. So your kid doesn't get the sense that you're lying to him if caught unaware. You don't have to hug her, just not look at her with anger and disgust."
This isn't your battle to fight.  It's your brother's  He needs to tell his wife that there is no harm in your tradition (and that's what it is) and that she needs to lay off.  HE needs to lay down the ground rules.  He needs to tell her that she won't be invited to family things if she keeps spoiling their fun.
"My husband quit kissing, touching, even talking to me other than necessity after having our daughter. My therapist said it's very common. Something about equating you to their own mother .. whatever that is about. He said it's sometimes hard for men to see their wives as a sexual being after baby because they see them as ""mother"".. Its not something I was able to deal with sadly. Maybe therapy would be good for him to move past that.  (You too!) "
God damn she sounds crazy. Glad you’re finally moving forward!
"My husband had major emergency surgery a little over two weeks ago.  I spent almost every moment at the hospital with him and covered his every request.  When those hospital hours dragged on, I suggested we play cards or go for another walk around the floor.  Since he’s been home, I’ve prepared all his meals, helped with all of his showers, called the doctor at the slightest concern, helped arrange his medical leave from his job, and made sure he’s taken his meds every day.  We also have two kids I’ve been either figuring out care for them or caring for them myself.

I do this not to be a martyr or because I don’t have anything better to do, but because I love him.  Because I want, more than anything, for him to be ok and to be proactive with his recovery.  I do this because I know, if things were swapped, he’d do the same for me.

We had a strong relationship before, but this has only made us closer.  To know that when the sh*t really hits the fan, the other person is really there for you.

Your boyfriend has shown you nothing but selfishness and verbally abusive behavior.  Let your aunt take care of you and heal well.  When you are better, you need to break up with him.  If there is ever a time for him to be there, it was now, and he totally failed.  What if this was recovering from having a newborn?  He can’t park a baby in front of a TV.  He needed to step up, he didn’t, he showed you what is really important to him, and, unfortunately, it’s not you.  You are worth way way more than that."
"It doesn't sound like you've lost much of a support network if your parents would stand by and allow your brother to butt his nose into something that's none of his business. 

Your boyfriend has nothing to apologize for, and he did exactly the right thing. Please don't be bullied into breaking up with what sounds like the one supportive person in your life. I'd be looking to put more distance between you and your family and start building healthy relationships and building ""family"" connections with people who will actually have your back.

You did nothing wrong and there is nothing for you to fix. They all owe you and your BF an apology."
Your 22. The world is full of men who haven't cheated on you and gotten someone else pregnant. 
"Yeah, my first thought was to take him out of the wedding--don't let him make a speech (because it will disappoint OP no matter what), don't have him walk you down the aisle, don't do a first dance with him. 

I would also definitely talk with the parents about why they were treated differently growing up--and the sister too, since she never seemed to notice. 

There are also potentially logistical reasons as to why things happened the way they did, so I would give the parents a chance to speak, but I don't think that would change that they doesn't deserve a spot in OP's wedding."
"My mom does this thing where she tells everyone in our family and anyone around us, how shy she thinks I am. Unfortunately for her, many people in my life have rejected that statement to her face, saying I’m not at all shy to them. She always acts shocked. She’s never been able to understand that I’m just introverted. Perfectly happy in my own space. You are viewing him from your own lens and assigning all kinds of unhappy emotions to how you think his life looks. 


u/gobsofficemagic has a wonderful comment below which I wish someone had said to my mother decades ago.  "
"You two don't sound compatible, which is ok. That is the whole point of dating! After one year, you are no longer feeling supported and uplifted by this relationship, which means it's time to end it. You don't have to accuse her of anything or be angry, you just need to tell her that the two of you are not compatible.

There are plenty of women out there who drink very little and would love to have a quieter life with you taking walks in the woods instead of partying all night. Find one of them to be with :-)"
I find myself wondering how innocent Ellie really is in this whole equation...
"This just absolutely made my heart ache. I can’t even believe what I just read. I am so sorry for what you went through, this is just awful on so many levels. What you have experienced is abandonment and neglect, which can wreak havoc on your relationships later in life. But it seems like you have found the love of your life so I am happy that you are getting married and can start your own family, with a man who will be a wonderful father to your children - all your children! Honestly I would not have my dad speak at my wedding and instead ask my mom or brother if you have that option. Your dads speech will just make you cry and put your in a sour mood at your wedding, and you don’t want to risk that. "
"You were excited to go on this trip, and yet the first thing you mention before even making it past city limits is your hot neighbor.  To make him jealous?

To what end?  Examine your process.  Why the hell would you do that?"
This so much! Lying to your parents is an important survival skill for Asian kids.
"That guy was never your friend, just a predatory little shit looking for the right moment to strike. Go see the subreddit niceguys, he has comrades. You have not done anything wrong. If he tries to bring this up at work, go straight to HR or a manager and let them know. "
Divorce was the closure. What a bullshit excuse. 
"&gt; He said his mom wouldn't let him

You can’t plan a life with someone that thinks he needs his mother’s permission to make decisions. 

Holidays when you’re in a relationship are hard. If it’s your first serious partner (so the first time you’re both skipping holidays that your family is used to you attending every year), it’s extra hard. Parents tend to want their children with them for every holiday that is important to them. You have to navigate that together as a team, with each partner communicating &amp; standing behind your team decisions to their own family. Sometimes, you can visit one family on a Christmas Eve &amp; the other on Christmas Day; sometimes, you have to alternate by years which family gets all of Christmas. It depends on how far away everyone is &amp; which holidays are more important to each family. But the thing is that you have to decide together as a couple how to split them up. “My mom says we have to do this” isn’t how you have an adult relationship. "
I think your partner is being wildly unreasonable and actually wants to punish you for embarrassing him. 
"Damn, I could've used this advice two years ago when I was 20 "
"Because brains are weird and dreams are weird. I've literally dreamed about cheating on my BF *with my BF*. Like, I'm making out with ""Jeff"" in the dream and thinking ""Man, I hope Jeff doesn't find out."""
"You need to have a serious conversation with your husband and make it clear that if he wants a life with you, he needs to prioritize you and your needs first. Why the fuck isn't the fact that you are having issues in the marriage an issue to him? Because if you're having issues in the marriage that aren't getting solved by working together, the other solution is to just leave the marriage. I'm sure separation or divorce would be an issue for him if that happened, right? 

Your husband doesn't seem to give that much of a shit about your feelings and it may be time for the ""two-card"" solution. You give him a business card for a couples therapist and a divorce lawyer and he decides which one he wants to go to. I don't this can be solved without couples counseling."
"It seems like they're trying to sabotage your relationship with your half-brother. When you first initiated contact with him two years ago, did they resist the idea? Did they ever tell you why they don't like him?"
"If I asked my SO to stay with me because I had neck pain so bad that I couldn't breathe I would feel SO betrayed if they left. Your reaction is 100% justified. Her first reaction should have been concern for you. In a normal reaction, she should have asked if you wanted her to bring you to the hospital. I get that her past makes it difficult for her to be empathetic in situations like this but she needs individual therapy to figure that out. Imagine if she ever had kids and she didn't believe them when they felt ill... that would be considered neglect. "
"It is totally OK to recognize that your mother was unfair to you. 

&gt;I don't know how to let this go and just move on with my life without letting this keep eating me away and making me into a miserable, angry person.

I think therapy, and most of all, the passage of time. But honestly, stories like this are why I have come to believe in french inheritance laws, in which children can't be disinherited (without serious legal reasons).

"This dude is a poor investment for an adult life partner.

"At this point, I would recommend couples counseling because otherwise, I can see this turning into toxic resentment."
"On behalf of every kid whose parents were in failing marriages but stayed together because they thought it would be better for their children to be in a home with two parents who were miserable rather than in two homes with parents who are happy and working well as co-parents: fuck that thought process sky-high. 

I'd bet your libido is slipping because you're married to a selfish ass who doesn't think your needs are important.
"
"&gt; she basically left you to fend for yourself

As far as he knew, she called him a liar, left him to die, and is making this about herself by focusing at all on the apology she feels entitled to. 

I would be SO BEYOND PISSED it's hard to imagine. At first, I was sympathetic to her because that kind of upbringing can mess someone up, but she was so arrogantly selfish by the back half I don't know.





When OP is up to it and if he wants to try to work it out, he needs to have a come to Jesus meeting with her where he makes her understand:

* This was 1,000% not okay and is at minimum an orange flag.
* As far as he knew, she left him to DIE in excruciating pain
* She was more upset at missing an event than in her partner's health
* She called him a liar
* After the fact, she made it about her and was mad that he didn't call her instead of asking how he was doing after finding out the story
* She has the sheer audacity to say ""sorry I abandoned you, insulted you and left you to die but you need to apologize for saying a bad word while under doctor-mandated chemical influence""

There are clear signs to her true, SELFISH, ARROGANT nature. This is not just a misunderstanding in isolation. 

AT A MINIMUM, he needs to demand she get counseling for whatever issues her hypochondriac parents gave her, and regardless of any of that, she needs to react as if she believes him about not feeling well even if she doesn't feel it emotionally right away. Otherwise, you cannot have a relationship with this person. 

Let's think long term. As we get older, health declines. Will she think he is lying any time something happens? What if they have kids? Will she delay getting their children medical care because she thinks they are making it up?

This is so much more serious than ""my GF wasn't nice and I used bad language, haha sorry for the misunderstanding.""  This is SERIOUS shit to sort out now before you build a life with someone, or there could be really bad consequences. "

You've only known him for 3 months. Now you're seeing the real him, the person that he is when things don't go his way.

"The comments on the original about ""Detroit's black market organ harvesting"" were a bit over the top but hey, who knew."
"All I could think whilst reading this is 'good for her'. Let her go, she likely fully checked out of this relationship months ago. If you couldn't be what she needed in 7 years of marriage then counseling wont change anything. Stop wasting her time and let her be happy. "
"Wow thank you very much for this, that's exactly how I feel. "
"I wouldn’t even give $20 tbh. I would tell your boss it is not in your budget to contribute. They can’t force you to pitch in and you’re leaving soon

I understand the desire to get answers for how she is treating you, but I don’t think you will ever get a satisfying answer. I don’t think she even knows why, she probably just finds something about you threatening to her (not physically but  emotionally). She sounds very emotionally and socially immature, people like that don’t usually understand themselves very well. Your assessment that she hates you cus you don’t give her attention is probably more accurate than any excuse she will come up with to justify her behavior. 

If you must ask her about it tho I’d wait till the very last minute possible (end of the day your last day if possible) . Jumping the gun and asking 3 weeks out could have consequences you’re not aware of yet. Better be safe than sorry on that imo. 

Edit: it is also incredibly unprofessional of your boss to make a decision on the gift before seeing a budget. The first step should have been asking who wants to contribute to a gift, next step is deciding with those people what their budget to contribute is, THEN once they have a budget decide what to get. Honestly this situation is ridiculous and I’d be super pissed "
This guy is a scrub! He is definitely using you . I think it’s completely inappropriate for his kids to come over that often and trash your place. You should not allow his kids over UNLESS they (and him) clean your place after. If they can’t do that then they have to hang out at their dad’s place. It’s pretty gross that he hasn’t cleaned his place in 1.5 years. Do you really want to be with a man who doesn’t have basic adult skills like budgeting and cleaning? 
"Ive met alot of high earners who have a messy credit situation.  You dont have to pay for them.  Help if you wish, but please realize you dont need to.

80% chance OP’s bf has cloven hooves. 
"I don't understand this at all.  Your husband is carrying on at work with another woman so blatantly that others are commenting about it and you are afraid to ""upset"" him?

You don't need another discussion about his cheating on you (and that is what it is), you need to stop being a doormat and remove his safety net right now.  Get some references for lawyers and make at least two appointments for consultations (often they will give you a short consultation for free).   

You should also get yourself into counseling because your willingness to accommodate his behavior is very troubling.  There can be no middle ground when it comes to infidelity and he is definitely being unfaithful to you. 

Then prepare for a big ""upset"".  Tell him that he has to shut down his inappropriate relationship with his co-worker or get out ...and mean it.  Let him know that you have already arranged to see a lawyer and you want him to leave.  He has to shut it down -- no texting, no flirty touching, no lunches, NOTHING.  He should also seek counseling himself to understand why he would even want to be married with such porous boundaries.

Do your calling today and tomorrow then have the fight over the weekend.  When he leaves for work on Monday, it should either be with a suitcase or a new attitude.  Do not back down... this is definitely a case where you have to be prepared to lose your marriage to save it."
"Shocker. It sounds like the idea excited you at first because girl on girl was just a kink to you. Now you’re realizing that your girlfriend’s sexuality is more than just “hot lesbian sex porn irl” but that she’s actually attracted physically and emotionally to women in the same way that she’s attracted to you as a man, and that’s threatening to you. It’s not unfair that you feel that way, but a good reason why these things need to be discussed at length and not dived into just because 2 girls kissing is hot. 

Talk to her and tell her how you feel. As her boyfriend, her top concern should be your feelings, maybe this plan isn’t going to work out like you both thought and that’s okay. But if she feels that she needs to be involved with other women still, and you can’t find a way to be completely comfortable and happy with that, then maybe you guys aren’t compatible. "

"My brother said the same thing to my husband when we were dating. He told him that I was “toxic and crazy”. It sucks because I have done so much for my brother and his family. We gave him the down payment for his first house, we flew down for a week when his daughter had spine surgery so him and his wife could work and we watched her while she recovered. I finally just cut them all off. It’s hard because I would like to share things with my family but the drama and pain they cause isn’t worth it. "
"Yikes, your brother sounds like he’s taking the place of the abuser. I don’t know your family’s whole dynamic but you deserve better than that. I hope you have a good support system outside of them and keep developing healthy relationships (like what your boyfriend seems to be).

The abuse you suffered is not your fault and in no way “tarnishes” you or prevents you from experiencing new and better relationships. Idk what your brothers deal is but low key he can fuck off, you’re doing great."
"Also, dollars to donuts he wants “space” because he is full-bore trying to make the other girl official, and if that falls through he will suddenly work harder to fix it. I hope you consider this relationship over."
"So his aim, from the very beginning, was to drag you down? You need out of this relationship. "
"You're only 22, it's not too late.  "
I think you’ll be better off living apart and being single. The relationship is not healthy and you know it.

"&gt;But I read online that neglected wives who nag and criticize only make things worse, and that the walkaway wife thing can still be fixed. How? I'd love to fix this, and I don't want to file for divorce, but I don't know how else to wake him up.

I mean, this is a situation where an ultimatum is 100% appropriate. People often hate the idea of ""throwing around"" ultimatums, but the thing is, if you're ready to walk then you aren't throwing it around. You're giving him a fair warning that the end of the marriage is on the table. 

Lay out for him what you've said here, all of it. And don't pre-emptively dismiss yourself as ""nagging and criticizing."" Wanting to have a bare minimum fulfilling sex life with your partner isn't a nagging demand. Even if you and your husband have a fundamental incompatibility, that doesn't mean your needs aren't valid."
"No, you didn’t do anything wrong. That is absolutely a sanitary issue and not good at all! You did the right thing by informing people who could potentially be harmed by the bugs, especially since I’m assuming your mother and sister will be doing the cooking for thanksgiving (Yuck! I wouldn’t wanna eat somewhere where my cook was exposed to a bug infestation!). 

I’d personally even consider contacting CPS for your nephew. This can’t be healthy for him to be covered in bites and I shudder to think about the possibility of him getting sick. Either way, if your sister can’t keep her house clean enough to prevent and is unwilling to solve the bug infestation problem she cannot provide a safe living environment for your nephew to grow up in. It’s an upsetting thing to think about but it may be the best thing for him. 

Best of luck to you! "

"I would talk to your mother. Gather the evidence and go to the police. This could constitute harassment and or stalking. Please see what they say.

Edit:  yes sorry, I meant mother as your adoptive mother. She is your real mother. Block the one who gave birth to you. "
"Not to make this situation worse but you believe that a stripper, whose job it is to only tease men, tried to unzip his pants IN A CLUB while he was super drunk?  For a free blowjob? Either someone paid for that in advance or you aren't being told the truth. "
"&gt; Q: Does Bob have a crush on you? 

&gt; A: This question came up surprisingly often

Not surprising to me.


&gt;  but yes Bob had asked me out shortly after we first met, but I declined. I've since gotten engaged to a lovely woman. I don't know if romantic feeling was what motivated a surprise late night birthday visit after four months of radio silence but I guess I wouldn't rule it out. 

If I were I betting man, I would bet on it. 

Tell him you accept his apology and it doesn't have to be in person.

"Why would you want to be only married once when it's to someone you're hardly in a relationship with? You're dating other people. You're looking to officially get your own place. You're not talking about personal stuff. Just get a divorce. Divorce isn't awful, but staying in a marriage like this is."
"&gt; My fiancé and I considered having a ceremony with just us to avoid me feeling more alone/reminded of the situation with his MASSIVE family all there but I didn’t want to deprive his family of their sons wedding so we’re moving forward.

So, regarding this...consider the fact that while your parents are being awful to you, you're *gaining* a family that's welcoming you with open arms.  You do not need a family that won't accept your spouse."
"Based on this, your posts about how he was still married when you started dating, and post about how poorly his son treats your son, I think you need to end this relationship. Put your son first. He doesn’t deserve to be mistreated by his potential step sibling. Also, put yourself first. You don’t deserve to be lied to and taken advantage of. "
BF knows; BF does not care.
"I did, he said it was too expensive and we should just forget it."
On the upside at least you can live with the comfort of knowing your sister will shoulder the burden of caring for your dad when he is older. You are 100% exempt from providing anything but some minor passive assistance. May not sound that great but you'll appreciate the freedom of having no responsibility to him when he reaches that stage.
"Sounds like he likes having you isolated, so that you have no idea or context about how shitty and abusive he is.  Abuse comes in many shapes and forms:  this is emotional abuse."
If she's into you enough to confront bad decisions she's made based on familial hang-ups she's worth sticking with. Happy for you!
"Yes to all of this. I used to nanny, and dad-boss couldn't understand why mom-boss hadn't wanted his mother there to 'help' when they had their kids, because his mother had had his gran come. Mom-boss was like, ""Yes. HER mother. She wanted HER mother. Not your dad's."" Took four years after the fact for the penny to drop for him. OP needs to put her foot down ASAP that HIS mentally unstable mother will not be a help or comfort to her. "
Your comment hit the nail on the head. I don't have proof but I suspected he was cheating throughout. He's cheated in past relationships.
Honestly I would split. This sounds like a disaster. :( I’m so sorry you’re having to go through this. 
"Honestly, it sounds like they have been planning to use you as a piggy bank for a while.  They bought an expensive car in that expectation.  Stop subsidizing their irresponsible spending, ignore any and all  requests for money.   If they bring it up in telephone calls, tell them no then hang up.   

Get insurance in your own name and proceed with your program of paying of your student loans.   Do not get involved in their finances as all -- no more volunteering with budgeting, etc.  Life it your life as responsibly financial and  send them a copy of Dave Ramsey's book to help them learn on their own."
Maybe focusing on getting her to take down the post now (let her know that it's reopening the wound every time you see it) and talk about her motivations for posting it after you get home. You don't have to solve this right this second. 
"Hold on. You’re totally cool with the fact that he attempted to cheat on you multiple times and the only reason he didn’t was because he didn’t have takers, but you’re drawing the line because he didn’t disclose something that happened before the relationship started? *That* is the lie you can’t handle?"
If it wasn't a big deal and he was just bored he would've let you see the messages. 
Your BF is an asshole. This won’t change. DTMFA and get a better boyfriend. 
"Honestly? I think you need to get out of that house for a month or so.  Your SO has no incentive to solve any of these problrms while you keep taking care of everything.

If you left today, your SO would have to take care of her kids, deal with her friend, etc...

Isn't it time that you put your needs first?

Edited to add: Tell your SO that you need a break from this life.  Taking care of her friend, all the kids, etc..  has worn you out. She needs to decide who is more important to her."
"“that commission is worth more than family”

I mean they're the ones that are making commission mean more than family. "
"So here’s a metaphor for you. You know that kid in school that skipped a ton of classes, never turned in his homework, failed his pop quizzes, didn’t study for his exams... &amp; then was camped out in the teacher’s classroom the day before grades were finalized saying stuff like, “You’ve gotta let me do some extra credit! You can’t fail me! I didn’t even know I was failing! You have to let me make it up!”

That kid is you, in your marriage. You ignored all of the signs that you were failing, &amp; now that the grades have been finalized, you’re begging for a chance to retake an exam or complete some extra credit. Your wife is the teacher saying, “You had chances all semester to do what was expected, but now it’s too late.”"
"&gt;  I will have lost my support network

What support network? Your family? They couldn't support a pair of tits if they were made into a bra.

Your boyfriend is not the problem here, do not break up with the only person in this situation who has your back. Your family wants him to be the problem because you are stronger with him, and they don't like that so they want him gone.

DO NOT GIVE IN. You've got this."
"It appears that they are punishing you for having a relationship with your half brother. I’m so sorry, that’s really shitty."
True. I smoke regularly. Have for 20 or so years. And I buy once a month (cheaper in bulk). But if there is ever a decision between the weed or fun stuff with my SO it's an easy choice. 
"German woman here. I would NEVER talk to other people about my boyfriend's penis size - no matter if it's small, medium or large. Not even after the relationship is over. Penis size is 100% private information. Ask your girlfriend how she would feel if you suggested in front of other people that she should get a breast enlargement in Morocco.

By the way:

sensible = vernünftig

sensitive = sensibel"
If you can't forgive her then you can't forgive her. There is nothing wrong with ditching a relationship because of a lack of empathy. It really doesn't matter why she has this problem - that's for her to deal with. What she has shown you quite clearly is that you cannot trust her to have your back with things get rough. 
"I would break up with him. You're doing all the work, and he's gotten so used to it. He's blowing money on weed and takeout and can't plan a picnic for you he knew about well in advance. For your birthday....I think it's time to cut this cord.

"OP, please stand up for what you believe and your husband. Every time you go over to your parents' house pretending nothing happened is a slap to his face.

Tell them they are not very Christian. The Old Testaments commands his people to welcome sojourners. Obviously they are not welcoming."
"Not the same, but I feel like this may be relevant. 

I was a totally awkward, outcast teenager, and after realizing that I was surrounding myself with absolute asshole kids, I quit my friend group, which left me completely alone starting high school. 

And I met a boy. And he was equally as awkward as me. And we clicked and became fast friends.  We talked all night long, stretching phone cords from the kitchen into the bedroom and we made crazy plans for our future. We never had an official romantic relationship, but we teetered on the edge for nearly 2 years. He was my rock, and my soul mate and I loved him very deeply.

On November 20, 2000 he was struck by a car while walking to school and he died. And I was absolutely devastated. Crushed. 

This year will be 18 years since his death. On that day every single year I cry with as much anguish and heartbreak as I did on day he died.

I am a 33 year old woman and I cry loudly and terribly for a love I had at 15 years old. Crazy, huh?  Love is a strange beast. 

This is what I can say:

For 8 years I was married to man who never mentioned my grief to me when I was sad, not once.  I imagine it’s because it made him uncomfortable. 

He didn’t want to know about my lost love because he felt like it somehow affected my love for him (I know this because we spoke about it after our divorce-which happened for other reasons). In turn, I became resentful of him, and on the anniversary of my friend’s death I always isolated myself to grieve alone. 

Conversely, I’ve now been dating a wonderful man for nearly a year who has ASKED me about my friend and LISTENED to my stories openly and I would now invite to accompany me while I go about my yearly “ritual” on the anniversary of his death.

And I’ll tell you, it feels totally different now. I want to include him because he wants to be included. And I can already tell that this year will feel different. I will still cry, because the pain feels very real when I’m remembering my friend.  But having someone who offers to share your pain, and carry your grief is beautiful. 

So here’s my 2 cents:

-Hearing that she loved him must feel very painful to you, but it doesn’t mean she loves you any less for it. Her grief is not about you. It’s about her and what she’s lost. 

-I think it’s time that you sat down with your wife and let her tell you the story of how they fell in love.  Again, please understand that she doesn’t love you any less because she loved him, but it was a part of her life that ended literally right in front of her eyes and before she was ready for it to end.  Acting like it never happened will continuously isolate your wife as the years pass- Because I promise you, this time of year will ALWAYS be painful for her.  Offering to learn about their relationship is offering to help her carry the grief.  

-Don’t tell your wife I said this, but because I’m writing this 18 years later, I’ll tell you a little something I’ve realized: Death sensationalizes a person. Death makes us forget all the bad things and remember all the good things in a way that makes it better than any other good.  You will never change this. But it doesn’t make your relationship with your wife any less special, or any less good.  Learn about this man from the eyes of your wife and appreciate him as she does. Share her pain when she has it.  I mean, If she was willing to spend her life with the both of you, he probably was a pretty stand-up guy.  But most of all you’ll be offering your support to HER. 

-Developing a ritual on the anniversary of his death might be something to talk about doing together. Maybe they had a favorite restaurant or a favorite place they liked to go.  As for me, Every year I go to the place where he died, I sit on the ground and drink a Jone’s cream soda (we used to buy them together). I leave one there for him and I light a candle.  It’s a small gesture, and it takes 30 minutes, but it makes me feel better. 

-Some of this behavior might change if you let her know that you’re willing to listen to her and learn about her fiancée, but if your wife is honestly acting like he never existed, I’d recommend therapy. She was WITH HIM when he died. Who knows what she saw? What she heard?  She may be carrying some very dark memories that she needs help sorting through. 

I hope some of this helps. Good luck to you. 

After feeling my own for all these years, I cannot imagine her pain.  Give your wife a hug from me. 

*edit* A word. "
"That is the thinking of an abuser. If he genuinely thought you were too arrogant, he could have walked away and dated someone more humble. Instead, he got into a relationship with you and made it his goal to tear your self-esteem down to where he thought it should be.

You're not overreacting. This is fucked up and unloving behaviour. Your SO should be a person who builds you up, not tears you down. "
"I was gonna say, this sounds very similar to a girl I used to see.  She did things like this and then tried to act like I was the one with the problem. It's not a cultural thing, this girl is just bad news. "
"I find that your husband's outlook is wholesome and the correct way to live life. But, that doesn't mean it is always the best thing to do.

I think your perspective is correct and it is more self-preservation and doing what needs to be done as to minimize bad things (your family) happening to good people (you and your husband).

Maybe figure out a way to have your husband experience the toxic infrastructure of your family without it impacting your lives so he sees that it isn't lying, just withholding information that your family isn't mature enough to digest."
"Let this one lie. He apologized and isn’t acting petty or resentful the next day, meaning he heard you and agreed and is not dwelling on it. He isn’t brining the console so problem resolved.

Not everyone has the initial emotional reaction as we would like. It is their concrete actions and later emotions, having had time to process, that really matter. 

Show him some patience and faith on this one. Doesn’t sound like he’s a bad guy or that this is a red flag, just a one time misunderstanding and difference in unsaid expectations. "
"I haven't responded to any texts for some time, I'm blocking new numbers and archiving the messages. I know about her visa situation, she is limited in how long she can stay here to 6 months, although of course she could apply for another. I'm hoping the fact that she came all this way without seeing me and that I clearly don't want to see her will be the final nail, but we'll see. As I said in another reply, I've already involved the police, although they weren't particularly helpful"
"I feel like you need to go to therapy and stop being so involved in everyone else’s crazy. It’s too much. And you can’t save everybody else while swimming backwards in a sea of shit.

Focus on you, stick to your no contact decision re your sister (you already sound like you might walk that back). Oh and protect your husband a bit more from all the crazy"
"Way to bury the lede. This isn't about food, this is about the lack of respect for boyfriend had for you. He's an asshole. Also, frankly he sounds like a psycho based on those texts. "
This! Be mindful of her position and don't use this as a way to hold the relationship hostage. Be supportive and if/when the time comes that you are no longer happy just tell her that you can't stay because you had feelings for Chris but do not feel the same about Christine. They are different people *from the perspective of a partner* even if they are the same in other aspects.
"You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. If she wants to live with the kid, move out. The fact that you don't trust your girlfriend to tell you the truth about a variety of things means you shouldn't be dating/living with her anyway. "
I would stop by r/JUSTNOMIL Read some stories and cross post there. They are really helpful with setting boundaries and giving advice. 
"&gt;You: You can’t DATE OTHER PEOPLE.”

&gt;Him: “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”

Literally all he had to do was clarify one thing and he decides to just peace out of the conversation?"
"OP, don't even *try* to figure out his motivations, just block him EVERYWHERE. A guy who could dump you like that after a year of happiness can never be trusted again. I know you want there to be some way out of this because you guys were happy together, but I posit that you were happy with his facade. The real guy is the one who randomly dumped you in a really cruel way and refused to explain it. "
"I think the bit that they have to realize is its not that you mind giving them the friends and family discount, but rather the opportunity cost of the lost time. If the market was slow, then maybe it would be a different matter. And sure _some hours_ answering questions.... well, that's family. But to represent them and do all the usual REA work for nothing in a hot market, that's asking a lot. Its not like you're saying no to an afternoon to help them move, they're asking you to sacrifice two weeks of your time. 

Maybe they just don't understand how much time they're asking of you. Give them an example. Write down all of the questions they've already asked and guestimate how much time you've spent providing answers. 60-80 hrs to me probably equates to 2-3 other full commissions right? That's literally your income for the month. Suggest if they can match that, then sure.

"I think what happened here is that you both are growing up, and she did you the favor--yes, it IS a favor--of recognizing that the two of you aren't compatible anymore. There are incredible changes that occur in the four years between 17 and 21, and it sounds like she changed in a different direction than you have."
"&gt; Also op I've noticed that you have a habit of deliberately undercutting your points.

Yeah, a few people have pointed that out. I guess, that nasty, mean voice in my head has been making all these points for decades, but the self-preserving part of my brain always undercuts them and reassures me. I guess it's time to come to terms with the fact that they're true :/"
"Hijacking the top comment to also say, I'm sure OP has already talked to her son and the bf about this, but to have a sit-down conversation where you tell him ""We are on your side. Please tell us about anything like this as soon as possible. For your own safety."" I'm just a little concerned that he felt like he had to wait to tell his mom about this."
"&gt;Maybe we can be friends again 

No, OP."
"I couldn’t say it better myself if I tried. A father who blatantly treated one of the two daughters in his life like she was worth less than his other. Well I believe @DankJemo is right personally I wouldn’t want him to speak on my behalf at my wedding. I know it hard but if there is a part of you who wishes to confront your father on this, you should.

Edit: (I just saw you talking about your mother’s brain tumor, Im very sorry to hear that and know it may seem insignificant and petty. Please talk to her about this your father wasn’t the only one involved in this blatant favoritism and you’ll never have an answer otherwise.)"
"Oh man! This hits home with me so hard. When my golden child brother and his girlfriend broke up, my mom was pissed because the ex talked shit about her. She kept going on and on about how she treated her like a daughter. Like lunch, shopping, mani-pedis, things she never had time to do with me. I listened to that bullshit for twenty minutes. I looked at her and asked her if it ever occurred to her to treat her daughter like a daughter. "
See your mom a day or two before and then have Christmas just the two of you at home. Both are happy.  The drive isn’t that bad 
"I also think ""wouldn't leave all weekend to make sure I wouldn't change my mind"" isn't 100% great. If OP had wanted some space to still be mad or feel his feelings, that would have been ok for him to expect. It seems like she was almost demanding forgiveness once she realized she was in the wrong and apologized."
"Thank you, I will do that."
"This is why moving a teenager you barely know, with no job and no life experience, into your home is a bad idea.

Give her notice to move out, unless you want to keep being her parent."
" No logic here. 3 years of an empty sister's room and only doing the DDD with her on her sister's senior year, then not making the effort for another 2 years looks bad.(not even making much of an effort for your first is bad enough)  Its sounds like he was in the position to decide if he could work or not those days since during his big speech he mentioned that he ""could have done shows but turned them down for his special daughter."" If he didn't have any favourites he would have made a massive deal about how it's one of his Angel's first and one of his Angel's last and he's so excited all three of you get to experience  it together. Like a 2 for 1 special.

Think about the time line too, daughter one goes through highschool"" better renovate so she has tons of space to grow"" daughter 2 goes to school "" your sisters room is off limits because it might get used 1 month out of the year."" "
"She can certainly try this, but 99.9% chance he does not give her honest closure and instead gives her manipulative bullshit."

"""Mom, dad, when you spent significant time and money on our daughter by buying her expensive gifts and spending a lot of time here on her birthday, it was very generous and we appreciated it, but you seemed not to be as interested in our 10-year-old's birthday and you left before dinner. It made me feel as if my step-kids are not equally important in your eyes to your natural granddaughter.  While I understand that she is blood and they are not, they are now my kids as well, and I need for them to feel as special in your eyes as she is.  In order for that to happen, I need you to [whatever you need them to do].  I appreciate how much interest you are showing in our youngest, but it's important for me that the older kids feel like they are just as much a part of our family as she is, because they *are*."""
"Okay. After reading your previous posts I'm not really sure why you're still with this guy. 

He's oozing with toxic masculinity, yet is living off of you (quite hypocritical), his parenting is awful and even abusive and he lied to you about his divorce (something he didn't need to lie about but did anyway). 

I'm sure that he says all the right things at the right times to keep you hooked, but you've got to realize he's no good. No matter what he says, his actions tell you that he's not a good partner or parent.

Do you want him to raise your boy to be like him? A man who thinks little boys who cry are ""sissies"" and need to toughen up, who yells at and spanks his kids, rather than reaching them on their level. A man who is totally fine letting someone else pay his way while he does the bare minimum.

I'm not saying it's easy, but at least y'all aren't living together yet. You're better off alone than with this dude."
"Two weeks is to soon. He's essentially expecting you to host a guest while being postpartum. At two weeks postpartum he's really taking a risk that you are not going to be feeling well enough to host company, don't even get me started on the fact that YOU might be an emotional wreck from your hormones balancing out from pregnancy. Here's a suggestion. Why not have her come for a short visit prior to the birth? If it doesn't jive then it sure isn't going to jive once pumpkin comes along. I was very protective of my newborns and didn't like them out of my sight long, sometimes even with family. It sounds like this visit is all about her and her needs, not yours as a new mom. Her mental health being dependant on this pregnancy and the child should be cause for concern, speaking as a grandma myself, that's not normal. "
So he's abusive AND lazy? Take the dog and leave.
Did you two ever actually go to couples counseling? Or did he just pay lip service to end the fight?
I was very worried about his judgement and expected things to go awfully. He was there for three weeks and that's a long time to spend with someone the first time you meet. The relief is unreal 
"A few smashed powdered maybe.  But it’s not possible that all your lipsticks and bottles got opened with a simple fall.

"I think maybe all of the stresses plus pregnancy hormones just piled on until she just couldn’t handle any more pain. Let her mourn for a bit and gently suggest that she doesn’t have to get therapy but that she keep it as an option for later on.

"&gt;abandonment and neglect, which can wreak havoc on your relationships later in life.

I know you're not my therapist haha but I think you're right. I feel like I've been abandoned in almost every relationship I've had. The 3 best friends I've ever had have all ended up ghosting me with little emotion or explanation.

*popcorn*

&gt; Then he told me out of nowhere that HE loves me and would treat me so much better, he said stuff like he would always hold the door for me and pay for my food and stay by my side at the bar, which is all stuff that I guess he's seen Austin not do and decided that I didn't like it, even though it doesn't bug me. Evan told me that if I left Austin for him, he would take care of me forever, rub my feet every night and draw me baths or whatever and all this other creepy stuff.

It really sucks your father plays favourites. It hurts. Know that it isn't because you aren't good enough. Your father isn't a good enough dad.

You're good enough. Your father playing favourites is him doing it. It's not something you control and it's not like it's your job to fix your father. It hurts and there are other people who genuinely love you. Surround yourself with the people who truly love you and maybe let one of them give a speech at your wedding."

"My read as a former PhD student: He liked you so much that he started to behave slightly inappropriate toward you (the arm touching) and either he realized it, or someone else told him, and now he’s firmly establishing boundaries to prevent it from happening again.

As for what you can do, back off and don’t engage with him for a while (unless you have a genuine question only he can answer). And try to chill and focus on your classes.

Like most grad students, you’re obsessing and overthinking and anxious about connecting with mentors. I totally get it!  But you’re going to be in this program for a long time (took me 7 years). Your interests may change, your relationships with faculty will change as you get to know more of them over time. I thought I knew who I wanted on my committee as a first year, but by the time I was writing my prospectus I had a completely different group in mind.

I know it’s so counterintuitive for people like us, but the best thing you can do for your mental health is to back off, chill out, and not worry about solidifying deep mentor relationships in your first semester. It’s totally understandable to want an anchor, someone who gets you and cares about you, to guide you through this. But you don’t need him to survive. At the end of the day it’s your brain, your experience, your ideas, and the vast majority of a PhD is done alone.

I also have to say that his behavior (both before and after) does not reflect well on him. He was inappropriate with a female student, and now he’s basically punishing you and putting a big wall between you with potential implications for your career. This is how female students end up getting less attention from faculty — they aren’t invited to the bar like their male counterparts because of how it might look, and as a consequence faculty get to know male students better and become more invested in them. It sucks, and it’s shitty of him to already be doing this to you. But if it were me I’d be rethinking how much I even want a close relationship now that you know this about him. If it were me I’d be taking him off the pedestal and saying “Okay this guy isn’t so perfect and amazing. I’m going to approach this strategically and transactionally to get what I need from him for my career.”

My strategy would probably be to back way off and be professional and cold just like he’s doing. Keep your head down and do good work. Let time pass so that he feels reassured that you’re not going to initiate anything that makes him have feelings or behavior problems (ugh). Then after a good couple of years of this, perhaps you can revisit him being on your committee so that his name can help you out. But only if you’re confident that he’s going to do the work and not be so dismissive he’s unhelpful just to protect himself from his own pantsfeelings.

I’m sorry this happened to you."

"I'm going to go against the grain here: go ahead and give up, homie. If you're tired, rest.  Life isn't a marathon and this isn't a necessity. It sounds like the hunt and all the strategy discussions are stressing you out, and I can't imagine that's good for you or your goals. Take care of yourself, make a big reading list, and just feed your own soul right now. Forget other people and retreat as much into yourself as you like. You're not too old, though, and if you ever decide to start hunting again, you'll be better off after a rest."
"Halloween isn't for everyone, and different workplaces have very different cultures. But knowing that you dressed up and what you've been going through lately, it does sound like he expressed his opinion in a very tactless way. "
"Sounds like she never mourned the death of her fiance, and now it's hitting her all at once. At the time, forgetting about him was probably easier than accepting that she'd lost the man she planned to marry.

You can certainly encourage therapy, but obviously you can't force her to go. The best thing you can do is be there for her. As hard as it may be, let her cry on your shoulder. She may have told you she didn't love him, she may have even convinced herself to believe that, but she obviously did if she agreed to marry him. It's not fair of you to be upset by that (I know, it's hard to control your feelings, but at least don't let her know you're upset over it).

Hopefully, once she takes the time to truly grieve, she'll be able to move on with the life you two are creating together. "
"Wow, your sister sounds like a nasty person. Frankly, I'm not sure why you bother with these people. Your dad plays favorites, your sister sounds like an entitled mean girl, and your mom stuck her head in the sand. Other then supporting your mom through her illness, I would have very little to do with these people. You seem like a sweet person, OP, but being sweet and them being family doesn't mean you have to let them treat you like dirt. I've been there, done that, and I'm much happier disengaged from toxic family members."

"Maybe I'm just a cynic today but here's my take on this. He seems manipulative to me.

&gt; He then says “feel like I’m the only one pouring out my soul”.

That was an opening to see if you would ""confess"". He may have also been hoping for you to open up about any relationship issues with your husband, which would have given him an opening. When you didn't (because, for you, it wasn't *that* kind of situation, you were comforting a friend) he turned it around to make you feel like you were being overly intimate.

&gt;This is where it gets cringey. He says: “Hey, this is a bit too intimate, don’t you think?” 

He didn't get the answer he wanted, so he flips it.

&gt;He says: “I mean, don’t you feel bad ? Shouldn’t you tell your husband about this?”, I say “I guess”. “Then he hits me with “What would you do if I asked you to kiss me right now ?”.

He then tries to make you feel like you already did something wrong, as well as trying to gauge if you're willing to cross a line. 

&gt;He’s like, “Oh I guess I didn’t know what this was”, and “I feel disappointed you put me in this position”, “I feel almost like you were using me”.

Here he's trying to make you feel like the offending party, deflecting things again, as well as making an opening for you to potentially comfort him again.

Distance yourself from this person. Even if he was just being really weird and not intentionally manipulative, he's bad news."
I'd roll him to the curb until he decides he's okay with a nursing home. Cussing at the kids? Threatening to kill everyone? F that. He blew his chance at a comfortable life with family.
"My first words to my husband when I met him IRL after years of online interactions were “you are tall.” I spilled 3 separate drinks into my sleeve. For a goodbye I said “see you in games”.

"&gt; They are different people from the perspective of a partner even if they are the same in other aspects.

That's the real key here.

Being bi doesn't mean you're attracted to every single male or female, just like being hetero doesn't mean you're attracted to every single person of the opposite sex, just like being homo doesn't mean you're attracted to every person of the same sex.

It's perfectly normal, if not expected, that OP wouldn't inherently be attracted to Christine the same way she's attracted to Chris.  "
"she ruined a kids birthday party and is still sticking to her guns? has your brother tried to find out why she's not respecting what sounds like quite a beloved family tradition?

this is really his hill to climb because he's the one who married her, but pointing out to her that none of her intervention has improved matters for anyone could do something. "
"I'm guessing you're not an introvert. 

He's 19. He's not 90. Some people bloom later than others, and it sounds like YOU think he's unhappy therefore he IS unhappy. That's you projecting your fears and concerns for him onto him, it's not necessarily his reality.

He is a separate person from you. If he's content, why force him to exist in a place where he wouldn't be? And why does being a introvert automatically guarantee he's going to be alone his whole life? 

Maybe give ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts In A World That Can't Stop Talking"" a read so you can understand him better."

Ask him whether you smell bad next time he does it and then tell him to knock it off because he's being creepy. If it doesn't stop then consider finding another place to live. 
"I guess I’m just lost at what to do, and how long I realistically have to do this before he gets too old and remembers and resents me, if that makes sense "
"I think you need to be clear with him WHY it makes you feel bad. If money has never been an object for him, it literally may not occur to him that anyone would have issues about him spending extravagant amounts on them. After all, it's just money. He's thinking of it as a convenient means to have fun experiences with you, so if it's a barrier for you he'll just remove the barrier by paying. But money isn't just money to you, it represents something about who you are and where you came from. Unfortunately we do have a bit of a cultural thing where people will protest against having something paid for but it's meant as a polite gesture and not meant to be taken seriously. He might be hearing, ""I can't afford it"" and the solution to him is to just pay for it, so you two need to have a serious conversation about what you are and aren't comfortable with.

If he can't understand that and respect your comfort levels, maybe he isn't the person for you."

"If you do say anything to your mother, you could tell her that your sister knows exactly why you don't talk to her."
"At this point you need to move forward as if your marriage is ending. I highly suggest you seek a lawyer, a counselor for your daughter and a family counselor for both you and your daughter. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this, but you need to be focusing all of your energy on taking of your daughter and yourself, not your ex."
"Brother, I am sorry to hear all this!

Here are some thoughts on how to move forward:

*  Take some time to just deal with the emotional impact.  Stay in contact with friends and family, but take a day or two to cry it all out (if you haven't already).  Drink a little, just get it out.

*  From there, find a new place to live - maybe something temporary with your family.  Talk to your landlord about breaking your lease, tell him the circumstances and maybe they'll be understanding.

*  Go ahead and block her on facebook as well.  There's no need to torture yourself to keep up some public appearance.

*  Join a gym and go as often as possible.  I went through an awful breakup in my early/mid twenties, and the only thing that saved me from absolute self-destruction was a gym membership.  I transformed myself physically, but most importantly mentally and emotionally.

*  Realize that you'll have occasional times that it feels like you've been punched in the gut out of nowhere.  Keep up the communication with friends and family so you don't descend too deep into depression.

God speed man."
"No way! You are 19 years old, your mother can’t have that much control over your life. There’s one thing abiding by their rules but this is taking it to the extreme.

"I'm gonna go against the grain here and express empathy towards your boyfriend. 

Look, some people are just not fond of pets. That doesn't make them heartless or evil. While great companions, dogs are still largely messy, hyperactive animals and not everyone's personality meshes with it. 

To me, it seems as if you both barreled past your BF's hesitation to obtain a pet in order to create some kitschy little dream family. You were so focused on this idea you created in your head that you both failed to think about the ""what ifs"" of bringing a small life into an environment where one partner wasn't 100% on board.

If you keep pushing your BF to bond with the dog despite his wishes, it may cause resentment to grow. You two might just be incompatible now, and that's okay. A pet is a big deal; it's not really something anyone should be ""taking the plunge"" on.

Best of luck, whatever you two decide."
"He has already demonstrated that he isn't willing to change his situation - and from his POV why would he? You're still with him, he's still drinking like a fish and coming and going to work as he pleases, and as far as his future goals, well he's relying on getting an inheritence, and that's pretty much it.

Can you see yourself spending the rest of your life with this guy? "
"I agree. Your advisor should be a professional relationship, not a friend or companion. When reading your post, it really sounds like your describing a situation that's more than platonic, and wondering why you've been 'ghosted.' My guess is that one of your professors colleagues made him aware of possible implications of your every friendly relationship, and he's establishing barriers. Hopefully, you can accept and honor those barriers while having a stellar academic relationship."

"Your parents are somehow 4yos, friend. Sorry about that.

Weddings bring out the irrationality in a lot of people who are otherwise great to deal with and be related to, and they tend not to recognize it because family *also* tend to feel entitled to acting entitled about other people's weddings. 

I wish I knew what to tell you that would fix this, but the truth is that you can't fix your mother deciding to be a toddler. The only advice I do have is this: **DO NOT HAVE THE ""FAMILY TALK"".** Nothing good comes of this. If you feel like you need to let your mother air her concerns, DO NOT BRING YOUR WIFE, because your mother is 100% going to shit all over her and say the kind of things that a reasonable daughter-in-law with a healthy self-image and good boundaries will never be able to and should never forgive.

If you talk to your mother about this, either in person or on the phone, when she starts working herself up, warn her once that you're going to leave or hang up if she doesn't act like an adult, and then *do it*. You are a grown human being and you don't have to put up with this behaviour from her."
"It’s interesting that most of the examples you listed describing the closeness of your friendship are situations where he was there for you. And some of those situations sound quite dramatic or difficult. Is it possible your friendship is a bit one-sided or that he could feel a little drained from the darker moments you described? I don’t mean to be hurtful by suggesting this, but it made me wonder how even your friendship is.

There’s a lot of guessing happening in a situation where only he has the answers. You either suck it up and ask (as hard as that may be!) or you accept there are tons of reasons not to ask someone to be in your wedding party. Love and friendship isn’t a tit-for-tat. Weddings unfortunately force couples to inadvertently “rank” the people in their lives, but it doesn’t mean they don’t care for you."
"I don't know how you've managed to continue this friendship going... if you can even call this level of disrespect and double standard a friendship. Don't *try* to distance yourself - just fuggin do it. You've told her how you feel and she refuses to acknowledge your feelings... as if she's the leading authority on what you require from a friend. Stop letting this jerk dictate your life and go find better friends. I would have burned this bridge half way through your post. If your friend can't hear you out when you say you feel disrespected, that's not a friend, much less the best."
"So, while I actually do think that people being willing to meet with bigots *does* often help to work them out of their beliefs (see: the story of Derek Black, son of Don Black, Stormfront founder), I also believe that we as individuals are under no obligation to, as you so perfectly stated,  be ""used as some sort of an experiment to see if a bigot might come around"". You were not being 'unfair', what a load of crap."

"I think that all of the stress from working is affecting his emotional/sexual drive! My boyfriend is the same way, if he’s tired/stressed about work, his libido drops right off.
I would definitely suggest couples therapy! Tell him that you really rely on intimacy and find it important for your relationship. Read the 5 love languages book and describe it to him; it sounds like you just have different ways of showing affection to one another and you need to communicate what you need the other person to do!

I hope all of this helps, and things start to look up for you and your little family! This is a roadbump but definitely not a dealbreaker. Just needs some earnest communication and time hopefully :) "
"It's really not that universal. :) Not everyone grows up imagining their dad walking them down the aisle.

Think about what you really want from your relationship with your father that's possible with the father you have. I know that's a tough thing to wrap your head around, but sometimes the relationship we imagine with our parents just isn't possible with the parents we have.

I would suggest having a conversation with him though, because he probably has no idea how blatant his favouritism is, and he might at least make an effort if he knew how much it was hurting you."
"I think it would help you to go to therapy so you can process and discuss these feelings - they are legitimate, and my heart breaks for you. With a therapist, you can discuss whether its something you should bring up to your dad and how you can go forward. "

CANNOT AGREE WITH THIS ENOUGH. It’s so nice that they think your fiancé is “one of the good ones” but the fact remains that they can’t in good conscience agree to their lineage being polluted by his inferior genetics. That is literally Nazi rhetoric from start to finish. You should think long and hard about what message it sends to your fiancé if you choose to continue a relationship with people who consider him to be inferior by virtue of his ethnicity.
You buried the lede here. Why are you with someone who would send such hateful texts to you? Or use your eating disorder against you? Or who would insult your grammar? This isn’t a “he is so loving in everything but...”. No. What he is like elsetime does not excuse this.

"Lmao, when a guy throws how many girls he's been with in your face to make you feel inferior, it's a lie. That type of shit just demonstrates how immature he is. Don't sweat it. Being with a lot of girls doesn't make someone cooler or better than you, especially when they play that dumb card."

&gt; We support each other in many ways and show each other love an affection. The support completely ends when it comes to the money situation.  

Yeah -- actual, tangible support. He's fine with making sounds with his mouth-hole in order to convince you to keep supporting his ass, but anything else? Even not ordering a pizza on your last dime? Not gonna happen.

&gt; I know this is a common problem that comes up in relationships but I don't know how to get my concerns through his head.

It's not a common problem at all. Normal, functional people do not behave like this. You can't get your concerns through his head because he's a moocher who is using you, and he's going to continue mooching and using you for as long as you allow it.

That part is up for you to decide."
"well. that sucks and I am sorry.

A possible thing to do when the time comes:

Your dad does NOT get the honour of walking you down the aisle.
He does not get the honour of a daughter daddy dance at your wedding.
He does NOT get the honour of a speech at your wedding.

IF you want him to attend, it is as guest only.

Now, how does your BF's dad feel about you? is there another figure you feel was more of a dad to you than he was? Then you confer that honour on them.

He will be angry but you can calmly point out all the reasons why:

You missed 3/4 our of d/DD dances in school and never put in the effort towards ME that you did HER.
You made it abundantly clear that I am not really to be considered as a favoured daughter

I have never been all that important in your life, Tell me why I should allow you to have this privilege? and * because I am your dad* does not cut it. You have made every possible effort for sister but have not once put in the same effort for me and believe me I noticed. It showed. It hurt. And I am going to now do what is best for me.

Be strong. Perhaps some therapy on how to deal with the scenario?"
"Not necessarily. I just...idk those last words ""THAT'S how much I loved her"" just keep ringing in my head and I don't think I'll be able to get them out. To me they really say ""THAT'S how much more I loved her than you"" and I can only really be okay when I'm not thinking about it. And no matter what he says during my speech, those are the words I will hear, and I don't know if I can handle hearing them on my wedding day.

Idk if any of this even makes sense, I'm a bit all over the place right now, this is bringing up a lot of negative emotions.

"A lot of this post resonated deeply with me because I was in a similar situation. I’m bisexual and cared very deeply for someone who came out to me as MtF. 

It came as a big shock because she had hidden carefully away herself with a hyper masculine exterior. It seemed out of the blue to me at the time, but after a lot of discussion, it was revealed that she had been hiding in a cloak of extreme maleness since being berated as a child, when she was caught exploring female clothing for the first time. She spent years building this to protect herself, and it was impenetrable. Absolutely nobody would have guessed the turmoil based on how she presented her male shell.  

I grieved at first. I think that’s pretty common. The future I thought we were going to have suddenly became unobtainable, I cried for days as though the person I loved had died. I also valued how much they must trust me to tell me about their true self. 

Ultimately, while I was bi, that didn’t mean this relationship was automatically compatible. There’s fallout when someone hides something from a relationship, and this is a big thing. You are not obligated to stay simply because you are interested in women, and your partner is looking to become one. 

Give yourself time. Things don’t have to be settled immediately. At the time, I browsed an online support group for partners of transitioning individuals and a common reaction was “this new person isn’t what I signed up for, I thought the old person was for forever”. 

As for the just a phase thing, did you ever have someone wonder that about your bisexuality?"
She lied to you. You found out because you investigated. Take this as a strong indication that she may cheat again. You should end it now.

"Damn. In no way is this appropriate for them to tell you to do this. It seems like you're not comfortable with asking for money from your half-brother, so don't give in if they keep pressuring you. What does your sister think about this? Maybe if you explain the situation to her and ask for her support when you try and convince your parents again it will work out better?"
"I'm bisexual as well, and I totally get it. Being bi doesn't mean being attracted to everyone. Transitioning is a big deal. Your partner will change a lot, and in ways that neither of you can possibly anticipate yet. 

I know what you mean about being attracted to ""Chris"" as a man rather than as any other gender. It's hard to explain to other people. If you have a lot of LGBT friends you might get some shit over this, if I'm being honest. The community has a bad habit of conflating attraction with validation. I'd suggest saying something like ""please respect the fact that this is way more complex than you might believe"" if that happens. 

It doesn't make you transphobic. It doesn't make you a shitty partner. This is a situation where nobody is wrong and it just sucks. 

I've known a lot of people who transitioned. It never seems to work out with the person they were dating before coming out. The trans partner often feels paranoid that their partner is attracted to the parts of their body that they hate about themselves. The other partner might feel lied to, or just overwhelmed. Being intimate with someone with dysphoria has its own considerations. "
"Don't sacrifice your mental health to placate your parents. You're an adult and are fully in control of your mental capacity; this ""request"" of theirs is them saying that they don't trust you enough to make important decisions regarding your own body.

"I'm so sorry you're going through this. Loss is never easy.

I've been in your shoes. I'll spare you the long story, but this happened with my sister in law (husband's brother's wife) when my Dad died. She had met him a total of 4 times and was mopping up all of the Facebook sympathy for ""her loss""... All the while she never once tried to contact any member of my family to show any sympathy to us (she hates my guts, though).

You're upset because it feels disingenuous and disrespectful. My personal term for it is ""Stolen Grief"". Because to me, it's much like those guys who walk around pretending to be Navy seals and taking ""Stolen Valor"". Nobody has to explain why this is disgusting behavior, it just is.

If you believe your girlfriend really means well and just doesn't realize this is hurtful, I'd try to talk to her and tell her, ""Hey, GF. I know you probably had the best of intentions with your Instagram post, and I'm glad you had the chance to meet my friend over that one weekend. But I have to admit it makes me uncomfortable both to have you posting publicly about my friend's death (because you know I'm a more private person) and also that you're accepting sympathy over the death of my close friend who you didn't really know well. I feel like it cheapens my own pain and grief over the loss of my dear friend. I know you didn't mean any harm, but I found your post and the sympathy you received from your followers very hurtful"".

If her response is anything other than to immediately take down the post and apologize to you, you know what kind of person she really is; someone that will intentionally use the heartbreak and tragedy of others for her own gain.

ETA: I'm pretty private with my emotions, even more so when it comes to social media. This would absolutely bother me."
"Please call CPS. My sister is a trash hoarder. She and her five kids (and husband) live in the filthiest, most disgusting home I've ever seen. Those poor kids get made fun of at school for ""being smelly"" and they're always dirty. Unwashed. They don't even have to brush their teeth. My 5 year old niece still isn't fully POTTY TRAINED because it's too much effort on the part of my shit sister. They begged me to let them come live with me when I had only seen them once in close to 10 years. (Different states) That being said, I did call CPS. They told me that they would check it out but likely couldn't do anything but suggest she clean her house. UNLESS they had bug infestations. I didn't see any and didn't know if they had any so I couldn't say for sure when we spoke. Apparently, bed bugs, roaches, rodents, etc is a tipping point on what's considered abusive and unfit. That poor baby is in for a world of issues as he grows in this environment. Calling on my own sister was one of the hardest decisions I've made, but in the end, the kids need better. They need to be clean and safe. "

She really needs therapy to sort through her shit from her past, but that's not your job."
"They said he's not my real family, they are. I agree that my parents and sister are more important but I want to have him in my life too. "
"As a child free person, hell, just as a person in general, I would never treat a pregnant friend or a friend who is already a parent in this way. You don't owe her any explanation other than that it is doctor's orders. She may react poorly, but then that goes to show just how poor of a  friend she is. Her telling you to your face that she dislikes your pregnancy should be enough of a reason to distance yourself."
"&gt;&gt; I care for this guy a lot but how do I help him overcome his insecurities and show him he can have good things too if he doesn’t destroy them all?

You don't. This guy is willing to hurt you for no reason, and the only proper response is to dump him, not to have misplaced empathy for him (which yours is at the moment)."
What about having a kid and cutting it in half and discarding one half?
"Hell I CARRIED AND BIRTHED MY CHILD and didn't immediately feel the love when I got pregnant. I was literally feeling kicks and hearing her heartbeat and I still didn't feel love until a few days after her birth. 

Some people really don't bond immediately...some of us take a while OP. So don't feel awful for it. "
"He's an asshole. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even if I was dating someone who did something I didn't like, if I accidentally broke something of theirs, I would replace it, and certainly wouldn't tell them to ""just forget it"". It wasn't an accident, and if it was, he's acting like a piece of shit anyway."
"So much agreeing with you. This is ridiculous. 

Wtf did I just read in the OP, her roommate gets butthurt if she's not home enough? New, strong set of boundaries needed asap. "
"People with “normal” families cant understand what the rest of us go through. They can try, but they typically just don’t. My husband wouldn’t tell his family if he had $5 extra because they would come up with a way to need it more than he does. 

Your family wouldn’t be proud of your success, they would be envious and use it against you. It’s ok not to tell them the truth, they are not people you owe the truth to. "
"I think that this is something you need to talk to your husband about - is there a reason that he doesn’t help with the household chores? Does he have a higher tolerance for mess than you or does he just think that they are not his responsibility? 

Before you quit your job you might want to consider if you would be able to return to it after a prolonged period of unemployment should the two of you divorce. Are you going to be happy being a stay at home parent? 

Would it be simpler to pay a house cleaner to do a few hours a week, so there are fewer jobs to do between the two of you."
"&gt; Just the fact that he hurt me on purpose and made it a point to tell me he meant it has been really really bothering me.

It should.

&gt; I care for this guy a lot but how do I help him overcome his insecurities and show him he can have good things too if he doesn’t destroy them all?

This guy hurt you on purpose and you want to help him overcome his insecurities?

Instead of trying to convince him that he deserves good, try convincing yourself that you deserve good. Because you do. You deserve to not be with a man who assaults you. "
"Your reply is perfect - hits every point spot on, with good insight into the situation and sensible advice. OP, I would follow this plan!

And - what an absolute pain, and how unprofessional. Good on you for being above the nastiness and having such clear boundaries for yourself. Good luck for your future position!"
"It sounds like you have a pattern of stating a boundary, and then immediately deconstructing it the instant you get any resistance.  You sound extremely motivated by guilt.  It's not great that your husband effectively takes advantage of the fact that you crumble the instant he implies you're a bad person, but it's also something that is in your control not to do"
[removed]
"So he's had more than enough notice to save up $50 or whatever he needed to plan this picnic for you and couldn't do it. Is the lawsuit a sure thing? Because it's really naive to plan on future money that isn't guaranteed and you guys need to be planning to live like you'll  never get it. 

He's made it clear time and again that he's not someone who you can trust to meet your needs. Is this really a guy you can trust to build the future you want together?"
"Red herring here is the mentioning of mom. You're now angry at the mom, but look at this again: he's the passive one who cannot do anything and his mom is this evil villain who decides for him. Maybe she is an overbearing demanding type, but it's on your boyfriend to stand up to that and set his own boundaries. That means that he leads his own life and bickers a bit about these days with his mom, but finds a compromise that's good for the partner he's investing in for his future family. That compromise shouldn't happen because you cried, it should be there because of his choices.

So don't go arguing with the MIL yet, if she is a nutter, that can always be done later. Talk to the BF first about his passiveness."
"&gt; I was trying to make him jealous 

And that’s what happens when someone has no time for these sort of petty games. You can try telling him, with complete transparency, that’s what you were doing, and you won’t do it it again, and you’re trying to become more self aware of why you’d do such things, but it sounds like this guy is done. 

Learn from this and don’t rely on these sort of nonsense tactics in the future. "
"&gt;&gt;""what the fuck you think I'm doing?

No loving partner talks to their SO like this. You pay for everything and don't feel free to be yourself, and she blames *you* for her nasty behavior; I wonder why you are staying with her."
"The fact that it isn't even her dog and didn't ask you before giving her friend the ok says a lot about how little respect she has for you and your things IMO and you have every reason to not ""lend"" your dog out if you don't feel comfortable with it."
I would sign it ‘the mean one’ 
"I don't live with my parents most of the time, so that's not an issue atm at least "
"Also, who among us hasn’t had a relationship end without “closure” ? It happens ALL THE TIME and is not an excuse to have sex with your ex when you’re in a committed relationship."
"Man what the fuck is this, the 80s? I mean really. My parents are in an interfaith marriage, and when they got married in the 80s they couldn't find a rabbi to do the wedding but their whole families came, including my super religious Christian grandparents. This is some bullshit. Incidentally I'm a rabbi, so if you want to talk to clergy about this feel free to PM me."
"She needs to contact him because he's on the lease of their shared apartment, took the car that's half hers, and left his dog (I will confess my bias here and say that this detail makes me HATE him - if he can't be bothered to care that his dog is okay, he's a bad person.).  These are all enormous financial and logistic burdens that she is 100% in the right to try to get sorted out. 

OP, if I were you, I'd find one friend, preferably a mutual friend with a big mouth, and confide everything.  God only knows what he's planning on telling the friend group, but I doubt it will be truthful.  You *need* support right now and the reason he doesn't want you to tell your friends the truth is because it makes him look TERRIBLE."
"I've experienced something similar to what you are describing and felt so DUMB about it for a long time. What finally helped me is realizing that I kept having this problem because these thoughts were actually a pattern of intrusive thoughts - and, as typical, the more I tried to fight them off because I felt mean, silly, or dumb, the more pervasive the thoughts became.

Not sure if you're familiar with any of the mindfulness techniques recommended for dealing with intrusive thoughts, but some quick Google searching on the matter may help this issue. Definitely did for me! 

 "
"Honestly i would distance the shit out of this relationship, i wouldn't see her in person until she accepted that i didn't want to see this woman again. "
"I got a lot of flack in a previous thread for saying this, but, any adult who can't budget *something* for their SO's birthday/holiday/date night, either doesn't care to or isn't a truly functioning adult. 


Shit happens, but if you're out of school and can't come up with $20 for your girl's birthday, you done fucked up son.  "
"Dude I looked at your post history, I REMEMBER you, when are you going to stop letting this horrible dude treat you like garbage??? Seriously, him not bothering to do one single little thing for you should not surprise you AT ALL, it is the tip of the iceberg."
I’d be honest and up front to your boss. “____ has made numerous comments about strongly disliking me so I don’t think she’d appreciate if I was involved in the gift giving. I’m going to sit this one out so that it doesn’t impact her shower.” Makes it seem like you are concerned about her while you don’t have to pitch in a penny and boss is aware of the comments she’s been making towards you. Win win win! 
"Please cut all financial ties.  This includes shared bank accounts, amazon, Netflix, phone plans, insurance etc.  Then pull your credit reports and and then lock your credit with all four credit reporting agencies.  It is very common for entitled family members to open fraudulent credit card accounts and the like in children’s names.

It is not your place to save your family if they are not responsible with their money.  It sounds like they were OK until recently.  What changed?  Don’t fall for the guilt trips.  They will say we raised you and paid for everything until you were 18.  Well that was their legal responsibility to feed and house you.  After 18 if they freely supported you and did not say it was a loan or discuss payback then it is not appropriate to now ask you for money.  They did not give you a choice of whether or not you wanted to be in debt to them, they just suddenly decided you owe them.

Don’t ever share your financial information with them again.  They will just take advantage. Don’t fall for the guilt trips, they will be OK.  A house with back tax s does not get foreclosed on immediately, it is a long process.

If for some reason you do decide to give them money never give them cash.  Directly pay off the bill or loan.  That way your money gets used for the intended purpose and not vacation, booze, drugs, gambling, or whatever addiction or wasteful habit they choose.

"
"&gt;I am losing my health and my well-being.

Those are very good reasons to not be with someone. She is not being a good partner, regardless of the excuse she is using that is cultural, you have clearly expressed how it bothers you and she continues to do it. If she is kissing and touching other guys in front of you how far does she go if you are not there?"
"&gt;He said he didn't think of it as a big deal because it's just pictures of another woman, and he was curious.

But she’s not *just* another woman. She’s your sister. There are millions of photos of any number of strangers that he could get off to: your sister should be off-limits. How do you think she would feel about a family member using her pics?

Has he at the very least agreed that he won’t do that again. Because I certainly don’t think you should try to condone him continuing to do that. "
"You’ve gotten a lot of good advice just wanted to add - make sure you guys talk about long term plans for when his parents are elderly. It’s pretty standard culturally for them to expect to move in with him when that happens. Even if you guys are on the same page and he doesn’t want that either, you need to get into details - does that mean you guys support them financially? What are the limits on that? Would they stay in India or would you get a house for them near you? Is there another kid they can live with instead? Etc etc. you’re going to want to make sure that not only are you two on the same page but also that his parents know they won’t be moving in with you in 10 years. Don’t let them just not put away money for retirement and then claim you have to take them into because faaaaamily. "
"I'm not generally one to advocate lying to spare someone's feelings when they're being unreasonable, but it sounds like you can tell them the truth until you're blue in the face and get nowhere. You could always lay the blame at your employer's feet. ""We're so busy right now that I'd be risking my job if I gave up paying work to sell your house for free."" "
"OP, be very careful about trusting his family members. Especially if they are a part of the same religious community you are.  His sister might rat you out to him ""with the best of intentions"".



Put your important documents (and the children's) in a safe place, and go talk to a lawyer.  Child support and alimony exist for exactly this reason - so that a non-working spouse can't be ""trapped"" in a marriage.  "
"I started writing a different comment, and then realized you've only been dating him for 3.5 months. All this less than 4 months in? Oh no. Nope. I don't think this is just being sensitive because of your last boyfriend. I think your new guy is being an ass about your looks too. 

Like, if you haven't asked him directly, you could tell him to knock it off? ""I like the way I look. I'm happy with my hair, my body, my wardrobe, and my makeup. If I want your opinion, I will ask for it. But the unsolicited suggestions and comments need to stop."" But really, the first few months should be the honeymoon period. He should be on his best behavior. And if his best behavior is criticizing pretty much everything about the way you look and dress? Nah, man. Get outta here with that nonsense.

My husband is very frank about his preferences. He likes redheads (which I'm not), and I know exactly which items of clothing and makeup choices of mine he does and doesn't like. It still sounds like your boyfriend has criticized you more in a few months than my husband has criticized me in 6 years. You can do so, so much better.

&amp;#x200B;"
"I just went through this with my husband when my son was 5 months old. I had also left my corporate job to raise our family and was very afraid of his temper. First of all, I’m sorry you’re dealing with this - and know that it gets so much better.

What I wish I was able to do prior to the “blow up” of leaving:

Gather any evidence of his affair, his spending, any physical or emotional abuse. I was in such denial, I hid my bruises and convinced myself his increased spending was normal. This all would’ve been huge for my divorce and custody proceedings but I had no proof.

Have easy access to any valuables, cash, and important documents. I ended up in a situation where I had to flee my home and I lost everything.

I also wish I had let someone I trusted know what was going on. I ended up in a scary situation because I insisted all was well to the outside world, and suffered through this alone.

You can do this. It’s not going to be fun but you have the rest of your life ahead of you and you deserve so much more than a spouse who would do this to his family. You will find strength you didn’t know you had. Good luck to you!"
"It would depend on the context of the conversation. Could it have been something along the lines of him lamenting not finding any dates and she was, dude, you’re hot, you’ll find someone. 
Or just hey, coworker, did you know you’re hot?
One is definitely flirting. "
"Likely, he has some issues with coming out and how you are going to react to that and is going to be, as shown, afraid. Coming out is scary and he seems like he's judging his chances that it'll go well right about now. All I can really say is that he will be ready when he is ready, and reaction is key. You think highly of him, though, and I'm really glad he has a safe place to land with this.

Asking him outright if he is comfortable with dating isn't a bad idea, and may give him space to at least say he isn't ready to disclose some things to you or that he hasn't told you everything.

I hope things go well for both of you!"
This guy doesn't sound like he respects you very much. You've been dating him for YEARS and he won't pay for a meal out? Ever? Does he have a job?
Yes. He is a threat to your relationship and has stated he is intentionally trying to sabotage it.
[deleted]
"&gt; How do I get out of this?

It doesn't sound like you're even in it. They're pissed you don't want to work for them for free? Let them be pissed. The fact that they're upset isn't a problem for you to fix. 

&gt;  “that commission is worth more than family”

Do they know how much that commission is? Have you explained to them, ""Mom and Dad, if I put 60-80 hours of work into selling your house for zero commission, that means I'm giving up the opportunity to make $20k (made-up number) on your house, or on another house that I *am* being paid to sell. If you have $20k in your pocket that you are willing to give me right now, I will be your realtor. Otherwise, you are asking me to pay *you* $20k, when I need that money for my family.""

But seriously, I wouldn't even bother getting into the conversation with them. Let then sulk, let them whinge, let them cry. Go about your life. "
I second the breakup party!
"👏👏👏👏 Logical. Dispassionate. Succinct. OP, if you want to get a head-start on adult-ing, r/bunnyball88 's script is brilliant. "
So you think coffee and lunch undoes seven years of being shitty?
Your husband needs to get a driver's licence.
"Bingo!

OP whether or not she has romantic and/or sexual feelings for you, she's married and you aren't interested in an affair, so that's that. I'd put some gentle space between you just to define some boundaries. 

Friendship stuff? Absolutely! But when it started to cross into ambiguous flirty territory I'd make an excuse to get back to work, get off the phone, stop texting for the night, move away from physical touches, etc. If she notices and asks what's wrong be honest - ""Nothing is wrong but I'm gay and you're married. I don't want to interact with you in a way that feels like either of us is crossing a boundary."" She'll probably protest that *she* doesn't mind, remind her that *you* do. 

If something makes you feel bad, whether it's guilt because you like her husband, or frustration because she's not available, or confusion because you're not sure if she's joking, then you need to remove yourself from that for your own sake. If she's a good friend she'll respect that. "
I'm not trying to scare you but the time you're most likely to be murdered by an abusive spouse is when you leave. 
"&gt;I feel like I've been abandoned in almost every relationship I've had. The 3 best friends I've ever had have all ended up ghosting me with little emotion or explanation. 

I wonder if, because you're so desperate to be loved, your putting up with people who don't truly care for you? Do you finding yourself chasing after people the more they pull away? 

If you're not already in therapy, I would suggest you try and find some. It sounds like you may need a little help fine-tuning your picker.

Now, as to your family - it sounds like, for whatever reason, they favor your sister. Good parents would never show that kind of favoritism, but your parents do. You could try and dance for their approval but, in the end, you'd never get it. You'll one be hurting yourself.

I know it sucks, but your family will never be the people you want them to be. They will never love you like you want them to. It's going to hurt like hell, but you'ven got to lower your expectations, and just accept that what you're getting is all you're ever going to get. Therapists can help with that.

And once you're out the other side, you'll find some sort of freedom in realising that, if that love you less, you're allowed to love them less. If your partner treats you with the kindness and affection you deserve, you're allowed to care for him more than for them. If his family treats you with more kindness than yours does, then you're allowed to prioritize them, even if your family resents that. If your friends have your back when your family doesn't, then direct your energy to them. 

You're allowed to focus your love and attention on those people who focus their love and energy on you. Your parents may have been great parents to you sister, but they're shitty parents to you. You don't owe them a place in your life."
"Also just to add, even if she apologizes and wants to do better in these instances, it will probably take a few more occurrences before you really see progress.  Lifelong problems like she has expressed don't normally get corrected after one event / one night.  It normally takes having to address the problem a few times differently until she finds what works for her.  "
"Send him a text that you understand what happened, that further apologies aren't necessary, but that you don't want to meet for coffee. 

Unless you actually want to meet for coffee of course. But that will signal that you want to keep the friendship going.

Poor guy, I do feel for him, too. But you don't need to meet him if you don't want to."
"&gt;In hanging out/getting drinks with my friends it's almost like pulling teeth to get him to feel okay with me leaving him.

That is not remotely normal, at all. Has he made any attempts at addressing the issue?

Either way, you, in a normal and sensible fashion for someone your age, want to establish your independent life. He wants to break up if you do that. I am not sure how you can convince him to see your side of it, when he is a 28(!) year old man who cannot handle his GF going out to meet her friends.

Sorry, but he is *nowhere* near stable enough for a relationship. You are young, you do not need to tie yourself to such a person. I guarantee there will be other relationships with closeness and affection, probably quite a few. "
"Your wife treats you like a doormat. I found it interesting that you feel she doesn't really know the real you because you wear a mask around her to keep the peace. Can you see how toxic that is? Your _wife_ doesn't know the real you. And you have been shouldering the burden of avoiding fights by essentially creating a version of yourself....that will wear on you. 

The few interactions you describe are absolutely cringe-y. You strike me as VERY tolerant and understanding, but to the point I worry about your self-esteem and judgment. 

Please, stop trying to take it on yourself to find the perfect version of yourself that your wife doesn't want to yell at. You at a minimum need therapy - together and separately - to see whether this is recoverable but to be candid she would need to change dramatically for this to become a healthy, balanced situation for you both. I strongly encourage you to start setting some firm boundaries for how you get to be treated and then hold her to those boundaries. And PLEASE do not have children with her; this same treatment will be applied to them, I am certain. "
"Not to get crazy dark, but beware of any sexual contact too. You don’t know where he’s been or who he’s been with. Might want to get tested. Again I’m sorry. I know that’s dark. But your health and safety are important."
Another thing is moms that are too active in their sons lives can definitely hamper their ability to socialize. Especially if the mom goes around telling everyone that their son is really shy and tells them to try to include him - this can completely destroy someone's social life. 
[deleted]
Exactly.  He was getting laid somewhere else and needed to cut out Op asap.
"&gt; He says he thinks it’s best he leaves, but still sits there just “thinking” for the longest time, looking back at me like I’m supposed to say something. 

He was waiting for you to change your mind. He knows exactly what he was doing. "
"I am almost certain your wife posted on this sub within the last few days because I've read this exact situation from the wife's perspective. 

Editing to ad this link. Holy man, treat your wife better.

"So...when they discussed their relationship and decided to be friends, what would have happened if they’d decided differently? Would he be having an affair right now?

To me that conversation alone is a deal breaker, to get so intimate with another women that you’re discussing if you want to be together? That’s marriage destroying material right there.

"
"Dude, he didn't cancel the trip. He canceled the entire relationship. "
Meh whatever. honestly my dad has foot in mouth problems and he's also kind of sexist. He probably just meant a prettier daughter. I'm well adjusted and an adult so it really doesn't bother me much. My brother and sister in law are crazy af (like anti vaxxer crazy) so honestly not being like her is a huge compliment. Lol
"I'm so sorry you feel these things. u/canitakemybraoffyet (your username made me lol). You just have to say ""We're not doing those traditions"" and nothing more. You don't have to have a big blow up confrontation if you don't want to - what good comes from it? Would you rather your dad actually tell you that he loves you less or lie and say he loves you equally?

Don't JADE (Justify Argue Defend Explain). Just say we're not doing those traditions, it does not work for us. It's your wedding and you can do whatever you want. So opt out.

You sound like you were the ""Lost Child"" in your family while your sister was the ""Golden Child/Hero."" I would encourage you to read up on dysfunctional families and those roles.

"
"&gt;I don’t mean to be black and white but cheating is just something I DO NOT tolerate.

&gt; I did forgive him once.

You broke your own deal-breaker. You know what to do. Good luck."
She’s cheating on you. End the relationship and move on. 
"Are you sure you're ready to get married? You have never dated someone else, you're just 23 and not sure about your sexual orientation. These aren't bad things at all but don't you think getting married will stop you from getting any room to learn more about yourself in this point of your life? Maybe you end up falling for a woman, do you want to risk having to get a divorce? I'm really happy for you and your fiancé but I can't help thinking that postponing getting married is a good idee with all these uncertainties going on. "
"OP, I think the rest of this thread is under-reacting. You are an underage girl who is economically dependent on her much older boyfriend and he is starting to socially isolate you. I am very concerned. Do you work currently? Because your first step needs to be getting your life in order so that you can pay for an apartment and your medications for yourself and move out. I would also get out of the house and call somewhere like the National Domestic Violence Hotline. He's not violent yet, but he's isolating you and destroying your property. I would bet good money on him becoming very abusive very soon. You deserve safety, and to be with someone who will take who you are as an individual seriously. "
"To add onto the friends part, I think he asked you not to tell anybody so he can start spreading his version of the story first and make you look like the bad guy. Maybe ask some of those mutual friends for help. Explain to them that he cheated on you, got combative and left. He isn't responding to your attempts at communication and you need help figuring out what to do with his dog. Dont pack up his stuff yet, he is still on the lease and I would call the police non-emergency line and see if they have any advise on the shared car."
"Thank you! I've seen situations like OPs happen *a lot* because the dude initially doesn't see the other women as a 'threat'. They don't see those interactions as genuine or real, just something hot to look at.
Try asking them if they'd be happy with their gfs fucking other guys - all of a sudden things seem different."
"I agree, but I have a problem with this:

&gt;I'm going to be watchful and make sure the behavior doesn't crop up anymore.

To me, she had a traumatizing experience as a child, she knows she majorly fucked up, she learned from this, she has done all the repentance she needs. This is a forgive and forget scenario.

Edit: Goodness, of course of something like this happens again, you're going to remember. But there's no need to be ""watchful."""
"I would ask S about it and let him know E brought it up again.  It's very strange that he's talking to her one on one and also inviting her out. 

The thing is,  people show you their true colors.  You just have to believe them.  If he's a good friend,  he will show you so.  If he's not,  well,  he'll show you that too. 

I think you're right in leaving the girl out of it.  She's not doing anything wrong and isn't committed to you. Your friend, on the other hand,  is seriously across the line with friend code. "
"On the flip side, your boyfriend sounds like he's very emotionally developed for a guy that young. Whenever I see ~~[23m]~~ [20m!] in a title in this sub, I've learned to expect pretty childish behavior, but your boyfriend was far more mature and courageous than, frankly, I would have been at his age. 

That they want you to break up with him speaks to the relationship they want with you: one in which you don't have anybody in your corner demonstrating what it's like to stand up for yourself and those you care about in a healthy way. They'll be eager to see him go because it won't take you much longer, it sounds like, to realize by contrast just how toxic they are."
You know why he cries and begs you to stay? Because that’s easier than actually getting his shit together. If you actually left him he would have to *do* things and be an adult. For your sake and your child’s (seriously dude won’t give up his game room so his child can have a room?) leave this dude.
"I mean it's a crime, he should be on a list so that my future daughter never get violated by him.

There is no excuse. If you don't report this to your friends and give them the chance to press charges or whatever they do you are guilty of the same felony as your husband...and if things ever go wrong one day, your name might end up right next to his on that list."
"""Too little too late"" comes to mind as well.

OP, this is actually a well known phenomenon. It's called ""walkaway wife syndrome"". It's when the wife spends years talking to her husband about getting her needs in the relationship met, begging, pleading, getting angry, crying, and so on - and nothing changes. Then she files for divorce and the husband goes, ""oh shit, you were being *serious* this whole time?*""* But the years of treating her like garbage have already taken their irreversible toll.

Let her go, get some counseling for yourself, and don't get into another relationship until you feel like you're ready to be an active participant in one."
"Have your husband sit down and rework your family budget with his new earnings. Tell him if he can show you that your family can afford it, you will be more supportive.   
Also tell him that if he doesn't want to let down the people in his life, that includes you and he'd be letting you down by taking this role. Suggest he offer to help his brother find a suitable candidate for the role instead. "
"If your happy be happy and stop worrying.  If your are not happy move on.    

Side note.  Live your life and stop comparing to other people."
"You both are very young, maybe she's not ready to be someone's support/cheerleader in down times or just hasn't developed the skills for that yet. Or maybe, you're asking for more than is reasonable, she is encouraging you when you are doing well. Perhaps that's how she's expressing support. 

You say you're anxious and you sound like you're ruminating on your insecurities. So this might be a bit more a you-issue than a her-thing. Find help for your anxiety from medical professionals. Your GF likely can't do enough there to stop these thoughts, so she'll always be in the shitty spot. "
"&gt;&gt;in the beginning of our relationship I didn't mind. I said I didn't remember him calling me a b**** before except once or twice in an argument, but then he drops the bomb on me that he made it a goal to call me a b**** at least once a day to humble me when we first got together since I was so pretty and he thought I was shoved up my own a.

No, you're not overreacting at all. It's a trash thing to do, to take on someone's self-esteem because you think they are too confident."
"I did in the last month because our sex life had changed. Afterwards because of his messed up behavior when we broke up, I started wondering if he had been cheating throughout because he's clearly full of shit."
"Get her a camera for her entryway, inside and out. "
"&gt;That she needs to see this kid and stay with us for her mental health

So, your husband flat out admits that he basically expects you to be able to care for a newborn AND his mother. Fuck that noise. You aren't being unreasonable at all. Your husband is. If his mother needs help for her mental health then she needs to see a professional for it, not you or the baby. "
"""Ellie, I am over this shit. I have been over this shit for more than a year. If you still think I need to be upset or angry or anything that you seem to want me to be, that's on you, that's YOUR thought process. The next time you try to drag me into a fight that is non-existent, I will leave you to it.""

Because really, is Ellie that good of a friend if she's trying to make this into A Thing?"
"I'd just say I've thought about it and I'm not really sure I see much reason to have a family talk. If they want to get together in order to spend time together, that's great, but that if she has negative feelings she wants to discuss with me she can do that on the phone without dragging my wife into it. However, I would also caution her that if the negative feelings are about one of the happiest days of my life, that those are here's to manage and that I'm not really interested in discussing them."
"For what it's worth, I don't think that look your boyfriend gave you was pity. Pity has an undercurrent of ""I'm glad that's not me!"".

I highly suspect the look he gave you was one of deep empathy. Empathy is not just feeling bad *for* anther person, but feeling the pain *with* you.  He understands and cares about your hurt and wishes he could take that pain away... That is empathy, not pity.

It may seem like a small distinction, but it's an important one."
"What the f------? 

This is like a scripted scene from a horror movie! 

He SHOULD have ""insecurities"" about deliberately and callously inflicting PAIN on someone who is trusting him with her safety and her friggin' LIFE when she's in the car. He should be shattered and checked into a 72 hour hold right now, because something is deeply, deeply wrong with him. 

This sadistic ""test"" of how much you'll tolerate (which this bullsh*t about a defensive mechanism is covering up) is the OPENING BELL of a relationship of escalating physical and emotional abuse. 

This made me ill with rage to read. 

So many women and men out there don't do this kind of thing. Please walk away from this person. He's RIGHT. He DOESN'T deserve you. He deserves jail time for assault and a long hard think about why he thinks it's okay to harm women for his jollies. 

"
"Your husband is a piece of shit.

Sorry for the bluntness, but I'm so sick and tired of reading posts like this where the OP is being ***so obviously*** disrespected.

Do you realize what this would be teaching your children about relationships? 
"I was looking for this comment! 

I'm not Brazilian, but it sure does sound like a crappy excuse. 

Cultural differences or not, there are more and less open people everywhere. OP stated his boundaries and she kept crossing them. That's what counts. It seems they are not compatible and she cannot grasp where his boundaries are. Or won't. Unless OP wants to keep getting his feelings hurt, he should cut his losses. "

&gt; I know her well enough to know she's not being malicious.

If OP doesn't think what Ellie is doing to this girl is malicious, I'd hate to see what her definition of ""malicious"" is."
"&gt; I told her there's only two options that she either accepts this or we end this and she finds someone who gives her what she wants.

I don't see any other way honestly.  What's worse is that if she takes option ""1"", your marriage will be miserable anyway.

Regardless of how this ends up, you should get a vasectomy.  Not because she will try and trick you, but it confirms your choice and there's no reason to introduce ANY risk of something you definitely don't want."
"Lol, when I was 18, I took my first trip out of the country by myself without my parents to Canada to meet a guy (18) I met on an online video game and whom I've never videochatted with and had only seen one picture of. He even joked that he was going to kidnap me. I still went and here we are together three years later, LOL."
"No, that's not weird.  I don't even think it is all that unusual.  

I think you're getting hung up on the twin aspect.  So what if you and your sister and these two guys are two sets of twins.  It doesn't matter.  

Yeah, people will make predictable dumb Doublemint Gum jokes, but there's nothing wrong with two sets of twins dating.  People don't care about a pair of siblings dating another pair of siblings, and that is all this is, too.

If you like him, why not go ahead and date?  It's not like you're signing a contract in blood.  It's just spending time together and getting to know each other and maybe something more will develop and maybe not.

"
"My sister has - on more than one occasion within my hearing - said our sister-in-law is the sister she never had.

Not quite as critical as a parent, but yeah - that is the absolute worst.  I'm so sorry you had to go through that.  How painful and mortifying."
"There is always the possibility that it could be something insidious, but honestly I think he knew that it would sound weird and was embarrassed for people’s reactions. Look at your reaction. Look at most commenter reactions. People think guys being naked together is inherently weird. Your joke to break the ice was placing judgement to be honest. I think I would get defensive immediately too if someone came at me with “ you’re doing this hobby? Isn’t there a more normal version you could be doing instead?” That’s essentially what you were saying when you bring up clothed yoga right away, it really isn’t a joke at all it’s a voicing of dislike for the nakedness. 

I would see if you can find any info about this group in particular online, more info could let you know if it’s legit or some kind of cheating. Also if you bring up the conversation with him again (which I think is a good thing to do because if it is innocent he shouldn’t feel like he has to be defensive with you) you should start by saying something like “I’m sorry if it seemed like I was judging your activity choice, I was just surprised you haven’t mentioned it to me before! I would love to meet some of the friends you have made, maybe we can go out for dinner some time.” If he gets defensive about you meeting them i would consider that a red flag. If that convo is going well maybe ask him what he likes about that yoga in  particular since there are so many different yoga’s to choose from (but don’t make it a clothed vs no clothed thing, there is hot yoga for example that is different from regular yoga). "
"Also, did he only tell OP because the ex got pregnant?? "
"Make sure they know why you avoid your brother. Then Tell them they need to choose: either they have family events with him, or with you. You will not be around if he’s around. Obviously, this runs the risk of them choosing him, but at least you’ll know. And if they refuse to choose, as most parents probably would, make the choice for them and don’t go."
"Are you me, OP? I am a planner and I dated a guy like this who didn't plan things and didn't seem to prioritize special events. After five years, it didn't get better and I was still the one putting the majority of the effort in. I ended it in June.

I recommend you seriously re-evaluate if this is what you want for the rest of your life because if you stay with this guy, you will end up putting in 95% of the effort. You deserve a guy who sees the value in putting in effort to the relationship."
Can I have this man too?
I think the real issue is that he is a verbally abusive asshole...
"By the same token what is there to lose by straight up calling him out on his actions first? Just straight up ask what do you want? Not having closure a second time round would suck considering how hard it was the first time. From there YOU have all the control. YOU decide if you want to give him a second chance if that is what he wants. YOU decide to block him if he gives you some lame ass apology. Put yourself first and do exactly what you want to do. That being said, if you want to block him straight away then do that too. I just think asking him and telling him - no BS, what do you want - will get to the bottom of things quicker than dancing around on social media for days or weeks. Good luck OP this is hard for sure. "
I read your previous posts. Your bf is not a good person and many redditors already told you. Please start to think about what kind of future you see for this relationship.
"He hurt you, admitted he meant to do it, and you need Internet strangers to tell you what to do?

You in danger, girl."
"Regardless of whether she’s your biological mother - she has lost all rights to you - and therefore I believe it’s a really tricky area for her to be posting identifying pictures of minors online without their legal guardians permission.

You don’t deserve that kind of thing. Please take care of yourself. 

Lots of love. "
"&gt;and told me I was very mature for my age

That is the calling card of men who want to exploit young/ underage women.  

Source:  at the dawn of the internet, older men hurled that at me in chat rooms nearly every day.  A few family friends who weren't really friendly and were actually alcoholics who wanted to fuck me also spouted that one off at me.  

You are rapidly approaching the age where plenty of men your age will share your interest in philosophy, especially as you get into college.  Go date college boys and let this predator go.  

Edit:  

&gt;pseudo intellectual, which I understand, but it still kind of irked me. Since then he threw out a couple of the books I was reading, and when I got mad at him for it he said he didn't want me to waste my time on things that don't matter and that I should spend more time with him.

You're not a psuedo intellectual.  You are an intellectual (if you want to be one).  Fuck this guy.  He is trying to destroy your self esteem and keep you from getting an education because he is terrified that you'll (rightfully) wise up and dump him.  

Never, ever, ever let a man get between you and an education.  Ever.  I don't care if all you want to do is read books in a library and not go for a traditional education - any man worth fucking will support you in improving your mind.  
"
"You probably aren't going to change their minds, sad to say. Some families are pretty hectic. Sometimes it's about race, other times it's about class or some other subculture and it seems some families are just an ecosystem of toxicity.

If you like him enough you're best bet is to block it out and avoid them. You guys are all that matters at the end of the day. However they will try to stir up trouble. That's inevitable with toxic families. "
"&gt; Do I just suck it up, accept that my parents won't support me and get loans like most other people? 

I'd do this. They're trying use the money to tank your relationship with your brother and punish you for having a relaitonship with him. But they've also immediately ruined the relationship you have with them too, because you know now where you stand with them - and where you stand is never being able to trust them ever again. "
"Get some therapy. You went through some pretty traumatic experiences, and this was one of your ways of coping.

I don't believe you're weak. I believe you've had a challenging situation that covered the last part of your life.

I'd recommend seeing if you can find someone who specialises in working with people who have been through trauma."

Your mother is angry with you because she’s projecting the terrible shame she feels about letting her baby grandson live in a hoarder house and be eaten alive by insects. She’s mad at herself for being a shitty grandma. Call CPS.

"I don't know you OP so I can't tell you what you're doing wrong.


But if you're saying stuff like this:

&gt;not a lot of men like women who read a lot


It feels like you're in middle school trying to impress boys.


Instead of being a 32 year old woman trying to find a guy you like. 



Learn to stand on your own and people will gravitate towards you.



And stop it with the age thing. If you're surrounded by men trying to date 20 year olds you're surrounded by the wrong men."
"Not this.  Flatmates are just that, you may socialise in the lounge together but you don't sniff each other randomly. It's super weird. "
"This is a sort of a petty revenge kind of suggestion mixed with my opinion that girls need to look out for each other more and stand up to the sexually wrong things that guys do to girls but.... I think you should just send a screen shot of his text, about asking to fuck you before dating this girl, to the girl. so she knows. I’d want to know something like that before I started dating a total POS"
"Idk it's tricky, because I truly think I'm actually my mom's favorite, but she never really stuck up for me with stuff like this. Always insisting my father loved us equally and it was just my skewed perception. 

A lot of what you've written is spot-on though. I can't remember a time I didn't feel left out at my very core. About 5 years ago my sister got insanely drunk (she has a mean streak when she's drunk, but she doesn't remember saying any of this) and told me that I'd ruined the family. That her and my brother always wished that my parents had stopped after her. 4's a family, 5's a crowd. 
"
"I, uh...yeah, wow. Tip of the hat to you for keeping your cool amidst a bucket of crazy.

However! Despite being insanely uncomfortable, it seems like you do need to discuss this with your husband. Not to reconsider your answer in the slightest, but your husband should be aware that this happened. After all, your BIL's next conversation with him might well be, ""So...given it any further thought?"" """"What?"" ""You know, the orgy."" And then it goes downhill from there. Letting him be blindsided on that is no bueno.

Also, there's also the matter that this is kind of an unwanted sexual advance on both of you. Goddamn, this is weird."
Thinking housework is for woman is a huge red flag.
"How long was the onset of his symptoms after he was left alone with the drink? How long did his symptoms last until he calmed down? I've done a variety of psychedelic drugs in the past (and drugs in general) and oral consumption of drugs very often doesn't hit you instantly, because it can take a while for your body to break them down. I'm gonna list a few of the most common psychedelics: Acid, 2CB, 25i all last for a long time (6 hours+). Mushrooms you would taste. Salvia and DMT won't work orally. This is only psychedelics, some other drugs can cause hallucinations as side effects (MDMA if you take a lot, diphenhydramine if you take a lot, DXM (robitussin) if you take a lot) but you would certainly notice the taste or crushed up pills. 

This is purely from a drugs standpoint. Sure she might take a lot of drugs, but it would be very hard to spike someone with a hallucinogen. The most common spiking drugs are GHB, GBL, and rohypnol, none of which can cause hallucinations (they make people feel/act as if they are extremely drunk, heavy and tired). 

I don't know why this event in particular would set him off, but he has a history of hallucinations and being violent. Perhaps if this event hadn't happened, then something else would've affected him. I can understand completely why you're suspicious of her, and I definitely think it's time to cut her off as she's a terrible friend and a huge stressor on your husband. But I would say it's unlikely that she did spike the drink. Unless, of course, he gradually started to hallucinate over the period of an hour and then it lasted for many hours. Psychedelic drugs in general are different kinds of hallucinations than psychotic hallucinations, in that you can tell that they're fake (apart from benadryl/diphenydramine). Although I've never suffered from psychosis so I'm not sure how they would manifest in a person that has suffered from psychosis in the past. I hope that this information helps in some way. It definitely wouldn't hurt to talk to your husband's psychologist/psychiatrist, therapist and doctor in order to get him the best possible help. And cut out that awful woman! I'm so sorry that both you and him had to go through this ordeal. You sound like a wonderful partner who cares about him very much.

Your dad's condition is vastly more important than your sister's MILs' feelings. Prioritise.

Talk to him and ask him."

Your son sounds exactly like me. I LOVE my time alone. The more, the better. I’ve always been this way, and I am not going to change. 

I have a couple of close friends that I see occasionally. My boyfriend and I live together. Thank god, he’s an introvert like me, so we get along on that aspect well. I have a very sociable job and that’s enough for me. 

He sounds really well adjusted. Don’t worry about him. Get worried if he has no job or school and sits in his room alone 24/7. "
"""Mom, Dad, you can decide whatever you like with your money. I wish my sister the best. I will not beg from anyone; not you, not my brother, nobody.

Just be sure you've saved up for your own retirement and burial, as I will have my hands full providing for my own family."""
Staying in the bride and groom's room ON THEIR WEDDING NIGHT? No. Noooooooo.
"You said she never mentioned him after the accident. It's all coming up now because she can't keep it buried anymore. The stresses around her were too much and now she has to confront those unresolved feelings. She's not still in love with *him*, it's those old emotions that have a hold on her right now. It's like she's right back when it happened and everything is still fresh. 

The only thing I can possibly suggest is therapy for her so she can start to unpack all this shit. It's a lot. No wonder she's breaking. So, you can help by trying to be a little bit compassionate. Don't judge her for how she feels, just be there for her. She kinda needs to go through this right now. Holding on to all that grief and pain isn't healthy by any stretch."
"&gt;How do I convince my husband I love him and believe him, and that I'm not going anywhere? 

You convince him through your actions.  Treat him the same as you were and support him in forgiving himself.  Show your love a little extra for the next couple of weeks; whatever his love language is, focus on that.  Hopefully time will help heal this wound.  

&gt;How can I encourage him to go to a doctor to see if Sara did this

I think he should go to the doctor regardless.  Either Sara drugged him and they can do a test (hopefully it's still in his system) or he works with his doctors/therapists to rework his care regime."
"Problem with that if OP's parents are like they describe, that will burn a professional bridge for sure. ""Dude, your parents are horrendous."""

That alone is reason enough to dump him. It was him, no question about it but instead of being honest and owning up to it, he not only continues to lie to your face, but does it in a way that makes him out to be a hero. Why the fuck would he think *pretending* to be the one who did it would make you feel better? He’s despicable.

"Hey! I was raised one of jehovahs witnesses! My father was the head of our congregation, and was a big shot in our district. I was a full time missionary by the age of 16, and my mom homeschooled me and cheated my way through the last couple years of high school so I could focus on preaching full time. 

I’m now married to an atheist with a physics degree. 

When I first left the cult, my husband (then friend) was the first person I had really opened up to about beliefs. The brainwashing of JWs is serious, and very damaging. Certain ideas are drilled into our brains as fact, and they are very hard to uproot. One of those is that this entire world is controlled by the devil. Every single thing about the world and it’s people is designed to lure you away from god so that you will be destroyed in Armageddon. Like a giant trap. And the only way to be saved is to shut out the world ENTIRELY and only expose yourself to gods true organization: the JWs. 

When I was first kicked out, I didn’t fully realize how much of a scam their teachings were. I was still terrified of all the people I met, because I had been raised to think that every non-jw was trying to taint my heart so that I would die. So just understand that it may be hard for him to be constantly surrounded by people that he feels he can’t trust. 

It took me a very long time to start to do research on my own. And my husband took a VERY back seat to that process, so as to not influence my outcome. He focused on asking questions, not giving answers. Jehovahs Witnesses focus a lot on “love”. Even though so much of their doctrine is the opposite of love. So when he asked questions they would usually be along the lines of: “is it loving to tell gay people that they can never marry?” 

He also asked me things like “have you really researched this topic yourself? Or have you just been taking someone’s word as fact?” Which prompted me to do my own research. We focused a lot on looking at both sides of every topic and deciding which side was A) factual and B) loving/compassionate. So maybe when you discuss things with him, try your best to offer him the other side of the argument and how both sides feel. Example: “Pro life believers feel that each life is precious, including a fetus. And that isn’t our right to make the decision of life or death for another being. On the other hand, pro choice believers feel compassion towards the mother, and feel that it’s fundamentally wrong to force someone to carry a child that they aren’t ready for.” And let him come to his own conclusions."

"Nah, I've never felt suspicious about their friendship before. My boyfriend has never shown signs of infidelity, nor has Jess. I suppose I got a bit paranoid because I have an irrational fear of abandonment and pretty low self-esteem. Thanks for your reply- logically, everything's fine and I would rather have him comfort her at a time like that than be cold because he's afraid of crossing a line or whatever.   


I try to be a good friend, Jess has always been an amazing friend. I never thought that *she* did anything wrong in this scenario, I was afraid that my partner had- she'd never cheat or do anything of that nature because she's far too moral. I will invite her over for it, I liked her father too. I reckon my takeaway should be that, though she puts on a strong front, she is struggling intensely inside and she needs her friends right now.

"I mean, what you're describing isn't grey rocking, it's avoiding. Grey rocking is participating in social interactions with the person but being as surface level civil as possible, not giving details about your life or feelings (or whatever your problem with that person is) and not asking too many questions and not really moving past small talk and not initiating new stuff with them (like not calling them or inviting them for coffee). It's supposed to be a method used to continue social interactions with the person (say a partner of a sibling) without escalating any drama. Grey rocking in your situation would be you very quietly continuing with life around your sister 'how are you? good. up to much? not really. I did blah blah blah. That's nice'. Grey rocking is supposed to a be a method that makes you very hard to criticise as you're not doing anything objectionable, you are engaging in conversation and being pleasant. It puts the antagonistic person on the back-foot as they're not getting what they want out of the interaction (drama/conflict) but they can't do much about it without making it obvious that's their goal.   


What you're doing is escalating drama because it's very clear you're avoiding and ignoring your sister - which is easily criticised behaviour even if you/others/I think it's perfectly valid given the circumstances. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's childish. But it's certainly an escalation and obvious 'move' which is the opposite of what grey rocking is supposed to be. Like, you can't live in a house with your mom and part time with your sister and expect you actively avoiding your sister to not be noticed or addressed. If you want this situation to go smoother you have to actually implement grey rocking or have conversations about this and not just bail out when you disagree/get angry/get frustrated."
"Staples for uneven housecare topics are Emma: 'you should've asked' and 'My wife divorced me because i left the dishes by the sink'. You're not the first couple running into this issue.

Why are these messes caused, why aren't they cleaned up, what are your expectations and such. Then perhaps you can make a chorewheel. "
"&gt; until she apologizes 

And even then I wouldn't have unsupervised visits. If she apologizes she can come see him at your house with you or your husband present. She can easily give a meaningless apology just to have access to him. "
"20 years ago, I was in your position. Fresh out of college. You need to establish boundaries and authority from minute one. If they move into your space, step back and tell them not to do that again. If they try to kiss you, write them up. Sexual jokes? Disciplinary action. Shut that shit down *immediately*. Be strict. Be authoritative. Take control the second you step into the room. Let it be known under no uncertain terms will you put up with any of this. You don't have to be a witch. But you do have to take control and get these kids to see you as an authority figure. Good luck, hang in there and shoot me a message if you want to get some ideas, vent, or just talk! Been in your shoes and you can take control back! :)"
He can warn that realtor ahead of time and they can decide whether they want to take them on. A jr. realtor would be perfect because they don't have the client base and probably are desperate for business.
"Some people: Okay with drugs

Other people: Not okay with drugs

You are fundamentally two different people. This is likely a dealbreaker for your relationship. "
"Yes.  That's why she really needs to be in counseling herself.  She's always accommodated his flirting as the price to keep him.  It hasn't worked though, he's actively cheating now and it's time for her to realize that."
"&gt; A bit of backstory: My girlfriend came from an abusive relationship with a serial cheater.  

It's understandable that she'd have some lingering hangups about being cheated on, but to equate your looking at another girl as cheating is a little much in my opinion. 

You mentioned that you actively go out of your way to avoid looking at women, so much so that it makes your daily interactions awkward. Moving forward, is she going to flip out and break up with you every time you have to have a conversation with a female coworker? Overreact when you order lunch from a female cashier at Starbucks? 

&gt; She has a strong set belief that men are incapable of true loyalty in relationships, to the point where she has set plans that, on my birthday from age 30 on, she wants me to spend a night with a different girl to ""satisfy"" me.     
&gt;  
&gt;Now when I complement her she shudders and asks ""really? Do you even find me attractive?"" ""Am I enough for you?"" 

This is disturbing. She needs to work on herself and her insecurities before she can ever have a healthy, mutually satisfying relationship with *anyone*. "
"It's laughable that all the comments here are ""oh well at least he was honest with you""

First of all, he was not honest with her. He lied to her face for a few days before he felt guilty enough to tell her about it.

Also, would you guys be using the same lame excuse if he had slept with the stripper?

The standard set for straight men in relationships is so low it's pathetic."
Yeah no. I’m the youngest of 4 and the big room got passed down once someone left for college so it ended with me. I’d be so upset if my dad did these things for my sister and not me.
"Congrats, you found a Nice Guy. Go to the sub r/niceguys if you need to calm down a bit. There's a lot of men like this so please, do not let him make you feel like shit. He's never been your friend so no need to feel bad about it."

"First, check out r/AlAnon. Second, my husband is in recovery. 18 months sober. We barely survived his addiction. You have three choices: 1) Wait it out and hope he hits bottom and decides to get help, 2) Leave him, or 3) Stay and ignore the problem. You will not be able to convince him to get sober. The addiction speaks louder than you ever will. If I had to relive my husband's drinking days over again,  we would split up. It was hard, and he didn't think drinking a bottle of vodka everyday was bad. I would say option 3 is a terrible idea, and option 1 may be as well. He's just not in a place where he can fully love you, not when the alcohol is there. "
Sounds like she could benefit from therapy. Your niece's generation was basically screwed over and lots of people her age are still figuring out their career paths- we got a much later start on things because of the 08 crash and student loans and horrible job markets etc etc. I'm 30 and still figuring out my career. People and jobs will understand. 
"Don't make your wife be there as a buffer. Go without her for the day or two before Christmas and then come back for your own holiday. Your parents will just have to deal (and maybe learn to say no to their horrible neighbors now that there's a consequence to ""you are the company you keep"")"
They’re the ones cutting ties. After you’re married your loyalty should be to your husband and it won’t be fair to bring him around them if they’re going to treat him like a second-class citizen. That goes double if you have kids. Nothing will appease them short of him “converting.” 
"&gt; I don't wanna create another fight between him and his brother, especially after 3 years of peace.

Of all the fights you ever didn't create, you didn't create this one the most.

Your husband was invited too, right?  It's not like BIL expected him NOT to know about it.

Besides, it would be poor form to receive someone else's invitation to an event and not pass it along to the intended recipient.  /s"
"Yeah that’s really bad, a crime and a severe violation of trust. Also, his explanation is wholly inadequate. So he was intimidated by females ... 10 years ago? He’s been with you for 10 years! And still feels the need to do this. Probably because he gets off on violating people’s privacy. That’s disgusting. OP, this is in no way your fault and i hope you find the strength to get out of there and inform the people whose images he stole, perhaps the police as well. "
"So, here's the thing:


In order to respect someone, you don't *need* to understand. You need to hear when you're told: ""this is disrespectful and hurting me and needs to stop"".


So what he's telling you here is not that he doesn't understand, but that he doesn't care about the effects of his actions on you."
"This is probably a cultural thing, but I would find receiving this kind of a card from a business contact extremely strange, childish, unprofessional, possibly inappropriate, and would be left confused about the relationship between the 'husband' and 'wife'. 

Perhaps this is funny to your husband &amp; colleagues, but is it funny to the *audience*, i.e. professional contacts? Are they in on the joke? Will they get the joke when they receive the card? Or is this just an inside joke between the team and the clients will be left confused about what the joke is? Maybe this viewpoint will help with discussions with husband. It's not just about your feelings but also about what they are trying to achieve with the card, except sniggering among themselves. 

And, yes, your husband should also respect your feelings on this matter. "
[deleted]
Frankly if my parents couldn't support my husband who is my life partner and the father of my children I would cut them out. I've done it in the past. This is who your choice is of life partner. If they want you in their life they can either accept it or have neither of you in their lives which includes any kids too. It's about respect and so far they have none for you. They don't need to fund anything if they feel that way but non attendance isn't an optional thing. 
"That’s the first thing I thought of, after feeling like I wanted to vomit. I feel like it might be more likely she’d choose one of those shady kidnapper ones since she’s not a legal guardian. 

MIL definitely gets cut off, beef up locks and home security, hell, I’d consult a lawyer, too. 

I really wouldn’t wait until husband gets home to tell him about this."
It was a totally uncalled for response. Not something a friend would say to another friend. He tried to put you down for no reason.
&gt; Throwing things when angry is ~~a huge red flag~~ abusive
"Honey, if your daughter came home to you one day and told you she's just started dating this guy and then told you ALL the things you wrote down, what would you say to her? "
"Your flippant answer here is so telling. You still don't understand her. It was only until there were actual consequences to you that you decided to make a feeble attempt at a relationship with your wife. Even the way you frame the counselor--that it's on her because she's not willing to go, shows you don't get it.

She's done.

After years of rejection and doing all the heavy lifting in the relationship while you laid around like a slob she's done. It's not that she hates you or wishes you ill. It's worse than that. She doesn't care. She stopped trying to jump through hoops to get your attention. Good for her. She deserves someone who genuinely respects relationships and will care about her."

"""When you said you were removing yourself from the card, I assumed you went ahead with your intentions to do so.

"I agree with every word you said. 

So. Many. Red. Flags. 

The jokes about being left alone together are definitely NOT jokes. 

OP, you have every right to be more upset than you currently are. "
"She’s been posting about this dude their entire relationship and every thread she says “yeah you guys are right, we need to break up” and then posts another one a few months later. It’s really sad. "
"Have you been to therapy by yourself, FOR yourself? Because maybe you should start there because as much as you want to save this, you can't do it if HE won't put in the effort and it looks like he doesn't care to try.
"
"She wasn't joking. She was being emotionally abusive. Instead of engaging with the actual problem (that she *knowingly hurts you*), she's set up a false dichotomy where your only choices are to accept her treatment unquestioningly or break up. It makes you feel like *you're* the one bullying *her*, and it takes the responsibility off her to change. 

Although at this point, it looks like those are your only real options. You've asked her to change, and she'd decided to keep hurting you instead. You can either keep letting her tear you down (and I hope you don't) or you can walk. "
"Do you guys do date nights anymore? Just the two of you, without the kids?"
"Your GF's best friend isn't the problem.  What you have is a girlfriend problem.  Don't blame the best friend.  Your girlfriend hasn't established any boundaries with the best friend.  

It's real hard to have a monogamous relationship when there are three people in the relationship - which it appears there are to a degree.  Let your GF know that cancelling plans like that isn't acceptable.  Point out every time that she has cut your plans short or canceled due to her best friend.  Tell her that her friend is an attention seeking succubus.  Tell her that if she continues to let your relationship be used as a punching bag and second priority that a breakup will happen.

And next time - when it happens - immediately break up.  Just look at her and say ""I told you she would do this again.  We are over."" and walk away.

Or just walk away.  But I would give her one last chance if only so you can make a dramatic exit and help her realize what her friend is really doing."
"I would rather die single than be in your relationship. I'm 1000% serious. I would actually pay money, NOT to be in your relationship.

This guy doesn't respect you and get off on treating you like a servant. You will not change him or ""make him understand."" *He already understands.* That's why he is doing it. It's pleasurable for him to demean you. And he pressures sex acts on you that he knows you don't like? You do it as some ""transactional"" thing like for dinners?? YUCK.

I'm sorry you are willing to stay in this situation that demeans your self respect. I truly feel pity for you. Honestly, reading about your relationship makes me feel a bit queezy.

"My husband likes video games.  A lot.  But if I burn myself cooking or gatve a headache, he's there in an instant."
"You're the side piece, probably."
"Can confirm. My ex (we were together 4 years) doesn’t have money for child support but he has plenty for weed for all his mates and alcohol and take out.. in our 4 years together I’ve gotten a total of 3 gifts... 2 of which were asked for. One was unexpected.. out of those 4 years his mates received birthday presents every year.... this year alone he Spent $250 on pot to make hash brownies for all his mates for one of their 20th... not to mention all the other alcohol etc he’s bought them. didn’t have any money on my bday for even a card but had $70 put aside for weed... now I’m going for sole custody and looking at a DVO. 😑 

People like this don’t change. We broke up 4 months ago and myself and our kids STILL aren’t a priority to him. Cut your loses. Move on. Seriously it’s better for you in the long run. "
"When the situation was only hurting her, you didn't think it was important.

Now that there's an actual consequence that hurts *you*, suddenly it's an all-hands-on-deck, five-alarm emergency. 

The only thing you're demonstrating is that you were completely capable of getting your ass in gear all that time, you just didn't give enough of a shit about your wife. You're adding insult on top of injury. You had 7 years to fix this and didn't bother. Sometimes when you let that window close, it doesn't reopen. Take this as a lesson for your next relationship and don't let this happen again."
"This is so cute, I want to cry. Stubborn man refuses to love cats.. secretly loves them anyway. "
"I mean you can chalk most things up to being a picky eater, or even that she only wants to eat the foods she was raised on, but this

&gt; Then gets frustrated, saying things like ""I fucked up...I should have gotten.."" but in a very angry and upset way. When this happens its almost impossible to even enjoy my meal since she's miserable and I have to calm her down. 

suggests way deeper anxiety, and maybe even shame in some way. I would talk to her more about food habits and experiences from when she was growing up, or have her talk to a professional about them. She might have learned the dramatic reaction thing from a parent, or she may have internalized a lot of baggage about wasting food or wasting money that she doesn't understand is dysfunctional and is manifesting itself in a bizarre EDNOS situation.

"I left my emotionally abusive ex four years ago and am the proud single mum of our five year old autistic daughter.

I second-guessed my decision so many times (and even slept with my ex a couple of times also) until the day my mum said “he hasn’t just hurt you, Diggsworm, he has *damaged* you.” It hit me like a freight train. He really had. And I was reminded why I left. I had reasons, so many reasons and I resolved that I would *never* risk being damaged like that ever again. I would never let him make me feel like a piece of shit again. I would never risk my daughter’s happiness growing up in such a toxic environment, thinking that seeing her mum cry every day was “the norm”. Nope. No way. 

It was bloody hard, so hard, but I made it through. And it sounds wanky, but I really did find this inner strength I didn’t know I had in me and I’m telling you that you have it as well. You are 100% doing the right thing. It’s scary turning your whole world upside down but I guarantee you it’s worth it. Your child will thrive growing up with a happy mum. There are so many good times ahead, please believe me...and the best part is that YOU get to create them. You are in charge of your life now. You are in change of your happiness and you get to call the shots. You can do this.
"
"I know you said you've talked about the situation, but was part of that a discussion about what kind of support or behavior is helpful or more desirable to you when you're feeling low?

Part of developing mature relationships is learning to ask for what you want and need. I think we've all had a moment of ""but if you really loved me you'd just KNOW that I need..,"" but that's unrealistic and unreasonable. She can't read your mind, and shouldn't be expected to. 

Some people want to be left alone when they feel bad, some people just want company, some people want to be asked about how they're feeling, some people want their partner to distract them, some people want to be brought a cup of tea and cuddled, etc.

If you tell your girlfriend exactly what you want or need from her, and she STILL won't or can't give it to you, it sounds like you're just not the right partners for each other."
"I'm stumped about advice about the sister in law, but can I just say that these are the loveliest examples of pranks I've heard of in a long time? 

Pranks are very often at least slightly mean, and I hate that kind of prank. But there is nothing mean about the examples you give. These are pranks that leave everybody happy afterwards. 

Only thing I can think of to do with your sister in law is - maybe sit her down and ask her how she sees your family traditions. And really listen before trying to change her mind about them. Maybe she grew up with mean pranksters and is projecting, who knows. Ask her to name one occasion where the recipient of a prank in your family seemed uphanppy about it afterwards. "
"Your feelings are important here too OP and if this is eating away at you, talk to your dad. I understand that your family is going through a lot, but that doesn't mean that your feelings aren't important here."
"It makes sense.

This is really one of those situations where there's no 'right' decision. He may find other father/ parent figures in his life who will do him well, or he may not.

My personal advice is do what makes you feel the most comfortable. There's no point forcing yourself to interact with him if it makes you miserable. He'd pick up on your discomfort eventually, &amp; it's better not being a parent than being in his life but dislike spending any time with him."
L E A V E - there is NO excuse for infidelity. Lack of closure or whatever is a bullshit excuse to make himself feel better. You will only grow to resent him more and more... 
"&gt; From my experience, not a lot of men like women who read a lot.

That right there tells me that you've been going after the wrong type of man for you. 

"
I left a 5 year relationship because he was a lazy fuck who wouldn't lift a finger around the house. It doesn't get any better so you have a decision to make. 
"She handled this extremely poorly. She lied to you, decided without your input what she thinks is ""best"" for you and your child. Not to mention she showed up with the kid without warning. If you reacted poorly out of shock, it could have traumatized the kid. She really has no idea what she's doing.

Talk to a lawyer first."
Absolutely call CPS! Those are neglectful parents 
"&gt; She was telling me, but not straight up.

This is you making excuses.   Dude, you forgot her birthday!   10 years together and you forgot her birthday.   Just stop with all of your excuses.  You had a good thing and you blew it.   Accept responsibility and let her go."
"No, don't invite her. In fact, if anything, you should be distancing yourself from her because you have become her enabler in a way. She is an adult and it's not healthy for you to constantly be reassuring her. "
"&gt;I don't have proof but I suspected he was cheating throughout

You suspected him during the relationship?"
"&gt;It all came to a head when two months ago I forgot her birthday. It was a huge fuckup, not just because I forgot **but because I asked her why she didn’t remind me.**

oh *dude*. Read a few paragraphs I've attached about ""walkaway wife syndrome"". She's done with you.

&gt;What is the “Walkaway Wife Syndrome?”

&gt;In the early years of some marriages, women tend to be the relationship caretakers. They may be more likely to strive for closeness and connection in the partnership. If their husbands aren't responsive, wives may begin to voice their concerns or needs. Their husbands may view this as “complaining” and disregard what their wives are asking for. Instead of responding to these requests for closeness and connection, men may choose to disconnect and retreat, which causes the marriage to deteriorate even more.

&gt;After years of trying unsuccessfully to improve things, a wife may eventually surrender and convince herself that change isn't possible. She may end up believing there's absolutely nothing she can do because nothing’s worked so far; and she begins to carefully map out the logistics of what she considers to be the inevitable - a divorce.

&gt;While she's planning her escape, she no longer tries to improve her relationship or modify her partner's behavior in any way. She resigns herself to living in silent desperation until ""D Day."" Unfortunately, her husband may view his wife's silence as an indication that ""everything is fine."" After all, the ""complaining"" has ceased. That's why, when she finally breaks the news of the impending divorce, her shell-shocked partner replies, ""I had no idea you were unhappy.""

**EDIT:** OP, you asking your wife to remind you about *her own birthday* is a classic example of a man expecting his wife to do his emotional labor for him, which is not something an adult should expect another adult to do. To learn more about the concept of emotional labor, google ""Emily you should've asked""."
"Yes, you have a right to be annoyed (and worried). 
Drinking to the point of **alcohol poisoning and needing hospitalization** is not normal, and not something that most people *ever* do. "
Sounds like a psycho to me. If she keeps popping up get a restraining order. Good luck. 
"The problem is that because OP isn't the favorite, excuses will be made for her sister about why she can't help while OP will be told she's selfish for not stepping up. OP won't be obligated to help, but that won't stop them from trying to guilt her into it."
"This is super important, OP, and may be the most practical advice here. You're smart to be concerned about relying overly much on a young romantic relationship, but the answer isn't to let these folks get away with treating you like they do. I cannot believe they'd be upset with you for standing up for yourself. Your brother created that conflict, whole cloth. Seeking to exit the situation was about the least dramatic thing you and your boyfriend could do once brother picked the fight. I have no idea what your blood relatives expected you to do there, and strongly suspect they would put the blame on you no matter what you had done."
"I know her well enough to know she's not being malicious. I think I did a bad job explaining. By trying to pick fights between me and this girl, I just mean little things like, asking me where my husband is in front of her, or asking to see my wedding ring and then twiddling it around my finger. Just like \*rubbing it in\* type stuff. Which maybe would have been funny 1 year+ ago but now is just super weird and uncomfortable and feels like dragging up the past. I think she (Ellie) does this because she thinks it'll make me feel better or to give me a self esteem boost or make me feel more assured in my relationship, all of which is totally unnecessary, and a little demeaning to imply that it's needed."
"Let me spell this out for you.  My teenage daughter treats me better than your ""friend"" does.  Seriously.

What you do is stop enabling her and learn to say no and mean it.  Go find someone who understands what a friend actually is.  Honestly, if you were in a car accident and needed help would she bring you food?  Clean your house for you?  Bring you to medical appointments?  "
You're leaving in 3 weeks?  Completely ignore this asshole and her party.  Anyone that doesn't understand that can go scratch too.
You are absolutely valid in feeling pissed about this and if he’s trying to explain it away then he’s not taking responsibility for his actions. 
"Yeah, he's already talked OP into getting a dog, then abandoned it, and his responsibilities. Problems like that usually get worse. "
"&gt; If you know where he lives, drop off his dog &amp; stuff.

I'd bet you $10 that ""where he lives"" (he's ""staying with a friend while he figures it out"") is actually the house of the girl he's been sneaking around with."
"I wouldn't be surprised if the coworkers ""pitched in"" for that private room."
She doesn't want all of the money and is happy sharing it with me but parents are trying to convince her to not feel guilty about it. I don't think this there's a chance that she'd be able to convince our parents. 
"I’m seeing it from the other point of view. 

Asking your adult child to not only work for you for free, but to forgo other paying clients to do so (ie he’s effectively PAYING MONEY to help them). How cheap do you have to be to not value his time and expertise enough to pay him? That’s really petty. His parents should be the first in line to pay their son for his professional services, especially knowing that the money will stay in the family, helping him support his own family. 

And BTW if they’ve had their house for 25 years, it’s highly likely they’ll be making a MASSIVE profit, and so would be able to easily afford to pay for his services. 

His parents are all wrong, IMHO. "
You don't have to be
You told him and it had no effect. Do you always want to have to be icy cold to him to get him to be something resembling a real boyfriend to you? To spend your life playing a game of who cares the least? Because once he gets comfortable again it's going to be business as usual with him. 
"I think they meant it the other way- every time you make a valid point, you undercut it by calling it petty, dumb, adolescent, etc. but I think your viewpoints are none of those things. Your feelings about this situation are valid, and make sense to me."
Why wouldn't you tell your husband? 
"I wonder if she’s bored of being a mommy, especially if her friends are off doing “fun, exciting” things while her life is as you say uneventful. A typical downfall of social media is it often shows only the most exciting best parts of a persons life, and can throw off one’s balance of normal. I would recommend couples counseling."
What is more concerning is that he refuses to talk about it and work through it with you. 
"I worked as an exotic dancer for a long time, so I'll happily give you the deal on what goes down in those rooms. In all honesty, the unzipping of his pants is not usually how it goes. I have never worked in a club where that is the norm and I've danced in many clubs all over the country. They either went to an especially seedy club where private room = hand/blowjob, or he/his friends offered to pay her extra money to break the rules. And even without that, I still think a private room is a form of cheating - boob and butt toucing is allowed, and in a club like this where she tried to take things further, he probably touched her vagina in all honesty.

I am sorry this happened to you. I would consider myself cheated on if this happened to me and would be reconsidering the relationship (actually, I'd probably just end it), especially because circumstances had to be very shady to get offered a hand/blowjob in such a setting. That is not normal in most clubs! He may have been honest about getting the private room, but he's not telling you the full truth IMO.  Yes he touched her boobs which he admitted, but was any other below the belt touching involved? Nipple sucking? In a club like that where extras can happen, who knows.

It's worth adding that his friends are garbage who clearly have no respect for you, which is also a red flag. They seem to think encouraging your man to cheat on you is hilarious. I've seen those types of guys in the club many times and ugh,they have no respect for women at all. I'm always shocked these men have women in their lives that they *don't* have to pay"

"Talk with your dad about all of this. What she did is super rude IMO. ""Hey dad, I felt really disrespected when [stepmom] did X, Y, and Z. While I understand that I'm not entitled to a new phone, I don't understand why she has to gloat about getting this phone to me, especially on my birthday. Can I talk about this with you?"""
"You seem like a good dude, so I'll just say: focus on your own belly hair. I mean it. Think about the fact that no one in the world bats an eyelash at it or expects you to remove it/for it magically not to be there. Hopefully with time it'll just set in that hers is as natural as yours.

It does sound like you may have intrusive thoughts, like the more you try not to focus on it, the more you focus on it. The best thing you can do in that case is to deal with it head-on until your brain relaxes and realizes it's no big deal."
"I just felt so small, like a castaway little mouse but still with everyone watching me. Idk it was horrible. I finally locked eyes with my bf across the room (who knows about the DDD stuff and my insecurities with my dad) and I've never seen him look at me with pity before but the way he looked at me just broke my heart even more. Like even he knew how much that would hurt me, what my dad said, and my dad didn't even think twice. "
"Your kid is being a kid, and needs her mother; your wife, with a history of mental illness, is displaying signs of it again. Your wife, daughter, and yourself need help, most likely in the form of helping your wife's mental state."
Pretty bad when the description makes me think of Harry Potter and Sirius Black with the family tree and scorch marks on the wall.
"This x100! I have a friend who is married to a guy like this. When her dad died (unexpectedly and without warning), she wasn't even allowed to bring it up in front of him because he ""was sick of her negativity"" and ""didn't want to be brought down"". He even cracked jokes at the funeral. That's how much he didn't give a shit about what was happening. 
She'd call me numerous times over the next few weeks, because she couldn't even talk to her scummy husband about her own father's death. :(

Don't end up like my friend, OP. Run for the hills."
"&gt; I think it’s fair to say that she has some demons that she hasn’t properly addressed and that she unfortunately took out on you.

You're not wrong, but this is still so far from okay it's insane. She needs to get into counseling yesterday if there is a shred of a chance of saving this. In this case, it was just kidney stones, but it could have been a matter of life and death. What about when they are older and health issues are more frequent and serious?  What if she caused a future child to miss medical care?

This is a massive, huge issue. This is not some little misunderstanding. This girl needs serious counseling. "
"You can tell your mother you don't want her there, but you can't stop her for coming or speaking at the funeral.

I'm sorry you are in this horrible position.  It isn't fair.  Another poster suggested setting up counseling services through your school and that is something you really need to do.

Do you have any other family you are close to?  Grandparents, cousins, aunts?  If you do try to reach out to them.  If your mom moves in her 'b/f' are any of them likely to take you in? 

I'm sorry, OP.  "
"I want to tell you that I think there is hope for your situation.

When I started dating my husband, his dog was about a year and a half old. I'm not really a dog person, but she was generally well behaved and he did all of the heavy lifting with her, so we all got along just fine.

When we moved in together and got married, the dog came too. He still did most of the heavy lifting, and I mostly only picked up the slack when me and the dog where home alone. We weren't really friends, but very cordial acquaintances.

I am a runner, and one day I decided that the dog might like to run with me (mostly because I was tired of playing fetch with her!). Something about that experience completely turned our relationship around. I trained her on leash manners, bought a running harness for her and a waist leash for me, and taught her ""left"" and ""right"" so I could tell her which way we were turning at an intersection. Having this independent interaction with the dog allowed us to build our own relationship. She listened to ME, learned from ME, and enjoyed one of my favorite hobbies with ME.

Fast forward a couple of years, and now I cry when we drop her off at the dog-sitters for the weekend, I'm the first to suggest a vet visit when she's acting sick, and her face is the screensaver on my computer.

I think it was HUGELY helpful that my husband didn't force the dog on me when I wasn't up for it. I also think having the dog ""help me"" enjoy one of my hobbies was a big relationship-builder. So, I think you're doing the right thing in doing most of the dog chores. I also think if you tone down your affection for the dog and refocus most of your attention on your boyfriend when he's around that would help him feel less threatened/replaced by the dog. Finally, see if there is anything your bf likes that your dog could help him enjoy. If he sees himself getting real enjoyment from the dog (outside of just enjoying the dog's company) that might help him invest more in the relationship.

"Side not before I get into the advice, letting the homeless people into the hall while a nice idea is completely irresponsible especially with you not staying with them while they are in the hall. Unfortunately a sizeable portion of the homeless population is mentally unstable and that could have ended really badly. 

Otherwise this may just be an incompatibility neither of you are wrong its just differences in personality. He is allowed to feel uncomfortable and you are allowed to do what you think is right. If you are interested in staying the relationship though I don't think you would be being a good partner by continuing to do things with him that you know make him uncomfortable. So you should definitely think about that, also if this is going to be long term how you want to raise your kids. Because that will be a huge fight."

He needs a therapist. 
"Not helpful, Solomon!"
"&gt;HIS mentally unstable mother will not be a help or comfort to her.

OP will be struggling to not end up with PPD and will have her MIL there telling her everything she's doing is wrong and will probably push OP into PPD. This is such a bad idea for soooo many reasons!! "
"The fact that he told you while you were having sex is so gross - he tried to incorporate this into your sex life, getting off on humiliating you or his big confession or something. It's disgusting."
"You're not unreasonable. This is silly. What's his plan here - he and his ex continue to own a house together for the rest of their lives? 

His options are that either he or the ex buy the house from the other, or they sell the house and share the money according to how much each put in. I don't see how anything else makes any sense. 

And yes it's a bit much to expect that you hide your relationship, to spare his ex's feelings. She's an ex! Her feelings shouldn't factor into your relationship. 

The person being selfish here is your boyfriend: he doesn't want to give up the house, he doesn't want to deal with figuring out what to do with the house, and he doesn't want to deal with maybe upsetting his ex, so he avoids it all at your expense. "
"&gt; That her and my brother always wished that my parents had stopped after her

Wait, **what**? That's an absurdly self-absorbed thing to say. You haven't mentioned your brother at all yet, nor have you talked about your sister's character or your relationship with her, but honestly at this point I'm kind of putting some fault on them for not confronting your father about his favoritism issues."
Absolutely. It should have started ten years ago. 
"Definitely this! Now would be the perfect time to send out a message to all the mutual friends explaining that you caught ex-bf cheating and when you called him out on it he just blocked you and  walked out...leaving all his stuff and his poor dog behind. That you would appreciate any of them stopping by to pick up the dog (and the dog's food and belongings, at least)and bring it to wherever he moved to. No drama, no name-calling....just the simple facts and that you would be grateful for some assistance in this awkward situation.

He has definitely gotten ahead of this and told his version of the breakup, undoubtedly casting OP as the ""crazy"" ex-girlfriend holding  his shit hostage. So, if OP appears to be calm and very open to having all of his possessions delivered to him, it'll go a long way towards OP preserving those mutual friendships and getting their support.

A lawyer can draw up an agreement regarding the split of any jointly owned assets and will handle the delivery and negotiations, including a statement that the ex needs to only contact her through the lawyer. OP needs to accept the breakup, put aside any anger and start to cover her own ass asap.

Edit: I was just thinking, OP might want to invite a couple of those mutual friends over tonight, before she touches any of his stuff, explain that he's doing a bit of gaslighting and acting hostile and that she would appreciate them taking pictures of every room so there is unbiased proof that OP hasn't damaged any of his belongings. Then maybe have *them* box up his stuff and bring it to him. OP's ex is making this a hostile breakup...OP really needs to consult a lawyer, like yesterday."
"To your last line, quote Twisted Sister:

""If that's your best, your best won't do.”"
"I think his message could mean damn near anything. His GF could be straight up abusive and trying to isolate him. Or she could just be more jealous than the average person. OR he has had feelings for you and never told you and the GF feels like that's a boundary for her.

I think you should advise your friend to watch out for signs that he's pulling away from his other friends as well. Pulling away from one friend is a personal choice; pulling away from all your friends is a sign that something is very wrong."
Wow. Tough. I’m really sorry. I’m sure you will learn to trust again and find someone much better than her. Best of luck ❤️
"What's happening here is also called the ""Missing Stair Theory"" -- someone is clearly abusive, but the community keeps working around that person instead of dealing with them. You have a good handle on that fact that people are behaving outrageously and putting blame on you instead of on the person who lost his shit. Definitely -- counseling with your husband. He has to understand his part on this dynamic, and that you are not out of line to be outraged."
"Why would you even ask your coworker if you’re just friends? To clarify what exactly? If I were your coworker and I genuinely did not have feelings for you, I’d be so weirded out by that question. It’s obvious you have some kind of feelings for this coworker, so cut off any non work related contact if you care about your marriage at all. I find it hard to believe you’re this naive or ignorant. You sound pretty damn manipulative, to be frank."
"So, score-keeping in a relationship sucks, true. But in this case, I think you need to sit down and literally *keep score*. If one partner works 10 more hours, okay, it's reasonable the other would do more things around the house. But they still have to be fair. Most people do a deep clean of the bathroom once a week, where cooking is a nightly chore, so those hours have to be all added up. I doubt that he realizes how many hours your cleaning takes, since it sounds like he hasn't had to do it in a long time. Tell him you want to split cooking because it's something you enjoy. You can certainly make it more even all-around. 

But these: 

- Cleaning HIS dogs' cages? Stop that right now. His dogs, his chore. 

- He ""helps"" you wash HIS car?? Never again. His car, his chore. You don't make him clip your toenails, right? Because they are YOUR toenails. 

And tell him cleaning isn't his ""weakness"". (My eyes are rolling down the street.) Some people find cleaning relaxing or feel anxious if they don't clean. For the rest of us, it sucks and is necessary. What would he do if he lived alone? Drive a dirty car with filthy dogs back to his filthy house because he's so ""weak""? "
"&gt;We have currently been doing the distance for 3 months since then

Dude, WHAT??? He lied to you, left without telling you, and you're still hanging on???

Honestly, a long-distance relationship can't work without good, effective, strong communication between the parties and he STARTED IT OFF by hiding it from you. that's a TERRIBLE sign. 

Are you getting what you need from this guy, emotionally? Is the distance thing working for you NOW? 

Dang, I don't think I'd be able to come back around from the kind of betrayal and weak cop-out this guy pulled. OUCH."
"Okay. I know what you're feeling. And I'm going to tell you what helped me.

Feel **compassion.** Not empathy.

Don't think, ""My mum is going to feel so sad when all her kids turn her back on her. It's going to be SO painful for her to be rejected by all her children when she loves us! She'll be alone with her demons, and she'll crumble! I can't bear to think of how sad she'll feel!"" That's empathy. There's no point in feeling her feelings on her behalf, because it doesn't make her feel better, and it will make you feel A LOT worse.

What you need to think instead is *compassion*. ""My mother has done a lot of things that have pushed all her children away. She had a really rough childhood and that made her make a lot of unhealthy choices, including choices that have had impacts I'm sure she didn't intend. She is an adult and she is going to have to manage the consequences of her actions on her own, and with her new partner. I wish her all the best, but it's going to benefit me to take some space from her for the time being.""

You can care about your mother and love her...from a distance. You can understand the reasons why she made her choices, without excusing her for them, or taking the weight of those decisions onto yourself.  


EDIT: Thank you for the Gold! I'm very glad this concept has helped a lot of people! "
Sounds more like a cool trip with friends to me than a birthday. 
"It is a for sure thing, but even after he has money, I can't see him actually being thoughtful with it. I don't want to be spoiled, I just want to be prioritized."
"I’m sorry man.

Untreated mental illness is devastating to a relationship. Do not let yourself fall into the “I could have / can do more” camp. It is not your burden to carry.

Let your daughter still be a kid. Tell her you two are working things out, and life is complicated. Don’t tell her why her mom left, don’t lean on her for emotional support. Reassure her, find something new to do together. Get yourself into therapy and get her into therapy. There are sure to be some resounding issues that came along with your exes illness. Kids are especially sensitive to this stuff.

Don’t beg anymore. It isn’t going to help. Respect her words and her decision. You’ll be walking blindfolded for a while, but you’ll be ok. Find a licensed therapist to speak with. Right now you are standing in the center of a scale. Putting too much weight before or behind you will only make things harder. Emotions are high, so count backward from ten. If you lose your place, begin again from ten.

I had a mental breakdown a few years ago, I broke up the relationship because I was totally overwhelmed. Some people can’t help others understand what they need.

No matter what happens, you will find your place. You’ll be ok. "

"And that's the manipulative game that emotional abusers like to play.

"I just got out of a relationship with someone raised by a narcissistic drama queen of a mother. I've come quite close to saying something similar to her as your husband did to your mother, but never crossed that line. But damn, **your** reaction to this would frustrate me to no end. You can't control your mother, but you can absolutely control how much of a presence she has in your life. And it sounds like you're doing a lousy job of it.

Was what your husband said out of line? Yes. And you should point that out to him. But you KNOW an apology won't fix anything, because your husband isn't the real problem here. Your mother is. How are you addressing that? Are you likewise demanding an apology from your mother to your husband, for, among other things:

1. Kicking him out of his own room?
2. Ruining the vacation for both of you?
3. Calling him violent and demanding you divorce him?

I'm going to take a wild guess and say you aren't... likely because you were raised by a toxic person and learned to cope by enabling her behavior and giving her attention. You can easily see when one thing your husband said was out of line, but you're refusing to view your mother the same way or judge her accordingly. You might think you're keeping the peace, or that you can somehow make things right between them all, but you can't. All you're doing is playing into your mother's hands, and I 100% guarantee your marriage will suffer for it. Stop asking him to give an apology and start putting some clear boundaries between you and your mother."
"That's hilariously sad. Well, now you know to never depend on him to pay his fair share. You can't control who your coworker is friends with, but you can limit your interaction with John when he's around.

You didn't say this, but judging from your title, it seems like you're bothered by the content of his comment and how it reflects upon you/your sex life. I just wanted to throw out there that having sex with a lot of people is not an accomplishment, and it's sad that he thinks that makes him better in any way."
"EMT here with some specific perspective.

People who work in emergency services tend to have a very similar outward facing personality: dark humor as a coping mechanism, strong sense of camaraderie, and an aversion to expressing emotions. Your boyfriend sounds exactly like one of us. I’ll bet that he has a rich, but very internal, emotional life that he hardly ever shares with anyone - just like the rest of us. 

When something gets under your skin, as an emergency provider, it’s hardly ever the blood/guts/gore. It’s usually the interpersonal things we see on the job - the demented old folks being neglected by shitty nursing homes, the children being raised by drug addicted parents because CPS said the home was OK for the fifth time, etc. Sometimes it’s when we find ourselves in danger, and realize how fragile life is. My point is, we tend to keep these things amongst ourselves - we make dark jokes, we talk about how sad or horrible cases are with each other, and then we drop it before we come home. 

The fact that he called you, means that he has respect, confidence, and trust in you. It means he knows that your kind, empathetic soul will understand what he’s going through. It means he sees you as someone he can depend on. 

My advice is: Have his favorite beer and a snack  waiting at home for when he’s off work. If you won’t be around or awake when he does, leave a small note with it - just a short “hey I love you” thing, no specific mentions of his work day. Let him bring it up if he wants to. If he does, reassure him that his emotions are valid and it’s good to express them. If you cry too, because of your empathy, reassure him that you’re just feeling the power of his emotions and not upset that he’s sharing. 

I’ve seen a lot of providers torpedo their relationships because of their unwillingness to share when the going gets tough. The fact that he reaches out to you is a very positive sign, that you guys have a strong and healthy relationship. Kudos to you."
"I mean i thought everyone knew siblings and friends are just not okay to jerk it to. That’s just disrespectful. He coulda found some anon model with similar or better pictures and not someone he personally knew, and your sister at that. Even if you’re swingers, you wouldn’t be swingin with her I would assume. "
I can't see her as being that remorseful if she is already demanding an apology. I don't think she is on that position to be making those kinds of requests.
Hoo boy. I think this is way more common than people know. I think you nailed it.

"Wow, I didn't even think about this. In every other aspect of his life, he is the least anxious person I know. He takes on leadership roles in his professional life with ease, and even in stressful situations is extremely calm. I didn't identify him as a person with anxiety issues, because in 99% of situations, he isn't anxious. But when you put it into perspective it made me realize exactly how much anxiety he must be experiencing over this one particular issue. And how hard it was for him to even take these 'baby steps'. It's hard to even get him to talk about this issue because he basically shuts down. I believe you're right about a therapist. Bringing in a professional would be the best way to go about this, I have absolutely no idea how to handle deep-rooted trauma and I don't believe he can do it on his own. "
"Show up as Harry potters actual gf/wife, Ginny! 

It’s definitely a bit odd to me, since this girl has caused problems before and friends are talking to you about the “couples” costume. I think you need to be straight and tell him people are telling you and you are uncomfortable "
Having seen it a couple times with queer friends it didn't work. The dynamics of attractrion were too different. One did try to stay together for a couple years and she was miserable and wished she had pulled the plug earlier. 
"IMHO, you did the right thing. You reacted with your best interests at heart as he clearly doesn't care. He made it clear that you aren't relationship material for *him* yet you had clearly stated that you are looking for a relationship. I feel bad for the girl he *does* want!

So no, you did good. You don't need that kind of bullshit in your life. He has no respect for you, whereas I do!! 😎 Standing up for yourself like that?? Go you!"
"&gt; I think what he did is forgivable, especially considering the way he’s handled it. I just don’t know if I’m saying that this behavior is acceptable if I stay with him. Does staying with him mean I have no dignity or self-worth? On the other hand, would I regret ending an otherwise great relationship and giving up my future husband over this?

You're not communicating that it's acceptable, but you are communicating that it's potentially forgivable.

It doesn't mean you're without dignity or self-worth. It means that a betrayal doesn't automatically shut off feelings and you're still working through how you feel about it. You're not robbed of your dignity because you can forgive a betrayal, but it's also okay if you decide down the road that you can't.

I'm going to part ways with my fellow Redditors now. I'm concerned about your fiance's behavior and character.

First, he agreed to go into a private room with a stripper. Second, he didn't just receive a lap dance - he touched her boobs. I can't speak for everyone, but I don't care if my boyfriend is touching the boobs of a paid entertainer or an unpaid volunteer. I consider sexual touching without my permission cheating. Third, he concealed what happened instead of immediately confessing. Fourth, although seemingly he's taking responsibility, he's also blaming his friends for pressuring him. That bothers me and I don't think it's entirely honest. Being real here, he didn't go into a private room and touch boobies as a reluctant victim of peer pressure. He wanted to do that. Fifth, and finally, you're right that you can't know all that happened, but you have some reason to doubt his version.

I sincerely hope he's being 100% honest *now* and that you don't get a trickle-truthing in the coming weeks. ""Okay, she touched my penis, but then I definitely stopped her."" ""Okay, she put her mouth on it, but I stopped it."" ""She blew me, but we didn't have sex."" I imagine that you two are going to have some conversations in which more information might come out and you have to prepare for that, as well as decide how you want to handle it.

I'm not going to tell you to break up, but I am going to tell you to guard your heart. Be open  to the possibility that this breach of trust isn't surmountable even if it is forgivable. By all means, work on it in counseling or whatever you need to do. You won't know how you feel until you go through the process. What I am advising against is deciding right now that you must forgive him and stay because you're engaged and you've picked him as your life partner. It puts too much internal pressure to make it work even if it's no longer workable."
"Maybe it’s a MLM orgy. “Each person gets blown by two people, and they get blown by two people...”"
"1. He already cheated on you.
2. You almost caught him when he told you about those dating apps on his phone.
3. He’s not going to confess until you change your answer to the questions he’s asking, which means his conscience is dependent on whether he can expect to be forgiven. 

Break up with him. You don’t believe in cheating and he’s trying to skirt your belief system. He’s abusing your trust."
"I am from Brazil and this is NOT a culture shock. While it's true this kind of behavior is more common here, it is totally not common for partners to be doing that with one another. And even if it were common, it doesn't mean its ""the culture"" or ""its ok"".

Seriously, she sounds like a very bad person, and will always keep doing this kind of thing, as long as you let her.

If she is giving you the silent treatment when you express an issue you have and expose a bad behavior in her, then you should definitely stand your ground, and say something along the lines of ""you are being very childish"", or ""if you do this again, I won't be able to handle the pain or this relationship"", then drop the conversation and do something else. She may leave you, or she may finally see her actions and change, but that is the only way of self respect.

"Yeah, OP needs to tell her brother that just because *he's* low enough to not want to date someone with a past like hers, doesn't mean everyone is that callow."

(Though all the clubs I've worked at have had zero-tolerance extras policies so I'm actually shocked that she tried it!)"
I would be willing to bet that you do this more often than you think you do and that's why he's so sick of it. You owe him full honesty and a big apology for your behaviour. 
"And then there’s the added fear on her part that he’ll do better long enough to convince her to stay, and then he’ll just go back to his old behavior. Especially if, as you pointed out, he’s changing out of fear of being alone as opposed to changing because he truly loves her. "

"You're totally right. I just meant that, I'd mentioned once to my bf about the DDDs and how much that hurt me, and even just from that one conversation he knew how much my dad's speech would kill me.
Yet, my dad never once considered it? Like, how could he write that speech (honestly the whole daddy-daughter dance thing was the theme throughout the whole speech, not just one line about it) and not once think to himself, hmmm, weird that I only did this for one daughter, huh? Like, he knew how upset I was my senior year, he was there, he knew how much it hurt me, and yet my bf who heard the story once years ago still thought more about my feelings than my own father. "
"At this point, you’d honestly be better off without him, his debt, and his habit of making major life decisions without consulting you.  He’s not respecting you.  In fact, he seems to be using you to raise his kids and placate his ex.  What are you getting out of this deal? "

"This is a tough one because like you said happiness and learning to love oneself comes from within, but there are some ways you can help! 

First of all, regarding your boyfriend, I think he needs some therapy or at least a method of venting his frustrations because there seems to be more going on there than just the weight issue.

Second, you sound amazing and you really are doing a great job by telling him you love the way he looks and you shouldn't stop doing that because you think it makes him feel worse. Right now, he is hearing from his girlfriend whom he most likely feels is very attractive, that he is attractive himself. If you were to stop telling him that, then he wouldn't be hearing it from anyone and his destructive thoughts would tear himself down even more because he's not hearing any positive comments regarding his body.

As for what you yourself can do for him, I think that if you express to him that you are genuinely attracted to bigger men that will make him feel more comfortable around you.

I am a male in pretty good shape and I don't have a belly, but I still get self conscious around my partner because I used to be fat and once that mentality is there, it's pretty hard to get rid of. All you can do it become more comfortable with the one that you love / share your life with. He needs to be reassured that you love him for himself, not just hit body. Also, by explicitly stating how you like bigger men, you could explain what about him in particular that you like. Tell him how you like his love handles, tell him that you like that he's a bit chunky. Although he may react not 100% positively, you are putting positive thoughts in his mind and telling him that you accept him how he is. 

One thing you could do is try to empathize and speak about your insecurities as well to show him that you also struggle with self image. It's just a way to acquire common ground and show your partner that you are not perfect. 

Lots of text, hopefully a bit of this helps and I didn't just ramble about nothing. "

"&gt; how do I help him overcome his insecurities and show him he can have good things too if he doesn’t destroy them all?

Ok, I have to agree with all the other posters here. He's seriously disturbed, and you need to end it with him.

However, I have something to add. His behavior was profoundly disturbing, but it's equally alarming that you respond to it (in a brand new relationship, nonetheless) by thinking, ""Ok, how do *we* fix this?"" That's not a normal or healthy reaction. There's something rattling around inside you that's preventing you from 1) recognizing a clear, relationship-ending, boundary violation and 2) acting accordingly to defend your safety and happiness.

You're going to have to face your own mental health issues if you want higher quality relationships in the future. The root cause might be self-esteem; it might be fear of abandonment issues; perhaps prior desensitization to abuse; etc. If you honestly don't know where to start, therapists are a great resource for providing a fresh perspective. Even a couple of sessions might be enough to point out a blind spot in your mental health that you can follow up on independently. Best of luck!"

"&gt;and tell her all this, without breaking her heart.

You can't manage her emotions.  I think there is a high chance that no matter how diplomatic you are, your mother will still be upset.  

I'd just use work as an excuse as to why you won't be traveling or entertaining guests.  

Rather than just flat out telling her that you don't want a closer relationship, just let the status quo continue.  Just because she wants something doesn't mean you have to indulge it.  

"
She begged you for years? Live with your consequences. Its over.
"Girl. Why. 

*Why* are you trying to drag this fight out? Why did you want to “work it out” with someone who made it crystal clear that he’s not into you? Stop trying to contact him and start protecting yourself. Call attorneys about splitting your shared assets and make sure he can’t drain any shares bank accounts. You don’t need to wait for him to reply to you to start doing this. Do it today and do it fast. This relationship is toast and further contact will only make you feel nuts. He’s done enough, stop going back for more. "
"Not the op but may be able to shed some light on this. Emotions don’t make sense. My Dad left when I was 2. He met someone else and went on to have 2 more kids with her. I didn’t see my dad all that often and when I did he was very loving and affectionate but the older I got the more apparent it was that he preferred them to us. They got everything and my mum had to beg for help getting me glasses. I spent my whole life getting let down by him but for some reason I never stopped hoping he would suddenly be the dad I needed him to be, even when I was obviously old enough to know better. I was 30 when he died and I felt let down all over again. Like he abandoned me one more time. The relationship with parents like that is so complex because we constantly yearn to be enough and to be wanted more. 
TLDR: emotions suck and it’s hard to just cut off a parent whom you love. "
"It looks a lot like there's two possible explanations for her behavior: either she doesn't believe in your relationship enough to think it's worth advertising, or she wants to keep her options open. Both options are awful. 

If it matters to you, you should sit down with her and find out which it is exactly and why. If it doesn't matter to you either way (because let's face it, both options are shit and amount to the same thing - that she doesn't view your relationship as long term) then cut your losses and run for it mate. "
"The other posters have done a good job.

I can only add that this is a reflection of your mum, not you. She might have been an okay parent, but she wasn't the parent you needed, and she wasn't a fair one to you and your sister. 

Your sister might not get it. She probably won't. And that's fine - you get to choose how much work you want to put into that relationship. 

You don't know where you will be in 10 years.

You can only move forwards.

"If he's lacking on basic education, maybe encourage him to attend GED classes. It's hard to form basic opinions on the world if you have no clue about it.

"I was wondering if this was weird for anyone else, why the hell is he going through your stuff? He has absolutely no right to feel 'betrayed', you haven't known him long enough to feel the need to share all the private details of your health.

You should tell him he's betrayed your trust by snooping through your things when your trusted him in your home. If he can't accept your use of medical marijuana, then he'll have to move on and find someone who doesn't use it, and won't mind that he'll be going through her things when she's not home."
"This baby is a PERSON, I can’t believe their dad is treating them like a therapy dog or something. 

Your mother in law, as well as your husband are two horribly selfish people. She doesn’t care that you’re going to go through one of the most stressful and difficult, and precious and beautiful and incredibly demanding periods of your life, she just wants her wishes to be granted. And your husband is ok with all of it, as long as he doesn’t have to stand up to mom. 

You have to put your foot down and do what’s best for baby and you."

"Don’t make a big deal out of it with your words. If you get ambushed like that, just walk out. You don’t even have to say anything. Establish yourself as the shots-caller. Show them you’re serious by always being prepared to leave at a moment’s notice, and then doing so when the moment calls for it. Pretending they didn’t know he was going is them manipulating you."
"I think it's ""forgive and forget"" if it's a spouse.  If you're dating, part of what you're looking for is red flags for, ""You should not marry this person.""  Evidence of the same problems being persistent instead of one-offs would be a valid reason to end a relationship."
I kinda feel like maybe real-life antisemitism is actually worse than your example...
"First off, the whole post is about your wants and needs; you're husband's invisible: you tell us more about what your mother thinks than what he thinks. 

&gt; . I've suggested it a few times and he's either avoided the subject or out-right said no.

You made demands of your husband that damaged your marriage. And your approach to fixing it is to demand more of your husband. You might want to go look up Einstein's definition of insanity.

Why don't you turn things around: ask your husband how HE feels, what hurts he's nursing from these experiences, and what HE wants from you and from the marriage. Take the time to read up on active listening first, don't interrupt or try to explain your actions, just let him get it all out.

Counseling is a framework in which the partners listen to each other in a structured environment. Unless you can listen, counseling isn't going to get you very far."

I don’t really know what to say to you except I’m sorry. The counseling might help but unlessnyour husband is willing to stick up for you it’s not really going to change anything. And while this might not be a divorce worthy event to you or him or anyone else it certainly shows that your husband lacks character.

"After reading the title I was ready to answer “helllll no you’re not bad, that’s a lot of cash.” But after reading, it sounds like she wanted to plan something big, fun and different for everyone. And it sounds like more of a group event to maybe celebrate y’all friends going into your 30’s? And this timeframe worked for everyone to gather?

Unless I’m misunderstanding a lot, I do think this is more of a fun “going big” hurrah your friend wanted for everyone. That said, if you don’t want to spend the money, you’re not obligated to. That is a hefty chunk of change for most people, and I think most would be understanding if you didn’t want to have to shell out that much cash. 

I wouldn’t depend on being able to change their plans, though. You’re right in that I’m sure she could’ve done something cheaper, but I don’t think that was her goal here - she wanted to do something big and different. Unless this is something she does all the time, and given that you say you can afford it, I don’t think it would be a terrible idea to just attend and have fun."

"Minister here. 

Your daughter is not possessed.  She's *imaginative*.  That's it.  She has a relatively common idea about anthropomorphizing her toys, and is taking it to more of an extreme than many kids, but she's not possessed.

Your wife needs help to overcome her fears, and baptizing your daughter is not the way to do that, because the baptism will not affect the child's behavior in any way, so hanging your wife's hopes on that will lead to a bigger crisis later, when ""the devil is still in her even though we baptized her"".

Whether you baptize your daughter is, of course, up to you.  I, personally, believe that such a covenant should be made of free will, so the daughter should have a choice about whether or not to be. But that is neither here nor there for the current situation: baptism out of fear is, as you say, the wrong reason. "
"I have friendships with several trans people, but not romantic relationships. However, we have talked about relationships a lot. I understand wanting to tell your crush that you know he's trans and you accept him. Telling someone that you figured out that they are trans on your own and accept them *feels* like it's the right thing to do, like you would relieve them of the burden of a secret. It definitely is not. Don't do it. Not only does it make them feel like their privacy has been violated, it can make them feel like they don't pass or like their transition is a dirty secret they were hiding, when it was actually just a part of themselves they hadn't shared yet. Just wait until he is ready. Continue to behave as you have been. Asking if he is open to dating in general is the boldest move you should make. Eventually, he will tell you when he is ready."

"&gt; I have spoken to her about this and she says she likes getting drunk, what's the point of drinking if you're only going to have a few, and she is not going to stop.

Word-for-word what my alcoholic ex said when confronted about his drinking. It was all-or-nothing, wasted-or-sober for him. A glass or two of wine with dinner was less appealing than no booze at all. He HAD to get stumbling drunk or it was no fun for him. 

Took me three years to accept that it wasn’t going to change and that I couldn’t deal with it and still be happy. He just wasn’t interested in getting his shit together (until I was walking out the door and you can guess how much *those* promises were worth). If you insist on trying to fix your girlfriend, you’re gonna have to accept that “cutting back” is not an option - she has to stop consuming alcohol entirely. One or two drinks will always always ALWAYS lead to more, and if she’s anything like my ex, limiting the alcohol that’s in the house will not stop her from going out and buying more once she’s started. There has to be zero. 

I’m sorry OP. It sucks. PM me if you want to talk. I’ve been there. "

"I was so hesitant to click on the link and read your words.     You see, I recently left a decade+ relationship I'd had with a narcissist.  Your words and your emotions sound so horribly familiar.  I wish I could give you a hug.  

My ex was obsessed with having everything about our lives and family appear to be perfect from the outside, but didn't care what things were actually like. As long as people thought he was the perfect father, and he got photo ops with the kids to be able to ""prove"" it, he didn't care about actually spending time with them.  As long as I acted like a happy, easygoing, submissive wife, he didn't care how lonely and desperately unhappy I was. 

I stayed for years, hoping things would get better, that I'd finally do everything just right, and he'd finally be kind and unselfish.  Surprise, it didn't happen.   It got worse as he grew older.    I've been spending the last two years trying to find myself, repair my self-confidence after it was torn to shreds, and unlearn really unhealthy behaviors.  After constantly being put down for so long, my inner monologue is very critical, and doesn't think I'm worth anything, or can do anything right, and doubts the validity of any of my emotions or thoughts.  I'm making progress, tiny steps, but it's really fucking difficult some days.  

I am so sorry.  But if he has NPD, things aren't going to get better as long as you're with him. You are worth so much more than this. 

But outside of this, a fresh, new world awaits you.  Where you can breathe easily and have a peaceful home, you can follow your own pursuits, and build a community of people who build you up, who enjoy spending time around you, who love you and your kids.  People who don't expect you to be perfect, but want to be with you all the same.  People who are kind and encouraging.  I *know* this is out there for you, because it was for me, and I'm grateful for it every single day.  

Please know my inbox is open, and if you ever need to vent, I'm here to listen.  Sending love your way. &lt;3 "

"&gt;Does keeping this secret (breaking the ""no lies"" rule) make me a bad girlfriend?

oh my gosh NO, don't spoil the surprise! "
"I thought the exact same thing!

My advice to him is the same as my interpretation of what went on to his wife:

OP, dude, come ON.

You are deliberately lying and hiding this and picking another women OVER your wife, your team mate, your best friend.  Not in a subconscious way, but in an entirely conscious, deliberate, ""well, if she never finds out, it won't hurt her..."" sort of way that even cheaters and people who secretly sign their spouse's name on a secret joint card do.

That kind of thinking is so selfish that it hurts.  It damages a relationship to it's absolute bedrock as relationships are nothing without trust.  You might as well have chiseled a crack in the foundation of the respect you allegedly have for your wife, wedged a stick of dynamite in there, and then looked shocked when it went off and suddenly rubble was everywhere.

Your wife possibly won't ever trust you again.  This is a woman that's ""just"" a friend, but you're picking her repeatedly OVER your wife.  Your wife's requests were utterly sane and reasonable, yet you couldn't even bear to follow them properly.

Why was this the mole hill you were so willing to sacrifice the foundation of your marriage on?

Are you unhappy with your marriage?  Do you need intimacy?  Are you lonely?  Do you need to feel validated? Are you bored?

The first four things you should turn to your wife for.  That's what a deep, loving relationship with your spouse is for.  And if you're bored with life or work or whatever, then you need to shake it up but bring your wife along as your partner and team mate.  Go sky diving together or scuba diving or something.  Date each other.  

Or, if you need some space, have a guy/girl's nights where you two go hang out, separately, with your friend groups.  At the end of the night, meet up and chat about your night apart.  It's fun to hear about the adventures your spouse had and it's refreshing to hear about things you weren't there to witness sometimes.

(Sidenote: do not, and I mean SERIOUSLY DO NOT, bring that coworker to your friend group.  Consider that bridge burned by your own untrustworthiness forever.  For right now, just go out with guys until your wife begins to trust you to put both of your priorities first instead of just your own).

Your wife will probably make demands for you to regain her trust.  You need to do all of them.  Show her she is your priority, always, because after that shit you pulled, she probably feels like she's been utterly disrespected, ignored, and like you've been utterly selfish at the expense of her feelings. 

She wants counseling?  You fucking go to counseling.  Make the appointment yourself.  Show her you want this as much as she does.

She wants you to not speak to the woman again?  Block her on anything not company owned (personal ways to get in contact with you).  If your friend asks about it at work, just say, ""I'm taking a huge step back from our friendship right now to work on my marriage.  I'd appreciate if you gave me a lot of space.""

A good friend will respect that. A shitty one will keep pushing the issue.

Finally, you need to show your wife you can set up healthy boundaries from now on.  Yeah, you might not have had a physical affair, but you either did or came damn close to an emotional one.  You need to show your wife that you want primary intimacy with her, that you will spend more emotional energy on her.

When things get back to normal, you'll know and she'll tell you, but for right now, you need to take responsibility for the consequences of your lying and deliberate hiding. "
Tell her family that's why she takes it in the ass. 
"Don't add any disclaimers.  Just laugh it off and say something like ""sorry about last night, you were much taller than usual and things weren't where they normally are lol""."
"How can you fix it?

You did nothing wrong - he did!

Look at how you present this entire post, for one you're insisting he's a nice guy to try to minimize his abusive behavior to us but also your questions focus on this idea that you've something wrong - you haven't.

Your boyfriend is showing red flags for abusive behavior: controlling, destroyed your things, belittling interests, demanding more attention. Him being nice to you doesn't erase his bad behavior, this is who he is too.

You pursue whatever interests you want, he doesn't get to tell you what's worth while and time with him shouldn't take priority over time on your interests, you don't need to change your approach with him because this is his problem to deal with. Continue to pursue your interests, don't allow him to tell you that you can't or make you feel you shouldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;told me I was very mature for my age (which made me feel pretty good)

This is how creeps get teen girls to date them, the correct response should have been not to pursue you - you think you're the one teen who's actually as mature as they think, and he's an exception to every other adult man dating teen girls, but that denial is a problem. Add that he's providing you with HRT, which may be nice but it's also making you dependent on him, and now he's trying to control you...you need to take a good hard look at your relationship dynamics.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
It's insane to me how OP goes on and on about how careful she is about finances and how hard she tries to make sure that she doesn't end up like her parents - and yet she tied herself to someone JUST AS BAD with money as her parents and keeps throwing her own livelihood down the tubes at him. 
"Ew, just dump this turd already. He put on a good show of niceness at the start, but now he’s gotten comfortable and he’s revealing his true awful self. 

Don’t date people who tear you down. Date people who build you up and want you to be your best self."
"All of this sounds like it's written by the guy in question, not his mom.

Also, 
&gt;I know if someone would just give him a career or if a girl would give him a chance he would prove himself so quickly and it would give him a sense of hope and happiness.

This all sounds so weird and transactional. Girls aren't objects to be acquired just so that he can feel better."
"If she doesn't trust you that you weren't checking out this other girl, then honestly, move on. This girl seems insecure as hell and needs to heal more from her past relationship.

Dude, this girl isn't worth it. She isn't ready to be in any sort of adult relationship right now and you're better off moving on. Don't force a relationship with someone who doesn't trust you. The grief isn't worth it for either of you."
"First thing you have to do is stop downplaying his flaws and how bad the situation is. ""Other than that, our relationship is great!"" = ""Other than some cat shit in my ice-cream, it's great!""
An hour a day? Promising dates for 2 years? Not even kissing you? Girl... Just divorce him and stay friends because that's what you are to him, and he's a shitty one to you at best! "
"The only apology she deserves from him is ""sorry that in my inebriated state of confusion from a severe medical emergency, my elevated frustration from YOUR dismissal of my medical wellbeing, and exhaustion from being run through a gamete of tests and procedures to fix the issues I had mentioned before YOUR dismissal of my health, I cussed at you."" 

If she can't admit that she has wronged you, that she has made a poor connection based on her own messed up parents (to your health), and that she can learn to be less dismissive and disrespectful  of your health concerns, drop her. "
"So your husband openly badmouths you to your children - which will have a *direct* impact on your relationship - but then forces you to cut off a friendship because you spoke about a word choice disagreement.

Your husband is trying to isolate you. Your relationship with him as described is unnatural. Honestly I thought this post was going to be about a man, and when not about a man, I thought you’d developed an attraction to your female friend.

The fact that it is neither of these and that you were forced to call off a long distance friendship suggests that your husband is controlling, isolating, for the purposes of abuse. 

I’m sure he’ll tell you this Reddit post is out of line too and next you won’t be allowed to use reddit 🙄"

"&gt;I reckon my takeaway should be that, though she puts on a strong front, she is struggling intensely inside and she needs her friends right now.

Beautifully said."
"Yup. He's trying to get with the girl and wants OP as a fall back. I would cut him out of my life and tell everyone he cheated so fast, his head would spin. He would not know what hit him."
"Your husband can't say no to his mother now, when she lives across the country. Good luck with this when she's posted up in your home and sobbing about being separated from ""her grandbaby.""

You're trying to be the cool reasonable wife. It is not going to work. It's going to hurt you and your child and your marriage. Your husband is not just any old pushover. He's perfectly capable of standing up to you, stepping all over *your* boundaries, and making you angry/hurt/sad as long as it makes his mother happy.

I really want you to recognize the fact that your husband is totally fine making you so uncomfortable and trapped in your own home immediately after giving birth to your first child to placate his mom. Honestly, it doesn't even matter if you're totally wrong and he's totally right and you *would* be grateful for all the wonderful help she ultimately provides in his fantasy world, because you have every right to say no to this kind of invasion of your space during what many consider a deeply private time. You wanting your sister there is not 'unfair' to his mother--that is an utterly ridiculous attempt at mental gymnastics to leverage getting his way.

Right now, he should be in protective papa bear mode and instead he's treating you like an unreasonable nag for wanting simple fucking boundaries immediately after giving birth. You seriously need to put your foot down and stop stifling your feelings because your husband told you you're overreacting. You are not. He does not have the right to impose her on you like this."
"You didn't create it. 

Also not telling him would by hiding or lying by omission. So you are taking on blame to protect your husband from his own agency. Your husband should be able to choose what kind of relationship he wants with his brother. Hiding this from him is taking away his agency. "
"She's just wrong, what would have been rude is for you to leave a group event to sit in a private booth with just your girlfriend leaving all your friends to basically feel weird and leave."
"I mean it’s not like she is asking you to hand her 380$. The $380 isn’t just for her, it’s for a vacation that everyone who pays that $380 is suppose to enjoy. That sounds like a reasonable amount for a vacation. I think your title and attitude about the whole thing is kind of misleading. Like I don’t know if you meant to imply she was selfish for asking this of you, but it kind of comes across that way. 

That said, no you aren’t obligated to go. If it’s not something you want to spend your money on then don’t. You deciding what you want to do with the money you work for is never unreasonable. Tell her you’ll go to dinner with her in your area for her birthday instead or something. 

Edit: but if you go around telling everyone in your friend group the things you shared here, honestly you will look like an asshole. It’s fine to have this opinion. It’s fine to decide not to go. But gossiping about how your friend, who is putting a effort into planning a fun trip for everyone, is being unreasonable just cus she doesn’t want to pay for other people’s vacation will make you look really really bad. "
This is something you should probably expect when you’re 37 and dating a 24 year old.

"I agree with most of this except:

&gt;You at a minimum need therapy - together and separately 



OP, you are being abused. 
Do not attend therapy with your abuser.  A good therapist wouldn’t do it anyway. Therapy individually for you-it could help her as well but something tells me she doesn’t believe there’s a problem. 

Edit: actually, she probably does think there’s a problem-you."
"&gt;he confessed that they talked about their relationship 

Of all the problematic issues you raise in your post, this is the worst.  The fact that he would discuss their relationship like that shows that they have crossed so many normal boundaries of friendship that he can't distinguish right from wrong

You are not over reacting.   He's in denial about is own motivation and what he has allowed to happen.    He needs counseling to learn why a married man should not be behaving as he is.  You need counseling to better help you understand why your feelings are totally justified and to stand up to this nonsense."
"Let them know that their actions and reactions here have seriously harmed their relationship with you and it's super selfish of them to try and make an event that is supposed to celebrate your relationship and bond with your partner all about them. Let them know that if they want to keep any relationship with you and have access to any possible grandkids (if you do decide to have kids), then they need to just get over it and move on. But, if they're going to continue to guilt you for getting married with your partner in the way that was best for you and your partner, better to keep them at arms length IMO."
"Then don't do it, clean up after yourself and nothing else. You've told him repeatedly what you need from him and he's done nothing to change. Also I'd suggest reading she divorced me because I left dishes by the sink."
"If he has social anxiety, he was probably scared of apologizing to your mom. That could also explain his silence towards you, he was probably mentally blocked.

This is not a justification though. You did everything right and you werent even in a confronting attitude. He had all the opportunities to at least make you feel better.

Either he has a serious mental underlying issue or, even if it’s hard for him, he doesnt care enough to just try and get his shit together for you.

I would try and approach to him again, ask him if he has something to talk about, that you care for him and you’re worried and trying to help. If he’s still remaining passive, maybe it would be time to let him go? This was a “small” thing, but in the future you will have to face bigger events together, and you need someone who knows how to react."
"This is what makes the story from plausible to big fat fucking lie. Bullet lipsticks at most with lots of bad luck break off when dropped, broken pressed powders, okay, or even a shattered foundation bottle if it's a tiled or stone floor and the bottle is glass. But squished lipstick? Hell. NAH. "
"Screw her feelings, you all deserve privacy and peace in this very difficult time and if she doesn't get it that's her issue. Your BIL needs to suck it up and tell her to back off. "
"No one’s mentioned this yet, but get some motion activated sprinklers. "
"I think the quickest way for him to send a signal to her and to get a better sense of her intentions would be for him to offer for the two of you to do something with her. Have her over for dinner or something. If she's innocently just pursuing a friendship with him, this won't be a problem. If she's looking for something romantic with him, she will not like this option."
"Are you sure this is someone you see a future with? Or is this going to be a relationship where you'll always live apart and only visit for short times? You seem to have incompatibilities in very important areas, the daily stuff where you'll be annoyed fast. You don't seem to want to move in at all.

She's a grown up and if she feels lonely, this is something she should dive into with counseling or find hobbies with more friends.  Since she also was with others when she was feeling lonely, perhaps you should encourage her to address it in therapy, as in: it's not related to the relationship and it's unfair to expect you to fill her void. 

It's easier to break up when she hasn't dumped all her stuff in your home or vice versa. Perhaps you should consider that."
It’s how anyone would interpret it. Your husband is having an affair. I’m sorry to be so harsh but how low is your self-esteem and self-respect for yourself and your daughter that you think you should tiptoe around this so you won’t “upset” your cheating husband who is entertaining a girl purposefully trying to ruin your marriage?! You need to escalate this to 100 instead of letting your husband AND this girl trample all over and disrespect you. It’s humiliating for your family that he’s doing this in front of all your coworkers/friends. 
Oh it absolutely is. Your brother doesn’t have to let her in on anything other than what to pack and when they have to leave for the airport. 
"I'm sorry this happened to you. This is always the thing with online relationships - the chemistry and level of attraction may be completely different in real life, face to face interactions. Sometimes it's for the better irl, sometimes it's not there at all.

I think you need to pull back from this relationship and make sure you no longer invest this much in the future when the relationship is online only. It's great to have online buddies and I don't rule out people meeting and beginning dating through games or discord groups or even reddit. But the online world is easy. You can't touch the person, you can't smell them, you can't notice all the little gestures that we intuitively recognise that tell us how the person is feeling.

So next time you are interested in somebody online, meet up ASAP. Or date more irl, so you can make the face-to-face connection soon so you can see if the chemistry is there, if you click well. Take this as a lesson learned and go no contact with this guy for a while to get over him."
"Yea this sounds a little suspicious, unless the lipsticks jumped hard by themselves head over. I knock down my stuff all the time too, and never had this level of damage either.

If he did this, it would be really vicious though. Not even about the make up but the act itself. I'd talk to him. Tell him make up just doesn't break like that. See how he reacts. If you feel it was really him, depending on how long you've been dating, yes I'd think about breaking up. This is concerning behavior."
"You seem to have a lot of guilt about the fact that you’re angry at your mother and resentful of your sister. You have every right to be angry, this situation is extremely unfair to you. Hopefully over time you’ll be able to let go of those feelings of anger and resentment and rebuild a healthy relationship with your sister. A therapist or counsellor might be able to help with that."
"He's probably broke and really insecure about it. That's why you pushing the money thing (a totally reasonable thing to do, if he's broke he shouldn't be spending money) made him get defensive and spew out unrelated lies to boost his hurting ego."
I totally agree with this. I would contribute $5.00.
Do at least his friends or family know about you? It not perhaps his ex is not truly an ex and you might in fact be the other woman
"Although I can see why you feel a little uncertain about this (and I would too as I have problems with jealousy) I do think that he was just comforting her in a difficult time. I have several very close guy friends that I’ve grown up with and if they were going through such a tough time then I wouldn’t hesitate to comfort them in that way. Although yes it does blur the boundaries of what’s acceptable in a relationship I feel that this is such a specific, one-off situation that he was just doing a good thing and trying to help a friend in need. As long as it’s not constantly recurring I really don’t think this is a problem. She does need to find comfort and support in other places though. Maybe you can make sure she gets the professional help she needs? "
"Yeah he declined your dance invitations everlasting times, so you should decline a dance with him at your wedding  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "
"&gt; People with “normal” families cant understand what the rest of us go through...  
&gt;  
&gt;Your family wouldn’t be proud of your success, they would be envious and use it against you.

Man.  This is EXACTLY right.  My family will never EVER see me as a success, just a confusing woman who didn't have children, and doesn't get involved. "
I'd argue you trying to extract that promise from him during that situation was getting him to promise while under duress.
"OP, let me summarize it for you.
What you do, is you tell your gf that you are not sure about your relationship. Do the nice thing, break up with her.

Your gf is being stupid as well, but just because she is being stupid doesn't mean you have to also be stupid.

Your gf clearly counted on being your life partner. Your earning potential is very high. But, this entire post has been a way to distract yourself from the true issue, which is not money but your hesitancy around her.

Do not let her sacrifice more in the HOPES of one day becoming your wife and mother of your kids. You are clearly not in that mood or mindset yet, at all, and dragging her along for another 3-5 years is going to turn cruel.


For perspective though, I hope you realize why your excuses sound thin to her. Because you grew up upper-middle class, it is very hard for you to contextualize what is ""normal"" and what isn't. Do you realize that the piddly earnings you make in Residency also put you over the national median for HOUSEHOLD income? 

In her, and many others' eyes, if you can't make it work on a 60k income now and a 350k income later, then 99% of the US should not be having kids. 

If you're going to have a convo with her on the future of your relationship, keep it about emotions and how you feel about her. Do you love her? Do you see a real future with her? If not, let her go. But don't spin this bullcrap about debt and money, it's going to be borderline insulting to her, who grew up with less as a family than what you're churning for residency. "
"Definitely nothing like death, illness, moving, or career change. If there's been problems at her job or with her friends, she hasn't told me, but I wouldn't guess this is the case. Nothing significant is coming to mind. Our lives are pretty uneventful and comfortable."
He is... acting like a huge asshole. It's not like you asked him to do anything that would take more than 30 seconds. Is he always like this or is this a development since the ankle?
"Regardless of context, if someone lies to me multiple times regarding a concern I've communicated to them, I cut them out of my life. 

I don't want to be the person to just say ouh divorce.. did you two ever do counseling?"
"Yeah this is really the only solution. She *ruined a kids birthday* and has no regrets; she's not going to change anytime soon. Just stop telling her this stuff. Invite her to stuff late so she misses the fun part, or just don't invite her at all. If she asks why she's left out, just say ""Oh, you clearly don't enjoy these kinds of things, so we didn't want to make you uncomfortable.""

If your brother won't go along with leaving her out of stuff, I hate to say it, but you may have to start excluding him, too."
"Those are not your only two options. He is being inconsiderate. If you do not want an open relationship, do not start one, because you will feel like he is cheating and it will destroy your relationship. Both parties need to be 100% ok with this and he cannot make you feel that way. "
"&gt;He won’t even have sex with me when I’m feeling horny because I “don’t want to fuck him like he wants”
&gt;

This makes me think it isn't about your ""low libido"" at all. He wants an excuse to have sex with other women and will stubbornly make sure he gets it. He's clearly not trying to work with you, despite you evidently trying. If it was only about him needing sex, he wouldn't be rejecting you when sex was offered.

I bet he would flip his shit if you suggested a traditional open relationship, one in which you could get your sexual needs met as well, because he clearly isn't doing it. But he doesn't care about your needs, only his.

It doesn't sound like this relationship is salvageable. Even if you give in to his selfish request, your self-esteem and self worth will crumble. How are you ever supposed to have your sex life with him improve once he's been with other women? He clearly already resents you for ""not letting him"" have sex outside the marriage. You'll resent him if you're forced to agree to tolerate his other women. Open relationships require a huge amount of trust and respect to work, neither of which your relationship has.

 If you honestly want to try make this relationship work, discuss this topic with a marriage counsellor and him. Don't feel like this is your fault, and don't let him guilt you into feeling bad that you find a selfish husband who is thirsty for other women a turn-off. If you want to make this work, the root cause of your waning libido needs to be addressed, and a bandaid ""let him sleep with others"" isn't it. Good luck.
"
"The fact that you have ""learned to deal with her for the sake of your husband"" puts me very, very much in doubt that he will do anything to protect your son against her. In fact, he may fight you on it, on the grounds of ""keeping the peace"" in the family.

Please, please don't let him put his mother's ego above your son's safety. She *cannot* be allowed near your son, no contact whatsoever, and your husband *needs* to be a part of this."

"Early married husband here. This totally resonates with me. We don't have kids though, but it's when my wife would act like a mother towards me that my attraction to her, subconsciously, would drop.

It's definitely something we're both working on, and we've been talking about it openly to each other. I never realized it was an issue until I heard someone talk about the topic of why many men lust after other women and lose the attraction to their wives.

Obviously, there's many matters involved and in no way do I excuse or condone that kind of behavior. It needs to be addressed and worked with. And if the husband is giving the wife reason to act like his mother, he needs to do one better in that department. And vice versa.

But I can definitely nod along to this comment and while this may or may not be OPs issue in their marriage, this is definitely a big one for many marriages, my own included."
"You seem to be placing way too much of the problem on yourself.  There are a lot of physical and mental reasons why he may have a lowered libido.   Assuming that is the root cause, he should address it.  But addressing self-embarrassing health problems is a tough task for most men (and women)."
"I feel you're way under-reacting here. Like wtf. Why are you even questioning whether he's entirely out of line. And while he's the married one, she's a total idiot person herself.

The appropriate reaction here is to take your daughter and get out for at least a week. He's so way past boundaries that he absolutely knows he is and just doesn't care. He's got zero respect for you or your marriage, and everyone involved knows it's not an IF they eventually hook up, but just WHEN. Their communication goes way past an ego-boost, and he's throwing you under the bus.

To me, the only way to stop this, if there is one, is doing something very drastic, eg leaving for a while, to communicate that you're serious. If he uses this time to cheat, you know you need a divorce.

You need to get some self-respect. I don't want to be mean, but I really don't understand why you're even unsure if you're being reasonable."
"This is the best answer OP. 

People on this sub like to say everything is gaslighting and is really dilutes the word, but this is exactly what gaslighting looks like. Make no mistake - he is in the wrong here and he is succeeding on making YOU feel like you’re in the wrong. Say it over and over as much as you need to - his behaviour is unacceptable and you’re not gonna put up with it anymore. 

Take steps to get him out of your life for good. Bring his dog to one of his friends/family. Contact your landlord and tell them that your ex has abandoned the property and you need to get out of the lease. Tell your friends what happened and let them help you if you trust them. Contact a lawyer about the car and any other shared property. 

You can do this. 
Let us know how things are going and come back with any specific questions if you have them. "
Thanks for the update. Good for you all for communicating so much. I'm really happy it worked out well.
"It probably is to be honest, I haven't met her so I can only make assumptions. It's a bit sad that this is happening, especially that he's missing the wedding of one of his friends now. "
"You need to put your foot down for this one. You can't control where mil moves to but you do control how little or much interaction you have with her, and this should include the kid. You and your partner need to be on the same page for this. Tell him you do not want his mother to come over, have the kid by herself, etc. That you think she has abused him, and she's still abusive and mean and that you don't want someone like that in your life. Tell him if she moves, she is not going to come over more than 2-4 x a year (or whatever), that you will not be part of her life in any way so she will have no one here.
"
"You're in for ANESTHESIOLOGY and you're worried about your DEBT?

Seriously, either you are not being honest with yourself and her, or you are an extremely pessimistic person. I was thinking maybe you were in family, where the earning potential is on the low end. No, you're in Anesthesiology.

You are not thinking about your partner, at all. You keep thinking 1 weekend a month free means good dad, but if she has to wait 4 years to get there, it might not be worth it for her. Have you ever considered how horrible it must feel for your partner, because all of her major life decisions are being decided by you, and you're apparently super pessimistic? In her shoes, she must feel like she's drifting in the ocean with no life raft. 

In the overall context: being together SIX YEARS, you being an anesthesiologist, her sacrificing to move with you, and now her wanting a kid at 29, despite it not being perfect timing for YOU - I find her to be 100% reasonable.

Honestly, do you even want to marry her? Your post was really wishy washy about if you even love her, or if you just feel guilty about her sacrifices. 

If you are not sure she is the one, end it, please. If you ARE sure she is the one, work with her to set up a real plan that is not dependent on your debt, because your debt (in THIS specific situation) is a weak excuse. Having a kid when you're in residency, versus when you're working and only have 1 weekend free a month, makes no difference to you. At all. You still aren't there to help, so shouldn't you consider more your partner's feelings, because she would be the one doing most of the work anyway???

"I think in an ambulance is an inappropriate time for you both to be discussing big changes in your lives. revisit the subject with him in a different setting, or in counseling. "

OP, tell your brother to be careful.

EDIT: Thread just got locked. Thank you for all the... interesting discussions, everyone."
"YES. It's so **exhausting** dealing with people where you have to argue and defend every single point of every single sentence just to break even and agree on baseline reality. Add to that being sick, and forget it.

What about when kids are in the picture? Will she refuse to take OP's kids to the doctor because they are faking? Demand counseling at a bare minimum if it's even worth continuing. "
"I think the whole 'work wife/husband' thing is disrespectful and strange.  I say that as a married woman with a close male work friend.  

The fact is, the funniest jokes have a grain of truth in them.  I'm not sure if the grain of truth is that your husband and the woman are the most mature/nurturing people in the office, or if the joke is that they have a crush on each other.

The real problem is that your husband is dismissive of your feelings.  It doesn't matter if he thinks it's silly, it bothers you, and that's what's important. A simple ""My wife wouldn't like that, and you know how that goes"" from him could've shut down the 'work wife' business and that Christmas card without really rocking the boat at work.

I think you need to talk to him about it, and ask him to put a stop to the 'jokes.'"
"Honestly? I would dump. Anyone who would literally sabotage their partners items based on their own tastes are weak and likely to do other passive aggressive stuff to get their way. It is a poor character indicator. Is he going to shrink your clothes next? Get rid of snacks you like and he doesnt? Make you only watch his shows and complain about your favorite songs bc they aren't his preferred genre? Throw away your decor? I am exausted thinking about what he will do next, because if he gets his way he is bound to do this stuff again. I mean, it is a super weird thing to do and I have had lipstick open in my purse and dropped it, and it still didnt smush.  You gotta apply force after extending it and that requires twisting :/"

"This is exactly what I was going to say. And actually, stepping back shows that he *is* a decent guy - he knows how his actions could have been misconstrued to a third party. And if he gets a reputation for getting a little too friendly with his female students, that’s a career ender right there. OP’s own integrity could potentially have been questioned too. He’s protecting both of them by stepping back. Sorry, OP. Maybe if you make it clear that you’re intending to be strictly professional for a while, he’ll realise you got the message and can trust you not to cross boundaries - not that this is your fault. But you do need to cool it with the chatty, sightly inappropriately friendly messages. "
"You are under reacting. Cut this guy 100% out of your life. He think it is ""a joke: to cause physical harm to you. Would it be ""a joke"" to hide insulin, blood pressure medicine, seizure medication, etc? 


Messing with meds is dangerous. It isn't even about missing one dose. If he throws off the amount in your system it can cause issues for awhile before your body regulates. 


Tell him he put you at risk and he is lucky you don't call the cops (unless you want to) and then stop talking to him. Block him on social media and his phone number and if for any reason he has a key or something, change your locks. "
"&gt; I listen more and keep my self centered egotistic attitude in check

Apparently not, considering you have been fucking with and using this girl for three years...

You told her you loved her for a full year, and then dropped the bomb on her that you didn't? Then, proceeded to waste further *years* of her life because there's ""no use cutting it off right now""?

If you think that you are capable of singlehandedly ruining school, or work, or life for her if you break up with her, you're kidding yourself. If you break up with her, she'll find someone who treats her better than you did and who actually gives a crap about her.

&gt; I plan on talking to her about this at some point, but keep putting it off because she's so happy right now and I'm afraid that we will end up breaking up and it will hurt both of us so terribly.

Yes, if you tell her you've been fucking with her all this time and don't actually see a future together, never actually loved her, but kind of want to stay together for the emotional crutch function, you are probably going to end up breaking up. As you should, because it's fucked for you to waste any more of her time. There's no way to be in a relationship with someone for three years, end it, and not hurt them at all."
"&gt;My brother told my boyfriend he was just trying to help him because he wouldn't want to date someone with my history.

This says it all.  Your family views you as damaged goods and cannot accept that others may not.  Your parents stood by and let your brother humiliate you because they agree with your him.

See if you can make an urgent appointment with your therapist then take steps to put as much distance from your family as you possibly can.  

Have your parents ever talked to your therapist?  It seems to me they need some counseling of their own."
And he could’ve asked me first or mentioned it before going on tinder. I’m literally the least jealous person ever and have even said I am okay with having a hookup with someone else if he is open about it and tells me. Our relationship has been open in the past but has been quite clearly closed for some time.  He knows he needs to communicate if he wants to reopen things.  But he kept insisting he doesn’t want to do that right now. 
"If she continues to do it, despite you having already told her not to in public situations, you'll have to tell her to stop when she starts. When she starts doing it in an inappropriate situation, tell her not to and move her hands away from your ears if you have to. Of course, do so gently and try not to cause a scene."
"&gt;There are incredible changes that occur in the four years between 17 and 21,

Another way I've heard this said is that you're a different person every three years until you're in your mid to late 20s. Sometimes you grow in opposite directions. It happened to me and my ex after five years together. It sucks, but it's better than pretending to be someone else. "
Why are you with this guy?  Re-read you own post like it’s someone else.  Would you date this person?
"Oh lord, the post history. OP: he lied to you about being divorced. He’s not a good parent. He’s using you. You need to throw the whole man away."
"This is basically assault. But even if not technically so, fundamentally he decided that what **he** wanted you to do with **your own body** was more important than what **you** wanted to do with **your own body**. Your feelings about something were irrelevant to him because they conflicted with his feelings. Do you not see how that's a fucking terrifying attitude for someone to have? If he can do it about alcohol, what's to stop him doing it with sex? This isn't trying to talk you into drinking and being annoying about it, this is forcing something on you against your will.

You're not overreacting, you're underrreacting. **Get pissed off**. Don't ""hope"" for an apology, demand one, and don't hang out with him until you get one and he truly understands how he made you feel. Tell him his actions are making you reconsider being in a relationship with him. Tell him his actions made you feel like he doesn't give a shit about your feelings or autonomy. This isn't ""not being considerate"" this is being a major fucking asshole. If he wants a girlfriend who drinks he should go and find one, not force you to do something you don't want to do."

"Hmm... It would have been in the 'bothersome, but ultimately out of your control' category until I read the part about you all sharing a cabin.

"My girlfriend is a therapist and she said: ""Quite a lot of men react badly when they see their partner express strong emotions. They value what they perceive as emotional resilience and feel an awkwardness and frustration when someone gets upset. It sounds like he's uncomfortable with seeing her cry or get angry so he's putting the pressure on her to fix her emotional state so he doesn't have to witness it and be supportive. I would tell her to explain to him that 'in arguments, getting upset is how I express myself, and I would like you to recognise that your role isn't to dismiss my emotions. I'm wondering whether it's difficult for you to see me upset. Is that true?' The other thing is that she shouldn't be apologising for arguments she hasn't caused, especially if he's not accepting her apologies, as that will lead to built up resentment if she is the only one trying."""
"Kids who grow up in a religious fundamentalist homeschooling environment are frequently behind their more mainstream peers in emotional development. It wouldn’t shock me at all if this kid WAS roughly 7 or 8 years old in terms of his ability to regulate his emotions and impulses. He sounds bored and angry and lacking in healthy outlets. If Dad is bored and angry too, it will never occur to this kid that what he’s doing is not normal kid mischief. That it is, in fact, threatening and alarming and a major invasion of privacy. 

I imagine if he gets in trouble with his parents at all, it’ll be for sneaking out without permission and/or getting too close to “the seculars” while unsupervised. Not for making threatening gestures at them while they sleep or meddling with their decorations. "

"Tech savvy here, your bf has been doing it. Is it possible that he is the victim of some elaborate conspiracy? Not in my opinion, and that is the only other option. This was not a glitch or error.

The only possible innocent excuse is if you logged in to your snapchat on his phone, somehow setting your account as primary, logging you in automatically and forcing him to log out then back in every time. Even in this situation he would have told you years ago instead of deny it.

Dump him, change your passwords on everything and you may even want to get a new phone. I'm serious. Scorched Earth This Mofo. 

Do not let him gaslight you. Tell him you got confirmation and know it was him if he tries. If he demands how give him a vague non-answer(he is not entitled to explanations anymore).

-his phone's mac address was recorded along with date/time/loc (this is something that cannot be changed or altered without some actual knowledge-and there is never an honest reason to do so)

-he checked your snap multiple times while on local or public security cameras(this is almost certainly true but in reality almost no security camera has high enough resolution to capture what is on someone's screen)

"No one believes this was an accident. You deserve better.

This is aggressively controlling and blatant. He has clearly demonstrated a willingness to sabotage your choices to get his way. Do you honestly believe this behavior will never surface in any other area? Or get better with age? What happens when you take a job he disapproves of? Make a friend he dislikes? I’d be surprised if this is the only time he’s manipulated a situation to gain control.

You can brush this off as a small thing but it is, in fact, a huge red flag. You disagreed with his opinion, spoke your mind and continued to do the thing of which he disapproves. He stepped in, took away your choice, and feigns innocence while expecting you to not only go along with his lie but to also “forget it.” And why wouldn’t he? He’s gotten his way. It’s over. It’s done. He’s gotten away with insinuating himself into a controlling role in your life. All of this AND you’ll be out money for new makeup that will only end up broken or disappearing a little at a time.

I say confront him and ask yourself some serious questions if he continues to lie and expect you to pretend to believe his lie. Or worse, actually thinks so little of your intelligence that he truly believes he can convince you this lie is truth.

If he uses the words, “you just don’t remember what really happened”/ “you’re insane if you think that” or any variation of those two things...

My ex used to do this to me. One time he brought an item home from the store that I had wanted for a year. The way we structured our finances was such that I wasn't able to get it for myself. I had asked for it for Christmas the year before and my birthday the year before and this birthday. He brought it home, unwrapped and said it was a mother's day gift for his mom. I nodded and just went on with my day, feeling really hurt. He kept coming into the room asking me ""isn't my mom going to just love that present! I may give it to her early, I'm so excited!""and this went on all day until I broke down crying and finally he said ""HAHHAA I GOT YOU, IT'S REALLY FOR YOU.""

If you'd written everything else apart from that, I'd say that it sounds like you're much happier and I'm glad you both can still be friends. Exes can definitely be friends, I'm still friends with my ex, but if one of you is friends with the other hoping that you will one day get back together, it just seems unfair. If he isn't over you, it's time to give him the opportunity to get over you, in my opinion. You can do whatever you want to obviously, just don't be surprised if he completely cuts contact with you when you start dating someone else. Because whenever you see each other, he's hoping that will be the time to rekindle your relationship.

I also feel like this is why he's working on himself. You left him because he was gross and lazy, and he cleaned up too late. He's now improving himself, getting in shape and being healthy because he thinks that's what you want. Have you spelled out to him that there's absolutely no chance in hell that you'll get back with him? That it wasn't just the hygeine at the end, but that you aren't in love with him anymore?

"Your husband flat out doesnt get it. I was raised in a nuclear family like his, and my mom was raised in a family more like yours.  It's amazing to me how Pollyana some people can be in the way they look at family.  If I were you, i would be hurt that he doesn't seem to believe what you're telling him, but it sounds like he has the capacity to understand if he has more information. I would advise giving him illustrative examples of why you've made the decisions you've made about your family. "
"I think this is the real problem. His opinion is valid and not egregiously unreasonable (though I don't share it). But to trash talk your choices while you're _in costume_ is an asshole move.

I think it's a good chance to see what the heck is going on. See how the fiance is and how they interact with her children and maybe get to the bottom of all your whys. He could be intensely happy or have gone cuckoo. Is it possible to keep the toddler away if you can. You should just go solo because you'll need all hands on deck for your covert op mission. 
OP actually has no money.  They are in debt. 
She's shown you that she can be less than forthcoming. She can't be trusted. You need to protect yourself (and your rights as a parent) legally.
"Some advice for next time, don’t continue casually fucking people who you have no intention of dating after they’ve told you they love you. It will really help you avoid these sorts of “crazy” situations and people in the future.  "
"No, I do not think it is reasonable to end your friendship over this. She did not come between you. You chose to share something, she responded in a way that did NOT cause harm to your relationship with your husband. You are absolutely right that the consequence is disproportionate to the transgression. Your husband is being extremely unfair and causing you an incredible amount of pain. He's just embarrassed that someone else heard about what he thought were private details. But you know what? Everyone needs close friends that they can feel comfortable confiding in! Including you! 

I hope that you all are able to resolve this situation and you can have your friend back. 

"
"If he's not your family and they are, then they should be paying for your college and not him."
"I think if she valued the friendship less than you, she would have kept the whole $200. It was a kind gesture on your part but to her it must have seemed like too much for the occasion. Hang on to the other $100 and regift it once baby arrives in diapers or prepared meals! I think it was appreciated at the end of the day but I get why you feel the way you do. Don't over think this one. If you can't let it go, talk to her about how you feel. :) "
"There is litterally no chance these videos are actually deleted.

And there is no chance this behavior will never be repeated.

Tell your friends."

"You say ""a few dozen hours"" like it's nothing, but 60-80 hours is a lot of time he would be losing. That's essentially two full work weeks. I love my family and I actually do free work for them: I'm a teacher and I do free SAT prep (for which I normally charge $40/hr) for my sister. But if they asked me to take two weeks off my actual paying job to do that full time, I would laugh in their faces. And they would never ask because they realize what an unreasonable imposition that is. It's unfair to imply that OP doesn't care about his family because he is prioritizing his actual paying career over doing them a favor.

And for what it's worth, my mom is a real estate agent, and even though I help her and my sister out for free, I would NEVER expect her to work for me without taking commission."
"Really, it sounds like the family is emotionally abusive, especially what your brother did. "
"THIS. At two weeks post-partum, I was a hormonal / emotional wreck. Crying everyday, still trying to figure out breastfeeding, running on zero sleep... and I had an ""easy"", complication-free pregnancy and delivery, and my baby was not colicky or sick or anything. I would not entertain this idea as far as I could throw it. Your husband may also simply not realize what is in store (tbh you probably don't either - I sure didn't). Maybe solicit some input from a couple close friends / sisters (and their partners??) to really drive home the point to him about how earth shattering bringing a newborn home is"
"You finally did the right thing.  You should have gotten rid of her a long time ago.

Stay strong.  She will likely do some horrible manipulating stuff to try and force her way back in, because people like her have trouble finding people that will put up with their shit.  Do not let her back in or you will regret it."
"I got so heated reading this post. I think she is an awful person. She knows this is a family tradition that everyone enjoys, yet she wants to ruin it. Why? Probably because she is miserable and takes some sort of joy in ruining things for people, and having some sort of “control” over the situation. "
"Even though I identify with your style more, and your mom sounds badass, I think that perhaps you are both a bit extreme in your points of view. 

Ok, dumpster diving is recycling. I have gotten some useful stuff from it, particularly in college towns. That being said, you are a bit naive for letting what amounts to strangers into the student dining hall. I say this as someone whose first friend in my current city was a toothless drug user who lived in a van. She was a nice, intelligent lady who helped me get oriented, and I would help her out with gas or whatnot, but yannow, she was pretty clearly a drug addict and as such not someone I could have granted access to somewhere that had Stuff to Steal. 

Sorry, hon, but you do sound a bit naive. Talking to people =/= knowing them. Life is complex. If something had happened, it would have been on your head. 

If you want to help the homeless, learn more about how to really help and then support an organization that does well, or start a program that forwards fresh food that would otherwise be disposed of. Don't just take the easy way out and clap yourself on the back for being Awesome. 

Asking for free upgrades politely? Sounds smart. 

Misrepresenting yourself as a student? Not fair to the other students. Not all businesses are monolithically soulless ripoffs. Small businesses often have very tight profit margins. Circumventing the policy might cause the business to stop offering the discount at all because of too many people taking advantage. 

I encourage both of you to process your philosophies of life and think of the greater ramifications of your actions. Your boyfriend seems a bit rigid, and you need to consider the greater impact of your actions instead of reflexively Sticking it to the Man. "
"I would refuse to get back with her unless she promised to get professional help for her psychological issues related to her upbringing. 

Actually, I would break up with her regardless, but if you're going to stick it out, make sure she gets psychological help. Imagine the harm her mentality could do to a child if they got married and chose to have kids. "
"It's also possible that he has nudist tendencies and this is an avenue for him to express it.

I mean, it's not all that shocking that he would want to hide it. Just look at the reaction is this thread - everyone is saying that he's weird and maybe gay.

He could just be comfortable being naked and comfortable being naked around other people being naked but he doesn't know how his partner would react and is embarrassed"
I’m Asian and my past exes were black and was kinda in the same position. I told my parents about them and just did what I had to do. My parents were never the reason my relationships ended and my gfs never ended things with my parents.
"Maybe he feels insecure about his financial situation and your friends being well off? He could be trying to overcompensate by paying the entire tab because he is afraid your friends think he’s less financially able. 

My brother does this. He pays the entire tab to “show he’s not poor” because he’s insecure about still living with my parents. "
"Wow. Um. Honestly, I'm appalled for you. You're too young for this nonsense. A good boyfriend, who actually shows he loves you and cares about you, would not constantly poke at you like this. Though I say poke, it honestly sounds more like a jab. I know that the general advice in subs like these isn't to jump straight to breaking up but honey, if he is constantly making you feel like crap... Why are you with him? It is not okay for him to say stuff like this to you, friends, family, anyone. It isn't normal. "
"Short Answer - Listen to your wife.

"This is exactly right. OP, I hope you won't waste much of your precious time on closing this out, wishing for what might have been. It might feel like he killed that dream but it can still happen. Just not with him."
"If you give in to her, you’ll be teaching her that her threats will work. Just screenshot the threats and show them to people if she tried to slander you. 

If you’re worried she’s going to hurt herself, reach out to her friends or family and ask them to keep an eye on her.

Keep blocking her. "
Yeah this is the action of a psychopath.
"I don't think that it would be right to ask her to wax, especially a specific part. I think that it would just make her more self-conscious. I have a similar hair situation, and I know it would do that to me! I understand that people say people have a right to their preferences, but it just seems rude to ask someone to do something painful, time consuming, and expensive for a minor dislike. 

Perhaps you can try overexposing yourself to it, in a sense. Touch her stomach more and try to appreciate that this is how she is made and that's great? "
"My vag would dry up, too, if I had to deal with a man as selfish as that."
"My kid had a similar problem with her SO. Her solution was to tell him that if he told her every detail of his day as it happened, they wouldn't have anything to talk about at the end of the day.

It worked surprisingly well and no feelings were hurt."
"Your BF is extremely insecure, hypocritical and immature. If you can't talk about fictional characters then neither can he. Make sure to call him out on this. I could care less that my wife has celeb crushes which is basically the same thing. She also doesnt care if I like a few sexy pics on instagram. We both want eachother at the end of the day. I don't feel you are overreacting, I feel he is."
"&gt;I'm considering offering to split our expenses in a more weighted way, so instead of 50/50 we could split it 56/44 to account for the extra money that I make for the same amount of time worked.

This is spot on! You should contribute however much you can to the relationship, ideally proportionately.

&gt;Does anyone else weight their expenses when sharing costs with a significant other?

It depends on the situation. For example, if the two of you booked a trip to New York and you decide you want to stay in a 5-Star Hotel but her salary can't afford it, then it would be fair to say that you will contribute more money to funding the hotel stay than she will. It's a simplistic idea but hopefully you get the point.

"If you used the word ""shock"" instead of ""calm"" it may help them understand. You were calm after you were sexually assaulted because you were in shock. I would just send a Facebook private message or text ""thank you all for standing with me after I was groped at the park - I was in total shock and I appreciate your kindness"" and move on with life - you don't need to explain that it was first triggered by your past *unless you want to share that*."
"It sounds like he doesn’t want to stop, so he isn’t going to. He’s just going to continue lying to you. If you haven’t tried couples counseling yet, then do that. If you can’t accept their friendship, then I guess you should leave. He will not stop and he will just get better at hiding it. Probably even with couple counseling."
"If you meet him, I think he will see that as a sign/escalation of your friendship level, and it doesn't sound like that's what you want. I mean, this is a guy who thought it was appropriate to to a surprise drop-in visit to a former acquaintance at 9 PM after not hearing a peep from you for 4 months. To him, meeting for coffee will likely mean that you're now BFFs. Just respond something like ""No need for an in-person apology - the matter has been settled."""

"Thats why I spell it out.  So many people hear ""prank"" and think something that causes harm.  With us, it's that something nice is going to happen to you, but you're going through a little ribbing first, so you can always laugh about it.  The meanest thing I think we have done was convince my dad we had gotten him a meatloaf and mashed potatoes instead of cake for his birthday.  It was actually a cake that just looked like meatloaf that my cousin baked, and my cake-loving dad was thrilled when he realized!"

"WTF?

Tell your girlfriend you want to loan her out a friend to see if s/he wants a girlfriend..."
"&gt; He expects dinner ready when he gets home but complains about it. If I don't get his laundry done by Monday he complains about it. 

Oldest racket in the book. He’s training you to fear his anger and disappointment if you don’t cater to his growing list of demands. He will move the goalposts every time you think you’ve figured out where they are, and nothing will ever be quite up to his expectations. 

A clean home and a warm dinner aren’t the point (or at least only a small part of the point). The point is keeping you tired, insecure, and focused on pleasing him. That’s the kind of relationship that feels satisfying to him. If he wanted an equal he’d be happy to work with you to find a manageable division of labor, but you already know that’s not gonna happen. He wanted a puppy for the same reason he wanted a girlfriend - something he can enjoy and show off when he’s in the mood and ignore when it’s too much work. He’ll treat that dog with the same irritation he treats you when it behaves like a living creature with needs and preferences. He’s already begun. "
The amount of replies that don't seem to care about a real addiction in this thread disgusts me. There is a very big difference between having a few drinks or going out with friends and just drinking for the sake of getting drunk when you're not at work. She has a very real problem and you may be better off leaving her if that is a lifestyle you can't live with.
He is absolutely already talking to their friends and creating a narrative where she’s a crazy bitch who kicked him out of his home and stole his dog and is endlessly harassing him over the phone.  That’s why he doesn’t want her to talk to their friends. He wants to control the story.  
"And why did it not happen in the last 2 months since y’all agreed to do it? Why only now, when he has once again been caught in a lie has he said he would make the appointment? I would bet that it doesn’t happen, again. You should go ahead and look into making an appointment yourself."
"Your parents are awful people, no matter how you dice it. Tell them flat out you aren't using your half-brother like that because you somehow managed to grow up with a bigger conscience than that.

If you aren't interested in a gap year I would suggest finding a job and starting at a community college. Get your A.A. to start and work your way up to your bachelor's. Taking it loans for two years is better than taking out loans for four!"
"If she is THAT insensitive to your feelings and finds it okay to reveal private information about your body parts, then maybe you should end the relationship."
"(1). I would not be with someone who treats me like this. Where is this relationship going? Imagine going through pregnancy with this person. Imagine losing a loved one with this person by your side. Do you trust them to be the support for you that you would need? Do you trust them to give you equal support as you give them?

(2). This is not relationship advice. Please see a doctor. I had a very similar experience to what you described after years of painful periods. In the ER, I discovered cysts on my left ovary and Fallopian tube had ruptured. It’s better to be safe than sorry. "

My mother was a boundary stomper like that too and really struggled with trying to control me when I was already college aged. The only thing that helped was going low contact and moving out.

What she is doing is not normal, appropriate, or necessary. "
You're doing the right thing by leaving this shitty man you can't trust. I promise life will be easier without the weight of the pain of being with him brings.
"Why would you feel pressure to chip in for a gift if you're leaving in a few weeks?

"I think he massively overreacted. He basically blew up at you for not telling him about your personal health issues and what medication you take, and that's PRIVATE. I think I had probably been with my boyfriend for several months before I disclosed my health issues to him and told him about what my medication is for. I take pills every morning and it made me feel more comfortable to tell him what the meds were for, but I also didn't lead with that on the first date.

Your boyfriend is being a moron.

edit: "" He loosely compared it to cheating on him. ""

If my boyfriend compared me not telling him about what my pills are for to CHEATING ON HIM, I would have dumped him. Just my two cents."
You sound like you have great siblings and rubbish parents. 
It’s weird that you say that you think this “might be the road to cheating” when two weeks ago you made a bunch of posts about how you found out she’s cheating...
Just don't go. You have already given her your answer and you don't need to justify it. 
The only compromise (that isn’t really a compromise) is getting a dog. 
"Really? In my relationship, fights usually involve bad behavior from both people. Even when he caused the fight/issue, I absolutely still apologize for what I did wrong. Because I'm not interested in winning, and I care about him and his feelings. When I hurt his feelings, I apologize."
That's why you refer them to someone you hate.

"You’ve said you told him clearly- I’m assuming that means you’ve told him that you’re so unhappy and lonely that you’ve considered divorce? That’s about all you can do. You can’t make him change or try.

You walking away could be fixed. But not by you. HE needs to want to change. He may be your best friend but he’s not acting like one and he’s a terrible partner. I hope things get better for you."
This dude is not your friend. You should absolutely cut him out of your life. 
god thank you *so much* for verbalising this so eloquently!  I see bisexuality treated this way very often and it drives me mad. 
"Okay, she's your boss.  Keep that in the front of your mind.

Rather than call her out when she's doing it or running to HR, I recommend you take her out to lunch and talk one-on-one about how you've noticed that she seems to be less attentive during your conversations than when she's listening to others and ask her what you can do to reinforce critical points that you need her to absorb.  Ask if she would prefer one-on-one briefings, one-sheet papers, or some other method of information conveyance.

You could instead say that ""people have noticed"" instead of just you to give more weight to your talk but that runs the risk of her wanting you to name names.  You'll have to use your knowledge of her personality to decide what to say.

This approach:

* Takes some of the power imbalance away by being off-site in a more intimate setting
* Doesn't point out what could be a medical problem in front of others
* Underscores that she's missing critical information
* Shows her that you are willing to change to meet her preferred communication style, and
* Allows her to save face.

It may well be that something about your delivery or content is boring to her and she might never mention it if you don't bring it up."
Ellie is the plot twist super villain of this story. 
"Yup, now she’s even further involved with his life for years to come. “It was a one time thing” doesn’t fix this.

"You don't need to apologize for what you are or aren't attracted to, and you should break up with Christine if you're not interested in being in a relationship with her. That doesn't make you a bad person or anti-trans.

"AHHH THIS is what you should have added.

This changes the ENTIRE picture.

What residency are you in, for what field or specialty?

For me, this drastically changes the picture. All fields of medicine clear 6 figures. And most med students have over $100k of debt. This is no longer some crazy horrible situation. It's extremely common and the fact you presented it so vaguely and like it's a death knell is VERY bizarre. Surely, you speak with your classmates?...I bet many of them even have kids already...

If those are the only things stopping you, you need to be more realistic. Your earning potential is very good, unless you flunk out - but at residency that's very rare. However, you must have already realized that as a resident and future doctor, your time isn't going to become MORE free.....

So what's your goal? You're going to wait to have kids until you have free time and no debt, aka you're gonna wait til you're 45?

You need to rethink this realistically, and also consider if you need to break up with her or not. It sounds like part of you doesn't want to be with her and you're only doing it out of obligation because of her sacrifices. But let me tell you, the only thing shittier than leading someone on for 6 years, is leading them on for 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, and ruining their chances for children for LIFE.

If you want to wait until you're 45, and with someone else, FINE. BUT TELL HER ASAP. 

Edit to add: Now that I know you're a soon-to-be doctor, sorry, but your excuses become paper thin. You can be scared of moving forward in your relationship, just be honest about it. Or maybe your relationship is unhappy right now and you aren't sure if she's ""the one"". That's ALSO a very relevant fear, and you need to be honest. But ""money"" and ""debt""? She can see right through these excuses and this is likely why she is unhappy and pressuring you. 

I have so many friends in residency, going into residency, or just past residency. None of them are putting their entire life on hold until they clear debt. It is completely unrealistic. You're going into one of the most time-demanding fields. How are you going to juggle your personal life after residency? Unless you're going into peds or family outpatient, you realize it's not gonna get that much easier right?..... You're going to have to learn to accept that life is not perfect but that, realistically, as a doctor, you are a top earner in your country. "
"You said she just started doing this about a year or so ago. Just throwing it out there that she might be seeing/talking to someone else? Especially if she spends a ton of time away from home and with her friends and whatnot. Is she protective over it?

"Yeah, I was reading this feeling increasingly suspicious about your fiance until I got to the part about you both being very drunk. Very drunk me has had a proper shouting match with my best friend about whether someplace was a nightclub or a bar. Our ability to use normal words normally had gone out the window."
"I would make sure he didn't have a place in my wedding. I would ask my husband's father, grandfather, cousin, or friend to walk me down the aisle, dance, and make the speech. If your dad says anything, and I know this sounds petty, I would say, ""I'm just giving you back what you gave me my whole life. Sister was always number 1 with you. You treated me like I was second best. Now you get to see how it feels."" Not only would it save you the disappointment, but it will show him how you feel."

"Nooooooooooooooooooo. This is a hill you need to die on. This woman is going to try and completely take over taking care of your baby. She will criticize everything you do and you will have no one there to run interference. And when she doesn't get her way she will cry to your husband who won't stand up for you.

Two weeks is way too soon. And several months is way too many. Having a baby is amazing and terrible all at once. You need people around who will support you, not drive you crazy. Put your foot down. Hard."

Get up, leave.  Don't be their childcare, cook, housekeeper.  Let everyone else sort their own responsibilities."
