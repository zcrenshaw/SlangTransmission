Sounds like you may have some anxiety issues. Maybe see a therapist or psychologist?
Spelling is a totally different level of problem than even knowing what the name is though.
"Bad breath is a pretty good sign of tooth decay or some type of infection in the gums, not only do you tell him - but have him take a tooth brush (maybe a new one) and have him brush certain areas like near the wisdom tooth and gums and after each time he brushes take out the brush and smell it (yeah gross) but it'll give you a better idea of where the smell is coming from so you can tell the dentist to check that area specifically.  


It could also be food getting stuck between a tooth and a gum"
"People are acting like just because a name MIGHT be foreign or strange somehow it's forgivable that a friend of 2 years and a significant other of nearly 1 is excusable. I think that's absolute bullshit. I would think someone who is interested in dating me and loves me would at least know my name and last name. Now you never claimed to have a foreign name or last name, but in my eyes it's incredibly insensitive.

I assume you don't use social media because it would have been pretty easy... 

Like what the others said, I feel like it can be two things. 
1. He needs to get to a doctor or 2. this is some crazy comedy movie where the guy forgets someone's name and spends a long time bullshitting until he finally has to come clean."
"Is he generally quite forgetful? I wouldn’t worry too much or take too much offence. I’ve never had an anniversary because I’ve never remembered the date to begin with and it’s not something guys usual make a big deal about off their own back. I was in a 5 year relationship and the amount of times I facebooked his birthday is embarrassing. My cousin asked me the correct spelling of my Mums name for a wedding invite and luckily I got it right but I had to double check.  It’s not because I don’t care, it’s just like some things just refuse to stick in my brain no matter how hard I try to remember. Everyone’s mind is different.  "
"are you ugly? work on looksmaxing. 

&amp;#x200B;

do guys approach you or show interest in you? maybe ur standards are wayyy too high."
Oh my god girl just count your blessings you didn’t get married and say good riddance!!
What makes this guy a “scumbag?”
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding...
"You know you do not have to find ""the one"" right now. You can take years and if that seems too long, at least months, no? Slow down, stop trying to close the deal right here right now, check out the ones the ones that stick with you for a month?"
Lots of people use nicknames or don’t include their last name on social media. My last name isn’t on any of mine so students can’t find me. 
"I didn't read it all but break up with him I was like this to an ex of mine and looking back I ruined her.

I will have to live with the guilt. "
"Not sure if he meant he didn’t want to have kids with you at all.. just that he doesn’t want them now which makes sense due to his age and the fact you guys aren’t married yet 

But he did say he’s accepted it and will be a great father so while it’s not ideal that your boyfriend isn’t super enthusiastic about it, he’s at least stepping up to his responsibility and at least seems like he’s going to try his best to be a good father to the twins "
We’ve spoken about it and he tried to be supportive but I know him too well I could tell his true feelings and that something was bothering him 
"Your friends are right. He doesn’t make sense, and there is literally nothing you did to deserve that kind of treatment. 

There is clearly something wrong with him; if he wanted to break up with you, he could have been an adult and just *broken up with you* like a normal person. All of the paranoia, silent treatment, tantrums and weird accusations are worrying to me. Regardless of what he said about feeing safe around you, I don’t think *you* are safe with *him.* 

Don’t stew on this anymore than you already have. Clearly you dodged a bullet with this guy. "
How would she get home safely if she were singing karaoke (and drinking) with friends?
"Very much this. I started having really bad memory problems a while back. I was constantly faking stuff with people I knew for years. I had trouble with pulling certain words from my vocabulary and would forget stuff that was happening. Went to the doctor after I got sick but just kept on shrugging off the memory stuff.

Turns out I had a bacterial infection that had gotten into my brain. It took a few rounds of Antibiotics and a few months later I was doing better. Never got 100% but I am pretty decent again. Losing your mind is scary and denial follows scary around wherever it goes. "
Dude sounds like a nut case. 
"Get some toys that take the pressure off him, maybe? Like strokers and battery-operated toys.  That way when he uses them on you it's not him ""doing it the wrong way.""

..hopefully he doesnt think about competing against them though."
"Yep, if you're looking for a guy to have fun with, this doesn't sounds like your guy. Staying in is great and all, and saving money is a legitimate excuse to not do something... But to constantly deny you a proper date or a night out of the house, while you're going out of your way to be with him in his house? That's not right. "
"Well after watching YOU on netflix he's probably a serial killer.. just kidding.  


Anyway he's staring at you because he's more than likely attracted to you and extremely nervous to talk to you. The age difference is the factor here - even confident guys can be intimidated by a women.. ESPECIALLY an older women as they tend to think.. She has her shit together, she's experienced, she's working full-time, she won't be interested in a younger guy.. etc. If you're really wondering what it's like to be with what could be a really great guy - then you might have to be the one to break the ice here... He's giving you a signal but too afraid to act on it. I use to do that in high school where I'd stare at the girl I liked in class and if she turned and caught me I'd quickly turn my head and look somewhere else  


It's not 'hot' to be that shy but hey some guys are and once the ice is broken they can really open up and you'd forget they were ever that shy"

"The question isn't whether he's toxic or not, it's whether he respects your boundaries or not. And he doesn't. 

However, if you've always let him get away with this behavior before, he probably didn't think you really meant it. Now that he sees you really do, you can give him one more chance to see if he will respect a boundary that you maintain. 

The problem is that lots of people put up boundaries...but cave as soon as it comes to actually having consequences. He may have heard this a dozen times before, but no one actually cancels on him. Presumably, you used to be like that. So see if he shapes up now that he knows you mean it, and if can't respect you then either, write him off. "
"He's worried. 

He has a good reason to be. 

You acknowledge his worry, and tell him you're talking to your therapist about this and keep him updated on what you're comfortable with him knowing about your therapy sessions. 

And offer to see a GP about the current weight loss to make sure it's not unhealthy and to have some blood tests done. Just in case there is something metabolically wrong that an endocrinologist could help with (thyroid issues come to mind), in addition to the OCD. I know you said cash is tight, but if there IS something off it's better to catch it now. 

But also, in the meantime, make sure he sees you eating regularly. Tell him that him trying to push certain foods on you is not helping your OCD, but you understand it's because he is worried about your physical health. Ask him what will help him worry less. Seeing you eat AT LEAST once a day (with a total calorie intake that's enough for your age/weight/activity level to maintain weight)? Preparing food with you? Just knowing that you are taking his concern seriously? 

And then try to do those things. "
"Personally, I draw the line at *any* abusive behavior. Whether it's emotional or physical, it's abuse because it's likely going to get worse.

It doesn't matter how he treats you 95% of the time. How he treats you when he's angry is what matters, and you talk about him like he's a ticking time bomb.

&gt; Putting that childhood experience against what I'm experiencing now, the now is nothing.

It sounds like what you went through is terrible but please realize that ""it's better than what I've been through before"" does *not* make it okay. You deserve to feel safe 100% of the time you're around your SO. There should be no doubt in your mind as to whether this person will hurt you.

Please stay safe, OP. You're not overreacting or paranoid. You deserve *much* better.
"
word the ol cuckholding
"My bf’s workplace is weirdly informal with interpersonal relationships. I used to work there and that’s how we met, and like 90% of our social life stems from people we’ve worked with (or currently work with, in his case) there. The boundaries are just really different. So while I definitely get your point about her oversharing, in that environment as weird as it seems, it’s actually pretty normal. And she knew he’d talk to me about it, she just requested he (and by default I) not say anything to anyone else.

But I get what you mean, I really don’t want to make her feel obligated in any way, since she’s got enough relationship stresses going on.

My bf has been talking about bringing her into “our group” for awhile, several months at least, and now I’m kicking myself for us not making it happen. I don’t know how to make it happen now without it seeming forced or a charity case or something. He says she’s seems really introverted and unsure of where she belongs socially, and I got a similar impression when talking to her, so I’m not sure I see her ever initiating anything without us kind of pushing it.

Oh well, at the end of the day she’s an adult. Thanks for your input."
"Slap that bitch some respect into her head and make her delete them and shes better having a good apology for that. 
Also spill the beans, expose her to other family members too they will be on your side and they should know how she truly is"
"Appliances, furniture, and cookware are not 'momentos', they're useful things that cost a decent chunk of money to replace. Not trying to be rude or anything, but unless you're willing to replace all of these things yourself, you need to chill. It's kind of unusual that she bought him *that much* stuff, but it sounds like she was just generous and he sees no reason to toss out perfectly good things just because of who purchased them. The handmade decorations- yeah I get feeling a bit weird that he kept those, but I've also kept a handmade decoration from an ex and it doesn't mean I like being reminded of him or anything, it's just really cool and I still like it even though he was a huge douche. 

TBH if my SO was considering leaving me just because I keep using practical items that an ex gave me, I'd probably show them the door myself. I'm not gonna be wasteful and break the bank to replace a ton of stuff just cause my partner thinks I get warm fuzzies for my ex when I look at the coat rack he bought me. If it makes you uncomfortable then it makes you uncomfortable, but I think you should try to get to the root of WHY it bothers you so much. "
"Considering that he deleted texts from her, admits he loves the attention, and was angry by you being hurt by his actions....I'd say you're dating an asshole. 

Here's some advice: Cheating and breaking relationship boundaries is not a reasonable mistake. It's a series of deliberate choices he made. He made the decision to engage with her in those texts. Then he went off on her as if he's a victim. Furthermore Being depressed is not an excuse to be an asshole or fish for flirting outside your relationship. 

"
"Your ex is an emotional basket case. 

&amp;#x200B;

""That he could never trust or forgive me for my behavior. **That I’m like everyone else** and he is moving on with his life.""

&amp;#x200B;

For so many reasons, this line of thinking is toxic and you are better off without him. You are literally better being alone than to be with someone who thinks like this, because nothing will change their mind and they are so deep in this woe is me idea that they are perpetual victims and you can't reason with them. In the meantime they want to punish others for their extreme paranoia. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ex was very much like this with an added dose of being jealous of my relatively successful life. Instead of being proud of me for my success he made comments about how jealous he was for small benefits that I enjoy for my hard work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway OP, work on moving past this person. It doesn't seem like you two were together for all that long, and the same was with me and my ex. He slathered on a lot of compliments at first and then began accusing me of ridiculous BS. In the beginning he pushed to move fast and I wanted to believe he was a better person than he proved to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your ex is a coward. He may have had valid reasons to feel hesitant about your relationship, but instead of addressing them with you like an adult, he stuffed them underneath ridiculous accusations and jumped on every opportunity to fight with you. This is not treatment that you deserve. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next relationship, promise yourself one thing, that you'll slow down. Anyone who can't deal with moving at a reasonable pace is not worth your time. I'm happy to report I am dating a fun, sane, and patient man who doesn't poison our time together with some off the wall toxic BS. "
He's still married or in a relationship.
You'd be upset if your SO of a year looked you up on facebook?
"I don't feel like I ignore it though I just? dont get it often, but when I do I eat. And my bmi usually hovers around 22-23. Idk if it makes a difference but my meals are usually bigger, when I do get hungry I get very hungry and eat a ton."
"10 years? TEN? This should be a flat out ""We've been together a decade. Marriage is important to me and I would like to have that future with you. What is your plan?"" conversation. If he tells you (as I suspect he will) ""I offered to marry you twice."" then you have to get down into the nitty gritty of what you want vs what he wants. It might be that he doesn't want the romantic proposal and formal wedding, it might be that he only proposes when he's certain you'll say no. Either way he needs to answer honestly and then you can decide if it is time to set a deadline or to make your decision about whether or not you can live with the fact that he has no intention of marrying you.

"This happened with me and my ex. We were together for four years and I could not ever remember his birthday, January 19th. For whatever reason that day is unremarkable to me and just couldn’t stick. It could be that he’s just very forgetful, I’m that way as well. I had an acquaintance all four years of high school whose first name I couldn’t remember and by then it was too late/awkward to ask so I just referred to him as his last name."

I mean, I might not know my friend Jonny is actually Jonathan and not John, or my friend’s last name is Kellen or maybe Keller, etc.... but how do you know someone for a year and date them for a year AFTER that and not even know their surname vaguely? How do you not even WONDER? "

"For me it ended up being a side effect of sleep apnea.

My birthday is also 4/20 and no one ever forgets it because I make sure to joke about it anytime someone asks or finds out.
"These gaps in his memory are either a medical condition or.... I don’t know. It just doesn’t make any sense. If it was just your birthday, that’s a little hurtful but sure. Your FIRST NAME though? I think the first thing is for him to see a doctor. "
"Maybe you could tell her you heard she’s going through a rough time, and if she wants another woman to talk with, you’re here for her. The reason it’s a maybe is bc if she told your bf in confidence, she could be upset he broke that. 

But I’d say be friendly with her, see if she seems to want the friendship, causal things like grabbing a coffee after work, but be careful not to be pushy - you don’t want her to feel pressured to appease the boss’s gf. I’d suggest not inviting her to your house or other places where your bf / her boss would be part of the group, as that might be awkward bc of the power imbalance. "
"I'd be shocked too, not normal. My boyfriend who I've known for 7 years will sometimes pause if I ask him what my birth year is. He's not good with birthdays and is always stressed, doing 10 things around the house at once while working 50 hours a week. I don't consider that abnormal. But what you've described is very abnormal. 

I'd be concerned about a blockage, TIA/mini stroke, early onset dementia, vascular issues, diabetes, tumours, other neurological or psychiatric conditions, drug/alcohol abuse. He should get checked. 

Is he forgetting other things? Does he forget more short term/recent things, long term memories or both? Does he have any other signs or symptoms of anything even if it seems unrelated? "

"Stop replying. She's drunk, high, and young, of course she's annoying. Tell her no and goodnight and text her tomorrow morning."
"&gt; That's a bit harsh to give him the advice to let go of this relationship just because they are facing some difficulties.

A 5 month relationship, yeah I think it would be fair to let it go at this point. "
"Yeah, this sounds like your anxiety. Are you getting any help for that?

Missing your GF while she's away on vacation, and wanting to see her when she gets back, are totally normal feelings, but it sounds like she's being honest with you and you shouldn't doubt her unless you have a good reason."
"You guys have been to couples counselling twice in a 4 year relationship.

I think it's easier to distract yourself with this woman instead of thinking about what you want your life to be.  Did you want to be in a relationship with no sex and dull conversations?  Do you want this for the rest of your life?  

What do you want for yourself? Are you and your husband actually compatible? "

It's great that you have recognized the problems you caused in your relationship, but nobody here is going to encourage you to pursue a woman who has specifically told you she is done with you. Thinking you can win her back after a such short amount of time is delusional and inappropriate. If you cannot accept that, then I'm sorry to say you have more to work on than you realize. "

"Please take this opinion with a salt mine, but I don’t think you consoling him...coddling him is doing anything positi"
"Good luck, I'm pulling for ya!"
"I don't use social media, so that might explain it."
"I'm on board with this possibly being a medical issue. There are things like face-blindness that can cause people to not recognize someone after a haircut and similar, I wouldn't be surprised if there was something like that with names too. People's brains work differently, it might not just be that he doesn't care. 

(If other aspects of the relationship lead you to believe he doesn't care, listen to that. But if it's just this my bet is a medical or neurodivergence thing.)"
"Yeah if he seriously just needs some guidance. I work through my partner's ADD flawlously because I know when to tell him I need him to pay attention and he knows to give me a heads up if he just missed a minute of whatever I was saying/we were doing. But if she seriously doesn't sit down with him.. I mean he HAS adhd, he has to be fully willing to understand that he might be a bit overbearing sometimes right?


We make so many jokes about his ADD and that also helps to normalize any issues that arise from it. He doesn't get angry anymore if he loses his keys for the 1000th time, he just goes ""babe ADD brain made me lose my keys, can you help me find them?"". And then they're right in front of his nose and we both bust out laughing that he missed them."
This guy is nuts. Consider it a bullet dodged OP.

If I shut him down he’ll usually say that he already knows the answer so either way I don’t win ugh. 
"This isn't a big deal for me so hear me out:

There's cousins, aunt, uncles I see everyday who I don't know their full name.
We have ridiculously long names and EVERYONE goes by a nickname.
We actually had to have a conversation once when I had to take my aunt to the hospital and we couldn't even give a full name so now it's in my address book but I would need to check before I told them.
It's not like I have access to their paperwork. 
But everything else from her favorite food, hobbies, fears, car she drives etc I could tell you
Even this last year, I only found out my friend of 17 years had a middle name because I had to scan his passport for something. 
If he had to do stuff where there was paperwork eg bills, leases, insurance et where your name was on it, he probably would know.
But he doesn't. 
So if this is the only detail he doesn't know about you, let it go. He probably doesn't have a brain tumor or anything."
Low self esteem and he sounds manipulative. He may want to think about therapy to address his insecurities and figure out how to view himself  better.
"This may sound wrong but seems like he's getting off on it. Every time you indulge his moments, he will continue creating that tableau of despairing hubby and comforting GF. "

You met her a week ago and she wants your phone pass code? Run. 
Bail for sure man. 
“That’s between you and Dad.”
"I’m sorry I just can’t deal with this. You asked if he wanted a stranger to take care of the kids but that’s what strangers do-request payment for looking after the next person’s kids. You’re acting like a stranger. If you can’t handle being a SAHM it might be time for you to get a job and out the kids in daycare. What about moms who do both? Cook, clean, raise their children, and work. Should they be compensated too? The entire point of being a SAHM is to not work so that you can raise your children and even save money on daycare. This is really bizarre and you honestly owe him a huge apology at very least. "
How the hell do you go 6 months without even WONDERING what his last name is??? How bizarre and weird. 
"It does, it is just less common.   Often it takes something else happening to spark a schizoaffective disorder later in life, like a bump to the head or a stroke or drug use."
"I don't know if this will work for you, but what I do is I think of THE WORST thing that could happen, the one that I am most afraid of (e.g. being homeless and starving, or failing the class completely and having to drop out of school). Then I come up with a strategy of what I'd do in that situation to manage it (e.g. I'd gather the money to go visit family/friends who could help support me, and in the meantime I'd find a homeless shelter or at least a nice bench to sleep on, and I'd visit food banks. Or I'd go home and cry over dropping out and then I'd talk to the school about my options for repeating, or alternative pathways to get my degree, or how to use what I had already completed for some other degree). 

Then once I know I could find a way to manage the worst scenario (even if it would suck), then I know I can trust myself to manage the less-bad scenarios too. They might suck, I might be overwhelmed and scared, but I'll still survive and find a way through it. For me that is usually enough to stop panicking SO badly and start to come up with strategies and ideas that I could do instead. "
"I’m sorry, but I disagree with your advice, at least until she can identify where the jealousy feelings are coming from and how she actually feels about the situation. It can only bring insecurity and confusion to tell your partner “I have these feelings but I don’t know what they are and where they are coming from”... you are right, she will feel better, but it’s a temporary relief of dumping and projecting these feelings onto him... introspection first I believe is a better choice. I’ve done this too (talking before thinking about it) and all it brought was her feeling insecure, distancing from her friend and me ultimately feeling guilty for breaking up a friendship while nothing was going on..."
"Oof. I've never cheated but after my ex and I broke up I brought her swimsuit that she never took back with me to college to use the bikini top as a costume piece with a grass skirt for a halloween thing. Put it in my misc drawer and forgot about it for a few years. Fast forward to my senior year of college and it was still in said drawer when girlfriend found it and had this long accusing me of cheating thing. Anyways I almost lost my gf over nothing. It didn't look good but I was eventually able to convince that nothint had happened after roomates alibies, offering to send pictures to my ex to confirm it was hers, comparing pictures of my ex in other swimsuits to that one, offenring to talk to mom about remembering said swimsuit, letting her go through my phone, etc. It was a really shitty spot to have been in. If you're reading this and have any women's clothing anywhere for any reason, even if you're single: get rid of it. Learn from my mistake. You'll forget about it in some drawer and have a reallllyyyy awkward confrontation and might even lose that special someone should she prove less understanding. "
"I’m sorry you had that experience; honestly, it really sucked for me too and I know what you mean about not telling people. When I read OP’s post, that’s what it reminded me of, I never even thought of a brain tumor or some organic issue because I just assumed her boyfriend was like mine and that is 110% not a healthy assumption."
Tell your mom! That's super weird... I dont know what else to say besides that. 
"The next time he asks your opinion on this, *shut him down*. Don't indulge that conversation, it only feeds his insecurity."
"According to your edit, it's very possible he never actually KNEW your first name even had another syllable at the end of all your social media and everyone you know calls you that.  The last name...has it never come up in conversation?  Do you remember actually telling him your last name?

&amp;#x200B;

How did you meet?  Through friends?  I am terrible at birthdays...I've been with my husband 4 years and get it one day off regularly.  I still get my mom, best friend and grandma's mixed up because they are all in M months and have a 7 in them.  Some people suck at dates."
"Meh, my dad went through a personality overhaul. Started being really grumpy and short tempered. Mom found out he had reached out to an old gf from high school (25-30 years before, had not kept up with her at all).... other smaller personality changes, generally listless about things he once enjoyed, moderately forgetful, etc.... a few months later he had a fall down stairs and the doctor decided to check him out just to be safe. Turns out he two brain tumors, one the size of a golf ball, growing on his motor cord. No physical symptoms at all. 

It seems rare till it happens to you/someone you know, I guess. "
"Except he held up his charming facade for so long, and once it dropped, it dropped. Psychotic people can't do that. "
When I am dating someone I save their full name and birthday in my contacts as soon as I learn so I don’t forget.
"Because they ring and ring and ring and the animals go insane. If I don't open the door, the call my boyfriend (not me) to check if I'm ok. If he can't pick up, they can ring for hours. If he tells them I'm probably not home, they ring again just in case. And they don't stay long, 90% of the time they don't even come in. It better to get it over and done with than hear the doorbell all day. I'm definitely disabling the doorbell."
"If he had told you he was going out with his friends, would you take it well or would you give him a hard time? Have you given him a hard time about this in the past? Be honest."
"This was the first thing I thought of, especially if he's not usually scatterbrained. "
"I constantly wonder if i've got ADD. My focus and attention is horrific, I leave things to the last minute and if there isn't a deadline i'll never get it done in my own time. I forget names but in general i wouldn't say i'm forgetful, i usually forget that i'll be hanging out with friends but i won't miss an appointment. I get super restless really quickly and easily when others seem to be able to sit still just fine. gah idk"
"It sounds like your brother has a drug problem. It's up to your parents to deal with it, you can definitely seek therapy and suggest that they do an intervention but ultimately all you can really do is remove his access to you and your things. Don't keep cash in your room any more. "
Tell someone before she does. That is an invasion of your privacy
"OP, look up **""GASLIGHTING IN RELATIONSHIPS""**

He is gaslighting you. It's a form of abuse.

From the wiki: 
&gt;Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the victim and delegitimize the victim's belief.

It's so easy to not see this while you are in it. Trust me, I've experienced it. You need to cut all ties with this person. He's toxic. Good luck, OP.  "
It must be nice to be so beautiful that people will date you no matter how shit your brain is.
"People that are late are really saying their time is more important than yours, fuck them."
mmm... I'll just say it's been a struggle to find a solution for me. Thank you for your concern. 
"I have, she knows about all of my ocd triggers and such."
"Does he have an actual, on-paper business plan?  If not, he needs one.  He's being delusional if he thinks he can make a go of it without doing sales.  I would tell him that you're frustrated carrying so much financial burden when he won't get out and actually SELL his product.  Point him to resources for a proper business plan and get him to go a financial planning meeting with the bank.  That way, a third party can tell him he's being delusional and give him some tips.  

&amp;#x200B;

Source:  Own a business with my husband and had to teach him how to do a business plan/actually put his words into actions.  He gets it now, it's possible...but you've gotta be insistent."
"Holy crap that sounds terrible. Regardless of his issues, you have a right to have fun too. "
"You married a person  you were attracted to and had children. You’re in pretty deep. I suggest before a lawyer you talk to a mental health professional about your wife’s behavior and your marriage. You will find many support groups. I suspect your wife is crying out for help and you may be only one that can help!

I can relay to you that my marriage was similar to yours. 20 years and three children we discovered she was manic bipolar. Life wasn’t pleasant and had I known 30 years ago what I’ve have learned, I could have effected some positive change. My children have told me their gratitude we didn’t divorce. They knew the lives of friends from divorced households and their lives weren’t so bad. 

It isn’t easy but try the knowledge route. See what you can find out. Your partner and your children may be very thankful for your efforts in the end. A priest once told me marriage wasn’t  for the faint of heart. I now know exactly what he meant. "
No worries! Hope you two have a wonderful Valentine's Day and a very long happy life together.

"&gt; I that common?

Yes.  Abusers believe that they are fine as they are and that the problem is everyone around them.  Also?  Surgeons don't have a reputation for arrogance for no reason whatsoever.

&gt; And if so is there a way to overcome it?

No.  If there were, *then why is abuse still a thing?*  Think about it.

&gt; there has to be something we can collectively do to help him fix his problem.

Just because you want to believe doesn't make it so.  There is nothing you can do.  At all.  He decides to admit to himself that he is abusive and spend the time and energy in therapy grappling with his problems (which abusers just don't do) or...well, that's it.

&gt; It's not as though everyday is bad, over 2 years, there have only been three incidents

One rape and one attempted murder.  The third incident may or may not have been a deliberate physical assault.  You realize that this adds up to years in prison, yes?  These aren't ""little things."""
Less them 50% of people with Lyme show the bullseye rash! Most symptoms are like cold/flu. It is known as the great imitator. CDC at one point ( not sure if they still are) was working on classifying it as an STD due to a relationship to syphilis. To get proper diagnosis request the ELISA titers which are 2  blood tests (you need both) to confirm.
Believe what? The patient in this scenario does not believe they have any clinical issues. We can't just order every test for every patient. I'm also in the UK where there is no bill.
"""SIL, the way you behaved at the wedding and toward my mother was unacceptable. I don't feel comfortable having a close friendship with you going forward. I understand you'll be upset by this, but I hope we can both be polite during family gatherings. Best of luck.""

It's good your husband is understanding about all this. You should still sit down with him and clarify what you'll find acceptable when he wants to support her. If she wants to borrow money, what amount are you comfortable with? If she wants his time for emotional support, how much time can he give her before you get resentful? That sort of thing."
Is he on medication? My medication makes me not be able to retain much short term memory wise. Like I'll be talking and I stop mid sentence because I actually forgot what I was in the middle of saying and a lot of the time I forget words so I have to use a roundabout way to describe stuff because I forget the word I'd use.
This is called dodging a bullet. 
"But you lived the dream. At least for a while. Many guys don’t come even close. She is moving on. Good luck with the fallout. Less begging [to her] will make you a stronger man. We’ve all been there, if it helps. And those, who haven’t? They didn’t live a life."
"I understand how you feel. I have felt what you’re feeling. My boyfriend and I split up for a few months and both saw other people. Even though it’s hypocritical, I felt a lot of the same things you feel. 

I think the biggest thing is to understand that you don’t own someone. This is a person who has their own life and is choosing to spent some of it with you. Those guys didn’t sleep with your girlfriend. They slept with your ex. She didn’t cheat on you or mislead you or lie. She rebounded after a breakup. She literally has options in the palm of her hand but she is choosing YOU. She doesn’t have the fear of “what if I can’t get anyone else?” She can at the touch of a button and still doesn’t that it over a relationship with you. Do you see how powerful that connection is? Not to mention she’s very honest. Do you know how many people are in this situation but just lie to their S/O? She sounds like a very upfront person which is a great quality.

Ultimately it’s just sex. You’re attaching meaning that was not there for her. Meaningless sex is really just that. I’ve had it and wanted nothing more than to be back with the person I loved. Don’t lose someone who you care about over something they did while single. 

"
"Uremic encephalopathy, if anything"
I’ll pitch this 
I'm having a problem with this. You two don't share any social media? What's your name in his contacts? What does he call you on a daily basis? Has he introduced you to his family? 
I have to support this. The way he said he knows it but just can’t remember... it’s probably freaking him out too. 
"I can't believe I had to scroll so far to find a comment like this! Kinda surprised everyone thinks it's a brain tumor or whatever - OP doesn't even go by her first name! Also forgetting exact birthdays is very normal, even in very long term relationships. "
"I hate to say it but you don't have a grandparent problem- you have a boyfriend problem.  

You may have been lax about setting reasonable boundaries yourself but it has to be a *joint* effort.  If he can't or won't enforce those mutually agreed boundaries, it won't get better.  Or worse, you'll end up demonized as the evil witch that has taken away their grandson.

Work out specific times/dates he goes to visit or you're open for guests.  Refuse to engage anytime else.  The suggestions for doorbells etc. might help here.  Heck, use pen and paper to circumvent the select deafness.

You don't deserve being held hostage in your own home.  Your boyfriend needs to hold firm."
"My take on this is when she’s gotten to the bar and she maybe thought her previous response was a bit short as she was still upset and was messaging you to move pass it and open up the conversation again. The fact she is sending the pictures and videos to other people as well shows she wasn’t trying to upset you and was jus having a good time and possibly trying to entice people to join them. Your reaction of blocking her was an over reaction and is no doubt why she is now upset, changed the passwords and doesn’t want to talk to you. You should probably sit down with her in person and get everything out in the open. It’s probably an idea to at least give her a few hours to cool down before messaging her to make a time to talk. I would also suggest that you go to therapy as it sounds like you have issues from your childhood that you need to get on top off. "
The whole scenario is a Seinfeld episode.
"I think this is bad advice. The problem in your case was that she didn’t love you the same way (as you said). Not that she had sex with people while you were broken up. OP said she was loyal and alluded to him being the one that messed up and end things. Expecting someone who you aren’t in a relationship with, and who you don’t expect to work things out with, to ‘hold out’ for you isn’t loyalty, it’s possession. She’s giving him another chance and trusting him again. That’s the real loyalty. "
"Damn!  Welp, the information that people posted still stands and will of use to others.

Over/under on when this post is either locked or deleted?"

"...what?!

I don’t even know what to say to this. It’s completely insane."

I agree. I don’t get why he involved our families in this charade. He just had me call his dad last week to wish him a HBD. He was calling my brothers to try to build a relationship. Why involve the families? It’s just so mean.
"Best thing you can do is just be quiet, stop talking, and listen, really listen to what he’s saying. 

He is stressed the F out, clearly. Crying on the phone is only making that worse. I understand - and I’m sure he understands - that your INTENTIONS are good; but there’s a place and a time to be supportive, and a place and a time to back off and leave him alone. 

Men and women process emotions differently. You want to talk, and express yourself, and be empathetic. That’s wonderful, and we need as much of you in the world as we can get. But it can also be extremely smothering and repressive, like a super heavy blanket. 

The best thing you can do for him is to say “okay, I’m sorry you’re going through such a hard time. If you need peace and quiet to sort some things out, that’s fine. I’ll be here if you need me. I love you, and remember that this too will pass and you’ll be okay again.”

Then, don’t contact him. Let him contact you. You’re going to worry like hell, but try not to. Sometimes we men just need to work some shit out on our own. I get like that from time to time, where I don’t want ANYONE to bother me at all, and I become really annoyed by even the mundane and trivial. 

Breathe. It’ll be alright. Just take a step back and focus on yourself for a bit. "
"If this is something you don't think you can get over then there's no point in trying. But if you really wanna get past this then lurking on her social media isn't going to help. If he can switch departments or something, that would be ideal. As long as they're in the same environment then it's gonna be hard. "
"""Choosing your career"" doesn't mean all the conclusions you jumped to. I'm guessing you freelance and that's why you work so much. I'm guessing you feel like you can't turn down work, that you have to put all your free time into your career, and you have to put 100% into every project you take on. Either way, with 60-80 hours of work per week, something has to give. It is clear how much you value your marriage. You're even forcing yourself to work out to the point of exhaustion just to spend time with her. There has to be a better way.

You have to make the decision to cut back on work if you want to improve your marriage. I would offer your wife similar advice if she were asking, but you're the one writing to us. Have you sat her down and tried to talk to her seriously about your feelings? Do you think she wishes for the same things you do? Does she know you miss spending quality time with her? If you agree that you both want that, I think you will both find ways to make it work, but you have to make time in your schedule before you can ask her to do the same. I hope you can go into this conversation with the recognition that both of you need to make time for your marriage, and that her time is not less valuable than hers just because you choose to spend all your time working and she makes time for a passion that makes her happy."
"Thanks for your input! It just that its sucks because we have an otherwise amazing relationship.. I personally had an amazing dad with who I have so many memories etc and even if the bar is set high, I don't want to give them less than what I had if that makes sense.."
"I was thinking the exact same thing. You don't just start talking like this one day from another.

OP, I strongly urge you to tell your boyfriend that he should see a neurologist ASAP. This could be a dumb prank or this could be something medically serious."

"It's cool, I typed that and then went to lunch, so I guess it's my fault?  I didn't see any replies to my comment until everyone was already mad at me, lol."
"So he's ""thinking about being with you"" every day, yet letting his GF go along blissfully ignorant that there's a problem? That's the kind of guy you want, one who won't work with you or communicate when there's a problem, just let you think everything's great until he's got your replacement lined up? It's emotional cheating. 

Look, there's no insurmountable obstacle keeping you two apart. If he wanted to be with you, he'd be with you. If he didn't want to be with his GF, he wouldn't be with her. He's either lying to you about his feelings for you, hoping to get some side-action or lining you up as a backup plan, or he's lying to his GF, or (most probably) lying to both of you.  Look, you don't want him to leave his GF for you. You'd always wonder if he'll do the same to you. The fact that their relationship is shitty doesn't make it okay to cheat. You want to tell yourself that this is different, it's just that your love for each other is so special and unstoppable. But that's a lie. Cheaters cheat because they're cheaters, not because of Very Special Love that cannot be denied. I mean, if his love for you was that grand, why has not he not broken up with his GF? To avoid hurting her? Isn't he hurting her more by robbing her of the chance to find some non-cheater who fully reciprocates her feelings in a way that he doesn't? "
"It's not about right or wrong, it's about a difference in opinion on dogs. Personally, I think your mom needs to learn to leave the house without her dog so that she can come to your house and relax for a while. Many, many people don't let 'not their dog' into their house."
Should have mentioned.

"Completely from an outsiders point of view, it sounds like this might mostly be in your head?

You can’t really pinpoint a lot of behavior that indicates they don’t like you, and you explain away behavior that implies they do like you.

Like: You say they’re nice to you, but call it “overly” nice and that it feels fake?

Or you say that you get the feeling they don’t want to talk to you, but then one of the girls is always excited to see you and calls you over?

I might be wrong, of course, since I’m only getting a small glimpse of the situation.

No matter what: you’re going to be sharing a room together, so it’s absolutely worth it to try and change this dynamic.

Invite them to stuff. Ask them if they want to get coffee after class. If you’ve been gone from the group a while and you’ve turned down a few invitations, they might think *you’re* the one who doesn’t want to be friends with *them*. 
"
"In general I would have given her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she didn't want to ""bother"" you while you were in the hospital, maybe she had a lot on her own plate, etc. but coupled with her ghosting you in the past i'd say that maybe she's not the kind of friend you thought she was.  If you feel like you can't rely on her then don't. Perhaps it's time to invest in your other friendships more and let that one kind of subside.

I hope you have a swift recovery!"
"Unless you are cleaning 24/7 there is no way your house isn’t dirtier than someones house without a pet. Between hair, food and water messes, and toys there is just more to clean and it will never be perfect. I say this as someone who has cats. "
"This makes me really sad but you are right, there is really nothing she could do in .any states."
"Thanks for your input! It just that its sucks because we have an otherwise amazing relationship.. I personally had an amazing dad with who I have so many memories etc and even if the bar is set high, I don't want to give them less than what I had if that makes sense..

His mother however, wouldn't have played even one game of Candyland with him so that's the example he has"
Be thankful he showed this side of himself now and not a wedding and 3 kids later.
Awesome news. All the best to you.
"Sometimes I read r/relationships titles and shout out loud to my phone ""Why the F are you still going out with him??"".
That was one of those times. "
"My girl is a catahoula leopard dog so she's smelly, loud, herds the elderly and young into one room of the house and guards the room, refusing to let anyone out of her sight. That's her nature though the catahoulas arent typically kept as pets so they really are working dogs and have that instinct to keep the herd together and guard. She means well.

My mother in law loves my dog but doesn't want the dog in her house and I don't blame her one bit! "
"He makes up stuff about you being a danger to him. He accuses you of lying. He accuses you of cheating. 'Secretly' takes out his stuff. Doesn't want to spend any time with you anymore. This guy definitely wanted out but lacked the spine to tell you this in a normal way. Instead he sought after any excuse to put the breakup on you. Then you make an angry remark and he goes full drama queen about you betraying his trust blablabla. You were totally in the right to be angry, because he was checking out of the relationship without telling you. I also think it's a very real possibility that he was cheating and was projecting this on you.

All this, or the guy is a complete whacko. Either way, I'd say good riddance."
"Eh I don’t know, I feel like that’s fine at first, but once you’ve gone on multiple dates the nice thing to do is make it clearer how you feel."
He definitely started criticizing me more and making mean jokes at my expense for this last month. I felt unhappy but then he would tell me he is just stressed with work and trying to make a better life for us. And I would second guess my feelings. 
It doesn't matter if he denies it. You don't need his permission to break up. You don't have to prove shit.
"Ok, first of all. Your boyfriend can fuck off with this bullshit double standard he has lol. This isn’t just an insecurity it’s a sense of entitlement that he has when it comes to women. He can check out women and describe in detail the thoughts men have when checking women out about big ass and tits, but you’re not “allowed” to have a man even look your way? What kind of made up world is that where he sees this as an inherent need in men yet it’s somehow the woman’s responsibility to not let it happen when she’s in a relationship? 
This is the attitude and red flag of an abuser, and I am quite sure this behavior will unfortunately escalate as the relationship goes on. Also, needing to be drunk in order to discuss a problem? Red flag #2"
It's not respectful for your mother to bring her dog into your girlfriend's house after your girlfriend made it clear the dog isn't welcome. Your mom is pressuring your gf into letting the dog in the house by bringing it and letting it cry in the garage for hours. 
"Everyone responds to different anxiety coping mechanisms differently. Breathing exercises, distracting yourself, and positive self-talk are common ones I like. My roomie loves ground exercises (focusing really intensely on sensory input for a few minutes) but those aren't my personal go-to. I sometimes like to take 5 minutes (literally set a timer) to find a spot to be alone (bathroom, whatever) and dwell on/write about what I'm feeling, and once the 5 minutes is up, then I throw all my effort into calming down/distracting myself and moving on until I can fully process it later by writing or talking to someone about it. I've been in plenty of therapy for several years now, and I'm presently in a good place mentally, so I've gotten pretty good at redirecting my thoughts once I realize I'm having an anxiety reaction instead of a reasonable emotional response. 

The ""are your feelings based on reality"" check is more to help the person recognize that they're being irrational in the moment. It's sorta up to that person (and their therapist) to figure out how to manage that reaction from there. "
"They should not go snooping like this, I am relieved someone said it."
"And to my gf ""You There"" I leave a pittance."
"I think the thing you're missing here is a sense of scale. Yeah, it's good to be considerate of others' needs. That's just being a good friend. But you don't need to beat yourself up when all you did was cause a mild inconvenience! How would you have known her mom was in the hospital *unless she told you?* Instead, you should try to learn from this: next time a friend hasn't responded to your texts (or whatever the issue is) you will have it in the back of your head that ""hey, maybe they're busy with something crucial right now."" And instead of sending a passive-aggressive text about being ignored, you'd respond with something like ""hey, haven't heard back from you yet, just wanna make sure you saw that text"" or whatever.

Bottom line: you're making this a way bigger deal than it probably is. "
I don’t think I am happy. I just don’t know if I’d be more happy without her. We have been perfectly compatible in the past and I have my own insecurities just not to her level. 
This sounds like you’re making something that’s not about you completely about you. He’s bringing his new girlfriend to a party where his friends work? To.... watch your snap stories? You need to move on

"Oh my god. I think you’ve got to tell your mom, dude.  She was drunk, it’s going to be something she regrets, since you’re family and you say she seems like a decent normal person otherwise.  That’s some serious boundary crossing tho. "
"I thought the last time you posted in relationships, your entire immediate family was giving you a difficult time about your weight?"
"Yes and no. OP admits that she goes by a nickname instead of her real name. It's still a massive blunder that shows a lack of interest in their life, however, I think it's not inconceivable. "
"My boyfriend always picks me up from work. I had a long week and he’s spending the night here. We’re probably just gonna play some video games and enjoy each other’s company.

We literally just spent a good hour tickling each other and shit. We are lame. Lmao"
"Oh, to clarify I never let a patient feel like they shouldn't have come even if I think that's the case. I always take them seriously and do full history and examination as necessary. I worded myself really poorly saying they'd be laughed out of the room."
"Honestly last name isn’t that weird is it? How often do you hear your partners last name - maybe they tell it to you once or twice early on, and that’s it unless it’s in your email or Facebook. And the first name was weird until she says she has a nickname that everyone used. "
Tell her you don't feel 6 weeks is that long. But be prepared; she might just want to break up and is using this as an excuse. 
Thanks for the reply. I have an app that records phone call and a ton of emails and texts with her cursing me to hell. Never wanted to do this but i got tons of evidence if we go to court
"I could see it she is literally always goes by a nick name, as she said. Using her own example, it sounds like her name is Jordan, she goes by Jo, and he said her full first name is Jordana. Not that crazy IMO. "
Get over it - it’s just stuff. 
"I don't want them to think its ok and my older son, 8 year old is already starting to show signs if lashing out in defense. I'm trying to make up for it by showing almost extra love that i feel a mom should show but its still not right and i know it.

 Your right, they do have it hard with her, i do every extra thing put them in private school, spoil them, spend all my time with them i can. I love my kids with all my heart and i feel she attacks me through them sometimes on purpose.

Your all right though, i just needed some internet people to tell me leaving this crazy woman is the right idea cause everyone in real life apparently thinks i and my kids should suffer for the next 20-30 years. Thank you."

"Unless, as some other commenters are suggesting, this is evidence of neurological damage, I'd say this is just a testament to how shockingly easy it is to get by in a friendship or relationship with someone while missing crucial pieces of information like this. 

Still sucks though. One wonders why he wasn't able to find some other, more discreet way of getting this information. "
"He is absolutley cheating on you and probably never stopped. You don't ever have a reason to take off a watch, unless it's to wash hands (MAYBE) , and if it's that then you don't forget to put it back on. You forget to put it back on when it has been off for an extended amount of time and you were...distracted. 

He is also only staying with you for free rent. "
"&gt;Well, most people can tell after 3 years whether the person is abusive or not.

Just thought I'd throw it out there that my partner and I wanted 3 years before moving in. It's a fair/long amount of time to give and it worked for us. I don't see anything wrong with setting that kind of boundary for yourself. "
"Go to the police, now. They may not be able to get a restraining order, but they can definitely give him a call on your behalf. "
"I did a test on this with my facebook friends. The ones who go by nicknames have that set up as their first name. Out of the 9 that have their nicknames as their first names, 2 of them use some shortened version of their last name and one of them use their mothers maiden name and not their legal last nane."
How did they test for that and how did you find out? I've been having weird cognitive problems lately but don't know what to get tested for

"He sounds like he has borderline personality disorder. He love-bombed you in the beginning and then ""split you black"" over literally his imagination. Unlike my ex who went through the love-bomb/split cycle in about 4 weeks - your guy's cycle sounds longer. I know it hurts to be left by someone with BPD because it makes zero sense and feels so unfair - but it's honestly the LESS painful way to go forward. Staying with him will hurt you way worse. Please, please stay away from him. Also, know that he WILL try to suck you back in again once his cycle is over or he realizes you aren't playing his games anymore."
What country do you live in? It seems really strange that you don’t have boundless opportunities. Don’t you go out just to do stuff with friends or go drive to the store?
"I can see how you'd want closure on this, because it's bewildering. But this is just, either abusive or mentally ill behavior, a lot of it, and it's good that you're getting away from this guy so he can work on himself. Most people wouldn't ever put up with this kind of behavior. You deserve a good, mutually-respectful relationship. This might be a good time to sit down with a therapist or good friend and walk through things and figure out where a normal person would have walked away, and why you didn't, and how you can work on being healthier and looking out for yourself. I'm sorry this happened to you but I feel confident you'll look back and see this as a good thing. "
"first, he shouldn’t have a say whether you have social media. unless you’re telling him he can’t have fb or sc either, you should be able to make as many accounts as you want, you’re an adult.

second, it’s absolutely crossing the line for him to yell at you and call you an idiot over a simple mistake that anyone could make. what kind of personal information was it? if it wasn’t his ssn or anything serious like that, he shouldn’t be so mad. people can find your number and address with just a google search, so nothing’s really private anymore

a relationship is all about trust and respect, and if he’s still disrespecting you like this 7 months in you have to drop him or at least warn him that you will no longer accept this kind of treatment."
"You've misunderstood me completely? I'm not saying I have to have a romantic relationship with her, I never said that... I'm saying I only want to be friends with her if she actually cares about our friendship. Nothing to do with romance. I'd feel exactly the same way towards a man. She is already fully aware I have feelings for her. "
Or she could just not go to the party since it's her who has the problem? He was there first.

"Just make sure you text or call her on the days of, and then celebrate together when you can. Or you could have flowers delivered to her on valentines "
i can't imagine this is the first thing that made you weary of this man.
"You're not alone, although it seems so. This feeling happens to many."
Please read the edit. My mom is micromanaging. 
"My husband and I are all about doing little things for one another. Yesterday/today, it really felt like he went the extra mile: he made sure my tires were at the right air pressure, since they usually drop during extremely cold weather; he picked up a light dinner for me before my workout class, since neither of us has time to cook before it; he prepped my coffee for me; and he cleared the snow off of my car this morning before we left for work. He really is the best, and I feel so lucky to be in a relationship with him. "
"It sounds like some of the things you are offering to do could have huge positive effects on this kids life and career. Is it fair for him to miss out on those opportunities because you’re no longer dating his sister? No, of course not. If you’re comfortable enough with talking to this guy, you should for sure let him know you have some people who want to meet him. Let him know it’s his call if he wants to tell his sister or not, but that you aren’t interested in talking to her. "
"There's three possible ways that you can choose to approach this.

1) Treat it as a work of fiction, which it is. Taking ""inspiration"" from a real-life figure is incredibly common for writers, which in this case would involve taking ""bullet point"" notes of things you've done, and then creating an original character with these bullet points as a basis. 

2) Treat it as an insight into how others perceive you, and consider whether you want to take steps to adjust your behaviour - if this character is one where, if someone who knows you read this book, they would immediately say ""oh man you're totally ____"", then the rationales and justifications you've made in each point might not be apparent to other people.

3) Treat it as an insult and drop this friend from your life.

Without more context I can't say which of these scenarios are most likely, you will know best how your friend treats you and how they generally write their books. That said, this might be an opportunity for some introspection anyways - you've said this character is ""clearly an asshole"", but with every example you describe, you follow it up with ""well yes this is me *but*"" - if the way you act in the world is concordant with this character, other people don't have the benefits of your internal rationalizations, so there's a risk that others are perceiving you the way that you perceive this character. "
You need to move on dude. She's dating someone else and is telling you with her actions that she's not comfortable being your close friend. 
I think think this is the best way to never having to worry about your self respect or privacy in the future. 
"I'm more confused with why you're so hung up on whether or not penetration happened. Why is that the line, and why are you more concerned with whether or not that's the truth of what happened? It seems to me that there are more important things you should worry about here, which is that they definitely fooled around (regardless of whether actual PIV happened or not), and do you care about that? Would how you feel about it change if PIV did happen (and if so, man, why?)?  


I get that you're doubtful about who to trust, and my gut instinct would say trust whoever you've known longer (which I assume is your friend), but keep in mind that she could be talking the truth regardless about it being a one-off thing and that she genuinely wants to be with you. I'm just genuinely confused why this ""but did you get the D"" is so important, honestly."
"You you're happy with her but want to fuck other people...

That's not how that works. "
If you end up dead the apology will not matter.
That's called the honeymoon stage - it's always the third stage in the cycle of abuse with abusive men.  It's where they apologize and make you feel bad for them and claims to see the error of their ways and justifies both the behavior and why they'll never do it again in a million different ways.  Then the tension starts building again and then they choke you again and then they apologize again.
You should trust your friend who told you first. 
Sorry but the title made me lol 😂 
"Uhhhh, possible psychotic break? He's not much older than the typical age severe mental illness rears its head."
Yep.  She's showing you how you look to other people.  It may or may not be intentional but... don't dish out what you can't take in return.
"Sounds like they have an accurate depiction of you. As far as what you should say, you can be honest with her and tell her it hurt your feelings but then you’d have to be honest with yourself and ask *why* did it hurt your feelings. You don’t want that probably so go with option B: don’t saying anything at all unless your opinion is asked. Your opinion is not required here so the simple reality is that giving it is not a pressing issue. As far as your relationship with this friend you can either take this as a hint that they want you to change or take it as a slight and just stop associating with this person. But more than anything it seems like this has hurt your ego and maybe you just need to ask her if there is currently a problem she’s having with you that you might not be aware of."

Sugar. Daddy. Even if just for friendship. Nothing wrong with that
"I seriously don't understand all these responses. He owns half the house, why is her opinion of not wanting a dog in the house more valid than his? Also it's not fair to leave the dog outside or locked in the garage. Even if the dog did pee in the house, there are so many products that remove smells and stains! We're talking about a dog, not a cat (which is more amonia based). Is the house mostly carpet and that's her concern? It sounds like the dog is also small and any pee would be so easy to clean up. Honestly it sounds like she just hates dogs and is using the dog peeing as an excuse. I might be more understanding if she didnt know the dog or if the dog was a mess but it doesn't sound like it is. Regardless, it seems a little inconsiderate of her in this specific case. You're not asking to get a dog, you're asking to allow your mom's well behaved dog into the house twice a year. "
"&gt;why did he take off his watch?

So he has a good reason to go back later and pick it up...from her nightstand."

"Yea man I needed to hear that, it’s not that bad I just need to move forward with my life.

Soooo you give real life examples from your own life for the bad traits and you are asking yourself the character based on you has those traits? Like you really explained it yourself already.

"&gt; Why do you not address paying more for rent for a 100% time garage space?

Well...I would, if that's what I wanted.  I don't think I've said that's what I'm looking for, in any of these posts.  Last year, we shared time in the 1 usable stall.  This year, with new doors, there are 2 usable stalls.  We agreed to continue sharing time in the same stall we shared last winter.  Last week she retracted that agreement, and I have no access to either stall.  I believe that if the shoe was on the other foot, I would give her one full-time.  But I have not *asked her* for that - I asked only to continue sharing 1 of the 2. She does not wish to do that any more.

&gt; What did you do winter of 17-18???

Last year, there was 1 usable stall (there are 2 stalls with separate doors, but one wasn't accessible, because its door didn't work.  There are new doors this year).  We divided time in the one usable stall, which was fine.  That seemed to be the most viable solution.  There was no friction about it that I'm aware of.

&gt; You made it a point to say that where you live there is snow on the ground 6 months out of the year......so....why did you buy a vehicle like this? Knowing you don't have access to a garage 100% of the time?

I bought it when I owned my own house, and did not expect to divorce.  When that happened, I moved to the apartment, which had a garage stall.  Then when I moved in with her at the end of 2017, we divided time in the one stall.  My concern isn't so much about the car itself - I do have some stress about repair costs, but you're right, that's my choice and my issue - so much as it is about asking having the shared access withdrawn, even though we had done that last year, agreed to do it again this year.  I do not blame her for wanting to treat her cars gently.  My frustration is from having that shared access cut off completely.  It feels like she does not view the relationship as a partnership.  There are a lot of moving parts I suppose.

&gt; My point is....there are to many uncertainties in your post that don't really need to be there, and that makes me question how honest you are being. I'm not saying you are wrong, I just don't believe that this is the whole story.

I believe I've been consistent throughout - but fair enough.  I was vague on specific dates and months when they weren't really material to the story, because I am also concerned about personal details online.  But apparently that has led to confusion.

And while I would like to be as fair in the storytelling as possible - you are right to take it all with a grain of salt.  Unconscious bias and slanting is human nature.  We all see things from our perspective.  "

Im sure she feels the same...
"I would agree, but sis doesn't have honest intentions, here. She's not protecting anything, she's just being obstinate. It sounds like OP's family has a family history of treating her like shit."
"Ah, fair enough, that's a much better place to be approaching it from!  Since it sounds like it's something you'd like to try, I'll add another piece of advice - jealousy is a secondary emotional.  It happens due to a mix of primary emotions, and those base causes aren't always the same.  Fear of loss, anger at missing something, anxiety about being replaced, sadness over not feeling good enough, etc.  If jealously is an issue, instead of just focusing on the obvious cause (""you did something fun with someone else!"") Try to dig deeper into why and address that (""you going out with him/her made me realize we don't have many dates anymore.  I am scared that I'm a comfortable safety blanket, not someone you are exploring life with.  Let's plan something fun together for next weekend!"").  "

&amp;#x200B;

problem is he works with her, so i assume he will see her every day.  That's very difficult for him to just drastically change his behavior.  You have no idea what their behavior like is to each other at work"
"It does sound premeditated. This is unfortunate because if she only discussed it with you further it sounds like you might have been into it. You two need to work on your communication.  She is really bad at it.   If you really want to find out if they’ve fucked before you can as him if she was as good as he remembered.  It does sound like she just wanted to get into swinging and this was a push she felt you needed. I mean she could cheat on you anytime behind your back but she instead chose to involve you.

So when I said ""it sounds more like you want him to be there for you"" I was 100% on the money.

You can't pretend to me there for someone while everything you say indicates you are concerned with only yourself. It's worse than ignoring him. This is why your boyfriend has to get away from you."
Sounds like her portrayal is pretty accurate.  
"I had an issue at university once like this except my scenario was not even as bad as yours! And my friends were very worried for me. This is how I handled it, and it worked like a charm, and I have recommended this method to my other 2 friends who had this situation. 

Next time he contacts you, send him a message. It has to be something that is typed out so you have proof. Tell him “this is my formal request that you have no contact with me. This is a warning that if you contact me after this message, then I will go directly to the police. I only need a response that says you received this message.” 


My friends joke that I basically made my own “restraining order”. But this worked right away for me. However, YMMV! Good luck and I hope this ends soon!"
"Do you communicate? Like really, deeply talk to each other? It sounds like you're both resentful, you spend time on your phones in front of each other instead of talking, and you want to physically be with her for more time but it doesn't sound like there would be talking involved (at least on your part, it must be tough to climb those mountains and I'm sure not all pass the talk test!).

&amp;#x200B;

When people are talking about date nights, they mean time to get away from the routine a bit and to sit, face to face, and share in each other's lives. The ""thing"" is not as important, like the picnic, restaurant, park, destination, etc. The date is a time to spend together and get to know each other (again).

&amp;#x200B;

Don't try to match her. Don't try to compete with her. You don't need to do everything with her. (I'm not saying you can't do these things, but that you shouldn't try to be keeping up all the time - and I say this as a very competitive person) I think you're feeling a lot of pressure from a lot of different sides, and maybe she is too. But it's not bringing you closer together as you feel that you're shouldering this on your own. You may find that she shares some of the same worries but is coping with it differently."

Have her read the stuff on that subreddit.
"You can almost ALWAYS go by the saying ""Once a cheater, always a cheater.""    

Are there rare cases where people really change?  Yes, but he has shown none of those signs.  
- He has shown no real remorse or regret. 
- He ""has been dishonest on multiple occasions"" so really, no commitment to being honest going forward.
- He doesn't respect your feelings or try to make you feel more secure (""basically glosses over it or just denies knowing the things were around"")

So, yeah. I know he feels like someone special but he's not.  Get away from this cheater before you waste any more time on him.   You're young -- you will meet many, many more people and deserve someone who makes you a priority. "
"&gt; What shall I say to her?

Nothing? 

&gt; Why are you writing this crap?

Why do you care? It's fictional writing. It's a character. "
"You’re so lucky he dumped you! He sounds like an asshole who’s going to regret this decision down the road. Seriously it’s good he dumped you because now you don’t have to miss his lying immature ass. He could have been cheating, but even if he thought you were, you gave him enough evidence that you weren’t, and he still acted that way because he was still angry with no one to take it out on so he created lies to make you look bad so he could feel better about himself by putting you down. Work on yourself, and when he’s creeping you months from now to maybe try and get you back (guys like that don’t have much luck in relationships) he’ll see you’re way better off and instantly get mad at himself again, but this time he won’t be able to take it out on you! 

Stay mad and never go back, good luck op and you clearly deserve way better! "
This is too cryptic to understand.
"I don't want to be a huge bummer for you, but if you've only just been diagnosed with BPD, you might want to consider staying out of a relationship for a little while until you've been through a full round of DBT. 

As you know, your condition makes relationships really difficult, and it would be better to go into one armed with all of the tools that you'll need as opposed to trying to figure it out as you go.

All that said, I would give all of this information to your ex *immediately* so that he knows what you're dealing with and he knows what he's getting into. It's important for him to know that you're at the very beginning of an intense mental health journey and that it's going to be a bit of a roller coaster ride. He should make an informed decision on whether he wants to go on that ride."
Agree. School HRs and admin do not do anything to help people who are getting harassed. Call cops and escalate NOW before he shows up in your house. 
"He's harassing you and stalking you. You are not overreacting. Take screenshots and document as best you can. Contact your counselor at school and then know what is going on and how he won't leave you alone. 

Document EVERYTHING and write everything down. But more importantly be safe. 

I think you should send one more message to him and say that if he continues to contact you and harass you that you will bring this to the authorities. Be clear and say that any more contact will be considered harassment. "
"I think how soon you tell him depends on if you think what you've been diagnosed with relates to why the relationship ended. If you think it does relate to why the relationship ended, it would probably offer clarity to him to know soon. Either way, I think that he deserves to know before you're officially in a relationship together again. He will also need time to process it. Good luck! "
You are not overreacting. Go to the police and the school.

"7months is waaaayy too early to start living with someone, especially since it’s a long distance relationship. I think wanting to live in students housing is perfectly reasonable.  Also he sounds like a bit of a deadbeat tbh, and you don’t sound like you have much faith in him. I would think twice about this relationship "
"This is true. My mother and I were very close and he would do things like buy me a present just because and tell me since my mom used to buy me presents all the time just because, he wants to exist in that space for me now. "

"Maybe slightly unethical, but it's really easy to lie to people if they think you're a bad liar! If you get called out for this and you lie, and you get anxious/cry, use it! You can say you're anxious and crying because you're scared a rumor is floating around about you. 

Please note this isn't me telling you you need to lie, but if that's the route you want to go, you can definitely make it work! "
"First off, stop cleaning. You are not a doormat and don’t let them treat you like one.

Second. I’d be making the bedroom storage 50/50. Take stuff out of the closet until it’s 50% free, dump the extra on her bed, same with the dresser. Yeah it’s petty, but you’re paying for half the room too.

Third. Don’t take the ridicule. You’re an adult, you don’t need to put up with this bullshit. You don’t need these people as friends.

Just remember that this is a tiny blip in time and when you’re done school none of those people will matter at all. Keep your head held high, be confident, demand respect."
"He needs therapy &amp; maybe treatment for the booze. He needs to get those things without you around because he is emotionally abusing you, and there's no reason for you to be his verbal punching bag. "
"Sorry this is really hard to comment on because it's very cryptic.  What kind of thing did he assume?  Why did it cause him to lie?  What kinds of lies were they?

Like if he assumed you were a vegetarian and lied about loving steak, not a huge deal.  If he assume you were a vegetarian and lied about putting steak in meals he made for you repeatedly, bigger deal."
"Same story, we were messing around one afternoon and something didn't go the way he wanted it to so he accused me of having recently had sex with someone else, out of the clear blue sky. It was baffling. A few months later, he told me he got hammered drunk right around that time and slept at a mutual girl friend's house. Then he confessed he slept in her bed. He insisted nothing happened, but he was distinctly accusatory before that and apologized all over himself for doing it (I don't think I'd have cared a whole lot if it was just passed out sleep but the way he behaved told me that's not all there was to it). 

We ran into that same girl at a party weeks later and she completely ignored both of us. Definitely not just sleep. Dodged bullet, he was the damn devil."
"Don't have kids with this woman, and don't buy a house with her. This isn't going to last, and you are going to want a clean easy way out."
if she can't accept the real you then why do you want to be her friend ?
"You sound like you have depression pretty bad. Being completely unmotivated to do anything is a major symptom. 

For most people, the ""good reason"" for choosing things to do is that it makes their family happy. Your relationship, your family, and your wife should be all the ""good reasons"" you need to shape up. 

If you can't motivate yourself, you really do need to see a therapist to get to the root of this problem."
My mom is respectful so she doesnt say anything. But that doesnt mean shes not upset about it. 
"Having a nice open conversation with your gf is the way, man. as they say, communication is key.

  Don't be afraid to voice your concerns. Just be easygoing and respectful about it. I wish you luck"
Honestly talking about how you feel with her is the best thing you can do.  Open communication is the best thing that you can do for a relationship. 
"Look up compromise, see what it means. Or explain to me what is the compromise on your side if she fully caves to this demand."

Ahh yes I see I misread. Sorry about that.

So it really had nothing to do with the joke, the conflict was in the way the argument escalated? I'm guessing you both are to blame for that?"

"This comes across as unnecessary patronizing. You don't know where OP is or what the local attitude about homosexuality is. It could be anywhere from unpleasant to downright dangerous if OP's sexuality gets out. It sounds like his parents would disown them if they knew, and it also sounds like he's currently relying on them for education and housing. Your advice offers no practical solutions and is dismissive of his situation because you seem to think anyone under 30 can't have real problems. Besides, even if life is harder down the road, even if this ends up being fine, OP is a young adult and this might actually be the most serious problem he's ever faced simply because he hasn't had the life experience to have more difficult problems. It's no reason to blow it off in a forum designed for real advice."

"Happy for you, it just goes up from here 🙂"
"&gt;He assumed something probably from the beginning, and it was a wrong assumption. This led him to lie about some stuff, which was totally unnecessary cause I didn't give a shit about this thing.

Honestly, my first though was ""well why are you giving such a shit, now?"".

People aren't perfect.

If he did something that lead to causing your emotional, mental or physical pain or lied about his drug abuse or pedophilia, I can see being upset.

This? IMO, this is just looking for a reason to dump him.

Which makes me think you need to be more honest with yourself about the relationship.

If you want it, forgive the guy and LET IT GO.

If not, break up and go on your way.

Don't stick around the 5 years. He doesn't want to have kids and also doesn't want to lose you so his grand plan is to avoid admitting it in hopes you'll change your mind. 
"You were re-defining *upgrades* to the home since it was just a door. And now you are backpedaling.

You sharing the spot is something that you definitely need to discuss.  I mean...don't shovel for her if she's being like that.  But I'm confused since *that is not your argument.*  You want to use the second spot and move the son's car.  

&gt;I've always kept it in a garage, 

But this isn't true.  What did you do winter of 17-18???

Again...what did you do 17-18?  What about salt?  You made it a point to say that where you live there is snow on the ground 6 months out of the year......so....why did you buy a vehicle like this?  Knowing you don't have access to a garage 100% of the time?

And your dating timeline doesn't really add up.  Seems like you guys might have rushed this relationship a tad.  I can see why she's leery....you also dodge all the commitment/future stuff.  So my guess is you both have alot of baggage in that department.

My point is....there are to many uncertainties in your post that don't really need to be there, and that makes me question how honest you are being.  I'm not saying you are wrong, I just don't believe that this is the whole story."
Thank you! That is really good advice :)
"I started suffering from anxiety and panic attacks about 3 years ago. At first it was very very scary and confusing. It was just a nightmare. I just couldn't for the love of god figure out what's wrong with me. I tried so many different things and it took me about year and a half to start therapy and another year to be diagnosed with OCD which is a severe anxiety disorder. With CBT and Ssri i managed to get a grip on my compulsive thinking and things gradually improved. The worst thing was not knowing what is wrong with me. When I figured that out it became easier to treat.
Too tell you the truth, i really kept things bottled up and tried to fake everything fine. I tried to minimize the damage to our marriage but I couldn't go out and have fun and i was rather gloomy. 
Things really improved when i started treatment and i am much more social and happy. Its just so sad that it couldn't be sooner and maybe things wouldn't get to this point she left me."

"I think it's never a good idea to try and build a friendship with someone that you actually have feelings for- no matter the reason, she's pulled back and I think you should just let her go for the time being. If you want more, and clearly you do, it will be painful to you and unfair to her to pretend you are okay with just being friends while harboring feelings. Even though you may try your hardest to simply be her friend, you are hung up on her and there will probably be a good part of you hoping that one day that spark will come back. So back off, let her take the lead with communication (you can of course continue to be friendly), and see where where she goes with it. In the meantime, distract yourself with activities, friends, and look for other dating possibilities. "

"He likes the idea of reproducing with you, but I don't think he wants kids. It's a delicate topic. I kind of 'touch' the subject by being like: I saw this kind of kid/parent today, I would do it totally different. Or: I saw some great parenting today. That's how I know that my partner doesn't just like the idea, but is invested in our future offspring."
Doesn't sound like he would be a great dad.  He's too cool to take his hypothetical kid to a zoo? Zoo's are awesome.  I would start to talk to him about what his ideal future looks like in terms of family.  See if you guys are on the same page at all.

You don't have to suggest that he needs professional help, frankly that's not your problem. Your problem is that he isn't leaving you alone, and that's the goal here. If he insists on contacting you after that, a single warning that you will alert the police if he doesn't stop reaching out. And then actually do."
"I know but once you have kids, it's kinda too late, so I want to be sure he can be father material (which I think he can be with some efforts because he definetely wants them)"
"This guy was either looking for an excuse to dump you or he's seriously nuts. Probably a combination of the two. And he sounds abusive. Grooming you to tolerate his bullshit by ""punishing"" you every time you question him or say/do the ""wrong"" thing. 

Don't meet up with him and prolong this shitshow. Be done with him. He's doing you a favor.

Do you honestly want to spend the rest of your life with someone who gets mad at you for literally nothing? Who scrutinizes your every move? Who literally won't let you get up and take a pee in the night without an interrogation? This is absolutely insane. 

And the whole, ""I'm dumping you immediately for accusing me!"" smacks of someone who doth protest too much. As in, he probably did take that toiletry bag somewhere else so he had to feign outrage to make you the bad guy. Regardless, he's a loser. You dodged a huge bullet. DO NOT get back together with this guy. DO NOT apologize to him anymore. Block him and be done with his bullshit."
"OP, please take this comment to heart and do what is right for you. Fuck that guy, he doesn't care about you. He is playing you and using you."
Exactly a great big fuck off and if they don't listen hit them!
"Proud of you and congratulations! Please call the cops if he comes looking for you! If he tries to contact you or find you in person, start keeping a record of everything, date, time, what he did/said. It will be helpful if you end up needing a restraining order. Hopefully it doesn't come to that and he leaves you alone, but better to be prepared! Good luck to you!!"
Lol no you don't bruh
"its just when do i know to talk to him again? like a a week,  a month? i hate not knowing when things will happen. 

i guess i just have to deal with it and focus on other things."
"Here’s a fun story I’ve shared elsewhere. I found dirty panties, nowhere near my size, a flog, and handcuffs (which were mine) in his overnight bag. When confronted he said he found them all in his sock drawer and wanted to ask me what I’d been up to. All I could do was laugh at him. This was the day after I found a girl’s tank top in his laundry. He explained that by saying one of his coworkers must have left it in a locker at work. "
"He probably has a dating pattern.  He gets serious fast, starts mentioning marriage, extends the honeymoon period as far as he can, then starts another casual relationship to transition into, while he gaslights his current potential ""Mrs X"", relocates his toiletry bag to the newer potential ""Mrs X's"" bathroom, and proceeds to leave the former in a vat of confusion over WTF just happened.  

If his toiletry bag could talk......."
So happy for you! I'm glad your support system cares and is supporting you. There are often more people out there to help than we think : )
"In addition to not wanting animals to impact people, there's also potentially a want for people to not impact animals. I would not allow pets in my apartment because my boyfriend regularly drops pills and just... doesn't pick them up. A pet would be at a decent risk of accidental poisoning."
"I’m confused as to why you even posted this? Based on your replies it seems like you just wanted strangers on the internet to tell you that your girlfriend is unreasonable and because they’re not you’re kinda being a snippy jerk in the comments.

Your girlfriend may have lived with the dog when she was at your mom’s house but she was a guest and couldn’t make rules. Now she has her own place which she shares with you and she does not want a dog in her house. It’s not unreasonable and she’s compromised by letting the dog be in the garage. Your mother and brother’s feelings can matter to you but it’s not their house. It’s clear you’ve gotten a response to this situation and many people don’t think your girlfriend is wrong or unreasonable. "

"&gt;I was simply looking for advice here to understand if anyone thinks she is being unreasonable in her stance

"....OP get the *heck* away from this horrible person. 

He leveraged your deceased mother to win your trust. Whether those dreams occurred or not, a healthy, considerate person doesn’t talk about it this way. 
It was not romantic. It is manipulation.  And I think once you walk away from this fully you need to see a therapist. That alone was enough of a red flag to alert you that he wasn’t stable and felt very entitled to your life. I’m angry for you. "
Why is it fascinating?
"Specific boundaries is totally different then saying ""I am not going to trust you because someone else cheated on me"". "
"It is definitely not unfair to break up with him. Frankly, I would break up with him for wanting to go to another country to kill people for money"
"It is sad to read brother, please take care of yourself. If your partner wants try counseling then fight for her. You have a vested interest with her in love and life. However; there may be other reasons, is she confused about the recent miscarriage and has fallen into depression, has she started a emotional affair with some one she has met whilst staying with friends? 
Depression can be treated. 
However: if it is a new relationship she has secretly started then This may be the reason why she left so to try thing with this person to see if she can take the new relationship to the physical level. To take the emotional affair to a physical one and see if it is better than your life. The bad bit here is in a new relationship there are differing chemicals being released in the brain. And this is why we make the wrong decisions as they need the chemicals to continue to be released. They say listen to the heart not the brain. The heart is a muscle or a pump, the brain is the thinking bit; however: it wants the dopamine from the new relationship to continue the relationship high. She has to cut all contact with the new person. 

Respect yourself first, this is always hard as we normally place our wives on a pedestal, but they are human and make mistakes just like us all. 
The final thing is if she doesn’t or won’t meet you half way re the relationship then part as friends so to still have her in your life than as a bitter twisted ex wife. As well if she has placed the marriage in a friendship zone and won’t let it go back to the loving zone. Then this also is hard to has to accept but she won’t work on it you will only continue to be hurt you should move on amicably. You must come equally in love and life it cannot be one sided. 

Best of luck in life and hope you get her back. 👍❤️🇦🇺"
He only started last semester. I had two classes with him last semester - a sculpture class and an independent research. He is also my professor for my last independent research this year. He frequently does not give me his full attention and his “meetings” with me every week are barely five minutes. 
"Would you feel any differently if he'd slept with sex workers from your home culture who just happen to like the gig or needed the money?

Essentially, you're stuck parsing the difference between a slave and someone motivated by economics. And if it's the latter, the harm he's doing is somewhere between 'minimal' and 'non existent'.

It could be that your revulsion just isn't rational here. If you can't see that, then divorce away. But occasionally participating in an economic transaction where the morals are muddy isn't the end of the world. 

Prohibition itself causes more human trafficking than paying individual sex workers does.

"Thanks for this explanation, my husband is anxious and worries/obsesses about certain things. I usually try and do what you've suggested, and strike a balance between being understanding but making him realise it isn't a thing to worry about. He also does mindfulness, exercise and meditation which he's finding helpful."
You can't get everything you want. Your girlfriend compromised already by letting the dog in the garage. End of story.
"Maybe an antianxiety med would help.

Xanax, a given, clonipin, etc.

"If I wanted to use her sibling to talk to her and/or sneakily get back together with her that's one thing, but I do just want it to be a professional career thing.

"&gt;I have never been to the Dr in more than 20 years, it scares the crap out of me

I get it man - I HATE the doctor. Hate it. I avoid going unless absolutely necessary. HOWEVER, as someone who didn't go for about 10 years and finally sucked it up and went, it was SOOOOOO fine. My doctor was nice, didn't judge me AT ALL for not going sooner, asked me basic questions, did basic tests, then was like ""Cya!"" It was soooooooo easy. They'll weigh you, take your blood pressure, suggest blood work (which is optional but obviously recommended) and you'll be out in 10 mins. Honestly. After I left I thought, ""Well she was nice!"" and that's it. I still don't enjoy going to the doctor - it's awkward AF sometimes and VERY personal - but unless you have a medical condition it's something you have to tolerate once a year."
"I’m falling for someone who’s finally good for me and good to me. He makes me feel like I can achieve anything I want and I feel like I have more aspirations just knowing him. We’ve got something planned every month until May and even just chilling with him on the couch talking is fun. 

What he says makes me feel he feels the same way and it’s really nice. Even if it ends up not working out I feel like I’ll be a better person by knowing him."

"Just want to point out that it’s absolutely ridiculous for him to blame her for asking if he was cheating, considering he LITERALLY ASKED HER IF SHE WAS USING CONDOMS WITH OTHER MEN. 

He has been tearing her down and also actually accusing HER of cheating - and then dumped her immediately for suggesting that he may be cheating, after literally all of his actions indicated that he was in fact cheating. 

He is honestly just the worst. OP is so much better off without him. "
"I guess it depends on what you define as trust issues. Being cheated on changed my perspective on relationships entirely. I think you can want to have specific boundaries in a relationship due to being cheated on in the past, as long as you’re clear with your partner about it it’s all good. "

Ok then Calvin Klein
The only mistake you made here was dating an 18-year-old and expecting them to be mature.
Thank you!
My abusive ex was JUST like this. Complete with dumping me every so often for some imagined infraction and then grudgingly agreeing to give me another chance before I said the wrong thing again and was forced to restart the cycle of apologizing. Ugh. And they do it gradually so you second guess yourself and wonder if it IS your fault. Believe me: It's not.
I don’t recommend asking out a coworker. She’s there to do her job and may have just been being friendly as a way to network professionally. Respect that boundary and try to be her friend.

"Thank you. It’s hard to leave her behind while I work on myself, but I’ve been telling myself I can’t make it better with just constant attention. 

I will continue to try and help her find resources, but until then I will do my best to just be by her side supporting her recovery. I hope that will be enough. "

"It sucks that you’re in this position but take this as a blessing and a learning moment. You don’t need to waste anymore time on this guy. Good guys are hard to find, and it takes time to sort the good ones from the bad ones. Heal quickly and find yourself a good man."

"I had a girl do this to me in college and I had to go to the police. Not the campus police, the actual city police. The campus police will sometimes not do much because their reports are tied to the reported campus safety statistics, so sometimes they will minimize or remain inactive to make the school look like it has fewer incidents/crimes. 

You may want to file a police report and then take a copy to administration (student services) and then to the campus police...in that order. "
See this is where you two being quite young comes in. Tell him that's a load of bollocks from romantic comedies.
"In my experience when adults fixated on a celebrity, it tends to be as a ‘safe’ form of love. The celebrity is unattainable, and therefore pristine, perfect and cannot hurt them.

It’s almost impossible to compete against someone like that. It’s also difficult for the person with the crush to accept the sometimes-ugly face of real life love.

It could be that the celebrity has filled an emotional space during a lonely period in this woman’s life and that if that space was filled by a real person, her obsession would dwindle."
"I dated a guy for a year and one day I shut my eyes and asked him what color they were. He said blue. They’re brown. He didn’t have a brain tumor, he just didn’t care enough to notice. That relationship didn’t last much longer. "
"No, because if you go no contact, you can start moving on to a place where you don't care about your ex and you won't know about them dating other people since you won't be in contact with them. "
"Have they had the sex talk with you at all? Are you on birth control? Do you understand the concept of what happens when two people have sex (emotionally and physiologically?)

If you're living in their house, respect their rules. It's great that you're open and honest about how you're feeling, but I would feel so uncomfortable knowing that my daughter is having sex under my roof. "
So? Let him get hurt. He's an adult and he'll deal. You're getting hurt by the lack of space he gives you.
Oh my goodness this is hilarious.
"Take a little time to become comfortable with yourself again, hang out with friends, let your heart heal, and let things happen (with someone else) from there.

"I think it’s a protection thing. Like when he sees his friends he’s usually visiting home for a week or so and thus I’m missing him healthily. But when he has fun with friends it’s sort of like I want him to myself and it upsets me that other people are getting to spend time with him when I miss him and that’s when it gets unhealthy. 

I really hate it. I want him to have a happy time and enjoy time with friends but I can’t be calm when he is. But I’d never ever ever stop him from doing anything because I know it’s just my head acting up "
"Hey there! 

I’m in no way a mental health professional but this sounds a lot like OCD. OCD isn’t just about cleanliness or checking the lock on the door 7 times or whatever. Intrusive thoughts and this level of guilt are signature signs as well. 

It’s something worth looking into. I was diagnosed last year and it has made SO many things like this make more sense in my life. Best of luck!"
"This is true. He started out so complimentary. His friends and family would always tell him how beautiful I am. He posted me constantly on his social media. When I would work out, he would ask me not to lose weight because he liked my shape. So when overnight he became critical, I did not understand it. "
I've been with my BF for just over 7 years! he recently asked my parents for their permission to marry me over the holiday break! I'm excited that our relationship will be moving forward :)
"&gt;so you need to stop thinking that ""We"" (meaning you, your brother, and your mother) get to override your gf's vote. 

This is the biggest underlying issue in this thread.  OP thinks that ""family is important"" = ""they get a full vote in everything he and GF do""  "
Hope he's not being an ass on purpose (like negging you or something). Or is he being awkward about it like thinking its funny to pretend to not know basic stuff about you?
"Honestly I never thought to explicitly ask, he was pretty open about all the other sex related stuff in his past so I thought he already told me everything and didn't ever think he was the kind of person to do that stuff. But I had said before that I could never be with anyone who's done that."

"Too soon imo, but bc of personal reasons. 3 months after we started dating."
"but he did say some mean things to me, and was critical of me"
Dolores!
"It took my partner (29M) well over a year to say I love you. I'm a very affectionate person and I had actually told him first within a few months of dating, but he said he wasn't ready to say it back. We actually broke up (not because of that, somethibf else) and got back together and so I wasn't ready to say it until he did. Which was over a year. But now he says it all the time. In his past reationships, he would wait until he was ready to say it too.

I think we all feel and show love in different ways and it doesn't necessarily have to be in the form of saying I love you. Maybe notice the way your boyfriend is showing you he cares in other ways and give him space to say it whenever he feels ready. "

"You dated for a few months, and even if you like each other, you found you weren't compatible. No matter how crazy you are about each other, you can't have a healthy relationship if you're not compatible in the right ways. You two just weren't a good match. It happens. Move on. 

You're just missing her because you're remembering the good parts, forgetting the fact that you're not actually compatible. Even if she did take you back, you'd just be in the same situation again soon enough, because you're not the right fit for each other."
"It sounds like the irritations about unfinished chores might be looming larger than they need to just because you feel stuck in the house all the time.

You said that you are studying, is there some way you can make some time to get out of the house? Do you leave to study? Can you find something in the neighborhood or community that interests you? Make some new friends, add some things to your life there?

Otherwise, it could be that the two of you have different ideas of the urgency of household chores, or that he reacts differently to those things in proximity of his parents. You could talk about it, but I have a feeling that it might be hard to fix while you are grieving the closeness to family you had, and feeling like him (and his promises) are all you have on hand. If you're sticking this out, you will need to build up your own supports, however slowly. "
"Take it as a learning opportunity, man.  Sometimes you just need a swift, hard kick in the pants.  :D"
So go out without him. You're an adult. Go live your life. It's not like you won't come home. 
"Get over it.

Most of these aren't mementos of the past relationship but practical items. Do you seriously expect him to throw out washer and dryer, cookware, gym and furniture? That would be mindless and wasteful and all just to accommodate some insecurity. Let's not stop there, she's been in the same spaces with him. Should he move to another place to make you feel better? She's touched him, should he trade for another body that she hasn't held and fucked?"
Understand where you are coming from with the feeling like you aren't enough because he watches porn to masturbate but I think it's important to remember that not all guys watch porn to masturbate and not all women Don't Watch porn to masturbate. I think it's really just preference and about the visual stimulation. I watch porn most of the time when I (24f) masturbate about 90% of the time. I don't really give a shit about who is in it or what they look like. There isn't any kind of comparison to my husband its just that the visual stimulation when there is a lack of physical partner helps to speed things along. I have kids and I don't have time to sit and take my time and use my imagination for 30 minutes I need to have the visual stimulation so that I can just kind of be done with it. I'd imagine it can be similar for guys too. Having the visual just helps things when you don't have your partner there with you.
"Congratulations! Good for you for reaching out for support, and it's wonderful that you have loving people in your corner looking out for you. Onward and upward!"
"You’ll know when you’ve found the right one. They’ll fight for you, they’ll love you through everything, they won’t put you down and make you feel less than them. You’re worthy, anyone who shows you differently has got to go. "
i’ve been dating my bf for 3 years and this would DEFINITELY bother me. mainly the fact that it’s average girls he knows in real life AND that he made a secret instagram to do so... it sounds like no good
"Get yourself a backyard table set, and then look into some of the different board and card games there are. There has been an explosion, so there is something for everyone. If you just want something that is fun but doesn't hurt your brain, there are many many kinds of that. If you want to take something with you to a restaurant, there are things like that too.

Remember that it is okay if people like different things. He is trying to combine quality time with one of his hobbies to show that he loves you, but it is just not working out and that is okay. Find a different way to have quality time that you can both appreciate and will both meet your Love Languages and needs as individual people."
"Because he is a man and most man do it. You might not find it appealing, but most men do. Why ? I have no idea.

Yeah youre making a bigger deal than what it is. If it has negative consequence on your sexual relationship, okay thats bad. If it has no negative consequence, then you should get over it."
"I only asked because my parents only allow my boyfriend to come around my house, and since we can’t hang out in public places together or at his house even, I wanted to talk to them about sex since wouldn’t it be better to know your daughter is safe at home and not having sex with her boyfriend somewhere you don’t know about?"
"It's really so painful to me to admit this but I agree and I'm really starting to think she's just not ready. It hurts a lot because I love her so much, and before we confessed but were flirting and talking so often, it felt so so so so good and she made me so happy, she sounded happier too and it gave me so much strength. But after we confessed it's like it all went downhill."
"God, at the smallest things so many people on this sub are always like “dudes an asshole, break up!”. He accidentally threw away your toothbrush? He’s a dick, find a new one. Forgot to take out the trash? What a monster! Break up!

I’ve been with my husband for 10 years. I’m not even sure he remembers my first name. He has to know my last name since we share that but..my first name? I have no clue lol He never uses it, at least not when we’re around each other. He’d probably never admit it either if he actually didn’t remember. He’s in too deep now to let that secret out. Hell, I tease him about it often. 

Does he care about me? Does he love me? Of course he does. We’ve only had one big snafu in our relationship and we worked on it together, as a team. 

Anyway, what I’m trying to get at here is - I know you’re hurt but in the grand scheme of things - is it really that big of a deal? Guys (and girls) forget silly details all the time. Make a joke out of it. 

If he hasn’t always been a bit scatter brained, definitely have a lil talk about maybe seeing doctor cause something could actually be wrong but other than that..this really doesn’t have to be that big of a deal unless you want it to be."
"Every asshole and bitch I’ve met has defended themselves with “I’m just being blunt” or “real”. Yea maybe sometimes, other times your just being a fucking dick. "
Exactly the same happened to me. I am fairly young though but I still lost all of my friends and more than 3 years of life and education. Relationship with family was also affected. And yes its true its difficult to not feel lonely since she was all I had.
"I hate drama, I prefer the mature way. I think I will simply cut him off, I am getting tired expectations being given to then broken; even communication doesn't seem to be fixing this

He has let me down more times than he has lived up to expectations, so I do expect that he may always be late but what's wrong is 1. giving me excuses, 2. exaggerating (lying), and 3. trying to belittle me

This is so toxic from my perspective"
"Don't contact him anymore. Don't bother trying to make sense of anything he has said in the last month. Everything he said to you was a way of tearing you down through emotional abuse and manipulation. He was very likely cheating and projecting on to you. My ex did the same thing and I wish I had seen it sooner. It took me 18 months of this exhausting bullshit to finally break up with him. You got out before it got any worse, so don't let it drag on any longer. You will be happier without him. "
"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously, fucking YES!!  I'm so proud of you!!  I know how terrifying the step of leaving is, I've done it, and I am so glad to see you are putting steps in place to protect yourself.  Now go heal and live your awesome life!!"
"They don’t let me leave the house, as I’m being tracked on my phone by this Life360 app. And I’m pretty sure it alerts them if I’m on the move."
"It’s a very similar feeling for many people though.  Comforting is still care giving. And regardless, it’s a definite boner killer. "
Wow.  I don't even know where OP is coming from then.
"When people start to work in office environments, they tend to put on 'office personas' - projecting an image of a together, competent professional.  These mannerisms, aversion to sensitive topics and general demeanor seems to seep into people's personalities as well. 

Lives of quiet desperation (- H. Thoreau), etc., have been around for a long time."
"Communication is key, and i hope you spend more time together
"
"Hi,
I deleted the previous posts detailing more stuff, because at the time I was afraid he would find them. 
Thank you for your concern. As stated, I'm already in therapy, working on myself.
:) "
Why do you watch movies or play games? To satisfy some sort of entertainment need. Same thing with porn. It's just to satisfy a sexual entertainment need.
"??? Why is he still your boyfriend?! Girl, give YOURSELF the love you're wasting on this loser!"
"Yes, I’m going to college, but their plan is to pay for it so I’m forced to stay here even though I want to live on my own. And yeah, that seems to be their only reasoning so far.. And it’s funny because I wanted to lose my virginity to him at 16 (I know, I was stupid, thank god I actually waited) and they told me to wait until I was 18. Now that I’m here, they’re saying in my 20s."
Then be prepared to live like this for the rest of your life. 
"If you know now it will be a source of conflict later, you may want to start some professional therapy and try to soften that fear.  I'm in your daughter's shoes, and I still can't decide if a pet that helps IMMENSELY with my anxiety is worth seeing my stepmom less."
Quite a lot. We actively spend at least a good chunk of the afternoon/evening 3 days through the week and then usually a full day on the weekend together. 
"Olive branch warmly accepted! I think we are both coming at this from our own interpretations of reading between the lines and filling in some blanks based on our own experiences, and I think in my last response especially I got too entrenched in wanting to be RIGHT, when it's clear there's no ""right"" answer here. A truce!

Also, when someone is really rubbing me the wrong way, I, too, creep their history to try and get a feel for who I'm disagreeing with. Thanks for taking the time to offer me some kind words, instead of airing my dirty laundry. You are a decent person, and your response made me glad we ran across each other, even if it started with me shit-stirring in response to your post (which I decided was just TOO DAMNED SUPPORTIVE--I am in some sort of mood today.)

Be well, stranger!"
"That's why no matter how extreme or potentially fake-sounding posts about abuse are here, I always treat them as though they're real. So much better to occasionally entertain a piece of fiction than to ignore or dismiss someone who genuinely needs help."

Hackgod330 is the best try him out and you will never regret 
"I don't think it has to do with age, being late is bad manners; being able to organize your time is a skill you learn at school very young"
"Yes... which is what I’m afraid of mostly, as I don’t ever want to disobey them. "
I first want to say that you're worthy of happiness. You are absolutely loved and I feel genuine joy that you have stood up and taken control of your life again. I wish you nothing but love and light with this new chapter. Stay strong. 
Have you talked to him about it?
"Oh my goodness, girl. I feel for you so much.

I made the mistake of getting involved with a coworker last spring. Only now am I able to properly move on, and that is because I finally got a new job and quit. It got so bad that every time I even saw him I would be on the verge of tears. 

Just have to say, I can't believe he did all of that to you. What an absolutely aweful situation, that you never ever deserved. 

I endured many months of mind games with the guy I got involved with at work. He got a girlfriend eventually and flaunted her to me as well. He wanted to hurt me. I could tell that he enjoyed seeing me in pain and I felt so betrayed by this guy who had spent a long time befriending me, gaining my trust and ultimately seducing me.

This situation was one of the most draining and agonizing ones I've ever been in even though I've gone through things that most people would consider much worse. I actually fell in love with this guy, or the character he pretended to be.

But what I went through is nowhere close to what you must be going through. So I just cannot imagine the level of hurt and grief and betrayal you are feeling. My heart goes out to you. 💗😢

All that being said, I really think you need to try and find a way out by getting a new job. Once I never had to see my co-workers stupid handsome face again, everything took a huge upswing. I know that is going to be hard, considering all the stress you are under. If it is possible to take any kind of break from your job while you are initiating the process of planning your exit, even just a sick day or two, that will help.

Something I've realized after going through what I did in my heartbreaking situation is that 1)obviously don't ever get involved with a coworker 2) narcissists are bloody everywhere and 3) I'm really strong. I actually gain pride and strength and feel so much self-compassion now when I look back at all the gruelling manipulations I withstood while remaining a pretty decent, competent, and loving person. 

And I can tell from your post that you are clearly really fucking strong.

You probably already know the saying ""hurt people hurt people"", but it helped me a little to remember that once so I thought I may as well add that, too. I actually feel a bit sorry for these people who act in these incredibly immature, callous ways. They are so hurt and unaware that they act on autopilot and cause so much havoc around them. 

Anyway, I feel like I said a million unhelpful and clichéd things here, but I just want you to know that I'm relating to and rooting for you big time and that you're not alone. If you ever need to talk to someone you can talk to me! "

I didn't realize it until it was to late....I do want to actually want to be with her...I would do anything to get her back...:(
"Damn this sounds really familiar to my own brain. Except it wasn't an ex, it was a new mutual friend who is extremely attractive. Both my bf and I are attracted to ladies so we tend to be open about complimenting other ladies, but something about her made my brain wig out.

I did what you did for a while, tried to logic my way out of it.

Then I talked to my bf about it and got a better perspective on his attraction level (purely visual as she wasn't his type).

Then I did the truly brave thing and talked to my friend about it. It was hard, it felt kinda awful, but we both appreciated the honesty. She had dealt with other ladies just staying jealous and avoiding her before, so the talk let us be open and it made it so much better.

She is still someone I would call a best friend, she has stayed at my house before for several weeks, I plan on her being in our wedding.

Be open with him, get some perspective and let him know yours. Don't be accusatory even if your brain wants you too.

Good luck"
"I'm in a relationship and I've used the Bumble friendship feature. I've hung out with two people off it after chatting with them briefly on the app. As long as she's over her ""jerk to girls"" phase and knows how to be friendly, I think this is a great idea. Probably won't be that many people nearby since it sounds like you're in a small town but, it's worth a shot!"
Definately finish what you started. Help the guy out. I agree you would look selfish if you just dropped everything. Be a good guy and help him out.
"Gonna hard disagree - if the relationship breaking brought her to getting herself under control and getting the help she needed, it was absolutely an important milestone. "
"Right? In therapy, it’s not just “oh this is why you’re fucked.” It’s also helping to find new thinking patterns to be healthier and more joyful. Most people are walking around telling themselves at least one lie that leads to major dysfunction, and sometimes uncovering the truth takes some help."
"The middle-of-the-night incident sounds like it could have been a dream or sleep paralysis, some people really think they see something scary in the middle of the night and it can feel very real. But the rest of it just sounds like a terrible, paranoid, controlling bf. I think you're lucky he broke up with you as he is not boyfriend material."

"I like that you get my drift.But do not entertain the idea of pursuing someone just because they are accomplished.You can tell if someone is accomplished if you ask them about relationships in the early stages of your interaction(second date).Have that discussion with them,you can tell a lot about a peraon if you ask them about relationships.You need to trust me on this,I have tried it on many people and it has saved a lot of time and effort that was going to go to waste."
"Did... Does your boyfriend have financial issues? It sounds like the woman bought practically his entire home for him while not even living with him.  


Things like a washer, dryer, printer, coat rack etc. aren't exactly memorabilia - they're stuff you use. I don't really understand being upset about any of these things either except perhaps the decorations and pillows, since you could consider those more emotional gifts. The rest though? That sounds like your boyfriend got a pretty damn sweet deal out of his previous relationship somehow."
"Blindfolding is a territory that can get murky with a whole new connotation something quick.

Tell her that you hurt her request and invite her over  to eat dinner, and ask ahead of time if she would like to do it blindfolded , offering to be blindfolded yourself  when eating the meal . Try not to let things go over 20 minutes blindfolded, but whenever she says stop immediately stop. Be prepared to help her. Watch some videos ahead of time on how blind people eat and manage, and be and be prepared to offer tips if she would like them. It helps a lot when doing new things if you are willing to try them yourself.

As you are new in a relationship, and because of how foul the connotations with blindfolds can get, I would be very leery of doing much else this early in the game. The last thing that you want is to plan a loving Valentine's Day and then labelled the next day as a potential serial killer among your social circles.

Communication and consent is key."
I give you permission to move out and get your own room.
Insults are childish.
"There's a lot going on here.

I agree with her that neither of you are any healthy place or even a place where you belong in a relationship at all. When a person is depressed they have nothing to give in a relationship, as they can barely take care of themselves. Part of her depression is little bit of self-destructiveness as she is looking for people who are not there.

At this point the relationship has been over for a long time. I would advise both of you to take care of business and get healthy.

You cannot go through life wondering if this choice will work or if that one will. It will torment your heart and soul to death and there will be nothing left of you. Instead, resolve yourself that if something is meant to be then it will be - but it may be in the future. This way you can live each day to its fullest, and appreciate each moment for what it is. This may seem absurd and Flowery, but really when you talk to people who have been married for a long time, they will tell you that it simply worked out that they would be together and that it was pretty easy."
"This dude’s clearly a lunatic. Don’t even bother looking for an explanation for his crazy behavior, because there clearly isn’t one. You’re definitely better off without the guy though. "
"Just as you are responsible for taking care of yourself and are taking steps to be healthier, she’s equally responsible for doing the same things for herself. All you can do is encourage and support her, and whether or not she chooses to follow through is up to her. If you could have any control over any of this, you would be helping her, right? Since you don’t have any control over it, and since you have every right to work on improving your own situation, what are you feeling guilty about?"
"You guys have quite the love story. Please go to her and make it right this time. For her, it has always been you that she loves, and for you, it has always been her that you love. Nothing makes you guys truly happy except each other. "
"""Hey, want to go on a coffee date on X day?"" If she says yes, exchange numbers."
"Good point, didn’t know that subreddit existed! "
There’s really not a whole lot you can do sometimes romance dies. Long distance doesn’t work especially since y’all have only been together for a year. I wouldn’t waste my energy on a relationship that’s going dead already a year in. 
"All you here clearly do not have complicated foreign last names. ;) If anyone remembers mine, I'd be impressed.

If he mostly refers to you by the nickname, the nickname is going to be more likely to stick.

I don't remember anyone's birthday, really, I routinely forget my own parents' birthday.

"
It’s the fact that he told you literally everything that she bought him. It would have been better if he just didn’t bring it up or lied about it. 
"So, based on your post I think the reason you’ve haven’t kissed anyone yet is cause you’re passively waiting for it to happen. You write that you’ve never “been kissed” like it’s something that happens to you not something you make happen; you weren’t  approached; you never got asked to dance, guys don’t hit on you etc.

I think it’s your attitude that’s holding you back. If you want something, do something to earn it. Ask a guy out, tell someone you like them, go on a date and move in for the kiss if it feels right. 
"
"As far as I know their relationship is about as close to perfect as it can get. I haven’t seen them have a single fight, and if they did I would know because she tells me everything. They also spend almost all of their free time together and don’t seem to be tired of each other at all. However, it is still early in their relationship. And as far as I know neither one of them are really jealous people, and they aren’t considering an open relationship. 

I know the girl has had sex with close friends before and that I have too without any negative impact, but I’m not sure about him. We’re all extremely open about our sex lives with each other. The other night he let her eat his ass and put a finger in his ass and he told me about it the first time he saw me after and begged me to let someone do it to me so I’d know what it was like, so we have no problem talking about that kind of stuff. 

I’d also say that we communicate pretty well. Any problems any of us have had with anything since we all moved in has been solved in maybe two days max. And when we moved in we made a list of rules that we all contributed to and haven’t had any problem not breaking those rules. 

And for the finial question we broke up for a lot of reason. The main one being that it was just a toxic and painful relationship for both of us. We came together and agreed that we are better off just as friends. Another reason is with where i am in life and with everything that going on right now I’m not ready to be in a relationship. I can say with 100% no doubt that I do not have feelings for her, and while I’m sure she doesn’t have feelings for me I can’t be positive. "
"I'm tired of arguing. on some things we wont agree. But a little clicking through and you seem cool and I'll just leave this in hopes of an olive branch. take care -

1. jealous of putting some real time behind quitting, something I'm struggling with. props to you.

2. my partner teaches 1st grade. she recently bought some like rubbery stretchy toys for her fidgeters because theyre quiet. I know it was an old post.
"
"I hope you saved a copy of some of the texts/docs, etc. It will help you show the cops just how bad it’s been. Helps get a restraining order."
"&gt; informed me that he intends to use that time to work on his own art

So absolutely nothing to do with its intended purpose? Get an email from him stating that and then forward it to his boss requesting that it be dealt with because you’re very busy and have work to do. Then show up at your requested time since no-one is using it for work anyway. If he tries to keep you out go over his head. 

What a tool."
"Because he doesn’t take the relationship seriously. He’s giving you SO many hints. I don’t think you’d realize it even if he smacked you in the face with it. 

Love sure is blinding. "

"&gt;I think I’m going to work on reframing my current view of them from “ex FWB” to “friends” (which was something someone mentioned in another comment which really struck a chord with me.) 

Commenting quickly as someone who's been dating a man who's friends with all kinds of ex's: something that's helped me become comfortable with this kind of dynamic has been the fact that I get to meet a lot of these women. If my boyfriend has hooked up with this person and they still regularly talk or see each other in social situations, it's inevitable that I'll meet them because him and I are usually going ""out"" together. Guess what I discovered? They're all super chill and nice. Basically there's a REASON he still see's them as friends. Putting faces to these women and actually interacting with them has been extremely helpful for me. I'm way more likely to have a jealous feeling creep up about ""a girl"" that I've never met vs someone who I know, and someone who I personally see as a friend of mine too.  "

Sure it sounds annoying but if it's twice a year I'd just accept it myself. "
"My name isn’t Jordana, I just used that as an example. My name ends in ‘ana’ and he thought it ended with ‘an.’ I also go by a nickname 99% of the time. The last time my last name came up was probably a few months ago. We’ve only talked about it maybe two or three times since we’ve known each other, so maybe he genuinely just doesn’t remember? I feel like that’s a pretty essential thing to remember though. "
"This is so strange. I don’t have the greatest memory; it’s a running joke between me and my coworker that I’ve complimented her on the same jacket 20 times and thought it was new every time. But I have not forgotten anyone’s name :/. Like other commenters said, encourage him to see a doctor. Something weird is going on. "
"I never said I was  considering breaking up my family, I said i want him to understand i need space without him getting all mad at me. And that is a past I can never accept, we've talked at the beginning of the relationship about that and I told him I could never be with someone who has done that, yet he didn't think to tell me."
"I like my MIL, but I'd be reconsidering a relationship with my husband if he fully expected me to prioritize his mother's happiness over mine. My happiness and comfort should matter to him more than his mother's.

I don't set out to make her unhappy but there are some things I will never do despite how much it would mean to my husband and his mother, because I'm uncomfortable with it. "
"Good luck, there isn't a good way to do it other than come with all the facts and don't hold anything back to protect his feelings, if it's anything that ends it, it will be anymore lying."
"You wouldn't let someone treat your best friend or sister or mom this way. Please tell someone what has happened. Google ""domestic abuse hotline"" if you can't bring yourself to tell someone you know. If he didn't want to hurt you, he wouldn't. Something is wrong with him and you cannot leave yourself in harm's way to see if he will fix it. Please, please tell someone you care about this, and also google ""Why Does He Do That"" by Lundy Bancroft and read the free pdf. Please do not believe his apologies. He wants you to stay with him so he will say anything to get you to stay. It's not real. Please do not progress further in this relationship until you have at least told someone what he has done, out loud, preferably someone who cares about you."
Oh man that cut me deep. Thanks for your honesty. Our relationship is so toxic and embarrassing...
"Dude, your relationship is dead and she's moving on. Go no contact with her so you can move on as well. Otherwise, you're just gonna end up hurt when she starts dating and fucking other people."
"He’s at the point he’s choking you. Girl, next time you’ll be dead.
Leave."
"&gt;She made it a point to say she only spoke to him when he came in. Why lie?

Could be many reasons, but consider that one of them could be that she knows you're an insecure mess and didn't want to upset you. I don't know all of your history and I don't want to jump to conclusions, but you seem the type to assume the worst, which makes me inclined to play the devil's advocate.

&gt; ""You had 2 moths to try and get in t ouch with me. And no, 12:30 in the morning texts don't count."" 

If this was written by the guy and she never responded, he honestly sounds like kind of a persistent creep and the fact that she didn't respond to that at all should give you some clues about how she feels about this person. If this was written by her, yeah that's a bit strange, though still the fact that they apparently weren't in touch for 2 months to me tells me that whatever is going on there isn't very serious or positive. It's a weird exchange in any case, and she clearly wasn't super keen on being in touch with the guy. Again, keep in mind that she might know full well how you would react to this which might be a reason why she didn't tell you and/or told you a white lie about their being in contact.

Again, you really sound like you have some jealousy/insecurity/trust issues. Consider getting some private counseling to help you deal with this and get some perspective, which might also help you move on from the whole situation actually."

"There are 6 levels of emotional validation. None of them are “damn that sucks” 

Like I said in my comment, I have no advice to offer as I found myself in a similar situation &amp; ran away from it because I didn’t know what to do or how to help ease the anxiety of my partner, again because it’s not my job. 
Personally, I think op’s boyfriend needs to really bunker down in his therapy sessions to get to the bottom of his anxieties. Turning sex, supposed to be a pleasurable experience, into 75% comforting your partner because they can’t get you off? This isn’t her problem, but she may be enabling him &amp; making the anxiety worse. The strongest wolf is the one you feed. "

Can you specify better?
"Your BF needs to confront them and set boundaries. 

You need to, disable the doorbell, change the locks, and not answer the door when they come over. Put a do not disturb sign on your door. 

If they keep stomping boundaries, sell and move. Which sucks but has gotta be better than this constant harassment. "
So incredibly happy for you!

"I don't think you're wrong to feel how you do. You were uncomfortable and you are well within your right to ask someone to stop doing something to your body that makes you feel uncomfortable. Her asking before initiating anything would have been a respectful thing to do. 

I'm not saying it makes it right, but it seems she misread the situation and made an assumption. She should have apologized for that and for making you uncomfortable but I think that's all she's in the wrong for. It's obvious she didn't want to make you feel violated. She did stop when you asked her to and she is not wrong that you could have set the tone for what you were ready for. If you didn't know where that was until the line was crossed that is normal but now you know for future encounters. "
"I think it's cute that everyone is telling you it's perfectly fine that your man continues to visit ""friends"" he had sexual chemistry with.

I get it. People treat jealousy as some horrible emotion to have on these subs. However I think some people have to be either emotionally NUMB or promiscuous themselves when they state they are immune to thoughts like this."
"&gt; She said she’ll have some trust issues with him.

*with him*...even though he hasn't cheated on her, someone else did.  That's a red flag.  She cannot project trust issues that someone else caused, onto him."
You are with the wrong guy. My husband would be happy to do any or all of those things with me. This is just a matter of compatibility.
"Do you know any of his friends who could keep an eye on him in case he is going through some kind of mental health crisis? Of course it's more likely he's just being a shite human being - it's amazing just how long some of these can keep their shittiness under wraps. But his behaviour makes so little sense that I don't think I could rule out mental illness entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

"Everyone else seems to be locked into this whole garage thing. I could be totally wrong, and feel free to say so, but - it's not about the damn garage.

It's about ""hers"" and ""his"" and building the ""yours together"".

My perception is that you seem to be much more engaged on the ""yours together"" front than she is; one explanation might be that the divorce left her deeply shaken and in need of clear boundaries around her assets, which is understandable and reasonable. But it sounds like maybe she's shifting that protectionist tendency farther - feeling otherwise insecure that you might strip her of her value again.

Her issue isn't the garage. She's reinforcing the boundaries around ""hers"" because you haven't offered her the financial and asset protection that comes with marriage. 

Your issue isn't the garage. It's the change in expectations, and change in priority. Her behavior doesn't read, to you, as being collaborative in helping you also protect *your* assets.

You sound like a thoughtful person, and a great communicator. Sit down with her and talk this out. You both need to figure out how to work toward inhabiting the space in an ""ours together"" manner, and you can handle that :) "
He's still a stranger that she's only been dating for a week. A month ago she was with a different stranger that she'd only been with for a few weeks. Can't say I blame the sister if this is what OP's love life typically looks like.
"I mean, was there anything actually bad in these texts? Because based purely on this context I would say it's a little ridiculous that she wouldn't be allowed to text a work contact and a past relationship who she's on good terms with. You clearly have some trust/jealousy issues, and she's clearly a little weird about being with you (the reasons for which I can only guess at), you two seem overly dramatic and not very good at communicating with one another respectfully and maturely.

Regardless, if it's your intent to move on from her, I'd go with the standard approach. Avoid contact, don't seek her out on social media or dig into what she's doing, remove things from your immediate surroundings that remind you of her. Reclaim your life and make it about yourself."
Why indulge your mom's neurosis while not backing up the partner you chose to be with? 
I do and I'm going to see her on Tuesday. The only thing is...this current guy I feel like im.using him as a placeholder for someone I actually want. But I do have feelings for this current guy (it might be because he's so like this other guy). But I told him that he's not a placeholder 
So he's a hypocritical asshole?
"&gt;Unconscious bias and slanting is human nature. We all see things from our own perspective.

So yeah, then you agree that you are likely not telling an unbiased, 100% factual account of all this.

You really aren't clearing up the inconsistencies that I see.  But the biggest one is:  if this is honestly just about her not sharing that spot....why in the hell are you bringing up her son's car?  Why are you engaging with commentors about off site storage for his car?  If you claim this has *nothing* to do with that spot???  And then outright dismiss my point of if you want to go from 50% garage availability to 100% that rent should change.  I just.....don't believe you.

And I guess the biggest WTF is that something like this doesn't come out of nowhere.  What about your actual relationship?  Why would your GF suddenly take away 50% access to the garage??  

You have bigger issues in your relationship.  Deal with those.  The garage is a symptom, not the disease."
"You didn't bring much to the table, being depressed and jobless, and you dated 2 months. You can't possibly think this relationship was an important milestone in your life. Move on."

"This was big news where I am last year: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestar.com/amp/news/gta/2018/04/18/toronto-neurosurgeon-accused-of-killing-wife-to-stand-trial-next-year.html 

A Toronto neurosurgeon was charged with strangling his wife and leaving her body in a suitcase by the side of the road. Please don't let that be you one day. Leave now, while you can."
Dude sounds like a tool. You deserve better...
"Lemme tell you, in the 6 years we've dated, my GF has gained about 30, 40 lbs. Now, I love me a thin gal as much as the next thirsty loser, but there's nothing, and I mean nothing, wrong with the pluffy ones either. You're probably hella attractive still, so stay confident in yourself. 

20lbs is not a crazy lot. You should have an honest talk with your boyfriend. You're only going to get more and more unhappy with this situation if you stay silent. He may not realize how he's hurting you, and if he does, take the time to discuss how you guys can rekindle your attractions. (That doesn't mean the pressure should be all on you to change, or lose weight.)
 It should be a conversation that aims to address how he can reframe his attraction to you, and how to be sensitive to your feelings.



"
"Let's be honest, 99% of breaks have nothing to do with the woman literally being afraid for her life. I'm not saying it's never happened but the number of times we see this used as an excuse is crazy. "
"...Just tell your S/O and take what comes.  your stalker is going to tell him if you don't, and it's pretty much a guarantee you'll be single if he's the one to rat you out."
"Literally everyone reading this understands how apologetic he is every time he hurts you.  They are ALWAYS sorry the first few times. Once he gets that ring on you, he won't feel the need to apologize quite so much or act quite so in pain.  And once you have a child for him to hurt in front of you and threaten you with, he won't ever have to say he's sorry again.

"
"They do not own the home, it’s not even your brothers dog, and your mom is 110% capable of leaving the dog at home. That’s why their feelings don’t matter. Your mom is selfish if she’s upset at the KIND compromise your gf has offered. "
"Is this post a work of fiction, because it's laughable. You got handed a job through nepotism, and you thought cheating was a game. So you're not the hero any any story.

If this is real, I'm more curious about her motivations. Why is she friends with you? Why did she send you those pages? Does she hope you'll become a better person?"
"Thank you! Reading this subreddit helped me a lot when I first started realizing what's happening. I didn't quite know how bad things are before I read stories from other people that sounded a lot like mine. Do you know if there are any other resources with similar stories?

I wish you the best of luck in eventually finding somebody who only wants the best for you. Or staying single, whichever you'd prefer."
"Show this post to your SO. If he finds out from Drew or from some other source, there's no way he's going to believe that your intentions were honorable or that nothing sexual occurred. "
"I for one would not be okay with my boyfriend meeting up with ex-FWB's while travelling, especially if these girls have a history of having unrequited feelings for him. I say that as someone who has no problems with my boyfriend keeping in touch with one of his ex girlfriends. I also keep in touch with my ex-boyfriend. But mind you no one is having private lunches or anything like that (actually she cuts his hair and I can never bother to go with when asked, if you want to count that?)

But like another person here said, if you begin a FWB-kind of relationship without any romantic feelings, you're putting your friendship at risk for sex, so the friendship can't be that deep if you're willing to complicate it and potentially ruin it just to get some. And with the fact that these girls were into him and never got him just tells me that they never viewed the friendship platonically.

This sub tends to be very set on how all prior relationships can turn platonic and friendly and exes and new SO's can all get along together but that completely depends on the dynamic, and IMO, it's very rare. You seem like a level-headed person who isn't jealous for no reason, so if you feel a cause for concern, follow your gut and bring it up with your SO. "
"What on earth are you getting out of this relationship that is actually worth it? And what does he bring to the table that makes him worthy of a second chance after the cheating and betrayal? 

You're depressed every day because of this guy. Move on. Leave him in the past for good. He's got too many issues. "
Thanks. You're probably right. But that realization is what I am trying to get over. What was real and what was her just using me. 
"A couple years back I was in a similar ""funk"". Grief therapy and stuff didn't really help because I'd already processed the grief. It was just mental wear and tear that just kept coming. One good thing would happen and the  several bad things would happen in sort succession. It was just a shit time.

The best thing I can suggest is he look for a new job and just take one day at a time. Eventually it'll get better. Not all at once, but one day he will wake up and realize the worst is behind him."
"Of course he is apologetic...if he wasn't, you wouldn't stick around to be abused more.  He's not in pain, he's acting."
Lots of good advice in this thread. You should also check out a book called *The Gift of Fear.*
"You spend a third of your lifespan sleeping. It HAS to be done right, or you can have so many cascading health issues. If she's getting in the way of that, she's not part of the solution."
"Spot on. I get so mad reading these posts where the OP is being a complete and utter doormat, supporting and trusting some cheating, lying mooch. "
"Okay, so I have past history with one of my closest friends. My partner doesn't like it, but came to accept it and we've made it work, with some hiccups along the way. 

The key difference is a) I have never cheated on my partner, b) I am open, upfront, and clear with where we go, what we do, when we do it, etc etc etc, c) I don't fucking blame my partner for being psycho. This dude is a manipulative cockbadger, and for your own sake leave, or there's literally nothing anyone else can do for you. "
"Is there stuff that you can try outside the bedroom or as foreplay to boost his confidence? Maybe afterwards talk about how much you enjoyed it. My boyfriend really likes it the day after when I just text him things like, ""I really enjoyed last night."" Maybe you could also be specific, tell him, ""Every time you do X it drives me wild"". Maybe he could also get specific about what he feels happens during a happy or fulfilling sexual experience, to sort of set a goal to attain. You could also try incorporating those affirmations into foreplay, ""i love you, I'm attracted to you, I'm staying with you."" It sounds like he really needs to hear those affirmations. If you can incorporate them into other places in your life he may not feel as much need for them during intimacy. Be vocal throughout the day about things he does that you appreciate and admire, and when you notice something about him that you find attractive, tell him! "
Testosterone levels can impact people in this manner. He may benefit from getting his levels checked.
"&gt;I'm trying to decide if I should ask S why he invited/planned for him to come

Why would you ask him that question in the first place? What does it matter? Not trying to be rude, but it seems like you're making this situation all about you and it's not about you. Everyone else has moved on...you're the one who ended the relationship (almost 6 months ago!), your ex has a new gf, etc. So what if he comes to happy hour? His friends still work there. So what if he comes to your company party with his friends? 

Just ignore him. You ended things, but it seems like you're still hung up on him or worried about what he's doing and why. You've been polite and mature, just keep it that way. "
"&gt; He has grown to hate him and he has become verbally abusive to me and he has hurt me so much with his words.

This tells me and should tell you everything you need to know. This guy is completely unhinged and his expectations are bizarre to say the least.  You are 25 years old...does he really think you've never been with or dated anyone else? Does he expect to be your first ""everything""? 

This guy sounds nuts. You've only been together 6 months...way too soon to talk about marriage anyway, much less with someone who is obsessed with your ex and abusive. He's also manipulative. If you're only 6 months into a relationship and already saying it has been really difficult and trying to get him to go to therapy with you, this is NOT a good relationship. 

Run, run, run, run, run. "
"My husband is 100000000% the same way with preferring to stay in over going out.  The difference, though, is that he is conscious enough to understand that I (and many people) are different from him AND that he needs to compromise if he wants to be in a relationship. I don't see that with your boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  He'll say things like ""Why do you need to go out? it's not like you're there to talk to anyone. Unless you want to go and flirt with guys"" 

&amp;#x200B;

That is shitty and manipulative.  It's not a ""joke"", it's a way to make you feel bad and give in to staying home, whether he consciously intends it to be that or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Sit him down, explain that you get that he doesn't understand your need to go out once in a while, but you DO expect any partner of yours to RESPECT that, as well as to compromise so that both of your needs are getting met.  My husband gets loads of alone time (a full day per weekend, plus 2-3 hours at least 2 nights a week).  I use those times to go out with friends if I want to, or do my own thing.  BUT, the compromise is that 2 or 3 nights a week he goes with me on a walk or bike ride, and at least 2-4 times a month we go OUT for a date.  We do this because we BOTH care about meeting each other's needs.  You need to find out if your boyfriend actually cares about your needs being met, whether he understands those needs or not.  If he doesn't, then cut bait.  It's only 4 months and you are learning he's selfish and no willing to compromise.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, my husband and I both work incredibly physically and mentally exhausting jobs.  We get being tired...but we make sure we spend quality time that meets each of our needs, and make sure to get enough sleep on the weekends so that we have the energy to go out."
"&gt; tell me since my mom used to buy me presents all the time just because, he wants to exist in that space for me now.

Oh, *fuck.*

Sweetheart, this just gets worse and worse.  Can I guess that your self-esteem isn't great?  Once again, someone with good self-esteem and self-respect would find this to be fantastically creepy, not romantic.  "
Is he that much of a catch?? And how come you didn't use the word rape when he basically raped you?? 
"Yeah, my expectations for my father are very low. I totally understand how it would be closure despite it not being a happy ending. 
Whilst I'm not emotional about past events all these years later and considering that I was so young when I witnessed most of the abuse, I still feel like there is something I need to say or read to really be done with it, for little me's feelings. 
I've talked to my partner and I'm going to think about it for a long time, figure out what it is I need to express or of if I really need to at all. 
I'm sorry your father turned out to be a shit person even after all this time. How did he react when you first messaged him?

"&gt;Wednesday morning I let her know I was getting out. She was like ""yay is everything good now then."" And it's just like no dude. I have to relearn how to walk and it's going to take at least half a year if not longer. She's asking to come over today and idk I'm kind of really hurt. I don't know if I'm just being petty.

She obviously didn't realize the severity of your hospital stay. Yes, you are being petty if you are stonewalling her because of ingnorance on her part."
"Looking at your post history, I can see why your sister may not want you to be bringing guys home, it looks like you have a new guy that is ""the one"" every other week. She's probably worried about a ton of strangers being in her house. You may want to wait until you're seriously dating this guy for a bit before bringing him him home."
"Not even to save her from a toxic relationship? She told me she didn't want to be with him, she was GOING to break up with him, and that she liked me. Flirting is acceptable in this situation."
"Well I have had a very hard time since my mother passed away. I took a year off of dating to heal. He was the first guy I seriously dated since then. I guess I just willfully ignored the signs. 

I normally am the queen of the block button. All of my friends and family are surprised I let it get this far but he caught me during a hard time in my life. "
"&gt; Also the girl (who knows about me and that he has a girlfriend) kept talking and trying to convince him to leave me and run off with her. I understand how difficult depression can be and how confusing your mind can get. 

Depression doesn’t make anyone have emotional affairs. This stuff all happened within weeks of you staring to date during a period of time when things should be at their best. 

For a significant part of the time when you were together, he was entertaining a connection with a woman who was trying to break you up. He may have cut her off (maybe) but you’re not wrong for feeling like it’s just too little too late. 

How long have you been together and when did he say he cut contact?"
She stopped being attracted to you because you did not display manly behaviors.  
"The baby-talk one was the one you deleted.  I’m sorry, but my bull-shit meter is really going off here.  There are three other posts about him that are not deleted and not one mentions him abusing you.  The only post of yours that has been deleted has a title about how his baby talk annoys you.  I think this a major ploy for internet sympathy.  There are people who have actually experienced abuse.  Arguing is not abuse.  Being annoying is not abuse.

Advice stands either way.
"Well I think that acknowledging the fact that you can be needy is already a good start. I feel like being needy is often linked to self-confidence issues.

Theres this saying that says: you can't love anyone if you don't love yourself.

Not saying that you should be alone but just that relationships can be very difficult if you have confidence issues. Your best bet is to work on that. It's hard but it's doable!"
24 and still clubbing that hard? Next. 
"C'mon dude, are you 35, or 15? Grow up! Your wife is entitled to be friends with whoever she wants, she's a grown woman.
Either you don't trust her, or you do. Regardless, this post says a lot about your control issues and lack of self-esteem.
Maybe see a therapist, while you're at it. You're the type of guy that if she were posting her side of this on here, everyone would tell her to leave. Don't be that guy."

"You should suggest a compromise. Men complimenting her isn't something that should hurt you - they're acknowledging that YOUR girl is super attractive, which reflects good on you. She has every right to soak up the compliments as she's likely worked hard to get to where she is. However, knocking you down is not acceptable.

So, the compromise: you will work on your feelings of jealousy and inadequacy when she accepts other men's compliments, and in return she will support you in conversations with them, too.

Snaps are just snaps. Don't worry too much about it."
"Yeah, you're incompatible.

If you *were* compatible, you'd be trading off weekends, or just Sat/Sun. Saturday would be a good ol' decompress day in which the two of you just laze around the house, and on Sunday you'd go out at 9 or 10 for a day of whatever - biking, bowling, meeting friends, etc. And some weekends you'd trade it up, using Saturday for a ""go out and party"" kinda night and spending Sunday sleeping in and lazing around. 

You sound like you're willing to spend some time taking it easy the way he likes, but he's made it very clear that he *hates* spending his admittedly limited free time any other way. 

The shop mechanic at my workplace has a 4-midnight shift. Every other weekend, he gets up at like 6 AM to help his wife set up for a farmer's market (or something along those lines, I forget the exact details) and then he goes there with her. Your boyfriend obviously works worse hours so it's not a totally fair comparison, but when he's being such a passive-aggressive baby about occasionally going out even to do stuff with *his* friends even when he's fully rested... yeah, that relationship ain't going anywhere.

You're seeking a middle ground here that just doesn't exist."

"There's nothing wrong with never being on a date! We all go through experiences at different times. The best part about this is - you don't have to let anyone know! You owe nobody an explanation on your dating history (or lack thereof). 

Enjoy joining the dating game and have fun! Stop thinking too into it. Once you stop sweating the small stuff you will realize just how easy everything falls into place. You got this :) "
Do you honestly want a partner who shoots you down every time you even broach a topic they don't like? If so then go nuts 'cause it sounds like he only cares how you feel when it's convenient for him.
"I used to be this way. After a few months or maybe a year of being with my boyfriend I'd get separation anxiety if he was away for maybe a week and would have to call or text him several times a day... I knew this wasn't healthy and it made him worried and probably annoyed at times. It's tough because anxiety makes you do crazy things, even though you're fine. 

In those moments when you feel the need to talk or be with him just force yourself to take a deep breath and distract yourself. Read a book, watch a show, or work on your hobby. If you can't see him often, plan out a time of day when you can chat so you can look forward to that and not fret about when you'll see/hear from him next.

Anyway, you don't sound as crazy as I was back then so just be aware of yourself and if you do get some crazy anxiety peeking through, check out a therapist and they can help you with ways to relax when those moments get rough."
" Your XSO needs therapy, and everything he is doing is because of his own insecurities. 

 Anyone who literally snaps, accuses, and then goes silent has fundamental issues you cannot help with. His insecurities are coming into the forefront now, and is taking them out on you. That is the key issue right now, and I want you to know there isn’t much you can do. You explained your behavior to him, and he has repeatedly ignored it.

 He may not know he is doing it, but he is certainly being manipulative. That’s what should matter to you the most, and everything you said you did seems reasonable. 

 If I were you? I would cut contact as much as I could, and try my best to move on. Your XSO is being incredibly toxic and manipulative. 

 Don’t ever allow someone to give the silent treatment to you without legitimate reasons. That usually is a sign of emotional abuse.

"“I can’t tell you what I think I saw because I saw nothing since you did nothing but I was startled by you waking up while I was doing something suspicious”


Said this above.

I think he was on his phone while she was sleeping and she woke up and freaked him out and he had no idea how to respond after probably “jolting” so he just spewed dumb shit out as quick as he could think."
I guess I'd be convinced if your post was more like “what can I do to ease my wife's pain while she dutifully bones me?” but less passive aggressive.
"She deprived you of love and you cheated on her and blamed it all on her. This is not a relationship worth having again. She found someone she is happy with and doesn't want to go back to what she had with you. Respect that and let her be happy. Stop looking at what you had and wishing for it to come back. You need to let her go, learn and grow, and find another relationship with someone when you're ready. "
Trust me I’m not crying. What am I doing that is selfish? Being confused?
"Well I'm sorry to point it out but you seem to know that you will only be wasting your time and also, people treat us the way they do because we allow them to. By letting this go when it just feels wrong, you might be telling him that if he does it again, you will still be there and therefore, why would he not? I've been in this type of relationship where I just hoped things would get better so I stayed but it was telling the guy that even if he kept seeing this girl, at the end of the day, I'd be there. Thing really start to change for the better when you place boundaries on what isn't acceptable because it means that you know your worth and you realise you shouldn't put up with it 😊"

"I've tried telling her there's nothing to be self conscious about, and that she doesn't have to be great at it right away. As far as tips, I shared a link with her that honestly explains it way better than i could have ever hoped to.

"Lol, well, I think it's a bit difficult for you to gage whether or not he's bitter. It's true, i didn't elaborate on how cold he is. I don't think it's black and white. 
I know the guy- I think there was a little bitterness involved when he realized I will never sleep with him. He hasn't had a girlfriend in years and hasn't really had luck dating or getting laid (he's told me in detail). "
You're right. I will never hurt anyone like this again. Thank you.
"See if you can find online therapy that you can afford. It might be helpful for you.

At the heart of all this, I think you need to work on your self-worth and confidence. 

&gt;I'm like this with everyone I ever meet. I try and make sure they are happy and that they like me, often to the detriment of myself. I had a very shitty home life and that is how I was taught to behave in order to not get punished or given up by my father.

I'm sorry you had to go through that. It sounds really awful. Now that you are becoming an adult, you get to sort of shape your own identity and become the person you want to be. Part of becoming an adult is also learning how to ""be yourself"" and trust that people will like you for who you are, rather than how you change to suit their needs. That's a lot easier to type than it is to actually do, but it sounds like you already have some good self-awareness, which is a start. You are a hard worker and you sound mature and practical and like you have some goals for yourself that you are working on. All great traits.

Try to accept that your wants and needs have value, and it's okay to make them heard in your relationships. Try and learn about healthy communication with your partner (do some googling) to help you guys through difficult conversations.

It sounds like your dad is maybe not the most helpful/nice guy. And that coupled with your mother's death means you have probably had quite a bit of a rougher start to your life than most people your age. It sounds like in spite of that, you are doing everything you can to make the most of it, and are doing pretty well for yourself. Things can get discouraging at times, but keep going. You will keep learning and keep growing and keep working hard. Keep placing important needs like mental health at the forefront of your life. You are in a difficult transitional period of your life at the moment, but you will get through it. In the meantime, try looking for self-help mental health resources and do what you can to help yourself stay in a good place. Having a social network is a good thing, so make sure you put some effort into friends.

"&gt; I dont want to break our family apart though

YOU didn't break a goddamned thing:  HE DID.

Children don't need married parents who live together, no matter how little they respect each other.  **Children need to be surrounded by loving adults, no matter the living arrangement.**

Don't EVER put this on ""the children!  The children!""

This is YOU, afraid of your life after leaving your husband.  If you thought, ""Hey, life will be great once I get Loser McLoserPants outta it!,"" would you be so reluctant to ""break up the family?""  Change is hard and humans don't like it as a general rule.

But sometimes change is necessary.  Do you really want to be That Woman, the one explaining to her angry grown children that, ""Oh, your dad isn't that bad!  You just don't understand him like I do!""

Really, OP?"
"Great move. She has a history so you're *disgusted?* It's time to grow up.

You believe exes have no place in a successful relationship. That's you. She believes differently. Many people have friendships with exes and do just fine. You're free to cut all your exes out of your life. Given your views, you'll have done so. Your views don't automatically bind her to the same. She can respect her marriage and keep a friendship simultaneously."
"Exactly what I wanted to say. I actually hope he does her a favor and breaks up with her. She can find someone that isn't so manipulatively insecure, and a slut-shamer. I bet a lot of this has to with being a woman. And ugh, the entitlement! It's her business how long after she meets someone that she sleeps with them. Sounds eerily like those men that think consent once given means consent all the time. And for all that talk about her possibly being manipulative, OP is trying to pose like he's bothered about her lie more than anything when it's more or less clear (from the OP[ost] and subsequent comments) that it's the number and her ""easiness"" that's the problem. Yeah, I hope his GF is rid of him.  "
"She’s a grown ass woman though. I’m sure she’s fully aware of the risks. She never hid her past or that she was comfortable with hookups. Of course being tested is imperative. But outside of that, what’s the relevance of her personal feelings toward hookups if she’s in a monogamous relationship? Just seems to point back to insecurity. "
"She is truly 20 years older than him... I changed the ages around and neglected to adjust the math accordingly. :P

Thank you for your comment, though, because you're right- there's nothing terribly different about this situation compared to others, with the exception that he's never been to a concert alone with a woman before. He has had occasional issues with controlling alcohol intake but I don't know if he's drinking tonight- this *is* something I have trust issues with, though it's the only thing. I think I'm less jealous and more upset that it didn't even cross his mind to run it by me. I would have said yes. He's always made it clear that he appreciates when I run things by him. Also, I'm an incredibly stressed medical student. I'm sure that's contributing to my irrationality haha."
"He will not cut her off, the fact that he thinks his relationship with her is okay and what he’s doing with you is healthy is NOT OKAY. He’s disrespecting your boundaries and you, if he truely loved you and wanted to make you happy he wouldn’t be doing any of this. Don’t stay with him and make the same mistakes as me bc our situations are really similar. Except my ex KNOWS it’s weird and wrong, but he loves the attention she gives her and I realised that and I’m cutting him off and removing him from my life, so so should you."
"I don't care that she has a history, I have a history as well. I don't want any of my previous lovers around and I don't want any of her's around either. 

We've done great as a couple for 3 years without this guy. He is not needed. His presence is already causing tension. "
"So you knew this was a bad idea but bought the apartment anyways. Now you’re having issues and you don’t want to leave.

You walked right into this situation for a deal. And I don’t think you got that good of a deal considering the condition of the apartment.

"I've been struggling with birth control side effects for the better part of a year, and especially over the last six months have been moody, irritable, and depressed. My normally high sex drive has all but vanished and I've been struggling with pain and anxiety as I put my body through change after change. I know it has not been easy on my partner but he has been so incredibly supportive. This week is my first period after changing my pill for the second time in 6 months and I had to stay home from work one day because my cramps were so debilitating. I was sitting on the couch with a heating pad while he got ready to leave my place for work in the morning and he was being so wonderful. Asking if I needed anything, reiterating that staying home was the right choice, etc. On his way out the door he reminded me that this was a hard step, but a step in the right direction (in the weeks since switching back my depression has been waning dramatically) which was motivating and true. Then he came back to say ""but that doesn't mean it's not hard! What you're going through is terrible and I never want you to think I'm downplaying it!"" I've literally never thought that, but the fact that he was so conscious of making me feel heard and understood meant everything to me."

"She thinks she’s protecting her daughter.

And she probably sees the ‘driving a wedge’ thing as a way to convince op to get rid of her snakes.

Fears like these are not rational. You can’t expect her responses to make sense to someone who doesn’t have the same fear.

I read OP’s description of how gentle her snakes were and how contained they are. I know she’s not lying. But I wouldn’t want to be around her snakes either. If she were my friend I’d probably make all sorts of excuses to not go there. And I’d be convinced it was dangerous no matter what she said to me. I know it doesn’t make sense. But that doesn’t matter to me."
"Thats really hard. I’ve had a small taste of that same situation in my [24M] own life. Im curious- what do you think would make her love you? I wonder if its something neither of you notice. You may know that there’s been a lot of research and discourse to the effect that men who are not winning in game of “status” and “competence” become unattractive to women, even if those women cant identify it happening. Its a serious diagnosis to be told by your woman that she would have you as a friend but not as a lover, but its exactly what to expect if you arent excelling in particular areas of life. I urge you to consider that (in addition to the other suggestions)  to redeem your image to her.  I reckon this will be downvoted for its psychologically gendered stance, but its really quite true across the board, and very possibly the key to your situation.  Pm me if you want to discuss more. "

Watch out dude you might catch a feeling. 
I feel for you. You’ll have to do the work yourself then. I wish I had better advice for you but that’s a good start.
"&gt;I guess see it as a matter of degrees or spectrum of engagement with other people vs monogamy.

Ah, see this is why I am fine with regular porn but draw the line at camgirls, etc - the element of *interaction* with another person is what brings it up to cheating, imo. Not the mere existence of another person - otherwise am I cheating when I watch Aquaman? Jason Momoa is very hot and I am definitely fantasizing about him."

"Op, this. This is a good depiction of what your so’s step mom may be feeling. I hope you read this. If she’s otherwise a nice lady, it’s probably her feeling like this commenter describes that’s making her act this way."
“I can’t tell you what I think I saw because I saw nothing since you did nothing but I was startled by you waking up while I was doing something suspicious”
"I think that’s a lot of judgement for someone you don’t know at all. There are plenty of people who would gladly take three hookups in two weeks but can’t make that happen. Plenty of unsuspecting men and women are dating them. They’re “normal” by those standards because they don’t have the attractiveness/personality? 

It was impulsive. So what? She got out of a meaningful relationship. Got broken up with at that. She can deal with it however she wants to. 

I just see a lot of demonizing when OP made zero  negative remarks toward her loyalty in the relationship. I’d spend less time judging and diagnosing adults with psychological issues based upon little to no relevant evidence if I were you! "
" I read up until he said he was scared to sleep next to you. Just let him go. The whole idolizing thing and then turning around and acting like you're cheating/dangerous sounds like narcissism.  
 So since he broke up with you, you should just let him go because if you let him back that shows he can do that kind of thing. "
Jeeez. Your ex boyfriend is a terrible person. If someone im dating said that I would be gtfo. That is not a red flag that is a bullet you must dodge

"Dude stop engaging with unavailable women. The way she treats her current partner is the way she would treat you if she ever left him for you, which isn't going to happen. "
Sounds like he is the one being shady 
"Is this a joke?

This reads like a very bad novel where the author makes no effort and everything is obvious.

Come on, surely you are smarter than this. You are acting like not just a fool but an old fool.

I bet he tells this girl stories about he is only with you till things work out for him. 

"
I'll have to try that.  The only time I can feel my separation anxiety getting out of control is when we can't hang out.  
So you're her affair partner and she's trying to put an end to it. Seems straightforward enough. 
"Oh my god. That is so freaking manipulative girl. Some things you DO NOT lie about. Dead family is one of those things. I was annoyed with him reading your story, but now? I want to Lemonade his ass. "
Christ we’re on reddit not Tinder.
"That dude is fucked. That's some twisted behavior. He was manipulating you.

He did you a favor by breaking up with you. Go get checked for an STD. "
"&gt;When we were broken up, he had slept with someone; I had not.

In the show, this was a huge iconic scene they had and the phrase ""WE WERE ON A BREAK"" was Ross excusing his hook up (which was HOURS after Rachel asking for a break) but there's a lot of debate on break vs break up technicalities. 

&gt;I OBSESSED over it, even though I knew it was irrational to be jealous of a one-night stand that he honestly regretted. I OBSESSED about the other girl friends he had hung out with during our break. It was awful; I felt awful.

It wasn't irrational. It's actually a very well known debate. Some people will think it's a huge deal, others will recognize the fault and will try to work past it, etc etc. But in the show, it wasn't just Rachel who was upset about it, a few other friends also threw it in Ross's face. 

Every time Rachel and Ross broke up, both of them would be jealous and acted immature around each other regarding those relationships. 

&gt;I realized a lot of it had to do with my self esteem &amp; self worth. I was in a bad place when we got back together

That's pretty much Rachel except she never really actually addressed it. 

Your past self sounds a lot like Rachel 

"
That was my first thought but she denied that. other than her vagueness she has implied and told me that us not talking is a temporary thing. Like she’s putting it on hold. I’m all cool with putting it on hold but just cutting me off it seems extreme. Idk. But I’m not in her shoes without my child lol
Are you overweight? Is the weight you are losing going to cause you to become seriously underweight? 
"Seriously, like what on earth did he think he saw?  A syringe?  Gun?  knife?  Sword?  Battle axe?  What could she possibly have had in that bathroom that made him feel physically unsafe or scared?  That would definitely have been a make it or break it moment.  Either you tell me what you are hallucinating about and we talk it out or I’m done.  And even done, I would still want to know.  It is just so bizarre."
"A surprising number of women do not go to the gyno, or talk about the stresses in their lives that make sex difficult. Women spend a surprising amount of time feeling defective. So much so that it becomes ingrained. 

I think you should be more supportive of her, without being pushy. The fact that she's willing to endure pain to have sex with you is, y'know, telling. 

The bigger question in my mind is why her pain doesn't seem to worry about her instead of your dick?"
I have taken psychology classes and he is absolutely projecting his emotions of not being trustworthy onto you. He may have had feelings for someone else or been texting someone else and wanted you to take the fall for something of this sort because it’s easier that owning up to the issue. 
"With something like League, or any hobby, the point of it is that it adds value to your life. If it is consistently a source of negativity in his life and he can't figure out how to play it without caring about winning/losing so much, then he shouldn't keep sinking time into it. Sometimes it takes a little while for that lesson to sink in, and it sounds like you've talked about it all you can.

For your part, you are correct to think that this is basically a ""him issue"" and it is up to him to fix. For your part, you can vocalize your feelings, which it sounds like you have done a lot. And his response is basically, ""this is how I am and League is a big part of my life."" Okay then, you know your boyfriend has a glaring flaw and doesn't want to change. You can try having yet another big talk where you basically say that his attitude about league and stubbornness about playing even if he's not having fun are affecting your relationship and making you doubt being with him. He will no doubt get defensive and say this is part of who he is and you shouldn't try to change him, and then you're basically just looking at an endless loop of unhappiness.

If this is having a negative effect on you, try being around him less if he's going to be playing League, or even consider breaking up. Breaking up over a game is dumb, but breaking up over somebody consistently being in a shit mood that is easily avoidable is very not-dumb."
"If you want to patch things up you better have a game plan of what you are going to do to gain his trust back. (That is assuming he is going to want to make things work).  

As far as telling him, you do just sit him down, tell him and then give him space to digest the bomb you drop on him."
"Unfortunately, your friend pulls the trigger on this one. She might take your orientation seriously and distance herself, or she might look past it because she values the relationship. If she’s mature she’ll probably do the second, otherwise she’ll do the first, and as hard as that is, it would be a statement of her immaturity and a reason for you to move on. "
I've often found that if I have some hobbies and goals and do stuff with friends it helps to make me less dependent on my partner and needy in my relationships.
I'm so worried what he'll do after.
"Yup, you're a fool.  Sorry man, just getting that out of the way.

She wants a break so she can bang other guys.

&gt;She... did coke for the first time ever with a different guy. I'm suspicious. But she tells me that nothing more than talking happened.

LOL, If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you, right by some oceanfront property in Nebraska.  

You've also got her on a pedestal.  She's moving on and you're not, but you need to."
"It was a short trip and she already met my family and came overseas twice last year. 
I offered her to come but wanted to spend it with her family since we will be moving to the other side of the country next summer "

Restraining order now
This is my thoughts exactly.
You shouldn't judge your partner for their past.
"Sorry, but I've gotta be blunt. There's just so much disfunction happening here - what are you afraid of losing? "
Punching inanimate objects and screaming are uncontrolled anger that will lead to violence. Why would you stay with a partner that scares you?
"Yes, no"
"Okay so the book is called ""
Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother's Will to Survive
Book by Stephanie Land""

Not sure if it's on Kindle, I would imagine it's somewhere digitally though. That is a tough situation though, maybe her story will give you some new ideas for how to move forward though. "
"It sucks! Happens so often, can’t say I am perfect, of had issues with alcohol, but lately, it’s been happening a lot with him, i feel you. It’s hard when you love 2 different people. (In the same body) the worst part is he thinks I have cheated in the past/is insecure about it. :/"
Borderline personality disorder. Look it up. Just went through 18 months of this same crazy bullshit with a man. 
"This has to be the most infuriating relationship post I’ve ever read.  I am so sorry you had to deal with that shit.  Your life will be so much better without him, enjoy your friends, get out there, and be free of that burden of a human."
Can you mayne try working this out with an involvement of a 3rd party? Like a therapist. Figure out why it's important to her. Were they friends the whole time?does she want to be friends now? It might be that what she really needs is for them to catch up and get some closure. 
"Sounds like things are going fine, just ask him to hang 1 on 1 somewhere. :)"
"Just like a few other people have said, please find some better friends. You're being harrassed and  instead of being supportive of you, they're acting like it's no big deal.

It's time to call the campus police before this escalates more, this man could be dangerous!"

"&gt;""THe last few days at my new job have been diffiecult, and moving here has been an adjustment, I'm just not ready to date. I hope you understand.""

How are you finding any ambiguity in this statement whatsoever? The woman said she is not ready to date and she hopes you understand. That is an extremely polite and final way of saying she is not interested in you and she does not want to go out on any more dates with you, without her having to come right out and say she is just not into you. It is inappropriate to follow up and you should not take any more advice from the friends who told you to do that."

Disable the doorbell and DON'T ANSWER when they knock like lunatics during these hours.

If they come over and try to nose in while you have company, stop them at the door and tell them, ""we have company, we can catch up later"", then close the door. DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR AGAIN.

"It sounds like he was desperately trying to find a way out and cover up his own behaviour. His unwillingness to communicate over you about this apparent inciting incident is not your fault, it makes him look completely insane. He sounds like a complete child and that as confusing and hurtful the whole thing is you've dodged a bullet. Let him go, block him where needed, and don't give him any time (especially if he was cheating and fucks that one up and tries to come crawling back)."
"Something is way too fishy about that behavior. As much as I don’t want to say this I think he was looking for an “out” (as your friends told you). If that behavior isn’t normal, there is definitely something else going on in his life that has triggered it. I hope everything works out, you do NOT need someone like this. Time heals all. "
"Since you said your relationship was strong to a point of marriage and the fact that you guys have even met eachothers family says you guys were in a solid place...
In every stage of a relationship there are limits to what it can withstand whether it be trust issues, family disputes or even something tiny as ""did u take my last French fry""
The point I'm trying to make is... U guys were in a stage where you guys could have overcome all of those things you mentioned above, but since he isn't upfront with what is bothering him, he is clearly hiding something big, which sounds like he wants to drop this relationship for... you did nothing wrong..."
"I’m so sorry to hear about this, it sounds terribly stressful. I’m inclined to echo those in the comments who think he may just not be well. It sounds like he might have had some serious change in the state of his mental health and became unstable as a result. Additionally, he may have been cheating. A third option could be that both are true. Oftentimes, people with Antisocial Personality Disorder can hide their negative behavior for quite some time, although this relationship sounds longer-lived than would be typical. It might also be some kind of psychotic break. Given the paranoia, that seems like a decently likely option. 

Don’t beat yourself up over this. You’re not at fault for his decisions, and (unless you’ve left out some important details) you’ve done nothing wrong. Give yourself some time to grieve and experience the feelings of loss you have right now. It’s OK to feel sad when a relationship ends. That being said, it’s also very important to do productive and proactive things to keep your own mental health. My advice, and take this with as many grains of salt as you need, is to pick a set date around 1 week from now when you’ll stop mourning and start doing things to move on. "

"What a fucking asshole. I refuse to believe that she is doing this solely out of fear for her daughter's safety. I think she's doing this as some weird power play. She either has a problem with you or with your bf, or there is something else weird going on."
She broke up with you a week ago. You're not a changed person after a week. Leave her alone. She broke up with you. Respect the decision and work towards improving yourself. 
"Can't help wondering if he's hiding a drug problem from you. I had a guy get all paranoid on me when he was doing crack. My other thought was schizophrenia. Whatever, he's nuts, poor guy. You're better off without him."
"Thanks again for the reply. I really do appreciate it, I'm wanting to get better I just never knew how bad my behavior and mood actually was. I have appointments to see therapists and doctors to improve my mental help within the coming week. But I doubt I'll find anyone better, she still is the best person I have ever met."
"&gt; So, anxiety actually gets worse the more you feed it; when you jump in to reassure his anxious feelings away (and when your BF asks/lets you do so), your BF never gets the chance to actually process them himself, and strengthen his coping mechanisms. Like a muscle that atrophies without use, the more he turns to external 'fixes' (you), the less he'll be able to function by himself. This is, of course, hard to balance, because you do want him to be able to discuss things and bring up concerns with you.

This is great advice about anxiety in general. I wish there was someone around to tell me this when I was in my late teens and early 20s. It would have helped me to get through that period of my life more easily. "
"My comments have helped some people; a good number have said they needed the tough love.

"It’s less that your wife is doubting marriage after a week, and more that a 22 year old is doubting a 2-year relationship that has suddenly changed... I’m not saying these things never work out but that’s a pretty fast marriage for your ages.

That being said, you obviously can’t turn back time. So give her a little space to gather her thoughts and feelings, then have an honest talk about what you both want to do. If you want to stay together, get your butts into therapy and put the time and effort in. If you don’t, you may be able to get an annulment at this early stage to spare a divorce - which will suck either way, but you will both get through it. "
"This is exactly what I said about my abusive ex (it did not get better), and exactly what everyone I know who has been abused said initially to justify their abusers behaviors (they didnt change either)."
"This sounds so crazy to me! It really sounds like his behavior is completely off the wall for no reason. Causing unwarranted issues/arguments and jumping to breaking up. I'm gonna say he's got serious issues to work through, or he's cheating and projecting, or he's just trying to end the relationship. None of these are mutually exclusive BTW. But I'd say you dodged a bullet. Don't chase it. Good luck to you! I hope this won't weigh on you too heavily or for too long!! Sending love your way ❤️"
Tell her what you realized was ruining the relationship.
"Leave her alone, my god. If she gives you the time of day at this point, she shouldn't."
"My advice is going to be a bit different. I think everyone is more primal and animalistic during sex. They don't think cognitively as much. If this was me (I'm a woman so I'd be you), then I would take control while having sex with him. Rather than him ""performing,"" it would be me taking what I wanted. If he started to say things about himself I'd grab him by the hair and tell him to shut up, then continue taking. This would cause a basic psychological change in dynamics, and he wouldn't feel as much pressure. "
You’ve never had good days with this man. Everything is tainted by his lies and you’ll never be able to trust him (nor should you). He’s a messed up dude who enjoys playing games. Block and move on. 
"&gt; Is she really that concerned about not bringing anything

Does she usually feel the need to have an impromptu potluck when she comes to your place? Or is this abnormal? "
"I'm not sure it even matters whether you're overreacting or not (spoiler: you are not). What matters is that you feel smothered, you're constantly annoyed by him, and when you're already feeling down he makes you feel worse. Not to mention the fact that he's constantly interfering with your ability to do your job in your workplace and make a living.  


A lot of times people think they need a specific reason to break up with someone, but fundamental incompatibility is a really good reason in general. You don't need a better reason than ""I am unhappy in this relationship and my partner is unable to give me emotional support when I need it."""

I'm definetly not good at coming up with something that stupid
"""Block him on everything""
Lmao...girl... He doesn't even follow me"
"Why the fuck should a 24yo woman even consider having her perfectly healthy teeth ripped out and replaced with fake ones for the low low price of $1200 per tooth, just because a dude thinks they look weird? Jesus Christ.

She has no problem with her teeth (that we know of, OP said he thinks she's self conscious, but he could just be projecting that), why is your advice for her to get cosmetic surgery?

OP, either deal with your girlfriend having teeth that aren't perfect or dump her and find a woman who's teeth you can stand to look at."
Yup me too. I have never cheated but most of my partners have cheated on me. 
"Man, I understand love makes us blind but......girl. Come on. Wake up. :/ I am saying this as compassionately as I can. You are deluding yourself. "
"Some people can struggle to take hard truths... 

You haven’t done anything wrong - I think maybe she just wanted someone to vent to and the support she got from you wasn’t what she was hoping for. From reading what you put I get that you were trying to be really supportive of her but it seems as though she’s being defensive because it’s regarding family. 

If it were me I’d ask if I’d crossed a line at all and if so, for her to explain what has upset her. It’s not fair of her to just cut you out. Yes, she upset, but her reaction isn’t helping... "
"You need to leave. Every minute that you stay with her is another moment that your children are learning that emotional abuse is ok. 

Document her behavior. Call a lawyer. "

"Most of the time i can come up with a solution myself but then again, shes not really helping with the response shes given me. And seeing how good of a mood she had yesterday, it surprised me that it went from 0 to 100 so quick. "

"Um, the potential of him projecting because he was the one cheating would be the most normal thing about his behavior. He implied that when you woke up to use the bathroom that YOU HAD INTENTIONS OF HURTING HIM. That is absolutely batshit insane behavior. I'm sorry that you are hurting, but you literally were dating someone with a mental illness they were able to hide for some time or someone who is going through a psychotic break. Yikes, I'm glad that he has no interest in being in contact with you for your own sake, dude is nuts."
"To me that would be a dealbreaker regardless of how long I've been with someone. 
"
Maybe you’re forgetting that abuse can mean more than just physically hurting someone. Emotional and mental abuse are extremely real and common and it seems to me that is likely the situation. OP is still valid in being afraid of this person. 
"Haha I think we have the same name :) Mine ends with “-ina” but gets confused with “-ine” or “-ie” all the time. Honestly, it seems like an understandable mistake. 

I dated a dude for 6 months once without ever knowing his last name. Sometimes it just doesn’t lock into the brain unless he has a reason to use it often enough. We hardly ever use last names with those closest to us, so it’s an “embarrassingly” easy mistake for him to make. 

And getting the birthday wrong after just a year isn’t that bad. He actually wasn’t that far off. "
"Thank you! We have been looking for outside help, but it’s actually surprisingly hard to find it. I might try and have her ask student services at her school what they’d recommend. 

I think a huge issue is that she wants counseling/psychiatric appointments, but is struggling to get them. Tack on depression and she often struggles to find the motivation to keep looking or to do the things that would help her the most. "
"Stress can make one very ill. Indeed, not always the obvious cause in sight. The body has some powerful signs to tell you something is not going right in life and you should fix it, but it's not always as easy to recognize the right path to the solution. 

Take care of you, OP. "
"If you're going to start a relationship just to have a woman ""cook and clean for you"", and you're not interested in even that, I wouldn't bother with it yet.

You should start a relationship with someone who makes you happy, makes you better.  Not just a servant to cater to your whims and expect to be provided for in return.  We call our spouses ""partners"" in the US because that's what a healthy relationship is - a partnership. 

Find someone who makes you think you can take on the world together, who is open and honest and makes you smile, and shares the same general goals of home and family.  Most importantly, take your time.  If you're not feeling it yet, don't force it.  You will know when you have met the right person."
"I’ve definitely seen this, and understand this to be a thing. This can most definitely be a part of the disconnect that I’m talking about. 

I myself have been working in an office setting for 4 years though; I’d expect it to happen to me. Not that I want it to though. The idea that all professionals have a mask on just to move up the ladder sickens me. But whatever, that’s just the way the world works 🤷🏻‍♂️ maybe that’s the issue right there lol"
"You don't.

You respect her as a human being and respect her choice. That means that you don't try to win her back.

It is immature to think that you can

* recognize all your faults
* fix them and a week
* have everything perfect for her so that she will stay with you in that weeks time.

I applaud you for trying your darnedest to figure out what went wrong and learn from it, but that learning will be applied in your next relationship, not in this one.

Also, it is important to be yourself in any relationship. Getting back with her right now is about lying to her about who you are. ""This is what you want, so this is what I will show you"" is what you are doing. That is not a recipe for a good relationship. If she does get back to you, eventually, you will slip back into how you were before, because right now the best you can do is pretend."
He is insane so it's not a loss
OP should invest in a carbon monoxide detector. /s
Plz update when you find out what happened to his mind
"1. He's been cheating on you and was scared you were doing the same/wanted an excuse to leave you for someone else.
2. He's ridiculously paranoid and genuinely thought you were trying to murder him/cheat on him.
3. He's been getting cold feet and looking for a way out and this seemed good enough. 

The fact that he took his stuff and ghosted you for a bit does suggest he knew it was over before you got annoyed and called him out on his behaviour. Whatever the cause he's been super rude and immature about the whole thing. Just call it quits on trying to figure it out. I doubt he'll be mature enough to say anything and it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong"

"Two yeses, one no. Both people need to agree on it, one person can absolutely have veto power."
Was pornography even affecting your life negatively? 
If you go by a nickname and rarely by your name it's understandable. I honestly didn't know the middle name in the first year... The last i get it very easily. Just test  important moments if he don't remember something is bad...
"If you are breaking the law inside the apartment they live in as well, id find it considerate to tell them. If weed is legalized whre you live in, or you do it elsewhere, it shouldnt matter at all. Neither does your sexuality."
"Oh man, I know what that's like, when I was younger I always seemed to attract these kinds of people (still do, but I handle them differently now). As others have suggested, be less available and less responsive and be ""too busy to hang out"" a lot. As far as the multiple texting (35?! that's insane), let her know that it's not okay to text that many times in a row and that it stresses you out when you are trying to get things done. She will eventually get the hint, but it may take quite awhile and will take you firmly holding boundaries in place.

As far as the anxiety, I totally get that as well. You feel bad for her and feel bad you don't feel the same way about your level of friendship. But, remember, all of us are only given one life to lead and we owe it to ourselves to invest only in relationships that enrich our lives. That doesn't make you a cold or bad person. You'll become more comfortable with this as you get older and life gets busier and crazier (not to say a student's life is not busy or crazy, it just becomes a different form with career, family, friends, etc)."
" I understand you feel guilty because you’re doing better and she’s not, but that’s something out of your control. While you can try and get her outside and do some activities, and the end of the day it’s her decision whether or not she wants to make the effort. I’d suggest that you be patient with her while still working on yourself. Definitely encourage her to seek outside help but don’t force it bc it might make things worse. I wish the best of luck to the both of you!"
"Agree with everything. Except that she 100% did something wrong by lying to him about it. Just because you are not proud of something doesn't mean you get to lie to your long term partner about it. Would it be ok if she cheated and wasn't proud of it so just lied to him? It also seems like she didn't come clean on her own, but was due to her friend. 

Trust is the foundation of a relationship, and he just found out she lied to him about something pretty important. I'm not sure what difference the gender makes. If a guy lied pretended to be a virgin to a girl would that be ok? "
" Who knows what is going on on someone else's head? I haven't asked it directly (yet). My understanding of OP's post is that he feels disconnected from his peers and the child/adult dynamic is felt under the impression that adults are serious people worried fundamentally about family and children and taxes and similar aspects of daily life, instead of artistic purposes.

In my case for instance, I feel like a foreigner in my own native place. It may be slightly different, but the feeling of being disconnected is there.

I have been asked where exactly I am from, though."
"Although I would have said is a bit more nicely, you do need to stick up for yourself.  She sounds like one of those people who is just alpha.  Plain and simple.  When she ‘acts up’ take a deep breath and stick up for yourself.  As I tell my girls (one of whom is in college) “sometimes bullies bully until they are bullied back”.  Don’t let her treat u like crap.  You can do it!"
"Flowers, dinner, a weekend getaway, go on a hike, shout out how much you love on top of a mountain... 

Hell-- if she's been as kind and patient as you say, think about moving in together or proposing. She's sounds like a keeper. "
"It sounds like you need new friends. Many jobs these days are gotten through connections, family or otherwise. And while nepotism got you in the front door (along with your university degree), it's hard work that has kept you there. Your friends are jealous and dragging you down. "
"&gt; I don't actually think he's cheating

Sweetheart, here's the tell:  he gave you the unasked for reassurance.  He told you, without being questioned, that nothing happened with this undergraduate.

And as everyone else is asking:  if nothing is going on, why did he leave his watch at this woman's dorm room?  Why on earth did he take his watch off?"
"I appreciate what you're saying, but I don't know if it applies in this situation. The boyfriend has identified being ""bored"" as the reason behind his reduced intimacy, which is something that can happen independently of any changes to appearance. 

I also believe that couples who are in it for the long haul should prepare for the inevitable changes to a person's appearance that happen over life, and I don't think that anyone should feel ashamed of their own body, but I also personally believe that the ""it's just 20 pounds"" mindset can backfire a bit, honestly. 

20 pounds is a fairly significant change in weight, and it's not something that can be fixed overnight - one of the biggest discouraging factors for people who attempt to lose weight is the disappointment of how long results take, and I feel that downplaying this change in weight increases the likelihood of this disappointment occurring.

Just from my own perspective, I'm a man who's pretty large in general, over six feet tall and in decent shape, and if I gained twenty pounds it would be close to a 10% change in my overall weight. 20 Pounds would put me into noticeably overweight territory, I would have to change most of my wardrobe to accommodate this new size, and it would indicate that my lifestyle had undergone a change. 

I'm saying this not to attack OP, I fully believe that she is deserving of feeling good about herself and to have a supportive partner who is attracted to her, but the reality is that this may not be a subtle or minor change in appearance. Regardless of the impact on her relationship, *if* OP wants to lose this weight for her *own* sake and it is healthy to do so, I feel it is important to recognize that it will require a commitment to moderate changes. "
"Woahhh. Blowing my lid back.

I don’t want to admit it, but both of these are definite possible reasons for weird communication. And I’m torn as to what the answer is.

I feel like it could be a mixture of both. I’m not some stoney dude; I run a pretty tight ship when it comes to my personal and professional life. But because my life path has been a little different than most, it has led me to have to keep tabs on who’s doing what and where I need to be professionally to keep up with those around me.

I’d say more but I feel like I’d be going off topic for this sub-reddit and/or post.

You definitely put a seed in my head with your comment though. Thanks!"
"Do you keep in contact while you’re at uni? (Text/social media). Maybe he feels you have ‘left him behind ‘. Even if he doesn’t respond keep sending him small messages, memes and what not. 

Considering his age I imagine he will be taking his exams soon, possibly he is feeling stressed/depressed?

When I was 15 and then my younger brother neither of us blanked the other for no apparent reason, I reckon there’s more here than meets the eye.

Hope you get it all sorted out."
Screaming and being a b*tch isn't setting boundaries. 
Hopefully he wises up before his gf leaves him but I hope the gf leaves him for her own sake. She deserves so much better. 
Is it emotionally fulfilling for both of you when you do spend time together? 
thanks for the advice
I do too. I think her bf is likely to cheat on her and lie about it. 
"He's 15..he;s acting like a normal kid

When he is ready, he will reach out to you"
He may have ROCD  - a form of OCD which the person obsesses over their relationships. Sounds like it could be something like this which ultimately will only get worse the more he is reassured and needs immediate therapy to get better. 
"hey thanks for your response. And yeah, it actually does resonate.  Also taking into account, not to generalize or be ageist, the fact that he's in his mid-40s, and he's originally from the UK.  Not saying ALL dudes that age or from the UK are like that, but i think it's also a cultural thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

It just sucks. I owe him nothing. I'm a good, respectful friend. Also the fact that he is the one who ended things back in 2016, and now he thinks he's being owed my affection or sex?! Why, because I crashed at his place and I owe him that in currency? F that. Not sure if I feel comfortable staying at his place again. 

&amp;#x200B;

thanks."
"hahah yeah look I was hesitant even going for it in the first place, and there’s no way I’m even looking in that direction again. It’s just too hard when you see everyone several times a week. Feels like high school would have been if I went to a co-ed school.  thanks for your advice and listening to what I have to say :) "
"&gt; He also was on the outs with his siblings

Maybe because they're sick of his behavior? I'd bet $1000 he told his new gf you also cheated on him. "
"Did you use a nickname for your last name, too?  "
"Sorry bud, but #4 is just... not correct. Parents disown or mistreat their gay kids constantly."
"When you invited a small group of people, I’m assuming you’re closest with them, right? Hopefully you’d be comfortable with directly telling them not to invite anyone else, regardless if it’s a mutual friend, because you’re not feeling up to hosting so many people that particular night and you would like a chill night.

I think most people understand how draining it is to host large groups at your house. Just specifically ask them not to invite anyone else for that particular night and then they won’t invite all those other people.

Then the next time you host a larger event, personally invite or send a group message to all the others so they understand that you still want them around. Try not to do the word of mouth invites for these events because then some people might think they were only invited indirectly. A direct invite, even if it’s just a group message from the host, is always reassuring that the host wants you there."
"I didn’t see the “last name” part of your post when I replied, but no.

That said, I once dated a guy for 6 months before I ever knew his last name. It just didn’t come up one way or another. It’s unusual, sure, but not that insane. 

How often do you call someone by their last name anyway? "

"I hear you.

It sounds like the resentment goes both ways. You might resent each other for different things, but both stem from the way you feel that your parents have treated you.

What are you hoping to get out of this? To shut your sister down, or to get to the root of the issue?"
"If it makes you uncomfortable, it makes you uncomfortable, but it seems a little silly. He doesn't associate her with that stuff, so why not get over it?"
He probably can't separate the emotional intimacy of friendship without also wanting sexual intimacy so he's pulled back.
Yes. It was affecting our sex life. I was so addicted that I sometimes chose it over her. And doing it at work would get me terminated immediately so it was most definitely messing my life up. 
"Some people are okay with porn some people aren’t. Some people are okay with some types but not all types of porn. Personally I’ve never been a big porn person because I’m like 99 percent asexual. 

If you’re curious as to why a lot of men watch porn then I suggest reading a post on /r/redpillwomen which is titled: gor women only-men are visual -chapter 7"
The only person who can answer this is the guy u have been seeing. 
I was in this position and unfortunately tried to make things work for 3.5 years. My personal development and mental health was an inconvenience to him if it meant I had to see him less. There were so many other abusive traits but this one made me feel so suffocated and stressed out for far too long. I will never put myself in that position and I hope you never do either. 
"Eh, maybe he'll be able to later, after he gets ahold of his feelings or finds another outlet for them. But maybe he needs to establish some separation for a while to do that. Sure, it sucks to ""lose"" a friend for this reason but that's life sometimes.

"Also there's an excellent book called The Rabbit Back Literature Society, about a cult like group of authors and how they pull character traits from everything and everyone around them. I'd highly recommend a read. Pretty much every character is based on something or someone, to varying degrees."
"One of the common characteristics of a “nice guy” is that they can never be at fault. It’s against their own mental image of themselves, so once they decide they want to break up - owning responsibility for their own needs and potentially hurting someone - they instead set their partner up to make mistakes until they can break up and make it your fault. I don’t know if that’s what happened here, but his behavior is just bizarre, otherwise. "
"Did you read her posts?  I know that emotional abuse exists, of course.  But she has posted about this guy many times and never mentioned abuse.  She describes an asshole.  She describes their arguments.  Commenters respond by telling her he’s a loser and she should break up with him. Again, the only post she deleted is one in which she complains about him using baby-talk.  "
"Okay, but...after A YEAR of dating to have no idea what her name is?  How does someone with a memory that bad hold down a job?"
"where do you live that most are human trafficed? the middle east?

"I mean, I’m all for being cautious with most of these posts, &amp; I am a little confused why prev violence wasn’t described, but in the case of this person is a genuine victim (which they well could be, they may have deleted prev posts, ommitted details/been in denial), this is not the way to talk to someone. You have no more information than anyone else. They never said the arguing was abuse, they literally said ‘violent nature’ which I don’t think anyone is expected to believe was related to the other stuff."
Thank you for saying that!
"IMO nothing wrong with porn..IDGAF if my husband watches it.

As long as it doesn't mess up your sex life, I see no issues

You have NO say in his masturbation habits , nor does he with yours. He happens to use porn and it's ok

Don't be so insecure about it and not make a big deal

You can feel anyway you want, if it's a deal breaker then break up,if not then let it go

Trust me there are a lot of women who don't mind porn or the fact their SO watches/uses it"
"If you find a cumulative decent answer, let me know! 

Also, I dont know if this is innapropriate, but if you're anywhere near I am and want to take a walk sometime like midday on the beach or something, DM me. Hope it's not weird, but my girlfriend and all of my friends dont like going out, so I felt compelled to add on 😅"

"Good on you, OP. Seriously. Until one has been in position of having to leave an abusive SO, it’s very difficult to look in from the outside. 

You are worth it. Always. And don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, in any shape or form. 

All of the kudos aside, please file a police report in the event he bypasses your neighbourhood security or thinks of finding you elsewhere. "
I kind of want confirmation that the way she behaves towards me is wrong I guess. 
Why are you being weird about telling him your last name and making him guess? 
"Not sure if I'm misunderstanding you, but I struggle to see why it's relevant that she was jobless?

"&gt;My friends all think he was looking for an out 

Ding ding ding.

Some people have real problems with knowing how maturely end a relationship. 

It's hard to say what is the ""best way"" to end a serious relationship, but it's certainly not the way he handled it.

It's very difficult to see it now, but this immaturity at handling grown-up decisions it's a really bad sign that he would have been a good life partner.

And he exhibited pretty bad gas-lighting behavior and borderline abusive. 

Good luck OP, hope you feel better soon."
Why are you discussing your sex life with your parents?
"Have you told your dad you would rather live full time with him and why?   Would he ask for a change in the custody agreement on your behalf?  At your age, your preferences would be a big factor to be considered by the court."
"You can't kick him out nicely. You have to say ""I don't care about your problems"" because that's the truth. "
"Under a year?! I assumed you had been dating like 18 months or multiple years from your description. Why were you picking out rings?! As you’ve learned, that’s way too short a time to actually know someone, because you’re still in the honeymoon “do anything to please each other” phase and you haven’t seen what each other are like once you feel safe and secure that you have each other and don’t need to make constant sweeping gestures to impress each other. 
And, because creeps can hide the crazy for such a short period. "
"I’d say, as long as you hadn’t made any commitment to her at this point, what benefit does it have to disclose it? My bf disclosed something similar to me after dating for a year, and it’s hard. You can’t resent him because, you know, he didn’t really do anything wrong except for be too embarrassed to tell you about some 1 night date that actually helped him realise he was falling for me. But none the less it doesn’t feel great knowing that. Even though I don’t want it to affect me, it does when I think about it. It’s had no negative impact on our future relationship, but when I remember the fact I’m still left with a negative association feeling. Don’t do it"
"Thank you for your input! I agree with all the points you made, great recommendations. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I think about making the choice to have other experiences, I think about "" the grass is always greener on the other side"" I worry that I would throw away potentially my greatest connection for something as silly as sex ( theres so many more pleasures in life)  Have you ever experience something like this? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I can meet 1000's of women throughout life. But outside of college, I cant imagine where I could meet a woman like this. I don't think it would be a good idea to date colleagues at work, I wouldn't want to meet women at bars, and even worse look online. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I have a fear that I may not come across a woman like her again she is truly 1 in a million. Maybe it took me typing this out to answer my own question.... \*feeling like crap intensifies\*"
Thanks so much. it means a lot that people are so willing to go out of their way to help me 
"Maybe it's my own personal/familial history or just having read up on too many stories about cheating/dishonesty but as soon as I read the word ""break"" I went back up to reread this for any red flags that might indicate that.

And yeah, I'm coming up empty.

The best thing I can suggest is that you two do, indeed, take a break. It sounds like she's had a lot of weight on her shoulders for a long time, helping you with your burden, and following the miscarriage, she just ran out of strength for it. I know it sucks for you - you probably feel like you've only been getting stronger the more time passes - but she probably didn't have a whole lot of herself left to spare, and the miscarriage (plus any other issues she might have been having) just swept her feet out from under her.

You should have a talk with her. Do *not* try to press her into coming back; that clearly isn't helping. But you need to determine what's meant by a ""break"". Ask her what she thinks of the idea of just living apart for a while, if the alone time will help her recover. Some people think a ""break"" allows free reign to date others. You should ask her if that's what she wants. Again, *don't* try to push too hard to change her mind if you get a bad answer for that. You can and probably should say what you think about it, how it makes you feel, but you can't let that undermine what *she* needs. 

Understand that there may *not* be any way to salvage this, that even if she does agree to *just* living apart without free reign to date or whatever, it might *not* fix things.

It really doesn't sound like you have much of a chance left to salvage the relationship, but the slim chance you *do* have is going to revolve around listening to *her* and making sure she gets what *she* needs.

And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. It's really shitty. But sometimes you can't un-break what's broken. So at least try to make sure that when you two clean up the pieces, you get as few cuts from the shards as possible."
"That's valid also. It's important to learn how to settle your differences. However, if it continues without any change I would stress it more with him. "
"&gt; she knew he’d talk to me about it

Jesus Christ, this is massively unprofessional and unethical.

Assuming that you are in the US, do you have any idea what kind of legal liability your husband is creating with this shitty behavior?!?

He is her BOSS. There is a power imbalance. He has legal rights to ask her about medical conditions that impact her work AS HER EMPLOYER. He also has legal obligations to keep her medical information private. Her pregnancy is legally covered under FMLA.

If any employee ever says, “I didn’t feel comfortable using my legally guaranteed FMLA benefits (or requesting an accommodation covered by ADA) because I knew that my boss would share my medical information unnecessarily,” your husband and any company he works for is completely fucked!!!

These boundaries aren’t just “different,” they are disgustingly unethical and borderline illegal."
"You are well rid of him. Seriously. Dickhead trying to gaslight you. Breathe, live, be happy without him. Good luck.
"
"I think you were maybe initiating convos or excuses too much towards the end (if it were me, I'd be a cold-hearted bitch and let him wallow in his own bullshit before I'd bend over backwards to get a line of communication open) but overall, your friends and reddit are correct. He was looking for an out and was grasping at straws doing so. Hes showing you his true self; believe him."
"&gt; Do spouses not usually share these details with each other?

No. Most supervisors do not share medical information about their subordinates with the romantic partners unless the employee has chosen to make the information common knowledge."
I'm not a lawyer so I cannot fully advise on that. It's just an idea that came to mind. It may be worth a try. The police will ask you questions about the circumstances and they'll be able to let you know if they can do that or not.
They've been together under a year. No proposing or moving in.

Its continued far too long in my opinion I'm going to talk with him in the next couple days again to just kinda tell him it's been too much
Name checks out. You are so fierce. I need more friends like you.
Met his grad school friends once or twice. Met his abroad friends once. He mostly hangs out with me. But there have been instances where I could have been invited to a birthday dinner. He says his best friends are the ones abroad.

"This isn't ""painfully insecure"". Not *once* in this entire post do I see *any* signs of you saying that *he* is putting *himself* down, which *is* a trait of insecurity. 

All of his ""insecurity"" is laser-focused on affecting *your* behavior. 

I'll take you at your word here and agree for the sake of this post that the core of this issue *is* insecurity. Well, the problem is that this insecurity has manifested as *abusive behavior.* Even though he's not trying to be abusive, *he still is.*

You need to wake up and get him to go to some couple's counseling or something because this is a *very* bad sign, and if it goes untreated, it *will* destroy your relationship.

Or it will destroy *you.*"
You shoukd cheat on him and tell him and say YOURE  WELCOME. If he's gonna be crazy just throw crazy right back!
I disagree with the people saying he is covering up an infidelity. He sounds mentally ill. No one would say such paranoid creepy things like fearing for their life unless something was off mentally. 
"Please don't judge yourself by Hollywood's standards. You present solid reasons for not being in a relationship up to this point. You are an amazing individual who deserves to be loved for who you are, and if you are looking for love you must first love yourself."
Have you tried telling your friends that you’re struggling and need support?
Consider yourself lucky. He sounds like he has a paranoid delusional disorder. I spent 6 years with a woman like that. It destroys your life and soul. Run and consider yourself blessed. 
"I’m not saying you’re wrong, but I’ve never considered pregnancy a medical condition. I mean it makes sense, I would’ve just never labeled it that way.

I’ve told bosses about some of my technically medical issues, like anxiety attacks, that I know were shared with spouses. It’s just never alarmed me. Maybe it’s time for some widespread training. "
Right. I’ve been wondering if he’s doing all of this because of my age. He expects me to be naive and forgiving. I’m so young and he’s ruining my 20s. So much negativity.
"It’s up to the individual if they can deal with seeing one another less. You shouldn’t feel bad for those feelings. Its also ok to go that long if you are both ok with it. It really just depends on the individual and what you are able to deal with. It’s one thing if you want to see them literally every day, but two weeks is a bit long for a newer relationship, so I definitely understand how you are feeling. 

However, a 45 minute drive is quite a long distance to be honest. I get why your partner may not be willing to see you as often under these conditions. I think your issues are more based around how far you are away from each other and it’s not really anyone’s fault. You want to see him more, but I haven’t heard much about how he is really feeling about him. First thing I would do is to ask him to honestly open up about how he feels and whether he wishes he could see you more and why."
I am screaming. This dude is a nightmare. You are so lucky he was crazy enough to leave. 
"1) Find a job, priority  
2) Start to workout - not sure on your location but find a cheap gym - if that's out of the question do some running / in-home workouts.. amazing for de-stressing  
3) Get over the EX before you even think about dating.   
4) Hang with your sister!  
"
Right on point!
"Pft, it's a name I came up with when I was like eleven because I thought the Fierce Deity Mask in Majora's Mask was the best thing ever. 

I'm not usually this blunt on this subreddit but in cases like this, when the OP knows what's up but just can't muster up the will to do the right thing, I think a strong push with a dash of humor is what works best. 

Plus, I really *don't* like cheaters. Too much personal and familial history with 'em."
"Why do you need to accept them?  If you don’t want these vices in your life, this is not the person for you. Time to end it. "
"Do nothing, obviously. She’s taken, and you respect that. It’s okay to like her, love her, befriend her, and keep your feelings to yourself. It’s also okay if you tell people. But as long as she’s happy with her life as-is, be happy for her."
"It sounds like you have some pretty intense problems you need to work through before you can ever be in a healthy relationship with a woman. I highly recommend therapy, do it for yourself and for the next girl you love."
"He's a narcissist and a cheater. Trust me, I have PLENTY of experience. Good riddance. Watch, a month or two from now he'll be begging you to take him back. He's so sorry!!! Or, he's genuinely a nut case. Either way, steer clear. He's not going to get better, only worse. Be glad you found all this out before the wedding. "
"Overall he sounds pretty mental. Also the whole silent treatment thing is just a pretty childish thing. Not sure if he suffers some sort of paranoia or was just being weird because he wanted out, but I dunno. Don'tthink there's anything you could have done. Also if this was how he was going to behave from here on in, just be glad it is over."
"The federal government considers it a medical condition, sometimes a disability, and a huge source of illegal employment discrimination based on one or more protected classes (family status, gender, etc). This is not something to mess with."
"Your BF can start by actually going to therapy or find ways to control his anger and not yell at you. Apologizing over and over again is not enough, especially since this happened a few times."
"If he’s lying to you now what’s going to stop him from lying in the future about bigger issues? He shouldn’t be hiding anything from you and more importantly he shouldn’t be lying. Everyone does things they’re not proud of or has a vice they don’t necessarily want to broadcast, but you don’t lie to your significant other about it. "
"If your friends are encouraging you to cheat on him it's obvious their opinions are worthless.

As for your boyfriend, they must be pretty serious for you to lose trust in him for MONTHS. If you want to salvage the relationship my advice would be going to therapy together. If he disagrees it's time to dump him.
"

You did absolutely nothing wrong. His anger is a means to gaslight and find fault where there is none. He is looking for an easy out. Byeeeee!! Don't play into his games don't react to them and then he can see how silly his behavior actually is.
Literally you should have bailed more quickly than I should have reading it.
Yeah it’s all about image so you can look like you do the right thing instead of actually doing the right thing
This reply is perfect.
Sounds like he had some sort of psychotic break if this behavior has never been present before. 
"It depends on if you feel she would handle any open communication. I have a similar problem with my SIL. But mine is a twister and manipulator and I refuse to say a word to her about any problems without my BIL present. Since she controls his communications with us and we can't seem to get together we just dropped them. I don't carry on any conversation through text or social media. I am cordial in a public setting but that's it. Nothing more. And a time or two in public settings my SIL has been extremely rude to me so I was rude back and went on about my business. 

So honestly I don't know. "
"There is so much to unpack here...
Your girlfriend is right in feeling hurt and betrayed, and probably creeped out. Let her be. You seriously need to work on yourself OP. Please, seek therapy as soon as possible. There is no way you can have a healthy relationship with your ex or any other woman with this mindset and these tendencies. "
Maybe he was embarrassed about it or didnt know how to bring it up and thats why he hid it
"That dude is batshit crazy. But tbh, I wish he had a Reddit account so he could post his side of the story. I'd be interested to hear that perspective"
"It sounds like you’re the target of a predator who saw your emotional vulnerability and took advantage of it. Or else he is actually deeply mentally disturbed and needs help, but you can’t be the one to take responsibility for his health when he won’t. "
What did a date look like when you were dating? 
"Mostly his stuff, or some mug that we share. "
She's a grown up. Let her make her own decisions.
"Thanks for the personal tale, is your wife and your life better now? Are you glad you didn't divorce her?

I got to be honest.  After all the fighting, all the name calling, what she has done emotionally to my kids already i kind of hate her. I don't know if i can forgive her let alone love her. She is my kids mom, i will always want my kids to have a relationship so i support her getting help but a lot of days i really want to get out and find someone who is fun, more like me, not nagging,  not cheap, not annoying or cursing who enjoys life etc"
"I probably exaggerated the “near-constant” part, but the nature of their work comes with explicit workloads and deadlines. She hasn’t missed any deadlines and hasn’t needed a decrease in workload. Any measurable sign of struggling is absent so far. "
"Google White Noise Audio Check, you will find a 15 min Long White Noise file which  you can play it on repeat with any music player"
I was about to say the same thing! This one is broken. Time to toss him and start fresh with a new one. 
"Will it take him slapping a post-it note on your forehead that said ""I'm cheating"" before you realize what's going on? At the very least he's using you as a meal ticket and keeping her in the wings in case your relationship goes South. "
"Trust me on this: you're going to come to literally *dread* sex with him. Once you dread being intimate with your partner, you lose attraction to them. Once you lose attraction to them, the feelings follow. Just get rid of this relationship now. Seriously. I don't usually jump to ""just break up"" but seriously..... just break up. You don't have to continue making a mistake because it was your first mistake, or you spent 5 months making it. Charlie is not a healthy partner. What will happen when YOU need support?"
"Can you list how your friends benefit your marriage?

You talk like he's going to be specially involved with your life moreso than any other person."
"Sounds like a real keeper, wow."
"This guy has an issue, not you. He is making it out, as if everything is strangely your problem. What the problem even is according to him, he does not even tell you. You are left guessing. Do not waste your time on these shenanigans. You did not do anything, you just went to the bathroom like a normal person. In fact it is the other way around and the only one in all these non-scenarios having a problem is him. Run for the hills, honey. And be very glad you dodged that horrifically manipulative bullet. "
"Damn. Juggling medicine and a relationship is a hard slog at the best of times. As an observation, perhaps being so laid back and easy going with each other might work against you once in a while. Trust is great to have, and you do better than many there, but sometimes it's so easy to assume that trust that he didn't think twice about it. It's too easy to take for granted. He was sure you'd have no issue with it and just went ahead. As we note, it's not much different to any other time, only your reaction is. Which suggests it's time to communicate a little when you catch up next, clear the air and remind each other that it would be great to have more than just some passive input (in the form of that implied trust) in each others' lives on these occasions."
"Okay so you need therapy, shitloads of it for depression and most importantly if you think handling your problems is by saving photos of the people you despise. That’s some Criminal Minds shit. It’s not a healthy way to deal with problems and it’s downright creepy (think about how those girls would feel if they knew some guy was hoarding photos of them. Or flip it, what if someone did something to you against your will or unbeknownst to you?). You’re not going to find a healthy relationship until you addresses your issues. Also you need to work on yourself before you get into a relationship with a girl who also has been burned in life otherwise it’s a shit show. How do you help her and support her in her time of need if you’re incapacitated or lashing out at her because of your depression? "
"Your justification or why you saved those photos of those girls sounds an awful lot like a justification a rapist would make. 

You don’t have to be a misogynistic monster. You can choose to see women as people. 

You can choose to see past your upbringing and realize that women are the backbone of society and the only reason you’re even on earth right now. The stork didn’t deliver you and they sure as hell weren’t the ones feeding you at 3 am. Or packing your lunches. "
"Nope, huge red flag. Notify a school official before it escalates further, and be safe! "
He’s seeing someone else and being weird. Move on. I’m so sorry.
"Its harder than it sounds man, my 8 year old cries in my arms not to divorce her.

Im in a big city no family, she controls most of our finances. Outside our family she acts normal. Everyone i talk to tells me not to divorce her, it will be to devastating for the kids. I am honestly so confused and conflicted.

I do want to just leave her. I do think she has a mental problem. I do worry about leaving my kids alone with her if i leave.

Its not as simple as just taking the kids and walking out unfortunately.

My sons birthday is this weekend. I think after this i am going to meet with a lawyer and come up with a concrete plan. Maybe take some time off work. Might try to plan it a little closer to summer so its a bit easier.

I really appreciate the advice but like say its just so many variables at play. Its gonna be a horrible court battle that is for sure. Thank you for replying. "
This is the shambling corpse of a marriage. You're not willing to stay and you're too afraid to leave. This is toxic for both of you. Shoot the zombie and go. 
Yeah but obviously the implication is that this may be the tip of the iceberg of forgotten things. 
He's got some serious issues. You are better off letting him work on them without you. Find someone who trusts you and respects your privacy.

How often is your real name brought up in your interactions with him? Do you remember how it was ever brought up in the first place?
"Does he remember all the other things? Like, does he remember details about you that are much more simple?"
"If he didnt want to have kids and now will have 2, I'm sure hes freaking out. He might come around or he might not, I don't think theres much you can do but wait and see, unfortunately "
He sounds very possessive and someone with real self esteem issues.  This is something I'd honestly recommend therapy for because there is nothing you'll be able to do to help him and hell like become even more jealous and possessive with time.
"I've been dating my boyfriend for almost 3 years and he just memorized my birthday. I used to make a big deal out of it but I realize he just forgets thing he even made an effort and wrote all of my favorite things, birthday, and show size on his phone. Have your boyfriend try this so that he'll remember better."
"The point where he does things that scare you, where he uses the threat of violence to control you. You're at the step right before the hitting starts. Don't stick around for the hitting, the fact that he's justifying terrifying you is the biggest red flag. Please don't ignore it. "
"Thankfully every consultant I've worked under is more than happy with my knowledge and performance, and I've had 0 complaints from my patients, so I'll take their opinion over yours."
"When I do it, I go beyond the ""reality"" as in I make myself say details out loud such as:

If I'm sitting at home and I get a wave of panic that doesn't go away within the first 5 mins I go 
""I am sitting down watching (what ever it is). My kids are ( in daycare, next to me, with my parents). There is nothing going on that I should be worried about, I am safe, my family is safe. This is going to go away and everything will still be fine"" 

Usually I HAVE to say it out loud. For some reason silence from actual voices kinda triggers something in me and I tend to freak out for no reason. So I also call someone (sometimes) just to hear a different voice other than my own that isn't from a video/show"
Thank you I hope so

"The emotional infidelity was in the first year of us dating. We are now in year seven of being together so it wasn't something that changed overnight but with time and so many fights. I think being really dissatisfied with our sex life or lack of, we decided that we would allow the option of sex with other people b/c at least that's one thing that can make the other person happy. Neither of us has actually had sex with anyone else yet though because it's scary (especially for someone like me who hasn't had much sexual experience outside of long term committed relationships).

I married him because he was my best friend, we loved each other, and we wanted to spend our lives together. We really thought we could make it work.  I feel like he's changed so much and I probably have to. He used to be this dominant, confident personality that I was so attracted to,  but now he's submissive and quiet and apathetic. The apathy is what kills me. And the fact that I don't feel like he's attracted to me although he says he is.



"
"It's just taken me long to admit I am worried. He's taken a bad turn after a bout of depression, and for the longest time I assumed it was just depression poisoning him. "
"Okay. First of all, did you know that by the age of 24, your brain starts slowing down? I think he needs to see  a doctor because if his family has a history of Alzeimer', he's doomed. Every 65 seconds, someone in North America is diagnosed with the disease. It's not necessary that old people will develop it. I'm not saying he has it but it could also be something else!

Maybe he's stressed out or something. But he needs to see a doctor. "
"No it’s a fictional book that you stole the plot from for your post down to the city the book takes place in, the surgeon abusive partner, the high school sweetheart opening a restaurant, the wine bottle incident and the wanting to go to Vegas to get married. Why someone would post a fake story about something as serious as domestic violence is beyond me. Wow. "

"Good lord it took way too long to find this response. As if OP can say ""Hey you can be my wife now that I decided to fight for you! Isn't that wonderful?"" As if women don't have the capacity of original thought and mean what they say. Like she left you dude, that means there was a part of her that doesn't love you anymore and *saying out loud that she ""really does I know it"" doesn't make it so.*  Its patronizing. That's the kind of guy I fear, the one that will not accept that no means no. "
"They've been dating one year. I'm curious how often he has any reason to see/hear/etc her last name? If she mentioned it once like two years ago and it hasn't had any reason to come up (it's not like he's staring at her driver's license regularly), when is the right time to say ""so, I don't actually know your last name?""


These things sound so obvious because they are so intrinsic to who you are as a person, but if two years ago, she said ""hi, my name is Jordy,"" and that's all, when would it ever come up?


Think about all your friends' last names. Most of my friends use their real last names on Facebook and I see them constantly, but if they didn't, who knows how many I'd know."
"&gt;he used to tell me my mom would come to him in his dreams to tell him how happy she was we found each other. He also told me how everyone in his life has hurt him. 

Both of these are huge red flags. Number one is just odd. Number two means that he is insane and runs everyone off."
Sounds like he legitimately hurt his head or something. No sarcasm. Ask what’s up and tell him he should see a doctor.
I think you need to consult a doctor about all of this. 
How did they test for that? I've never even heard of that happening. What antibiotics did they give you?
"&gt;On our last night there, I woke up around 5 am to use the bathroom. I think I must have been stirring and he asked me what I was doing and I said I had to use the bathroom. When I came out of the bathroom, he was waiting for me and asked again what I was doing. I didn’t think anything of it but when we got home, I had a hard time getting ahold of him. He was ignoring me or giving me one word responses to my texts. When I finally asked him why he was ignoring me, he told me I need to admit what I was doing in the middle of the night. 

&gt; I was not sleepy yet so I was playing around on my phone; browsing Reddit, social media etc. I also responded to a message from my girlfriend about a date she went on and another message from another girlfriend about a trip we are planning. He asked me what I was doing, and I responded “I can’t sleep so I’m on reddit.” I didn’t think anything of it. Well he told me that Saturday, he was reading my messages over my shoulder and he saw I responded to a message from one of my girlfriends and I lied when I told him I was on reddit.

Didn't read any further than this, he is crazy (colloquial meaning). Do you want to spend the rest of your life defending  yourself against a nutcase who doesn't trust you?

"What a dumb post.  He's not controlling.  He works 12 hour days in construction.

"Has he ever gone through a self esteem work book that focuses on learning to redirect the negative self talk into positive. There is one that's simply called the self esteem workbook and you can get out in Amazon for about 15 bucks. If his therapist hasn't already worked on good with him, I would question their credibility. Self talk therapy is one of the most fundamental and effective CBT therapies for anxiety and depression."

I understand that he was shocked at first but my suspicion that he wasn’t happy hurt a lot and hearing him confirm it hurt even more knowing that this whole time his smiles and supportive words was a act "

It sounds like you need to see a therapist for your very obviously unhealthy relationship with food. Your boyfriend can't help you here; it's clear that you need a professional. Going over a day without eating is not good.
Could she be having an affair? I would divorce her.
"That’s very generous of him but that will strain the relationship. That’s a lot to put on one person.

I get what you’re saying but you can’t ignore that he’s a real person too with real feelings just because they don’t make you happy. He isn’t just shocked, he’s probably devastated and tbh that isn’t uncommon or unreasonable in this situation. You’re upset that he puts on a brave face, but you didn’t give him much of a say in the matter and you’re also upset when he doesn’t hide it. What do you want from him? He isn’t going to be thrilled about it because it’s extremely life altering. Who will watch the babies when you go back to school? "
"I guess my question is did he ever truly know your full name? You mentioned you have fake names on social media, it would be easy enough to forget if he only ever calls you by a nickname. "
"“At the very least daily” uh ya, welcome to being a living, breathing human. 

You may think this is under the guise of your slow “metabolism and boredom” but your relationship with food, as mentioned above is not typical or healthy. Just because you *can* doesn’t mean you should. Especially if you’re not taking the necessary provisions to eat healthy and be active and are instead resorting to a caloric restrictive diet. 

See someone, stat. "
"Disclaimer: this is what I would do because I’ve been on the other side of this situation, to a certain degree. 
Disclose everything that went on with Jenna to Courtney. Then ask Courtney, when she’s done going through the texts, if you can delete the messages you exchanged with Jenna. I really hope she says yes to this because, I’m not kidding, it is freeing and when you have doubts, you just have to let it go because the texts are gone. There’s no going back- I t’s a great way to start over. Next, and this should be obvious, delete Jenna’s number and block her. Show Courtney that Jenna means nothing to you because Courtney means everything. Show her that Jenna has no control over your relationship with Courtney. 

It’s going to take her time to heal from your betrayal but I got through it so she should too. Be patient and kind with her processing. I hope this helps and you can work it out."
Well what are you doing about your OCD then? 
"It's definitely worth it. There's medical assistance programs and charities as well. This isn't relationship advice, this is health advice. 

Your SO is sharing concerns about your health and you refuse to seek help. "
"I like this advice.

Don't get into all the relationship drama.  Just state what happened as your relationship was ending, tell the dad you are worried about him, and don't question yourself on what you said or did while it was all going down.

I think ""he thought I was holding a weapon and was going to hurt him"" will either let the dad know that his son has issues or is lying to you.  "
"This is about ""things to work on"".  You are unhappy and are incompatible re: marriage.  There is nothing to work on due to that incompatibility."
 What does your doctor think about it? 
"I'm seriously a little concerned for your mental health right about now - dude is twisting you up and trying to gaslight you into his fantasy - whatever the HELL that is. This is a preview of what marrying this dude will be like.

So. Run. ASAP."
"Hang on, no. I don’t hang out with girls, I know it would upset her too much. On the pictures I think that’s fair depending on what the pictures are. I know I’m being at least a bit inconsiderate but at the same time it gets to a point where her emotions are unsustainable and she needs to fix them but refuses to. "

"My fiancé is a homebody who works a long physical job. But he still makes the effort to go out and have a date night with me every week or two, even if I know he’d rather be at home on the couch. And he doesn’t pout or whine or sigh or any of that childishness. 

This might just not be the guy for you. "
"God damn, she sounds like a horrible roommate, wife and mother. 


I cuss at my kid, when i get super angry.  This week for instance: he didnt write out a weather report about a blizzard, i lost my shit.  Then he closed down the program he was typing it in... i walked out and had a smoke, texted his dad on a rant like no other. 

Then he put his wet ass sneakers on my car seats because i told him to tie his shoes correctly.  I just let that boil in peace. 

What I'm getting at.. i can lose my shit occasionally, but its not often. 

I've never slapped him, i dont call him names, his father names, or anything like that. 


The last time we got into a battle: summer time.  He wouldn't come inside to shower and rest for school.  So, like 5 months ago?  

I'm rambling. 

I'm super passive aggressive but sometimes, my kid is a little asshole and absent minded, granted he's 8 and I'm 35. 

But i wouldn't live in a house that constantly being yelled at. That's how i grew up! Probably why im passive aggressive.   Ahh man, was that free therapy and awareness for me? 

Ok I'm done. 

Divorce, you're still young. 

Being a single parent is way better than your life

"Not really helping your case, buddy."
What kind of money does an amateur trail runner make? Does she have sponsorships or win prize money? I'm guessing you guys live somewhere cheap right now?
"It sounds more than just forgetting, it sounds more like a neurological blip. 

Even something as simple as a UTI can cause mental confusion and odd behavior.  Other things like hypertension, medication interactions or an illness that causes swelling of the brain (West Nile, encephalitis, meningitis) can cause odd behavior. 

I would definitely get checked out before taking him over the coals "
That uh...that comment about the mom would have me running for the hills. Totally creepy and delusional.
