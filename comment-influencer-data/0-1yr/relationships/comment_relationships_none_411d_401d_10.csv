"Honestly? You both sound far too good for him. She noticed how shit his behavior is, so if it makes you feel any better, she will most likely reject him. And he will have no one.

However, you will be fine. It'll hurt for now, but you'll move on and realize how worthless he really is. It'll become a story you look back on a cringe at. You just have to get through the now. "
It's going to suck raising two kids. 
"I know that this will mean nothing to you now but in 3-8 months when the reality of dating again sets in, accompanied by the existential fear of dying alone that everyone (yes, everyone) who was used to a ltr inevitably experiences: you have the most attractive possible background to people looking for a serious partner. You're not inexperienced but you have no problem with committing, you're young but not a baby, you're loyal, and you stand up for yourself and what you want.


Heck, that's probably the best  qualities a person can have in many situations, romantic or not.


It's like you took one of the most unpleasant courses in the world but then graduated with special honours. "
"My sister tells fantastic lies kind of like this. She's never invented a millionaire fiancé, but she has a whole story about how at age 14 she leapt into a flooded river to try to rescue a drowning kayaker, and another story about how she was doing sound for a famous band and in the middle of the show the lead singer stopped the show to talk about how beautiful she was.

I guess what I'm saying is that, based on my experience with this kind of thing, the person telling the lies is not exactly delusional but more driven by a pathological need to impress other people and to portray their self and their life as better, the best, just so amazing. 

I suspect your friend is having a fairly bad time and really, really does not want to admit that she's single and poor.

Of course I may be wrong and James may end up locked in her basement."
"Dear god...

Well, I guess if I were you my next step would be to bring him to an OB/GYN appt and have the doctor explain why the chores need to be temporarily swapped. But *wow* OP. I really, REALLY wonder how your husband is going to handle midnight feedings and such. "
Disinvite. You're not going to have any fun dragging a wet blanket around this event.
"Call up parents/girlfriends and pawn your kids off for two days to recover.   Ask them to pick up a couple of quarts of chicken noodle or won ton soup at the local Chinese place (if you add some hot mustard it will help with the congestion).  Do nothing but rest for the next two days.   When you are recovered, end this useless relationship.  Frankly, I wouldn't even talk to him anymore.  Get a help chain going that doesn't include him and then get rid of his selfish ass."
"I think it is perfectly logical and reasonable to give you the old car as it is still functional - you mentioned your parents aren’t rich, so why would they buy a new car when there is a perfectly good one you can have? It is not unfair nor sexist. Your parents seem sensible. You seem happy with the gift as well, so your boyfriend is being really entitled. Why does he care? I’m 20, and I’d be thrilled with a car, new or old. 

Edit: following up on my comment, I’d like to add that I totally agree with the other comments. The parents most likely knew/predicted the car would last for all children. The people suggesting it is still biased, might not understand how it is to grow up middle-class. Someone pointed out that older siblings often get newer items, but younger siblings (often) get to have more lenient boundaries and in cases, more time with their parents. It evens out. I’m the youngest in my family and my brother often gave me things that he previously used - I was just happy I was getting something and never cared about it being used. Imo the parents knew what they were doing. Insurance is cheaper and the total cost is much lower. I mean, what do you really need out of a car other than getting to a to b when you’re 18 and never had a car before? 

About your boyfriend: he needs to understand that getting a brand new car is not really that common (idk about the US, i’m European) - if I was her, I’d simply explain to my boyfriend that I’m really glad I got a car, and I’m glad you got one too.  I’m happy with my gift and that is all that matters."
"There’s a few things that strike me as odd... I’ve never heard of having to get a headcount to the caterer that early. My caterer needed a final number from me on the Tuesday before my Saturday wedding. 

Next, if he’s the best man, I’m surprised he’d insist upon a date anyway. Usually the wedding party is busy with a lot of other stuff so their dates end up spending a lot of time alone (and if people do a head table, they don’t even sit together).

I don’t think you’re being unreasonable by not wanting him to bring a “stand in” for you. I wouldn’t be comfortable with my husband doing that. "
"Contact the property manager again. And again. And again and again every time he blasts music until it stops. He's already been an asshole about it, so fuck his feelings. Keep making complaint after complaint to management until he either becomes a model neighbor or gets evicted. "
If you've never met him he almost assuredly doesn't exist. Your friend is either having some kind of mental health episode or is a pathological liar. You should probably make a small effort to find out which. 
"&gt;I really, REALLY wonder how your husband is going to handle midnight feedings and such.

I don't think you need to wonder. He's not. And then he's going to tell OP that she needs to stop dropping the ball on her chores and being attached to her child via boob all day is no excuse."
"Yes, you should have left him behind when you moved to your mom's. He is not a grown-up. I'm really sorry OP, but it's just going to get SO much worse when the baby comes. 

&gt;But if he leaves, I don't even know where he'd go. There's no way he's gonna find an affordable place with his shitty paycheck and lack of responsibility.

Don't worry about him, worry about yourself. Someone needs to since he isn't."
"You can't make them OK with it, all you can do is let them know what's happening, that you'd like them to be included, what your expectations are, etc. They'll either get on board or not. Ultimately adulthood is taken, not granted, and dealing with your parents as equal adults rather than some higher authority is a big part of that. Their acceptance or lack of it doesn't have to determine your life choices. It doesn't even have to be an ultimatum, but it may end up playing out like one, whereby if they persist in avoiding your girlfriend, then fiancee, then wife, they'll end up having minimal relationship with you as well. That's not you making them choose, that's just a decision they're making."
"I am actually sort of glad you didn’t answer your Ex’s phone call or return it. I cannot imagine, for the life of me, any usefulness to that conversation. 

I mean, did she not know anything about the department you were in at school? Or the likelihood of seeing you if she kept her dating pool there?

IMHO, you really demonstrated an ability to be above drama by not immediately telling your boss or Sara about your previous work/romantic relationship. 

And i’m super stoked that, instead, you just focused on work and got praised by your boss boss. Good for you! "
Sounds like she's somewhere on the Autism spectrum.  
"Your boyfriend is trying to throw salt at your family and make you have bad feelings toward them. It sounds like you have a solid understanding of what is actually going on and thus aren't easily influenced to feel malice toward your people. Tell him Look my dude it's not like that at all, you've got the wrong idea please drop it.

He'll let it go if he has some sense. If not let him go because someone who tries to start an issue within a family where none exists is BAD. NEWS. 

I've got 3 kids with similar age spacing (nearly 6 years between oldest and middle, then 3 years between middle and youngest). My oldest did get new things that were passed down, but the youngest has also experienced stuff his siblings didn't, most notably more lenient parents, more space, and more time alone with parents. Things have a way of evening out"
"I am so sorry that you've lost your father at such a young age. I lost my father when I was 16. I've been exactly where you are so I hope I might be able to help you out here. Unfortunately, it's not all good.

Teenagers tend to be fundamentally self-centered. No offense meant. It's just kind of a fact of nature. Most kids your age are completely unprepared to deal with something as serious and impactful as this. Their typical response will be to just ignore it. It's awful, but they're really not equipped to do much else. I'm sure you've noticed this in other areas. You probably feel that most of your peers are still living in a naïve, childish world where everything is easy and the biggest concern is who is dating who. While you have been forced to grow up and face the real world.

When my father died, I also lost my best friend and our small group that we hung out with. They stopped calling, stopped inviting me out, and I eventually quit trying. It was hard. It hurt a lot and it honestly still hurts a little bit. But as a result, I was forced to seek out new friends (I had social issues as well) and become much closer to the couple of acquaintances that didn't push me away. I found much kinder, empathetic, and overall better people to be friends with. Those people are still my best friends.

I think you should reach out to your friend and tell her how you feel. Try not to be accusatory or attack her. Tell her that you're having a very hard time, you miss her, and you could really use her help getting you through this. Don't make it about the fact that she's been neglectful because that will just make her defensive. Make it about the fact that you need her help right now. She may step up to the task or she may not, but you should let her know that you need her help.

If it doesn't work out, you should know that there are so many other great and worthwhile people out there to make lifelong friendships with. Most people don't end up staying best friends with the friends they made at 4. You're going to make lots of new friends as a young adult that will be in a mental place to empathize with you, cry with you, and love you.  

Again, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Please do not hesitate to seek out grief counseling and other forms of therapy. 

Edit: I'd like to add a little more to give some insight into your friend's headspace. It's very hard to know what to do in these situations. My best friend just lost his father a few months ago and even with my experience, I still struggled to figure out what to say and how to reach out. I love the dude, but I didn't know what he needed from me. It may just be that she's scared of saying something wrong and making things worse. If you reach out to her and let her know what you need from her, she might be happy to help you out. It's very possible that she's just scared and doesn't know how to approach the situation."

"I’d just text him “Oh, I figured it was your girlfriend asking questions. But if it’s just friends and family, I’ll leave them up. Ttyl.”"
"That's part of the problem with dating someone a few years off in age... the two of you are in very different stages in your lives.  She's 30 and ready to do the whole house, marriage, kids thing while you're just starting a career and maybe want to have a bit of relaxation and adventure before you pay a mortgage and change diapers.

You need to tell her that you love her and want to be with her for the long-term, but you're not ready to have the responsibility of marriage, kids, and a house.

Offer to compromise and revisit those things in a couple years.

And if she breaks up with you, that's okay, because it was over a significant disconnect in your schedule for your lives that couldn't be worked out... not for any personal fault or failure.

If you do stay together, make sure to take care of your own birth control."
"Good heavens, how’s he going to be once you’ve actually given birth and need time to rest and heal? 

I’d insist on marriage counseling, starting right now. For better or worse? Sickness and health? What the actual fuck is he thinking?"
"&gt;I had asked my fiance to at least pick up my kids. He responded ""I'm not picking up your fucking kids!""

Why in the name of *god* is this asshole still bearing the title of ""fiance""? Is this how he speaks to you normally? Why do you put up with that? Why do you put up with letting your kids see someone treat you like this? "
"My (STBX) husband said almost those exact same words to me - that I was using the pregnancy as an excuse to be lazy. This was in the last couple weeks of pregnancy and I was miserable. He never did very much to help around the house or with our children. I spent another 11 years like that (there were other issues in our marriage, but this was a big one) and it was awful. Don’t be me, OP. Set firm boundaries, go to couple’s counseling, and if things don’t change, leave. I’m sure it’s scary to think about that since you have a baby on the way, but I was a single mom with my first child and it was easier than having my second child with my husband. Be strong- you got this. "
"&gt;I offered to pay for the hotel for work ($300) because he waited too long to reserve one that the AF would pay for.

I couldn't follow anything after this.  He didn't book into the paid accommodation so you decided to pay for him to stay somewhere else for training?  Why?   It's his problem.    Same goes for the expenses for his family vacation.  Why are you paying for any of this?"
"Make a noise complaint with the police next time it starts up. If he continues playing it after they leave, call again. He can eventually be charged with something, especially if he repeatedly ignores their request to stop multiple times in a night. Second, dont fear him. If he tries to stop you to talk in the future, tell him youre very busy and do not have time to speak. If he is insistent, just keep walking. Regardless of whether youre coming or going. "
"I'd say it wasn't worth putting your own job and integrity on the line. 
Imagine if you'd hired her and she turned out to be useless. It wouldn't have looked good for you. Sounds to me like she knew she wouldn't do well, and was hoping for  a free pass. 
"

"&gt; If you've never met him he almost assuredly doesn't exist.

Or even worse, he does exist, but is unaware of Wendy or her stalking obsession with him."
"holy fuck dump his ass yesterday, hard to fathom that someone could be as cocky as your (ex)bf is. Also those ""friends"" are people you should never speak to again, they showed you zero respect."
I can’t believe you’ve let it go on this long. She is most likely having an affair. You better have a talk. 
"Someone once said to me, if it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no.

It doesn’t matter if the no is “not right now, no” or “never ever in no way is this happening, no” the result is the same.

If you’re done, be done, because my friend did this and in the end he broke up with her and married his next girlfriend. Choose what’s right for you, he can catch up or he’ll have to miss out "
"Sounds like you guys have everything under control now, congrats"
"I love that you posted another picture! Don’t take it down! 😂 
He’s a piece of shit and you should call him out, and/or give his girlfriend a heads up about what a douche he is so she can get herself out of that relationship. 
If I was his girlfriend I would want to know. "
"It honestly seems like he romanticises past relationships. I’m sure if you talked to any of his ex’s they would probably say they felt the same way you did. Especially since he keeps in contact with his ex’s. It really has zero to do with you, and everything to do with him. Sorry you went through this. But I would not persue a friendship with him going forward. "
"He doesn't find it ironic at all that *he* is the one that asked you to change all of the plans and he's saying things like ""Fine. I guess we'll do what you want. Again."" Because basically that's what he wants, to get his way in every way about this. He's a fuckwad. "
"No, that's ridiculous. It's income. I'd love to have the IRS not tax my side gig, but that's not how it works. Income is income. He's taking advantage of you and gloating about it. You need to have a serious discussion with him about the overall financial position you're both in. "
"You're not ""essentially married"" if you can't discuss finances. And if you can't have a reasonable discussion about spending habits you don't have a relationship. It's absolutely fair for you to want to get on the same page. If she can't hear that then you've got bigger problems. "
"I think it was incredibly inappropriate of your wife to mention this to Matt before talking to you. If you say you are uncomfortable with it, that makes you the bad guy in Matt's eyes and that was manipulative of her. You need to talk to her about that.


As for the actual issue, have you gotten to know her ex? Maybe you can do things together. You, him, and both boys (and maybe your wife) to games, amusement parks, etc. Let Matt (and Jake) link you to these fun events as well, instead of just the ex. And this way you can also get to know him and see how he interacts with the boys and how comfortable you would be in the future not being there."
"Don't feel horrible. That was a very passive-aggressive way of speaking to someone (how he spoke to you) and there were other ways to handle it if he wanted to bring it up. I don't think you should bring it up again unless he tries to say anything else, but you should understand that you didn't do anything wrong. "
"Wow, I’m sorry. I would just keep in mind that if getting money from you was the kid’s intention, they were almost certainly goaded on by their terrible parent."
"&gt;Finally, he said ""you know whats funny? at the end of all this I'm still getting effed."" and I replied ""how exactly are you getting effed? I'm paying you out for the lease and your name will be off the car loan - your fear of being effed is going to eff you so much more than any person could.

This was solid. He is not being screwed at all. If anything, he's leaving the relationship ahead. You're paying extra in rent so he wouldn't have to take on a roommate. He's not out of anything except time which you are too. Yes, he'll have to hunker down because he's losing someone willing to put in more than 50% of the total living expenses and he'll have to find a way to buy a car. That's normal adulting and not being screwed over.

My only advice to you is to not take your time finding a good living arrangement. Your home will either become toxic or you will find yourself back with him. Find someone to stay with for a while until you find a place for yourself. Absolutely nothing good will come of you spending much time there."
Why would you have a child with this man? You are basically going to be raising it alone
"There's a saying, ""Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.""  There's also a huge difference between ""exaggerating a story, and/or using hyperbole, for comedic or entertainment effect"" and ""telling an absolute fabrication, or manipulating a story to get a desired effect from the audience.""

Examples of the former:

* ""The fish was close to 10kg and took almost an hour to reel in!"" (maybe the facts were the fish was 8kg and took 45 min to reel in. But the story is still the same: the fish was big, and challenging to reel in.)
* ""My sister burped so loudly, it stopped traffic.""
* ""Honest to God, Tom Hardy looked right at me as he walked past.""

Examples of the latter

* ""My last partner died of cancer."" (lying to elicit sympathy or attention).
* ""For our last anniversary, we went on a cruise ship for 3 weeks!"" (""No, we went for a weekend away in the next town."")
* ""Tom Hardy asked for my number, we're going on a date in Paris next week.""

See the difference? I suspect your wife is of the former category, not the latter.

&gt;my wife rips into me for constantly correcting her in front of everyone else. Which I fully admit I was doing

Yeah dude, that's seriously rude. It's rude to do to a friend, but it's incredibly rude and humiliating to do to a partner, *constantly*.  If these are old friends of your wife, I'm going to guess that they know for themselves she is prone to exaggeration, and thus know to take her stories with a grain of salt.

Your wife isn't delivering a lecture on a topic that requires a complete devotion to facts, she's telling stories amongst friends. You interrupting her just to tell her she's wrong, over and over and over again, in front of your friends, is incredibly rude of you."
"&gt;And some days I feel like their relationship with my ex is really, really unhealthy


I dunno about unhealthy but it's a bit sad for sure, for both parties. 


&gt;Maybe it’s normal for parents to have this level of contact with their kid’s exes


No.


I feel like this must peter out at some point. How are they maintaining a friendship with some 26 year old ex of yours. Why is he putting energy into this? 


&gt;he went to my house when I was at school and told them the most skewed, self-victimizing version of the breakup.


They didn't think this was weird? 



Anyways, I get what you're feeling and I'd share your feelings about the good morning texts. In the end it'll just mean you're drifting away from your parents faster, they don't sound really kind towards you anyways. "
"Adulthood is taken, not given.

Move out. "
"From a quick scan of statistics, somewhere between 5% to 7% of the US population believes in reincarnation while 50% believe in life after death of some kind. Spiritual intuition, visions, etc. come with the territory. He's got a lot of company, and while some might say all spiritually inclined individuals must be insane, they're usually only as ""insane"" as anyone else who believes strongly in a specific world view. 

Among people who believe in reincarnation the conversation your boyfriend had with you is a low key, normal conversation. To offer some context, there are a significant number of average people out there, fully competent in all sorts of responsible positions, who interpret their experience of the world through the lens of spiritual connections that last longer than a single lifetime. This belief is not only about romantic partners, but friends, family, acquaintances, etc. 

Of course, your compatibility would be higher if you both believed in a spiritual existence, visions, etc. It's normal for those who believe in reincarnation to test  the topic on people close to them first, then remain silent with those who find the theory crazy, because they know their belief will only cause the emotional reaction you're displaying here. Your boyfriend seems to have thought you'd be okay with the conversation on some level. 

He clearly hopes you'll at least accept this belief/experience as part of who he is, even if you don't join him in believing it's true. It's up to you to decide how to handle this, but his experience is likely a very different mindset than that of a stalker. 

I think the core problem (where your fear originates) doesn't need to be focused on his beliefs about reincarnation, but his beliefs about consent. 

When people believe they've known someone in a past life and agreed to meet up again it's usually seen as a mutual arrangement that is meant to be verified/confirmed by both during the ""current"" life. (You've been together for a year, so he's clearly given it time to see if you want to be with him.) If either decides not to follow through on an arrangement that the other remembers they originally made between lives (or in a previous life), a **respectful** believer in reincarnation knows the other has every right to say ""no"" and make different choices (in the same way consent functions in all other areas of life). 

Basically, believing in reincarnation doesn't define his views on consent in a relationship. 

Hopefully he has already demonstrated that your consent is very important in your relationship until now. If that is the area you're worried about, focus your questions there. "
I feel so bad for OP here. I can't imagine having my first pregnancy overshadowed by such douchebaggery from the father of my child. It's pretty heartbreaking. 
"&gt;  Finally, he said ""you know whats funny? at the end of all this I'm still getting effed."" and I replied ""how exactly are you getting effed? I'm paying you out for the lease and your name will be off the car loan - your fear of being effed is going to eff you so much more than any person could. You expect the worst from people and thats all you're going to get, because it's what you give. I dont know why you're letting some experience from 10 years ago damage you so badly. I'm willing to be open and vulnerable with you and you can't reciprocate that. You're never going to experience true love unless you are willing to open up"".

Well done.  I think you have a good handle on the situation and his mindset.  You do deserve to be with someone who wants you back."
"Old school 'power move' you'll find in some business body language books, but when you look at him next, skip making eye contact with him, and instead, make 'eye contact' with his forehead. 

Looking at a person in this way has a subtle effect, but it creates this uncomfortable, hard to describe feeling (I've heard it being described as being 'looked over') with a bonus that you don't have to look the person in the eye.

It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it *is* noticible to the person you're looking at, even if they usually won't be able to describe why your gaze makes them feel uncomfortable. From their point of view, it's *like* you're making eye contact, but something is off in a hard-to-pinpoint way.

I sometimes do it to my wife in a teasing manner, and I'll get a ""you're doing that forehead thing again! Stop it, it makes me feel weird!"" pretty quickly.

"Everyone else has given you great legal and practical advice already, so I'll share my tips for dealing with scary neighbors!

Odds are he's targeting you because you're a young woman living alone. I'm assuming the inappropriate questions he asked you included ""Do you have a boyfriend?"" He likely wouldn't be harassing you like this if you had a guy living in the apartment with you. He's standing outside the building to intimidate you, don't let him. Come and go as you normally would, and try to look busy as you are. Mess around on your phone or pretend to always be on a work call.

Women are taught from a young age to be polite and avoid conflict. Do the opposite. Stand tall, don't hunch your shoulders or speak softly. Match his tone, as long as it's not yelling. If he antagonizes you about the complaint, tell him his bass literally shakes your room and makes it impossible to listen to anything, even with headphones in. Don't explain or justify beyond that, just walk away.

If you have the resources, invest in a dashcam and a Nest cam for your home. I've dealt with a lot of dudes like this, and nothing's ever happened once I told them to fuck off, but it's always good to be prepared just in case he tries something.

Finally, report the issue to your local police department. Call the non-emergency line every single time he cranks the bass. Most municipalities have noise ordinances, and floor-shaking bass in an apartment probably violates that."

The most I’ve ever been hurt by a parent was when my then step dad stoped referring to me as his daughter and as my moms kid. He wouldn’t do anything for me or include me to spite my mom. And that made both of our lives a million times difficult and ruined my self esteem. Don’t put your kids in that type of position. "

"It is never going to be fun to tell her that you don't like her cooking. It will never not make her cry and get offended. There will never come a perfect moment when you can bring it up and she'll take it well.

But this will never change until and unless you say something.

So, if you think you can continue eating this food that actually makes you gag for the rest of however long you're together, which may be your entire life... then do that.

But if that's NOT how you envision your life, then you will tell her eventually, so you may as well do it now and start enjoying good food again.

Sit her down some time you don't have some of her food staring you in the face. ""Girlfriend, I really appreciate that you cook for me. I can tell you work hard in the kitchen and you want me to be happy. That's why I have to tell you this: I don't like the food you've been cooking. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to hurt your feelings and I appreciated the thought, but I simply can't eat it any more.

""I love you and I want us both to enjoy mealtimes together. I'll understand if this means you don't want to cook as much. I'm willing to cook sometimes and we can eat out other times. Or if you do want to go on cooking, I'd appreciate if you'd follow the recipes without experimenting. I've seen you do this and I know you're capable. I really look forward to eating all the great food you choose and prepare.""

\-""If you were a good boyfriend you'd just eat it!""

""I don't think you actually want me to be secretly unhappy, right? I'd much rather we work together to make both of us happy. That means I have to tell you honestly what I'm feeling, just like you should tell me if something is bothering you. That way we can improve.""

\-""You should have told me before!""

""You're right. I put it off because I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I'm glad it's in the open now."""
"Well he already untagged himself, so if he texts you again about it I'd lay into him honestly. ""Aww, I'm sorry your friends and family didn't like them. I'm kinda surprised your girlfriend didn't object more, she must be so chill. Yeah, I know, and fuck you."" Oooooor.... You could be a friend and send her some screenshots so he can't deny anything and block you. "
"&gt; so he kinda stays out of it.

He's the freaking father, he doesn't get to ""stay out of"" parenting his own child."
"Move out. You live under their roof, they can set up houserules. That means you come home before curfew. You get your own place, you make your own rules."
"IMO:

- Trip to see parents, esp. if it happens ""rarely"", you shouldn't have suggested that he cancel it.

- Paying his expenses, on the other hand, you're not obligated to do that.

So, tell him you apologize for suggesting that he cancel the trip, and tell him that by all means he should go.  But also you're not funding the trip, because your money is tight too, and he's taking you for granted and being manipulative on top of it.  

So, basically, complete freedom to plan his trip however he sees fit, schedule, finances, everything.

And when he blows up, point out that a fight will lead to losing you and the relationship, and then you DEFINITELY won't pay for anything. "
"&gt; I don't want to deprive him of seeing our son, and deprive our son of seeing him.

Somehow I don't think this is going to be nearly as much of a problem as OP thinks it is."
"Notice how your sister was only worried about serving time and what your parents would think.

Not once did she mention the dude she possibly just killed. Maybe some time to reflect on the fact she abandoned a person she just injured would do her good.

Ask your parents how they'd feel if it was your sister who got hit and left in the middle of the road at night."
I think this is the final straw. This is insane! 
"Welcome to the rest of your life!  Things may be crap for a bit but life is gonna go up for you without his dead weight holding you down.  

One important thing:  get an STI test.  "
"&gt; This was almost 3 weeks ago and he hasn’t said anything to me. So I guess has decided what he wants. 

You have your answer (actually you had it by the time the party was over). Just be strong when he inevitably comes crawling back to you, hat in hand."
"&gt; Also, if he leaves I'll have to solely rely on my mom financially and I don't want to do that to her.

Is this really that different than it is now? How much does he really contribute? It seems like it would be easier and cheaper overall for everyone.

I suspect that your mom would be thrilled to kick his ass to the curb.

Plus, child support."
Stop making the same mistake over and over again and expecting a different result. 
"I was in the exact situation as you. I was on good terms with these neighbors as they were young guys. They thought they could take advantage of the situation since we were all nice. 

Nope. Got fed up when their bass broke my wine glasses in my cupboards. Took a video of the bass/music, sent it to the property company. They got fined and pissed off. Still kept doing it, got another fine. Still doing it, I called the cops. The cops didn’t care what time it was, when music is that loud, it’s not allowed at any time "
He's just trying to intimidate you and make you feel as though your complaints are silly or unwarranted. He is bullying you. Don't fall for it. 
"Except be very honest with yourself and with her about what your timeline might look like. If you think you won't be ready until you're 30, tell her that now, not when you revisit in a couple of years. It's a crappy move to string her along with 'soon' just bc you don't want to break up. "

Or he knows and the “ex” is his current girlfriend 
"So you're married to a guy that does odd jobs under the table for money to hoard cat figurines, spending thousands on single items that he'll leave in a box. He's spending his inheritance on it, and expecting you to save up for a house by keeping both of you afloat by holding down two jobs. Is that about right?

In my opinion, your husband should have two choices. Sell off his 'collection' (AKA obsession) on ebay, put on his big boy pants and get a real job where he's not going to get you both strung up by the IRS... or pack his shit and leave."
"I agree with your assessment. If she doesn’t want you to try medication to get better, she doesn’t really care if you get better. That attitude would be a deal breaker for me. Antidepressants have literally turned my life around for the better, they were the best decision I ever made. "
You’d think at 31 he’d understand that life does not revolve around him. Good on you OP for not changing your plans and going to this event! 
Giving an addict fresh out of recovery a lump sum of money is a great plan if you're secretly trying to have her relapse and OD. 
"How is this not adding up? Extended periods away + no sex life + pregnancy test + serious trust issues on both parties = break up cause its cheating or simply toxic.  In either case, why are you putting up with this?"
"Make sure you have a counselor lined up to help you get through this. You're being so very brave, but don't forget to take care of yourself."
"If I had to guess, James will die in a tragic accident shortly before or after the wedding. That's just based on my experience with this sort of person, anyway. If you know any of her family, I would ask them about the wedding and then pass along the knowledge that she is unwell.

I personally wouldn't bother confronting her, though. Pathological liars, which is probably all that's going on here, will just double down or come up with excuses. There's really no getting through to people who are THAT good at lying to themselves. Hopefully ther's not something even crazier than that going on here."
"Hey Op,  do you live close to your parents or family?  I'd suggest given your husband's petulance and lack of support that you move home for a while. 

Cause chores aren't an employment contract. They're the basic things you do to maintain your home and doing more because your spouse is pregnant and can't keep up is an absolute basic thing to expect from your husband.

Given his petulance,  it sounds like you two need counselling.  But given his current behaviour he's going to say nothing is wrong. Not to mention physical labour is a bad idea at certain stages of the pregnancy.   Basically, that's very little you can do about your husband at the moment (if at all).   So move out and go home.  Get some help from family or your parents or friends.  

And hopefully this is the short,  sharp shock he'll need to raise you guys need to talk to a relationship therapist and actually work at it. 

(personally his refusal to do chores to begin with in the relationship would have made me dump him all those years back.  Ugh.  But well I assume there are reasons you want to stay married) "
"There are a few partners in my due date group accusing the moms to be of using the pregnancy as an excuse to be whiny, lazy, get attention etc. I know it can be hard to understand the level to which it affects a person, but this shit started when many of us were literally throwing up multiple times a day. 

I just...you know, I think about all the effort it takes to keep a premature baby going. Incubator, IVs, oxygen, feedings, teams of medical professionals, round the clock monitoring. And all that MASSIVE effort is happening inside a pregnant woman's body. She's literally life support for--by month 7 or so--a fairly complete human being. Plus all the organ squishing and relaxin fucking up your joints and giving you major hip pain and all that other third trimester wonderfulness. I'm not quite six months pregnant with my second and I'm already having a noticeably harder time breathing as a 12+ inch person floating in a water sack takes up an increasing amount of my internal real estate. It CAN be hard to see how difficult it is from the outside, but damn, if these guys just picked up a book or followed the What To Expect website week to week they'd have a good idea what their partner is experiencing. I don't understand why finding a little empathy is so terribly hard. "
"You need to set boundaries.

""[Girlfriend], when I am at work, I need to focus on my job, and my work *has* to come first, before responding to texts.  If you are going to text me while I am at work, I need you to understand that I will reply when I am available, and if I do not respond right away, it is because I am focusing my attention on my job, not because I am ignoring you.""

If she can't accept that, then she's demonstrating that she's not emotionally mature enough to be dating an adult. "
"From the way you described her behavior, I think you can take solace in the fact that your ex will never be with her. The other girl was very obviously not attracted to him and the fact that she saw of just how much of a fool he can make of himself, most likely gave her a negative view of him. He's in lust not love and he is ending his relationship for nothing. The idiot is so luststruck that he can't even tell."
"I had a bandmate who would also lie constantly to make himself seem interesting. He lost $50,000 in the stock market after 9/11 (he was 17 on 911), he threw some kid who tried to stab him out a window, he had dinner with Billy Corigan (smashing pumpkins). He would also lie for no reason at all. The rest of us just assumed it was related to the fact that he was adopted and felt unimportant so tried to compensate. Also his parents would let his lies slide so he expected everyone else to, too. 
Eventually we just couldn't believe anything he said and just stopped taking him seriously as a person. Sad.

Edit: spelling"
"Thanks for writing all of that out. I

 was his date to a wedding where he was a groomsman last year and afterwards he even commented on how sucked that he didn't get to spend much time with me! I spent half the day sitting alone in a  hotel room while he did groomsman stuff and then was alone at the reception while they did pictures. This isn't his first time being in a wedding party, so he knows the drill. "
"Unless you want to spend the rest of your life eating terrible food, you have to tell her. It'll hurt short term, but be better long term."
"Wow. 8 months. 

I'd have a very serious talk with him, maybe even couples therapy. If things don't improve.... You cannot change him.

I wonder how he behaved the 7 years before that? Did anything change in your perception?"
"I wouldn’t attend family events where my partner wasn’t welcome. Flat out.

Are you actually planning on going to your family’s place for holidays and leaving your partner at home? That’s really cold to do to someone you claim to love, who already has experienced familial neglect. "
"Your daughter comes first. Before all else you have to think, what is the best for her?"
"&gt;I'm going to need his access to a lawyer.

Why? Why can't you find your own? Why is he the gatekeeper here? Why does he need to be involved? Trustfunds or something?"
"&gt; She noticed how shit his behavior is, so if it makes you feel any better, she will most likely reject him. And he will have no one.

Absolutely. She apologized to OP as soon as she went outside, clearly uncomfortable and aware of the situation.  He has zero chance. "
"&gt;I'm so tempted to break the lease and pay the fee, but my boyfriend doesn't want to move out.

Start doing your research into getting your old place back, or a new place that you can both agree upon. Don't remain miserable just to appease your bf."
"Are those examples real? If so, I would honestly egg her on because your MIL is reaching such absurd levels that it's hilarious. Start an anonymous twitter account and post these stories of SIL's success. 

The real question is - do you actually want her around for 6 months in your house?"
"Ok, he sounds horrible! Slut shaming you, witholding sex for made up reasons but making you preform sex acts on him.. honestly, no one should be treated that way from a so called loved one. Plenty of decent guys out there who wouldnt hold your sexuality against you while demanding a bj. "
"When his dad does pass it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse, because he'll feel the need to support his mom, and he'll want to maximize the time he has left with his mom.  

You need some professional guidance, this is above reddit's pay grade."
"Hi, I'm an organismal biologist. Toxoplasmosis gondii is transmitted through cat feces by inhalation or ingestion. If you really didn't wash your hands after doing that, then handled food then MAYBE she got it that way. They typically recommend pregnant women to not personally scoop litter.. that's as far as it goes. If it was that easily spread then pregnant women with cats would have very high infection rates. I understand your guilt, but I hope you can accept It was 95% likely to be a food contamination. I wish the very best for you and your family. "
"Am I the only one here who thinks that James is obviously catfishing this friend of yours?

Heres what will happen: something will go wrong right before the wedding, and he will be somehow stranded without cash. Your friend will have to forward him a couple of thousand to make bail/get tickets/etc. He promises he will be good for it because he is a millionaire after all, evidenced by all of his fake pics of which she showed you some.

Be careful. Either she is a fake, or he is. Either way, she needs your help. If she is the fake then she is a disturbed person who needs help to be normal. If he is the fake, you better have some tissues ready."
"A lifetime of abuse from her father can't be ignored. She was naive to think that the parents separating would make her dad less of a monster and because she invested so much in that idea while already so clearly emotionally strained it has hit her many magnitudes harder than it should have. 

She needs therapy. Like it really is as simple as that. He was abusive, she may have any number of anxiety and trauma related disorders. Maybe straight out PTSD. She needs to get realistic about her dad and who [or what, rather] he is. She clearly can't achieve that alone.

Be careful. If she gets married without the dad there it will 'prove' he doesn't care. I worry she will leave you at the alter to avoid the finality of his betrayal or that even if she did go through with it she'd never recover. Putting the wedding on hold so she can deal with this first is probably worthwhile, it is clear she isn't ready for anything major right now and it will only get worse."
"Im sorry, but I lost it when she suggested  that you sell your car. That’s literally how you guys make money.

I know you are trying to be fair but you are getting taken advantage of. She sounds very demanding. She wants things done but she is not doing anything..

Get a financial adviser or don’t, but do not cancel your cheap gym membership if she is keeping all 4 of her personal health items.

I would never treat my bf this way. "
"She’s asking you if you see a future with her - not to propose right now. Even though you are not ready to get married, do you see a future with her? 

Remember, you two are close to 30. Many people are already married or found the person they will married by then. Having to start over later in life really sucks. She might need reassurance that she’s not wasting her time. And that your goals somewhat align. "
"&gt; I know relationships feelings on age difference, but I'm not so sure it's relevant here


Dude dated a 17 year old high schooler when he was 22. 


You're 21 now, do 17 year olds look like adults to you? You're still a year away from being the age he was when he started dating you.



It's relevant because that's the kind of guy who'd be sketchy about girls. "
"This is my father. This kind of crazy high-standards- but ONLY FOR YOU, and NEVER COMMUNICATED because a good wife would have read his mind- never ends. My mother still deals with this today.

Is that the life you want?"
"If Maria continues to throw a fit, ask him to speak to his GySgt and let them know what has been going on. I have no idea if she's the vindictive type, but it's not worth risking his career to find out. They may be able to shift her to a different shop or place him in an admin job (not great for promotions, but it'll mean more free time to help you with the arriving baby)"
"&gt;  We work it out and 6 months later he proposed. I said yes.

First mistake.

&gt; Now it’s 5 months till the wedding and we have since bought a house together.

Second mistake.

&gt;  Anyone have any suggestions on what to do?

To stay with him, after he has demonstrated time and again that he is a cheater would be a third mistake.

Don't make a third mistake."
"I mean. If the story is ""and the [local business] overcharged us five hundred dollars and took three weeks to get it cleared up!!!"" when it was really five dollars and it was cleared up the same afternoon, that's something that could adversely affect someone's life and I'd correct it.

But if it's stuff like ""it took me twelve hours to clean out the basement!"" and it really took seven hours... who cares? It doesn't affect anyone's life in any way. If you tell the same story again later and it's ten hours, no one will care. If they even remember how she told the story the last time, I'm sure they're well aware that she exaggerates.

Here's a secret: A LOT of people embellish stories, either because they're misremembering what happened or because they're trying to make the story more entertaining. The vast majority of the time it literally doesn't matter. ""The truth"" isn't really being injured if it's about inconsequential things. 

(Tbh if I was listening to someone get corrected all the way through their story it would annoy me more than knowing the story was exaggerated.)"
"&gt; Now we have sex and while it’s still satisfying for both, that spark and passion isn’t there. We both love eachother deeply and have so much fun together. Where does that fire go though? 

This is the nature of long-term love. The flames don't leap forever. After a time, the fire dies down and then either you've built a good enough fire that the coals smoulder hotly even though the flames aren't leaping... or you haven't.

The passion doesn't last forever. Not for anyone. It's what gets couples through the first few years and keeps them together long enough to work out their differences and form a strong bond.

That's where you're at now.

You care about each other, you're real with each other, you don't have to hide the fact that you have bodily functions. This is not the time to pull back and try and re-create some of the 'mystery' you used to have. This is the time to dig deeper. To dive in and build on that trust and that familiarity. 

Have a conversation with your husband - tell him that the change in passion has you feeling worried and anxious. Reassure one another. Share your feelings. This is how you strengthen that bond now - it's not about just having a spectacular night of amazing sex, because this isn't just a physical coupling you're involved in anymore. This is a love match, a lifelong partnership. 

To a degree, you *have* to be roomates who also have sex. You are best friends who have chosen to be best friends for always, but with the amazing added bonus that you love and enjoy one another physically.

If it helps, don't think of this as a rut - think of this as the foundation. The two of you have arrived in a place where you've got a solid, dependable, predictable relationship build - and predictable isn't a bad thing - predictable is dependable, trustable, it's the promise you know will be kept.

That relationship doesn't deepen just with wild, fiery fucking anymore. It deepens with care and attention, with conversation, with the respectful resolution of disagreements, with acts of sacrifice and indulgence.

Your relationship hasn't gone wrong. It's just settled down into a shape that will go the distance. Now go have a conversation and enjoy the onward journey."
"&gt; I'd feel stingy asking him to pitch in more money for food. 

This right here is the crux of your problem, &amp; you need to work on getting past that. Your boyfriend would be paying for his own food if he ate at his home, so why shouldn't he be paying the appropriate amount for meals you share? 

I think the ideal solution is twofold. One, your boyfriend kicks in a fixed amount for groceries each week, &amp; you can meal plan for your shared meals based on that. Pick things like chicken &amp; pasta / rice that can be filling without being too expensive. Two, make your boyfriend his own snack shelf, which he can refill with items he brings to your house. When he gets hungry an hour after dinner, he can eat from his shelf. This can include more expensive items like juice, yogurt, etc. 

It may be uncomfortable for you to ask him to do this, but it’s not fair for you to stress about food &amp; money because your boyfriend is too socially unaware to realize that he’s not at his parents’ house raiding their fridge. I’m hoping that your boyfriend just doesn’t realize the food disparity going on here, because the other option is that he’s knowingly eating you out of house &amp; home. But either way, you really need to speak up &amp; make this issue known. "
"&gt;I can't go to HR because she is HR.

Then you can go to HER boss and let them know what she’s been up to. The HR person, of all people, shouldn’t be spreading rumors. "
I think your BF is telling you loud and clear that he doesn't want the kind of commitment you want.  I would be extremely wary of paying for his schooling.  Don't bend over backwards and potentially harm yourself for someone who has made it clear they have no intention of committing to you in that way.
"I think I would try to explain F's role in the family a bit more. Take the gf away from your family for a bit, and talk about how F became integrated, how she and your grandma do salsa lessons, how she and your brothers play games, and how she is considered a sister who just didn't happen to be born into the family. Then let her know that you understand your girlfriend's feelings on the matter, but that if you were to ask F to step back from the family, girlfriend would never fit in. That the family, you included, truly sees F as a sister, and would see it as girlfriend asking the family to alienate another family member. Explain that you understand it's a difficult dynamic to understand if you didn't grow up in it, but that there's nothing romantic with it. However, if she wants to have a relationship with your family, she needs to try to have a relationship with all of your family, and that includes F. 

It may not be a popular opinion, but unless your family isn't great, I'd stick with family. I've seen a lot of people cut off family and friends because their partner was insecure. Definitely try to work it out, but if it comes to an ultimatum, and it usually does with people who are insecure, then choose family. "
"I'm planning a wedding right now and according to etiquette the invitation was for your BF and YOU, not for 2 random people. 

I'm pretty sure if he asked the bride and groom, they wouldn't want a random person to go to their wedding. "

Congratulations on patching things up."
"*looks at age difference*


Yeah, I'm betting your hair isn't the first thing he's been weirdly controlling about, is it? And that's beside the fact that his attitude and reaction was disgusting and bigoted.

You can decide whether or not this is a dealbreaker, but if he continues to make those kinds of disrespectful and bigoted remarks I would question what type of person you've involved yourself with."
"And then he's probably going to complain that she ""got fat"" and he is ""not attracted to her anymore"" because she doesn't have time to go to the gym for 4 hours a day and get rid of the baby fat in 3 weeks while she's raising 2 children (husband plus actual child) plus doing all the chores."
"My mom is still friends with an ex of mine from 15 years ago.  You can't say don't be friends, but you can say you don't want to hear about him ever.  Tell them this in a conversation about how they can continue to do so, but you are 100% not getting back together, and you don't want to hear his name as it would be hurtful.

Then when they invariably bring him up, you tell them you already told them you don't want to hear about it and they're disrespecting your wishes and hurting you by doing so.  If you're lucky this will stop them soon.

If they're like my mom, they'll just keep bringing him up, and you'll start getting really angry when they do.  ""Mom I've been asking you for 15 years not to talk about my ex.  What the hell is wrong with you that you can't respect that?""   ""oh it was just an interesting story..."" 

Good luck"
Ask him to call you redneck daddy in bed.
"Yup I agree, totally unfair since she expects you to give gifts. You should have an open dialogue with her about this. 

She might feel entitled because maybe she's always been the person receiving so thinks it's normal. But if you give her a heads up about your own expectations, I'm sure she's meet you half way. A relationship requires two people putting in effort. Since you're both think about marriage eventually, it's really good to have this conversation now before she's really set in her ways during marriage"
"I would never wait this long for anybody, especially with a child. You absolutely need to leave before she gets there to show her that you won't be pushed around like this."
"Ahhhh. Schrodinger's household labor strikes again. Taking care of a baby is so easy YOU can't use it as an excuse not to make pasta from scratch, but so difficult he can't possibly be expected to do it for even a day. "

"Maybe he should strap a 15-20 lb weight around his stomach and then try and complete his chores!

Fatherhood is going to hit him like a ton of bricks. 

Edit: I was told 30 lbs would be more accurate. "
One word comes to mind: gaslighting.
"Good riddance. You deserve to be with a guy that wants you. Frankly, he’s entirely too old for this foolishness. And you’re entirely too old to put up with it. 

The disrespect. The fucking gall. What a problematic loser.  I’m pissed for you. I’m offended by his treatment of you.

Q-tip with makeup on in the trash that he has no explanation for? Unless it has been 6 months since he emptied the trash I would say his explanation is too thin for something that specific.
"To be honest, I think you might be overestimating your friendships with these people.

If someone invited me to an ""I didn't kill myself"" party and they weren't a very close friend, I'd probably be very weirded out. And your current classmates don't have any personal investment in your previous degree--so again, only close friends would go to that. 

"
"Same with “I don’t want to ship him back to his mommy because that would make coparenting complicated.”

Um, if this dude can’t even coparent when he is unemployed and living in the same house as OP, then he’s definitely not going to coparent when he’s *states away*. 

Who cares if he doesn’t have anywhere to go? This is the best he can do. He said so himself. "
"It almost like she keeps crying to try and avoid the truth. Between people telling her they don’t like her cooking, and no one touching her food at parties, I think she’s almost being purposely oblivious. Plus she gets offended when you try to cook with her? Something that is usually a fun couple activity, I think she knows her foods terrible. 

Of course, it comes down to taste (or lack of). And her not liking what’s being made at cooking classes makes me kind of happy that she didn’t waste money on culinary school to learn to make food she probably won’t enjoy there either. 

It’s just astounding to me that someone who makes a day of buying fresh ingredients could make something edible. The simplest of dishes can taste exquisite with fresh produce. What on earth does she do to it? 

Is she open to taking constructive criticism? Or maybe buy her a basic cookbook, about spices and herbs and meat pairings. The basic culinary stuff. 

There’s no nice way to tell someone you hate their cooking but you’ve got to do it sooner rather than later. "
This goes beyond just being late for things. She's disrespecting *your* time and it's inconsiderate not to mention selfish.  I would absolutely break up with someone over something like this.
Sounds like you may not be ready.
I would've been grateful to land the interview if I was her. She needs to carry her own weight beyond that. You did nothing wrong.
"Unfortunately, you probably won't be able to convince your adult daughter to leave her boyfriend with words alone.  All you can really do is let her know how you feel, and then to protect yourself as best you can.  This guy needs to be banned from the house, despite any objections from your daughter.  This may result in her leaving too, but you have got to let her make her own decisions and experience the consequences thereof.  She needs to see and, better still, experience the ways in which her affiliation with him negatively impacts her life.  She's likely to lose her job or at least experienc professional blowback if she gets a drug conviction.  She shouldn't be insulated from her bad decisions by getting to stay in a comfortable home with her boyfriend and his friends, that you pay for, while enduring sexual harrassment.  Some tough love is in order.  Most kids her age will do everything in their power to rebel against the expectations their parents place on them, no matter how common sense or well intentioned.

It's not your fault she's gotten herself involved with this guy.  It's also hard to watch someone you love self-destruct.  Cut yourself some slack and realize that you can't control her choices, only advise, and when the advice is unwelcome, you can rest easy knowing you've done everything you reasonably could have."
"I think you are paranoid and he is just jokingly addressing you as the boss because you are telling him what to do. I don’t get a sexual vibe from him at all. I think you see it as sexual and maybe hoping he does too, but I really don’t think he does at all edit: you can tell him he doesn’t need to announce he’s following your instructions going forward but sexual no I don’t see it !

"Throughout this entire post, the best thing you’ve had to say about your relationship is that it’s lasted a long time.

I’ve been lurking in this sub for over a decade now, and I’ve seen many stories like yours. I have not once seen any of those posters come back with happy updates, where their partner learned to step up and start giving a shit.

And that’s the issue here, really - he simply does not give a shit about you.

It’s not about his emotional capabilities or depression, because he actually *can* do all that stuff you need. He’s demonstrated that over the last few weeks. So he could have been that man this whole time - he simply chose not to, because he does not give a shit about you.

He knew that you were hurting and alone. He knew he should have put his phone away at your birthday dinner. He knew he should have engaged with you more at home. He knew he should have been happy and excited for your new job and social life. He’s not an idiot. 

He was capable of all of this, and only started doing it now, because it was going to affect *him*. When he said he didn’t know it was “that bad,” he meant that he didn’t realize it would have consequences for *him*. He knew you were unhappy, but he just didn’t give a shit.

Leaving a relationship of 10 years with someone you’ve grown comfortable with is hard, and so I’m not going to tell you to do that. But as you think through your options, please keep one image in your mind: him at the table at your birthday dinner, playing a video game on his phone for five hours. 

That’s who he really is, right there in that moment - not this new guy he’s pretending to be to get you to shut up again."
"Oh man, a real life Morello from Orange is the new Black."
"Ugh. This sounds like a nightmare. I would confront her and tell her to stop. You pay to live there too and can do as you please. As long as you’re being responsible, she has no right to ask you about these things. I would have this conversation now before she actually moves in. Once she does it’ll probably get worse. Good luck. "
"&gt;I don’t know if it ever really felt like home for her or just some place she was stuck in for years. 

Based on your original post, I'm going to say the latter. It sounds like right from the beginning, your mother made an effort to make Emily feel incredibly unwelcome in her new home, and that effort was unrelenting over the years. The fact that Emily moved out as soon as she graduated from high school, and worked two jobs in addition to studying to ensure she never had to come back, speaks volumes.   


It's great to hear your sister is doing great in her adulthood, and that your father is helping you and your brothers keep in touch with your sister. Now that you're an adult, you too can choose what kind of relationship you want to have with your parents."
"Actually, me too. We're still friends and all but I think I really need to put some distance between us and focus on myself for now. I'm glad I missed the call too. 

I applied for the job after we broke up and never mentioned it to her so I guess she never found out. 

Thanks for the support!!"
"""So, family, what you are saying is that I should have *lost my job* to ensure that Cousin got hired. Good to know that's where I stand."""
"Hi. Lawyer here. Yes, he was asking you out. Or rather, he was giving you the opportunity to call him so he can ask you out. 

The dating (former) clients thing is sticky. There's still a perceived power imbalance, especially immediately after he's just done a good job and you're feeling grateful for his help. He can't ethically ask you out while you're still a client. He's technically ok doing it when you're a former client, BUT it can still feel a little sketchy. And if he's direct (""hey, now that I've saved your ass, why don't you go to dinner with me?"") it can border on creepy and the last thing he wants is a grievance for trying to flirt.

So yeah. He was putting the ball in your court (HAH!). Which is the safest thing to do for him, professionally speaking. If you're interested call him. I assume he'll ask you out directly at that point. If you want to make him laugh, offer to sign a release. 

Lastly, speaking as someone who has done criminal defense, the percentage of clients who are 1) female, 2) not addicts of some kind, 3) generally ""nice people"", and 4) people I'd actually want to date, are very, very, very low. I wouldn't worry about him trolling for hook ups from his client base. 

"
"&gt; They didn't think this was weird? 

sounds like they dont like their daughter much

they may love her, but not like."
"Hey I just want to let you know that if you two get married, you'll be divorced by 30 and I'd bet the house I live in on that. She's 20, you're being brow beaten, and you've been together a year. Thats the most classic recipe for divorce that exists. 

&gt;She lashed out at me again this morning and it ended by her storming off to work and texting me that she's gonna get her things and leave when she gets home

Good, let her. You two need to break up. She has horrible, crazy ideas about marriage that will ruin the next decade of your life. Dodge this bullet. "
"You are one of the few brave cashiers out there who do that. I could never see myself do that 😳. Anyway just handle this situation like your job: when you are done with one customer, move on to the next one in line! "
"&gt; I imagine if we do give her some or all of the money it will eventually be taken by creditors.

Anything you give her will be swallowed or snorted. "
"Your BF is acting like your money is his money, and that's not okay.  

You earned this money, saved it specifically for this purpose, and spent it wisely (used vehicle in good repair).  

The fact that your BF is acting so poorly about this is a big red flag."
"I don't think that was cringy at all, you just sent one message.  If you were sending several messages without a reply my answer would be different.   Online dating is tough."
"Why have you paid for any of it or devoting any mental space at all to his finances?  He's 23, unemployed and couldn't be  bothered to make his reservation in time.   Why is that your problem to solve?"
"He's gone out drinking every day this week, and didn't come home last night? He sounds like he wants to be single. 

You'd probably be better off if you were single too.
"
"I am so excited for you, I can't wait for you to get past the breakup and almost vomit at the thought of having been with this guy. Its an equally gross but liberating feeling. You'll feel amazing. Get rid, strangers online are disgusted by his unhealthy relationship! "
"You keep saying ""she saves"" and ""she pays her bills"" and ""she spends her money""...but if it is ALL combined, it's not really hers vs yours, right?

What kind of combined finances do you have?  My husband and I have our paychecks go into a joint account, with automatic payments against our combined debt and into a savings account.  Our bills are also paid from that account.  We also have an automatic transfer of a set percentage to our own, individual accounts for our spending money on things that are not related to our household or marriage.  Neither has to check with the other about spending from that account, but spending out of the joint account cannot exceed $100 without consulting with each other.  We don't have separate savings accounts, just the joint one.

Why don't you try something like that instead of trying to split it back out right away?"
FUCK FUCK did not think of that. FUCK.
"Please for the love of all that is holy, do not stay with this dude “for the baby”. You do not want to portray this as a healthy relationship to your child. It is much much better for you and baby to get away from such a toxic person."
"Yes you're infantilising her. This entire post is full of ""I wasn't ready at 26 so nor is she"", ""she underestimates the difficulties"", ""she might regret it"" ""she'll need leisure"". Stop speaking for her! She's a grown ass woman who knows her own mind. I'm nearly 40, and wouldn't have wanted kids in my 20s, but a friend of mine had babies age 25 and loves motherhood, knew it's what she wanted, and has taken to it like a duck to water. None of her friends her own age have kids yet, and it doesn't matter - she's got older friends with kids, new friends with kids, etc. 

If YOU aren't ready for kids, and if YOU don't want to give up your leisure time, **be honest about that.** Stop projecting your concerns onto her. She is not you. She has her own hopes and dreams, which clearly involve having a baby. But you need to have an honest conversation with her about your feelings - stop trying to tell her her feelings are wrong. "
"Do you always apologize when he does something worth apologizing to you over? Because that's what I see here. A situation in which you've learned avoidance of upsetting him by apologizing when *you* are the one who should be receiving one. He's literally punishing you for days with silence for having a social life apart from him. Despite your insistence, this is absolutely not a healthy relationship. "
"OP beyond the issue with your wife, I hope you're seriously thinking about a pivot strategy to get out of your current job. It'll kill you. Life's too short, your wife could work too if jobs in your field are scarce."
"Yes, your BF is approaching this in an entitled manner, especially since he has no skin in the game at all. At this point, I'd tell him that you are not looking for his opinion on this matter and would appreciate it if he never brought it up again. If he doesn't, great. If he does bring it up again, then he clearly has issues respecting your wishes about things that don't concern him.

And let's be honest, an 8 year old Civic that only has 100k is still a baby. As long as your parents are willing to defray the costs of the major maintenance items that may come up (brakes, tires, belts, etc), I don't really see the problem."
"She should seek therapy immediately. Go with her if you need to. She's Stockholm syndromed and can't separate her fantasy dad from the reality of who he really is.

Is there a second person who would be willing to walk her down the aisle? "
"My high school ex was like this. Tall tales about how he was jumped on the way home from school by 5 massive guys but beat them all down with a backpack, how he stole a car, drove backwards down the freeway, etc. He was great fun, too. Had pizzas delivered to my class to embarrass me, would set up big scenarios for his friends to come across a great surprise. 

Anyhow, he is in prison for murder now. They can be both pathological liars and unstable making poor decisions.

Meaning: check the basement, OP. 



"
"Agree. Dated someone who did this. Would tag along after I said Id do an activity alone and then complain the whole time or ask ""how much longer are we going to be here"" every 10 minutes. "
"Ok I'll come back and write more when I'm done reading but:

Your severely underemployed boyfriend, who only works 4-hour shifts, tried to refuse to take you, his PREGNANT girlfriend, to the EMERGENCY ROOM because he was TOO TIRED and had to get ready for his next 4-HOUR SHIFT?? WHAT???

Edit: Okay I'm done - OP, you are DEFINITELY better off without this guy. What kind of a father would he be to your kid if he won't even do chores or take you to the freaking ER? Look, what you think is love is just familiarity. You've reached your breaking point already and you resent him and the position he's putting you in. And he shows no sign whatsoever of changing. You've given him way too many chances.

I often think r/relationships jumps the gun on telling people to break up. But OP, if this guy is really that irresponsible, it could be legitimately dangerous for you and for your newborn. This is flat out unconscionable behavior. And no, being depressed isn't an excuse, I know people are going to come in here and say that. At some point, it becomes Not Your Problem Anymore. This is that point. And no matter how much you worry what's going to happen to him if you leave, you need to accept that it just isn't your problem. If he sinks, he sinks, and that's tough, but at least you won't be wearing concrete shoes anymore, and maybe it'll be the kick in the ass he needs to grow the fuck up.

Edit2 because I forgot to say what a saint your mom is. She'll be so relieved when he's not around anymore."
"This truly is the beginning of the end. This ball of yarn is eventually going to unravel. But, because of everything, naturally, you are going to try to make it work for a while longer. But always keep it in the back of your mind being married to someone that selfish is a house built on sand. Take every step and measure to protect yourself when it ends. Make sure you have income, a job, saving socked away, and your own separate attorney. I know you think we're all crazy for saying stuff like this. But it is just one of those things that is obvious from a mile away but invisible when up close."
"A few thoughts on this:

1. Needing a final headcount on meals at least a month before the wedding seems SUPER early. I think a week or so before the wedding is the standard timeline, at least in my part of the US. 

2. It doesn’t sound like you were going to be the only person your boyfriend would know at this wedding, so it’s not like he needs a replacement date so he will have someone to talk to. Also, he’s in the wedding, so whoever he brings will be spending a good chunk of time by herself while he’s fulfilling groomsman duties. It’s weird to me that he’s so insistent that he bring someone that he may not even see until after dinner. 

3. Is your boyfriend planning to move with you after you start the job? If I had to guess, it sounds like he’s hurt that you’re moving for this job &amp; is trying to pretend he’s not hurt or to hurt you back by demonstrating that you’re replaceable at this wedding / by making a big deal about how you’re potentially backing out of this commitment. "
Well she doesn't just want to date you until you're both 35 only for you to realize you don't want to marry her. Maybe you're incompatible simply because you have the dating experience of a high schooler. You both seem like you're in really different places in your lives.
I’d guess he already knows. 
He claimed in his yelling fit that no one else complains but I don't know how he would know that.
"You definitely have to squash them coming into your house and changing things, that should be a no go and your husband should get your back on that. Same for shutting down the kid talk.

But with his dad's condition I think you should encourage them to spend time together when they move down. His condition even if it is in remission now is pretty much a fatal diagnosis. Especially with your husband being close to them, they should definitely spend as much time as reasonable together. Definitely set boundaries and make sure to carve out time for yourselves where they won't/aren't allowed to interrupt. "
"I was raised mormon. In a mormon household this behavior would be considered even *more* bizarre and inappropriate. It sounds like your MIL has groomed her sons and has a Jocasta complex. I'd spend some time on /r/justNoMIL as many Jocastas tend to go absolutely insane once their sons get married.

I think your bf may want to get some therapy to learn how to set boundaries and to un-normalize this sexual behavior with his mother as it seems to be leaking into other areas of his life."
Good for you!  Enjoy the wedding that YOU want.
Yeah even if she was good and they found out it was her cousin op could get in trouble for not having someone else interview her
"It seems like you might be martyring yourself a bit here. I'm not trying to say that in a rude way because I know I have that same tendency, but it's really unhealthy to provide for others to the point of you being broke and starving. Do you really think your boyfriend would be happy if he knew you were almost in tears over this?

Taking care of others is lovely, but you also have to take care of yourself. It's not rude or petty to ask him to chip in for the food he's eating. You're not a soup kitchen."
lol reading this sub has given me a glimpse into so many peoples lives that I cannot believe even exist. 
"Yep, that’s humiliating. Leave him."
"He probably doesn't know about your fetish, but has probably noticed your slight reaction to this line of jokes, which is why he keeps going there. He's trying to be funny, but maybe also just amusing himself. "
Most likely OP isn't the only one complaining
"Honestly she's probably trying not to bring it up in case it unravels whatever composure you've gained since it happened. I know that if my friends dad died I'd never mention it for fear of upsetting them

Edit: and I'm 18 also so it could well be an age thing "
"&gt;I have been violently ill all week and have been staying home from work, but my fiance doesn't like me just laying around all day, he still expects me to run errands, do household chores and cook.

The fire ain't the problem."
"&gt;sadly I am under a lot of pressure from my parents so realistically I don’t have a choice in the matter.

Your parents are wrong. Their children are their responsibility. If you want to take care of him, go for it, but know that it is not your obligation."
"&gt;Ultimately, I want what's best for the baby.

Then ditch the boyfriend.

&gt;But if he leaves, I don't even know where he'd go.

Not your problem.

&gt; if he leaves I'll have to solely rely on my mom financially and I don't want to do that to her. 

You pretty much already do, at least if its just you and the baby she won't have to also support your dead beat boyfriend. You can work in a few months, even if only part time.

&gt;We could send him back up north on a bus, where he has family, but then co-parenting becomes an issue. 

Also not your problem. If he wants to see they baby he is going to have to come to you. No judge would ever agree on shipping a newborn anywhere or even letting them stay a night away from their momma.

&gt;I don't want to deprive him of seeing our son, and deprive our son of seeing him.

It's best for your son that you provide him a stable, loving home. Your BF is showing that he cannot be part of that.

&gt;I don't want to end up working, scheduling appointments and taking on majority baby care because my bf is too lazy.

You know this is exactly what would happen.

&gt;Weirdly, I'd be fine with it if I was alone.

So do it alone!"
"Yeah I'm the kind of person who would go full Southern passive aggressive about it... ""Goodness, how would they ever survive without you?"" ""With all that good advice you ought to be writing a book!"" ""What are the odds of a job just dropping out of the sky for SIL? Why she should play the lottery next!""

But that's not really sustainable for six months (!!!!!). "
"You take a lot of distance. One of the reasons you're disgusted now is that you simply know too much. You know how much money is wasted, how desperate your mom is in the texts, how sexual/intimate your parents are and you know that neither parent is willing to be smarter. You need to be away for a while to forget this type of information, then there might be a chance to rebuild the bond from new.

Because in that time, your parents are definitely doing to get worse financially. Instead of counseling or a divorce, this is how they want to spend their marriage. They both have certain behaviours that they choose and are set in: she starts an affair, he ignores. It blows up til there's a lot of drama and someone has to save her, that brings them together again &gt; on to the repeat. They will have to recognize what they're doing and why this pattern is relevant to them. They don't want to. Accept that you don't have any power in that and stop 'helping'/enabling by cutting your mom off financially at least. It might be smart to get some freezes on your finances, because desperate people do desperate things to get their fix.

"
"&gt;How can I politely extract myself from having to support my bioparents and my brother in the future? And more importantly, how do I justify my decision to them without feeling like a complete piece of shit?

You don't explain or justify anything. Do not discuss it with them *at all*.  And do not allow your parents to have any access to your financial records or credit information.  Put a fraud alert on your credit so that you have to approve any and all inquiries. 

Then, you get yourself into counseling to help you understand that your wanting to make them understand is absolutely pointless.  Finally, look for a job hours away from your family and start to build a life in which they play as little a role as possible."
"Your grandparents are being totally hyperbolic, but the advice to not leave a current job until you have a new one is not generational. Come over to r/jobs: it is generally easier to get a job when you have one, and it’s hard to predict how long you’ll be unemployed. 

If this job is bad for your mental health and you have the support or financial security to be unemployed for a while, then you should quit. If you can manage the job or can’t afford to not bring in an income, then I’d advise sticking it out while you job hunt. "
"&gt; I'm 20, and I'd be thrilled with a car, new or old.

Exactly. I got my parents' old car (Kia Cerato 2004) when I was 19, because I needed a car for work, and I was the happiest person in the world. I didn't give a shit that it was 12 years old, it's a good car and I'm perfectly fine with it. The only time I feel truly alive is when I'm on the wheel of it. "
"I'm only a few years older than you, but I'm married. This piece stands out:

&gt; There's no doubt in my mind that my current girlfriend is perfect for me

Listen. Being single and dating around is done in an effort to find *this* person. I know people who have been looking for someone perfect to settle down with for decades.

All I'm saying is, the grass is always greener.  
Not on the other side of the fence though; it's where you water it."
"&gt;I'm realizing that my siblings \[12F/14M\] constantly have nothing to eat, nothing to do, and live in a completely trashed house that's quite literally internally crumbling and quite disgusting.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't really want to bring child services into this because I feel that it's drastic

How bad do things have to get before calling social services is no longer ""drastic""?    

This is pretty sad.  I'm curious - what was your own childhood like growing up in that house? Growing up hungry is extremely stressful, mentally and physically.  It can also set the stage for lifelong struggles with food.  

Getting outside help can feel like betraying the family.  But in this situation, you are the only advocate for your siblings.  This is exactly the kind of scenario that these services are designed to handle.     "

"Im literally speechless that you are more upset that he has money 'given' to him by his mom than you are by the fact that he emotionally manipulates and financially abuses his mom so he can buy a new tv.

"&gt;He asked how I liked meeting his daughter, I told him it was sweet and pleasure to meet her since I had only seen photos. He responded with ""Oh, really?"" I was super confused. His tone of voice seemed very shocked that I enjoyed meeting them. He went on to say how obviously uncomfortable and awkward I was interacting with them. That he also told his wife and she thought it was weird too. I honestly didn't know how to respond. I just said ""Oh. I'm sorry."" and walked away.

This tells me that your coworker, and not you, is the socially oblivious jackass. Worse, I think he intended to mock you about it which makes him a jerk. Don't engage with him. "
"&gt; We both work and have usually done a decent job of dividing the chores.

&gt; hes always been touchy about the housework. It took a lot of time for me to convince him to do the chores he has now.

Uh huh. 

&gt; How can I address this and help him see how unreasonable he's being?

At this point? By telling him he can either go with you to a marriage counselor or a divorce lawyer.

He's not just failing to do his chores through negligence. He is *actively* refusing to be a partner, or a member of your family. It honestly sounds like he doesn't care about you, or the pregnancy, at all. 

Honestly, what was your relationship like before you got pregnant? Did you feel loved, cherished, emotionally supported?"
"Maybe instead of all these outings, Ex can start paying 8 years of back child support"
"&gt;As for the actual issue, have you gotten to know her ex? Maybe you can do  things together. You, him, and both boys (and maybe your wife) to  games, amusement parks, etc.

Not really. to be honest maybe I should put my pride away and actually get to know the guy. I had a lot of anger towards the guy for what he did to my wife and I was upset that my wife wasn't more angry at him.  I am already allowing my step son to go with him twice a month though so I should try and get to know him better. "
"As somebody that had her mother come help and whose husband literally had to work. You need to be careful. It establishes a very unbalanced idea about who does what. And eventually when your mom leaves, it will be very difficult to adjust. He needs to help, even if he works during the day. Babies are a lot of work. If he is already balking at work, that is not a good sign."
"Broken trust is a spiral, he lies to avoid arguments but then gets found out so you trust even less so he lies more. If you keep going like this it will just continue in a downward spiral. Work out if you want to save your marriage or walk away. Either way a therapist is a great tool to help you through the steps."
"So I am also a very neat/clean person living with someone who is naturally... not.


The first thing I'd say is that this is never going to be truly equal. The neater person almost always ends up doing more work. So I'd suggest three things:


A) Figure out what you can slack on. For example, the cooking. Just start making yourself something quick and letting her find her own dinner. What worked for my relationship was that I cook when I want to cook, and about an equal number of days he takes us out/buys dinner somewhere. He doesn't want to cook, that's fine, he provides dinner some other way.


B) Finding what you can stop doing that your wife will start doing more consistently. Can she set reminders on her phone to vacuum once a week?


C) Having a come-to-jesus talk about the things that you simply can't live with. 


It's the last one that will be the hardest. In my case, it was *also* picking up general clutter after I cleaned something. I had to basically have a nuke-from-orbit meltdown to emphasize how serious this was to me, how much it mattered, and how badly the disrespect for my time and effort was undermining the relationship. That at least got his attention; from there, I re-emphasized it every time by just not being nice about it anymore.


""How was your day?""


""Well, I walked in the house and immediately I saw how you left a mess for me to clean up after you, so pretty shitty right now.""


This will not work for everyone. It is not a pleasant, or particularly constructive way to approach it.


In my case, I was d.o.n.e. dealing with it and the next step would have been moving out, so going the nuclear option was, well, an option for me. And it did end up working. But proceed with caution. "
"Cokeheads don't sleep, they stay up all night and keep doing it til it's gone. He's not answering the phone because if he speaks, you'll be able to tell right away that he's geeking.

"You need to assert yourself and it doesn’t have to be awkward. When he tries these things, just tell him that you don’t feel comfortable having your feet touched or anything like that and you’d like it if he would stop asking. "
"Wow, I'm so sorry OP.  Your boyfriend is a jerk and totally pathetic.  I would just text him and dump him for being a loser.  Rest assured...she will VERY likely reject him.  She was cringing at his behavior and was sensitive and kind to you because she realized how much of a douchecanoe he was being.  He will pursue her, she will reject him, and he'll probably try to get you back.  Please don't take him back."

"If you do decide to meet with them and give them a chance, make it clear you’re not getting involved in their relationship with your grandparents, and that it will be a long time before you even consider having them meet your children. That should make it at least a bit more clear whether they’re genuine about wanting to repair their relationship with you and your husband (and that they don’t have ulterior motives like getting back in the trust, or having influence over your kids). 

Also, be sensitive to any hint they’re trying to change history by reframing how they behaved or what they said. People do this sometimes, and it’s bullshit (“I never said that” “I was just worried about how hard it would be for your kids, having an interracial family can be hard in today’s society” “I always loved you and I don’t care what I said, I would never have actually left you” “I always loved you and your husband. What, am I not allowed to tell you my concerns? Does it always have to be sugar coated?” “You were always so sensitive, I don’t remember saying any of that, maybe I was joking! You never could take a joke, really” “you couldn’t have thought I actually meant any of that! Do you really think so little of me?!”(making it somehow YOUR fault)). If they try to rewrite history about your dad’s racism, just up and leave right there, you’ve heard enough, they aren’t actually willing to own up to their shitty actions and racist beliefs, and they will not bring anything positive to your life. "
"Yeah it sounds like this ex is less of a casual “friend” for them and more like an extra child. This guy wormed his way into her family as revenge and her parents allowed it because they wanted to show OP that her refusal to let them pick her boyfriends has consequences. 

Petty on both sides and a very sad game for three adults to be willingly playing. They have to know on some level that OP’s ex is not talking to them because he enjoys their witty repartee. "
"This grown adult man has the immature and ridiculous sexual hang ups of an 11 year old. He's vile for asking you to have sex without a condom then insulting you for your past sexual activity. 

&gt;He says if i can keep away from having sex for 3 months, he’ll consider it. However, ever since this he has said this, he constantly wants blowjobs, hand jobs and every sexual thing... except sex

So... He let's you finish yourself off, but you also have to finish him off. So you do 100% of the sexual pleasing in this relationship and he's telling you that you're wrong, even gross for suggesting that's not what equity looks like. 

This is going to sound like a leap but I think he's cheating. Avoiding sex with guilt based arguments while expecting less intimate sexually gratifying acts is projection. I think he's doing all of this weird, nasty, inexplicable stuff because he feels guilty having intercourse with you while he's having intercourse with someone else. We've seen it before here, and the stories we're similar. "
"If he's said something unprofessional about you to your coworkers, I'd head straight to HR and explain the situation to them. Get ahead of it and make sure that your narrative is what they hear first. You can be vague with the details, but explain that it was a social situation, nothing that should affect either of your work performances, but that you want to make sure that the incident is behind you. If you hear more about it after that, or if he is unprofessional or makes you feel uncomfortable at your job in any way, make sure that you keep detailed notes about who said what, the date, time, where it happened, who else was there or might have heard, etc. If necessary, go to HR again and tell them that he is making you uncomfortable at work and/or his behavior is unprofessional. The laws will vary from state to state, but in most states it's illegal for your company to fire you or take adverse action against you (demotion, giving bad shifts, poor performance reports, etc.) in retaliation for reporting things like this.

"I'm sure they minded to some degree, it just wasn't an instant deal breaker."
"it means you have to start dating again and focusing on your stuff. The fact you are jealous it is because you believe they are doing better than you do at this moment. When you start dating again and if your ex-girl still has feeling for you, she would be the one at your position right now.  "
"&gt;Then when they invariably bring him up, you tell them you already told them you don't want to hear about it and they're disrespecting your wishes and hurting you by doing so. If you're lucky this will stop them soon.

Important addition: if they continue to bring him up after you have told them not to, **leave**. Leave the room, go home, hang up the phone call etc. They won't respect your boundaries if there are no consequences."
"If I was the other girl, I would have lost all interest as soon as I found out he had a girlfriend but was still being flirtatious with me. It's hurting the other girl, and how long until he does the same thing to me?

I have a feeling he is going to end up with neither one. "
"I've actually been spending some time today writing down his last few paycheck amounts, what he contributed to the house, what was spent for necessities, and what he spent on weed. Also writing down how much my mom has spent to cover what couldn't be bought after said weed was acquired. I'm trying to make a visual representation to show him how parasitic he has become. 

You are right, my mom is not a fan of him right now. She doesn't tell me outright, but I know she's been waiting for me to grow a pair. "
"Tell her to pay for it if it's that important to her. 

Why is this on you? She can pay for you both or she can go solo. Get her own damn credit card and max it out. "
"The majority of 23 year olds aren't ready for any of that. Dont do anything you aren't ready to do. Your going to have to have a hard conversation and tell her. Shes going to have to decide what or if she is willing to wait for. Maybe she buys the house herself and you pay rent. Maybe you can put off the other things for a few years. Or maybe she can't because,  as sad as it is, if she wants kids shes got to get moving on it. If she cant wait then you guys might break up. "
"&gt; I said yes and just told them to let me know the details and what not

There are three months between those months where I would have gotten up with them about it to let them know I really was interested. "
"This is why they have therapists available in the world, mi amiga.  Go find one. Chat about all the above with them. That person will likely have some insights and explanations as to your behavior, and what you can do to get back on track.

This is not a permanent state, and it will pass."
"Why is your mom so afraid he is going to hurt himself with simply, easy, 'hard to hurt yourself' tasks? Why is your mom so afraid that if he knows his own address he will give it to predators? Why does your mom believe he is an incompetent human being?

Be aware that isolation like your mother is doing your brother can be taken as abuse. Her being irrationally afraid is not an excuse.

Edit: Spelling. "
it will fall apart in a much slower and more painful way if you don't
"You'd think a grown man who was cheating would flat-out not let photos be taken of them and not have Insta or FB to avoid getting caught. But no, this dude lets you take a photo of him shirtless cooking while camping. And then gets mad when you post said photo. 

Cops always say they're thankful most criminals are stupid. I feel that way about cheaters. The good ones are scaaary. Leave the photo up. Playa played himself. "
Why can't he buy cheap food for himself to eat then? Save the good food for you and him to share.
"Fault aside, why are you with this tool?

&gt; I have been violently ill all week and have been staying home from work, but my fiance doesn't like me just laying around all day, he still expects me to run errands, do household chores and cook. 

That is fucked. Seriously. This is not normal behavior.

&gt;I didn't want to bother my fiance at work over it, he doesn't like that.

Your kitchen could have burnt down. This is the type of thing you have a right to call your spouse at work about.

&gt;if I hadn't ruined dinner, he wouldn't have to waste $12 on a pizza. 

Flat-out verbally abusive.

It's not anyone's fault. Accidents happen. But your fiance showed his true colors. Please, for the love of God, for your safety and that of any future children - do not marry this asshole."
You can try. He'll pass it off as 'crazy ex' and she wont listen :-(
"I would insist on being able to have access to the footage the same as her. I would not move anything to make her visibility better until she gives you full access. I also would tell her that unless you have notified her, she should assume nobody is stealing microwaves and you probably know what's going on in the home you are currently living in better than SkyNet/Big Brother."
"She doesn’t give a fraction of a shit about your feelings, so don’t worry too much about hers. She knows she’s taking advantage of you. "
"It could be that he was just being awkward with business stuff. But typically if someone is wanting to ask for reviews, they email. Just re-reading the context of your last post, I think he might've been interested but more put the ball in your court to contact him since he had to walk a more fine line with business.

From your original post:

&gt; Honestly I did feel a vibe of attraction between us the whole time

Are you interested in him? If so, then call him up and say, ""I know this might be odd considering I was your client, but I really enjoyed our conversations about x, y and z, and I was wondering if you would want to go on a date to Square Dancing Event with me?"" 

Edited to add: if you do this, then pm me an update!!"
You mean your EX boyfriend. 
"If you're working with a sleep therapist and a doctor and have tried everything, there is no shame in not sleeping together. There are plenty of reasons that couples sleep in separate beds, and although it's not ideal, if this is something that's a threat to you physically, then it may simply be what you need to do. It's a medical condition - a disability - that's simply going to have to be accommodated if no solution can be found.

How about single beds? You could still be sleeping in the same room and have that connection."
"Tell him you support him. You're there if he wants to talk. Give your opinion 1 time. Then leave it alone. 

If you push for a divorce, he might feel pressure and then if SIL apologizes or has a tearfest, he might fall for the BS again just to prove you wrong. If he decides on his own, she loses that power. He's a grown up, you might consider him your little brother, but he can make his own decisions. "
So how much therapy are both of you getting? Because in your situation I imagine you could get it for free or through a cult-survivor support system 
"Your husband is doing what he feels he needs to do to distance himself from his crush.  All you can do is support him and love him.  Let him be the judge of what will work for him, unless he asks for your opinion.

Also, what attracts a man to a women isn't one thing.  Don't stress that he found someone attractive who wasn't exactly like you.  He chose you, remember.  "
Not OP but I really appreciate your perspective on a situation like this. My own longterm relationship ended last month and your comment brightened my outlook on re-entering the dating scene in the future when I'm ready. Thank you for that!
"&gt;that we could've fixed it independently of law enforcement and things would be fine. 

What? Were they going to go out and hunt the guy down and hope he wasn't dead? Were they going to dig a ditch to hide the body? If they'd found him alive what were they going to do to make him not go to the police?? 

Your family is so. very. wrong. here. You did the right thing and I'm so sorry you're getting hurt for it. Your sister is 23, not 13. She can't be coddled like a child at the expense of someone's life."
DON'T MARRY THIS MAN - YOU WILL REGRET IT
"Dump him. He’s garbage. His friends are garbage. And he’s got to be a complete narcissistic psycho to think he’s at all in the right in this situation.

And also, I doubt it was about your body during or after pregnancy. He seems to have some really deep issues with commitment and maturity and idk, not being a total piece of crap? And if it was about your pregnancy bod, STILL dump him. That’s no excuse to cheat. You’re bringing life into this world and he’s messaging pornstars? So. Pathetic. "
"Are you seriously going to fuck up your relationship with your own kid just to hang on to someone who, frankly, sounds like a giant shit-stirrer? There probably *were* boundary issues with your family, and if so, kudos to you for standing up to them, but demanding that you cut off your daughter's mother for - what reason, again? - is a bridge too fucking far IMO.

&gt;DM and I were in frivolous dispute and wife spoke up in group text with me, DM and wife.

Why was your wife IN a group chat with the two of you to begin with? Because she was jealous and demanded to see all your communication with DM?

EDIT:

&gt;She has said that if daughter has a problem with wife maybe we need to go NC with her too.

**WHAT.** wtf??? OP, this problem begins and ends with your wife, because that's *insane*."
"Have you thought about raising kids with this man? Because if he has all these 'expectations' of your life, I can imagine what he will 'expect' from his kids. "
"That's what always baffles me in posts  like this too.

OP you know full well nothing is going to change. If he didn't care enough to help you before, why would he care now? "
"Yes, our work here is done. Everyone take the rest of the week off "
"Came here to say this. As a woman on the autism spectrum myself, OP's description of her gf made my spectrum-senses tingle."
He does not want to marry you and is going through the motions. Once you have the ring on your finger he'll shift the goalposts again and tell you that a short engagement isn't compatible with his business goals. He is not committed to you and you need to forget about the ultimatum and leave. 
"I'm from the UK and often read posts about American family relationships where people ask, is this hugging or kissing, or walking occasionally nude from the bathroom to the bedroom in the middle of the night okay? And it's normal for my country but not for a lot of America. 

But this. Getting in bed with your adult kid and his gf. Pressing your nearly naked body onto theirs. Stroking each other's slightly more intimate areas in bed. Come on girl, you know this isn't normal or right in any culture. I'm telling you now, if you bring this up and try to wake him up to the fact his mother has been grooming and sexually abusing him and his brother for their whole lives, he will refuse to agree, side with his family and cut you out. And if you say nothing it'll continue and more crazy shit will come out. And then you'll have kids. And she will start to groom them and abuse them too. 

Nothing good can come of this. There is no way this relationship can be saved. Give him a gentle heads up, the number of a good therapist, and then run far far far away. "
"He’s trying to control the creepy narrative. he is turning your wedding into you marrying your sister. If he waited for you to announce first HE would seem like the weird one. Even though y’all have been dating longer (presumably) than you and your fiancee’s parents, people are NOW thinking of you and your partner as brother and sister. Pretty fucky, if you ask me."

You need to tell management he threatened you. If you imply this could turn into a criminal/legal situation they’ll take it seriously. 
"You’re all 100% right. I took today off from work as a personal day and I am currently packing what I can. I’ll be moving to my moms house 2 hours away and make the commute to work until I can get my own place. 

Thank you for the advice and the wake up call I dearly needed. "
"I grew up poor, the sort of poor Hollywood likes to depict when they show poor southern trailer park communities “on the wrong side of the tracks.” That sort of poor comes with problems people raised in middle class homes won’t likely ever have just like middle class homes have problems white collar homes won’t ever have and white collar homes have problems the 1% won’t ever have. “You don’t know what you don’t know” is an apt statement her. You can’t know her life and she can’t know yours. The only way either of you get a glimpse of that is via sharing your past because whatever that past was, it helped shape who you are today.

I’m in my mid 40’s. I’m still finding out things about my childhood that weren’t “normal,” still discovering how poor I was. I actually grew up thinking everyone lost power around the first of the month. Nope. My parents just regularly didn’t pay the power bill and it was routinely turned off. I’ve worked hard to get where I am now but it’s flabbergasting to know I have more money saved in my retirement account than both parents made in their entire lifetime. I am a money hoarder. 

Here’s what you need to consider for yourself and your relationship: If you’re in a relationship where you’re walking on eggshells, withholding your thoughts and feel like you have to censor your experiences, is that a relationship you want to pursue? This isn’t about whether or not you’re “good enough” for her, it’s about whether or not you can feel at ease around her. It’s about whether or not you feel judged. You’re not guilty for having been raised in a life of privilege and you acknowledge it but you seem to feel guilty about it. You have to let go of that guilt. You can only change your own feelings about yourself and your past, you can’t change hers. 

She may one day realize the experiences of others do not diminish her experience. She may not be open to that discussion yet. You won’t know until you try to talk to her. 
"
"This is certainly worth worrying about. Your brother doesn’t even know *his own address*. And he’s even trying to grow in some areas (easy cooking, shaving his mustache he doesn’t like), but your mother is preventing him from doing so.

She is very clearly smothering him to an unhealthy degree.

But I’m honestly just as worried by your father’s attitude. He sees these things happening, he *wants* to help, but he’s too worried about coming between your mom and her “baby boy”?

Holy hell. Your brother is as much your dad’s child as your mom’s. Your dad seriously needs to step up here.

In fact, reading your post, I naturally assumed the dad just wasn’t in the picture anymore, until I reached the end. It’s incredible that he’s willing to sit by and let your mother stifle your brother to this degree.

As for what you can do? Have a frank talk with your dad. Point out that he knows what’s happening is hurting your brother’s growth, and that your dad really needs to step in.

And stop staying home to handle things for your brother that he can easily learn (like making mac n cheese). When your mom asks, tell her he’s old enough to make it on his own, and you’ll no longer be doing it for him. If she still won’t let him, *she* can stay home all the time and be at his beck and call."
"&gt;I ended it on the spot.

Good.

&gt;I guess my question is, is she right?

No. Fuck no. 

Dude, she wanted you to drive her to the goddamn *jail* to visit her old fuck buddy. 

Dude. Come on.
"
"&gt; That was a very passive-aggressive way of speaking to someone (how he spoke to you) and there were other ways to handle it if he wanted to bring it up.

Yeah seriously. Even if the person was legitimately uncomfortable around your children, that is A-Fucking-Okay. You don't approach them and give them shit for it. Sounds like the guy is just stirring up shit for some reason."
"He talked to him today. He's keeping an eye on it, and a few of the guys he works with are too, so if anything happens, it'll be dealt with immediately. "
"Do you two live together? Her reaction was blown out of proportion but maybe she misses speaking in her native language and got a little too defensive. If you live together, then I think she has the right to speak to her sister in the native language if she visits. If they ask you to do something with them though and speak the other language then it's rather inconsiderate. "
"There's honestly not a whole lot you can do, but if you have a method of contacting James, I think you should. For confirmation and possible warning. "
"Ugggg. I have dated so many of these types of guys. You want to do something, they don't,  you do it anyways they insist on being there and then complain the entire time, or are super passive aggressive about it. Let me tell you, being married to someone who says ""that's not for me but you enjoy so you shoul do it, and I'll do something else."" It's the best thing ever. We have the stuff we do together and the stuff we do on our own.  It's really nice and a vast improvement to the pissy insecure tag-alongs who couldn't just let go of me having any independence from them. "
"Frankly, it sounds like they didn't mind being racists until your grandparents cut them off. 

They thought they were just cutting you out but lost more than they bargained for. People like that at that age rarely change imo. You have a loving family without them.

Have you talked about it to your grandfather? "
"&gt; I never liked this behavior, but he was otherwise a good man and it didn't really effect me so I let it go.

You made a decision to kick this problem down the road to deal with later. And now it’s later. You’re right to be upset by this behavior, but you should have been upset about it years ago, before you went ahead &amp; combined finances, got engaged &amp; had a child together. There’s no reason to believe that he will change this behavior now, when he’s been doing it his entire adult life &amp; doesn’t see any moral issue with it. 

I’m assuming breaking up is not an option for you, so the best you can do is to separate out your finances again. Each of you pays half of shared expenses, maybe including savings / emergency for your child, then you keep the rest separate to do as you please. But if you do stick together as a couple, don’t be surprised when 10 years from now, his mother is flat broke as a result of his selfishness &amp; now needs to live in with you because she can’t support herself in retirement. Also don’t be surprised when he starts taking your own family into debt once Mom passes away or runs out of means to give your partner cash. If you choose to continue to ignore this problem, it WILL become your financial problem eventually. 

Edited to add one more thought: If he’s okay with his mother missing rent so he can buy watches &amp; rims, do you really trust that he will prioritize the welfare of your child over his own desires once his mother’s money runs dry?"
"It's okay to get a divorce. There are worse things than being alone. You two may have incompatible views on monogamy (unclear if you are okay with non-monogamy sometimes), but you definitely have incompatible ideas about who is in charge of your sexuality (spoiler alert: YOU are, not him), and consent. He tries to pressure and coerce you into sexual activity that you're not comfortable with, and that is not something he would do if he loved you even a little bit. He doesn't see you as a partner or even as a person. He sees you as a plaything, a toy, and HIS property and puppet. That's not something you can fix. That's something you walk away from."
"SIX MONTHS?

What the actual fuck? Why? And NO!

Seriously, you need to stop this trip happening. That's madness. This will destroy your life and family and marriage if you let her come for that long."
"So, your ex-friends are awful for doing that. Even if you had cheated, their behavior is shitty and they're taking it way too far. 

Everyone doesn't hate you. Your two real friends and anyone else who truly matters will listen to what you have to say. I'm so sorry that this is happening to you. Just stay strong and remember that, whatever their opinions or assumptions are, it doesn't change who you are so draw some confidence from that and hold your head up high. You're much better off without those people in your life. "
"My advice would be to pursue some therapy or support groups that can help you address your binging. Demonstrating self-control can be a major challenge for many people, but avoiding food at all costs isn’t the answer. You can’t reasonably hide from food all the time. This kind of thinking may hinder your weight loss more than you believe. It would be much healthier for you to learn some effective coping mechanisms such that you don’t isolate yourself from your friends. "
"Yes, and on some level he probably loves it when you mess up because then he gets to tell you you’re a bad wife or feel superior to you. He will never actually be clear on what he wants or he’ll “forget” he said something and change his mind, but never let you know that.

Please hear me when I say my father has never once “got it,” even after having horrible fights with all his children, and my mother buying another house to live away from him. We have all tried to talk to him, and even these drastic measures have done nothing to help him make a change."
Support her. Defend her. That’s all. 
"She invited you.  Not really something someone planning to cheat would do.

At the end of the day, you trust her or you don't.  If she wants to cheat, she doesn't have to go away with a bunch of friends to do it."
You listed like 5 things that sound borderline abusive. You can’t relax when you are sick? He rips into you for a mistake and deflects from any responsibility? 
"Honestly, do you need to have this conversation with your grandparents at all? I'm not trying to disrespect them, but somethings are best decided and dealt with alone. If you don't feel comfortable not talking about it with them, it might help them to know what your back-up plan is. For example, if you don't have a job in two months, are you willing to look at part-time work? Freelancing? Volunteer work to keep yourself busy? That might help reassure them that you've got this covered.

Also, 100% quit the job. It's definitely better to avoid quitting jobs without new ones lined up, but it sounds like this place really isn't giving you anything worthwhile."
"Oh, you *definitely* did the ""right"" thing, but it was not the smartest thing in terms of your friend's safety. Do not go over there to apologize, focus your efforts on making a plan to get your friend out of that shitty environment."
There's a comical amount of circumstantial evidence here. You don't literally have to catch someone inside of her to realize the truth. What's telling is that you're only now realizing that your girlfriend has been spending 1/4 of her time away from you. How checked out are you in this sexless relationship? What is potentially salvageable here?
"So well said. When I was 14, one of my good friends lost both her father and grandfather within a month's time. Our mutual friends and I would sometimes talk about it to each other, but other than telling her ""I'm really sorry,"" we had NO idea what to actually do or say, but not because of malice or not caring. I can't imagine going through a loss like this so young, and neither can most actual teenagers. Is avoidance the right answer? No. But please do assume ignorance rather than ill will, OP, until shown otherwise—I really hope your friend will step up for you!"
"&gt; I never liked this behavior, but he was otherwise a good man

A hamburger with a thin layer of cat crap smeared across the bun like a condiment is otherwise a good burger.

This is his *character*.  He's a user.  He's using his mom, and if he can't use her, he'll find someone *else* to use.  That'll be *you*.

Pick better."
"
The universe likes to  play little jokes with single socks and bobby pins. 

But the Q-Tip *is* a smoking gun. Add that he hid the photo of you two together, I think that'd stand up even in court.  

TBH I'd wonder just how long that other stuff had been there (bras etc). Days not months I expect."
"Laaaaaaawwwwyyyyyeeerrrr up. Do not move out of your house. Contact a divorce or family court attorney ASAP and follow their explicit instructions.

Your marriage is over. There will be time to mourn and bury it later. You need to snap into Papa Bear mode right now to protect you and yours.
"
"This is way above reddit.  That being said, don't give your husband something he doesn't want.

This is literally what therapy is for.  Talk to your professional and find a way to set up some group sessions with you, hubs, and Camille.  Ideally this would mean two of you in each session and maybe three occasionally.

Since there is a kid involved here, take it slow. There's no reason to rush, your husband and Camille have both been hurt and will require time and patience. Everyone needs to be careful to ensure Eva is OK too. "
"How were they able to move so much furniture around and repaint your house? Did you guys tell them you didn't want to do that...?

If not, I would start there. Your husband needs to get on your team, but in the meantime you can also tell them ""Actually I had a different idea for this room and I'd like to leave it the way it is."" ""I appreciate your ideas, but I like the room the way it is."" 

&gt;And when we do talk about it, just fun light hearted, like names and stuff or how we will raise our kids they interject and say things about how that it won't be that way at their house.

""Then I guess they won't be coming over to your house!""

You guys need some serious boundaries. Learn how to say no -- it feels great!"
"Sweetheart, seriously, who would be a fan of him right now. I feel like I can't even rely on this guy to properly pump my gas. Think of you and the baby first. "
"I think you need to be a bit more firm here and say ""Look, I've let you borrow it, but now I want it back."" If she likes it so much, then she needs to buy her own. I would definitely learn from this if I were you as well, don't lend her anything else! "
"Without intending to downplay what you're going through, at least you have intimacy a few times a month which is more than other couples with young toddlers.

Is there some compromise you can work out. For one saying you would like to have dinner together at the very least least and maybe a 15 min cuddle on the sofa. Frame it less about her spending 3 hours alone recharging and instead frame it more about wanting to spend a bit of quality time together, missing her and wanting to keep a level of compassion and connection in the marriage."
"She fucked your ex. You know it, and she knows you know it.

I would move out. For all you know, she's why you two broke up. "
"Um, if your salary isn’t that great why doesn’t your wife work? Not even a part time job? Tell her to you’ve busted your hump for 15 years and to shove that list of chores up her ass.

"I was about to comment and say this, but you beat me to it.

This is definitely sexual harassment. As a woman, I’ve been there (unfortunately), and the safest thing for you to do is leave. I wish I could say, threaten to call the cops on him and use the term sexual harassment to attempt to talk sense into him (you’d still need to leave), but your best bet to avoid him getting angry and escalating from harassment to assault is to not say a word. 

Have friends help you move out so you’re not alone with him when you do. If at anytime you feel unsafe, go to the police. They wouldn’t do anything except take a report, but once your roommate has a report on him, it makes the cops more wary if you file another one. "
"""You expect the worst from people  and that's all you're going to get."" So proud of OP for having such insight and calling him out on that. Now he can't pretend he doesn't know."
"Being in a marriage doesn’t mean simply not cheating. It means mitigating risks. It means setting clear boundaries; to simply say “well I’m not a cheater” is naive and a bit arrogant. 

Marriage comes with boundaries. It’s strange that he can’t see the risk he runs by inviting her to social situations outside of work. It’s again, naive and arrogant to think that because he stated he is married, she won’t look into these actions. 

You’ve addressed concerns. I think it was a serious mistake to ask his coworkers about this but I’m not privy to those dynamics. All I can say is, he admits she is attracted and it’s straight up foolish and risky to refuse to set clear boundaries via actions. 

He can maintain a friendly professional rapport without extra socializing. "
"If you don’t talk to him about this, you’re only going to stew about it alone. Tell him bluntly that you know, it’s gross and you’re losing respect for him. "
"He does really appreciate my cooking. He's good about cleaning up after my mess in the kitchen. It's just hard to have these conversations without getting defensive.

He's seen my receipts from the grocery store and exclaimed that I'm spending too much money on food. When he does the shopping he buys the cheapest things possible but I like to buy nicer foods and make things from scratch and honestly I'm not willing to compromise on quality. Money wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't eating 3/4 of all the food I buy. I'm so stressed about this conversation already. "
"Ok folks, it stops here. His last name is Corgan."
"&gt;He brings his friends to hang around our house drinking and smoking most nights

Why? He should've been banned from your house a long time ago, especially after hitting on you. Allowing him to come around your house makes it seem like it's okay or forgiven. Stand your ground here.

You cannot control your daughter's relationship, but you can at least keep this guy out of your household.

Maybe your daughter will learn, maybe not. It'll be tough, but continue to support and love her regardless. Keep communication open"
He is not planning to take time off work and my mother is going to come help me.
"I have a friend who was in your position 10 years ago when I met her. 

At that time she was 30 and had been with her boyfriend for 2 or 3 years and they were supposed to be moving in together “soon”. About 3 years later she lost an ovary to endometriosis and they still weren’t living together. As she was recovering from the surgery she wrote him a letter saying she wanted to get married and start trying for a baby immediately and if he didn’t want that then they needed to break up so she could find someone who did. He asked her for until the end of the year to think about it... and then kept pushing that deadline back and back and back. 

They finally moved into a house (he owns) together about 2 years ago. She’s now 40 and has accepted that she’ll never have children and they’ll probably never get married. She seems happy enough, but I have nightmares about what will happen to her if he decides to dump her at some point. 

I’m glad you’ve decided to get out and I hope you meet someone who wants the same things you do soon. "
"He has a tiny bit of a point in that we tend to do things that I like.  He's relatively new to the city, so quite often I'm the one who throws out suggestions about events or places.  I've told him that he can also Google things to do in this city and see which things interest him, but he had been saying he likes to do the things that I suggest.  Then he lobs this bomb at me.  So I wasn't mad before, but I am now with this revelation."
"In the same way that you didn't push him to get over Camille, you shouldn't be pushing him towards a romantic reconciliation. Give him time, space, and therapy. 

He chose you, and your post makes it so very clear why - you're an amazingly empathetic, compassionate, and lovely person. Your husband and Eva are lucky to have you."
"The second he told me he wished I were more like Mary I'd have told him he should try to be more like John, then.

"&gt; Adulthood is shedding the naivete that I can have both.

That's why they are growing ""pains"" not growing ""euphorias"". 

You think you're over it when you're legally an adult, but you aren't. No one is. There are still levels of growing into your own self that you don't know about until they happen sometimes. 

At my age, the one I'm currently facing is watching my mother grow elderly and diminish, knowing that sooner rather than later, I'll have to step up and the the one in charge because she won't be able to.

This is not a comfortable realization. "
"Things are either super spiced or bland. Sometimes she'll mix proteins with other proteins. or Carbs with carbs. Other times, she'll just go wild. for example:

* Steak and oatmeal with raisins.

* Chicken with satanic amounts of black pepper

"I can understand that you are all afraid to upset your mother, but seriously this is bordering on really getting to be harmful for your brother. Which is worse, your mother getting upset, or your brother growing up without necessary life skills?

I think your dad really needs to step up here. He's letting your brother down in order to not rock the boat. He's the other parent here, not you. He can't just stay out of it. You might mention that to him.

"I came into the post expecting this to be no big deal / a misunderstanding but I was wrong.

This is very, very weird and inappropriate, and the mother is the one instigating it. 

""napping in just boxer briefs and she would come up in her nightie and spoon him. She would stroke his chest, thighs, back, and arms. He would pull up her shirt to stroke her belly and would rub her body as well. They would nap like this fairly often. He would constantly tell her how much more beautiful she was than any girl his own age (which would actually be quite sweet if he wasn't rubbing his mostly naked body against her while he said it).""

That quote above is describing abnormal behaviour. 

I don't know what advice I can give but I want to let you know it's not normal. The mother is being sexual with her sons. It's disgusting, predatory and inappropriate."
"Anything that reveals you as a patient of hers to anyone else is a confidentiality violation.  Even if it wasn't, the fact is that you felt like your privacy was violated.  You have every right to bring this up to your therapist.

My SO is a counselor - he had a patient who passed and I un-thinkingly asked what his name was in an effort to see if he wanted to talk about it. He said he cannot tell me even just his first name, even after his death.

Hopefully this helps. Tell Sally about it.  If she gets defensive or is unwilling to see how she violated your privacy, it's time to find a new counselor. Good luck!"

"I’m so sorry.  But thank you for sharing.

The timing of your post is hitting me hard. My boyfriend of 11 years told me in April that he would propose in July. This was not our first discussion. He texted me a little while ago today that he had some errands after work and would be late getting home. One might think that’s a good sign. But I think he was just out buying clothes. I think he’ll have more excuses when I talk to him on Aug 1st. Your post makes me wonder if it’s worth trying to salvage things after that. "
Yeah the company is serious on this. 
"It seems like you are filling in a lot of gaps and projecting reasons why and assuming how she feels about you now with an email she wrote before you were dating, maybe before you even knew each other. If she wrote it while you were dating that would be different. But you two have been together 11 years. She waited for you while you were in Iraq. you've been married for a long time! She must feel something for you?  


11 years is such a long time. I definitely have emails from my exes but I'm not thinking of them. I just don't want to sort through 11 years of emails. Think about exes you maybe have and how you felt about them and talked about them while you were together, especially in very early stages of the relationship.  


It could just be that she was very passionate at that time in her life and in a new relationship, there are so many things that could have made that email passionate but the ones to you a little more guarded. Heartbreak does that. Maybe she came on too strong with pouring out emotions, the relationship ended, and she found that writing those deep emails was actually kind of a negative thing to that guy and assumed it was for you too?  


I would talk to her about how you're feeling because it sounds like maybe this one email to this old guy is bringing up other issues, it's more like you don't feel like she's expressing her love to you as fully as she could or in a way you need it expressed to feel loved. I am not even sure if you should bring up the email, but maybe if you do, do it gently like, ""when I was fixing up your tablet I synced your emails for you and accidentally saw something I thought was about me, but was about an ex. It was so passionate and heartfelt, it made me think about emails you've written to me, and how much I'd love to hear those words from you."""

Calling you ugly, saying it was like kissing a man, etc.? That's not a normal person who isn't expressing himself well. That's a straight-up asshole. I know relationships are complicated, but I couldn't stay with a man who felt that way about me getting a haircut, much less getting a haircut that was kind of necessary. Fuck him. Not literally, he'd like that, but seriously, move on."
"Yes. You (op) might just start feeling ready for this at 30, and 37 may be too late for her. I can see both sides. "
"I mean, in all honesty she's just a kid. And kids aren't great at consoling others when things like this happen. Losing a parent is probably so out of her realm of understanding that she literally doesn't know how to handle the situation. She could think that avoiding the issue all together is best because brining it up might be reminding you of it. She could definitely still care about it.

You should just speak to her and figure out what she's thinking, and why she doesn't seem to talk about it more. If you're such close friends, this should be how you handle these things. Communication is a two way street."
People adjust and learn by getting dumped for being an ass. 
"Only you can make the decision about terminating a pregnancy. If you decide to keep the baby, I think you should prepare for single motherhood. He is not reliable at this point in his life.

uhhh... what is your sense of the way he'd react if you told him he needed to get help? Does he seem like he has the potential to become a stalker? I know that kind of thing is very hard to predict but do you have a gut feeling either way?"
"&gt; What do you think I should do?

Break up with her and move on. 

It's obvious that you're the only one making any effort is this relationship, and that's just not right. Dump her and find someone who actually wants to spend time with you. "
"These people weren't really your friends anyway, so you haven't lost anything.  Start school and be friendly with everyone; be your confident self.  Everything will eventually fall into place.  I know it's easy for me to say 'be patient', but you haven't done anything wrong, and those people don't deserve your friendship.  You'll find some people who don't care about all that melodrama.  Make friends with them.  (FWIW, I had a ""best friend"" who dropped me in high school because of something ridiculous, so I just went on with my life like I didn't care.  She eventually came around to me.)"
"First off, is ex paying child support? If not, you need to get in front of a judge right away and get what’s owed to your family. Of course he can afford fun if he’s not paying any child support.  Then get to know him. Maybe he has changed. Either way it will only help things with your older son if you all get along. 

As for your younger son, how about him accompanying for a movie or amusement park. That way he gets to participate with his brother, but not be gone for an entire weekend. Then if it works you can expand into more. "
"&gt;Lastly, which happened yesterday, my husband said he wished we didn’t have the kids because “that was our lives would have been much better”.

YO. He just told you he regretted your kids! That is a *big deal*, and I feel like you're underreacting to this by quite a bit.

&gt;Or should I just brush it off?

if you do, you're going to get blindsided by him having an affair with a teenager or something equally stupid. This is an early mid-life crisis, and you and he need to take it seriously. counseling, like *immediately*."
"My ex was pulling the same bs. He always needed time and the answer was always next year, but it never came , just moved to yet another year. We lived together for almost 3 years and this conversation came up every couple of months and I was really unhappy. I couldn’t wait anymore because I did want to get married and have children and constant doubt and next year argument from him tired me. I broke up with him. Now I am with my fiance and I am 7 months pregnant. It is such a difference to be with someone who wants to be with you and shares your desires and goals. You deserve better, find someone else. "
"Your social worker? 

Sorry, this story is reading like someone who's at best socially unaware. That girl was outwardly cruel to you. I'm more concerned with people in your life telling you ridiculous things, like your mom telling you that you should still like her, or your social worker telling you that you're too upset about being jerked around like someone's play thing. 

You have a right to feel how you feel. But you don't have to hate her. The best thing you can do is stop giving a shit about her because she and her boyfriend are living trash bags. "
Yes you file for divorce.  You tell them daddy did something very bad and is being punished for it. You may also need to consider retaining a lawyer in case anyone tries to sue for financial damages now that they know who did this.
I think you are looking at it the wrong way.  I mean you used to fuck your boss’s girlfriend.
"You aren’t married, and even if you were, it is your fund, from your income. You made it clear what it was for. It was a big purchase, but it wasn’t really an impulse buy. I would have chosen something a little cheaper, but it is your money, your parents, and your gift. It’s really not any of his business."
"Go and visit your sister or mother or someone  for a week. 

Tell him that when you get back there needs to be some  serious changes made.  

Tell him he isn’t the boss of you and that you two will see a counsellor of your choosing when you return.  

Tell him he is too controlling, obsessive and demanding.  The silent treatment is totally unacceptable and the two of you cannot continue on the trajectory. "
"So basically he’s like “I hate you, look at how unstable you are— hey where are you going?? I’m not done emotionally abusing you yet!”

GTFO as fast as you can and don’t look back. It’s not even a commitment thing at this point, he’s just an asshole.

He probably liked that you kissed a girl because he could throw that back in your face literally every argument. Like if he’s got dirt on you he’s automatically got the moral upper hand."
"I’m not trying to say you should have made a different choice, but you have to be honest with yourself. You said he’s always been dodgy about doing his chores (see how that wording makes you sound like a mom?) and it took you years to get somewhere with him. "
"Hey, it's gonna be fine! Most STIs are very very treatable these days, as long as you actually do get them treated. It's not a big deal. It's icing on the shit cake for sure, but it's a very, very solvable problem.

edit: someone commented and then speed-deleted about HIV and AIDS, and yes, even HIV is very treatable--lots of folks live fairly normal lives with zero viral load thanks to newer medications. It's a lifelong illness but so is herpes, and it's not a death sentence anymore. We've come a long way in HIV treatment since RENT."
"I am so sorry you are in this position. It can be devastating mentally to feel like you are stuck in a rut permanently and working yourself to death for material things. 

Honestly, I don’t want to sound harsh but your wife is not contributing in a manner that she should. She goes out and shops and hangs out with her friends while spending the money that you work hard to earn at a job that you hate. I think you need to have a conversation with her and discuss settling new rules. Whether that has to be a weekly allowance for her or more expectations for her helping around the house is up to you. If you are in debt there is no reason that she can’t do the cooking/cleaning/landscaping instead of being a trophy wife all day. 

As for your children, 17 and 15 are great ages for them to start learning responsibility and getting jobs. They can earn their own money and pay for their extra fun things so that you can start to pay off your debt. Once your debt is paid down, I would consider downsizing your home. With a smaller house payment (or none at all!) perhaps then you could live out your dream of being a chef. 

But you have to get your wife on board financially. You won’t ever get out of your situation if she keeps spending your money on things you don’t even use. 

Until then I would try to fill your life up with more of what you love. If you love cooking, maybe have a family cooking competition during the weekends or perhaps volunteer to cook all the meals during those days. 

Life is hard. I hope it gets brighter for you, friend. "
"I don't want to scare you, but before my ex got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder one of the things we then saw as being a symptom was he would be convinced that I was getting up and doing other things during the night, when at most I'd gotten up to use the bathroom. He would also do things like stand around doors waiting/listening for movement and had disrupted sleep because of hallucinations/delusions. I would strongly urge you to get him to a doctor, especially as he is the right age for these types of things to start happening. Wishing you all the best x"
"&gt; well, am I being too prudish? 

No.

&gt; Is this normal behavior? 

No.

&gt; How would others girls in my situation respond and deal with this?

I can't speak for everyone, but I would have dumped him 4 years ago for this behavior."
"Is the reason the two of you do things you choose because you insist on getting your way (not so good for a relationship) or because your boyfriend doesn't come up with any ideas/options of his own?

It sounds like he's more of an introvert who would prefer hanging at home, eating takeout, to going out to a noisy activity with large crowds.

The issue I see is that he's pretty much convinced himself that he won't have fun, at this point.  Odds are that he will either be crabby the entire evening, that he'll back out again, or that he might even try to sabotage you going (for instance, make arrangements to pick you up and then show up late).

At this point, I recommend you contact him and tell him that it's obvious he really doesn't want to attend and that's perfectly okay.  But you don't want him uncomfortable or upset.  So it's best if you go alone with your friends and the two of you can get together to do something of his choosing on another day.  It's no problem.

If he argues, whines, complains, throws a fit, etc... (and very well may), that's a big flag.  An enormous flag.  Because that behavior is manipulative. And if he does this, there's no use in arguing.  Just give yourself a break from communication with him.

BTW, a reasonable partner would be disappointed not to see you but happy to make alternate arrangements for another day."
"hey man...

you have to realise, that it's not about what your family, or your girlfriend wants.

It's about what you want.

"Can I just say that YOU didn’t ruin anything. You didn’t ask to be born, or abandoned, or kept secret—none of it. That was all stuff that was done to you and your siblings. Please don’t ever blame yourself for things that were 100% out of your control. 

I’m glad to hear things are developing in such a promising way with your siblings and I hope everything goes well for you all in the future. Good luck!"

"""If only I knew how much it bothered him, I would’ve stopped the alimony.""

"&gt;he responded that they've already submitted a final headcount to their caterer so he has to invite someone

That's not how this works, like, at all. He can tell the bride and groom that he wasn't able to find a plus one / changed his mind about inviting someone who is not his partner. The bride and the groom can then fill the seat with a person of their choice. A friend, family member, or coworker of theirs who didn't make the cut but who might be available last-minute to attend the party anyway. I'm sure the bride and groom would rather choose who they want instead of having a complete stranger attend the wedding. 

You need to have a serious talk with him, that you know he's just making excuses, and he needs to tell you the real reason why he's acting this way. "

I dated a guy fresh out of a divorce, almost the same situation on his end. Really...we kinda healed together. Learned about ourselves and one-another. We got married 2 years ago and are pretty ridiculously happy together. It was hard to get here, but I'm so glad about how it all turned out."

And since you're so familiar with boundaries, how come you haven't set them and told her what they are?

Tell her to save her bikini questions for her boyfriend and stop liking pics you're calling revealing. Do YOU know what boundaries are? "
I think it might be good for you all to seek grief counseling.
"I already made one comment, but I came back, because the more I thought about it, the more disturbed I am by the tampering. The stealing is one thing. You're out of pills, but you're able to see that you're out, and you know you're not getting your medication. But the tampering is so much more disturbing. First of all, you have know idea what he put in the pill capsules to replace what he took. It could be anything. Then, there's the fact that if you didn't notice, you'd be taking your pills, assuming you're getting your medication when you're actually not, and so you might be feeling off (and I think most ADHD meds are ones that you're supposed to gradually taper off from, not just quit, so there's side-effects from going cold turkey, too) and not knowing why, thinking something is wrong with you. With just stealing, even if you couldn't replace them, you'd know why you're feeling the way you are. Instead he was sabotaging your health and mental well-being, letting you ingest whatever it was he put in those capsules - the ""best case scenario"" is that your pills would simply be ineffective, which is still a horrible thing to do you. The worst case scenario is that he put something in the capsules that could actually harm you."
"&gt; He's chewing through his inheritance

That's frustrating. But not the reason you can't afford a house. 

&gt;He browses Craigslist and other local boards so that he can get paid under the table and not have to pay income taxes or his student loans. He picks up a good amount of odd jobs like helping fix people's cars, painting houses, and yard and garden care but it's not consistent so his income is usually in the form of cash that he uses to buy his personal expenses like clothes and activities with his friends.

This is the reason you can't afford a house. He's your dependent. It's like raising a child who occasionally picks up jobs over the summer. Except this child also has student loans already, and also probably a cat figurine addiction. 

If you are buying his food, paying his rent, etc, then he is weighing you down. If you weren't supporting him financially and you weren't married, you could have probably saved up enough to buy your own house by now. He is financially sinking, and even his inheritance can't keep him afloat forever. And he will pull you down with him, because you're the only think preventing him from sinking even faster. 

I think you should try to see a financial advisor and a marriage counselor, because you are indeed married and it's the right thing to do. The goal would be to make him see that he needs to get a grown-up job and start contributing to the household and to savings. But honestly, I don't think he'll change. He's perfectly happy with the way things are, you enable him to not have to get a steady job, not have to pay for food or rent, not have to budget his inheritance, not to confront his cat figurine addiction, not to be a responsible adult.... He likes things the way they are. But you don't. You're miserable and realizing he is taking away your dreams of home ownership and financial stability. 

I would divorce him as soon as possible. You'll have so much more money in your pockets once you do. You can eventually buy your own house. And someday find a partner who is as financially stable as you are. "

"I'm on the spectrum too, and I've spent many, many years studying friendship. What I'm reading in this post is that you're making the same mistake over and over again; you're hanging out with people in large-group situations and then attempting to transition them all to intimacy immediately, without any steps in between. All of your events are also self-centered. Why should people who didn't know you a year ago and have only maybe chatted with you for 20 minutes at a mixer care about your suicide attempt? People build intimacy through shared confidences and experiences, and through being giving to each other. It doesn't sound like you've actually gotten to know any of your classmates. 

So no, do not bring it up. They're under no obligation to celebrate your events, hang out with you, or like you. If you want people to like you and care about you, you can't force them to. What you *can* do is be a generally decent human being without seeking credit for it, and you can ask them questions and try to get to know them individually and see if they start to become more interested in you as time goes on...but time is always going to be an element. It takes a long time to develop real friendships, and they don't always work out even after all the time and effort."
The first thing you need to do is have a real conversation with her about it. Everything until you do is just guessing from stranger's that don't know either of you.
"Tacking on something that also might be helpful in general: when you're inviting everybody, you're inviting nobody. That is to say, throwing your arms up and telling the room that they're all invited to this thing you're doing on the weekend gives the impression of an everyday, drop-in-if-you-like get together. People don't tend to give heads up when they can't/aren't planning on attending these, because it is assumed that their individual attendance isn't particularly important."

OP, I don't mean to be rude, but you should be ashamed of yourself if you're leaving your SO behind to spend time with your family. You have already created a life with this woman and you owe it to her to include her with your family. If they will not welcome her, let them know that means you do not feel welcome, either. You say family is important, so they (and you) should be treating your long-term, committed, almost-spouse partner as such."

"Sit Devin down and make it clear to her that you haven't taken any of her possessions and that this entire thing comes across as paranoid and crazy. Ask her if there is something wrong or going on with her. Frankly I'd be worried about her mental health at this moment.

She obviously has no proof so there's no way for her to pursue this. You're not in any trouble. But I'd worry about your safety since she seems to be developing extreme paranoid delusions and erratic behavior. Make sure you have a lock on your door, and if she starts to become violent at all, do not hesitate to call 911."

Also planning a wedding from 3 states away sounds like a nightmare.
"Time to call in the troops for a good old fashioned shaming.

He can scrub a toilet for a few months. Jesus.

Also, mother of 2 myself. I just read your post to my husband &amp; he had some serious not-nice words for him which I will not repeat here but yeah, your husband/apparent first born is being a dingle.

"You kinda buried the lead there.  Yes, your Dad's engaged to your Fiancee's mother.  That's unexpected but not a big deal.

The bigger deal is that your Dad intentionally stole your thunder, using your engagement dinner to announce his own engagement.  I'm kinda curious if Dad even paid for the bill for dinner, or if you got stuck paying for him to do this?

You're completely justified in being upset.  Try to separate your feelings about Dad having a relationship with your FMIL from your feelings about him stealing your engagement dinner.

You know your Dad, do you think it would be worth it to tell him that he upset you by ruining your engagement announcement?

You also need to guard against something similar happening in the future.  Don't give Dad or MIL details about wedding planning.  You don't want them trying to get you to change your plans or scheduling their wedding the day before yours or something.

If it's something you and your Fiancee might be interested in, consider whether eloping might get rid of some family drama. "
"Do not marry this person.

She doesn't care about getting married to you, she just cares about getting married.

She is pressuring you and berating you rather than **communicating** with you, which is what a good married couple should do. She can't do that, and she's not ready or mature enough to get married.


EDIT: To clarify, when you get married to someone, they should be telling you they want to marry **you** because they love you, because they love XYZ about you, because they love the life you've built together, and because they're excited to spend forever with you. **NOT** because ""all my friends are getting married."" She's literally more concerned with keeping up with the Jones's than she is about marrying you as a person. You deserve someone in your life who sees you as more than a status symbol/accessory."

seriously, *how*. How could they have ""fixed it"" without law enforcement getting involved? I know you don't want to put details into it but if this happened in a city, cameras are EVERYWHERE. Most likely, she would have gotten caught anyway. At least her lawyer can argue she came forward of her own free will.

Taking your pic down is the smoking gun. He's hooking up. 
"Noise canceling headphones.

When she touches you, it's okay to assert the boundary. ""Hey, Coworker, don't touch me."" If she does it again, say ""I've asked you not to touch me. Stop."" She may say something like ""you never said anything before!"" to which you say ""I'm saying it now. Stop.""

Talk to your manager and tell them that you're having trouble concentrating because she talks nonstop and keeps making excuses to touch you. Talk to HR again.

And start job searching. Just knowing you have options might help a lot."

"The ""we need to talk..."" is a cliche as a bad way to ask for a conversation, and is viewed as never being a good thing.  While her crying before knowing what was going on was exteme, I'm more inclined to cut her a break than the other posters here.  Especially since it seems like she waited until you met to talk to you about it instead of blowing up your phone trying to resolve it immediately.  Sure she jumped to conclusions, and that's not great, but it's also very human and she did seem to demonstrate some control and did own her reaction instead of making it all his fault.

It sounds like you handled it pretty well, and it's true that you'll probably make each other cry in the future if you are together long enough so not making promises you can't keep in that regard was very mature of you.  I don't think there is a need to make it up to her though, or anything you can do.  You already talked together about how to handle it better in the future and discussed the original topic you wanted to, so now you just need to move past it, time will help with that.  Sorry if that's not very helpful.  "
"Dude. I did the same with my GF at first. I’m a huge dnd player and love video games. I also lied and said I was going to a bar with friends when I would actually go tabletop role play. 

I’m a punk rock musician, so she had NO idea. I also dropped some hints to measure her reaction. Her answers were always kind of “i would die”. 

Then, things started getting serious. We started talking about moving together. 

So one day I made a whole fuss about “I need to tell you something”. We met for dinner and she was terrified, it wasn’t until that point that I actually realized how stupid the whole thing had become. So embarrassed as hell, I just told her about this whole geek side of me. She was actually fairly relieved, she later confessed she thought I would tell her I had another GF. 

If she loves you, she will learn to love to see you happy. Her first impression wasn’t the best either, but that actually makes it more valuable when I tell her I’m going to dnd with my friends. She learned that this is something very dear to me, and she just accepted it. Believe me, there are far worse things to confess to a GF than the fact you are a closet geek. 


Oh, by the way, she is my wife now and we are expecting twins :). She even said: “imagine when they will be old enough to role play with you”. My heart just melted at that comment and I realized I would spend the rest of my life with this girl. "
That sounds like a great use of a master's degree
"He never plays it outside of ""normal"" hours (always after 9am and before 10pm) so I didn't think I could call the police about it?

Thank you for the tip, I currently have been setting my phone to record whenever I have to go in or out in case he tries to confront me again. But if I don't engage at all that would be better, thank you."
"You mentioned absolutely nothing about actually wanting to go to treatment and wanting to recover. And no, recovering “for your boyfriend” is not recovery.

"This isn't about your brother, it's about your parents.


If there was a set of twins where both were cognitively typical, and the parents threw them separate parties because they are individuals, that would be fine. 


But it seems like your parents are completely ignoring their son with a disability. Is he getting a special dinner or anything from your parents where he gets to choose who comes?


Don't go out to the birthday dinner for your non-disabled brother and instead say you have plans celebrating disabled brother's birthday and take him out."

"Dude, this girl NEEDS to be an ex. What are you thinking? You didn't even officially propose and you just rolled with it? She wants to get married same-week and you want your family to come and you let her steamroll you? This girl is literally insane. This is not a reasonable or equitable relationship and I have some serious questions about your self-esteem.

End this for good. She is using the shit out of you."
"First of all - what? This is so weird. As I was reading it I had assumed you were both gay men and you just weren’t interested in him romantically. When I was around 18 I had a friend who would make me feel uncomfortable in a similar manner. She was a few years older and had an open relationship with her husband, anytime we’d hang out she would make comments that made me feel uncomfortable (it never involved inappropriate touching though) and eventually I stopped making plans with her.

I would set some ground rules for expectations living together. “I do not want to split the cost of food, I will buy my own. I pay rent here so I can invite whoever I want to spend the night in my room. Please stop touching me, it’s making me uncomfortable - if you don’t think you can live with any of this, just tell me so I can start to look for a new living situation because this is not working for me”. 

I’m sorry you’re dealing with this it sounds extremely uncomfortable."
"&gt; How do I face this man in court knowing full well he did exactly what he did and face that frankly predatory look of his? 

Don't look at him.  Look at the judge, or look at the jury.  You are telling your story.  It's important, and you deserve the chance to tell your story.

Don't buy the bullshit that the attorney is smart, and has the control. 

You are the witness.  You have the power, you are in control.  Not the judge, not the attorney, not the guy on trial - his balls are in a sling.

The opposing attorney wants to make you uncomfortable.  They like to ask questions quickly, in order to encourage quick answers.

You can take a breath whenever you need.  You have the power.  You can ask them to repeat a question whenever you need.  If they ask a long question, ask for it to be shorter, that you don't understand.

You should think the phrase ""Wait a minute."", quietly to your self, after *every* question.  That gives YOUR attorney time to object to the question before you start answering.  Give your attorney that chance.

Make your answers as short as possible.  Think about what the question states, and give the information, and only that information.

Have you done 'direct examination' yet?  Where your attorney asks the questions to you?

Ask me anything - I testify as an expert witness once in a while.  Have I mentioned that you have the power?  You do!

"Just this week someone crossing the street in a hit and run. From my apartment we heard the sound of the impact and thought it was two cars. But no, a person was hit. It was night, the driver was speeding, the person was just crossing the street

They could have been killed. We were out there while the cops showed up. You could hear screaming.

Whoever that person is, they face a serious road of pain, medical bills, rehabilitation, and potentially a total and complete change to their life.

And whoever did it ran off. Didn't check to see if they were ok, just left.

No amount of anxiety ever makes what she did ok. Had she stayed things would have been different. But the running is the kicker here.

I really hope they catch the person who hit the person crossing the road. I hope they have to face the consequences of their actions.

Tbh i would not have your phone out.

"&gt;Kicking an underage child (meaning under 18 in most states) out of the house, without the child being emancipated, can often be considered child abandonment, which is a crime.

"I wouldn't tell him. Your Dad knows the circumstances around when you were conceived, so he logically knows there is a chance you are not biologically his child. I'm guessing that because you have very different features from your siblings that deep down he knows, but has chosen to ignore it. I would also think that if he really wanted to know, there would have been a paternity test. Whatever the case may be, his actions throughout your life have indicated he doesn't really have an interest in acknowledging the chance that somebody else is your biological dad and I would respect that. Bringing it up may only hurt him and possibly change your relationships with your siblings. "

"This reminds me of Steven Moffat, the former showrunner for *Doctor Who*, and the current showrunner / writer for BBC's *Sherlock*. He also once made an unfunny 'joke' about no longer being attracted to his pregnant wife because she ""got fat"". 

&gt; ""Your wife turns into a boat, and shortly after that, you never sleep again, and you clean shit off someone. It doesn’t seem like a very appealing prospect. Obviously, the moment I saw my child, that was different, but up until that point, I was thinking, ‘how long before she gets back to normal size? Will this damage anything?'""

Based on Moffat's highly questionable comments about women in general, it makes me question if OP's husband also has similarly...*questionable* views.

Moffat also had this to say about actress Karen Gillan:

&gt; ""And I thought, ‘well, she’s really good. It’s just a shame she’s so wee and dumpy…When she was about to come through to the auditions, I nipped out for a minute, and I saw Karen walking on the corridor towards me, and I realised she was 5’11, slim and gorgeous...and I thought, ‘Oh, oh that’ll probably work’."""
"It sounds like you both are approaching the relationship without a lot of goodwill for each other - you’re both resentful about your contributions and don’t feel like the other is holding up their end. It also sounds like you’ve both been under a lot of stress and haven’t had much time to enjoy each other’s company.  Maybe you’re sniping at each other because you’re stressed out?  Or maybe this relationship has run its course and you can both feel it. 

It is really hard to tell from a post like this whether the problem is you or him or both.  Any OP obviously has a personal bias, and you’re summarizing months of your life into a few anecdotes - readers may latch on to one detail and be completely oblivious to really important information that wasn’t included in the post.  My sense is that the problem is usually both people to some degree, but sometimes it really is just one or the other.  

If you think this is a situation where you two just haven’t been appreciating each other enough, try to set aside some low stress time to do that.  Enjoying each other’s company can smooth over a lot of minor frictions.  And hopefully your extremely stressful schedule is a temporary thing.  

I think it is good for you to both productively communicate with each other about the things that have you feeling unappreciated and resentful. Try to have those conversations when you’re both in good moods. Maybe you both are coming from a reasonable place on that and can work with each other to deal with those feelings.  Maybe one or both of you isn’t reasonable - you should give him the benefit of the doubt in these talks, but also ask yourself “do I want to live like this”?  If you think he’s fundamentally unreasonable, you should end the relationship.  "
"According to the CDC:

&gt;A Toxoplasma infection occurs by:

&gt;Eating undercooked, contaminated meat (especially pork, lamb, and venison).

&gt;Accidental ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat after handling it and not washing hands thoroughly (Toxoplasma cannot be absorbed through intact skin).

&gt;Eating food that was contaminated by knives, utensils, cutting boards and other foods that have had contact with raw, contaminated meat.

&gt;Drinking water contaminated with Toxoplasma gondii.

&gt;Accidentally swallowing the parasite through contact with cat feces that contain Toxoplasma

So, you don't eat undercooked meat, but there is a *lot* of cross contamination in kitchens. Plus, if you eat out, you literally don't know if someone prepared your meal with contaminated hands or utensils. 

So while it's tempting to blame your awful neighbors and their cats, you actually don't know if they're to blame.

"Parents hate it when people without children say anything negative about their parenting, even if they are right. Especially if they're right! 



Unfortunately, yelling at a child is not considered abuse and CPS will not likely investigate over this. You can make a report if you want but it's not high priority - and you also risk alienating yourself from your niece if you do this, as SIL will suspect someone in the house and throw a fit probably. 


My suggestion is to offer to help your SIL more and approach her with understanding instead of judgement. She likely doesn't have the tools to behave better in periods of extreme stress (which she perceives her toddler as). Knock on the door and say things like, ""Hey, I can hear you over here - is everything okay? You sound really upset, can I help/do you want to talk?"" Just casually chat her up, ask her what's going on, and drop hints about counseling and such where appropriate. Maybe even do things like exaggerate your own experiences in childhood to help SIL relate and empathize with her child. 

""Oh no, she wet the bed? I remember I used to do that when I was little - it was because I was too scared to get up by myself at night time. I was really sensitive as a little one haha. Remember how everything was just so much bigger than we were? Gosh that was a rough time! I'm glad I had mommy to cuddle me and make everything okay...sometimes I still want to cuddle my mommy! You ever feel like that? Oh, to be young again!""


People just forget what it was like to be a child, and they end up creating adult expectations for people who are just learning how the world works. When I notice someone having a problem with frustration in childrearing, I find it really helps to talk to them in a way that re-frames the situation so they lower their expectations in the moment, if that makes sense at all?


"
"Except it sounds like you had to fight with him to get him to do chores at all. So there is a precedent of him thinking that chores are not for him to do. Has he ever suggested or outright said that chores are ""women's work"", or that maintaining the house is your job, not his?"
"It sounds like she's a ""family friend,"" and is not especially closer to you than she is to any other of your family? Your GF seems interpret it as ""your friend, F"" being treated as one of the family because of YOUR relationship with her, and she feels that should be the GF's role, but she's failing to consider that your family doesn't treat F like one of the family because of F's relationship with YOU, individually. They treat F like one of the family because she's a ""family friend,"" not just YOUR friend who they've come to accept. So try explaining it that way - you and your family all got to know F together. She just happens to be your age, but you and F are not the primary connection - it's a family-wide relationship. 

There's not much else you can do. Don't feel you need to apologize for it. Explain it, then tell your GF that you love her, and you are not going to cut off F, and if she has insecurities about that, it's something she needs to work on within herself. Then refuse to discuss in anymore. If she insists on bringing it up repeatedly, tell her you've already settled it, you're not changing your mind or discussing it further, and if she can't accept it, then it must be a deal-breaker for your relationship, and that's okay."
"The thing is, he *knows* he's hurting you and he keeps doing it.  Sometimes, people are clueless about how they are coming across and the effect it has, but he is obviously very cognizant and does it anyway.  This is a bad sign.

"What my wife and I do is 75% immediately goes into a joint account, from both of our paychecks. This is used for savings, rent, food, etc shared expenses, and everything out of this account is discussed. So for example I wanted to buy a new oven/stove top for both of us, it was expensive because I'm a food snob, so we sat down and both discussed whether to sign off on spending our shared money on a stove. From that account, we manage it together. 

For the 25%, it's our personal bank account. This means we can do what we want with it. Obviously we'll give each other crap sometimes like when I was going to buy myself a new gaming pc to build, or when she can't stem her sephora addiction, but we each have autonomy. If I want to spend my 25% paying to eat out everyday with coworkers, that's my choice, because we are both giving adequate money to our shared future together and our current expenses are paid, so why not?

I recommend doing this - shared should not be 100% shared in my opinion until you two are really basically very close in values and attitudes. And there is nothing wrong with NOT being at that point at 24 years old. 

Sit down and make a plan. Tell her your concerns, and also tell her that you respect her financial autonomy. Make sure each of you has a ""whatever the fuck I want"" account with enough money to enjoy a few coffees and makeup, but not enough to stress the other person out. "

"You are not a terrible person or a terrible parent for not wanting to be a single parent. 

If I were you, I would push for a shared custody agreement where your ex has your child 50% of the time. You may be single but you are not the only parent here, and there's no reason you should act like the only parent."
Yes it's 100% true. 
"You are already doing everything well. Tell her you believe in her. Tell her she deserves peace and a good life. Tell her you love her. 
That’s all. You’re an excellent brother. You can’t save her, you can just encourage her to save herself."
You're about to marry an abusive man.
"She is paying constant attention to another human being for 12+ hours a day. It’s understandable that when you get home she jumps at the chance to have even just one hour with nobody looking at her, touching her, needing things from her, talking to or at her, crying at her, yelling at her, or generally making demands on her physically, emotionally and mentally.

I’m curious why she’s turning down the idea of a babysitter. Does she think she will have “failed” as a mom if she’s getting regular child care? Or would she just rather have time alone without a babysitter, than get a babysitter and lose some of her alone time (albeit to spend time with you)? Does she not want to spend the money? Something else?

If you can swing the cost of a babysitter, maybe look into whether one of your jobs offers an EAP that you could potentially use for free or low-cost couples counseling."
"&gt; I don't want any money from his mom, but if she is going to be supplementing his income, I feel like he should be providing it to the family, not using it to shop for himself.

How about this one?  ""I don't care that he's taking advantage of his mother, I just want it to benefit me, too!"""
"&gt;What do I get out of it? I guess companionship.

Get a cat.

Jokes aside, he seems very nonchalant about using your money as he pleases, so much so that he could not be bothered to sort out his reservations in time ""because you would pay for it anyway"". I would not stand for it personally. No offense, but are you sure you are more than a bank to him? Try going split finances for a while and see if he is still willing to stick around."
"Every time you see the creepy smile think, ""Yes, THAT smile. It proves you're a creep, which is why we are here. To put you in jail. Now you just keep that smile on, let the jury see you looking that way. No way will they think you have any remorse or humanity. You are toast. """
two failed relationships

"You might need to so the most painful thing imaginable: just ask the question. First, it'll save you a lot of time of feeling unsure of everything. Second, if he's already made up his mind that you moving makes a breakup easier (and that's what he's planning on), depending on the type of person he is, he may just open up on how he feels.

A lot of people stay together because they live together. Living together and breaking up is just WAY more complicated.

I don't know the extent of your relationship beyond your post but based on what you wrote it sounds like you're thinking the same thing."
"Please keep us updated on this story, i have no advice but would love to hear what happens on the 'wedding day'"
"If your wife still needed a chance to sow her wild oats she probably wouldn’t have married you.

You weren’t ready at 26, but you also weren’t married, probably didn’t own a home or have your career figured out, all of which you and your wife now have.

26 is the average age for women to have children in the US, but you’re acting like she’s a teenager."
"It's alright. It's very understandable that you feel shocked and hurt. He doesn't have a valid complaint to bring up and being excited about his children is not part of your job, so bringing it up to management at all would be petty and dumb on his part. If he takes it that far, just tell your side of the story to management. "
"Currently 8 months pregnant, closest I can describe is like those day-long hangovers you get in your 30s on top of starting a new workout routine yesterday and you’re sore all over. Also you sleep like shit. Send him to CrossFit and make him drink a 12-pack. Wake him up randomly at night. "
"&gt;but breaking up over punctuality feels so, so stupid. 

Wherever you got this is, it's wrong. Chronic tardiness is disrespectful. She has absolutely no respect for you, your time, your comfort, or your effort. I'm willing to bet real money though, that she'd blow up on you if your treated her the same way.

I wouldn't give her an ultimatum, or give her a chance to change, or try to make it work. With people this immature it takes several dumpings before they even think of changing. 

I'd break up with her and, if she promises to change, tell her that, as usual, she's too late."
"The two of you sound entirely incompatible, and furthermore he sounds like a jerk. He's giving you the silent treatment because you didn't park in the exact spot he thinks you should park in? This sort of controlling behavior only gets worse, especially without therapy.

If I were you, I'd be planning my exit."
"She has tons of cookbooks... collecting dust on the shelf on top of the stove. She says they give ""professional aesthetic"" to the kitchen. The most recent one I bought her fell into the soup about two days ago"
"&gt;And then you'll have kids. And she will start to groom them and abuse them too.

This needs to be the biggest point made in this thread. And that shit about her getting into bed with the brother and he and hi mom groping under clothes, belly, thighs, all of that? WTF????????!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"No ,you don't owe him anything other than not speaking to him. Does your husband even like his father? Why can't you cut this guy out of your lives? He's not a jokester. He's an abusive asshole."
"OP is responsible for her husband, an independent, grown adult, lying to her 🧐 you sure?

He may well fear her reaction, but he’s choosing to lie. "
"&gt; What kind of combined finances do you have?




Paychecks go into a joint account. We use that joint account for everything - bills, personal spending, etc. 



I'm leaning towards keeping a joint account that we'll deposit x dollars on each paycheck for bills / mutual expenses, while having our paychecks go into new personal accounts. "
"Hold up. Did you INVITE them, or did they just tell you they are coming? If they invited themselves without consulting you, you are in no way responsible for housing them. It doesn't matter if you have 3 bedrooms or not. ""I'm sorry, it won't work for us for everyone to stay here. Here is a list of affordable hotels nearby."""
Oh dear. I think this flag might be red. 
"What you've written is super ironic. You say you don't understand how people can ""just ditch a partner because of a single flaw,"" yet go on to say you ditch prospects right off the bat for ""not clicking""...AFTER THE FIRST DATE!

You are looking at the land across the sea...but you're not even willing to build a boat to get there. House, long term career, family? Why not calm down and just focus on getting to know *her* - whoever it is, across the table, looking at you on your first date - first. Make a connection, focus on the small things, be comfortable, laugh! See her as a fellow human being and friend, not a list of qualifications that must be checked off. You wouldn't believe how much that will help both of you feel comfortable. It is then, and only that chemistry can happen."
"I rarely recommend involving an outside party in a relationship but this sounds like something you aren’t going to make him realize alone. Is there a older couple that you both look up to that has children? I would reach out to them and ask for help. 


It sounds like he is being childish and/or has unrealistic expectations of you. Talking to someone who has already been through this would help."
"Your sister is being unfair, and she’s probably actually upset because her husband is a jerk who disrespects women. (I notice he doesn’t shoot you in the face with the nerf gun.)
"
Stephen Moffat’s misogyny is crystal clear in his writing/show running. I quit Dr Who and Sherlock because he ruined them.

"If it helps, usually these extreme measures are taken to correct a swing in the other direction. That is, no one really expects you to be lovey dovey happy clappy, it's just that a year or two ago they had some teams/exit reviews/whatever that were too far in the other direction - jaded, disengaged, whatever. The hope is that you'll all wind up more or less in the middle. Don't take it too seriously. I promise, aside from maybe one or two junior idealists in HR, no one else is. You do need to drink the Kool Aid a little, but only a little. "
This seems like an incompatibility. There's a lot going on here. He has no right to limit your masturbation and I honestly don't know why you would have ever agreed to that with your high libido. I also don't know why you'd go through with a sex act that you knew made him uncomfortable. This is on both of you.
"That was my thought as well, but I thought I was being a nutter butter and making mountains out of molehills. Guess we're having a sit-down talk tonight. "
"I honestly don't know and that's why I'm asking (I need to clear up the OP, my bad) I've never encountered anyone who truly believed the bar tender was talking into a secret microphone to a van outside because he was part of a government operation to track my date. 

This guy did..."
If you can't afford to give the child a good life on your own and you don't expect anyone to help you I think you have your answer (even though you may not like it). Bringing a child you can't afford into the world is not fair to you and it's double not fair to the child. 
"So he expects you to sit at home, twiddle your thumbs, and wait for him to come back?

Go on your trip girl."
Are you familiar with Captain Awkward? I would want you to read post 506 &amp; 507 (Google **Captain Awkward chores** to find the post). It's such a huge power play to abdicate all household responsibility when your partner is 7 months pregnant that I'm at a loss for other advice.
Have you tried talking to her directly? 
"I think the pneumonia is affecting you more than you think. You're calling your abusive ex your fiance.

In all seriousness I hope you get better soon. Already the great people in your life (like your kids). Dump the fiance. You deserve better."
"&gt;He put his hands around my neck once but later convinced me that it was my fault 

END YOUR MARRIAGE. Your husband is abusive. "
"First, digital cloud.

Get the tapes uploaded so that you will always have access to them at any time, anywhere in the world.

That should handle a bit of the anxiety.

Then yeah maybe therapy, maybe just someone to talk to regularly that’s in a similar spot. I wouldn’t say what you are doing is strange by any means. My wife and kids are fine and I still watch their videos and stuff and they are just upstairs. 

Do what you feel comfortable with in the time that you feel it’s right."
I really love your point that a woman is carrying out all the labor of a NICU to grow and maintain a 3rd trimester baby. Brilliant.
"Yikes. I actually forgot the ages and thought this was someone in their mid to late teens. 

Op, uninvited him and go have a wonderful time with your friends. If you let him get away with this once, it’ll continue happening. "
I'd be pissed as hell if someone called me selfish because I didn't want an orgy.
"As heartless as this sounds, you need to move on. He already has. Cancel anything you have planned together and get rid of anything that reminds you of him.

It's never easy when you find out somebody you trust has been lying to you, but there's no going back from what he did. Start planning your life without him and don't look back."
"You need to restructure how you do finances. You can keep joint accounts for your actual joint expenses (&amp; outline what these are - bills, groceries, etc). You can also keep a joint savings for your long term goal of purchasing a house. Agree how much money each of you put into each account per paycheck, &amp; agree that no money comes out except for the agreed upon items. Then do separate accounts where some money from each paycheck stays. His account can be saved up for cat figurines. Yours can be spent of whatever hobby you enjoy. 

That being said, I think you’re beyond just switching up your accounts. Your husband is severely outspending his means. He also may have some hoarding tendencies. (Hoarders can also buy really nice stuff - it’s not just people that don’t throw away any of their trash.) Thid part needs counseling. "
"Even if she isn't having an affair (which she probably is), they need to talk. She's spending at least 1/4 time away from him and the relationship with no explanation, and their bedroom is dead. Affair or not, their relationship is circling the drain. "
"No, he's just a leech. He has no problem taking what you offer, but he refuses to offer anything after 7 years. It's never going to get better with this guy. You've already wasted most of your 20s with him. The sooner you get out, the sooner you'll find someone you can build a future with."
"Coming from a family where the only reasons to move out were for college or marriage, I feel your pain. Unfortunately, it is their house, so you have to follow their rules. You mention that you have the means to move out, which I would highly recommend doing. I know that if I had the means to move out of my family home earlier, I would have taken the opportunity to do it. My relationship is much better with my parents after I got out from under their thumb. Your parents might/will get upset with you leaving, but that is not your fault. "
"Yep. You’re an adult - you can move out on your own as well as decide when you want to move out. Are you really saying, “I’m 23 and I can’t move out because Mommy and Daddy wouldn’t like it?”"
"Usually when I feel like this something else is going on. For me it’s that I’m super tightly wound and stressed about work or living in a big city and not doing enough to unpack that and unwind. 

Whenever I find myself thinking my SO is too bland/too meek/makes annoying sounds/isn’t sexy, I always try to do a relaxing weekend getaway together. It usually resets my stress levels and helps us connect and I remember why I like him. 

Obviously there are the tangible issues like picking up after himself etc. But the overall irritation factor could be stress related. "
"&gt;TL;DR! Someone I consider a sister was catfished after booking a one way ticket to see him and she assumed she could stay with me for a month. Her behavior has been hurtful and I don’t know if I can salvage our friendship.

OP it takes two people to keep a relationship running smoothly. Given her behavior as described, it's not on you to salvage it - you've been bending over backwards to accommodate her. What, precisely, has she put into this relationship, other than demands on your time, energy, and money? What is SHE doing to salvage your friendship?

Just a framing exercise you might find helpful"
"Man, I’m gonna need a picture of your mega-hot husband who makes these women act like animals (totally joking if that’s not obvious haha).

Seriously though, it sounds like your husband is a great guy (even if it took him a little bit to catch on in this case) and I’m so sorry you keep getting flung into precarious situations with him!  The lady in the above comment sounds like a real piece of work, you certainly seem like a much more gracious and patient woman than I could ever be.

Was calling him a pedophile part of her master plan to flirt and make him leave you? Hah.  What an odd series of actions.  The way some people act out when they don’t get their way absolutely baffles me.

All the best to you both!  Sounds like y’all don’t need it though :)"
"Please do an update, I’m so intrigued about this. I used to date a guy who literally made up everything about himself, and I found out at the end that he was a wanted felon. "
"As another female who worked in the video game industry, I feel you.

I would just be straight up with him. “Look, bud. It seems like you’re awfully defensive about me beating you in this game, what gives?”

If he makes excuses and continues to be defensive, tell him: “I feel like you’re invalidating my skills as a gamer because I am female. I dealt with that enough in the industry and I shouldn’t have to deal with that from a partner.”

For me personally, it’s about respect. For me, it would be a major issue if my dude was threatened by the fact I am a decent gamer. That tells me that he doesn’t respect me as a person. Because to be beaten by a -girl- is shameful for the sole fact we are female. I have plenty of guy friends who I game with that are totally okay if I beat their ass at a game. And I’m totally okay if they kick my ass. Because it’s a game. Being good or bad at it has no bearing on my or their self worth. 

Luckily, I’m a big ol’ lesbian so I’ve been fortunate that I haven’t had to deal with this sort of attitude/behavior from a partner. 

I wish the best for you. Hopefully, he is receptive and y’all have a productive conversation. 

**EDIT** He could also just be a sore loser. Which is a huge turn-off. But my advice remains. Just be straight up and ask him why this threatens his ego. Because it clearly does. "
This is literally the definition of settling... accepting you're not going to work for something you want. He obviously still wants kids.
"Dont go to the party. Take the twin to his own party.

I'm sorry you got stuck being the responsible one. It sucks. But you have your own life to live now."
"I think you're right when you say she doesn't understand what your job is or how stressful it is.

You are absolutely okay to tell her you need a few days--even a week--to vegitate and do nothing. This is your vacation, not hers. Her life will essentially remain the same during it. And as long as you help out and assist her once you feel recharged enough to function, you are totally justified in taking same time off.

I suggest something like this.

""Wife, I know you want me to take over the household chores once I take my vacation. I am more then willing to help, but the first week will be dedicated to recharging and getting some sleep. I know it's hard to explain how stressful my job is when I can't bring you to see it, but I need you to believe me when I say I say I am physically and mentally burned out. If I don't have time to relax and recharge then the rest of our time together while I'm on vacation will be no fun at all, and I will got back to work more--not less--stressed out. I would really appreciate your understanding here.""

Edited to say: you should also consider communicating more of your daily work life (to the extent that you can) to her, so she can gain a better understanding of where your stress and tiredness comes from. It might just be she doesn't know -at all- how rough you're feeling because your job is a total mystery."
"Hmmm... ok the combo of the bobby pins, q-tip, AND picture make me think he is cheating on you. His excuses also seem very, very poorly thought-out. Also bobby pins flying out of his bed are a whole other issue. Unless he hasn’t made his bed in over six months, there is something really suspicious about that. And if he hasn’t made his bed in six months, please dump him for poor hygiene. 

Also: who leaves a bra in a hook-up’s apartment? I don’t know if that was a recent find or not, but IMO that’s my biggest evidence that he’s cheating. No girl leaves behind a $60-$150 bra in a stranger’s apartment unless they intend to come back for it."
"Yeah OP, the big problem here is that your BF is not on Team You here. He seems to be assuming that you're just, like, mildly annoyed about these things and if he stays here then *of course* you'll stay too, because Love or something.

Tell him you're moving out ASAP, and he can either come with you or start planning how he's going to handle rent on his own.

Edited to add: I know you're probably really angry that all the things he said turned out not to be true, but if you can, I would try to take the high road here and put that resentment aside. It sounds like the landlord lied about the utility bills, and getting good or bad neighbors is honestly a gamble. The big problem here isn't that your BF was wrong about these things, it's that he doesn't care that you're miserable."
"With the hubby I'd say ""This isn't working. Let's figure out a reasonable date by which she has to find someplace else to live."" Then communicate that information to her together. "
"I think Emily’s impending wedding is going to do a lot to further inflame the issue of where your dad’s loyalties lie — both because of the more superficial issue of whether he’s even invited, and the sort of torturous existential question of how can he honestly celebrate that milestone with her knowing he’s failed her so thoroughly. I’m sure you don’t need to be told this, but brace yourself for a divorce, because “keep quiet” is not sustainable."
"The chances of a 64 year old racist liar having changed materially must be near-zero. Unless maybe he found God or had a near-death experience.

I think your plan is very good:  meet up  (you, hubby,  no kids) and test the waters. Just because you've met once doesn't commit you to any future meetings. (And if he's just after your organs he can fuck off. *Or as u/I_am_photo suggests, he just wants back in to  grandpa's Trust Fund.*)"
"Talk to your fiancé. Get him on the same page with you. Then have him start setting healthy boundaries.

""I'm sorry mom, but it is inappropriate for anyone other than the bride to wear red.""

""I'm sorry mom, but my bride will be the only one with bridal henna at my wedding.""

""Let me be clear mom. This is /u/cookiesaresoyummy's day, then mine, and then everyone else's. I will do everything it takes to make sure that it is perfect for her. Sis will be taken care of, but not at my future wife's happiness.""

etc.

---

If it isn't clear, he has to set the boundaries.

1. it's good practice for the future
2. they are his family
3. if he fails at this, this is going to be an ongoing issue, and you are better off knowing about it now, when you can do something about it.
    * Note: you are far from ultimatum time. Hopefully you can just talk to him, he will get it, and he will make it right.

Just as ""good fences make good neighbors""^[1] good boundaries make for happy families.

"Has your GF suffered any sort of abuse that you’re aware of?

Victims of abuse or people that are suffering from severe trauma will often regress. They keep things around or hold on to items from the time before abuse because it feels safe and comforting. 

I still have a stuffed animal from my childhood that I love dearly. I think lots of people have something like that, but this seems to be to an extreme extent. "

"shit. OK. all of this depends on how safe you feel, OK? your safety should be your first priority, THEN his health. OK so ideally, you would tell him directly that you think he is showing signs of clinical paranoia with possible delusions of persecution and tell him he needs to see a psychiatrist. But obviously, people with clinical paranoia are generally *not* going to hear you or take you seriously. If you feel safe doing it, you could tell his family. other people have said they're probably aware of his delusions but they might not be, it's possible these are new delusions and they don't know yet.

"Don't pay for their hotel rooms. They are the ones who screwed up their own plans by assuming they could freeload at your place, their assumption shouldn't cost you anything.

"Don’t stress about the conversation. He’s seen the grocery bills. You are in a committed relationship, you need to both learn how to communicate with each other, because there will be many more, much worse conversations to be had in your lives.

I think this low key food conversation is good practice. If he blows up and can’t have an adult conversation about an issue that is causing you to be unhappy, then I think you have a bigger problem than going broke feeding him."
There could genuinely be a bill. I suggest that you work DIRECTLY with the hospital if you decide to help. Do not give her any money whatsoever.
"I think during meal times, and a few other times when you're all together (like doing an activity), the common language should be spoken. But if they're just hanging out casually, speaking their native language in front of you is okay. But it would also be okay for you to bow out of those ""hang-outs"" and go do your own thing, since they're not including in those conversations. You could also use those times as lessons - listen for an occasional word you understand, and look up a few other words you hear, then try to guess what they were saying, occasionally ask for an interpretation of what they said, too. "
"Wow your boyfriend is an awful person. He publicly cheated on you for 2 years! But he thinks the worst part of this is you messaging his friends?? 

What a loser. Leave his sorry ass today. "
"Seriously. This should be the top answer.

OP, the issue isn't separating finances. The two of you need to be able to have an adult conversation about spending habits if you're planning to spend your lives together."
"His wishy-washy behavior has got to be driving you nuts.  And the whole ""if you have time for it"" is passive agressive guilt-inducing manipulation.

Do yourself a favor on the day you go out:  Turn off your phone.  Take it with you but leave it completely powered down.  

Because I'll bet you dollars-to-donuts that he contacts you either shortly before you go out and/or while you're out.  That contact might range from ""What are you doing?"" to ""When are you going to be home?"" but in actuality it's about control.

Leave your phone off and see what messages you have when you get home.  If he contacted you multiple times, getting more and more upset, run for the hills."
"God grief OP!  This guy has zero respect for you or your needs.  At only 8 weeks in, he is controlling, demanding, and manipulating.  He's selfish, self-absorbed and also disrespectful of your home, not just you.

"Her and my dad have drifted a lot. My dad sleeps in the spare room now when he’s home. I think he’s mostly mad at himself for not noticing before and ignoring what he did notice. I think he doesn’t know what to do, and can’t imagine leaving my mom. Mostly because she takes care of everything while he’s away for work. I mean I’m not gonna lie, I don’t want my parents to get divorced and break up what we do have left. I know that’s selfish but it’s still how I feel. My mom hasn’t really changed. When Emily first left, she said they’d had a small fight but Emily was being dramatic. Her and my dad fought a lot and now she’s just kept quiet about the whole thing. Even when we went to visit my sister for her graduation. "
You can say that again
"&gt;He gets one chance not to be an asshole

I'm pretty sure not secretly getting engaged to your son's future mother-in-law was that one chance. Why is everyone in this thread ignoring how deceptive and creepy this behavior is? That relationship is something that should have been discussed with OP months ago, yet OP's dad decided to reveal it at a public event with no build up for maximum shock value.

&gt;it feels like he purposefully announced his engagement to my fiancee's mother so that I couldn't marry my own fiancee.

Yeah, this isn't just a ""whoops my bad"" moment from the father. If this story is real, then OP's dad is either plotting something or a narcissistic sociopath who's unable to consider how his actions might affect other people."
"When I and another person have made the choice to find an apartment together, we were both responsible for researching and figuring everything out. When it all falls on one person, you increase the likelihood that someone will be disappointed. So take some ownership and avoid playing the blame game. Also, while your boyfriend argued in favor of the place, that doesn't mean you lost your free will. You could have negotiated for a different place or neighborhood so that both of you could get what you wanted. Next time, come up with a more fleshed-out ""must-have"" list. 

Keep in mind that the noise level of an apartment building is not just a function of the kind of residents who live there, but also the building construction. I used to live in a jumbo highrise tower made out of concrete. There were kids and pets all over the place, but the noise was tolerable. But in the small apartment building I used to live in, the walls and floors were paper-thin.  So keep that in mind when you go apartment-hunting."

"Actually this is tame compared to an ex-neighbor of ours. She stared at him while he was cutting the grass, flirted with him in front of me, watched him go running in the morning, called him a pedophile because we were both 15 when we got pregnant with our daughter, and on July 4th last month, called the cops to report a suspicious guy talking to teenage girls when she saw him watching our girls and their friends playing on a playground. The only reason he was even watching them is because our 8 year old has mobility issues, and she knew that. All of this happened because he wasn't interested in her.

I just think there's something in the water here that makes people a little nutty, because none of this has happened anywhere else we've lived, haha."
"My husband suffered from extreme anxiety for 20 years because his parents are anti doctors and medicine.   I finally convinced him to see a psychiatrist and a therapist.  Within 3 days of starting lexapro it was like night and day for him 

Now he still is working through stuff and has a bad day or week, but it's 110% better.  He wishes he had done it sooner, but it's hella hard to do if you have people in your life who are unsupportive. "
"He is not a step- up from you.


I need you to know that people aren't ranked. He is just a person, with achievements and failures and flaws just like you. He's young and maybe not an effective manager. You said he orders you around but try not to take it personally. He sees you as a friend, co worker, subordinate, threat to his relationship, and also probably feels a bit awkward about the situation. As another poster mentioned, he's dating someone significantly younger. When I was 24, my friends and I would definitely make fun of guys who dated 19 year olds. There's just a huge maturity difference at that age, especially for girls. She's not perfect either  and it turns out you weren't right for each other. 


You said he's a good guy, and prior to this you were friends. Don't try to be his best bud , but try your best to forgive him and move on. Focus on your work and yourself. You worked so hard to get this job and it sounds like a great thing to have on your resume. It will only make you miserable to dwell on it. "
"&gt;  I ask if he is feeling sick or unwell, and wants me to bring soup or something, and he says no.

This is GREAT.  Because the subtext is you are letting him know that the problem is with him, which is correct.

&gt; Fine. I guess we'll do what you want. Again.

This is a red flag.  It confirms that he was intentionally meaning to control and manipulate you into not going to the thing you wanted to go to.

&gt; Disinvite him or not?

I would have a conversation with him along the lines of ""I'm confused.  You said that you weren't feeling like going to the event and you didn't want to be around the crowds.  What's changed?""  His answer will tell you a lot.

You need to call him on his bad behaviour.  If he manages to give you an acceptable answer to the above question, then goes with you and generally acts like a wet blanket, feel free to call him on it.  ""You didn't have to come.  You chose to come.  You said you wanted to come.  Why are you acting like this?  Are you trying to 'punish' me for not doing what you wanted?""

Call him out in a nice way (that will still be harsh for him if he was being manipulative and controlling)."
"He is supposed to be moving, just a few months later. 'Supposed to' being a key phrase there. 

He always agreed to it and supported me looking out of our area because his job allows him to work remote, but I'm increasingly uncertain about his plans. "

"She's cooking *for you*. For. You. She has communicated this. It's not for her.  If she's going through this whole production making it out to be a gift, then it should be what *you* like. Otherwise, at bare minimum, she needs to own up to the fact that she's doing this for herself.

This is like her saying ""I just really like giving blowjobs with lots of teeth"" and you saying ""but that's not how I like to get head. That's not good for me."" And then she cries, and you accept a toothy blowjob. It's absolute nonsense. She can have it one way or the other: either she gets to feel good for giving a kind-hearted gift to you, or she gets to cook the food the way she feels like cooking it. She absolutely does not get both."

"This guy was a young girl's fantasy Prince Charming, and she gave him a bunch of mushy letters.  Blah blah blah.  You, on the other hand, she gave 8-10+ years of being there for you, through thick and thin, her actual life together with you.  

Words are cheap, and ultimately don't matter.  If you want proof of that, read up all the other posts here where people say their partner is / has been so loving and romantic, but is cheating, or is dumping them, or whatever.

She's loved you for 10 years, and continues to do so.  She's proved it, throughout the marriage, she's made you happy.   

And so have you."
"He's allowed to have a ""type"" and it's okay if that type isn't you. You can still be in a loving relationship with someone who doesn't check off every single one of your boxes.

What concerns me is how he talked to you about it. That was downright shitty. He put you down. I think it's really shitty to tell your partner that you find them unattractive, as long as said partner is healthy, taking care of themselves, etc. And it sounds like you're healthier than you were before. If your body is something he can accept, then he needs to STFU; if it's not something he can accept, it's time to move on. If you're happy in your body now, then keep doing you. 

It's especially messed up that you were actually underweight before, but he prefers you that way. You didn't just arbitrarily change your looks, like going from blonde to redhead; you actually did something objectively positive for yourself and are healthier than you were before. 

PS, you sound lovely. What you did for your friend sounds perfect, and struck the perfect balance of comedy and support. You are a peach and I don't think you should change a damn thing about yourself, other than the boyfriend. ;) "
"She went into a long, dark depression. She really believed that she'd given this man everything and there was no hope for her to marry, have children, etc. She thought her life was over.

Then she went back to school, finished her nursing degree (long set aside while she supported her ex), and within a year of working as an RN she started dating a doctor. They got married in less than a year, she adopted his children (he was a widow) and she now lives an amazing life filled with love and happiness.

Her shithead ex is now divorced. "
"&gt;My wife is a homemaker and we do not have children (wife is infertile and she does not want to adopt). Instead, our ""kids"" are two dogs (a husky, and a golden retriever), and one cat. Since it's just my wife and me, we have an apartment near the university. I live close enough to the university so that my wife meets me for lunch on most days.

&gt;My wife's activities include taking extension classes at the university, gardening, attending a sewing circle with her friends, a book club, etc.

&gt;But when I got home with my ideas, my wife, to my surprise, presented me with her own itinerary, which involved me doing pretty much all the chores she usually does while I'm at the lab. She wrote down a plan wherein I'm basically doing all the cooking and cleaning and dog walking and laundry from the very first day of my vacation.

&gt;I ask her what she plans to do while I am doing these chores at home, and she says, ""this is my vacation too!"" And that she needs a break.

This is completely preposterous. If you had young children that your wife took care of full-time (as in not school-aged) then it'd be more understandable. But she's a homemaker with no children. You work 12 hours a day. ""This is my vacation too""? I'm sorry, but no, it sure as shit is not.

Now, you definitely shouldn't say all this to your wife, at least not in the tone I used. You should try to explain to her the extreme difference in your daily workloads. Yeah, she has to do housework, but she's not doing housework for 12 hours a day; she's going out with friends for sewing circles or book clubs or whatever. You on the other hand *are* doing work for the full time you're there, other than meals. You don't spend half your day just hanging out. And on top of that, you're living in an apartment, which should be much easier for her to take care of than a house.

I mean hell, I lived alone for 4 years while working a 40 hour/week job, and I was easily able to take care of household chores."
"I had to reread your title to make sure it said [31M] and not [13M].

That’s tell tale manipulation, as some else said I’d be pinning a yellow flag to that.

Not I don’t want to go so that means you shouldn’t either. Right well I’m going to stamp my feet and screaammmm”"
"Firstly, I would NOT have a second child with him at the moment. Adding more stress and another person will not help the situation.

"I would say have Ellie help you warn Eliza. The ex-wife could be jaded, but an ex-wife and ex-fiancee with the same story and a short timeline of this happening?

You could even be like ""he is coming on fast and strong, taking you to increasingly romantic places. Asking you to be his? Has he mentioned needing to move to another city/country for work yet? Has he asked you to move in in short amount of time? Maybe quit your job or loan him money? Did he tell you I'm the psychotic ex-wife? He told me the same about his ex fiancee and we have a similar story. This man is a con man, and I am only warning you so you do not end up placing your trust in someone who could not only do this once, but twice and possibly 3 times. What asset do you have that you think he could possibly want? Think about it and be honest with yourself.""

Plus, the woman herself coming to the new partner isn't as shady as friends doing it. Especially if both you and Ellie contact her separately with your story. It's worth a shot."
"Bi guy here.

Okay, so, let me tell you a little about my journey (I'll keep it short) so maybe you can see if it matches his.

It's not really a secret that bi men are viewed, in a lot of places, as VERY different from bi women. Bi girls are seen as hot, cool, desired, sometimes as attention seekers, but not really with...disdain. A lot of the time if a guy comes out as bi, he is labels as 'gay, just not ready to admit it'.

It's kind of embarrassing. I take NO shame in my orientation, but only maybe....1 in 5 people that know me knows I am bi. I don't hide it, but I also am not feminine at all, don't go to gay bars, etc.

I have also been in a relationship, committed, for over 5 years with a woman. 

(To be fair, I didn't start sleeping with men until I was with her, and she encouraged me to explore my curiosity. We aren't open, we don't cheat, but we will do group stuff together).

HOWEVER, if she told me right now she never wanted me to be with another guy as long as I was with her, I would agree in a heartbeat. 

Another thing you might want to ask is even if he is bisexual, is he biromantic? As in, can he have feelings for men? I cannot. I've 'loved' men in my life, but no matter how much, it's not romantic or sexual. It's brotherly. I've never had any feelings for any man I've slept with. He might be the same. If so, it's FAAAAAR less likely he's going to feel that he is missing something. 

Bi people often get regarded as cheaters, or honestly, in the same way you are looking at him. Like one gender will never be enough. 

That's....kinda silly if you REALLY think about it. I like athletic girls and bbws. I like blondes and redheads. I like small girls and tall girls. I like quiet girls and outgoing girls. Obviously no girl can be all of that. I'm not going to break up with a short girl to date a tall girl, if the rest of the relationship is going well.

Let me give another example. I LOVE shrimp (stay with me).

My girlfriend, while not deathly allergic, the smallest amount of shrimp, at ALL, basically calls for her entire digestive system to empty at both ends. I've seen it happen when we ordered a plate with chicken and shrimp to split at just eating the parts of the chicken she shrimp touched caused this.

So, I don't eat shrimp. We don't keep any shellfish in the house. I won't even eat it when I am out without her, in case I forget to shower and brush teeth and kiss her by accident (yes, that causes it too)

It's a sacrifice. It's a SMALL one, but one I don't even think about.

He's with you because he wants to be with you, penis or vagina or whatever you've got down there. 

Any questions, feel free to ask."
"&gt;She doesn’t have a problem with any of my other female friends and befriended most of them.

"If you are waiting for you to stop getting ""into petty little tiffs"" you will remain unmarried.

If you need something to compare your relationship to, then you should dump her right now and get a new relationship because short of cheating I don't see how you can ever have something to compare it to.

Yes, you should know by now if you plan to marry her some day. That does not mean your plan cannot ever change. But from what you see now, you should be able to say ""if things continue as they are going I can see us getting married"". You are being wise to wait, things must continue as they are going for quite some time, preferably through at least one life change, for you to actually get married. But what on Earth do you think is going to change to make you realize you want to marry her? You will suddenly have an epiphany? Enough time of not knowing will pass? 

(There's no such thing as the one. There are people we are compatible with and people we are attracted to. The Venn diagram of those 2 groups is all your potential ""the ones"". You can choose whichever one from that group, and then work at it. It's not a bad marriage if you find yourself attracted (not just physically) to sbd else 10 years down the line. You simply realize they are no more suited to you than your partner, they just happen to be in that Venn diagram, too. It's useless leaving your partner for them because you'll just have to start over with all the hard work, and the eventual situation will be the same. The attraction you feel towards them is no bigger than the attraction you felt to your partner when you were only starting out, and this new attraction will mellow with time in the same way.)"

"&gt; Why is she doing this?

She already said what she was thinking, so it's unclear why you're looking for an answer why.  Do you think she's lying when she said:

&gt; She says it’s because I should be present and spending time and having fun

She thinks that she'll be distracting you.  Maybe you disagree that it's necessary but that's what she's thinking according to her words.  If you are absolutely convinced there must be a secret unspoken reason, two possibilities are:

Maybe she doesn't want you to be too clingy?

Maybe she doesn't want to be seen as a burden when you're trying to have fun?"
This is definitely worthy of a breakup. 
"This is a really tough situation, and i'm sorry you have to deal with it. My father tried to prevent me from leaving an ex of mine a few times, but he came around very quickly when i spoke to him about it. Your parents sound a lot more obstinate. Here is a possible approach:

Sit them down. Reiterate that you don't have a place dictating their relationships, but their continual mentions of your ex are seriously affecting your relationship with them - you're very uncomfortable withit and it makes you want to leave when they bring him up. Then you tell them that you are going to provide context, and they need to listen without interrupting if they want to continue having a close relationship with you. Tell them what happened between you and your ex, the toll it took on your mental health, and how horribly betrayed you felt when they took his side and refused to hear your perspective. After you've had the come-to-jesus talk, leave whenever they bring him up, even if it's within the first few minutes of your visit. Tell them why and keep doing it.

Good luck; i hope they can move on and you can forgive themfor betraying your trust like this."
"No, nope, not at all. Well, maybe for the immediate time, no. 

The fact that your wife was talking to her ex about this set up before ever mentioning it to you, the biological dad, is a shitty red flag.


&gt;She then got REALLY offended and accused me of preferring Matt over Jake and that if her ex is good enough to spend time with Jake why isn’t he good enough for Matt? She then said she thought I viewed Jake as a son

This is a HUGE red flag. She's trying to confuse the situation by manipulation and dragging emotion into it. *Her* ex can spend time with *their* child as *they* see fit. If the topic of *your* child comes up, her ex can go kick rocks. You are being a kickass dad who's looking out for your baby's best interests. ___Do NOT cave on it___ Matt will depend on you for guidance, discipline, love, consistency, and parenting as his father. You stick to your guns and trust your gut!


&gt; am the corny loser that’s “technically not even his real dad” (his words).

Whose words were these, Jake's or his dad's? Because an adult has been saying this and Jake, the child, has been listening. Your wife needs to step up and talk to Jake AND the ex to correct this (or is possible she has mentioned this?) ASAP. 

TBH I find it offensive that she hasn't corrected this, considering that this ex (the bio dad) took off, had whatever adventures/mishaps/incarcerations/etc, and contributed zilch financially and emotionally as a parent while you stepped up. That is out-fucking-standing IMO and the mark of a wonderful man! 

Matt is 4 years old and doesn't understand anything beyond his brother going away for a couple days and then coming home with stuffed animals or a new toy. He's jealous for about 25 minutes and then probably goes back to coloring or pushing his Tonka trucks around the living room floor. 

You should explain to Matt that Jake is going to spend time with his dad and while he's gone, YOU GUYS can go fishing, walk to a park and swing, maybe go see a movie, etc on those alternating weekends. You two carve out your own special time. This will distract him and he'll get to bond a bit better with you. 

Good luck &lt;3"

"Hanging out between class and partying after a test is NOT at the same level as attending someone's birthday. 

These are basically work friends. Their social lives are totally separate, except for the times when they do a few things as a group. 

They are colleagues, not friends. Leave them alone and make friends outside of that group."
"Yeah, that’s probably the worst way of doing it, because you’re making a statement that says you’re right and she’s wrong. 

If it’s after EVERY story, that is going to make her feel attacked. Frankly, most people don’t view story exaggerations as “lies” either.

I doubt your friends care about the record or remember the details next time you tell it.

"You know your father best.

If it was my dad I wouldn’t mention it.

He knows and he doesn’t care, takes a lot of love to look past something that big...be grateful for the time you have left with him..he is your real dad..blood doesn’t matter."
"Yes it's normal, although I don't know how common. My wife's sister read a baby book when pregnant and made her husband read a chapter in it, if not the whole thing, which specifically dealt with this topic. Because dads can take longer to bond, and can feel more detached from the baby because it's not come out of them, if the mom is breastfeeding then the dad can feel a bit superfluous to requirements, they likely go back to work quickly so are around much less, etc. And without that bonding to take the edge off, as it were, all you're left with in the extreme is a screaming potato who's taken your partner away from you!

So in short, try and cut him some slack. Because feeling this way isn't personal, and making it so will just make him defensive and add tension where there's enough already. Try and listen and sympathise - let him explain how he feels, try and get him included as much as possible so he gets the bonding time.

One thought - you say ""she's my whole world"" - where does your husband fit into that then? Is he not part of your world too? Are you still being loving and affectionate towards him? And him you of course! Because yes you've got a new person to look after, but you still need to make time for each other as well. Don't lose yourself in ""mom"" and forget about ""wife"". You say ""my angel"" not ""our angel"", too - make sure he's involved and feels like a dad, a husband, and an equal part of this whole thing. I mean there's a lot more do with being a father than ""acting baby silly"" - what are you doing together, what baby stuff does he do? Bed times, bath times, nappy changes? 


And given he's been open and honest about his feelings, try and see it from his perspective rather than being hurt and taking it as a personal attack. Because these are *his*, very raw, very hard to express feelings. They're not about you, even if you take them that way. "
"&gt;When he does the shopping he buys the cheapest things possible but I like to buy nicer foods and make things from scratch and honestly I'm not willing to compromise on quality.

OP, I think this is the crux of the issue. Given the *amount* of food he requires, it makes sense to him to buy the cheapest items. Because you require less food in amount, you are free to upgrade your quality. I don't think there's any way you can ask him to pitch in on the bill if *you* require that he also buys the expensive items.

Either way, this is definitely a discussion you'll have to have if you ever plan on moving in together.

It sounds like you've sort of fallen into the pattern of feeding him. Make it deliberate. How many times per week are you willing to cook for him? An alternative to always cooking is that he can buy his own groceries to store at your place for nights when you don't feed him. What is your food budget, and given how much he eats, how many times are you willing and able to feed him using the quality of ingredients you want? If that number is really low, are you willing to compromise on quality in order cook for him more often?

If he snacks a lot, have him buy his own (cheap, voluminous) snacks to keep at your place, so that he leaves your own (expensive, small) snacks and food alone.

This doesn't have to be about you *failing* to host him or anything; this is about you wanting your home to be comfortable for him *and* you. You need quality food and to not go broke. He needs large amounts of food, doesn't care about quality, and also not to go broke. Bring this to him as a problem you two can solve *together*.

Edited to add: I noticed you mentioned downthread that cooking means you can make more well-balanced meals, but does your BF need the meals to be as well balanced? You could easily add on some cheap fillers (beans, rice, bread) that you might not eat at all, but will fill out the meal for your BF."

"I know you said you didn't think this was sexual but I think you're wrong and here's why. 

How many times did you see the two brothers engaging in this extremely touchy behavior? How many times did his Dad sleep with them while they napped? With either brother? 

Every scenario you describe involves the mother and both sons. It is  sexual. 

&gt;His brother and his mom were even closer. He would be in his little twin bed napping in just boxer briefs and she would come up in her nightie and spoon him. She would stroke his chest, thighs, back, and arms. He would pull up her shirt to stroke her belly and would rub her body as well. They would nap like this fairly often. He would constantly tell her how much more beautiful she was than any girl his own age

I mean...*come on*. I actually feel really bad for the younger brother because holy hell is he going to have a hard time finding a life partner. She's essentially conditioned her sons to think *she's* the most beautiful woman. That's incredibly unhealthy. 

None of this is normal. You need to speak to him about it -- hell, just show him this thread. "
"So, it sounds like he clueless in about all areas of his life. I feel for you, I’m sure that was disappointing for you not to notice your efforts. Was it really a surprise, though? Has he always been this way, or has it been a gradual decline of him paying attention to you. All you can do is talk to him. Tell him how that makes you feel.

If this is a friend of his, she needs to find another support system other than him. Calling almost every night of the week to have emotional conversations he can't share with his gf is not a good thing. 

It's time for some transparency from him.

Btw walking out of a date to talk to her was a HUGE no no. I'd have asked for the check while he was gone, the date would be over and we would have had it out on the ride home.

A good partner cares about what accomplishments mean to *you,* not to them. She shouldn't need to be interested in the subject/performance because this about *your* achievement, not her interest.

"OP please don't think this can't happen to you. I'm part of a breastfeeding support group, and a bunch I mean pretty much ALL the mom's there have this exact thing happen to them with their husband. And it all started with them not helping during the pregnancy. Please OP do yourself a favor and get out of that relationship, at least temporarily. Let him know you're serious about him changing his way. My husband and I went through something similar, although he was just lazy and having a hard time fighting through it. He always did though. But one day I got tired of him still complaining about ""chores"" and still being lazy that I left. I left him for two weeks. Keep in mind those two weeks I wasn't begging  him to change  or whateber. I put my foot down and told him i had had enough. That was enough time for him to snap out of his little phase and he is a changed man now. 

Once your baby is born, your whole world is going to change. Your life is going to be about that little human you guys created. It's going to be HARD! The nights are going to be HARD. The sleep deprivation and not showering for days or eating a warm meal is going to be HARD. Can you trust your partner to help you then? Can you trust him to be in this 100% with you? Not 50% like the way he treats his ""chores""? "
"&gt;He always says that babies need a woman's touch or something like that.

To be blunt, your husband has a sexist viewpoint on childcare. He's a man and can't possibly be expected to watch a baby by himself for a long period of time, but you're a woman so you should be able to watch the baby for most of the day, cook meals from scratch, get all the house cleaning done and do it to his exact specifications and when he demands it (no letting the laundry sit until you have more free time, can't possibly leave the dishes in the sink for later!) and not be stressed out at all? How is that realistic or fair to you?

Stay at home parents are not servants, maids, or employees. They are partners. While as a stay at home parent you should be doing more of the housework and when possible cooking, it doesn't mean you should be doing everything--or that you should be expected to scrub the floors every day and have your husband always come home to a magazine-clean household, complete with a home-made dinner on the table, without worrying that he'll blow up on you."
"If you were able to connect to him via your contact list, so is anyone else he's connected to in real life -- professional contacts, your families, mutual friends and so on.

It would be one thing if he was just role-playing this ridiculous character online while maintaining an absolute separation between that and anything in his real life, but he isn't. This is completely unacceptable, and you need to tell him that, and how you found it."

"I work in a top tier law firm too. Working 80 hr weeks in an exteremly high pressure environment fucking sucks. I would never push this lifestyle on my husband/siblings/family/future kids because I love them and want them to be happy. I think it's extremely fucked up that he's pushing it on you. And just to warn you, a long career in this specific industry means that money and success are more important to you than basically every facet of your life. Also, it's full of aggressive argumentative people who don't like to be wrong - hope he doesn't fall in that category - I'd really reflect on whether he does..."
"I was fine with all the NC up until ""She has said that if daughter has a problem with wife maybe we need to go NC with her too.""

Leave your wife *now.* My dad married a woman who destroyed our father-daughter relationship when I was around her age (they married at 12, she told him to choose her or me at 15, spent years being horrible to me, etc.).

He chose her. Even though I'm 25 now, and he has spent the past six years trying to make up this to me (longer story, it was really bad, like she would call to have me arrested for trespassing, even though they were custody visits the court demanded), I don't think our relationship will ever be the same. I see him for one visit each year, and it's hard for me to feel like I love him. He's just another adult to me, sort of like one of my mom's business colleagues. 
 
If I ever get married, I won't invite him to my wedding. I don't tell him anything about my day-to-day. He's slowly hoping he can earn it back, but the amount I cried over him as a child makes it not count now. Part of me still hates him."
"Your boyfriend is being manipulative and petulant. Stop reaching out to him. You did nothing to apologize for. He'll either reach out to you when his tantrum is finished or he won't, in which case you've saved yourself the trouble of dumping someone too immature to actually hash out problems. "
"He can't stop you breaking up with him. All you can do now is block him on everything. If he persists, andit crosses the line into harassment, have a chat to the cops.

But if you are saying ""I  *don't know* about us"" and ""I won't be seeing you *for a while*"" -  then that's too vague, that's not a clear break, that leaves a possibility of reconciliation. So you need to say ""I *DO* KNOW AND THE ANSWER IS *NO*, and I will not be seeing you EVER again"".

And ffs inform friends and family so they don't enable him to get hold of you; be clear; this man is going full stalker"
Bingo. I had to double check the ages; this chick is 31 and obsessively texting someone *while they're at work?*
Thank you for pointing out the best man part. Why does he need a date at all? Other than  the paranoid conspiracy theory reasons that are going through everyone's head it seems odd that he we want or need to take anyone. He should be busy with the groom
"He had posters in your shared room of big breasted woman? He sounds like he’s still 18. Pressuring you, for years, to have a medical procedure for an aesthetic he likes when you had to have a reduction for health issues and had major complications? I’d get out. "
"This is your *best* friend?


You're going to have to talk to her about her behavior if this is someone you really want to keep in your life. Even if at some point you break up, she'll just project this same behavior onto your next boyfriend.


Don't let her brush it off as, ""Oh, haha, I was just drunk!"" or pretend she doesn't remember. Not an excuse. Either she knocks the shit off, or she can find a new best friend. God, imagine getting married one day and this girl being part of the wedding party."
Well he might want her but it sounds like she's decent.  I suspect she wont want him. 
"To me it just sounds like he doesnt care about how you feel, wether its if you are sexually satisfied or if what he is saying is making you feel insecure. 
That for me is what I am reading between the lines here. I might be mistaken but to me being in a happy relationship is feeling cared for and that the other person wants to see me happy, and I am not sure its the case here.  "
"And people wonder why the ""break up"" is so common.  If it's a normal problem, they don't usually bother posting here.  They just wait until they're about to explode and then post -- usually for confirmation that the relationship is over."
"Well, honestly, you have a fetish, and likely value your privacy and the strong border between work and personal life. This often causes a “healthy paranoia”.

You sound dominant in nature and likely tend to notice submissive personalities, even when they are fabricated.

He sounds like a goober. I think your reading the lines between the lines here.

Is it possible sexual attraction is causing some confirmation bias here?"
"Thank you. I'm just so shocked and hurt. 

Everyone here has children and I don't mind hearing about them or meeting them, it just brings up raw feelings. I'm worried that he may be upset about this and complain to the owners."

"Right, but also, this...

&gt;He went to a strip club with another girl two nights ago while I was working at home and lied to me about who he was with.

Monogamy and non-monogamy aside, that's dishonest and unfaithful. I suspect even those of us who aren't monogamous would consider this cheating as it's doing something sexual with another person against the will of your spouse."
Just message the gf first and then write him this 😊
"Often times abusive men wait until their gf/wife is pregnant before they start the abuse, basically because now you’re stuck with them.  

I’m not calling him abusive, I’m just drawing a comparison.  Maybe he was waiting until you were pregnant to be....this, and expect a wife who takes care of him while raising the kid.

I’m sorry this is happening. I have no better advice than marriage counseling or if he refuses move in with your parents and stop contributing to the mortgage until he agrees to go to counseling. "
"I would go with the tried and true ""when you do X I feel y"" formula: 

""When you make comments/jokes like this about how much I eat, it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'd really like you to stop doing that."" 

You will probably get hit with defences about how they are only looking out for you, at which point acknowledge it and reject it ""I get that you're trying to help me but what you are doing is actually really *un*helpful, and I need you to stop"". 

And then go back to your first point. It's not up for negotiation.

The important thing here is to keep calm and focus on the outcome you want, not the whys and whats of them as people. "
"What jumped out at me was ""high school sweetheart""... you have to both be in high school for that to be the case!"

Listen, I don't wanna sound mean, but I have some bad news about your thinking ability"
"This.

Psychosis can be very sudden onset. That said, your date was not likely the onset.

Since you have a relationship outside this date, you could talk to the prof or his family. 

I would suggest, as a person who has dealt with other’s paranoia (schizophrenia is in my family), that you don’t ghost. That could add to it. I would just, personally, “had a great time but don’t think it’s gonna work.” If you vanish, and he’s paranoid, he might start hunting for you in fear that the aliens or government have come for you. This could be… distressing for you - it was for me.

My partner works in a psychosis unit as a nurse, and I hear some weird stories, but many people are just not well if lovely humans. This guy definitely needs help, but you’re not responsible for getting it for him. If you *want* to help, reach out to someone closer to him so they can get him serious help."
"I imagine that the wedding invite was addressed to Boyfriend and Girlfriend, not Boyfriend and plus one. It’s not his invite to give away, it’s yours. Even if they do need a final headcount, they don’t need names. Tell him it’s rude to invite someone when he might have to rescind the invitation later, which he will have to do if it turns out your schedule allows you to come."
"&gt;She will let me cook If I ask nicely but I can tell that when she does, she'll quietly, reluctantly agree. If I change my mind and let her cook instead she'll get the biggest smile on her face and give me a HUGE hug and kiss.

"So presumably the kid’s other parent knowingly broke up your family with an affair, and is now like “I bet I can get some cash out of this family using the kid”.

Classy."
"You certainly do kick him out. Now. 

Regardless of the friendship you used to have, he is now manipulating you, controlling you, sexually harassing you and completely diminishing your thoughts and feelings. 

You are very patient, I would have snapped at this point. Sitting next to you for hours on end while you’re having private time is just a complete breach of personal space. 

This living arrangement will never work. You have expressed time and time again, your dislike for his behaviour and he has disrespected every request. "
"If he had really only been using it for friends and business, his reaction, when you initially asked him, would have been to say ""Oh, yeah, I use that for friends and business.  See?  Here's the match I got...it's a business thing.""

He didn't do that; he denied it right out of the gate (lie number 1), then he started layering on the falsehoods....

So.  You have a guy who 1) installed an app for dating, 2) lied about it to your face when you asked, 3) lied about it *again* when you proved that his first lie was wrong...

What more do you think you will learn about him if you ""give things more time""?"
"This is really the most important point. That guy could have been dying alone and OP's fucking family is blaming him for calling the police. *He had no other choice.* Time is of the essence when someone's life is potentially in danger.

"He's robbing you of your ADHD meds. That's a criminal offense in the US. 

I'd definitely confront, and make him pay you. "
"&gt; I don't want to have to ask him to be more considerate of how much he's eating. I'd feel stingy asking him to pitch in more money for food.

Food is a really difficult subject to try to de-emotionalize, but I think you really need to try to do that. Take words like ""considerate"" and ""stingy"" and other emotional terms out of it. This is purely about numbers. X dollars' worth of food is being eaten and you only have Y dollars to spend on food per month including what he gives you. Bring out your grocery receipts and add them up if you need to. If you guys are a solid couple you should be able to attack this as ""how can we work out a food budget that works for both of us?"" and not ""stop eating so much, you hog."" 

The fact that you don't live together is not relevant, it is still your food being eaten. If you were going to his place and he were feeding you regularly, it would be perfectly valid for him to bring up the same concerns if they arose. 

If he is able to sit down with you and rationally work out a budget, that's a good sign and a good milestone for you as a couple. If he flips out and demands that you keep feeding him, then that tells you there might be a problem (such as poor communication skills or sense of entitlement) that goes beyond budgeting for food."

Don’t listen to them Op. what’s he’s doing is selfish. He doesn’t care how his actions hurt someone he claims to love. Confront him and if he refuses to come clean tell his GF yourself. "
Why are you even dating him? He sounds like a toxic person. And he’s making you insecure about yourself. You shouldn’t put up with that. You should be with someone who loves you for everything you are. Not constantly nitpick things about you that you can’t change. That sounds like an awful relationship. 
Use that anger to fuel your departure from this unhealthy situation. You’ll be sad and resistant to change later. Let ‘angry you’ protect ‘sad you’.
"I'm really starting to think about a career change. I've been thinking of teaching school. Whether at high school level or at university the pay will not be much different than what I now earn, and at least there's regular time off."
"Your boyfriend might not say it’s sexual because he grew up like this but that’s only because his mother has groomed him to accept this strange behaviour as normal. The fact that he has had multiple misunderstandings regarding physical boundaries in the past just goes to show how his upbringing has affected his perception of normal.
Even if we ignore their regular weirdness, the way she butted in when you were having your own moment to join in on the cuddling seems oddly territorial ... or at least disrespectful of your own physical boundaries as someone who’s not her child. "
"It's quite common for women and girls on the spectrum to not act in ways that people think of as typically autistic, because of differences in socialisation.  Girls get taught that it's their job to manage the emotions of people around them, and so autistic girls often put a lot more effort into seeming neurotypical - arguably this is one of the reasons they often end up undiagnosed until much later in life."
"You are 33 and it has been 5 years. He is aware of age affecting fertility rate. He knows exactly what he is doing. 

He does not plan to marry you. I am sorry."
He sounds more like 13 than 31. Why does he need you to stay home and clean the baseboards just because he doesn't want to go on this trip? He's perfectly able to decline the invitation if he doesn't want to go.
I feel like it's much less likely spiteful revenge and much more likely that both the parents and the ex are holding onto hopes of the relationship coming back together. Both probably think that maintaining their relationship keeps the door open

"Okay, you litteraly had a ""Mom and Dad"" savings account, he needs to back off.

* Insurances (I pay them annually to save on the monthly fees, but save weekly to have the amount ready)

* Emergency.

Whatever I take out of my Gift/gaming is my business and if my GF makes a scene about how many games I buy, well that the money i saved for that EXACT purpose.

did your BF think you'd end up throwing it on the house, or to him? Or to whatever fantasy project he had in mind but didn't tell you about?"
It’s funny because it sounds to me like there’s no way that girl would get romantically involved with him cause she seems decent with a proper head on her shoulders. Your boyfriend is a loser. Cut him loose and be happy you dodged a bullet.
"I'm sorry OP. I had a feeling after reading your original post that this was the case. 

My sister had almost exactly the same experience. She was with a guy forever, they had plans to get married, they set a timeline -- and then he flaked. And then he flaked again. When she asked him wtf, he spun the same story about ""not being ready"" yet. And admitted that he had no idea when he'd be ready.

They broke up a few months later, and my sister was a decade older than you are, OP. He almost immediately met someone and married her within six months.

I'm glad you're getting out now, still with plenty of years to find the right person.
"
Those are two pretty manipulative replies.
"You're right. I DO know too much. Since I moved back to be closer to them, my mother has used me increasingly as a confidante, and I've let it happen because I feel her loneliness and feel sad that she doesn't have any other friends. 

But what you said really resonates: this is a CHOICE she's made, that he's made, that they've made."
"Shit talking someone who gave him a compliment makes it pretty obvious that he’s into her and is just overcompensating. 

The comment about “what type of girl she is” is kind of sexist, and so is using terminology like “smash”. It’s just kind of offputting and gross to me. This along with not being able to take a compliment without thinking about sex.. leads me to believe that he’s got a lot of growing up to do. 

Edit: I think a lot of people are pinning this on other woman. I just want to point out that literally just last week, I told my friend’s husband enthusiastically that he looked good without a beard. I said this in front of my  friend and my bf. Nobody batted and eye, had comments about what type of woman I was, talked about sex with me, or went through my Instagram as a result. Everybody just said “right?” and forgot about it instantly. "
I would bail. You can't fix a momma's boy. He will never be able to have a healthy relationship with a woman.
"Answering the door after the first knock, in a rushed tone: ""Hi Marsha, sorry I'm in the middle of something and can't chat but hey I hope you have an awesome day!"" And begin closing the door before you even finish. If she tries to stop you, ask what you're doing, ""Aww, Sorry! Don't mean to be rude but I need to go now, bye bye!"".

Answering the door after an innapropriate amount of knocking: ""Marsha, you've been knocking on my door for 10 minutes while I've been trying to sleep. If I don't answer right away, I really need you to assume im not available ok? My dog barking makes it really hard on me.""

Catches you when you're leaving? Don't turn your body to face her, don't stop walking, do not stop moving in the direction of the door. Be the one to speak first if you can: ""Hi Marsha, what a day huh! You take care and stay out of trouble, bye!"" Tries to stop you? ""Sorry I'm on my way out the door, can't hang around, but take care!""

Catches you on the way in? Again, body language, don't turn to face her, don't stop going towards your door. ""Marsha hi, i'm exhausted, been a crazy day so I'm gonna go sit in the dark until I feel human again. See ya!"" Tries to stop you? ""I would love to chat but my social fuel is totally drained right now. Tanks for thinking of me! Byyeee""

This is what I did with my landlord. Old, nice, and waaaaaay too much time on his hands for story-telling. It helped me to not feel rude, but also didn't really have me lying. Kept it light too so he didn't feel like I hated him. However, it will take time to train her to just accept a hand wave and a friendly greeting. The direct approach is much faster:

""Marsha I appreciate how kind you've been and I really love having a neighbor I can depend on, but I'm actually very introverted. I need my quiet time, and thinking I might have to socialize with someone every day at any moment once I get home makes me very anxious. Please dont think i dislike you in saying this, but I do need a little space."" And if you're up for it: ""Maybe we could start having a weekly tea date?""

I'm a people pleaser too, so i understand not wanting to hurt feelings. But if you can, it's better to be direct. In my experience, if you're not, you WILL be when something makes you snap... and at that point, you may not be able to articulate the right tone or stop from being cruel. Good luck!!"
"&gt;I want t make sure that we are representing the truth as close as possibles that’s the only thing I’m able to remember.

Her crying seems to be the biggest issue here. It's just not normal to be unable to take *any* constructive feedback. You made very obvious attempts to help the situation change and she's not only dismissing you but selfishly only gets her way. This is almost obsessive on her part.
"My MIL wanted me to call her mom. I (politely) told her that I already have a mother I live very much and hold dear, and while she too is dear to me, it's not to the same point, and I would not feel comfortable.

"I read your previous post. Your ex-boyfriend is the worst. What a horrible manipulator. I’m so sorry.

I wouldn’t believe him when he says he doesn’t have anything to do with the rumours. Unfortunately, your ex-friends are also horrible and will probably continue to court a popular guy who flatters them.

Keep your real friends close to you and be completely frank with them about how he treated you, if you haven’t already. Take time to compose “your side of the story” into something that’s only a few sentences long and that you can say without crying, and have it ready if you need.

Keep your head high. You’ve done nothing for wrong, and you’re certainly not stupid.

Please ask a school counselor or your parents for access to a therapist. You don’t have to tell them the whole story, just say that your breakup with him was horrible and sank your self-esteem. You need to talk about this with someone and you’ll need the support when you start school again.

Having someone tell you that they lied to you and used you for two years (!!) so that they could have creative insight on your “stupid lifestyle” is some of the most twisted, traumatizing crap I ever heard. And losing most of your friends to false rumours is also really painful. You deserve some extra support to deal with the next couple months.

Edit: Also, his convenient explanation that your whole relationship was just a master plan to gain literary insight is probably total BS. He’s just enjoying the role of the villain mastermind because he’s a 16 year-old who is insecure with a shitty personality.

I’m willing to bet it’s more like, he wanted a popular girlfriend to match with his new popular persona, and you were already around and kind to him so you were easy to court. And he was still salty and jealous about having been unpopular and bullied, so he took it out on you (you did nothing to him, but as his girlfriend you’re an easy target) and wrote a mocking screenplay during your relationship so that he could have the satisfaction of making you feel like dirt later."
"One thing I noticed is you started this serious discussion about something you actually want in your relationship with a joke. You took a joking routine you guys have (playfully demanding attention like a kitten and him not giving it) and used it as a launching pad to say you want more affection. One, that's blindsiding him, his expectation was to joke around a bit and then you got serious. Two, you set him up for failure because his half of the joke is *not being affectionate*, and you suddenly wanted him to change gears and be affectionate. Three, you were expecting immediate changes and holding him hostage (by sitting on his lap) until he gave you what you wanted. That's fine as a joke, but not fine as a method of serious communication. He's right that there was no neutral option and that's *not fair* and *not right*, because he shouldn't have to bow to your desires or tell you outright no, he should have a chance to let your words percolate and come back to you with solutions."
Don't pay for either of it. He sounds manipulative af.

"My heart is warmed reading this. I like that you're both able to be open, honest, and respectful towards each other."
"I’m sorry. Shortly after our first anniversary, my husband and I were laid off within months of each other. We were able to get temp jobs, only to get laid off again. This went on for a year and a half, mostly taking turns being unemployed (it just worked out that way).

For us, we had to sit down and assure each other that we were a team and could do this. You did this in a way by yelling. It may not have been ideal, but I think it came from a place of fear and love and protectiveness of your marriage. Having this conversation again could be reassuring. 

It was also crucial that we set up a division of labor. The person who stayed home was in charge of the home. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.  It really helped ease stress on the person who was working and gave the person at home things to do. 

Encourage him to access his local job center. CareerOneStop can point him in the right direction. They can help put him in touch with resources and employers and maybe job training if needed. 

Finally, make a little time for inexpensive fun if you can swing it. We took a lot of walks, went to early matinees, any free events we could find. 

We credit this time period with how strong our marriage is now. You two have already shown you can do this. You can do it again. 

Edit to add: I know he’s being difficult to reach. Does he have any friends who can come by? Coworkers who were also laid off? Sometimes our husbands can hear their male friends the way they can’t hear us. "
"You're absolutely doing the ""I'm older and know better"" thing.  That's not fair nor respectful to her; she is your wife, not your child.  You should NEVER use your age and experience as a point in a disagreement, which is what you're indirectly doing.  Just because you didn't want a child at her age doesn't mean she is wrong or will regret it.  She is a different person than you and you should trust her.  She is old enough to think through and make her own decisions.  "
The expression “don’t swim oceans for people who wont step over a puddle for you” has never been more apt.
"Ok, you sound like you're in a very dangerous situation. I think it would be best to go straight to the police and include that he threatened you (because it sounds like he did). Stay with a close friend or some family for a few weeks or ask someone you trust to stay with you. Also, loose that guy's number and go to a different bar from now on. He's not a good person to be around in any capacity. "
Go to the gym with Zack. Dump your girlfriend. 
"OK, Jimmy sounds like a completely great person, obviously. And your parents have reached out first to try to apologize, but as everyone else says, it sounds like maybe they didn't care until your grandparents cut them off. I think that you and he need to explore this REALLY CAREFULLY and not involve your kids whatsoever until you're both *absolutely sure* that your parents have changed their ways."
"I don’t know man, that whole “forbidden to talk about it again” can bring resentment. My husband and I have had communication issues in the past. We learned in therapy that this type of rule can be harmful. Yes, stand your ground and remind her your opinion has not changed. But the “we will not discuss again” thing can really do damage when just reassurance is needed. "
"A girl I use to be friends with use to do things like this. When I dropped her as a friend she was still talking to, and good friends with the parents of 2 of her Ex's.

Her reason was three-fold.

1. A way to keep tabs on her Ex
2. Leaves the door open for them to get together again in the future (in her mind, I told her it was f-ing creepy)
3. Make the parents love her, so they will hate any other girl her Ex's would bring home after her.

What do your siblings think of this? Honestly if my parents did this to me or my siblings, we would ban together and probably cut contact down with our parents quite a bit. They are absolutely allowed to be friends with who ever they want. You are also allowed to let that affect your relationship with them, and pull back from them. My parents also tried to have a unhealthy hold on my romantic life, I moved away form them and cut contact for 2 years. They finally came around when they saw I was serious and that they would miss out on my life, and future marriage I may have, and any children I may have  in the future."
"&gt; It's just the order of birth and older siblings always pass their stuff to you as you all get older

You nailed it right there. As the youngest of 7 everything was already used for me and I didn't mind.  If the car isn't good enough what else will the BF find lacking from your family as time goes on?  If you like your family and your family likes you, then it's easy to see who doesn't belong.  Does your BF have a car or does he plan on driving yours.  Just curious."
"OP, this is what my fiancé and I had to do when a new neighbor we had moved in and treated his apartment like a band practice space starting at 7 am. full scale with drums, brass instruments, etc. It was like waking up in the middle of a rock concert every morning! We had to call again and again and again until they FINALLY got it. For the longest time the response from management was “they can buy rugs and put them on the walls, and they told us they did so it’s not loud.  They assured us the neighbors can’t hear them play” and refused to even stand outside on the street to hear the chaos. We have VERY thin walls so we just kept calling and FINALLY they went out there and were horrified. Haven’t heard a peep since the second warning. Sometimes you gotta make  noise to management to get it taken care of. "
"OP, I'm honestly kind of afraid that you're experiencing some kind of mental breakdown or depressive episode, that's how wild and illogical this is - that you're considering throwing away the woman who has given you her life and love for a decade because she wrote a love letter to an ex while she was dating him, before she even knew you... it's... it just makes me really, really concerned for you. The conclusions that you're drawing have NO BASIS in reality, please understand this.

You're indulging in some serious catastrophic thinking and/or a temptation to outright sabotage your life over NOTHING. Is this something that has happened to you before? Because I've had experiences similar where I felt similarly trapped and desperate over what was - in hindsight, with healthier perspective - not even remotely world-ending, and it was because I was in a very, very bad place. I am afraid that the same thing is happening here.

I'm honestly concerned for you. This reaction is not normal. Do you have access to any sort of therapy via your service? Please go talk to a professional, if possible BEFORE you allow yourself to self-sabotage what sounds like a very good thing with your wife."
"Your husband is a blob person. We see them a lot on this sub. They are people who get set up with a partner who shoulders almost all the responsibility for everything in the relationship and the blob person just coasts along, feeding off the other person's energy.

Blob people don't do any of the work of becoming an adult. They don't learn to get in touch with their emotions if they are bad at that, they don't learn to be demonstrative caring partners if they are bad at that. They don't learn house work, or being present, or how to argue in a healthy way.

They just lock down a self-sacrificing partner who is willing to do **everything** and then they just blob along, being shitty and useless.

And here's the deal - your husband was never motivated by you or your love or your sacrifice to become a better person. He never thought there was any point in not being a withdrawn, withholding loser. He probably could change, but would have to WANT to and it would require lots of hard work in extensive therapy.

Do you want to stick around for that? Do you want to waste another ten years waiting to see if he maybe, kinda, sorts decides to learn not to be a blob?"
"I was with someone for 6 years who said he wanted to get married ""eventually"". I still can't believe I stayed with him 2 more years before I ended it."
"Also, calling the cops could have saved his life.   We have no idea what state she left him in, he could have easily been lying by the side of the road slowly dying.  OP could have saved his life"
"Agree. I'm having a hard time feeling sympathy for Op here. Someone who would have their own mother miss a mortgage payment so he can get a fancy new TV is not a good person. OP saw a man who would happily and selfishly have his mother go in debt so her adult son could buy new toys and decided that ""yeah this is the guy I am going to marry and have kids with"". "
"This is above this subreddit's paygrade.  He need to talk with his doctor and/or a mental health specialist, ASAP.  That should be non-negotiable.  "
"You forgot “But really I’m soooo mature for my age and this is DIFFERENT you guys and he’s such a great guy except for this monumentally huge character flaw”, where “great” = the bare minimum"
"It’s not just undercooked meat, it’s also unwashed fruit and veggies. Maybe you went to a cafe and they put a slice of unwashed lemon in her water or gave her unwashed salad leaves. It could have been anything similar to that."
"&gt;He said that I'm using the pregnancy as an excuse to be lazy

**Hahahaha!**

*Sorry*.

What?!

Growing a baby inside you 24/7 *is* a chore.

You're an incubator slave to him, at this point, OP. You can ask your doctor to tell him how heavy a pregnancy is on a woman, but chances are he'll think your doctor is just taking your side, or worse, is also a woman and doesn't know. He knows this baby anchors you to him so he can get away with being a jerk. Don't let him."
"&gt; He tried to throw a tied up store-plastic bag of garbage at me up the stairs, then when I threw a shoe and said “Fuck you!” he raced up the stairs with the bag.

&gt; I had no expression and didn’t move while I asked him, “What are you gonna do, huh?” He held up the bag and grabbed my shoulder area, saying “I’m gonna make you eat garbage.” But I wasn’t insitgating, I was calm and he stormed out, saying, “Find your own way to the festival.”

Uh, this is really unhealthy and disturbing. Healthy relationships don't turn out like this, and both of you were being abusive. I think you should really think and reflect on if this is a relationship you want."
"Girl... this man is a misogynistic POS. 

Nobody should ever control your birth control but you. If you don’t want birth control for any reason, you don’t need to get it. ESPECIALLY because some dude wants to bareback. If you want birth control and your partner is preventing it, also a huge problem. This is something you should have full autonomy with, just like going to the bathroom. It’s your body. That triggered me so hard. 

As for all of the sex stuff, there’s got to be more to it than this. Possibilities include porn addiction, cheating, gay, asexual, wants to control you. His excuses don’t make sense, though. 

No sex for you but lots of stuff for him is just... what’s the word? Oh. Abuse. This young man is a dumpster fire. 

If I were you, even outside of the birth control issue, I wouldn’t stick around. You are young. Ain’t nobody got time to date someone who makes you feel like your sexuality is incorrect! Also I wouldn’t be sticking around for no sex... 

3 months? Lolllll bye boy "
Simply tell them no. We all get a life to live they lived theirs but you aren’t going to fix the mistakes they made. You made the right ones without them and want to enjoy your life. You love them but you will not support them when you are successful. It’s not your responsibility nor should the expect it to be. 
"It doesn’t sound like you or F are doing anything wrong. Unfortunately, a lot of people would be insecure in your girlfriend’s position. There’s another woman, that knows you well, that has a deep connection to you, that is ingrained in your family, and that a girlfriend of yours could see as competition for not just your approval, but your families. I can see why she’d be freaked out by seeing the level of involvement F has with you and with your family. I’d say insecurity, but it could also be a dealbreaker for her. "
Somehow I get the feeling OP's girlfriend is just like her brother. 
"My goodness woman, stand up not only for your neighbor but yourself also. Your a full grown woman, you do not need permission. Your woman's intuition is on high alert for a reason. 

Ignore your do nothing boyfriend, go over to your neighbors house and knock on the door. It's about time for you to introduce yourself anyway. If there is no answer, try another time and keep it up until you connect.

Give her the scenario, the writtien info and offers of help. Then it's on her shoulders. If she knows what's up, maybe ask her to intervene as the noise is interrupting your evening.

If your boyfriend doesn't like it, tell him to stick it up his arse."
"How to gracefully extract yourself?

You stop texting him and move on. Be polite, but uninvolved, when you see him at work.

If he asks you what is wrong you can respond with, ""It wasn't very kind of you to text me intimately when you're in a relationship already. I'm not side chick material. Let's keep our interactions strictly professional.""

Then stick to it."
"I knew a guy who told me he went backstage at a Pearl Jam concert and met them and went on their your bus. I knew he was a pathological liar so I kept pressing for evidence. He said he had a picture of him and Eddie Vedder. He brought a photo to school a week later which was obviously taken at maybe a Hard Rock Cafe of a framed platinum Ten record and told me it was on the wall of their your bus.

Oh and his bed also glowed in the dark."
"He took part in a for ransom plot with his roommate to kidnap their other roommate. It went terribly wrong and they ended up murdering  him. My ex even eulogized him before the police narrowed him down as a suspect.
It’s a long story but ultimately ended with my ex in jail because he literally could not keep his mouth shut."
"Hijacking to quote OP from a comment elsewhere in the thread:

&gt;She did tell me that she dumped him for being too needy. He would call her at work to the point of her getting into trouble.

OP, man, take a breath. You're sabotaging yourself here. You're loved, you're lovable, you weren't betrayed."
He still wants to take you out he just chickened out on asking.  You're going to have to ask if you want it.
Even if that wasn't an issue... asking someone to put something significant and important to them off for 7 years would be really hard.
There is also the chance she's being catfished
"That's not unreasonable at all, 2 1/2 years is a long time to have not met parents.

It could be that he is embarrassed of his parents, not you. Does he have a close relationship with them?"
"Have you actually told your father what happened when Billy found out you had a new boyfriend? If you kept that key detail to yourself then he has no understanding of the situation from your eyes, which is what you want."
Mate you need to get a lid on drinking. If you're an angry drunk then you need to be extremely moderate. Think about what you need to do to self improve before you enter another relationship. Good luck 
"&gt; ' I knew this would happen but I cant stop it '

This is pretty typical cheater talk. You see, cheaters don't actually do anything, things *just happen* to them.

She didn't intentionally find another guy, didn't intentionally flirt with him, didn't go somewhere alone with him, didn't kiss him, didn't undress, didn't fuck, didn't lie. She did none of these things. They *just happened.* It's not her fault. No one knows for sure why these things happen to people like her. But give her a minute and she can probably figure out why it's all your fault."
"Is wanting him to prioritize you over his kid selfish and unfair? Yes. Was it a bad idea for you to break up with him over that? Absolutely not. I would say your decision to end things with him was really smart and mature. Your lifestyles just don’t match up and you would be disappointed in him and the relationship if you hadn’t. I don’t know what to tell you about your friends, but they are wrong to think it was wrong of you to end a relationship with someone your lifestyle doesn’t match up with. "
"You had a traumatic event.

You need to speak to a therapist to help you heal mentally. 

The bad guy getting punished doesn't magically make the trauma go away.

If you were shot during a robbery, you would have to go to a hospital for medical care, even if the perpetrator was apprehended immediately and your possessions were handed back to you intact.

You were sexually assaulted at the party. You need to seek therapeutic care to get the bullet removed before the infection gets any worse."
"I have a sneaking suspicion the ex would vanish the instant he's required to have some responsibilities instead of just being around for fun stuff. That extends to both doing 'unfun' things with the kids and paying back child support.

OP mentioned elsewhere his wife was lenient and didn't enforce the ex repaying the 6 years he missed, but it's still money she's owed and he's not exactly tripping over himself to make things right. I could be wrong and he could be willing to pay if asked, but I can't help but question why **he's** not the one offering to repay it if he's truly changed for the better. This really smells like he wanted to see his kid but doesn't want to put in actual parenting work, and this 'ex gets to be 100% fun dad, OP gets to be responsible dad' arrangement suits him perfectly.

I might be jaded from seeing how these deadbeats operate irl(including brief phases where they're totally interested in seeing their kid until it stops being all fun all the time), though."
"If you don't feel safe with him around, you should absolutely ban him from the house. The house is your jurisdiction, not your daughter's. You can't protect your daughter from the consequences of her actions, but you can protect yourself and provide a safe place for her. Eventually she's going to need you, but now you have to let her realize that herself."
"He's 26, not 16. Have an adult conversation with him.

 He's either oblivious or malicious. Stop enabling. "
"FYI, it doesn’t matter what time it is. You can escalate to the police if you feel threatened or if the music is too loud for normal hearing."
"I wouldn't bother with ultimatums because his feelings are quite clear. Giving an ultimatum would just create unnecessary hostility and stress, or, if he starts manipulate you by stalling it would just waste your time. Just tell him it's not working and it's time to break it off, thank you for your time and goodbye. "
"I would write down a list of unfinished projects and say ""I need you to pick one of these to finish this weekend.

And every time she brings up a new project, show her the list and say ""I think you should finish one of these instead.""

As for getting in trouble... I wouldn't put up with that.  ""If it wasn't sitting here unfinished, I wouldn't have started working on it.  You had your chance to do it yourself."""
"Even if she were, so what? When she’s ill, she’s ill! My husband fell ill with pneumonia and I was worried sick myself. All he wanted was chicken noodle soup and that’s what he got. It’s not like this is a minor cold, pneumonia is actual fluid in your lungs. When the person you love as your life partner is not feeling well, you jolly well step up. "
This is what happens when someone who doesn’t want a kid has a kid for their partner’s benefit.
"Your parents don't let you run your own finances...at 23 and 26?

A good brother stays out of it, is emotionally supportive to his brother, and IMMEDIATELY takes control of his own finances and encourages his brother to do so as well."
He's showing you who he is... someone you can't rely on.
"She probably didn't realize how much of an idiot he was before.

Unfortunately, many people seem to be perfectly reasonable until you're in a 'trapped' situation. (You moved with them for work, you're pregnant, you're injured and wholly dependent upon them, Etc)"
"Yeah this part is nuts. He needs to serve as a role model and guide for his children, teach them things they need to know. Thats what fathers are for. "
the only crazy part is staying with him.  He’s trash and so are his friends.  
"I am not commenting on anyone else's advice. But it should be pointed out that you are just starting this relationship and there are some HUGE issues already.    This guy would have to pretty much change his entire lifestyle to address these problems.  And that's if he even wants to.  Say he does, how long do you expect it to take?  Do you want to ride that out? Yes, he could do all of this to save the relationship, but those are some really high expectations.  

I'm not trying to be negative, but these are all things you need to consider.  These aren't small issues you have with him. They range from lifestyle choices to motivational issues.

Edit: Also, wanting to someone to be healthy and have a job is not trying to 'change them' .  They should want to help themselves, and he should be doing that.  You can only do so much to help someone, they also have to want to help themself ."
"My Dad was seriously the world's best storyteller. Not only were the stories themselves entertaining, but his tellings and retellings became things of legend.

We all knew that at least part of his stories could have easily been embellished over the years, but nobody was terribly worried about whether or not the details actually occurred exactly the way he portrayed them.

This was a stark contrast to when my dad's brothers flew halfway across the country for my dad's funeral, 2 years ago. One of his brothers started to tell one of the stories that I had heard told SO many times over the years, and I have no idea how, but my uncle made one of my favorite stories (about some illegal, redneck hijynks from the late 60's) more boring than watching paint dry. 

If your wife's storytelling isn't actually causing harm to anyone, I'd stop correcting her. She is telling a story for entertainment value, continually calling her out only serves to make you seem rigid. Not to mention, anyone who has known your wife will likely know to take her stories with a grain of salt, anyway."
Maybe she’s not in a rush to get married. Just because she wants to know if OP sees a future with her doesn’t mean she’s ready so settle down and get married tomorrow. 
"Agreed. 

I think he was trying to protect OP when she was younger so she wouldn't feel unwanted by her bio-dad. I've seen this happen a lot with adopted kids - letting them know when they're older and have more maturity to process it. 

Your dad was probably mad that someone would insinuate you are less part of the family due to genetics, and that he loves you as his own "
"Does he have an issue with the other nicknames or just yours? Is it a ""you guys are so immature"" or is it ""the sexual nature of this nickname bothers me."" If the second, your bf just needs to realize your sexuality doesn't belong to him, and as long as you're not uncomfortable with the nature of the nickname, he doesn't have a leg to stand on. If the first, that's his problem for dating someone seven years his junior. "
"She is selfish, and not a team player. You are married to an adult spoiled child. Sorry not sorry. 

She is unwilling to sacrifice even a FRACTION of what you she expects from you. The cherry on top: she suggested you give up your own car. And take a train. To make money. For her, and her only, to spend. 

The fact that she thinks daycare is a necessity when she has the privilege of being a SAHM doesn't say anything good about her character either. So many working mothers dream of being in her position - to spend MORE time with their children! But she is literally expecting you to pay so she can spend LESS with yours! 

If she were 22, I'd chalk it up to simple immaturity, and give her more of the benefit of the doubt. But 32?!? Either you need to SERIOUSLY draw some boundaries with this woman, accept being a doormat, or GTFO. She's not going to change."
"This. 

OP, you need to make spreadsheets of both of your spendings and present them to your wife. Perhaps seeing her high spending on paper will open her eyes to how frivolous she is. 

She really needs to go to the spa so often due to stress? Do regular yoga sessions not help her de-stress enough? Does having girl outings several times a week not give her enough time to de-stress? Somethings gotta give on her end. 

Perhaps say “I will be putting x amount of my income in a savings account every month. This will leave you with x amount of spending money. You will have to give up something, but I will leave that entirely up to you.” This way you aren’t entirely forcing her choose between yoga or spa days or a grocery delivery service, that choice would be hers. Make sure to point out that putting away money on a monthly basis will force you to make sacrifices as well so she is less inclined to feel like this is a direct attack on her own spending. "
"Look, you shouldn't be ""afraid"" to go online. 

Your girlfriend needs to grow up and you need to lay down the law here, or boot her to the curb permanently. 

This is no way to lead your life, man. "
"Just adding that, baby aside, OP ... this relationship is so not stable or healthy. You're seeing a relationship counselor, having a baby, and moving in with someone you have already been on-and-off with... after only 6 months. That's a lifetime of drama in 6 months.  

The Beatles lied, OP. Love is not all you need."
"""Hey do you remember that conersation we had three months ago when you off-handedly said it would be fun to go to xyz together?""

""Wait what? No.""

A bunch of conversations I had when I was OP's age"
"Why the hell are you still dating this pig? Why are you following his orders? 

This dude cheated on you for **two years** and gave you an STD. Have some self-respect and dump him!"
"That's the thing about Autism, it's never cookie cutter. Woman with Autism tend to be very socialy adapted, especially if she was never ""diagnosised"" as a kid."
"Holy crap, that is important information.  I would NEVER let someone tell me that I had to go no contact with my child.  I'd be done with that person so fast."
"I’m surprised that people are saying that you shouldn’t pay her back for the flight. You got into an argument and left her *alone* to go out drinking while on an *overseas* vacation when you *knew* that it was something that was inappropriate to do and would upset her?

What other option did she have besides going home early? Tbh, and this is harsh I know, I wouldn’t have wanted to be stuck with you for the remainder of the vacation either. 

Pay her back and let her move on with her life. You have a lot to figure out about yourself."
"/r/relationships doesn't allow links, but you can Google for Shakesville's piece ""The Terrible Bargain We Have Regretfully Struck"" and send it to him. It explains how this form of ""debate"" is actually aggressive and exhausting.

&gt;There are the occasions that men—intellectual men, clever men, engaged men—insist on playing devil's advocate, desirous of a debate on some aspect of feminist theory or reproductive rights or some other subject generally filed under the heading: Women's Issues. These intellectual, clever, engaged men want to endlessly probe my argument for weaknesses, want to wrestle over details, want to argue just for fun—and they wonder, these intellectual, clever, engaged men, why my voice keeps raising and why my face is flushed and why, after an hour of fighting my corner, hot tears burn the corners of my eyes. Why do you have to take this stuff so personally? ask the intellectual, clever, and engaged men, who have never considered that the content of the abstract exercise that's so much fun for them is the stuff of my life.

&gt;There is the perplexity at my fury that my life experience is not considered more relevant than the opinionated pronouncements of men who make a pastime of informal observation, like womanhood is an exotic locale which provides magnificent fodder for the amateur ethnographer. 

I also recommend showing him ""Derailing for Dummies"" (dot com!), particularly the ""Derail Using Education"" chapter:

&gt;**If You Won’t Educate Me How Can I Learn**

&gt;Whilst seemingly simple on the surface, there is some intertwining subtext embedded within this one. First of all, you’re placing responsibility for your education back onto the marginalized person. As they are obviously engaged with these issues, and care about them, they are hopeful that privileged people may one day start listening and taking on board what they have to say. By placing responsibility to educate in their hands, you tug at this yearning. You may even successfully make many question themselves and their selfish expectations that you utilize the hundreds upon hundreds of resources on the subject available to you as a privileged person! 

&gt;After all, anyone who expects you to be able to research a topic by yourself also clearly expects you to be far more of a functioning adult than you’re acting! By insisting you can only learn if they right then and there sacrifice further hours of time going over the same ground they have so often in the past, you may also make them give up and go away altogether, enabling you to win by default. But further, you give the impression that you really want to learn, but they’re holding you back! 

&gt;That’s right, using this tactic you can suggest that full understanding is what you crave – you want to be a better, more connected and compassionate person – but it’s not your fault! Nobody ever gave you the education! And now that someone is here who is so obviously qualified, they’re denying you your privilege given right to have everything you want handed to you on a platter!

"Why did she ever want to go to culinary school if she can’t even be bothered to read books? 

School can only teach you so much, it’s up to you to broaden your knowledge and tastes afterwards. 
Clearly she’s not willing to learn and develop, or face the very obvious fact that her foods inedible.  Hopefully this is just restricted to food in your relationship. 

Why does she like cooking so much? What’s her sentiment behind it? The feeling of pleasing you, living up to her idea of being a good gf/wife? "
"It needs to be more than a day. Arrange a long weekend, if at all possible. Do you have family or friends you could visit? 


The problem with one day is that it’s just a day, and he may very well get through it with no issues and forevermore try to say ‘I’ve done it too, remember? And I got laundry done, taught Baby the letter B, and cooked a full dinner! it’s not that hard!’ All because baby had a good day and the dude wasn’t that stressed about the childcare because it was new and exciting.


What wears on people is the constant, 24-hour demands of being the sole caretaker. He may have a very different perspective on the 3rd day alone when his child is screaming because she has a bad diaper rash, and he couldn’t put her to sleep so she’s overtired, and she won’t eat the food he’s making, and the laundry is piling up.  "
"The best thing that I did for myself after my divorce was not date anyone. I took myself to the movies, got mani-pedis regularly, spent time with my friends and family, got a cute hair cut, spent time at the gym, and started working towards some long term educational goals that had been delayed because life. 

It was tough, though. It was weird to live alone. It was weird to sleep alone. It was weird for a long, long time. Like a solid year. But then, I started sleeping diagonally across my queen size bed, made some new (not mutual) friends, got into a new hobby, started really making a dent in those educational goals and it was a really good feeling. 

I'm not that much older than you \[30\], and I'm telling you, you've got this. It's going to be tough, but it's also not the end of the world. Best of luck to you : )"
"Making her look/feel like an idiot in front if others isn't cool, irrelevant of the situation. If its that big if a deal for you, then discuss it in private with her."
"I know! After a serious accident I had as a kid I was in the hospital for a few weeks and then had to stay home from daycare for another few weeks. My dad lived far away so my step dad took over his ""sick kid leave"" so my mom didn't have to be away from work for that long. I was his family, even after just a year with my mom so he happily took care of me. (the government pay your salary in full in these situations in my country)

OP, you have to find someone that cares about your kids or else they will suffer for it. Get well, and leave him. "
"That's... pretty extreme, OP. Is this the first time he's acted this way? Has he been demanding/petulant before?

...Do you have a job?"
"Honestly, this is the answer, I think.  If she says, ""You don't like my cooking!"" OP needs to be prepared to be honest and say that he in fact does not like her cooking.  And then follow that up by saying that he *could* like her cooking if she followed recipes like in that one class they took.  "

"New Counselor here.

&amp;nbsp;


I was always taught that I can't disclose who my clients are, even if my two clients have acknowledged that they are friends and are seeing the same therapist. From what I gathered, that was a part of the whole confidentiality piece. To let Leah know that you were a contact on her intake would be to confirm that you are in fact her client and seeking counseling. 

&amp;nbsp;


I feel that if this is something that bothers you and you'd like to continue to have the relationship of trust between you and Sally continue, you may want to address it in session. I always encouraged my clients to discuss these things with me so we could practice open and honest communication. I actually had a client who worked at a place I had gone to for brunch and I was quite a bit intoxicated during our interaction. We discussed it during our next session what it was like for them and what would they like to happen if that situation ever happened again. 

&amp;nbsp;


As for Sally telling Leah that she should ask you about some of these things, I'm unsure. I would hope a counselor wouldn't say something flat out like that and that it may have been interpreted the wrong way. Again, my advice would be to speak with your counselor about it. This will be a good, controlled, safe space for you to practice communicating with others when moments of distrust and suspicion arise :) "
"Utterly ridiculous and controlling. He should know better at 31. Go on the trip and enjoy yourself.   

Edit: and please read up about the travel restrictions when going to  Cuba from the USA before making firm plans. They are complicated. "
Going NC with your daughter's mother is not a reasonable request as you have to co-parent with her. Can you compromise by saying you'll only speak to her about parenting issues and not anything else?
"I think this is the best response, either she is fake or he is.

I think going to te supposed wedding is the best bet, because either way she will need support. In the meantime ask her if she has a dress and everything prepared, and if she’s made sure to confirm things herself for said wedding. 

Ask her again if they’ve met or tried to, and if not if he cancelled or what happened.

Ask her who else she invited to the wedding and where you’ll be sitting. 

Maybe ask her to go out and visit the horses and see how she reacts. Ask her if she’s visited them yet. This may give you some insight. Also ask if she’s visited her new house yet or got any furniture lined up and when she’s moving in. 

Ask her when and how she got engaged. Maybe ask her which friend introduced them, and if you can see some of their cute messages as you “love that stuff”. Again may give you more insight.

She could be faking or she could be being catfished, maybe even by the “friend” who introduced them. 

If she is faking it, it could be a few things. Wanting to impress you and needing validation badly or possible mental issues or illness. If mental illness and i had to guess I would say delusions, pathological lying, possible NPD, mania from bipolar or a psychotic episode. 

If she has had any abuse or trauma in her past, it could stem from that and the need to be cared for and validated and feel important, good enough, etc. 

Try figure out what’s going on and be prepared to call in a wellness check and explain what’s going on. "
"I think you can forgive him for being a bonehead on this. He’s taking his lumps with grace and maturity. Hopefully he’s learned a valuable lesson. 

And congratulations on your pregnancy!! I hope you guys have an amazing getaway before the kiddo’s born. My parents still like to joke that I’ve technically been to Hawaii. Make sure you tell your kiddo that they technically lost you twenty bucks on roulette."
"Your mental health is important too.

You need to make urgent plans to move out.  

Their amateur psychiatry is going to end very badly for all of you. They seem unable to accept that she isn't going to *get* better, all she can hope for is a safe managed environment, like a ward.Well, parents do crazy misguided stuff for love. And like many families, yours revolves round the most damaged person. You are being ignored to save her. This is sadly common (*it seems to have evolutionary roots, which I am sure are of no interest to you right now, so I'll STFU on that*). Their view will be that YOU are able to cope for yourself. So there's no point trying to guilt them (*""Your stupid and dangerous idea is driving me out""*). And don't you feel guilty either: she is their responsability not yours. Their sleeping on the sofa is a direct consequence of their own bad choices, not yours. Sure, life dealt them a shitty hand by giving them a schizophrenic kid, but they are making bad choices that make it worse for all of you: them, her, you: everyone would be happier if she were in a facility 


TLDR Get out. "
"Well, you were on point about the backing out.  He texted again before I  replied saying that he just doesn't have the energy to go and he'll see me this weekend ""if I have time for it"".

Obviously, we'll have to have a conversation about this next time we see each other because this type of communication is not good.

For the remainder of your reply:

I don't insist on the things we do.  Like when he showed reluctance, I told him we didn't have to do it.  When he brought it up again on Saturday, he said it sounded like fun and something he wants to try out.

He's definitely an introvert.  I think I am too, but probably a different kind.  I don't mind crowds if I don't have to interact with the other people.  Like, if I go with three or four friends, they act as a ""shield"" and I can easily have a good time because I know my friends and we have things to talk about.  His idea of a fun hobby is to read journal articles at home and then have online discussions with academics about them.

This isn't my first relationship rodeo. I know this stage is when we decide if the things that annoy us are worthy of working through or just end it.  I don't even know how to process this argument right now..."
"As a lesbian here, I feel the need to tell you to ignore the comments that tell you to play along with what they want till you’re 18. Many, many studies suggest that doing so leads to intense cases of depression, anxiety and repression, all of which will cause you more trouble and pain down the line. Hiding who you are and masking your truth isn’t something you need at this point in time. While I’m sure playing along seems easy, at first, you should ask yourself if for the next two years you can live a lie and repress that part of your identity. Can you handle not dating, not being with Julia, constantly having to be on guard? I genuinely don’t ask this to scare you — I ask only because these are questions that upon answering, will point you in the right direction.

My advice to you would be this: Find people you trust and talk to them. You mentioned you have family that would be accepting, and I’d reach out to them and make them aware of the situation. It sucks, but adults listen to other adults. They may be able to advocate on your behalf to your parents. If you aren’t feeling safe in your own home, I’d also suggest 100%, staying in a place you will. Being safe is the priority right now. I’d also talk to Julia and her family so they’re aware of the situation — they may also have some level of insight into what you can do moving forward. If you feel strong enough, safe enough and the like, you can talk to your parents about the future. From the sounds of it, their reactions won’t be good, but it can also help point you towards what to do. If this isn’t something that’s just an automatic reaction they can move past, eventually, but rather deep seated hatred, you need to make plans for the future.

I know its scary. I know it sucks majorly. I know you’re afraid. But you have not done anything wrong. Categorically, I assure you, living your life as comfortable wth your sexuality and proud of it will never be wrong and never can be wrong. Kissing your girl isn’t a crime. Loving your girl isn’t a crime. To quote Lin Manuel Miranda, “Love is love is love is love is love.” I’m rooting for you from my corner of the globe and wishing you all the best. Much love, a fellow wlw xo"

"**I know this is horrible to say, but if my classmates don’t care about their suicidal classmate, how can I trust them to care about their patients?**


Jesus. This is a horrible thing to say. 

You sound creepy and obtuse. Stop inviting these people. They don't care about you, you are NOT FRIENDS WITH THEM. Leave them alone. For the love of god don't create drama with them. 

You need to invest in some sort of therapist that can teach you social cues. 

FYI inviting strangers who never hung out with you to a party to celebrate ""being alive"" is so so so creepy. You have already burned bridges and by wanting to create more drama you are going to NUKE them.

"Based on your edit, is it possible that your able brother feels overshadowed? His twin will always need more help, so he needs to grab attention where he can get it. Even if from an outsider perspective, your parents aren't doing enough for your disabled brother, it's still time/resource consuming. He's a teenager and feeling forced to identify more as his brother's twin than as his own person.


Even with twins who are both typically functioning, there is often going to be a feeling of fighting for individuality. A joint birthday party is a compromise, which might not be ideal for either, even if the twins are similar.


Both are getting birthday parties with friends. Maybe you can talk to your parents about each of them having a special family dinner without the other? One where one brother gets to choose the restaurant and it's all about him, and the other where the other brother gets to choose the restaurant and it's all about him. Celebrating them as two separate people who happen to have the same birthday, not ""we need to celebrate together because they are twins"".


You can also talk to your grandma. Maybe let your parents take each of your brothers out, but save you and your grandma being there for a joint dinner."
"You’re doing the right thing! 

When I was married, I tried so hard to communicate my needs, but my partner would write them off. I started fantasizing about finding a better partner, one who was actually a PARTNER. We had a “straw that broke the camel’s back” situation, and I never looked back. 

Leaving him was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. If I had known how much better life would be without him, I would have left so much sooner! 

Take care of yourself and don’t look back! "

"So look, people are going to come here and tell you this is harmless, and everyone lies on the internet, it's a persona/character, yadda yadda yadda, but IDK y'all, that is a LOT of time and effort put into a ""harmless internet persona"" that *despises* his wife. All I can say is that if I found out my husband was doing this, I would react exactly as you are. 

I guess I would ask him to go to counseling together. I genuinely don't know what else to suggest."
I would be furious. If you are not comfortable the. He should respect your wishes.  Do you know his date?
"I feel like the only person who finds this age gap extremely creepy. I'm 25 and have nothing in common with 19 year olds. We're at different places in our lives, and I would feel manipulative dating someone of that age."
"&gt; Should I be seeking a lawyer today, or should I be giving this some cooldown time to see if she has any interest in reconciliation?

Absolutely 100% seek advice from a lawyer today. That does not mean you are filing for divorce today. Your wife doesn't even need to know about the consultation. You also need to start making a detailed list of the dates and times that you are providing care for your child. 

Worked with family court attorneys with a decade, have had multiple friends get divorced. Consulting with an attorney about your options is NEVER bad advice. Sitting and home twiddling your thumbs ""waiting for reconciliation"" while she gets her ducks in order and then goes on the warpath against you will result in you living in a shit bag motel with weekend visitation while she fucks her new boyfriend in your home on your child support dime.
"
I'm going to be honest but if she's not getting therapy to deal with what you guys went through maybe she isn't a good influence to have around right now. Maybe working on yourself should be a priority before you consider dating anybody.
"This is a thing that comes with age and experience. I'm in my late 20s, I lost my stepdad this year and my friends were equally shitty. Lots of ""sorry for your loss"" posts on my mom's facebook wall (so they knew) but my friends basically pretended I didn't exist for a month.   

My older coworkers showed up for the funeral, asked me how things were going, and let me talk. Of course I wasn't about to cry on their shoulders, but it amazed me how considerate they were. But they had been through this kind of thing many more times, and some of them, many times of their own.  

To anyone who reads this and is in a situation where a friend has lost someone and you don't know how to act, just... reach out to them. You don't need to worry about being helpful (although obviously, help with what you can), just acknowledge it, tell them that you're sorry for their loss, and you're there for them if they want to talk, grab dinner/a beer, etc. Go to the funeral or visitation if you can, even if you didn't know the person who died - you're not there for the dead person, you're there for your friend. DON'T ignore them, even if you think they want space. It's much easier for them to say, ""I don't want to talk about it"" than to reach out to you for help."
Why are you living together.  What do you get out of this relationship?  He must be awesome in bed.
I agree completely. It was always hell yes talking about the one day just not when it got to the can it be soon.
"Omg she sounds like a middle school queen bee, down to the lessons about how “cool” people are supposed to  talk and bringing up her friends as backup. What a loser! 

Anyway OP good luck dating! You were totally normal. I am also clear and direct when I date (“would you like to have sex” as opposed to “would you like to go see my ~CD collection~”) and by and large it works great for me. Avoids misunderstandings and keeps immature people out.
"
Remember just because they are family doesnt mean they are good people and neither are you forced to have any kind of relationship with them whatsoever.
"You're being abused and held hostage. You're not allowed to leave without fear of force.

Do you have parents who will help? You need to get help and GET OUT. Don't be afraid that they won't listen to you and don't tell your boyfriend anything on what you're planning. Don't let him see your reddit.

Whatever family you're living with is either going to have to deal with you leaving and them housing an abusive deadbeat with no money, or them kicking him out. If it's not a lease anyway. Do you trust them? Because if you do and you told them what you wrote in this post... Actually, anyone who cares about you in the slightest would be *very alarmed* to hear this. 

There's a few users in here who are more experienced in these situations and will likely post something soon. Please get help from your loved ones and let them know your situation as soon as possible. "
"I'm a woman and I lost it at the mani/pedis and highlights... Those are luxury items. She's so utterly self-centered and selfish here I can't even. ""Your money is my money, and my money is my money, nothing is yours."" I don't really have any advice besides a financial advisor and maybe think about if she's going to divorce you in the future because it seems like she cares about your money more than you. Like maybe go talk to a lawyer now just to see how you can protect your assets in case she decides to drain your shared accounts once you cut off her spendfest."
I think time is the right strategy. He is impulsive but he also is in a new country and is still adjusting. He is unhappy in his career path maybe he can follow his passion. You seem interested to continue your choice.
"your coworker lacks social skills.. 

not everyone is used to having small children around and they don't know how to act naturally around them and especially taking into account the fact that you've just suffered a miscarriage.. it makes perfect sense. 

don't take it personally! there's absolutely nothing to point out about how you interacted with his daughter! you thought she was sweet and interacted with her the best way you knew how. 

i couldn't imagine what the hell point he was trying to make by saying that really. he sounds dense.

"&gt; His response was ""so i'm sleeping in my car then?""

That's on him for his poor adulting.  Do not bail him out.  He won't learn to be an adult until the people in his life stop enabling him."
"This happened to a friend of mine who was with a guy for over 10 years. They were living together and everything and it just never happened. Every bday, anniversary, holiday and vacation she ended up being disappointed that he didn’t propose. The resentment got to be too much and she broke up with him. She’s now married with kids to someone much more well-suited for her and I found out from mutual friends that her ex never even planned to propose and would make fun of her need to get married behind her back. He was an asshole and we all thought she deserved so much better even before all this came out."
"I imagine she probably had a whole scenario in her head about how he didn't *really* love OP and they never had sex anymore and he was just staying for the kids. Even though he never said anything like that, she probably twisted every comment he ever made to fit her narrative of ""marriage is all but over, I just have to bide my time before he can come be with me.""

Once he announced OP's pregnancy (indicating he was excited about it), that was an undeniable signal that the marriage was not on the rocks like she fantasized, and it upset her."
"&gt; I always felt like I was just a second choice he had to settle with because the girl he actually wanted never showed any interest in him.

You were.  You *are*.

All of his jokes are only ""jokes"" so that if you don't say yes, he can deflect and say he wasn't serious.  But the very *instant* that you showed even a hint that you were OK with it, he'd be all over the idea.

You're his consolation prize."
"Leave because you're done, don't use it as an ultimatum. Wanting him to ""pull something big"" to keep you is such a dysfunctional view of relationships. You'd just be teaching him that he can treat you like shit then ""make up for it"" with a random grand gesture whenever you start getting fed up/threaten to leave him."
Ugh. He just added you to a collection of exes. Don't be friends with this guy. Go no contact.
"I am so with you, but I expected to be in the minority. My husband is a bit of an exaggerator, and I had to learn to let it go. Where as I like to tell stories closer to the truth, but I’m better at self deprecating humor, so I don’t need the interest factor as much. "
"It sounds like he wants to be married someday, but his bride won't be you. After 5 years you already know if you want to be with someone for the long haul. He loves having you as a girlfriend -- dude is very comfortable prolonging this stage of the relationship -- but doesn't want to marry you. 

A soft no is still a ""no"". If he *wanted* to be husband and wife then he would make it happen. *He'd* be suggesting going to city hall, not stalling for more time.

&gt;All I asked is that he ask my parents for my hand in marriage out of respect. **He asked his parents but not mine.**

This is ridiculous bullshit. Such an obvious stall for more time.. Why is he asking his parents? He knows that's a non-binding zero stakes conversation, whereas actually talking to *your* parents establishes intent.. He probably is scared and worries your dad will see straight through him, that he is conflicted and thus not worthy of marrying his daughter.

You should formally end this relationship and start the healing process. In time you'll be able to open your heart to someone who is a better fit. The right guy will be ecstatic to marry you! "
"&gt; It may not be a popular opinion, but unless your family isn't great, I'd stick with family

I think your opinion isn't necessarily unpopular, it's a matter of case by case. Generally, what we see around here are dysfunctional family members, who are putting pressure on the person trying to destroy their relationship. In such cases, it's clear that the advice will be ""protect your relationship,"" since that relationship is, in essence, their new family.

But the reciprocal is true - when harmful behavior is coming from the partner, it makes sense that you decide to choose the side of your family. Essentially, you should move away from the dysfunctional side, assuming that you haven't been able to solve the problem in a healthy way, with conversations and a healthy attitude."
Great gonna call my boss now
You shouldn't have to prime him and invite him to behave like a reasonable person. You're not responsible for managing his emotions. 
Why have you put it off this long? Being older doesn't make you a safer driver. Driving and practicing makes you a safer driver. 
"&gt;I don't really want to ask him about it because there's been a few other things he's been hiding from me that I made him admit, so I don't want to feel like I'm suffocating him.

This makes no sense at all. Like because he's already doing 5 shady things you don't get to ask him about the 6th?"

"This is above our paygrade but you need to get out and get out now. Get your own personal lawyer that has nothing to do with him and if the cops ask questions don't talk to them without said lawyer lest you get screw up and get charged as an accessory or something like that. That lawyer should also be able to handle any civil actions that will almost positively creep up in the future.

And get a different lawyer for the divorce.

Once news gets out this will absolutely suck for you and your children and I'd recommend professional help. Also try to get away. Stay with family or go on a vacation or hell move (though that last one is obviously less realistic)

"Sorry I kinda don’t think what you did was cool? Speaking from experience, I had a cashier ask me out and I politely said I don’t think so. I went back there because the store is close to my house and he (the cashier) brought it up again. Made me so uncomfortable when all I’m trying to do is buy my things and go. "
"You sound kinda crazy rn. 

I used to write love poems to my first boyfriend. Sappy things about how I wanted to have his child and shit. 

To my current SO, and father of my son, I’ve never written a sappy love note or 3 paragraph text... mostly because I’m older and I realized that just because someone texts you they love you doesn’t mean it’s accurate. I wake up to him every morning and kiss him good morning and thank god for letting me share my life with him. I show him I love every day by taking care of the family we’ve created and standing by and supporting him (much like she stood by you while you were deployed). I don’t tell him he’s my true love in a letter, because I show him that when I brush the hair off his forehead after a long day at work. 

Look up love languages. As we grow we learn to express our love differently. Have a conversation with your wife about the type of love expression you need. Don’t assume her feelings. "
"I was in a relationship with a 10-year age difference at your age.

We strung it out for four years but ultimately ended it for similar reasons.

She wanted a kid and I didn't. She was settled in her career and living situation, whereas I wanted to explore and figure things out still.

It's okay to end a relationship because you're at different places in life."
"1. First she shows interest in going, he doesn't want to so the aren't going. 2.Then he decides he does. so now they are going.  3. Then he decides no he doesn't want to go and expects her not to either.  Then gets mad because she is OK with him not going and is gong with friends or alone. 4. Then he decides again he will go and gets pissy when he finds out she has arranged to go with some other people and he says to her  ""Fine. I guess we'll do what you want. Again.""  

That is all about him wanting to make the decisions and expecting her to just going along with what he says.  That's the kinda shit that sneaks up on ya and 5 years later you don't even remember who you use to be. "
"&gt;They are visiting us soon on a 6 mo trip to help us with our baby.

There is no way this is actually a true statement. Do you honestly believe that she will be more helpful than stressful?"
"&gt; Honestly? You both sound far too good for him. She noticed how shit his behavior is, so if it makes you feel any better, she will most likely reject him. And he will have no one.

This is true. If she really is as decent as she came across she probably realised what type of person he is and will stay away because if he is this willing to drop a relationship for someone he met 5 weeks ago, he likely will do the same to her whenever the next attractive girl catches his attention.  

That said. If she is that smart and does reject him, he will likely try to come crawling back to you and under no circumstances should you take that jerk back. "

"If he’s into being rough he needs to clearly discuss that with you BEFORE he does it in bed. Just springing that on someone is refusing their consent. It’s not ok, and it’s a huge and dangerous red flag, I don’t care how mild the action was. He’s testing the waters. He’s not being safe. Honestly, I would not give him another chance. It’s fine to be into BDSM stuff, but this guy is much more likely to be dangerous than fun and I wouldn’t risk it if I were you. If you like the idea of BDSM find a partner who knows and cares what they are doing. "
Thank you. This is how I feel too. I appreciate your response.
"The more you pay for him, the more he’ll take advantage and the longer he’ll continue to be manipulative and irresponsible. Say no now and stop the problem in its tracks. Like top comment said, if he blows up and blames you, you know exactly what kind of man you should be walking away from. "
"I came here to say that, just because a relationship ends, doesn't have to mean the secondary relationships have to. But this is something else. They seem to be *siding* with him. Are you sure you told your side of the story adequately?"
"It sounds like it was an indirect way of leaving an opening for you to connect on non-business work, and because it was indirect and left an opening _for you_ to reach out to him I do not see it as unethical but a reasonable, cautious way to have handled it without putting pressure on you or associating that conversation with his work for you at all seeing that it didn't come up until your business dealings were concluded. 

I don't think it is a horrible idea if you like him as a person. If you are interested, proceed with caution. As long as he doesn't prefer you in the state of being desperate, hapless and miserable as you were when he was comforting you, you might just be a good fit. "
"I mean, I'm more like your wife in this situation (don't think to vacuum unless there's a visible reason, skip meals a lot and don't do a lot of meal planning/cooking, generally higher threshold for dust and whatnot) but it sounds like she's just leaving shit all over the place? I mean, how hard is it to not do that? I put extra trash bins in all rooms of the house, especially places where I hang out and accumulate stuff (my desk, the sofa, kitchen table). I will occasionally make very large quantities of soup or something that I freeze in individual portions and then reheat when I don't want to think about food. I also used to be guilty of leaving clothes on the floor and now I have an extra collapsible hamper in the closet and I throw my ""not brand new clean but not dirty yet"" stuff in there and fish it out like a feral raccoon in the morning when I'm getting ready because my company has a very lax dress code and nobody gives a shit if I wear jeans that weren't folded in a drawer. I also have a whole bunch of stackable baskets with handles that I keep all over the place so when I want to clear up clutter (not trash, stuff like books, video games, papers, notebooks, pens, etc) I just dump it all into a couple baskets and stack them up in a closet somewhere.

These are all pretty simple ""lazy-person"" workarounds that I've implemented to be more considerate when living with someone with a higher standard of cleanliness."
"Ugh, I had a bf like that once. He would buy the shittiest food and I'd make myself really decent quality food and keep leftovers but they'd always be gone before the end of the day. I'd demand him to pay for more food and he'd just buy more cheap shit saying he didn't mind and that I shouldn't mind either. Really disrespectful imo. "
"&gt; she's emailed a one of my parents employees about it as well, and told this person that I am on the pill

Uh, what? This is super fucked up. She told your parents' employee you're on the pill? Why does she have any contact with this employee in the first place let alone telling them your personal information...?

Get in touch with her company and file a complaint. Make it very, very clear that you will be pursuing this further because this is a serious matter.

Also, are your parents not concerned that she is discussing completely private shit that is 100% not her business with other people...?"
That is incredibly inappropriate. Your friend wouldn't be lying to you about your sister unless she had something to hide. I would end the friendship over this and let your mom decide on a course of action.

Well, in a perfect world none of us would have kids till we retire on a massive pension. But that's not how life works, is it? The bugger about biology is that you need to have kids before you are stable financially and career-wise. If he doesn't understand the time linitations of female  human reproductive biology he's being willfully ignorant. And if he doesn't realise that, or accept that a balance has to be struck betwee finances and biology, then he's not as rational as he believes he is. And you can't afford to sit around waiting for that to change.

Furthermore, absolutely none of his ""reasons"" prevent him *marrying* you. That's just sheer avoidance. If it was just that, I'd have said go for couples counselling to work out why you want it and why he doesnt, what are the prejudices and expectations of  marriage that drive you but prevent him from marrying.

In short, he's fixated on his business to the exclusion of actually living a life. His business development is more important to him than kids are, than YOU are. Well then, you have utterly  opposed goals, so this is cant ever work long term.

tldr this is over. What a tragic and avoidable waste. What an idiot he is."
"&gt;I've stopped hanging out with Sam except for maybe once a month because my boyfriend makes me feel guilty/weird about it. 

Yeah, bingo. His shitty immature manipulation paid off. What lesson do you think he's learned from this? Your boyfriend is clearly the kind of dude who can't handle you having a male BFF. That in and of itself isn't weird. He controlling and manipulative behavior is the worrying part."
"I don't think the age is the issue here - it's the creepy behaviour. I think Iris needs some support here because it sounds like she's being manipulated. At 15 it is incredibly hard to be assertive and stand up for yourself, especially to an older boy who is being pushy. How close are you and Jasmine to Iris?  


I also think you need to hammer home just how horribly creepy Ralph is being. He sounds desperate and verging on being a stalker. Not cool. Some people need this stuff spelled out to them in the bluntest terms. Every time he does something remotely creepy, call it out without mincing your words."
"Agreed.
The Love of my Life has a tattoo on the back His leg of His and an ex’s astrological signs with their birth dates, and while it’s no deal breaker, it fucks with my head every time I see it (which is pretty much daily). He is literally branded with her...
*no likey* 

I haven’t bitched to Him about it as we’ve gotten some years under our belt, but I definitely want it gone at some point. I also intend to cover a 20+ year old tattoo of my own that was picked out by an ex. It doesn’t reference him in any way but it was what he wanted *blech*

Just because others didn’t express distaste doesn’t mean they didn’t take issue with it. "
"&gt; I've actually been spending some time today writing down his last few paycheck amounts, what he contributed to the house, what was spent for necessities, and what he spent on weed. Also writing down how much my mom has spent to cover what couldn't be bought after said weed was acquired. I'm trying to make a visual representation to show him how parasitic he has become.

None of this is really relevant. You already know you have to kick him out. You can't worry about what kind of parent he will be or what he will do to support himself. He has to figure that out for himself. Even if he realizes he is a parasite, he isn't the type who wants to work. He is lazy. Would you really feel comfortable leaving this person in charge of a baby all day while you work? 

Kick him out. Today. Like, come home and suitcases and weed stash waiting on the porch today. And then sign up for any social services you might be eligible for. In California there are a lot of things available for you, maybe the same will be true in your state. "
"I think this is really spot on. 

OP, I had some issues pop up in my mid twenties. I stopped dating because I knew that it wasn't fair to sit on someone while telling them the 'future is cloudy'. I 100% focused on my self. Best thing I ever did.

Once I got my shit together I went out and dated. I met my now husband. We got engaged within the year. If I told him the future is clouded he would have left. Why? Because he has a high degree of self respect. "
"People who are constantly late don't respect other people's times or lives. It's incredibly rude and a very valid reason to end a relationship. This sort of behaviour easily bleeds to other situations and it adds with time. You do not have to put up with it, it's just a question of if you want to deal with it or not. 

ETA: I meant to say ""a lot of people"" or ""most people"". I didn't know people with ADHD experience time differently so obviously that is not the same issue as what's happening to OP's girlfriend given this post. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with ADHD and I will pay attention to my wording so I don't offend or hurt other people's feelings next time. "

"While I do think it's clear you need to reduce your spending,I also agree with your husband. The 2k a year for a cleaning lady is not your problem. You need to be reducing major expenditures or for awhile stop putting into your retirement funds to pay off the debt. Your real problem is you have high costs. You spend 60k a year on daycare. "

I am also seriously wondering why this woman isn’t working at LEAST a part time job. 
"Pregnancy is hard on your body and uses a lot of energy and resources... does he debate this?

You physically can’t take laundry out of the washer at this size... what’s his solution?

Your doctor believes your level of physical activity is harming the fetus... does he care?

I think you should move in with your mother for now. He has escalated his “response” by going on strike. Your ONLY OPTION here (other than doing all his chores) is to show him you are also willing to escalate.

"A guy in college told us his dad was a safe cracker for the CIA.  An agent had  locked himself out of his own safe, so his dad was called in to open it. But the contents of the safe were super secret, so the agent had to have a gun drawn on his dad while his dad worked, to make sure his dad didn't look at the contents once the safe was cracked. But the safe-cracking techniques were *also* super secret, so his dad had to keep a gun drawn on the agent while he cracked the safe, so the agent wouldn't see how he did it.

It was all we could do to keep from laughing until after the guy had left. "

"OP, you can't go no contact with the mother of your daughter -- your minor daughter -- and no reasonable person would ask that. Further, your wife is also asking you to go no contact with your daughter? Surely you know she's far, far over the line. 

Let her go. She's not worth keeping."
"So not only is he bad show runner, he’s also a piece of shit."
"She's in shock, there's this huge aspect of you that she didn't know when she probably thought she knew you through and through.  Now, being bi isn't a huge deal in and of itself, but because of the shock, it probably feels like one to her.  What I would do is keep assuring her she fulfills you sexually and emotionally in life because she's probably feeling like she doesn't with this news.  And tell her being bi doesn't mean you'll ever leave her just the same way being straight doesn't mean you'll ever leave her for a woman.  It's the same thing really.  And then I would talk to her openly and inquire whether you being bi changes her views on you.  What I mean by that is, like, does you being bi make her feel less attracted to you?  Does she think you're less of a man or something?  If she says no well then I'd say she really just needs time to get past the shock of learning this.  We can say sexuality isn't a big deal all we want and doesn't change who a person is and be totally correct, but to a partner you've been with 6 years is kind of is a big thing to learn about their partner. "
"Ive known a few people who I resolved the issue with. An ex who would be hours late, so I pulled the same on him one day. I will be right there, oh 10 minutes. He was waiting outside for me for like 4 hours, to the point he fell asleep on the sidewalk. After that he realized hey, this sort of thing really sucks to do to someone, and he was never late again.

Also, I had a friend like this, and we would just leave her. We would all say hey were meeting for dinner at 7 to carpool. 7:05 we head out. So she would miss out on things, or it would be extra work for her to come, and we wouldn't be waiting. It became that she felt like being late wasn't worth it, and she got how disrespectful it was, so she actually became insanely punctual.

Another friend used to make me wait to go out. So I started calling Ubers instead of volunteering to drive. Cool if you want to make Uber wait 30 minutes, have fun paying the $30 fee while it waits. So she was always on time from then on. 


I think you should pull the same  sort of thing. Don't invest yourself in concrete plans until she proves herself, and move on with your plans without her. You're meeting for a movie at 7? Swing by at 6:45, and if she isn't ready say you'll see her there. 

Either she will shape up, or you will naturally just stop seeing her. I don't really wait around for anyone unless its an emergency. "
"&gt; But I really do love him.

*I* really love hamburgers.  But that doesn't mean that I would eat one if it had cat crap smeared on the bun like a condiment.

He showed you that he could not be trusted.  Love isn't enough to make up for that.

&gt; I always thought if he went and bought a ring and bought a house he changed.

All *those* things mean, in the case of a serial cheater like this, is that he figures that if he gives you enough pretty stuff, he can keep you on the hook for those times when he *isn't* getting any on the side.

He things of you as someone he can buy the favor of.

Let that sink in for a minute."
"I am really surprised more people are not seeing this, and are just focusing on stolen thunder instead of the fact this would make them step siblings. This would also be a legal nightmare for them to get married after the parents do, it might not even be legal to then depending where they live because on paper it would just show someone trying to marry their step sibling. "
"I wrote these words for another Redditor, edited to apply to this situation.

In our modern days, there isn’t much of an opportunity to show courage overcoming true hardship. Of course there are many of us that are born with awful circumstances that go beyond our average lives, especially in the USA, but on average, we have an easy long term lifestyle compared to our ancestors.

Most of us do not have to hunt our food and tackle it to the ground and actually kill to eat.

Most of us don’t have to walk 6 miles to gather water

Most of us do not need to huddle under a sloped roof that leaks and shiver in cold weather 

And we are thankful for these modern conveniences.

Some of what we need to do is courageously say no bullying and facing them head on. Some of us will be asked to do what right even if it scary. 

So in short, I say revel in your ability to show courage under intense pressure, ignore his creepy smile, in fact look over him. Not at him.

It takes incredible courage to face him, show everyone how courageous and strong you are."
"Change the WiFi password so she can't use Netflix any more. You can also get lockable boxes for food in the fridge and the cupboards, just for in the mean time. She will sulk but frankly who cares? She's a grown woman and she shouldn't be acting like this. 

Speak to your husband and tell him she needs to leave and draw up an eviction notice together. I can guarantee if you just tell her to be out by X date without any legal documentation of that, she won't move out.

"
"It's not about whether she ""loves you enough"" or not.  It's about her attempting to get between you and what you and your doctor(s) decide is right for your health.

Anti-depressants are not for everyone, but they have a valid place in treating people, and someone who would force you to reject an entire line of therapy because she believes you ""could improve without it"" is demonstrating that her *wishes* are more important to her than your *needs*.

And that should tell you all you need to know about her.

Drop her like a stone, and do whatever you and your doc(s) believe is best for you."
"Concrete examples of the overestimating: 

You refer to these people as classmates pretty consistently. When I refer to my friends from grad school, I refer to them as my friends from grad school. When I talk about my classmate from grad school -- that's a person I highly respect because of our shared school experience, but for whatever reason we never got close and aren't really friends.  

You think of them as one social group that you are intimate with... But I fail to see how that could possibly be true given the amount of time you've known them and the sheer number of students (under 100...it would have to be like under 10 for me to believe that is true). 

It's pretty bold and cool of you to be so open about your mental health challenges but you gotta know that it unfortunately is a topic that people rather avoid. If you wanted to do it again next year are there a few people you might want to talk to and personally invite, rather than a vague open invite on fb? 



Try to Build genuine friendships with some of your classmates. Your post would be more reasonable if there were 1-2 close friends from school you expected to show up but didn't... But your post is lamenting the fact that no one in your class showed up, which again illustrates how you think of them as one friend conglomerate. They're individuals who you don't seem to have any individual relationship with. "
"OP said her husband makes the high salary, but also that it's not constant, and that they've had a 'cash flow problem' for the last six months. So they haven't been living on the full $210k for the past half year, they've been living on her $60k and his ??? ... but still spending like they expect to see all that money by the end of the year.

Edit: A good example is that her husband might work brokering large corporate deals - things that are months in the making, not totally certain when they'll be closed, but do come with a high payout."

"&gt;invite a lot of people and then split the bill in such a way that they don’t pay


And the wedding is the exact same strategy. He voluntells enough people to pay 4k and HE gets a free week. She can't seem to realise that this is just another scam in a long line of scams. She seems to have quite a blind spot about him. She has got a maggot in her brain about this damn wedding and it's eaten the part that is rational.

Anyway: yes, this is indeed a relationship-breaker. She's placing her family over you. She's demanding that you pay into her brother's scam. She's not respecting your valid reasons. She's also, btw, not apparently offering to open a new line of credit *herself* to pay for you to go - after all, it's her that wants this, not you, so she can fucking well pay for it - but Oh No. And the ceaseless badgering is no way to live.  IF you cave in and do this, you'll end up bitter and resenting her and you'll wanna break up. If you dont, she'll resent you.

I would feel really hurt if my husband wasn’t satisfied with me. Are you not?
"Personally, I'd go to Ask a Manager about this. She's got an HR background and has good insight about these kinds of issues. She usually gives a script for how to handle problematic situations at work, and I think it could be helpful for OP to have a professional provide feedback about the safest way to respond."
"It's concerning that the solution for your anxiety problem is to put yourself in a situation where you don't have to deal with anxiety.

This is literally how people end up shut-in. You start going further and further into yourself. Working a job from home, afraid to drive a car, so you never go out at all. Have groceries delivered.

This is a ruinous path you're going down."
"She explained her motivations clearly.  She wants you to be present.  If you disagree that's necessary, then reply to her reasoning instead of pretending it's somehow hard to understand.  Because it just sounds like you don't believe her.

If it's bothering you, you could say something like:  ""Aw, I like when you text me though.  My friends girlfriends text them.  No one would be bothered by it or anything.""

That would be better than not taking her word at face value I think.  (When I suggested clinginess btw, I said *you*.)"
"Breaking the lease is an option, if you can afford that. You could also put up boundaries - tell her if you need more than one light on at a time, you're going to do that, and also tell her you're not going to respond to interrogations/worries about who is at the door. Tell her iff she has anxiety about those things, it is something she needs to work on herself, she can't control her anxieties by controlling you. Also tell her you need sing-on access to the cameras/app. If she refuses that, tell her in that case, you're not comfortable being filmed, and block, disable (without destroying her property), or remove the cameras."

"I had an ex who told me once that wherever she I was I was welcome. This is the girl I was closest to marrying and still think about from time to time and I love the sentiment. Basically if someone wasn’t okay with me then they weren’t okay with her. I can’t imagine having a partner who was so okay excluding me from their family. IMO you should stick by your partner more, grow a little more spine when it comes to your parents. Btw your parents don’t respect her or your relationships from the looks of this post. Ask all you want in any way you want, but be prepared for them to say no"
"It sounds like OP knows that he exists as a real person, as a friend of a friend.  That’s part of what makes the friend’s obsession and lies kind of scary, because if she’d just made someone up there wouldn’t be the worry of stalking a real person."
i cannot get over the fact of an almost 30 year old man having posters of girls with big tits in his bedroom. still laughing.
"Your family is wrong. How would they have ""fixed"" a stranger being hit by a car?! But sadly while you did the right thing they may never acknowledge it, because they seem too caught up in their own drama and bad choices.

"&gt;His mom came out of her room and laid on top of him (keep in mind she was in a little nightie and he was just in underwear) and stroked his back and snuggled up...*so they both were on top of me.* It looked so intimate that I had a flashback of a threesome I once had back in college.

Gonna be honest, I had to walk away from the computer for a second to process this because I felt the start of a panic attack rising up on your behalf. 

Usually these kinds of posts are tough because it can be hard to tell if the OP is being overly dramatic, but in this case I'm amazed you are as calm about this as you are. This is *not normal.*"
Sounds like she needs therapy to understand that she is being just as abusive as the family she left behind.

"Anyone with a conscience would have looked at this guy’s weeping, humiliated girlfriend and been permanently turned off. This guy is pathetic. "

FIVE LOAVES OF BREAD??
Have you talked to him yet about how his actions make you feel when you go climbing together?
This. Whatever you do dont give her straight up cash. Pay off some of her outstanding debt maybe but dont giver her money for her to do it. Its for her own sake. 
"Also, when he has nobody and comes back to you, please do not go back to him. I know it's difficult when you have such strong feelings, but you've been on your own for a lil now and you seem to be doing great. He seems to be awful. Please, for your own good, do not get back together with him"
"Explain that you work second shift into third shift, and that you aren't available in the mornings/afternoons because of the req of the work and sleep schedule.

"She's right for the most part.  If the two of you are dating in order to find a life partner, a year is enough time to know if you can live with someone for the rest of your life and be happy with that.  And, to tell you the truth, that is what most people need from a marriage.  *Every* relationship has it's ups and downs.  There will be trials and tribulations.  But if you are compatible when it comes to finances, religion, argument style, sex frequency/libido and taste, questions as to kids...then chances are you can do this thing for life if you both put in the effort.  That isn't saying that I don't misunderstand your hesitance.  After all, this is your first real relationship.  But if something is holding you back for real-such as not being sure if something better is out there, she's right.  You need to move on and figure out if you can find a better fit.  Holding on to her while her most fertile years waste away is wrong if you can't even *picture* a life with her after a year.  That's all she really wants to know.  She isn't asking for a ring next week.  She just wants to know that you aren't ""playing it by ear""; stringing her along until something better happens across your path.  She's looking for a husband.  She wants to know that you are looking for a wife.  It's OK if you aren't.  It doesn't make you a bad person.  But refusing to even consider it now that she has asked you to IS disingenuous.  Just be brutally honest about this with yourself.  If something about her is a thorn in your side right now, it will be a bullet in your head after you sign the papers.  Tackle those issues.  And make an adult decision."
"Wow, that's really shitty. It's totally cool for her to be bisexual but it's somehow ""wrong"" for guys?
It's understandable that you wouldn't be comfortable opening up to her after comments like that. However, in order to deal with this, you're going to have to press her on this issue. 
I would say something like, ""wife, do you remember that discussion we had the other night? I want to clear some things up"" and ask her more questions. What is wrong about sex between men? Does she realize that gay/bi men aren't the only people who get AIDS? How does she think her gay friends would feel if they knew she held these opinions? 
If she's only defensive and won't examine her opinions at all, that's a red flag."
"It's heartbreak. It's scary, irrational, and so hard to predict. You may be with someone new, but some part of you still wishes you were with your ex. He was horrible yes, and I can relate because I had an abusive relationship similar, but some part of you is thinking ""if I gave him another chance"" or things along that line. You just need to stay strong, it will be okay."
"She sounds dreadful. What are you getting out of the relationship, apart from learning how to walk on eggshells around her?"
"&gt; To play the devils advocate

The devil has enough advocates."
"I am making a wild guess here, but I suspect that her birth was distressing for her, and she is jealous of what she sees as a much easier Caesarian.

Unfortunately you’re not gonna get much out of her, for a least the next six months or so, due to hormones or exhaustion. Having said that, if she doesn’t make a comment like this again, it is perfectly okay for you to say to her, “That’s really hurtful to me. I had a very difficult and traumatic birth”. If you say this in hurt tone, rather than an angry one, then she won’t really have a leg to stand on. Quiet disappointment is the way to go. 

Like I said, I suspect that something really traumatic happened to her, And this is her way of processing it. It doesn’t mean that she can get away with being unkind to you though. "
"your vagina isn't going to ""get looser"" from sex, and it sounds like he's doing the exact opposite of trying to get you aroused cause it doesn't sound like shaming you is doing it for you.  it doesn't really sound like he actually cares about your pleasure at all, which means that he's the one who sucks in bed.  he should be actively putting in work to get you off and his failure to do that does not make you defective. "
I did tell them exactly what he said to me. I haven't heard from them yet. I know it shouldn't bother me to keep calling but I feel like I'm the one making it a problem (even though I know that's rationally not true)
"Came here to say this.

""Oh, son, you got into Duke and University of Chicago and Cornell and Dartmouth and you're PROUD of that? You want me to be PROUD of you when you could have gotten into Harvard and Stanford if you just hadn't been such a quitter on your baseball team and in the science fair your junior year? No, thanks, how about instead we focus on how you're going to work harder at your second-tier college so you can get into Princeton or MIT for grad school."""
"This is all just my opinion, but here it is - no sugarcoating. Get an abortion. It is far more immoral to bring an unwanted child into the world than it is to have an abortion. You know this guy will damage any child he is a parent to. You know you cannot afford a kid. You know that you will be subjecting this child to terrible circumstances. I do not think it is moral to have this kid when you know how shitty things will be. "
"Okay real talk, I think you need to see a lawyer. I'm completely serious.

At some point the walls (probably the IRS bc it's always the IRS) will come crashing down around your heads and you need to make sure you're not involved to protect your own ass legally speaking. This is gaming the system. And it is illegal. 

Another reason you need to see a lawyer to extricate yourself from his mess is that if you get divorced his ""income"" will cause a tremendous amount of trouble for you.

His fluctuating cash income gives him the ability to absolutely fuck you over when it comes time to declare any assets. He can say he isn't making anything which would very well force you to pay him spousal support. It would also leave you responsible for community debt because he can say ""i don't have it *shrug*"" 

If you have a child (please don't have a child) when you get divorced, he can use this to weasel out of support because it's all income-based.

If he cheats on you and gets someone else pregnant and she comes after him for child support, that will come out of your paycheck because on paper he makes nothing.

But more importantly, if he actually admits to making to all shit under the table, the government will come after you. And the government could hold you both responsible because you've technically been helping him for all these years. 

But even if you don't get divorced you have entangled yourself legally and financially with a damn mess and it will catch up to you and you need to watch out before the student loan people or the IRS start garnishing your wages or he ends up with a criminal record."
"I'm curious, why do you say you know he loves you a lot?  None of this seems very loving. What does he do that shows love?"
"To me this is beyond bizarre. 

your ex sounds terribly manipulative. I absolutely would not contact him again. Unless you send him a short letter without a return address that says something like “stop contacting my parents, we broke up and it’s extremely inappropriate” but getting a reaction is the only reason he’s maintaining this relationship with them. What’s worst your parents are doing the same making you have to react to him. I would be really disappointed in them. 

I would recommend you tell them the whole story in a way they can’t interrupt (letter, video, voicemail) but I fear they would share it with him to discuss. 

Have you had other boyfriends since then? Has he moved on?"
"See, what I find alarming in necrophilia in general (and which is confirmed by your personal  account that your boyfriend dislikes a living, moving partner and has asked \*you\* not to move while having sex with him!) is not the squick factor of decomposition.

It's that, at its very core, it is a fantasy of total control and one-sided pleasure. It is desired by people who are emotionally stunted enough to find it off-putting to connect and exchange with an equal during sex, in a way that is different from a classic dom/sub dynamic or what kinksters call ""consensual nonconsent"".

IE, necrophilia is a fantasy of sex being something you can completely do \*to\* someone, not with them, because by definition the other person isn't there to have any feelings, sensations, or thoughts about it.

It's also a fantasy of violation. It's about doing something to someone who can't do anything about it anymore (because they're dead), and taking something away from/symbolically victimizing that person's loved ones. (Because anyone would be traumatized and violated by the knowledge that someone raped their loved one's corpse.)

\--

The bottom line is: forget shelving this with sex-positivity or whatever. This is not like being with someone who is aroused by feet or poop.

This is about being with someone who is sexually solipsistic, is aroused by the idea of violation, and actually wants to impose that on his \*living partner\*, you.

Even if he never attacks you, treating you this way sexually is incredibly degrading. And you have no guarantee he'll never attack you to ""keep you still"". Please get out and don't feel guilty."
How much do you think you don't want to be with *him* vs how much you want to just not be in *a* relationship? Because it really sounds like you shouldn't be with this guy. 8 years is a very long time and you've done some of you most amount of changing in life. It's extremely possible that you grew apart and it is no longer going to work out.
"As an HR manager I can say that many of these ""go team go"" events are not the brainchild of HR. Most of us hate them. Seriously. It's marketing and executives that seem to love that kind of crap. 

The kind of team building events I've organized recently are escape rooms and axe throwing. 1 event, a meal, and 1-2 speeches lasting 3 minutes max each. And the events and meal location are voted on by the attendees.  Creating songs and dancing? No. Strong pass."
This was an incredible response 
"She's always late because people always accommodate her lateness. 

If you invite her for a family dinner and say you're eating at 5:30, eat at 5:30 whether she's there or not. Start giving yourself a strict time limit of how long you're going to wait at any given place for her - 15 to 20 minutes is plenty. Keep this rule even if she says she's 5 minutes away, even if she shows up as you're leaving. "
"&gt;It could just be that she was very passionate **at that time in her life** and in a new relationship

(emphasis mine)

Yeah, I wrote my first serious boyfriend straight up love notes about how we'd be together forever and I loved everything about him, yadda yadda.

Spoiler alert! We're not together anymore. I'm getting married next year to a man that is my first bf's superior in every imaginable way. I've never written him a love letter. Because I am not young and inexperienced anymore and that kind of super demonstrative verbal outpouring is not how I show my love as the person I am today! My first BF was NOT the love of my life, not even close, and I'd be dumbfounded if my fiance now ever thought I considered him second-best because of a note I might still have in decades-old emails.

You really need to get over your anger on this, OP. I understand, separate from the issue of this other man, if you would have liked to hear more from your wife while you were in Iraq. But even then, if that's not something that would have occurred to you without knowing about the existence of these other emails, you should probably let that go, too. It's in the past and if your wife has given you no other reason to believe she's still holding a candle for him, these are a lot of really wild and damaging assumptions."
I was terrified of being a single mom until I discovered it's a lot easier than carrying the weight of both a child and an adult man. Much less emotionally painful too.
You are right. The string along will continue. God I don't really want to break up but I deserve someone who is enthusiastic about being with me
"I’m gonna throw in my usual piece of advice for situations like this, because sometimes posters here (not the person above, but in general) get trigger-happy with stuff like “your parents are awful and you should cut them out”:

Your mom *is* awful, but paying your way through school is really fucking hard. There’s no shame in playing nice with her if that’s what it takes to get financial support. If you have to rationalize it, buy Emily a really nice wedding present and do her plenty of favors, and think of it as making up for your mother’s cruelty to her by proxy."
"I noticed that too. Also there seems to be a lot of ""they know where I am"" but not much mention of ""I actively tried to make concrete plans and follow up on them"". I'm kind of picturing this being stuff like ""I'll be in your area soon!"" ""oh cool, we should get together!"" ""totally! we should do that!"" and then no real follow up. I see one mention of actually trying to hang out within a specific time frame being thwarted by a work schedule, but that's pretty different from a pattern of Amy *always* being busy and dodging questions like ""Oh, then what's a better day/time for us to get together?""

The impression I get is that these OP and these girls have more of a proximityfriendship, where they're friends and enjoy each other's company when they're at college together, but not really close or interested enough to get together when it would involve planning and travel (even if that's an hour). Lots of school friendships are like that, so I don't mean it in any negative way. I understand why it's hard to OP to see the differences in their kind of friendship so starkly; I imagine it was a lot less obvious when they were all at school."
It sounds like he's less of a clueless idiot and more of a straight up jerk. 
"How much of the time of her sister's visit have you been spending with them? If you're with them 10% of the time, and the events you're there for are about you getting to know her sister, then they're definitely being rude. If you're with them 80% of the time, and it's just you casually hanging out with them, then probably what's going on here is that you need to give them more space to be themselves without you there.

There are a gajillion reasons that they would want to speak their native language to each other. Imagine, for instance, all the inside jokes one might have with one's sibling from growing up that just wouldn't translate to another language. And even for people who appear fluent in a non-native language, like her sister, it can still be quite mentally draining to speak it all the time."
Ok here's what you do: Get a family recipe and tell her you loved loved loved this as a kid and that you want her to make it in the exact same way because it would mean so much to you etc etc etc. and if she does it correctly praise the shit out of it. 
Yeah I am 99% sure I already know who your husband is. You might want to change some details because it's super easy to find his name right now.
"She has been honest in communicating about her needs. You need to take that in. 

If the threesome stuff is too much for you (those aren't for everyone), focus on the other parts of what she has talked about. 

Are you making sure she is getting off before you guys move into PIV? The amount of time you last isn't something you can *necessarily* change, though there are techniques out there you can read about which might be helpful over time. 

You know what doesn't have a refractory period? Your other body parts. If she has toys she likes to use, *you* can use them on her. 

This is not an unsolvable problem. "
especially when she's forking over $300 because HE couldn't make a reservation in time. Something tells me this is just the tip of the iceberg
"Please, OP, listen to this.  At the very least, talk to your daughter and see what she wants here.  Nothing is more devastating to a child than knowing that you come second (or lower) in your parent’s priorities.  

That shit haunts me constantly, and I don’t ever think I’m going to fully recover, honestly.  I’m always going to be, at most, second place to everyone, and no amount of friends, or boyfriends, or drugs, or counceling, or...anything else will fix that.

You only get one relationship with your daughter.  Please cherish it."
"Your message was fine, the girl was just a young idiot.

I suggest you ignore other people's rules about communicating and esp. BS rules about ""Don't ever send a follow up"" or ""wait some arbitrary time before contacting"" or ""if they don't text within an hour they don't really care.""

Actually, don't just ignore the rules, ignore people who have those rules. They are idiots, trying to stick to rules because life is just a bit too complex for them to handle on the fly.

Speak when you want to and keep it polite and you cannot go too far wrong."
"I'm pretty sure once all of us are aware, it's gonna turn out we're like the Halliwell sisters and develop super powers along with an awesome bond. "
"This happened to me once. I was dumped for someone else, and she turned my ex down and humiliated him. It hurt to be dumped, but I can honestly say seeing her reject him soothed the pain immensely. Stay strong, OP. You deserve better than someone who would actively pursue another woman in front of his girlfriend. That’s so low, and it reflects poorly on his character. "
"&gt; Frankly, it sounds like they didn't mind being racists until your grandparents cut them off. 

Oh  of course, it's obvious when you put it like that: he just wants back on the family Trust-fund cash nipple!"
"My friend, you are burning out. You seriously need a change of scene. Don't ask me how I know.  There are lots of universities, in all sorts of nice places. Sit down with your wife and pick a target region.

Why are you still at the same university where you got your doctorate? That's a recipe for disaster. You and your wife are like two wagon wheels, stuck in the same ruts for miles and miles, as you cross the endless prairie with gritted teeth. Take a turn and go somewhere else. ""Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer..."""
"Right?? You'd also think someone in HR would be friendly and nice. 

The only other people above her are the owners- who are out of the country for the summer. "
"This goes far beyond a confrontation between taking some time for yourself and your wife wanting you to do chores.  From all of the words you wrote, I can tell that she doesn't ever really consider your needs to be valid.

I want you to read and re-read that last statement carefully, and I""ll repeat for emphasis: YOUR WIFE DOESN'T CONSIDER YOUR NEEDS TO BE VALID.

Now, go take some time to think about this.   I can tell you're that sort anyway.   I can count at least four examples that back up my assertion in what you've written...can you?

You are an adult human being with agency.   Stand up for your needs, make them known, and see to it that they get met.   "

"&gt; My income is 6x more than his, and I contribute every last penny to the family budget.

He's already using her. "
"&gt;BUT if you were okay not EVER developing feelings, then go for it.

I would be ok with never developing feelings. That's not the issue. I'd be happy to be acquaintances I think.   
But the main issue is more of a philosophical and self-respect one. He prioritised his friends over me, and denied me the friendship/partnership part in our relationship. He is extremely committed to his friends- as in hoping to keep them for the rest of his life. I don't think I want this level of commitment to someone who just dumped me and refused to treat me as a partner! I also don't feel comfortable with the intimacy that comes with such committed friendships - his other friendships interfered with our relationship. Why would I want to give him this intimacy now, after he couldn't give it to me when we were together? "
"Poor OP mentioned that GF doesn't even eat much of her own food, and I hate to think it's because she knows it's not good. 
""she enjoys cooking because she does it for me not because she likes food all that much"""
"I’ll tell you what my dad said to me when I got engaged “do not do this because you think it’s the next step, or expected, ot to make her happy, or for kids, or to keep her around longer.  It will not end well for anyone involved if any of that is your motivation”"
"&gt;Our child was somewhat unexpected, and **she did not really want to keep her at first, but i managed to convince her.**

And you wonder why she's not as invested in the kid as you are?

I'm not justifying your GF's attitude: ultimately it was her decision to have the kid and that *should* entail her accepting her role as a parent. She's doing a shitty thing to your child with her neglect and disinterest.

However, you can't change her attitude. You can't make her love her child anymore than you can make her spend more time with her child. You can suggest parenting classes that the two of you take together, or you can plan more family outings/fun stuff to do all together, but she may not agree to participate. Ultimately you just need to consider yourself a single parent."
"Chef here. 

You think your hours are long now? Just wait until you are a cook -- you will work 10+ hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week, often without breaks or overtime. The restaurant industy is shit to its employees and you have to be a masochist to love it and live it. You will miss every holiday, every birthday, every weekend, funerals, weddings, births, you name it. No one will ever thank you. We are not 9-to-5 weekend warriors -- we are the busiest when everyone else is on vacation.

Worse yet: you will start at the bottom. It will take years before anyone wants your opinion.  You will get yelled at by people half your age. Being a chef is a title you earn through psychotic dedication and relentless hard work (and not by playing chef in your home kitchen).

I very sincerely recommend you have an exit plan for your exit plan... you will miss your old job within a month. "
"Dude. Have a little dignity. You’re worth more than this loser and yes, he DID sexually harass those girls. Yes, he tried to cheat on you and he will try to cheat on you again. Finally, YES, you should cut him off. He’s a creep and you shouldn’t stay with him under any circumstances. He doesn’t respect you and BLATANTLY told you he’d cheat on you if you didn’t let him monopolize your time. He’s manipulating and trying to isolate you. 

I’m going to be honest with you. If you continue dating him, the odds are that your friends will cut you off as well. He is a predator and your friends have expressed their discomfort with him. If you continue to enable and excuse his actions because you ~love~ him, then more power to you. But you won’t keep your friends. Nothing went farther than him desperately DMing other girls, only because they were grossed out by him and didn’t want to sleep with him. If any of those ten people said yes, he would have gone through with it without a second thought. He does not respect you or your relationship, and he is trying to make HIS cheating your fault because you ‘neglected’ him. It’s bullshit.

He’s going to cheat on you again. Have some self respect and cut this loser off. The age difference is icky, his behavior is disgusting, and his treatment of you is abhorrent. Please have some dignity and open your eyes to his actions. Don’t help him abuse your trust and ruin your friendships."
