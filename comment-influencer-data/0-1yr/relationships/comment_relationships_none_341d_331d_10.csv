"Oh dear.

&gt; He told me that he broke up with me once so he can do it again if I don't stop pestering him about it. 

Do you really want to be in a relationship with such a shitty person that says something like this to you?"
"Dude was looking for a free pass to bang another woman. Give him a lifetime membership. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold Mr. or Miss Dude!"
"Texting an old friend? Fine. Not mentioning it? Also fine, for me anyway. Telling a friend you love them? Somewhat unusual, but OK. **Lying about it?** There's the problem. I think leaving didn't help the situation though, because that just gives her more time to trickle truth you, make up excuses, and spin the facts. The facts that matter are:

* She said she texted him every couple of weeks - that's a lie.
* She said she deletes everyone's texts - that's a lie.

Those things need an explanation. And who knows, there might **be** an explanation, but the fact that she's getting mad and calling you controlling, rather than simply explaining the situation, is a red flag. No derailing into ""oh I tell everyone I love them"" - that's a whole other conversation. Those two things she said were flat out untrue, and you deserve to know the actual truth behind them."
"Sleep on it and try to talk again tomorrow. honestly, if he is gone 75% of the time, and you are working too, it's not unreasonable to get a sitter once or twice a month. If he is adamant that you don't do this, then you need to tell him

""Listen, I'm doing this alone 75% of the time and you are not here/available to even speak to. *You aren't here* and there is absolutely no reason why I can't use the money I earn to go out once or twice a month."". 

Because it's true. I garauntee he is not working 24/7 for 3 weeks straight. it's not easy to be away from your family for 75% of the time, bit at the same time, it's not easy to be ""on"" 100% of the time because he isn't there. Downtime when the kid goes to sleep is *not* downtime, especially when you are doing the picking up after a long day of a wild child running around. 

He's in the wrong. Once or twice a month is NOT too much to ask for a few hours to yourself with friends. "
"Hi, your boyfriend is a fucking moron, hope this helps."

"First, I am sorry for your loss. My wife passed away in June (suicide) the day before her 42nd birthday. We had been together for 20 years. She did not leave a suicide note so I went through her phone and computer to try and find some reason as to the why. I found that she had been having an affair with another man as well as had other infidelity. 

I was devastated by her death and felt betrayed by what I found. The grief of the sudden loss of your spouse at such a young age is so difficult to process and almost too much with the betrayal found afterwards. I don't have all the answers. I am still working through all of this myself. I will echo the other comments in that you should seek out some sort of therapy and widow/widower support group as soon as possible. I found strength in Al Anon as my wife was an alcoholic and being able to listen to the stories of others who have gone through many of the same things will help you see that you are not alone and that there is hope - that is why I recommend a widow support group as well.

As far as how to deal with it, time doesn't heal all wounds. This is something that you will need to learn to deal with so you can move forward in your life in a healthy way. You will never be ""Ok"" like you were before this but you will find a new ""Ok"" in your life.  

My advice is that it is ok to grieve according to the emotions that will and have certainly come to you. You can still be angry at your spouse but it is also ok to miss them and to love them. Just grieve - don't feel guilty or silly about it based upon what you found. That grief will always be there. You never know what situation, word or thing may bring them up and catch you unexpectedly. For me, I would and still do find pieces of my wife's long red hair on me or around the house sometimes. That shit is hard but it is ok to feel it, to cry and to grieve however you feel. The key in moving forward is getting the therapy and support group you need to learn how to deal with it and move forward in a healthy way. From one Widower to another widow - take it slow in everything and especially when you get to a new relationship. You will know what I mean when you get there. 

Best wishes and you are in my thoughts and prayers.

&amp;#x200B;"
I'd talk to her about it again and if she's unwilling to help or even be civil and admit she's at fault then stop giving her rides/help of any kind.
"Sorry to be harsh but you and your boyfriend both need to grow a back bone here.

“No, we can’t babysit, we have plans.”

And then allow no further discussion."

"So, this one night, 11 years ago, my buddy and I went out clubbing with two girls we knew. We both wanted Casey, but Melissa was there too. 

My friend ended up making out with Casey, I was dancing with Melissa, I figured, well, why not have some fun tonight, and I made out with her.

Melissa and I ended up making out in clubs a few more times, so did my friend and Casey. We both ended up going on dates with them too (individually). I realized Melissa was great, he realized Casey...wasn't.

Now I'm married to Melissa. Now, I've never told her that she was my second choice, that **one** particular night...your boyfriend is an idiot for doing so, that's another story. My friend chose to keep something going on with Casey for less than a year, I married Melissa. 

My point is, you were second choice **then,** you **are not** second choice now. He's an idiot for bringing this up, but, with alcohol, he might have that it's just a funny story.

Ask him if you're still his second choice, he will definitely answer with no, because you aren't, because he wouldn't have stuck with you nine years if you were.

Then tell him you're hurt he said that (because you are) and that you'll need some time (because you will), and it will all blow over.   "
"&gt;  She's the kindest person I've ever met. I've known her for three years and she's always been a loyal friend and loyal partner. Also, early this year she helped me avoid the mistake of proposing to my girlfriend at the time. She saw my girlfriend making out with someone else so she told me because she knew I was planning to propose. Turned out my ex had been cheating on me for a few months. My brother's fiancee helped me through the breakup. I was a mess at the time and my brother was overseas for training. She was the one taking care of me and helping me move out of my ex's apartment. I truly see her as a sister and a close friend, which is why I'm feeling really guilty for not doing anything about this.

Do not let this gem of a woman walk down the aisle without knowing all the facts. She saved you -- now it's your turn to save her."
"He knows exactly what he’s doing. It’s to punish you. That’s why those conversations go nowhere- this is a game he’s playing because you have proven that it works. Gave up your hobbies and passions over a man giving you the silent treatment. He’s not going to set down such an effective weapon against you.

Start giving him credit for the way that he thinks. He is showing and telling you exactly who he is and what he is willing to do to get what he wants and maintain control. Believe him."
"You don't have any options.


Your husband is only going out with you BECAUSE his mom told him too.  


You have a few options:

- Leave your son at home with a family member or babysitter.  You can't handle two kids at the same time.


- say, lets do simple things, like walk around a park.  


- Include your husband's mom, so she can teach him manners


Eventually consider divorce."
"&gt; “Truth hurts. You have to be nasty to build people up.”

Honestly, that should tell you all you need to know about this guy."
"Here's the deal.  I'm a single parent, and I rock.  When I wasn't a single parent, my child lived in a broken home.  His mother cheated with anything that would hold still long enough and was emotionally abusive on top of that.

Now, I have spilt custody and in one of my son's homes he has a parent who loves him and puts his needs first.  At least one home where his emotional needs and development are being looked after by a whole and healthy parent.  He didn't have that before.  My son came from a broken home and I'm fixing that.  Your husband has broken your child's home, is he going to fix it or will you?  I've got my money on you.  You got this.
"
This is one of the cruelest things I've ever read here. Your husband sounds like a monster.
"When my wife's friend grabbed my crotch while I was helping her walk(everyone was drunk), I looked at her instantly and saw that it wasn't an accident, then I dropped her drunk ass on the ground.

I then grabbed my wife and we left.  That was 5 years ago and I haven't seen/talked to her again.

That is how an innocent man acts in those circumstances.

Your husband gaslighting you really seems like a way to keep this marriage\affair going as long as possible before it blows up in his face.

I'm stunned that you will even socialize with a woman who you know if trying to get your husband.  But from what you have said I would figure that they are having an affair.
"
"*I do all the cleaning, bill paying and grocery buying, laundry and dishes and he treats me like I’m a piece of shit.*

Why are you with him?

If he won't leave, why don't you?"
[deleted]
Wow. Good for both of you that the communication ended up working and you're happy together now. Congrats and hope it works out.
Fuck this was exhausting just to read.
"I don't know what to tell you. Personally, I would not marry a person I only see once a month.  

The missing out part is... so abstract. You can think that of any and all relationships but at the same time sometimes it's just true so you cant just write it off.  "
"The only reason you need to not want children is that you don't want children. That being said, I wouldn't give potential dates your whole medical history so early in the relationship. Just be up front about not wanting kids and only let them know about your medical history if/when things get more serious. You're overwhelming people at the start and it's pushing them away. I get that you don't want to ""hide"" your medical history, but there is such a thing as oversharing. Maybe mention that you have some medical issues if you want to be honest, but you don't need to list everything out IMO."
"He'll take a day off to shut you up?? Wooowwww what an amazing man. And he loves you too much to let you break up with him because you are clearly doing it because you must be on the rag, not because you have legitimate feelings that deserve recognition and respect? Relationship goals right here.

Girl, get out. You don't need his permission to leave. If you can,  pack up and move out while he's visiting his dog.

"
"Your boyfriend is far too stupid to date. let this four day break become a break-up, and date someone with an IQ above the mean."
"You are completely underreacting to what happened. Your boss is a 26 year old man, he is responsible for his actions. He drunkely called his barely legal employee and told her to come to his office so he could fuck her at 4 in the morning. C'mon girl."
[removed]
"He is deeeeeeeeply insecure. You will always be too smart, too friendly to other men and earn too much for him to be happy. Guys like him need to keep women small to make themselves feel big.

He is not worth your time."
It was cheating. Plain and simple. There’s not even any question about it. Stop with the ‘technicalities’. He cheated on you. Leave that fool and tell him this is what he gets for playing with your heart.
"Even though it’s hard, I think you need to stick with it. The fact that he waited a day and a half, and then didn’t even acknowledge your concerns, is evidence enough that he doesn’t care enough about you to put in the work. Don’t let him control whether or not you break up, he doesn’t get to override your decisions. The way I read it, he just wants to sweep things under the rug, and is confident that you’re attached enough to let him. Be strong &lt;3"
"You married the guy, you already picked a side. Why aren't you defending him? He was defending you, that's how this all came about.

Sounds like your husband has taken a lot from your parents, without you stepping in. When are you planning on doing that? Because the longer you don't, and it sounds it's been 3 years so far, the bigger a chance that eventually this will be a dealbreaker. Especially if you involve kids your family will lay a claim on. At some point, you'll have to find your spine."
"I have a very similar reaction. There was a time that my husband got frustrated trying to find a particular letter and got increasingly angry until he was yelling. 

He wasn't upset at me but it made me freeze. In that moment it was like time stopped and for just a moment i was afraid that he was going to hurt me.

Now i know that he would NEVER do anything to hurt me but i grew up in a horribly abusive situation where if a man got angry a beating was guaranteed to follow. My husband was a little hurt by this because my reaction was a little extreme.

I explained to him that it's kind of like when someone rings your doorbell and you open the door to get punched in the face. After awhile the sound of a doorbell terrifies you. Just be patient with her. With time this grows smaller and she will be less afraid. Especially if she feels she is in a loving and stable place."
"He doesn't get to have his cake and eat it too. If he isn't willing to work on his relationship with you first, then no, he can't have a relationship with your kid."
 Razor burn looks nothing like any STD... Your boyfriend is an idiot.
"I haven't seen this response yet but why the hell do you have to ""plead your case"" for responsibly acquiring childcare so that you could join a friend for a night out? 

Does your husband not ""allow"" you to go out with friends? When you had a child, did he assume you would forever be shackled to your house, only to leave to run family errands or serve his needs? Did he expect you to become a robot: eat, work, mother, sleep, repeat? 

I don't know what you should do, because it is ridiculous to me that someone who isn't even present most of the time would have the nerve to dictate how the person who is should spend their time and money. One night isn't likely to break your budget and I'm sure you need something to look forward to once in awhile.

What I would do is say ""for my mental and emotional well being I needed a night with a friend out of the house. I can't fully be a successful wife and mother, and provide the nurturing and care I do without also having a full life. You can't draw water from a dry well."" If you are feeling generous, maybe ask him, ""Do you ever feel like you just need a break with friends but can'tfind the time for it? Is there something you would like to do with your friends when you are home?"""
"I'm sorry that it didn't end up working out, but I'm glad that neither of you felt compelled to compromise your values in a way that could only have made you both unhappy in time."
Yes it's a huge red flag. If he spends 30 minutes denigrating you for talking to somebody about books at a party (events in which you socialise) then that's very bad.
She grabbed his crotch in front of you! That's a bold statement of that dick is mine as well. Your husband's fake naivety is simply impossible to believe. We are all adults here...no one flirts with you so obviously and you don't notice. The question now is are you going to allow them keep playing these games or will you find out the truth even at the cost of your precious circle.
"You have every right to have friends over whenever you want. You pay rent for your space, you are entitled to do anything in that space provided it's not a violation of the (sub)lease. 

HOWEVER...

Part of being a good roommate is reaching a compromise. She seems amenable to visitors, just said something about it being too frequent. It could just be that you caught her in a bad mood and she would prefer to come home to a quiet place. It could be that she wishes she was invited. It just seems odd that she would suddenly have an issue after a year and a half living together.

I'd suggest asking if you could talk face-to-face to work out an agreeable middle ground where you can still host get-togethers but no more than one a week (or something). Perhaps ask if there was any other motive behind her request at that point. "
"&gt;I’d feel bad making her do something that would be a 30 minute excursion for her, yet take me just 3 minutes. So I begrudgingly deal with it.

Why are your feelings less important than hers? And don't forget, **she chose this arrangement.** She set up the AirBnB knowing she lived 10 minutes away. So STOP! Or if nothing else, start playing the ""sorry, I'm busy"" card a LOT more often. When you actually don't mind doing it? Sure, do it. When you just can't be bothered? ""Sorry, can't do it this time"". Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain). This isn't ""helpful neighbor"" this is ""doormat"". Start saying no, politely. You owe her nothing, and if she gets mad at you for not doing her favours that's on her, not you."
"I will disagree with the others and say hormonal bc can turn you into a nutjob. I've seen it with two friends. However, if that's the case she needs to see her doctor asap and get switched to something else. If she was like this before then she's just using it as an excuse."
Nah dude. Don't wait around for other people. He's made it clear that your life plans are incompatible and you should just move on.
"&gt;I garauntee he is not working 24/7 for 3 weeks straight.

Yeah, pretty easy for a guy who has weekends and evenings (presumably) 100% free to complain about his wife spending money to get a *few hours a month*. What a selfish jerk."
"He's allowed to have preferences, but he's not allowed to tell you how to live your life. Ultimately, if the makeup thing doesn't work for him, he should not be dating you. Conversely, you deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are, makeup or no makeup."
"I'm sure you'll get a lot of good advice, so I'll just say one thing:

You can definitely walk out -- in a bit. You don't have to do it today! People often act as though you must leave a bad marriage NOW, and that seems to be how you're imagining things since you're so upset being around him. I understand. It would indeed be ideal to be able to just leave now.

But I understand why you can't.

So instead you can set a timeline that makes sense to you and start getting your ducks in a row. Keep it to yourself so he doesn't realize what is about to happen and can't try to thwart you. Plan, plan, plan. Accept help from anyone who offers it sincerely. Get back to work, save money, figure out where you'll go, talk to lawyers -- all that. It's fine to do one small thing at a time in preparation. Just make sure not to lose your motivation to go. 

I'm so sorry he did this. It really is unforgivable. 

*hugs, if you're a hugger"
Yeah this guys sounds like an absolute fucking asshole.
Just ask him why he’s so obsessed with your weight. Fair question- you really want to know. 
Leave him for a weekend with all four of the kids. 
"""Hey shitbird, I only have this painful and inconvenient rash because I was trying to appease YOUR preference. If you're gonna be an ungrateful little dildo about it then perhaps I actually SHOULD go out and find someone new to fuck. Bye."""
"&gt; I can not bare to throw a wrench in our friendship 

i'm headed out the door so i don't have time to type more but GIRL THIS WOMAN IS NOT A FRIEND TO YOU!! maybe she was once - but that just makes what she's doing now WORSE!!!!"
"You don’t want to cause trouble with Anna??

Then get used to her fucking your husband.

Either this is a decent piece of fiction, or you’re a complete doormat."
"Your husband sounds awesome :)

And he’s right. Your mom needs to acknowledge that you have the right to set the rules for your family and your household, and if she won’t agree to abide by those rules then she’s not welcome. 

Say that to her in a message or in text—you will probably be less anxious if you do that vs. a phone call. I’d actually stop talking to her on the phone altogether for a while and just message her so you can prepare your responses. 

But stop arguing with her about this. Just stop. You don’t need to explain your reasoning to her. What she thinks doesn’t matter. The only thing that does matter is whether she will respect your wishes in your home and with regard to your kids."
"&gt; He had lunch with her 2 times before I found out, and had her alone in his truck 

&gt; I asked to see his phone, even tried to grab it from him, and he wouldn't let me see it. He got in his truck and took off, and came back 20 minutes later, and still wouldn't let me see his phone.

&gt; The next day, his instagram was deleted.

First of all, the size and measuring story was total crap. There's no way in this universe that's a believable story. Second, the actions above are not the actions of an innocent man. 

I'm sorry that you have to deal with this OP, but you know in your heart what's happening. 
"
Now it’s your time to break up
And remember that plans can totally be lounging on the couch watching Netflix. Your time is yours to spend however you wish.
"You’d want him to tell you if it was the other way around, right? He just wants you to be happy, not suffer in silence. Maybe the chair can become his chair and you two can look for another one you can try out in person at an office supply store or furniture store. "
"Every time I see a post like this I have to wonder what else is going on in the relationship. OP, what else changed about a year ago?"
Counseling’s in your immediate future.   Both to deal with the loss and this revelation..  
[deleted]
"""I won't be needing your services anymore. Thank you for the past 2 years. Best of luck.""

Just a question. Was she going to be cooking your meal or hers?"
"Your girlfriend is being abusive and blaming you for the abuse. There’s no context that makes physical punishment acceptable. 

She says it’s because she’s emotional and you’re shutting her down. But what does hurting you do to change that? Hurting someone isn’t a healthy way to solve a problem, you’re not going to pinch a way to a solution. It’s not about solving the problem - it’s about hurting you in retribution and controlling your behavior because you don’t want to be pinched next time. I bet she doesn’t pinch friends or co workers when they have a personal problem. 


You leave immediately. She’s manipulative and won’t change. "
"Look, your husband is a huge asshole. I know things are very complicated for you and I understand that divorce is not an easy option. But you have to understand that this goes WAY beyond a little social awkwardness or whatever. Your husband is incredibly selfish, demanding, impatient, narcissistic... to say the least. He has absolutely no respect for you and obviously doesn't help much with your son. Oh and he's also an idiot...not wanting him to eat fruit because it's ""feminine""?? Fucking lol. That comment alone guarantees a healthy dose of misogyny is in there too.

What country are you in? What are your options, realistically? If you're in the US or a similar country I would say divorce him yesterday, being a single parent is better than this shit and you can get financial help from the government. However I assume you're in a country where that's not a feasible option... so the way I see it you can either confront him, or try to get things back how they were where he's working all the time and isn't around you. I cannot imagine confronting him or talking about it will work. He sounds so far beyond basic human decency that he would probably just lash out at you for criticizing him. 

What about his parents? Do they seem to notice/criticize these behaviors or are they totally on his side? How is YOUR relationship with them? Basically, could you enlist them to help change him if he won't listen to you?

&amp;#x200B;"
"You were extremely fortunate to get him out without something bad happening. This guy is bad news and he's not throwing up red flags, he posted a huge red billboard.

He came to your house to hang out agreeing to no sex, and he lied to you that he understood and accepted that just to get inside and hopefully coerce you into something you weren't comfortable with. That's incredibly predatory. Now he's trying to manipulate you.

You owed him nothing. It was your first time meeting him. Get out means get the fuck out, you weren't even rude about it. Block him, please do not invite him over again."
"&gt; But after I insisted, he said he thinks I've been masculinized due to being raised by a dad and with three brother of similar age. He's worried that I'm going to be masculinized even more during this visit.

Your boyfriend is literally saying that he doesn’t like the person that you are / the person that your family raised you to be. I know this sub tends to be dramatic, but if this isn’t breakup worthy, I don’t know what is. “I’m worried that spending time around your family will make you think it’s okay to be the way that you are” should absolutely be a dealbreaker unless your family is abusive, toxic, etc. "
"&gt; he could marry me after school in another 4 years

4 years is an *incredibly* long time to wait if you're ready to be married now, especially after 5.5 years together. 4 years is enough time to go from first-date to wedding with someone entirely new. Unless you're 100% happy with your relationship now and are happy to go through another 4 years of it, why would you waste *years* waiting to see what happens?

That said, you don't sound 100% happy:

&gt; see each other at the same frequency as the other previous years when we lived close to each other. I go home to see him every month

So you only really see him once a month? Even when you lived nearby? You go home to see him, does he ever go to see you?

&gt;I actually had to be the one to ask for dates and for affection on the rare occasions. 

&gt; The thought that I think I wasted a good chunk of time with my boyfriend crossed my mind a few times. 

&gt; I move back to our city, he still won't marry me then. And I'll be stuck in a city I don't want to live in

&gt; There are many benefits in keeping me around

This sounds less like a healthy committed relationship, and more like a semi-regular mutually beneficial meet-up between two people who don't want to go to the effort of finding a better match. Marriage isn't the next step for you guys; breaking up and re-evaluating what you really want out of life is. 

"
"If you’re going to stay a little while with him, I would suggest that you do so with the goal of leaving him eventually. Reach out to family if you can to see if anyone will take you in while you find your feet. Because this is not sustainable. He emotionally cheated and badmouthed you, abandoned you, and has made it very clear that the onus is on you to suck it up and deal with it. If he’s not willing to even admit that he acted wrongly at any point, he will continue to be an abhorrent husband. 

Your kid will be far better off growing up in separate but harmonious homes rather than a house where one or both parents are miserable. Take it from someone who’s parents should have divorced: that kind of upbringing can make your childhood miserable and your adulthood difficult as well. "
"&gt; I'd rather help him do it in a kind, understanding way. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is no kind, understanding way to bring up what I am sure she considered a minor thing from *six months ago.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In general, if I, a woman, was approached by a man I didn't know who was  upset about something that happened six months ago, I would run. I  would fucking run. 

Exactly. He's going to look unstable at best here, like he's been obsessing (which it seems he has). He has basically no leg to stand on here, either. Outside of the specified feedback period in the class, which he did participate in, he has no standing to offer her that kind of feedback, nor any reason to believe she'd be receptive to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I would talk to him about risk versus reward here. What's the best possible outcome, versus the worst? Is it REALLY worth risking one to potentially achieve the other?"
"It sounds like he really isnt that into you. Refuses to move closer, refuses to move in with you when it would benefit him, you have to initiate the majority of dates, you have to ask for affection, etc. You only even see him when *you* put in all of the effort to visit him. After five years he should be doing what he can to close the gap in your LDR and should be putting in equal effort to see you, give you affection, etc. If he isnt doing that by now, he wont ever. "
"Your sister should not be the only person in therapy.  Family therapy for you, her, and your mom would be best.  I completely understand how difficult your situation is...I've been there, too.  Unfortunately, your ex-step father is part of the reason why your sister treats you this way.  She is mimicking the same attitude, which is sad.  I understand this is difficult for your mom, but she has to establish healthy boundaries for the 3 of you.  You are an adult, but that is her child.  Your mom has to be the one to discipline your sister and hold her accountable for her actions."
"My wife and I waited on marriage to have intercourse. We immediately went into a deadbedroom. We had unsatisfying sex with very low frequency for almost two decades. I wish we had sex before marriage and could have worked out the issues surrounding sex for her before we got married.

We worked out finances. We worked out kids and his we would raise them in the future. We worked out sharing responsibilities at home. The only area we didn't work out was sex and it was a dark cloud over our marriage for 19 years. "
"Leave your boyfriend to babysit on his own. Like, he says ""oh by the way, I agreed to babysit this Saturday"" and you say ""great, I was needing a spa day"" and then **leave the house**.

Alternately, look up the going rate in your area for babysitting small children, double it for the annoyance, and when your bf's brothers demand childcare, quote them your babysitting rate."
"Why *wouldn't* you want to break up with him?   This guy values you so little that he showed your naked photos to his skeezy buddies.    

He has no respect for you.  Show him that you have respect for yourself."
"People wouldn't make such a big deal about monogamy if it was *easy*. 

Every day, you have a choice. You have a choice to invest in this crush and nurture it, or starve it and kill it. You have a choice to invest in your husband or your crush. 

It's totally normal to get crushes on people when you're married. It's part of being human. But part of being a good partner is recognizing those crushes and refusing to indulge in them."
"&gt; but I would appreciate an apology and an offer to pay for some of the repair, and I do feel like this issue needs to be dealt with since we live on the same property and see one another every day, how do propose I deal with this?

Forget an apology. Maybe consider raising her rent next lease in a way that is commensurate with the cost. 

Also, stop loaning her your stuff since she has proven she won't repay kindness with gratitude. "
"&gt; He refuses to end things, that's his choice. Fine. That doesn't mean a thing if you want to leave. Breaking up doesn't have to be a mutual decision. It so often isn't. So far as break ups go, this one seems well earned.
&gt;

Also, if OP is scared of being the bad guy: someone has to be. I dated someone who went on and on about how they would ""never break up with me"" and how ""if the relationship ended it would be because of me."" What they were really telling me is that I was predetermined to be the villain in the relationship.

 Don't worry about him, he'll be okay. Worry about *you*. He obviously doesn't care about your feelings, so you shouldn't care about his."
Huge red flag. He at first called you a liar about lending him money and then told you it’s no big deal? That’s fucked up
"I agree with you...at the same time, I would start to pull back on helping her.  


She could have told you the truth beforehand and lied instead.  When confronted, she blamed you.


If you and your wife wanted, go to the in-laws and let them know. I would want to know because I would wonder how she's keeping the apartment."
"Writing all of this out must have been very cathartic for you, wasn't it?

I think you already know what you should do. She's not a ""best friend""; she's the person you write ""Happy birthday!"" on their Facebook wall every year but never see."
"""Lying about it? There's the problem...""

That is your reality check."
"Someone explain to me how this is a prank? Your ""imagination"" didn't do squat here. Your ""friend"" convinced you someone was about to attack you by acting like a goddamn lunatic. While I'm glad he's apologetic that was a really horrible thing to do to anyone, let alone someone who's been through a stalking situation. 

Please don't second guess how you're reacting to this. Your feelings are totally legitimate and understandable. You don't need to feel guilty for getting scared by something scary. You do perhaps need to revisit this friendship. Seriously who does that?"
"100% fuck this guy. 

He broke up with you specifically so he could sleep with someone else. When he was done he wants you back. 
Nope nope nope. "
Turning down the job won't help him. From anyone's point of view.

"I'm a man, and in my opinion it's a huge red flag. And you know it is, b/c you didn't ask if it was a red flag, you asked if it was a huge one.

You have interests and it's 100% normal for you to be excited to share them with others, men or women. If you know you weren't flirting, you are completely in the right."
"Look into PTSD, triggers and stuff. That sounds like that’s what happened. I get triggered when people are angry or yelling even when my logical brain tells me that no one is yelling at me and I am safe. Everyone with PTSD has different triggers. Just talk to her about it and you can find out hers and you guys can work on it together. "
"I'm super confused about how they've been dating for 5 years and have been seeing each other about once a month the *entire* time, How could you even know you can stand each other for more than a few days at a time, at that point? Spend a solid month together before you try to get engaged, at least."
"Do NOT ever do any favors for this woman again. No rides, no borrowing anything, nothing. She doesn’t deserve a single finger lifted to help her or a penny. You could possibly have a small claims case against her. You can let her know how much it costs to fix and that if she doesn’t offer to chip in, you’ll be forced to bring her to small claims court. I wonder if that threat alone will encourage her to chip in for fixing your car? But I hope you know for the future NEVER lend someone else your car. Uber and Lyft exist. 

Edit to add - now that you know her true colors, you can also let her know that you’re uncomfortable renting to someone of this character, and you will not be offering for her to renew her lease after this. "

"Dude, she has made it clear with her actions that she isn't interested in getting healthier. Don't stay in a relationship with someone you need to change to be happy with because there's no guarantee that the change you need will ever come."
"Your brother lies to his fiancee, so you have no way of knowing if he's lying to you about not cheating physically. Just thought I'd point that out.

We're it me, I'd tell her. I'd also suggest she keep it to herself and do some investigating before confronting him. Don't want him to destroy any evidence of what he's doing."
Something happened between them. Maybe once maybe more. But something happened. You cannot wish this  away. Fucking confront her ... Someone needs to start telling the truth. 
"&gt;My bf agrees with me but wants no conflict with his family so he agrees on doing it every time they ask.

This is a lifelong problem that needs a nip in the bud. Right. Now. Do not put up with a pushover who will not respect your own wishes at the expense of appeasing his family. You might be a ""great couple"" but this is the kind of attitude that ends marriages.

FWIW, I would never expect my childfree sister to spend her weekends off watching my young children, let alone her partner if she had one. That's absurd. She's your age, she should be out enjoying her youthful weekend downtime. But you've got a boyfriend problem, not a BIL/SIL problem."
"Ugh, imagine feeling emasculated by a fruit. There's no way that divorce is harder than being around that 'man'. "
"Tbh, it kinda sounds like he and the girl were dating, broke up and then he reached back out to OP...I mean, he didn’t fight for OP at all when she ended it, probably because he had the other girl. "
Why do you feel bad about her taking 30 minutes to do work on the rental she's making money on? She's not even paying you and now  she expects you to do the double free work? Buying you coasters and giving you $200 year is cheap. You are getting taken advantage of.
And who's totally happy getting a sitter when it benefits him
This is a huge overreaction on his part.
" &gt;He told me I'm not doing my job 

The job he's never there to do himself?

He doesn't get to say what you do with your fun money and unless he distrusts a particular babysitter, it's crazy to think that you can never ever ever go out unchaperoned by him or your child."
"What your wife is doing is basically the same as telling a molestation victim to spend time with their abuser because “they’ve changed”.


Your wife needs to understand that you were abused and neglected and victimized as a child. It doesn’t matter if mom has changed. What matters is that you have autonomy and you have control over your boundaries and her pressuring you to interact with your mom is basically her minimizing and not respecting your experience.


You are no longer a defenseless child. You can make any choice you want to that you feel is right for you. And that’s ok. Just because someone is related by blood doesn’t mke them worth your time. "
"Don't have sex with her if she's unwilling to respect your reasonable boundaries. It sounds like you guys may just be incompatible and if her refusal to have safe sex ends your relationship, then honestly, good riddance. "
"You need to tell your husband to take a long walk on a short gangplank.  

Never in a million years would I take that (career order) from my spouse.  You study what you want.  He knew what he was getting into.    Who died and put him in charge???

He is jealous and controlling.   Has he always controlled you?  Will he be embarrassed to have a less prestigious job than you?

RECOMMENDATION — I would rethink if this is the person you actually want to be married to.  I think you are the one who should be deciding if you want a controlling, manipulative and emotionally abusive  spouse who seems to feel totally comfortable pigeon holding your into a “typically” female medical role "
Oh Tim. Tim feels misled because he made assumptions! Does he recognize that this is 100% on him?
"I think you need to frame this as a, ""You are going to break your daughter's heart if she has to find out on her birthday that you have a new girlfriend. If you care about your relationship with your children you will tell them before we go on this trip.""

You are a far better person than I am, because if I were in your position I wouldn't be able to go with an ex and his shiny new arm candy. He's so fucking selfish, and his actions are disrespectful to you and to his children."
"Sounds like a pint-gallon problem to me.

lemme explain:

You're like a gallon jug. You have so much energy you're willing to give, but you require just as much to feel fulfilled.

Your boyfriend is a pint glass. He requires only a bit of energy to feel fulfilled, which is how much energy he would also give to you, but that much is inadequate for you.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a really difficult conflict common to relationships. It damaged a past relationship of mine. You can work around this innate issue, through communicating and making your expectations and feelings explicitly known. The fact he is dismissive of your feelings is perhaps one thing you should discuss and talk about. "
"Sounds like he was an ass last night, and it sucks to learn that your relationship started like that for him. However, not only was he drunk (meaning he may not have meant it in quite the way he said), but it sounds as if all this happened quite a while ago. In his drunken state he mightn’t have been able to articulate to you that he’s grown up and changed since then, and come to love you more than he expected. 

I’d sit down and have a chat with him. Tell him how you feel - that this hurt you and makes you feel really unvalued - and if he calls you ‘second choice’ again, you’re going to need to decide whether that’s a relationship-ender for you. But do give him a chance to try and explain, even if he did act like an ass."
Run. You should never have to dumb yourself down to appease your significant other.
"There’s zero way he’s working “24/7”. I’m sure he works very hard and his job is not easy, that’s fair, but you’re essentially a single parent 3/4 weeks each month. It’s fucking hard to clean, watch the kid, work and the rest of it, and you don’t get days off. You guys are both technically working 24/7 then. 

See if you guys can sit down and discuss it. You’re allowed to have a night off even if you get “breaks”"
"Not just grabbed but was jerking it in front of a whole room of people. And he only got up to stop it when you noticed. Girrrrrl, they aren't sneaking around, they're cheating in front of you. And he doesn't give you the basic courtesy of telling the truth when you give him the chance. I feel like he's being depicted in the description as an unwilling participant when it's clear he is willing, just slightly more cautious."
Yes make his mom come with you. 
"""I became so frustrated that I started yelling at the traffic. Even though I wasn’t yelling at my girlfriend, she became scared and didn’t talk for quite a while. I pulled over to let her know that I was only upset at the traffic and it had nothing to do with her and that I loved her and would never yell at her.""

Probably the most important step is to keep your temper in check, especially around her. What you've described here is almost certainly how her abuser acted before he started escalating -- they always say ""I'd never do this to you"" until they actually do. You need to show in actions, not words, that you won't go down the same path."
"britney hates her father, and is really really angry at how life has turned out. shes taking it out on you because thats exactly how her dad did it. britney needs a way to channel this anger. does she have friends? do sports? hobbies? how fulfilling is her life? have you asked her if theres anything shes interested in doing after school? how about a school counsellor or therapist to help her with her rage? how is her schoolwork?
i know its hard not to let her evil shit get you upset. but ignoring it is basically the only way to shut it down. shes a bully and feeds off of your reaction.

Jill is the kind of person who will suddenly realize that she has no friends or outside connections. When her baby is old enough to be in school or not need her at every waking moment, she will be hit with loneliness. I don't know if she'll try and crawl back to you or not, but just trust in this - you have every right to break up. 

You may want to try and spell this out for her first, but she's self-centred. Some stuff is excusable (such as not calling you for the birth, those things don't go according to plan). Much of it is pure self-absorbed behaviour. Cringe to that last gift grab. Gross. Pass.."
"He sounds like he's under a lot of pressure to be in med school and he's not. You don't take undergrad filler classes when you're in med school. Either way, he needs help.

"I know you guys want to help John, but you can't help somebody that doesn't *want* help. Right now all your Mom doing is enabling him by giving him money so I would encourage her to stop that immediately. Whether you guys like it or not, John is an adult and capable of making his own choices in life, even if they aren't great. Some people need to sink before they can swim, and if John doesn't have any funds right now he's going to have to learn really fast that what he's doing isn't working.  The bottom line is that John wants to be with this girl, and you can't control that. Maybe instead of approaching things by putting the blame on his girlfriend and trying to get him to end the relationship, you reach out to him to try to help him find a plan to get his life in order when he's ready. If he knows he has some kind of ally that wants to help him without trying to control his relationship, maybe he will be more open to help and he will eventually see that this girl is no good for him."
"Pick neurosurgery.

You husband would be much happier with a woman who has no aspirations other than to take care of him.  He doesn’t want an equal or a better.

&gt; too hormonal must be on my period, must be insane

Yikes, just throw the whole man out. This is a fundamentally disrespectful thing to say to a female partner. It is disrespectful to your womanhood in such a basic way, it's as if women cease to have all rational thought for 6 days of every month.. just nope!

Do you really want the rest of your life to be like pulling teeth?"
"Technically my ass...  He lied to you about actually wanting to break up, and then he lied again saying he didn’t know what he was thinking. So what if he’s “technically” not a cheater, he’s still definitively a liar and manipulator and who wants to be with a person like that??"
It's a sign of dominance in the animal kingdom. Maybe he hasn't finished evolving yet?
"&gt; Any suggestions on how to talk to him about this?

Tell him his choices are live there without Tina or you'll serve him notice that he needs to leave, pursuant to the lease (if you have one) or the appropriate amount of notice for your location.

You're being too nice about this and letting him manipulate you.  It's put up or shut up time for him.  He needs to make a choice, and if he keeps bothering you about it, give him notice to leave."
"&gt; I don't want to bring children into this world and then leave them without a father. I'm not against adopting but only with a willing partner.

You realise this would affect adopted kids just as much, right? I don't think you've thought this through very well. "
"You didn't even mention that you couldn't see the texts, but she quickly admitted to saying she's said ""I love you"" to him, guilty conscious much. If he's an old friend, and doesn't text often, why would she say she loves him? On top of that, she only deleted those messages with him? don't tell any female friends of mine I love them out of respect for my relationship. She does not seem to respect your feelings, and is shutting them down actually. If the severity of you actually leaving for a few days doesn't affect her, I don't think she cares too much about how feel, or what you want out of her.


PA:

Never to against that nagging feeling, it's there for a reason. My mother had the nagging feeling to check my fathers phone logs and found he had been cheating on her emotionally with another woman for 3 years.


Please don't let that feeling go unrecognized.

He was basically still dating his ex &amp; finally ended things
She sounds like a terrible communicator. I wonder if she’s doing FWB in hopes that you’ll take her back. 
"Exactly. If this post is real, and this Anna chick is that forward, and OP's husband isn't inviting her to grope him, then the only other explanation is that he's being sexually assaulted. Meanwhile all of his friends *and his wife* watch but don't say anything because *it'd be too awkward for the friend group*. Jesus. "
"Go.

Recognize that he is worried, validate his feelings but don't succumb to his selfishness. Your ""selfishness"" is something for you, that you want to do, that will improve your relationship with yourself. His selfishness is preventing you from doing that.

GO! Have fun. Connect with yourself. He'll get over it. And if he doesn't, that says a lot more about his love for you than your love for him."
"I agree with other posters that this is one of the worst posts I've read here. I'm really shocked someone would behave like this.

"I give pregnant people and parents of newborns a lot of slack, and SOME of this is excusable in my opinion if you think about it from the standpoint of them being overwhelmed and experiencing this stuff for the first time, which I know you have. 

But a lot of this is UTTER AND TOTAL BULLSHIT. Insisting you come to an event even when you've politely declined, demanding gifts, acting like it is 'typical' for you to not show up when you've been right there, changing the terms of what your involvement in the baby's arrival would be without even talking to you about it, ignoring major events in your life, etc. etc. etc. - she's a shitty friend. Really that's all there is to it - she's a shitty friend. 

So, if you're looking for approval to redefine the relationship, or step back, or whatever, you certainly have mine. Only you know whether, if she came out of this super baby fever selfishness, it would in fact be a healthy, fairly equal / two-way relationship. If you actually know in your heart of hearts that she's NEVER been a good friend and the baby has just put a spotlight on just how bad it is, then maybe just let it die. If you think this could be temporary, IMO it's fine to get a bit of distance but stay in contact. Ask about the baby, hang out occasionally, go to her events if you can, but don't feel obligated to play a specific 'best friend' role to someone who treats you like an afterthought."
"A decision to have kids or not is one of those issues where you are both 100% on the same page, or you are fundamentally incompatible. There’s really no in between. He doesn’t want to permanently commit to someone who may not want kids. That’s not unreasonable, just like it’s not unreasonable for you to not be certain if you want kids or not. But it means that the two of you may have a relationship-ending, fundament incompatibility. 

Doing some couple counseling, especially with someone who specializes in pre-martial issues, would be very useful here for both of you. "
"So I suffer from eczema and allergies (allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis). I find it interesting that your breakouts primarily affect your face, and not, say, your legs. This would suggest that whatever you're allergic to is at the top end of your bed. This is just a suggestion, but it's common for atopic people (those who suffer from allergy-based eczema, asthma etc) to have problems with yeast, and it's also very common for people to have minor yeast infections of their scalp, which is what I wonder whether your boyfriend has. Often there are no symptoms, although if his scalp itches, that could be a sign. At night, when you're maybe sweating and tossing/turning is the optimum time for shedding skin particles, which could be how it is introduced to your skin. I would suggest your boyfriend look into this possibility. Even if it isn't this he should be washing and fully drying his hair every night before bed, as it's very likely you are reacting to something related to his hair and/or scalp."
"You need to learn how to say no. You don't have to be polite. Just say, ""No, I don't want it,"" and keep working. You don't have to make everyone happy. Just do your job.

You're not being a drama queen, though. It's uncomfortable when a man in your workplace puts you in a situation like this. I've been through this kind of thing, too, when a guy at work would keep leaving expensive gifts at my desk despite me not wanting them. I gave them all back, but he persisted. I eventually had to tell him flat out that I wasn't interested in him, and didn't appreciate the gifts. He only left me alone after I was very blunt with him.

Please practice saying no. You will find yourself in a lot of situations like this in life if you don't put up boundaries with people."
"Hi, I'm a wedding planner. This is extremely tragic and I am so sorry to hear about this. If I were you I would get her list of vendors and contact them all to let them know what has happened and also give them your number to contact for any questions, if she doesn't have a coordinator. Also, think about the things she may have been planning to have her father do. Walk her down the aisle? Make a toast? Perhaps you can go in person in a few days to talk through those things with her. If she wants to make any changes (like maybe she wants to cut the guest list way down), help her with contacting people and making that happen. Use your resources too, I am sure other friends of yours would be happy to help if they can. I wish you the best, if I can answer any other questions for you let me know, comment or PM. 

Editing to add, usually when people have lost a close family member they will have a photo of them on a memorial table, or reserve a ceremony seat in their honor, or have a pendant of theirs on the bouquet. You can talk to her about ways to honor him. These are things to think really hard about because it is so fresh and she probably doesn't want the wedding to become very sad. If she decides to do a memorial table or reserve a seat you need to let the venue know so they can adjust the floorplan if needed."

"Yeah, it does stand out that it's suddenly a problem after a year and a half of (presumably) the same routine, which is why I wonder if you just asked her when she was in a bad mood.

"Honestly, STOP DISCUSSING THIS WITH HIM. Discussions make him think he will be able to change your mind. The answer is ""No."" and that's it. "
You can't have a great marriage again until he starts giving a damn. You need to tell him you aren't attracted to him. He needs to want to change. He needs to try and do something about his weight and his depression. Why should you want to jump his bones? He's lucky you will even do it at all! A lot of women wouldn't if they weren't attracted to their partner 
"Look, most relationships don't end over big dramatic events like cheating...they die the quiet death of a thousand moments.  Contempt and resentment are relationship killers.

You don't have to have a giant event to end a relationship.  Does it make you happier to be with him?  Do you make each other better people?  Do you have the same values and goals?  If not...stop wasting your time and cut the cord.  Nobody is getting any younger and you BOTH deserve someone you are excited to be with."

"&gt;He told me that this was my fault for driving him away when I found the messages form the other woman. He said I should have told him immediately that I was in labor when I called from the neighbor's phone rather than asking him why my calls weren't going through. He told me to get over it and move on so our child doesn't come into a broken household.

It's pretty repulsive that after giving birth to his baby *mostly alone*, after being ignored because of a fight that he caused, he ***still*** blames her for... everything??? This is not how a stable adult acts! I would be calling any friend or relative I trust to come to me and help get me the hell away from this dude asap. "

"I don't know if you are ""a complete fool."" What I do know is that this friendship your boyfriend has with this woman is inappropriate and unsustainable. That's something that goes beyond whether you should trust him.

She should not be relying on your boyfriend ""1000%."" She should not ""always need company"" and then get it from your boyfriend. She should not be cuddling with your boyfriend. This is not the role that friends, even best friends, have in your life. None of this is healthy or appropriate or good and it should be extremely obvious that as you two age, things can't possibly continue this way. And yet what you are describing is that things are escalating. Not good. You are essentially enabling this extremely dependent behavior by 'being cool' but IMO you can be cool, trust your boyfriend, *and* set some boundaries."
This girl has given you no reason to trust you and it's like she wants you to think she cheated on you tbh. Don't stay in a relationship with someone you can't trust. The grief isn't worth it for either of you.
"I gotta tell you, having a mother with PTSD half the week was hard on me and traumatized me in ways I still need therapy for at nearly 30. 

But being with my calm, stable, loving dad and stepmom the other half of the week is what made me the reasonably healthy adult I am today. 

When dad divorced my mom, he was going to ditch out and go to mexico and let her have me. But he went to a therapist who told him, ""That little girl is going to need you and you can't leave her."" And he stayed for me. I am not even biologically his.

"Agreed.

/u/smith2327 You and your husband sound like kind-hearted people, but you learned a harsh lesson that you shouldn't loan out anything that you cannot afford to lose or repair. 

Allowing someone who is not on your insurance to drive your vehicle is a bad idea in general. What if she got into an accident? You and your husband would be liable. What if she totaled your car? She would not be obligated to replace it and your insurance would not cover it either.

Your neighbor is clearly in the wrong, treated you terribly, and has no plans to own up to what she did. Best to cut ties as much as possible and stop doing any favors for her. Continuing to volunteer your time and giving rides to people you want to help is great but be more cautious when it comes to giving others unsupervised access to something important to you."

"Call the police. Right now and report him. 
And talk to you stepsister and get her on your side. United you can stop him.
That behaviour should never be tolerated, and you will have a world of support behind you.
Don't let him get away with it"
"Yes, let your brother know."
"&gt;He told me that this was my fault for driving him away when I found the messages form the other woman.

What he says is crap.  He was badmouthing you to another woman, clearly already having begun an emotional affair.   And then abandoned you right in the middle of your projected delivery window.  You are in no way to blame for his bad behavior.

&gt;I wish I could walk out, but the fact of the matter is that I can't. I can still barely walk post birth...

Get a referral for a family law specialist and get a formal separation order...he'll have to support you and your  baby while you figure out what to do next.   Do not talk to him about it, just make your plans and execute.   

&gt;I could probably get over the conversations with the other woman...

You probably couldn't and won't without a whole lot of work on your husband's part.   Work that he just doesn't want to do.   When/if he gets himself into counseling and comes back with some solid plans about how he is going to deal with his selfishness, forget about patching up your marriage; just focus on your baby and yourself.   If your mom's presence would help you do that,  let her come.  He can just deal with it."
I seriously couldn’t believe it when I read that she gave all that up for a man she’s been dating for such a short period of time. WHY?
You need to also go ahead and suggest that your wife's parents and sister immediately put your wife in an information diet. She's no longer to be trusted with information about her sister since she can't be trusted not to actively try and sabatoge an innocent gifted persons future because of her jealously.

"You’ve been impatient and unkind to her and your children over the years, you’ve pressured her into doing things sexually that she didn’t want to do. Those actions have consequences. She very well may be done. And that’s her choice to make. 

You seem to believe that because you’ve realized your mistakes and claim to regret them, you’re owed, or are entitled to, forgiveness. You’re not. 

You also seem to believe you deserve some sort of... I don’t know, prize for becoming more self-aware. You say things like “I take responsibility” but what I’m *not* hearing is, “I’m horrified when I think of the way I treated her/treated my children”. I’m just hearing “Yeah yeah, I did it, but I’m taking responsibility for it - so why can’t I just be forgiven already?!”

Think about how you really made them feel. Did you children grow up in fear of you? Has your wife been dreading what was going to set you off next for almost 2 decades? Who would want to continue living that way, especially with such a half-assed effort at improving it?

Edited to add: Um, actually I’m wrong. Not **once** do you say you regret your behavior. Just what a jerk she is for resenting it. Ugh. I’m glad she’s finally standing up for herself. I wouldn’t have put up with your shit for 18 minutes, let alone 18 years. "
He is going to wreck her birthday.  Sounds like typical kids of this age... she is excited you all will be together... because she wants you back together and she thinks this trip will force that to happen.  Dad bringing a gf and introducing her is about the worst case scenario for your daughter and not something she is probably even dreaming of.  Everything in her mind is revolving on her mom and dad getting back together.
Sounds like he did break up for that exact reason to me. Especially because he got so mad when you asked. 
"You don’t have to convince her, just live your life. From this day on, you have but a single recording that activates every time she talks about having kids: “I’m not having this conversation with you.”  Personalize it to your taste and repeat it as necessary. And stick to it. 

Not her life, not for her to comment. "
"He doesn't respect you. He knows exactly what he's doing. He's got it so that you're talking on eggshells, constantly worried about his approval, and  afraid ever express your unhappiness to him, and that's how he likes it. He's not going to change because this is the way he *wants* the relationship to be.

Of course, when you try to leave, he'll promise to change, go to counseling, anything to make you stay. Don't believe it. Promises made in those circumstances are never sincere."
"You are not out of order - either time. Being partners does not entitle her to your unwavering support if she is being unreasonable (vis a vis for you) 

She should, however, really consider her relationship with alcohol. "
"Absolutely not.. if he thought he would need a place to stay he should've asked 

""Hey it's gonna be quite late after our date can I crash on the sofa""

Not that I would let him ... but he shouldn't assume he would be allowed to stay the night on a first date"
"&gt;I'm too much, too hormonal must be on my period, must be insane. 

Right there would have been where there was no coming back for me. "
"What did you friends say when you brought up the fact that during the time period which they claimed he was cheating on you, he was in fact with you?

I understand their concern (age gap, moving in together after less than a year), but do they have direct examples of any grooming or manipulation? Why **specifically** do they think he's controlling? Why **specifically** do they think he's using you?"
"He *what now*

This is fucking WEIRD AS SHIT and I would run away.

**edit:** and u/rosephase makes a VERY good point: if he's uncomfortable with eye contact when he's upset, the onus is on *him* to turn away from you. But that's not what he does - he insists that YOU look away from HIM, while he continues to be able to look at you. Why the fuck do you have to do what he says??? That's fucked up and it's unfair, and it really seems like the start of serious hypocrisy and abuse, IMO."
"I am not trying to be mean but I feel like what you’re saying is a cop out. You are a nurse which means you make a decent salary. You can take yourself off this lease and leave or you can kick him out and maybe find another single nurse who can help you. It appears to me that he is taking advantage of you. Also, he is lying to you about stuff and the fact he has you blocked on Snapchat is a HUGE red flag. Please do yourself a favor and get away from him. He is up to no good and I get this terrible feeling he is using you. You deserve better than this girl!"
"Given the context of your workplace, my guess is Ben has an agenda. 

Don't say you are in an open relationship.  That level of personal information never needs to be discussed in the workplace and if you disclose that, my guess is you'll be the talk of the office.  I'd just say something ambiguous like:  ""I appreciate your concern, but I'd like to keep my personal life and work separate.  We are working on our relationship and I'd like to keep that private.""  

I'd try to spin this as thanks for looking out for me, but use this as a way to underscore that your personal life is **not** up for discussion at work.

&gt;Plus it's super weird to me how happy Ben seemed, giving me that news 

This sub loves to encourage everyone to reveal a cheater to their SO.  I've always found that a bit naive, considering there are plenty of relationships like yours."
"So these arguments are not about the topics. You aren’t paying attention to her in a way that is meaningful to her. The things that are no big deal to you are to her because she doesn’t feel secure in being a part of your life. She is a bad communicator and doesn’t know how to share her feelings in meaningful way so she acts like a lunatic to get her needs met. She has trust issues. You are not compassionate or kind about her arguments, but as you said you are exhausted so who can blame you? 

When you find yourself at a point of utter exhaustion with your partner something is wrong. When you can no longer have compassion for them, something is wrong. It is ok to break up."
"This whole situation is so extra. I had romantic dreams about guys I didn’t even like when I was 13. I felt infatuated for a day or two. Then went on with my life. You don’t ruin your love life over a dream when your relationship has been going swimmingly for 2 years, you haven’t thought about your ex at all during all that time, and you feel very in love with your current partner. I would say there’s probably something more going on here, but considering his age, he’s probably just being young, naive, and overly dramatic about nothing. There’s also the possibility that, considering it’s been 2 years, the infatuation stage of your relationship is coming to a close (as it does in every long-term relationship) and it’s caused him to lose interest or yearn for the high of infatuation elsewhere. Again, he’s 21, I don’t expect great things. The question is whether you want to be with someone this flighty and frankly, childish."
"So he doesn't care about how much suffering you have to endure as long as *he* gets what *he* wants.   

*This* would be a dealbreaker *for me.*  "
Men yelling is fucking scary even to women that haven’t been abused. I’d just avoid yelling altogether.  
"The issue here is not the shoes. The issue is that you spent money on a specific thing that you felt your girlfriend needed/wanted for a hobby you enjoy together. She perceived this as a gift, when it was really a utilitarian (albeit kind) gesture on your part. You feel that she has taken advantage of this kindness by keeping the money and perhaps she feels you are being cheap. 

Who is right? That doesn’t matter as much as how the situation has played out. There appear to be some communication issues and value differences in your relationship. If you explain to her that you would like the money back and she still refuses, this is a problem. If I were her, I would have handed the money back to you or found suitable/comparable shoes without question; keeping the money in this case is rude. 

So, you have to ask yourself: Are there other value/moral areas that you differ on? Are you compatible as a couple when you view something this basic so differently? Are the shoes representative of something else?  How will you negotiate differences of opinion on bigger issues? Will she tell you to stick it, or will she respect your input? 

Dating is a time to work this stuff out and find someone who is on the same page as you are. Principles and character are crucial components to compatibility. This may be a moderately expensive lesson that will be worth every penny in hindsight. "
"""Hey, BIL, it's so weird that you're fixated on my weight! You mention it every time we see each other, and it's so odd that you're that fixated on my body.""

OP, you can say this in a chipper tone of voice. I've used this ""it's so weird"" tactic with people who've made inappropriate comments to me, and it really works. First of all, you're calling what they're doing. You're labelling it strange. And it's said in a polite tone that they can't argue with."
"No one at the party noticed and no one cared.  Parties are for hanging out, meeting new people, and talking to them about shared interests.  Your old man boyfriend is weird and controlling.  "

"If it were me I would send a simple message that says something along the lines of.

""Hello, so and so. We don't know each other but I recently broke up with my significant other because I found out he was cheating on me, with your wife. I thought that you deserved to know, and I can provide proof if you would like."""
"Well done OP :) Thank you for sharing this update too, it's important for people to see that things can get better."
"&gt;t at my place and drink wine and watch a movie. This was our first time meeting up but whatever, neither of us have jobs so it was a cheap first date. 

Holy shit, this was dangerous. Never have your first meeting with someone in a private place, *least of all your home.* 

Are you new to dating? I don’t know if you realize how badly this could have gone. "

"This is the best answer, right here. Just tell them you are unavailable - because I promise this job will also mysteriously turn out to be more kids than is safe, and they'll probably stay out farrrr later than they promised. Even if they agreed to pay. "
"Maybe you could try pointing out that people who are *truly* masters of themselves don't let minor incidents from six months ago preoccupy them like this. They move the fuck on and continue living their lives. By holding onto it and obsessing over how to confront this woman, he's letting the problem dominate *him*. That would be the case even if he came up with the most amazing thing in the universe to say to this classmate of his."
"Thats what bothers me, two hours later I would have drove her to the supermarket, if the kids needed breakfast in the meantime we could spare eggs and juice, but she lied and took the car just then. The suspicious part of me thinks that she didn’t really have to go shopping. Who knows, but it is upsetting."
"Tell Sally that your son is cheating on her and got another woman pregnant.  It's better that she find out from people who care for her and support her than find out when he doesn't come back.  She should have all of the facts so she can decide what to do going forward.  Even though she's religious, she should have all of the information in case she decides that this is too much and she can't be a parent right now.

You can't make your son do anything.  If you're paying for anything in his life, stop.  Don't pay for his phone, anything.  You can't make him stop acting like this, but you can make sure not to enable him."
"Another day, another post about a man who doesn't bathe or brush his teeth. The answer is to run away. You can't change him and he simply does not care about his hygiene."
Dude just call a catering company and tell them to drop off all of the food. It will take you 15 minutes over the phone and clearly he doesn't care about the cost. 
"Um, she’s physically abusing you. When she’s mad at you, she does something that causes you physical pain. That’s abuse.

The reason they all hate her is because of *her actions*. She caused this. 

Please break up with this horrible person who hurts you on purpose and then turns around and blames you for it. It’s not your fault. "
"&gt;We are just old friends, and you are being stupid.

They are not ""just old friends"" and your wife is in denial.  Secret communication with someone else is always a red flag in a marriage and the kind of texting you discovered is usually a symptom of an escalating emotional affair.

Your wife probably thinks that cheating only applies to sex.  She's wrong.  Fidelity is more than just love and sex, it includes establishing and maintaining emotional boundaries -- boundaries that protect ones primary relationship.    It is not controlling to expect fidelity from ones spouse.   If she thinks it is, *she* needs some counseling to understand boundaries and to get her head straight."
"&gt;if we get married we can't possibly sleep apart.

My husband just wanted to know why I started laughing.  Because after a nearly month-long trip together, we were dying to get home so we could sleep in separate beds.  So we could both actually get a decent night's sleep. We love each other, but holy mother of god, we do not share a bed well together.

His snoring has gotten really bad in the past six months - he's starting to get worked up over that (Edited to add - MEDICALLY worked up, as in doctor's appointments) - to the extent that he will wake himself up, not just me.  And on our trip, he was actually shaking the bed.  I didn't sleep through the night the whole time.

And I am not always a good sleeper - sometimes I have insomnia attacks, sometimes some chronic pain from a non-surgically reparable soft-tissue injury gets in the way.  So I pop into our guest room on a regular basis - either so I don't toss and turn so much I wake him up, or so I can do an elaborate set-up with pillows that takes the pressure off of my injuries so I can sleep.

Sometimes, health issues mess with your sleep and your partner's.  It doesn't mean the relationship is doomed, it just means you always have to make sure you have at least two bedrooms so you both can get a healthy night's sleep.  If he doesn't get that, that is a major problem.

I hope they figure out your eczema, and you feel better soon.

Edited to add - PEOPLE.  When I said my husband is getting worked up for his snoring, I didn't mean he's anxious.  I mean he's going to the doctor to start getting checked for apnea and other possibilities."
"Time to have a serious conversation with your fiancee and make it clear that she shouldn't be ignoring your needs here. ""Fiancee, I am starting to get super frustrated at the lack of physical intimacy in our relationship and it's unfair for you to ignore my needs while still having sex with your other gf. How can we solve this issue and get my needs met? Who are you planning on spending the rest of your life with? Me or her?""

Tbh tho, this whole situation sound like a shitshow and it sounds like all sorts of boundaries are getting broken on all sides here. "
"At this point, I wouldn't fault OP's husband if he thought OP has no respect for him.

My parents aren't quite that bad, but there is absolutely no way I would allow them to treat my wife like this. "
"Of COURSE he broke up with you in order to bang some other girl, and he absolutely WILL do it again.  Is that the kind of relationship you want?  Because that's what you're going to get from him."
"Everything else aside, why on Earth would you consider having children with someone who is telling you up front that he won't help care for them? 

You do know, deep down, that he's going to keep moving the goalposts. First he wants you to become a pediatrician. Then he'll want you to become part-time because he's just so busy. After that he'll say you should just locum for a few practices since nobody takes better care of your kid than you do! Once you have #2, he'll be pressuring you to be a SAHM. 

He may love you, OP, but he does not respect you. He has his life planned and wants you to fit into the slot he has marked ""Supportive Wife."" I'm sorry you've spent so many years thinking he was a good person but he's not. "
"&gt; I explained that I had never meant to come between them, and I never will.

You didn't though. A lot of people don't realize their families are toxic until they're in a relationship with someone who has more clarity on the situation, and when it lands, it lands HARD. You didn't come between them, you just set the stage for your boyfriend to accept the reality. He's going to need your support if he decides to cut them off. Do not attempt to talk him out of it and let him make the choice he needs to make. Biological family isn't everything.

Sounds like your mom has the right of it. I think the best thing you can do is make sure he knows he still has a mom--yours--who won't make demands and can offer him unconditional caring and support while he comes to terms with his family of origin. Make sure he knows that the family he has now as an adult is one he can choose and create for himself.

"Tbh the flippant drunk response is the best one. Ben's prying, he doesn't deserve a conversation or response about this. Be wary around the guy, do not play his game or engage beyond work matters. Truth is, it's none of his business and he needs to know that.

If he persists, quietly take his harassment to HR and report it. He's behaving inappropriately and deserves to be brought to task for it, but he's expecting *you* to freak out, which is why it's key to remain disengaged and uninterested. "
"""let's talk about expectations."" talk in person, hash it out. go in high, you would prefer to be able to have guests weekly, until X hour (for example, decide your ideal). and she would prefer what? her texts are unclear. making her say out loud instead of typing in a text that she really actually expects no guests - i guarantee she won't say that out loud. so you negotiate until you reach an understanding you both can live with. hashtag adulting."
"Yeah no kick his ass to the curb. He is obviously very verbally abusive, and honestly it will never get better. I’ve dated people like him before and trust me it only gets worse. I couldn’t do anything without him getting mad and yelling at me. Just leave before it gets worse. "
"You did well. It sounds like you handled a very difficult situation the best way possible.

I'm glad to hear that both your mom and his brother were actively supportive of your decision. Your mom handled this like a total boss!!

I do hope he takes this breakup to heart and leaves you alone."
Practicing intimacy of any kind while waiting for marriage seems like an exercise in learning how to associate arousal with guilt. That would take a lot to correct.
"If he took the time to throw out the condom, why didn’t he throw out the wrapper?

Homegirl gives hubby a hand job right in front of her but throwing a wrench in the friendship is where one draws the line? 😐
She has a problem with alcohol...it sounds like she really needs to not touch it if she cannot moderate her consumption to the point where she becomes physically and verbally abusive.
I think the bigger issue here is how your BF's family thinks your potential marriage won't last...

"This is sort of the nature of dating someone who has a kid. That said, I'm a huge subscriber to ""there's always two sides to every story, and the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" 

You didn't go into enough detail in to what specifically makes the ex-wife ""unhinged,"" but following my philosophy, it could be argued that she's simply taking the needs of her kids seriously. The lack of detail over what the ex-wife was upset about is suspicious, especially given the fact that your boyfriend rushed out to take care of both of them. To me, that implies that it was actually something serious, and that you may be overstepping by asking him to cut back on that kind of interaction with his ex-wife, and therefore, his child. 

You can make a few conditions, but it would be perfectly valid for him to push back, and reject some of those conditions. You can, in turn, decide how you want to proceed in the relationship. "

Tell him you’re not attracted to him anymore and if he wants you to be enthusiastic he needs to do better. You aren’t doing either of you any favors by lying to him that you’re still attracted to him.

So he takes some vacation days while you go have a break. Seems like a simple solution and something he should be more than willing to do.

"&gt;He told me that this was my fault for driving him away when I found the messages form the other woman. 

So your husband justifies  abandoning you and refusing to answer your calls during labor because you found out that he was carrying on what at the very least appears to be an affair?   

Every time I think I've read something so bad it has to be 
the very worst, someone posts about an even worse jerk.

Do not think that you have to put up with him at all.   I know it is exhausting but you *can* ignore him and make plans to get him out of the apartment in the short term and out of your life for as long as you deem necessary.  Do  not be afraid that you have no resources, get a lawyer to set interim support in motion."

"I gotta say this is one of those things that you really gotta step back and really think about it. Waiting up to 6 years for someone? Really? I can't even imagine someone saying yes to this in a not sarcastic way. Try saying this to yourself:

No way that sounded sincere in your head."

Exactly. His decision to end things with Jenna wasnt made out of respect to OP. He openly admits that he broke things off with Jenna because things get toxic and now they're cold with each other. He could had just set normal boundaries if he decision was made for OPs sake."
"&gt;I took a different tack then, and tried to talk to him about approaching the conversation in a friendly, compassionate way. 


What? No, you can't in good conscience support this. There is no reasonable way for this to happen.


""Tim, you should not approach her. I'm not going to help that happen. If you do, you will be harassing her.""


Do not soften the message. Do not change the message. Do not in any way be complicit in him doing this.

What we have here is likely your boyfriend having a crippling fear of becoming an adult. He wants to stay in school to avoid getting a full time job and having responsibilities. Also, he's 29 and mooching off his dad? Not okay. He's not going to grow up until everyone stops enabling him, I think you should consider ending this relationship.

"Are you sure you are a 'human cactus' and that he is right for you. It's just that before I meet my bf I would have considered myself that. I am introverted and can only socialise ~once a week, I didn't like being touched (e.g. Hugs from friends), and while I have good friends that I see regularly I was never that sharing in terms of emotions, struggles, etc. Once I met and feel in love with my bf I am always touching and craving his affection. I miss him after 3 days of not seeing him, if I could spend all my spare time with him I would, I want to do all the things I use to live doing alone such as hiking or going to the beach, with him. Finally I am extremely emotional about him and around him. Is this your first relationship or have you also been this distant to other partners? "
She's manipulating and abusive. I'd try to get proof of what she's planning on doing. Maybe get her to say it again and record the conversation. That's honestly disgusting what she's doing. I remember watching a video of a girl hitting herself so she could blame it on her boyfriend and tell people that he physically abused her. Luckily it was caught on camera.
"Can you tell him that pregnancy is physically traumatic and you really don’t want to go through it again? Pain in your back, pain in your knees, pain while breastfeeding. Hope he puts your welfare above all else. 

That mainly. And with all other reasons of physical exhaustion of looking after a baby again on top of 4 other kids, etc. 

You should focus on how it affects you. If you bring up finances, he may shut you off because he’ll just say he’ll work harder or be upset that you don’t think he’s capable of supporting the family. "
"Oh man talk to him and see about exchanging it ASAP. My boyfriend and his mom chipped in and got me a keyboard for my birthday (I love piano but don’t get to practice much since I left home and college) but it’s an annoying height and doesn’t have a damper pedal (which pretty much all classical music necessitates) and I am sick of looking at it every day in my already-cramped room and not using it. It woulda been easier to exchange if I’d just told him earlier, and now it’s been like half a year."
I think you should go.  He sounds jealous and controlling.  This is for your career...it's not a pleasure trip.
"Take the job. You need to start your career, you need to be in the best position possible.

  You both benefit from you being well employed.

 If he takes this as an opportunity to figure out what he isn't presenting well, and work on his application skills, good.  If instead he takes his frustration out on you, you may need to re-evaluate the relationship.

 There are  advantages to partners working at different companies.  Not competing for opportunities against each other, having different experiences, and most of all, if a company or project fails, one of you would still be employed while the other is on a job search."
"I’m so sorry, OP. 

I agree, a one-time mistake would still hurt but be easier to forgive. He was telling her he missed her and anticipating the next time he could fuck her. I’d personally be out of there, but this is your life. Take some time to think about it. "
"Also there no such thing as ""acting like a perfect dad"" to make up for what he did.

Being a good dad is baseline behavior. Saying ""I'm being a great dad!"" isn't something you get cookies for. "
"Yeah.. people get angry, deflect and shout when they get caught red-handed but aren't prepared to admit what they've done wrong.  And what he did to you was very wrong, OP.  And the fact that he says you have no right to be upset?? Wrong in so many ways.  Sorry but he threw your relationship away for a fling!"
"Accepting an engagement is not marriage, it's a promise to marry in the future.

If he claims he wants to marry you in a few years anyway there is literally no reason why he would have to crush you by rejecting your proposal unless he's not actually serious about marrying you to begin with. I would move.on, if you want marriage this is not the guy. He's almost 30 and has been with you for 5 years and is still playing these games? Girl, you are worth more than this, go and find it."
"All of his criticisms have a common theme - he's ""negging"" you. He's trying to make you feel bad. Anything that you enjoy (hobbies, family), that makes you excited or happy (internship), that shows your diligence (thoroughly-written ad for roommate), that is evidence that you're intelligent (using words he doesn't understand) or friendly (talking to taxi drivers) - he shits all over it. He wants you to hide your light under a bushel so no one else can see it. A true partner knows that your light doesn't take away from his - that you shine together. But he doesn't want you to ""shine,"" or even to glow just a little bit. 

And even if all that wasn't true, you ARE incompatible. Sometimes recognizing an incompatibility isn't enough. If your starting positions are too far apart, there is no compromise that leaves you both fulfilled in the relationship, and it sounds like your communication styles are too different for you to ever resolve your difficulties."
"I don't think he actually exaggerated. It sounds more like he just said that to get you to drop it. So glad someone called the police though. These days, it's no joke when someone makes a threat like that. "
"&gt; Also, he's afraid of getting water in his ear because he has a growth near his drum which needs to be removed. I think this is a very valid fear but he hasn't done anything to pursue getting it removed. I've been supporting and encouraging the removal for about a year now.

A YEAR?! Okay, sorry, that's not a valid reason, it's just an excuse. Besides, what does his ear growth have to do with not brushing his teeth? Unless he's got a really strange method, the brush doesn't go into his ear canal. 

His lack of hygiene doesn't have anything to do with his growth, he's just gross and lazy. I'd tell him that either he starts brushing his teeth and showering daily, or I'm gone. I honestly do not understand why you are enduring infections out of tolerance for his filth. "
"I think the time for being ""nice"" has passed, you need to be clear and direct.

* You are a partner, not a mind reader. Problems do not get solved amicably if they are not articulated and discussed.

* When problems are not solved amicably, they are not solved - they have merely been shoved into a corner.

* Eventually there will be no more corners and no way to just sweep things under the rug. At that point the relationship will have to end.

* You are very close to that point.

And then mean it. This is entirely his problem and if he wants the answer to remain ""that is just how I am"" then he should not be your partner.

ETA: with your edit it really just sounds like he is a bad match that is trying to keep you so busy playing games that you don't notice he's a drag.

Like, if he had flat out said that you needed to drop these two parts of your life, what would your response have been? I can't imagine you would have just freely given them up, maybe you would have compromised (like picking one, or reducing your commitment time to both) but I don't think you would have seen it as a reasonable ask and dropped everything."
"Or don't even deal with the questions. ""Hey, I know I've done a lot of free favors for you in the past, but I'm actually getting to the point where I can't handle the load anymore. I'm going to have to bow out unless we can talk about compensation."""
"You have all the answers right in front of you, and you’re ignoring every single one of them. 

You can do so much better. "
It sounds like he's made his decision on what's important to him and it's not you. Taking a break is probably wise. 
"&gt;“Actually I'd prefer if you didnt. I really need my privacy...I don't mind you having friends over but it's becoming too frequent and my apartment is not a hangout spot.”

To be fair, she never said you *can't* have friends over, just that she prefers if you didn't. It sounds like a pretty tight living space, so I can understand how her privacy feels invaded. 

How many people do you usually have over? That could also contribute to her discomfort. You're probably making more noise than you think and having people around can be stressful for an introvert. 

I would ask her for a chat and tell her that you understand that she values her privacy but that you value hosting people. Explain that you'd like to come to a compromise. Ask if there are any days that she would like you to avoid (e.g. it would drive me crazy if my roommate had people over on Sunday or Monday nights...unless it was for football). If she isn't flexible, then you have to be more firm and tell her that you are on the lease too and have every right to have friends over.  "
"I think your husband is unhappy with his job and is taking it out on you.

Traveling for work is hard, but it is completely unfair of him to say that you aren't allowed to socialize for 3/4 of the year while he is away. 

Have you guys tried marriage counseling? Has he tried looking for another job with no traveling/less traveling?"
"This is a hill worth dying on in my opinion.  If he refuses to listen to you and posts the video without your consent, that shows a complete lack of respect for you and a complete disregard for your feelings.  He's willing to put views and clicks above your feelings, what does that say about him?"
"&gt; I guess I've lived with my mom for so long, that even when she screws up and it hurts me, I just get over it after some time.

Yes, you've learned unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with your abusive mother which is why not only do you need counselling to unpack that, you need to understand that your husband doesn't have those mechanisms and that he's seeing this situation in what is probably a more ""objective"" light.  He doesn't just ""get over it"" when you do. And it's not because he's sensitive, it's because your mother trained you to accept her this way. It's not your fault for growing up that way but you might want to do something about it now.

If you don't want to lose him you do have to stop enabling your mother. 

All this stress doesn't help Bell's Palsy either. My mother had it last year but it did get better. "
"Let’s see:

- He ditches you to hang out with his friends 

- He sides with his friends when they’re crude to you

- He shared your nudes!

- He doesn’t respect you at all

If a good friend came to you and told her all of this about her boyfriend, what would you tell her to do?

Break up with this tremendous asshole. "
"I think you could avoid this being misconstrued as a guilt trip or bid for an invite by sending the gift after their wedding date comes and goes. Order it for delivery after the date with a sweet note that says you are so happy for them and wish them a long, happy life together. "

"Just leave. No matter how awful it feels to do that it's better to just rip off the bandaid than to sit there and try to reconcile. It will never be the same. You will always wonder. You will always feel shitty. Wonder if maybe it's something else you did that caused it. Sex will never be the same if you can even get that far. You'll always think about what he said to her and how he wanted her. ""I love you"" will never be comforting again. You'll never have that sense of security you once had together. Everything is a trigger. Hearing their phone go off,Seeing it's on silent,watching them put it away when you walk into a room. The urge to look doesnt really go away. If I could go back and just leave I would have. Its agonizing. Reconciliation is so,so hard. It's so painful. "
I (26M) would never do that to my gf (25F) but I’ve always tried to be respectful while in a relationship. I also have ACTUAL 3 sisters and I wouldn’t lay anywhere near any of their boobs.
"His story is absolute bullshit. 

Your question about, wouldn’t a man have measured himself prior to 35? is dead on. Am a man, can’t picture a dude using that as an excuse at 35, unless he was spouting off some shit to cover up infidelity. 

Your friend is 100% right here. I think you know it too. Dude **literally ran from you to delete evidence from his phone**, Cmon."
"&gt;I called him out on bold face lying to me and he responded “yeah I guess I did”

He blatantly lies to you with no remorse.

&gt;Over the 3 years we’ve been dating, I’ve never met any of his friends and he’s blocked me on the only social media he has

He is clearly hiding something/cheating on you. If by some small chance that's not true, he's still shutting you out of his life 

&gt;He has over 2 hour long conversations on the phone with his dads old friend

Yeah he's cheating.

&gt;I do all the cleaning, bill paying and grocery buying, laundry and dishes and he treats me like I’m a piece of shit. 

He's **using you**.

&gt;I’ve broken up with him 1000 times but he just won’t leave.

This in itself is dangerous red flag behavior. Breaking up does not need to be mutual. In fact it's often not.

&gt;but sometimes I get scared because it’s like idk who he is or who I’m living with

Scared is the key word here. Do not push that feeling away.

This man is using you, mentally abusing you and is a complete piece of shit. Being depressed or suicidal does not give you a pass to knowingly fuck around other people. And make no mistake, he knows exactly what he's doing.

**You are worth more than this. It is not your responsibility to take care of him. Get out.**"
"Has your boyfriend ever heard of the novel concept of ""keeping dumb shit to himself?"" 

I mean, for God's sake...it was a dream. I've had dreams where I fell in love with a lizard alien and another one with a potato guy with ears on top of his head who looked more like Sloth from Goonies than an actual human being. I can understand you being upset, because he is being Mr. Drama 2018 about this and somehow thinking dream feelings=real feelings. He made you question your relationship over something utterly idiotic, and yeah, I would also be disillusioned and upset about that. 

If it does turn out he's still in love with his ex (hard to believe if he hasn't actually missed her in years) then some space or even breaking up is the right thing to do. I just...I just don't even know. He sounds young and dumb and like he needs to learn about 15 life lessons really fast. The death of your relationship might unfortunately be the way it happens."
"Your girlfriend is a shitty mom. She shouldn't be laughing at her kid misbehaving. She shouldn't be threatening to call her ex or her parents to discipline the kid. She should be disciplining her!!

I couldn't stay with someone who had so little control over their kid, and didn't seem interested at all in raising a good person."
I won’t even consider hormonal birth control again because of the adjusting period going on and coming off of it. I think I cried every day for a couple of months.
It sounds like she was planning to show up with her pastor for dinner to try to convert you. 
"Literally every comment you've made is about how bad you feel, or to defend Peter. There's absolutely nothing trying to empathize with the abuse that your daughter has suffered because you didn't protect her. Do you know what it does to someone who *knows* that their home is not a safe place?"
"&gt;""I can't say I love you back because my girlfriend is here"".

Which implies if you weren't there, he'd probably say it back. Um what? You're not going to be on the trip with them. Does that mean he can do whatever he wants since you won't be there?

&gt;I feel very uncomfortable with the way she acts around my boyfrind and I don't think she respects my relationship with him. He knows I'm not comfortable with this and knew in advance that it would put a lot of strain on our trust (which has been deeply damaged in the past).

It doesn't sound like she or your BF respect your relationship. You have valid reasons for feeling uncomfortable and he's ignoring them. Their relationship sounds completely inappropriate. "
"Don't even need to read the actual post. No excuses calling your partner this. 

ok so I read it ""you have to be nasty to build people up"" Nah, fuck that. Who wants to live with someone like that in their life? "
"I think the word you're looking for is ""procrastinating"" not ""procreating"" :) but thank you for the giggle.

And yeah, this dude is not a _friend_. A prank is something that might be mildly embarrassing but you can laugh about it after. A prank should not leave a person terrified and in tears. Drop him."
"Uh yes, you should tell his fiancée."
"He's told her he knows HOW to make her happy, he just doesn't care.  If he takes a day off now, that would be confirmation--not a reason to stay.  "
"A break up isn't a negotiation, so if he's refusing to accept it or whatever, that's fine--you can break up with him and he can feel or do whatever he wants, you're still broken up.

As for not trusting yourself to go back to him, make sure you block him everywhere (EVERYWHERE) so it's harder to contact him. Have someone or a few someones to text or call when you feel weak and like you might go back. Don't try to be friends. Go cold turkey. It'll get easier."
"Technically most people return a gift without letting the other person know and so I guess pocket the refund... But it's weird to have done that with you there. I think in that scenario my partner and I would use the money on something for both of us, or an equivalent purchase, since the money was already spent. If it's the other person's money it's customary to ask them what they want to do with it, not take it yourself like it was a gift of money lol that's pretty rude..."
"&gt; I think if I proposed marriage counseling, he would decline.

When you, one partner, proposes marriage counseling, and he, the other partner, declines to attend, that means your unhappiness isn't a problem for him, that he doesn't even care enough about your unhappiness to attend a fucking one HOUR appointment. So if he declines, try re-framing his refusal in that way. 

He has a choice. He can accept you hiring an occasional babysitter to get some non-parenting time, or he can get a job that allows him to be home more, so HE can have some solo parenting time while you get ""out with friends"" time. He's framing his current job as best for the family long-term (financially, insurance), but if it's causing conflict, that's NOT best for the family. Maybe a slightly lower-paying job that allows him to parent more would be better for the family."
"I suggest that you leave him home alone with your son for a couple of days the next time he is home-take a class, make plans with friends, visit your parents, pick up hours at woke, whatever it takes so that he has to do all the child care (before and after his work hours) and chores by himself. 

He only knows parenting as a two person job, where there is someone to cover you if you need five minutes to breath, another adult to talk to, and chores are split (plus your son probably still looks to you to do a lot of the menial things first because you are the one who always does them, even if he looks to his did to do fun, special and exciting things). Being with you and his kid is his break. But raising a kid is not a break."
"No compensation? Why is this a question? Then you're not available and have a party to go to. The offer has to be better than that party. Just because you're a nanny, doesn't mean kids are entitled to your time. You are still a worker who has her own free time and if that means you're spending that counting rocks in the backyard over watching kids, then that's your choice to do so. You have a basic price as nanny, per hour or whatever. Just stick to that or slightly more as first offer. They're only going lower, not higher.

These people can stay home and look at the weddingvideo in a few months. Or look further for someone else. After a few rejections they might throw in some bounty."
"Tell the company who hired you that you are concerned that he hasn't responded to the methods your tried.  Suggest that they find another tutor for him.   In other words, get out in front of this before he blames his failure to learn on you."
Thanks now that you (accurately) put it like that it makes things a lot clearer. 
"Ok so you're the one asking for advice, therefore this advice is going to be about what you could do differently, there's no point me telling you the bad things your wife did, you know those. 

You're both ill at the moment, that sucks. It seems in this little vignette though she didn't get to use illness as an excuse to sleep in. Also you say you're a heavy sleeper and don't wake up with the kids because she keeps them quiet. Dude. No one wants the kids to be loud when they first wake up, she's not going to be like 'yay i've woken up to 3 noisy children, better let them keep being noisy in the first 5 minutes of my morning until my husband wakes up!' she's going to want quiet when she wakes up. This is your job to solve, and you know it's a problem, and your responses have been 'but my wife does X', you say you know it's not her job, but you're still kind of putting it on her as her problem/fault.

&amp;#x200B;

Next. She yelled at you from a different room because the kids were being difficult and you asked why she didn't send a kid. They were being difficult. If they were doing what she said and being chill she wouldn't have needed you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally 

&gt; A very short fight later I say something dumb like ""I wouldn't get up so early (if it were me),""  

Your solution to the problem of your children waking your wife up and you sleeping too heavily is to tell her not to wake up? You make this all her fault, a self inflicted wound. It immediately kinda dismisses her problem and while I think throwing divorce around is toxic, whatever the fight was about here you ended it by telling her everything she said was irrelevant anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think counselling is a good idea. I know people have asked about the share of duties and it sounds like you do some, only you and your wife know if the division feels fair given both of your situations. But there is this running theme through how you're phrasing it that all these problems are because of your wife - it's her fault you can't wake up because she doesn't like alarms, it's her fault for waking up, it's her fault for yelling instead of sending one of the difficult children down. It seems like either she's awful, or you're not really empathising with her reasoning behind these things and immediately problem solving for her without taking context into account. Again, it's not cool to throw divorce around and you guys should go to counselling. But feeling not listened to can break a person, being told their feelings, their reasoning are irrelevant and/or stupid and/or wrong hurts. "

"Agree with those saying family therapy is needed. All three of you play a part in this.

Also, what does your mom do when Britney says these things? If she's not punishing her, than your mom is partly to blame for this behavior. You need to talk to her about setting boundaries for both of you--she's the parent.

Also, I think you need to find ways to disengage with Britney. She doesn't like what you cook? Great, one less plate for you, she can make her own dinner, she is old enough. She has bad things to say? Then don't talk to her. If she can't talk nicely with the family, she can spend time in her room ( your mom has to enforce this). Avoid being in the same space with her when you don't have to be.

I know you want a good relationship, but you might have to settle for peaceful coexisting. Take care of yourself, don't try to be her friend, try to avoid toxic situations for both of you.

If condoms are not acceptable from her perspective, then we are at an impass and need to discuss parting ways.      

P. S., good for you for being responsible. "

"Wow, this sub is full of people who love to twist the knife.

Look, your husband was at least fantasising about cheating, and maybe/probably willing to cheat if his fantasy-girl, the one-who-might-have-been, had been receptive. That's what this is, and it's hurtful enough for what it is. OP, you have every right to be hurt, and that turns this from ""ordinary"" grief into ""complex"" grief. That means you should get some grief counselling if that is an option wherever you are - it will help give you the tools to come to terms with your husband's secrets and flaws as well as his loss.

But...that's all it is. Don't let the doom-and-gloomers here convince you he was out having serial affairs. Married, average men actually find it pretty hard to find partners. (We see posts here pretty often from couples who opened up the marriage, only to find that the women get laid and the men don't). Other than his one-who-might-have-been, there's no evidence of that, just some light flirting. It sounds to me like your man was a bit on the weak side, his attention could drift, and yeah, he could have strayed if that past flame had come back...but probably no more than that. Come to terms with the reality of it, which *is* shitty, but don't torture yourself with the worst-case scenarios. They probably didn't happen."

"&gt; He has been moderately controlling. Not in the traditional way (i.e. not allowing me to have male friends; I've always had male friends), but about finances and the way the house is etc. 

Being controlling about finances and housekeeping standards is actually VERY traditional/typical of abusers.

There are A LOT of red flags in your husband's behavior - double standards, possibly to the point of misogyny, trying to control your career, etc. At least he's doing you the favor of warning you that if you ever did have children with him, all the ""work"" of raising them will be on you, and since he ""won't allow"" them in daycare, you'll have to quit your job, so you'll conveniently be under his financial control.

"So I will say hormonal birth control made me batshit crazy. I said spiteful things, picked fights, cried over nothing, was generally insufferable and I KNEW I was.

All of this said, I never BLAMED the birth control. I chose to take it, I recognized what it was doing to me, I'd apologize, and tell people to call me out on it, and explained I was adjusting but it wasn't okay. Eventually it just wasn't worth it.   


This was exhausting to read and I'm sorry you're going through this. If she knows the BC is making her this way I'd suggest to her that she find an alternative out of concern for her health.

"Your ""friend"" acted like a jerk and then blamed you for not happily accepting it. Sounds like you're better off without her."
Of course she offered the FWB. She’s hoping you will take her back eventually. 
"They survived before they started getting your money and they'll survive without it. You aren't their personal piggybank just because you married into the family. You need to set some serious boundaries, if your wife wants to help her parents in this way then I strongly suggest separate finances. 

No is no. Don't be afraid to say no, and don't be afraid to tell your wife this is unacceptable and you don't plan on this being the norm in your married life together."
"First of all... why are you dating someone who has blocked you on social media. That’s weird... you’re not a part of his life clearly. 

Secondly, why care about someone who tries to hang out with you but blocks you on snapchat.

May he have a fruitful career in porn"

"It sounds like they have a codependent relationship. It is very unhealthy, you’re right. She needs constant validation which is concerning. She absolutely feels threatened by you. She doesn’t realize that her boy can love her and another woman and it doesn’t mean he loves one or the other any less. 

The most concerning part is his inability to stand up for you and stay stable-minded in this. It’s one thing to be in an unhealthy relationship (with his mom). But it’s another thing to be in denial about it and continuing to choose her over you. Because you should be his main concern 10/10 times, if your relationship is serious, as you say. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t love her dearly to put you first. 

I think a very serious talk with your boyfriend is in order. He needs to be on your side. Or else your wedding will be impossible. Your living together will become impossible. Figure out whether he’s willing to be on your side now. Because his relationship with his mom won’t fix itself the longer you and him are together. "
"Yeah, he's going to look majorly unstable. Even in talking to him about this, I was thinking that he seemed unstable. The only time you hold onto something minor for that long is when it's attached to some *real* deep baggage. I feel like he's just gonna unload all his insecurities onto this lady."

"I've been in individual therapy off and on for years; my mom just refuses to go for some reason, which is really weird because the only reason I still go is because my mom keeps bugging me about it. I'd never considered family therapy for the three of us, and I'm definitely going to bring that idea up to my mom. 

I'm sorry to hear you've been in a similar position, if you ever want to talk about it I'm always around."
"Can’t speak for OP, but when it was me: the initial lovey dovey portions of the relationship felt *so good*. Like everything I had been missing all my life (hint hint). And then when things start to go bad, it happens a little at a time and always because of their feeeeelings, and I don’t want to hurt their feelings, right? So I make a change. Just a little thing. No biggie. And things become lovely for a while, though I’m sort of watching for the next time he’ll explode. But he usually only gets upset when I’ve actually done something that *really* hurts him, or is unthinking or uncaring or whatever, so really it’s pretty much my fault. So I change. Then change some more. 

And eventually, my relationship ends up feeling like the household I grew up in and I figure oh. Guess this is what things are supposed to be like after all. 

That’s why. "
$1300 fix... sounds like rent just went up $100/mo this year
"&gt;You're too young to settle for someone who wants you to change.

I hate this line. There isn't an age beyond which you should be settling for assholes. Don't settle, you don't have an expiry date beyond which you no longer deserve respect and love for who you are."
"right? i'm so tired of these posts from women who date these nasty rats and then come to reddit for help. we need a sticky for something like this. ladies, if your significant other can't wash his own ass then gather whatever self-respect you have available and dump him. that is the best advice you're gonna get."
I would understand the frequency issue if it was multiple times a week but so far it has been once or twice a month.
"That was what i got stuck on, and wanted to see if anyone else mentioned it. If you adopt a child, it should because you want to be a father to that kid. The kid will grow to love and care for you. Therefore, you’re still leaving them without a father if/when you die. 

It is a red flag to me that OP sees leaving an adopted kid of any age as being much different from leaving a biological kid. I think adoption isn’t for him... "

"This is gonna sound harsh. But honestly be glad you found those texts at this point. Before you're engaged and have to call off a wedding. It sounds like he lacks boundaries and loyalty. 3 years is a long time to work at a relationship and have it daily. But a marriage with someone you don't trust is a hell you don't deserve. And you shouldn't trust him. He took her to lunch. At a restaurant you haven't been given the pleasure of going to. Honestly that's enough to walk away. Easier said than done, I know. But you're not going to change him and he's probably always jealous of who you might like or find attractive because he knows how his own mind works and expects you're tempted to be unfaithful too. Cheaters are always worried about being cheated on. "

"Its literally this easy, OP should just read her own post and see it is time to walk"
Yep. Called OP up once it was finally really over..
"It's simple. You are an emotional partner...and the other girl is a sexual partner. Either you find yourself a sexual partner of your own or find someone who will satisfy you both emotionally and sexually. Honestly, I think you should not have compromised your gut feeling for her. This relationship sounds one sided as hell."
"YES. 

OP, don’t bother trying with this guy anymore. Just tell him to fuck off for good. Then go drink a bottle of wine and exfoliate your crotch."

"Get out of there, OP."
This is ridiculously fishy. He was out until 6 am with an escort and didn’t do anything? I wouldn’t sleep with him until he’s been tested. Just sayin. 
"Also you are in your late 20s now.  Find someone else.  You can still have kids. 

Also - stop doing his homework for him - you are the brains  in this family.  Watch him and see where he ends up.  

Edited for typo "
It sounds to me like your wife is being very responsible. It isn't realistic to think that she'll be able to train a senior dog to be okay with babies when she never has been before _while also caring for a baby and recovering from pregnancy_. That's too much. Isn't it better to have a baby a few years later than to have a baby now and risk getting their face bitten off?
"Why do people believe that because you don’t have kids you don’t have other things to do? I guess working full time and running your home is such cake walk that watching kids that are not yours is no problem at all. Or because your family, you should want to watch their offspring at any moments notice. The way to approach this is to politely but asserting tell them no. "
"It means that he wants to drive a wedge between her and her family, and things always improve from there, right?"
"I totally agree with this. Texting friends often and telling them that you love them are both normal. I have a male friend that I text often, and we always tell each other I love you. It doesn’t bother my fiancé one bit, but that’s because he knows I have nothing to hide. Out of courtesy, I tell him when I talk to my friend on the phone, or when we meet for dinner. So really, it’s the lying and secrecy that are the red flags to me."
"&gt; Would I be right in cutting off all contact?

With all of your friends who have very real concerns about your relationship? If your bf does turn out to be controlling, that’s the first step in him isolating you from outside help. 

&gt; they have never actually bothered to get to know him

If they’re your age then why would they want to hang out with some near 40yo middle aged dude in their early 20s? I wouldn’t.

Abuse is much more common with massive age gaps like that. And abusers rarely start out abusive (or no-one would stay!), they’re often very charming and only turn awful when they’ve locked you in and it’s harder for you to leave (e.g. moving in, marriage, pregnancy).

The lying about the cheating thing (if you’re completely sure they *are* lying) is unacceptable, but they are right to worry.


If every single one of your friends is this worried about you, maybe you should hear them out."
"We all see you and acknowledge you.

You've told him to get out once already, so on some level you see this too.

The problem is, he doesn't see it at all. You're going to have to force him to see it. And he can either get with the program, or he can leave. Thats it, thats all. 

Because right now, where you're at, your life would be easier without him. How sad is that? A grown man with 3+ kids, and his wife's life would be easier to manage with him gone. 

So the question for you is this: are you done? or are you able to give him a chance? Thats a question only you can answer.

Before you do though, google ""The walkaway wife syndrome"" - also in case no one else has mentioned them yet also google ""You should have asked"" by Emma, and ""My wife divorced me because I left dishes in the sink"""
"Dude you are being selfish af right now. You just want to remain in your comfort zone and enjoy having her around while knowing fully well that if someone else comes along, you will leave her. And you will. Stop. "
"I assume the $200 is mostly eaten by OP's partner, because someone who can eat $45 of takeout in one sitting probably eats a lot of food."

"Your boyfriend doesn't treat you as a priority and refuses to cook like a normal capable adult?    
I'd suggest telling him he doesn't need to take the day off for your anniversary because there won't be an anniversary with the relationship over. "
"I grew up in the bible belt and have known a handful of women who had intimacy issues due to waiting. When you have it drilled into your head for your entire young adult life that sex before marriage is bad, sometimes it's hard to have a normal sex life after getting married because up until now everything you've known about sex is that it's bad and you shouldn't do it. It does take a long time to correct. Especially when you add in the fact that religious people can be wary of going to a therapist for sexual reasons (what a naughty thing!)."
"&gt;    Zane has told me about Weirdo in the past

&gt;   Apparently

&gt;   Then, according to Zane

&gt;Every single thing you have said has been what Zane has told you.

&gt;    Zane begged me not to tell my boss and begged me not to let my friends report it, and he wanted to keep it within the lab and figure it out with his PI and Lab Manager on Monday (today). He told me he didn't want to be seen as a rumor spreader.

&gt;Here's the thing, it sounds like Zane is a liar who likes to spread rumours. This gun drawing thing... he probably made it up, he went too far and he knows he's about to get caught as a liar.

&gt;Whether he is trying to sabotage the guy over a grudge or whether he just gets a kick out of it by toying with you/Weirdo, who knows.

&gt;This kind (rumour mongering) of thing isn't very uncommon in academic circles.

&gt;I would be just as wary of Zane as of this Weirdo character.

Sounds like u/ManicManicMan knew what he was talking about

--------------------------

As for what I think: You shouldve called the police yourself. You didnt have the balls to do it and you spread rumors by telling your friends. This is very sensitive information, and if you were wrong could really hurt somebody's reputation. You literally called him ""wierdo"" in the post. You should have shut up about it to your friends and called the police anonymously yourself. Instead you set up a rumor about this. 

&gt; Oh also, Weirdo is scheduled to give a research talk on campus next week, apparently. Curious to see if he ends up doing it.

I feel bad for the guy IF he was innocent. Next time dont spread rumors or gossip around with your friends. You are no better than Zane. "
"Seriously, this guy is unbelievable. I wouldn’t be able to stand 5 minutes of his behavior before I just completely bounced with my child.

I also don’t believe that the husband’s behavior doesn’t spill into their private home life, and his normal treatment of OP and their son. Which is why I *strongly urge* OP to consider divorce. Her husband is beyond toxic."
"Her quickly making up a excuse for something that you didn't even know about means that she had already rehearsed several times, just in case you ever found out. You're right, that's completely unacceptable."
Seriously OP. If I saw my significant other enjoying themselves at something I invited them to I would be happy
"Paralegal here.  Worked as a legal assistant and/or paralegal for over a decade.

I've had plenty of attorneys I supported ask me ""when are you going to law school?"" I've always been an over achiever in academics but have no interest in pursuing it forever.  I got a useless humanities degree in college.  I always tell them ""I do NOT want your job.""  I've seen how associates are treated at the big law firms, and the pressure as a partner to always be bringing in money.  It's a whole lot of constant networking to get clients.  I don't have the personality to always be selling myself like that. 


I definitely get people that look down on me bc of my job, and dating in a major metropolitan area is hard bc everyone's an over achiever and people will flat out stop talking to you when you tell them what your job is.  


I don't care.  I work my 40 hours a week and I come home and pursue my hobbies.  I don't check emails when I'm out of work.  I bought my own home about 8 years ago.  I will make over $90k this year.  Success is relative.  Not everyone is cut out to be a manager/ceo/lawyer/etc.  

And honestly, if your bf just works in tech, he might just be a programmer and that's just about the same damn thing as a worker bee paralegal at a law firm like you.  Unless he's in management or something, I don't see why he thinks your job is any less than his. 

"
Exhausting was the first word that came to mind 
"&gt; When he’s home, he wants to spend every moment having fun with us. 

That’s a luxury that people who part-time parent have. You’re a full-time parent to a child with health issues and you are also entitled to have fun, have alone time and have a job. That’s why it’s reasonable for you to hire a sitter. Maybe he should spend less time “having fun” every second he’s home and more time parenting his child, in order to understand how precious and important that alone time is. "
At the end of the day sex just isn’t that special and you aren’t special because you’re having sex with her. You’re special because she wants to be in a real relationship with you. Once you realize that it’ll be easier to “get past” her sexual history. 
"Sorry, but your child IS in a ""broken household"" already. As Dr. Phil says, ""Kids would rather be FROM a broken home than IN  a broken home."" Staying together ""for the kids"" just gives them a bad example of what marriage should be. It would be better for your kid to see that you can be independent and happy as a single person, than for your kid to grow up in a home where Dad cheats and disappears and blames Mom for it, and Mom just lets him, and Dad never takes responsibility for his actions, and/or  for you kid to be in a home where there is constant tension and anxiety and conflict, and bad behavior is never addressed, just rug-swept, living in denial. That will really fuck up your kid's radar of what ""normal"" relationships are like."

"&gt; Is my best friend trying to fuck my Husband? 

Obviously.

&gt; Why after 7 years of friendship has this started?

Who knows. People are weird.

&gt; Is my husband really just getting way to drunk to notice? Is he lying, about knowing and actually likes her sexual attention? 

The *absolute best case* scenario is that he likes the attention and hasn't made any effort to shut it down. That's pretty bad. He hasn't told her to stop Skyping him; he doesn't tell you ""Hey, Anna's being really weird"". The most he does is remove himself from the situation, and that only seems to happen when he knows you noticed. "
"Glad to hear there’s a happy ending. It definitely seemed like Jenna was trying to push you out of the picture, so I’m glad your bf came to his senses and she didn’t succeed long-term. "
"I think this is a time will tell situation. You're either going to get over it and forget this ever happened, or you're not. I don't think there's anything either of you can do to speed up the process. I can see why you're open to forgiveness, as  you say, it's  'micro cheating' probably a hair better than a cam girl but definitely not on par with regular porn.  You mention that you think he's an ethical person for willing to pay for fap materials like this but I kinda find fault with that because your BF probably doesn't know if those women are underage, or doing it out of terrible financial circumstances/no other options to make ends meet. 

I think you just give it time from here and see how your heart (and libido) reacts over the next month or so. And don't fall for gifts or favors or anything. That is not evidence that he's changed. It's only more evidence that he thinks love and sex can be bought. 

I also caution you to not put too much of your faith in words like: ""He told me today that I'm ""the one"", that he wants to marry me and said ""you're the only person I'd ever want to bring home to my parents."" Like big whoop - you know you're a good person, you know you're a good girlfriend. These words just seem manipulative at a time like this. "
Also gaslighting him by calling him stupid and controlling. Abusive.
"The hot water *absolutely* would add a tremendous amount to the bill, for what it's worth. 

"
"Technically speaking, if you’re getting a break while you’re at work, he’s vacationing 3wks out of every month while he’s away. Obviously I’m being facetious, but by his own logic, he isn’t working, he’s off having “me time”.  Which is an absurd assumption. It’s also absurd that he expects you to shoulder the burden of caring for your child 100% of the time for 3 out of every 4wks of every month, but will begrudge you a night with friends on the odd occasion. 

Honestly, it sounds like your husband is unhappy being away from home. It might be beneficial for him to also enjoy the occasional night out with friends whilst away. A better work/life balance would probably make the separation easier to handle. Best of luck. "
"That was painful to read. I sympathise with you OP.  
You need to let her go now, or this will eat you alive.  
Everytime she goes somewhere, you will wonder.  
ALL THE TIME.  
I hate to break it to you, but trust has been lost."
"You clearly have heard the age difference argument.  


I've been in a relationship where I was totally fooling myself.  It wasn't great, but for where I was in my life, I thought it was wonderful.    I had friends trying to clue me in and I would think ""meh I'm in this wonderful thing and they are just hating cause &lt;whatever excuse&gt;"".


I'd say keep an ear open to them and try to respect that they believe they are trying to help you.   If they say ""he's cheating..."" give them an entirely honest answer back of ""ok you gave me an example and I can't believe that because he was totally with me that time - why should I believe you?""    Or if they say ""he's grooming you"" counter with ""I believe you are saying this because of the age difference that is beyond YOUR comfort level, but not mine.   How do you believe I am being groomed?  What differences in me are you noticing?""


I guess bottom line is that there is a stigma about age differences in relationships - and like it or not, they are potentially going to have a bias on it.    You were born around the year 1996 and he was born around 1981 - 15 years is a very large gap for most people to wrap their head around - but aside from that, you are acting like it's their job to get to know Owen.  In any relationship I've ever been in, I worked to get to know my SO's friends (basically the other way around).   If this is as innocent as you think, and the guy is wonderful, he likely would charm the heck out of your friends right?


Stop thinking your friends are trying to ruin your relationship, but that they are speaking up on your behalf out of concern.  Either you directly squash their doubts directly or put some effort into getting Owen to make some more effort to get known.  


In this situation realize your relationship has a taboo about it that a lot of people will speculate about.  Gaining the support of your friends is only going to make this easier for you to deal with in the long run."
"""Why wont you help me anymore?""

"" because you burnt that bridge along with the clutch in the bronco."""
"You don't need to be an asshole to tell someone the truth. Why is he proud of a negative trait like that? Relationships should be build on trust, communicating, and RESPECT, which it seems he has none for you. He needs a MAJOR attitude adjustment. Seriously, you could find a very lovely person out there who doesn't demean you for using ""big"" words nor be such a verbally abusive butthead."
"Does she realize that when she IS forced to work, she's going to have a hell of a time getting hired? Any employer is going to want to know why there's a huge gap in work history, and answering ""I just didn't want to work"" ain't gonna fly. She is absolutely fucking herself over and if she doesn't turn things around soon, her only hope is going to be a sugar mama 😬 "
You got one life pursue what you want. Youll regret it later if you dont. Start looking into student loans. She very likely will eventually come around and if she doesnt well thats her mistake.
"Minister here.

You have made a mistake. Peter is acting abusively toward your daughter.  

In most cases where there is an adult child living at home who is having a conflict with a parent, I would side with the parent and say ""like it or get out"", but in this case it sounds as if Lucy is being reasonable and responsible, and Peter has a vendetta.

If I were in your shoes, this would be a dealbreaker for me.  Anyone who could treat my daughter this way at *all*, much less so undeservedly, would be out of my life.

In reference to your comment in a subthread:

&gt; I am also a religious person and I do believe, to an extent, that my husband should come first.

Nope.  

It's a regrettable thing that your first husband died, but at that moment, your primary and sole responsibility became to do what was best for your *kids*, not to find a new guy to be a part of your life.

If you knew about his derision for your daughter, you should never have stood up before the Infinite Divine and said ""This is a person I wish to bind myself to with a sacred covenant""; why would you *want* to so bind yourself to someone who treated your daughter so badly?

And if he showed no hint of this until you were married, then you have a whole *different* problem, which is that he hid his true nature until he had you bound to him.  In which case, he's a snake, and you should walk away.

Either Peter was bad before you married him, in which case you should not have married him but in any event should show him the door now; or he was hiding it, in which case you should show him the door now.

If I had been your minister and officiant, and I had known *any* of these circumstances, I would have refused to perform your ceremony.

When one marries into an established family, as Peter has, one is promising to care for the *whole* family.

He is in violation of his covenant to Lucy, and as such your own covenant to him is meaningless."
"He’s being immature and selfish, and if you’ve communicated about this and he still acts the same way, I’d say that’s a major red flag. "
"I have to disagree with everyone else on here. This bit: 

&gt; Boyfriend is in university so we only get to see each other Fridays and Saturdays. We only live about five minutes away from each other

I don't get this at all. When I was in university, I had more time to see my girlfriend than I did when I was in high school or once I graduated university. And if you live five minutes away from each other, I really, really don't get why seeing other for even a few minutes almost every day/night isn't entirely feasible. Especially since he does have time to go out to eat with other people. 

So. I agree with others that maybe you're being paranoid and controlling. And maybe whatever he's studying is one of those notoriously difficult and time-consuming subjects. But just going by what you've said, it seems to me you have some cause to be paranoid, as it doesn't seem like you're a priority for him. 
"
"I think they're more concerned that she's getting/staying attached, not you. Just be careful, a lot of times continuing to sleep with your ex while trying to date other people can really blow up."
"Men yelling is scary for most women who don't have PTSD symptoms from an abusive ex. 

Don't yell around her. Period. You can explain all you want that you love her and you wouldn't yell at her, and she probably knows that in her mind, but that doesn't mean anything to how she feels in the moment. Don't yell in anger around her about anything, ever, if you want her to really feel safe. Deal with traffic and all the other irritants of life in a different way.

There may be other things you do in anger that you will have to train yourself out of as well, but remember that this isn't about you and it isn't about logic. It's about making her feel safe with you. Because if she doesn't feel safe with you, eventually she will go feel safe without you."

"Doesn't sound like you really get a break. Maybe take a week or whatever where you start leaving the kids with him after work and taking off to friends'/family's houses until he's about ready to leave in the morning. See how he likes it and how it makes him feel.

Um, I'm not a parent though, and this might actually be terrible advice. D:"
"My now-husband had a bizarre mental block when it cane to finances when we first moved in together. He had a high paying job, he grew up well-off, and he had no debt or bills other than rent and utilities. He didnt budget. He made twice what I did but wanted to split everything 50-50 because that felt fair to him. He was living above my means. 

I hit a breaking point when he started pushing our roommate to move out because he thought we could comfortably afford to split rent 50-50. HE could comfortably afford half of the rent. He just assumed I could too.

I literally managed budgets for a non-profit at that time, so I dumped all of my numbers into a giant spreadsheet and made sure there was absolute financial transparency. I invited him to do the same. He was initially reluctant, but seeing all of mine spelled out helped. If your boyfriend wants to view both of your finances as ""our money"", then there should be no reason he won't also go for this.

When my now-husband could see clearly that me paying 50 percent of the rent for our two bedroom apartment without a third roommate would literally leave me pulling $20/month out of savings while he would have more than $1000 surplus, he ""got"" it. We instituted a plan where we pay proportionately to income - so if he makes exactly twice you make, for example, you pay 1/3 of the expenses. Add your income to his and then find what percentage of the total your income accounts for, if he wants to view both of your incomes as ""ours"". 

7 years on, we still use that spreadsheet for all of our financial decisions. We update it when expenses change, when we receive raises at work, when we move apartments or before any big financial decision. We modified it when we were saving up for the wedding, for a house, and now again for a bit of a nest egg before having kids. 

I highly recommend being as transparent as possible with finances because it might simply be that he just doesn't realize how unbalanced things are. If he can see spelled out that his discretionary spending pool is more than twice as large as yours, it might click that expecting you to cover his expensive habits isnt fair or necessary. If he's socking away $2k in savings each month, what's $45 here and there for his takeout habit? 
"
"Just break up with him. You fail to mention a single good thing about him or your relationship. He won't prioritize you, won't cook, tricks you into paying for meals when you don't cook and won't do things together with you. He's just keeping your around as a bang maid at this point. You're still so young and have so much of your life in front of you. Don't waste any more of it. Let him go back to his dog and go travel and do all the things he prevents you from doing."
"Hey there. This is a tricky situation for sure, and I totally get why you’d feel confused and overwhelmed. 

If you’d like advice from a specifically queer female perspective, I invite you to post about your situation in the /r/actuallesbians subreddit. We’re very friendly, and posts from confused and newly questioning women are very common. 

My personal perspective is that it sounds like work could become very awkward if you make a romantic move right now. 

However, you can definitely continue to be friends and try to get a feel for whether this coworker might be attracted to women (has she dated women in the past?), or specifically attracted to you. 

If you feel that she might be open to dating women, I’d try to offer her your number or otherwise indicate that you’d like to keep in touch even after your position at this school is over. After your professional association is over, you could try asking her on a date and see what she says. 

If you follow this approach, make sure that you use the word “date” and be clear that you are romantically interested. The boundary between friend interactions and romantic interactions between two women can get very blurry, and you don’t want any misunderstandings. "
"I would let know that that won't be possible.  The bill has already been paid and in fact she is late in her payment.  To have her pay less would mean every body else would owe more and they have already paid in a timely manner.  If in the future she is gone for an entire month then the household can discuss it before she leaves but at the current time, no body has had prorated utility bills this summer even though many people were gone for several days.

"Aside from what your husband thinks, it sounds like having another child will ruin you financially. I’m curious how much 4 kids has strained your marriage, psychical and mental health, and finances. Also how much you’ve both discussed financial futures lasting the next 10-20 years regarding yourselves and your children. 

Childcare is cheaper than the livelihood of a child. If you can’t afford that, and had to quit your job over it, I’m assuming you’re in debt or at least operating at a net zero. Do you have a mortgage? Car payments? A savings for emergencies and medical issues? What if this causes complications for you and you need surgery? What if the child is born disabled? 

You both need to sit down and go over ALL of the logistics of having children because it seems you’ve barely done this. He loves the cutesy baby and the fun stuff. But what about everything else? 

Forcing children to grow up in a household where both parents clearly are drained, unhappy, and broke can lead to serious mental and performance issues when they’re older. The baby and your children are their own people and regardless of how cute your husband thinks they are, if you cannot properly care for them, don’t have another. Also if he refuses to acknowledge how much this would affect you, you need to re-evaluate your relationship. "
"I’m going to say if she’s in an arranged marriage, there are big cultural reasons why this won’t have the impact you think it will."
"Sounds like you mom is a habitual line-crosser and members of your family, including you, just seem to take this as an annoying aspect of her personality instead of a trait that should be confronted and stopped.  Your husband is right to be upset and he's right about you and your family enabling your mother's behavior.  Your husband expressed his concerns to you and gave you the opportunity to confront your family members about the issues, and instead of doing that, you did nothing and allowed the behavior to continue unchecked.  So then your husband finally snapped, he had enough and it all blew up when you had plenty of opportunity to nip this in the bud before it got to this point.  You need to side with your husband on this one and set boundaries between you and you're family so that you can go back to having a healthy relationship with them."
"Oh man. My friend started dating a girl that he was absolutely smitten with. Same exact thing happened - they were in traffic, he missed an exit, he started yelling out of frustration, and that was it. She broke up with him that instant. They had only been dating a month, but she had an abusive ex, and she said she would never be in a situation again where she felt scared or threatened. 

My friend was absolutely devastated, but the fact is, after only a month of dating, he should not have let his frustrations get to the point where he erupted in anger over traffic while he was on a date with a woman. Traffic happens to all of us, and it sucks. There are 10 million things that can happen in our daily life that absolutely suck. And as adults, we have to manage our anger. I used to have a terrible temper, and when I met my husband, he made it crystal clear to me that expressing my anger in explosive ways was simply not going to be tolerated. He was right. I learned to manage and control my anger outbursts. Now, I take deep breaths, or I let out of frustrated sigh, or I'll say something, in a calm tone of voice, to express my frustration, that's not directed at my husband or anyone else. I might say that I'm annoyed, or I'm irritated, but I don't raise my voice.

"
Omg dude you need to leave. That's terrifying
"A lot of people would say: just say thank you, find somewhere to put it, and never mention it again. I actually think the truth is better in situations like this: tell him how much you love him for doing something like this to cheer you up, and how much you appreciate the time he spent on it, but that it's just not your kind of thing. After all, you don't want him to make some other huge ugly collage because he thinks you like these kind of things. You can try and soften the blow, if he's done other artistic things that you do like, by talking up how much you have loved \[insert other thing\].

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2 is to tell a half-truth. Say you love him for doing something like this to cheer you up, but that it's just too big - both in terms of physical space, but also just as an item to own. Suggest taking a picture of it, getting that framed, and put it somewhere inoffensive; then just put the original thing in a box, or a painting tube, and hide it somewhere (hopefully) that you'll never have to think about it. You're still stuck having to look at it occasionally, but at least it can be a heck of a lot smaller."
"I am kind of terrified just reading this. Don’t let him near your kid, geez. Just thinking about letting a little one near someone estranged from me at best, a complete stranger to me at worst, is setting off a bunch of red flags. Family or no, I’d only trust your child with people you intimately know. 

You said in another comment the wife called and asked for your daughter to visit on fall break—tell her you don’t feel comfortable with this arrangement due to you and your brother’s situation. She seems like she might be an understanding person. 

Take a hard stance on this. Err on the side of caution and safety. Your child depends on you. "
Just because there’s nothing inherently wrong with a person doesn’t mean the relationship is truly working.
"Sadly OP you probably can't. He grew up like this. He lacks the basic understanding that most people can't leave jobs they don't like, probably doesn't even grasp the basic concept that most people's lives are controlled to a degree by money. His life has never has been because he has always had enough. 

OP you have to sit down and think what this means for you, what does it mean for the relationship if Jason is always going to be like this. "
"You replied to another comment that he said he is looking forward to this baby. That is not the same thing as being mature enough to be a good father or a good partner to you. He is being ridiculously selfish and frankly, a bit of a jerk. *This is not going to improve after the baby is born.*

OP, he is already prioritizing his *entertainment* over the safety and well-being of you and your unborn child. No, no, no, a thousand times no. This behavior is _absolutely unacceptable_. 

You have already attempted multiple times to communicate your needs to him, and he has ignored them. It is time to decide what you want to do next. If I were you, I would be planning how to proceed without him, because he sure as a quacking duck isn't going to be a supportive partner to you or in any way reliable or responsible as a father once that baby gets here.

I am so sorry, but you can rely on this guy to do exactly one thing: be selfish. You are going to need so much more, both financially and in terms of hands-on help, very soon, and whether you stay or you leave, you won't be getting much of either from him. "

Are you leasing? Break the lease. Seriously. Or look into what you could do to get him evicted.
"Print a card and laminate it and give it to him. Then say, “fuck you” because this guy is trash. "
He doesn't have more than one day off at a time unless he uses vacation days. I've left him for a day but that's the longest we could do.
"You're not overreacting, that's absolutely disgusting. You've got to be firm, set a line in the sand, and take back your house. It's not right that you've accepted your wife's family into your home and they've seemingly crapped all over everything they possibly could. You've got to have a sit down talk, make your NEED for a sanitary living space abundantly clear. If your wife can't accept this, it's going to be really hard for you two moving forward.

I had an ex like this, house was a constant pigsty, family didn't care if food rotted on countertops or if dogs/cats pissed and shit all over the living room. Nothing changed, and the resentment it led to was one of the contributing factors to our breakup."
"I’m a little confused on your sahd status.

You both work.  You have morning duty but she does lunch and dinner. 

She does laundry so I’m assuming you do general house cleaning except for that you said you hire someone... so what are your balancing duties? 

I think you’re not giving your wife credit for her SAHM status.  

It sounds like the housework needs redistributed.  Also if your children are old enough for cartoons and cereal that is nothing wrong with Saturday or Sunday morning cartoons.   The older ones can also help around the house if they aren’t already.  

It sounds like both you and your wife are exhausted.  Sit down and come up with a better division of jobs that includes the older children.  
You may also need to clean out old toys and clothes if clutter is an issue.  "
"&gt; They just keep coming and sometimes I’m just tired or busy even though I’m right here next door.


Have you ever, you know, said no?


I mean, I'm seeing you being resentful, and seeing you begrudging the time, but... why? Seriously, why make yourself miserable?


She sounds like an appreciative and reasonable person. Just... say no dude. It's pretty ridiculous you're building up all this resentment without ever actually just saying: ""Hey, this BNB thing is taking up more time than I thought. I'm happy to stop over for emergencies, but otherwise I can't keep it up. Thanks!""


And if she texts you for a non-emergency: ""Sorry, I can't help out this time."" 


It really is that simple. "
"&gt;What the hell does this mean?

That you're dating a fucking idiot.

&gt;And how do I deal with this?

Preferably by dating someone whose ideas about gender roles and identity aren't stuck in the Reagan era.

You should see an immigration lawyer. There may be a way to stay in your current country without marrying this girl.
"My husband and I always talk about it when we think someone else is attractive. I tell him about the silver fox at work and he tells me about the co-worker who is waking the flirting line. And we tell these stories like you would to your BFF, laughing and enjoying the attention. Neither of us worry about the other cheating. We think that as soon as we STOP talking about attractive people or people who want to flirt with us, that’s where the trouble starts. When you hide it."
"Thanks this works.

The last time I saw her I told her I was planning on learning a specific recipe and she offered to help by sending me pictures of the correct ingredients I needed when she got home. We never discussed her coming to cook for me, I might not have even minded if she had asked me or offered to plan a time to come and show me how to cook it. The way she invited herself over like that stood out to me because it’s socially unacceptable (even my mom wouldn’t just text me like that declaring she’s coming to my house on a given day without asking me first or trying to arrange a time to visit)

And I’ve known this woman long enough and had enough conversations with her to know that she is perfectly aware of how socially unacceptable it is, I felt she had chosen her wording very specifically. I got bad vibes from her and was uncomfortable with the level of insistency

After the weird phone call from her pastor on Saturday night she called me to explain who he was and then insisted again over the phone that she would be “coming to my house tomorrow”

The thing is she explicitly avoiding asking my permission/asking if she could come tomorrow. I know this woman well enough by now, it felt very intentional, she was specifically trying to prevent me from being able to say “no” by making it a statement instead of a request. It felt very manipulative, like I said, bad vibes.

There have been too many red flags leading up to how creeped out I am now so either way I don’t want her coming to my house anymore."
"For me personally, I would believe him. It sounds like she assaulted him,  in which case secrecy and shame are normal reactions on his part. She also sounds crazy.

In addition, it seems like pragmatically, believing him is the better choice. If he's lieing and you believe him, the risk is that he'd cheat in the future. If he's telling the truth and you think he's lieing, your abandoning a good relationship and a husband who was assaulted. I think the second risk is worse, personally. "
"Send him pictures of what it would actually look like with an STD, and pictures of razor burn. I would just spam him, but I get petty when someone is being an idiot, so take it with a grain of salt.

And why does he think you would just openly show him you have an STD if you *were* cheating? That makes no sense."
"Honestly, if one of my kids had a nut allergy and my mom was consistently negligent regarding keeping nuts out of the house while my child was over, I'd stop bringing my kid(s) over as well.  That being said, this isn't your fight, OP."
"If you can't get out of the lease, stop buying food for him or doing his laundry at the very least. Get your money into an account he has no access to and stop paying his way for everything you're not legally obligated to pay. "
I mean she did say she was gonna do it
"&gt;My mom is now slutshaming me, telling me that she never spoke to boys when she was my age, and that if I hadn't dated so many boys there would have been no gossip to tell about me.

This isn't a Rachel/Jill problem (though they do seem awful), this is a Mom problem. Here's your script:

""Mom, we're not discussing this. I made many attempts to pay Jill back and she ignored me. She knows how to find me if she wants the money."" and then you *get up and leave*. Or you hang up the phone. The minute your mom starts in on any tangent like this, you remove yourself. 

Look up the ""grey rock technique"" and a NY Times article called ""What Shamu taught me about a happy marriage"" - it's basically about positive reinforcement in relationships. 

But dude, your *mom*. What the hell is her problem? how has your relationship with her been before this?"
"Clearly the best way to approach this is the next time you two have sex, you moan ""Oh, Justin!"" as well. 

Jokes aside, yeah, this is weird. When your partner does something in bed that makes you uncomfortable, then it's perfectly reasonable to bring it up."

"Good, he should loose his fucking job the slimey piece of shit. There's seldom a more pathetic and contemptible creature than the older guy making sexual advances or comments to a younger girl who's taken, even more so if he is also in a relationship. He deserves worse."
"I agree. I feel like a lot of people are missing the fact that the daughter is autistic. My younger brother is autistic and his childhood was a nightmare. Very, very small changes to his routine (like having breakfast later in the day) would cause him unbelievable stress. A divorce could wreck a normal child, so I think it's right that OP's boyfriend is going above and beyond in this particular case. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's just putting his daughter first in what must be an especially tough period for her."
That’s literally not the only thing he’s insecure about. I should’ve listened to my mother from the start. She always felt like there was something off about him.  
"&gt; I don’t think I’ve ever heard him complain about anything

&gt;So if his job gets to be too much he just quits and does whatever he wants

I'm really surprised you haven't seen the connection yet.  His way of complaining about something is quitting.

&gt;Like how is anyone that happy all the time?! 

&gt;He has to worry about nothing and always has a super easy job

&gt;fuck you amounts of money

I'd be happy too.  You are literally answering all your own questions."
"So take her up on the offer and don't go.  She can go on a vacation somewhere else and save a Disney trip for a time your little girl will be ECSTATIC about it.

"Try waiting until the third to fifth date to share the scary medical stuff- that’s not too soon so you get to know each other and would still happen before any talk of exclusivity. Dumping all of that on someone in the first few hours of meeting them is way too much to handle for the majority of people. It also makes you seem like you don’t have much hope for the future. Your standard move of “tell them a bunch of scary/depressing stuff at the end of the date” also ends the evening on a depressing low note- not really something that brings butterflies to someone’s stomach when thinking about a second date with you. 

Wait a few dates before telling them about your medical history/prognosis. Let them get to know you more so their decision on wether to continue the relationship is based on what they know of you as a person. The first date is way too soon for them to know you yet so they’re almost always guaranteed to think “this is too much for me to deal with” when you tell them. 

There’s a happy middle ground between “too honest and upfront to the point of scaring away dates” and “actively hiding important personal info”, you just need to figure out what that is for you. "
Ignore her. Nothing can happen from you not sending the money. 
"Eh... I’m glad you broke up with him. I’m puzzled that you got back together. That would be a no from me- too many unanswered questions, too much anxiety and insecurity, too much history of poor prioritization. He cut Jenna off but what if they start wanting to be friends again? What if he makes a new odd friendship? For your sake, I hope he really has changed, because Jenna was never the problem here- it was Jeff. Jeff and his poor boundaries. "
"Sounds like he fetishizes Latinas and is upset to know you aren’t one.

 he is this bothered about your race no longer tying in with his fetish, its a red flag glaring right at you "
"I don't know  - I come from a culture with arranged marriages, and those husbands do listen to their moms.  And their moms usually say something."
"Listen man, your friends were all super awkward because you basically said that if she gets angry, she will physically hurt you. That is some heavy shit to process, especially if a friend is bringing this up like it's not a problem. Your GF is upset because she **knows** that what she is doing is wrong but since you've never put a halt to her actions, she can get away from it.



Think about it. Did you lie to your friends about your GF? No. Did you exaggerate her actions? No. You told the truth and your GF is upset about that.


&gt;but in reality she says she only does it because I'm instigating it by shutting down and ignoring her when she's the most vulnerable. She says it's how she deals with those feelings in the heat of the moment and she knows it's not right

Dude... read carefully this part. She's not even taking responsibility for her actions. She's saying that she does that because **YOU** push her to it! That is downright manipulative and is very dangerous. She's basically saying ""You asked for it and now you have to put up with it"".


Your options:

1) If you want to try and have a healthy relationship with this woman you tell her that her pinching stops now and she needs to seek help on how to express her feelings without physically hurting you. If she refuses, your relationship should be over then and there because she won't change.


2) You leave her because you don't like how you're treated. 

Also, OP, may I suggest personal therapy? Maybe with a psychoanalyst if you can. The fact that you put up with violence from your GF for this long says something about you and standing up for yourself. You may want to work on that to improve yourself and check your self worth. You don't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does."
"I am lol at this. He’s so insecure that a banana will send him into an outraged testotornado. 
OP, your husband is trash. If divorce is not an option for whatever reason, then I’d agree with everyone else here saying to encourage him to start working more again, or forging relationships outside the household so you can concentrate on your son.

And this?
&gt;Husband started snapping his fingers in son's face telling him to wake up.

Yeah, your husband is a real asshole.


EDIT: wow, op. Your post history tells quite a bit. [Your husband is openly tormenting and mocking your disabled son.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8799kc/special_needs_son_14m_has_spontaneous_periods_of/)

&gt;I don't even know what the deal is, or what he's wanting, or really why he's doing it. My husband left for work this morning laughing about it. Last night husband woke up when I was in son's room and son was hysterically whining and sobbing, and husband told me to physically punish him for acting out

This is not ok. Since you’re also a JNMIL subscriber, I’m guessing his family isn’t any better. I strongly encourage you to look into removing yourself and your son from this vile influence. No counseling-it’s strongly recommended you do NOT attend counseling with an abuser. This is not good for you or your son."
F is not even the child of these people. Why are you all letting him dictate what happens?
"Kids aren’t a right, they’re people. You don’t force kids to live in unstable conditions because “they’re so cute that we just kept having more when they grew out of the baby phase!” 

Sorry you think having kids when you can’t financially handle them is fun and responsible. "
"That's the main problem in my opinion. I could see if he was just against sitters (for safety reasons or something), but the fact that he's fine with one when it means *he* can go do something with OP? Forget that.

OP, is he controlling in any other ways?"
"Tell your brother that you’re concerned for his friend’s safety. Show the screenshots of all the ‘im sorry’s and ask him to check in with his friend. This is not healthy behavior. I’d be really worried. (And irritated, as you’ve mentioned.)"
"If you can’t afford childcare, even if you had a job, then I’m not sure how you afford 4 kids let alone another one. 

How much do you give up in life so you can afford your children? Or are you in debt?

There is no way I see you being able to afford this many children from what you posted here so far. You have another decade+ with the kids you have now. Will you be able to financially help them through school or anything once they’re 18? What if they have medical emergencies? 

How much have you and your husband thought about future financials? Hand me downs and old cribs only save you so much money. "
"Someone who wants to be in a relationship doesnt want to ""practice being single for a year"".

“Age” not a problem to you, is it? Would you date a 52 year old man? You’re a romantic.

"I'd bet a crisp $5 bill that OP will be writing in a year about the crappy bf refusing to leave her newly purchased house and she will wring her hands and not know what to do.

Maybe your self-esteem, maybe you're a glutton for punishment, I don't know. OP had absolutely nothing good to say about her lying, manipulative, lazy bf but she just hangs her head and oh Wells the situation? "
"&gt; I feel like we need to learn to sleep in the same bed

Many couples have had significant improvements in their lives after switching to *separate* beds. Sleep is soooooo much more important than spooning. Seriously, it's a medical need.

&gt; I haven’t gotten one night of a full rest.

In addition to this affecting your health and mood, it will affect your safety. Driving tired is as bad as driving drunk.

Maybe he can get his cuddle fix some other way or time, but your sleep is more important than his spooning."
"&gt;Is this something worth working on?

Absolutely not. Your boyfriend is 30 and acts like an immature, asshole teenager. He is a bully and he is already starting to trash your confidence, 6 months in. You deserve and can get much better, don't waste anymore of your time on this asshole."
Fucking hell no you should not give him a second chance! A second chance to what? Hit you again? RUN FOR THE HILLS. 
"You can talk to her about how you’d wanted to be a bridesmaid, but I doubt that conversation will improve your overall relationship with her.  When a bride is planning a wedding, she is frequently accosted by a large number of people with various demands and opinions and judgments.  You’re going to be one of many complaining to her about the wedding and she’s probably going to react with frustration.

My guess as to why you’re not in the wedding party is that she sees you as a kid rather than as a peer.  Or maybe it is something else. Could be that she didn’t want to burden you, could be that you would be a wet blanket at the bachlorette party, could be that she kept the party small and had some good friends that she is closer to than you, could be that they didn’t want her husband’s sibling in the bridal party and excluded you too to keep his family from going nuts. There are lots of reasons that wedding decisions get made.  The fact that you’re arguing for how close you are by saying that you gave up your room for her when you were 13 leads me to think that you aren’t actually very close to her, at least not recently.  

Your relationship with her is at a changing point anyway, as you emerge as an adult.  You can choose how much energy to invest into her.  

You should completely stay out of the matter of who walks her down the aisle.  Her relationship with her parents isn’t your business and you won’t make things better for anybody by involving yourself."
"As a father. Yes and here is why, but it's complicated and ill be realistic.

So first as a parent.

1. You are 14 and she is 17. Normally 3 year age difference means nothing if both people are adults, but there is a huge difference between 14 and 17.  Like these years are massive for your development.
2. Yeah there is going to be a legal issue when she turns 18. I don't know what state you are in, but I think the lowest age of consent in the US is 16.
3. Don't throw the love world around so lightly. You just met her. You definitely like her, you are obviously infatuated with her, you'll probably remember her fondly, but love is a pretty huge word.
4. This is kinda the weird part of the story. You just met a girl and then all the sudden you two had sex. At your age sex is a pretty monumental thing and shouldn't be done so carelessly. Additionally, while sex is great it's also has very seriously consequences. For example, did you use a condom? She may have been using her own contraceptives, but she is probably not a virgin. Also did you know if she was using protection? Just saying... part of the reason why adults tell kids to wait on sex is because it's emotionally messy and it has huge potential consequences.

Be honest with yourself. Were you responsible? Or did you see your chance to have sex and went for it without much thought.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As a male speaking to a male.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, I think back when I was 14. If some hot 17 year old offered me sex there was pretty much a 100% chance I would say yes. Unless I suspected this was a trap or we didn't have any contraceptives I can't pretend I would have made any different choices then you. Also, realistically, I wouldn't listen to my  parents about whether or not I should keep having sex with her.

So here is some blunt advice. If you do continue to see her you need to understand and process a bunch of things.

&amp;#x200B;

A) Why is a 17 year old interested in you. She might find you charming and actually like you, it's also equally probable it's because you are 14 and she wanted to take your v-card. Some people really enjoy the power dynamic in sex and her interest in you may not be emotional. I read your post and you seem head over heels for this girl. Does she even feel the same way?

B) Sex makes everything more messy. People often say that you can separate out sex and emotion, but that depends on the person. It sounds like she can, but you may not. Like..... I see a scenario playing out where you basically fall head over heels and she is just like whatever it wasn't that big a deal. She moves on and you are absolutely crushed.

&amp;#x200B;

C) USE A CONDOM. The only time you stop using a condom is after you two have been together for a long enough time and both of you have been tested for STD's. Never ever sleep with anyone without a condom.

&amp;#x200B;

D) She is 17 and is going to university soon. I can't speak for her, but I don't see this ending well for your relationship. I keep hammering this point because it's painfully obvious to adults. She is going to university and she will find someone more interesting than a 14 year old. You need to understand that Disney relationships are not real.

&amp;#x200B;

E) Take it slow. If she pressures you to do X then she isn't a good person. Don't be manipulated. You are you and if someone tries to push you into something then question it.

&amp;#x200B;

F) She is just 17 Herself. She also has no idea about life and is going to be equally an idiot like you.

&amp;#x200B;

G) Don't focus all your attention on her. Your primary responsibility is school and developing yourself. If she is demanding your attention and your grades drop then you fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, there is so much to write and I don't want to throw a wall of text at you.

"It's so nice of you to do this for your brother. It's incredibly shitty of your father to exclude him from this vacation. I'm curious, have you talked to him about this?  Does he realize what that will be like for his son to be left out? I can't believe someone would leave their own kids out, it makes me incredibly sad.

Your boyfriend is being childish. If I were you, I'd have words with him about this that he wouldn't like.

 Kudos to you for thinking about your brother.

"Your dynamic is unhealthy right now. Someone's partner should not be their diet coach. I know you say that you don't want to overdo it, but you're already overdoing it. If she's not participating in your diet plan of her own accord, then trying to pressure her into it isn't okay, even if your intentions are good. 

You can encourage her to see a nutritionalist or an intuitive eating coach about making a plan that actually works for her, but ultimately she's an adult and can make her own decisions. You just need to decide whether you want to stay in a relationship with her if she keeps making decisions you don't approve of. "
It’s really hard to recognize these kind of boundaries. It takes a lot of awareness of self and surrender of control. One of my hardest lessons has been that I can only be in charge of what I do and how I feel/act and I can’t make anyone else’s decisions but my own. I admire you for working on that! And glad things are better!

"
Simple &amp; straight to the point. I like this comment 
"Your family is setting up a false dichotomy where you either have to defend his decision as if it were your own or disown him. In reality, of course, you don't have to do either of these things. There's a tactic brought up a lot on this sub called grey-rocking. Basically, it just means you have to become as boring as a grey rock so they lose interest in pestering you. Don't try to argue with them or defend him. No matter what they say, reply with the same neutral phrase. ""I love my brother and this was his decision,"" or something to that effect. Don't accept this emotional burden they're heaping on you--it sounds exhausting."

"Hmm. Is every time you offer things it’s about practicalities (tax breaks, finance etc) or do you see yourself with him forever because you love him, and want to build something (a life) together ?

Objectively it sounds to me like there’s a lot going  on but if I guessed - he’s happy to stay as things are til school ends and then he’s going to re-evaluate everything including your relationship.

A rejected proposal would ruin most relationships unless there is real communication and understanding about why the no. It can’t be “in 4 years let’s see” it should be “I love you so much but I want to do x, y, z but in 4 years I am there and committed and I see this happening when we get married” etc. If it’s all vague “let’s discuss it later” I feel like there is a break up coming.

"You're setting yourself on fire to keep him warm. Blocked you on his SC but he has dick pics on his camera? Has secretive phone convos outside? He's cheating. While using you to take care of him.

You don't need him, he needs you and he can't even be decently grateful. I get that you care about his depression and other problems but he's not considering yours at all. You can't fix them for him and he doesn't seem to care about fixing them himself. Or helping you with yours. You're a woman with a good career that can support yourself. He's a millstone around your neck. "
"You seem as keen as can be about ascribing John's actions entirely to his girlfriend. Your brother is an adult and seems entirely capable of making his own decisions but apparently he's also wholly in thrall to his girlfriend? Maybe he smokes pot because he likes it? Maybe he asked her to move in? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can also understand why he left. Your family seem unduly involved in his life. I wonder whether your brother is the youngest because there seems to be a lot of coddling involved. The idea of having my parents having access to my financial records and accounts at that age is baffling. Does your brother like this? Maybe he feels stifled and let down by his parents and you for continuely meddling in his life. Does he get a lot of grief from your family for making what you consider to be the wrong decisions? The fact his girlfriend is telling you that John never asked for help makes me think your family has a habit of swooping in to rescue John, even when he doesn't necessarily want that (like your mum busting into his house and telling his girlfriend she has to move out in a week).

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, if you love your brother you'd do best to show him support as much as you can, rather than worrying about what he might get up to. He's 20 and no doubt wants some independence and freedom - this includes the freedom to make mistakes and to learn from them. This is so important and maybe your brother feels like to get this he has to put some distance from you all? 

&amp;#x200B;

I urge you to do some self-reflection because maybe you need to consider whether your and your family's actions have actually driven your brother away, despite your, no doubt, best intentions - which is where the hurt comes from, perhaps? Unfortunately intent is not magic and your brother expressing that he needs to move away as otherwise he could kill himself strongly suggests he is deeply dissatisfied with his current life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let your brother live his life, he's a grown man and entitled to do what he wants, even if it's not what his family want. If you continue to meddle it will only drive him further away."

Don't try to explain yourself. You should own the fact that you made her the butt of the joke when you guys were already mid-argument.

Ultimately, this boils down to: 1) her comment made you feel deeply uncomfortable to the point that it created a rift in the friendship, 2) it's reasonable for you to feel uncomfortable and to feel that rift, and 3) *she's the one* who created this awkwardness, so the onus is on **her** to repair the damage. Maybe you can spend some time reflecting on whether there's anything she could do that would make you whole here. Maybe the answer is no, and that's OK and is what it is.

I agree with others, continue to block her as she pops up.

Yeah, this was going to be my recommendation, too, if divorce really isn't on the table.

I would bet half a year's salary OP's husband acts out because he's an asshole and embarassed of his son, and that his mother is guilting him into more 'family time' because she cares more about appearances (it looks bad that my son never spends time with his family) than about the fact that her son is an asshole.

I'm sorry, OP, your MIL did you a serious disservice by pressuring your husband into spending more time with you. Can you try to redirect him by encouraging him to spend his non-work time with friends or 'strengthening other family relationships'? Ie, encourage him to get some solo MIL time or to see his cousin, or even hire a caretaker for an evening here and there so that you and he can go out for some 'quality time'. That won't save *you* from his presence, but maybe he'll be slightly less of a jerk without his son there. The goal here is to leverage the fact that it is *very healthy* for married people to spend time and strengthen relationships outside of the nuclear family, and you want to rewrite his mother's ""my son is a workaholic and neglectful of his family"" story into ""my son is *so close* to his parents and his cousins, what a great man to make time for even his extended family"".

WOW. WOWOWOWOWOWOW. Does she not know you OWN the house? Does she think it's still under his parents' names? What a crazy level of entitlement to think she can confine you IN YOUR OWN HOME.

Well, since she said she'd only move in on those terms, I guess it won't be happening. It sounds like your brother is just straight up not listening to anything you say, so it's time to tell him this arrangement is no longer working and he needs to move out within 30 days.

Have you presented the issue to him in this context? Comparing this to him taking food or water away from you? He’s seeing it as doesn’t want to cuddle in bed = a rejection of him, and it should be reframed as him forcing contact during sleep = him harming you. Maybe then he’ll comprehend how serious this is.

If he refuses to allow you to sleep in peace then it’s time to consider separate rooms or at least separate beds.

See, it’s knowing that my husband has the capacity to be that angry, even if it isn’t at me. Because one day it could be. And that feeling, it just takes you back to the moment where you really weren’t sure you were gonna see the next day. It’s been 13 years. I don’t think about it most of the time. But when guys act that way, I can’t help it, the terror takes over my mind. It erases all the years in between. 

You’re allowed to be mad sometimes. But, like, regular mad. With this girl, you’re gonna have to dig deep and find an element of control. Don’t let her see you that way. She’s not going to get over this, ever, so you gotta care about her enough to know this one is on you. Don’t let her mind blend you and her abuser together. As time goes on, you may learn more about what happened to her. You might stumble upon something that will devastate her. That’s not your fault. Or hers. She doesn’t even know it’s in her head. But when those days come, let her tell you her story, and understand that this is something that will always be with her. It’ll probably get better over time, but it will never go away.

Asking you to set him up with your friend right after you've had sex is just rude. I wouldn't recommend having sex with him again, and definitely don't set him up with your friend. "
I got downvotes in another question like this because I said it was horrifying that women were proudly recommending bribing your boyfriend to take a shower with sex.... ladies please love yourselves more than this 
"Have you heard the narcissist’s prayer? It’s something like this:


That didn’t happen. And if it did, it wasn’t that bad. If it was that bad, it’s not my fault. And if it was my fault, I didn’t mean it. And if I did mean it, you deserved it."
"No include them, because you have a good chance of him ignoring it and blocking you immediately (proof, been there done that) You don't understand how some spouses REFUSE to see the truth until they have evidence. Especially if his wife is good at gaslighting. Evidence first than explanation."
"this is a girlfriend problem not a kid problem - the kid is 4 this is all normal behavior for a child of that age who gets away with whatever they want to. the mother has no authority over her own child which is why she threatens to call the kids dad or the grandparents. She doesnt want to be the bad guy so she pushes that responsibility onto other people.  

The kid continues with these negative behaviors because there are no consequences - kids will constantly eat if you let them and im thirsty is the first step in the childs guide book in being allowed to stay up late! 

 Children do attention seek when someone new is in the picture - they fear being pushed out or replaced in their mums heart because they dont understand. I imagine the elder one is dealing with this better as they have seen this before with the younger childs father. 

Basically she is a rubbish mum - she laughs when the kid is being bad which reinforces to the kid that they are doing the right thing rather than saying no. Her parenting needs to change drastically - yes it will be a couple of weeks of her having to be firm every single day whether you are there or not and enforcing boundaries and rules and following through with appropriate punishments. 

Personally I wouldnt be too hopeful that this will happen because if it was going to it already would have but if you feel that strongly about her you can discuss it with her - i would expect her not to take it too well because you arent a parent.

PLEASE use contraception that you provide yourself and dont end up as baby daddy #3 here. 

If it was me I would be running the hell away "
"Sounds like a judgemental moron with a quick temper. When people tell you who they really are, listen.

"People make child rearing decisions together? He is GONE. I’m the breadwinner in my household. My husband  doesn’t work. In my little girl’s case, she had tons of appointments and it’s hard to find a job around them. WHATEVER. If he needed a break, he’s a damn adult and deserves that. It does matter how the hell I feel if I’m not there because he is, he is a parent, and unless he’s hiring a registered sex offender, that’s his  damn prerogative. "
"You mentioned that your eczema flared up in a dirty, musty unclean work environment. I wondered if your boyfriend showering, wearing clean clothes, cleaning his sheets and investing in an air filter even may help.

However, he seems a bit self centered and in denial. Would he be willing to make those changes to save your health?"
"Because he may have given her herpes and didnt disclose so it is easier for him to just get irate with her put it ALL on her because he either didnt do the right thing,disclose, or he genuinely didnt know he had it and passed it to her.

"I just want to add that sometimes it’s hard to know what exactly will be a trigger. There are the more obvious ones like yelling or outbursts but I can get triggered by loud unexpected noises or being startled as well. It’s like any situation my body could have the slightest fight or flight response, it’s magnified and then add emotions and crying. 
I can recognize that my partner dropping a shampoo bottle in the shower and it making a loud sound isn’t actually going to hurt me but damned if I don’t have an uncontrollable physical reaction. It’s very confusing for everyone involved. 
OP, just be patient. It will take time to undo the damage but every time she gets triggered and you are calm and supportive it helps to reinforce that her body doesn’t have to go in to survival mode. "
"Rather than yelling or taking away the phone, talk to your mom about having Britney sent to her room when she can't be good company with the rest of the family. Similarly, you and your mom will have to hold you to same bar.

Right now Britney's acting out has resulted mostly in someone yelling or getting upset. That has not stopped the problem, it might have even encouraged it. So, you guys should try calm disengaging. If she complains about  something being done for her, don't get upset, just stop doing it and tell her why. If she has fits or is unkind, she can be sent to be alone in her room until she's ready to behave with others. You and your mom need to be aligned on this. But there's a good chance that once her bad behavior isnt getting rises out of the two of you and is only creating consequences for her-- she'll start changing her tune over time."
"I'm sorry but i think you also need to find a source of income...in some way to support your household. Four years is a long time for both of you to be this miserable and it won't work. Your plan is not bad, but you are making it sound guaranteed while it is not. You ar hinging a lot on the future going well i.e you graduating in four year, getting a job, and one that pays well enough for him to stop work entirely. That is a fantasy at best. Things are most likely not going to be that simple. Focus on the present a little. "
"I would talk to her husband.  Perhaps tell him what you have seen and you hear what he has seen. Maybe he would be willing to sit down with you and come up with a game plan.  

Next time call her out on her shit, even if you have to make a scene.  Tell her loudly ""Get your hands off my husband's crotch!""  ""Stop playing footsie with my husband!""

I personally suspect there is something going on here, obviously.  But if your husband isn't willing to put a stop to it, then your only choices are to put a stop to your relationship with him or call her out very publicly

Good luck!"
Those friends thst have started distancing themselves from you? Ask them directly what she's been saying and explain what she's done previously. They might not be willing to talk to you about it but their reaction should give you something to go on.
"What is wrong with asking someone if they are able to pay for their kids basic necessities? If you can barely afford 4, why have a 5th? Then the entire household suffers. Isn't it better to have a 6 person household and barely make ends meet than to have a 7 person household and suffer week to week with buying food, supplies, toiletries, etc? Tbh, I use thrift shops, what is wrong with that? Why is it an insult? "
"&gt;There are many benefits in keeping me around. I'm a great emotional support, I put out all the time (ridic. high libido), his friends like me, aside from this post, I'm reasonably communicative, and etc.

It's interesting that you put the benefits of him keeping you around, but not you keeping him around.

Personally, I wouldn't be able to just sit and wait because getting married is a big thing for me. It's like, sure he says now that in four years he'd be alright but when was he saying he'd get married before? What happens if he just keeps pushing it off?
"
"I’d walk if my husband called me that and we have an 11 month old. You’re in college, not married, don’t imagine there’s joint property involved. I’d cut it off now while it’s still easy to leave in that regard. Sorry your bf is a jackass"
"Oof. 11 is such a tumultuous time for literally anyone involved with a girl turning 11. My niece was 11 when I started living with them, is 13 now, we made it through (whoopee) but it was tough. 

Read the amazon book Little Girls Can Be Mean as well as Reviving Ophelia (should be free at a local library). It helps put a perspective on things. It helped me understand a lot. Don't let yourself believe the things she says to you. Try not to take the bait too often. Don't kick yourself if you do. 

If possible discuss it with your mom too and talk to her about it frankly without B there. Talk about the books. You will get through this come hell or high water. "
"First, I'm sorry but Tom is a trash human.  

Second, your daughter in law sounds like an amazing hardworking person. 

Usually I see this from the other end - crappy parents, kids needing to cut them off.  Honestly in this case my gut tells me that you should tell Sally that your son told you he cheated and got another woman pregnant.  If I were you I would also kick out your son and make him fend for himself.  Get a month to month rental agreement in writing from sally for $1 per month or something, and let her stay.  She's your family now.  She may want to go with her husband... or back to her family, but that's her choice.  If she stays with your son, make it clear that you won't be supporting his bad decisions anymore.  

&gt; He and my husband got into a huge argument about responsablility and he took off. He's been staying at a friends ever since. He refuses to tell Sally anything or to speak to her at all and just tells us to tell her what is going on. It's not our place to tell her. Sally is beside herself thinking that she's done something to drive him away or that he's dissapointed over the baby's gender.

Jees, have some compassion for this girl and tell her the truth, and that you think she's a great person and that you'll help her and the baby to the extent you can, and that you're not happy with the way Tom has been handling himself so irresponsibly.

You have an impressionable 14 and 16 year old still living with you.  They need to know that being a trash human will make them lose love even from doting parents.  They need a good example, and that includes being kind especially to great people like Sally, and making sure they see examples of real world consequences hitting Tom.  The 14 and 16 year olds are now your primary focus.  

&gt; Tom insisits that they used condoms

Buuuuulllll shit.  "
A lot of people are being like WELL YOU CAN HAVE FRIENDS OVER IF YOU WANT FUCK YOUR ROOM MATE and ignoring the fact that living with someone is a mutually beneficial arrangement. That's why I like this answer. Its probably one of the more reasonable solutions and OP you should try it out :) 
"You’re bringing this up way too soon. I’d find it really offputting if a guy I’d only met once not only dropped a lot of medical info on me when he didn’t know me but also told me he didn’t want kids before I’d even decided if I wanted to go on a second date. Slow down. Most people are not going to be thinking of whether they want kids with you after 2 or 3 hours in your presence. You seem to think that you’re doing a good thing because you’re being honest, and yeah, if she brings it up first then don’t lie, but you need to slow way down with this. It’s not about being manipulative, it’s about respecting social boundaries and the fact that this person is a stranger still. "
"Here's what I think is reasonable: RUN.


Seriously though. Why are you willing to give him one last chance? What possible value could he add to your life? "
"Am I crazy? Most of the responses to this seem to be telling OP she should do what she wants and her roommate can deal with it. That is not how this situation should be approached, unless you actually want to live with someone who hates you.  

First, I agree that you should be allowed to have friends over. But from what you've said, it sounds like your roommate may have been quietly frustrated for some time.  So you need to talk about it and reach a more formal agreement.  No ""every so often"" but something along the lines of ""three times a month with 24 hours' notice and not on Sundays.""

You can approach her by saying that maybe you misunderstood her position on guests and tell her what you told us, that you thought guests were fine, and that you'd like to work something out so you're both happy. Explain that hosting is important to you.  

If you take the time to talk to her about it, you'll both have a chance to make your preferences known and the best opportunity to reach a compromise.  If she is inherently unreasonable, then I think you should consider moving. "
Assume this is going to be the extent of his parenting and act accordingly. 
"So here's me. I broke up with my partner of &gt;10 years because his mental illness took a downturn and he started lying to me to cover it up, and the lies spiraled out of control and eventually it ended in a kind of spectacular reckoning. Now that I'm a couple years away from the trauma, in some ways I think that he did me a favor by crashing and burning that way. I would probably never have left him if he had just stayed low-level depressed/useless; I cared for him and after all, depression is an illness, not a character flaw.

But now I'm not spending all of my spare energy and time and money caring for him, worrying about him, cheering him up, etc, and guess what? There are a TON of really cool, fun things that I'm doing with myself instead!

My relationship was not all bad, for sure, but in aggregate it was a transfer of resources (emotional, financial, potential) from me to him, and at the end of the day, giving him everything I had wasn't enough to make him happy, but it was definitely enough to make me unhappy.

I have sympathy for people with mental illnesses and it's not their fault and it doesn't make them bad people, but you can't be healthy on someone else's behalf; they have to do it for themselves. OP, stop lighting yourself on fire to keep him warm."
"This will only end one way: badly.   
  
You saying you’ll take her back is all she needs to hear. Conditions or not, she probably figures she will wear you down to where you finally will. "
"From my experience, people come and go. The only thing you can control is your heart and your mind. Don’t waste your time consumed by the past. Love and respect yourself and accept that she does not love you. If she loved you, she would act on it. 

People spend time together and have moments that they always remember. It does not define the rest of your life. Use your mind to think about the person you want to be. The places you want to go. Don’t chase memories, don’t chase people, don’t hold on to something that will give nothing back to you. 

What you receive from your thoughts is emotional construct, tangible assimilation. What you think, you feel. What you do is based on how you think. Set yourself free. Put yourself first. Don’t chase after anyone. Live the life you have imagined and the right people will come into your life.

The more time you spend thinking of her, the more you limit your capacity to meet your own needs and desires. 

Free your mind. Fear is the mind killer. You have only so much control in this life of uncertainty. It starts when you wake up and ends when you fall asleep. What you think is everything you are. Thoughts become a realization. 

What you think is the most important thing. If you hold on to the past it will determine your future. If you learn from the past and apply that you will live a happy life.  

What are you afraid of? If you dwell on her you will miss out on someone that is right in front of you. Often times, love is found when we aren’t looking for it, when we have no expectations we are focused on our goals. The most important people in our lives are the ones we least expect to be. If you are living in a prison of your mind you will miss out on the beauty right in front of you. 

Never do something for nothing. Understand that the people who are always there for you, they are the ones that love you. Love is an action. People come and go. We make friends. We have lovers. The people who are consistently there for you, no matter how much time passes, no matter what you say or do, they will tell you the truth because they care.

It starts with you. When you wake up you have to decide to love yourself more than you loved her. You are holding on to attachment. That is not love. "
"I just want to add that maybe when OP (or if even you are) is asked about what she wants to do next, she can lay out another goal. Your aspirations in life absolutely don’t have to be career aspirations as long as you can take care of yourself! 

You could want to start a hobby or want to try something new, and it might help to make clear that you like what you are doing and don’t need it to change to be fulfilled. Just distract them from the idea that a career is all you are. "
"Trust your gut, run far far away."
Can't believe you never ended up meeting her! I'd be very curious to hear her side of things...
"YES. I am appalled that she thinks that this is a really tight knit, close group of friends that have become like family. If I ever saw one of my friends hit on the spouse of another friend even one time I would sure as hell be talking to them about it. My close friendships are “close” because I know I can talk to them about hard things. I know they will still love me and support me even when times are tough. If OP thinks the rest of the group wouldn’t rally around her immediately after finding out that her husband was cheating on her then absolutely none of these people are actually her friends. 

And I just don’t know how to process the fact that she still can stand being around a woman who JACKED OFF HER HUSBAND IN FRONT OF HER. I couldn’t ever see that person or be friends with them ever again. I wouldn’t want to socialize with them, I wouldn’t want my children to hang out with their children, I would want them out of my life permanently. 

At this point I’m sincerely hoping this post is fake, because otherwise it’s hurts my heart too much to think that OP is just accepting this behavior passively. Every human being deserves a better spouse than this and better friends than this.  All of these people are trash. "
"Spanish dude here, its not unsafe here, and he should be happy for you, what the heck."
"Just end things with her OP. Don't lead her on if you aren't interested in being with her anymore. You'll hurt her a ton more if you pretend everything is ok until homecoming and then break up right after. She's gonna realize that you were faking for a while and only stayed with her at the end for homecoming.

There is no magical ""nice"" way to break up. You just have to be direct and honest. Go as no contact as possible after you break up."
"&gt;they survived before they started getting your money...

Thanks for this. I kinda didn't see it that way until you pointed it out"
"&gt; I appreciate your concern, but I'd like to keep my personal life and work separate. ~~We are working on our relationship and I'd like to keep that private.~~

I'd suggest that's enough. Suggesting Op is working on their relationship might indicate there's an attack surface this guy can dig at. There's not. He just needs to be shut down."
"It seems like he was traumatized by your parents divorce and has a need to self sabotage. That is to say, he ruins relationships before they progress to the point where someone can put him through a traumatic divorce. 

His “checks” are a way to give him an excuse when a relationship ends: we just weren’t meant to be. If it was meant to be, i wouldn’t be attracted to others. 

In the meantime, he wont take actual ownership of his life. 

"
"You did not overreact. If anything, you're under-reacting right now. That is absolutely bananas. And I'm sorry, she has ""always"" had a one-sided rivalry with her sister for the entire seven years you've known her? So she was a 23-year-old woman trying to best a fifth grader? Imagine being that poor little girl. 

I'm glad your wife's gone to therapy about this, but I think she needs to go back, because this is some serious backsliding on whatever progress she might have made. She could have literally ruined her own sister's life. 

I hope the two of you don't have children. My honest suggestion is to get out now. And be very, very careful and take care of yourself when you do. Look at how vindictive she is towards her own kid sister, who appears to have done nothing wrong. "
It honestly sounds a bit like he hates that he doesn't get to spend a lot of time with your son and is projecting that onto you. 
"*He presents these positions and, implicitly, demands we disprove them.*

I mean. Just don't let him do this. Don't engage the discussion. Shut down political discussions. Change the subject. If he tries to do it again reiterate that you don't want to have these discussions. 

He obviously knows what he's doing and he's being a sneaky little shit by trying to pretend to be the devil's advocate. That's why you've so easily picked up on it. That's why he apologized to you, specifically, because he knows you know what's up.

Grey rock the shit out of him. When he starts on it, don't react or give him what he's looking for. Just go, ""Oh, really, this again? Don't you ever give up?"" or ""Why are you bringing this up again?"" and talk to someone else. Get up and leave. Don't engage with him, because the attention and having people treat his arguments as legitimate is exactly what he wants."
"""According to Zane"" so far everything is everyone but Zane's fault. You're talking about some guy who you know nothing about facing consequences about something you have no idea even happened, and are gossiping with a bunch of friends and still talking shit about him. 

Yeah you should have just told the police immediately, not telling a group of friends and essentially spreading a rumor. 

"
"I think this is the important thing here. Not all relationships start with everyone being the first choice, especially if you weren't exclusive. What is important though is that as the relationship progresses it doesn't continue to be ""settling"" for the next dating choice or ""just giving this a try"". My hope here is that, since you have been friends for a decade, he would care about you enough to only stay with you if you are who he wants. Maybe in a sober state he could explain that."
"There is the third option, of course: a religious guy who shares her outlook. That's who she should have been seeking after in the first place, in my opinion, could have saved both of them some grief."
"There's nothing you can do. I was John once and left home with my boyfriend at 19 and moved away for a year without any contact with my family. And, I fell on my face. John will fall on his too, pick himself back up and move on. Clearly he wants to be with her. I wouldn't really even blame her either, I don't think she's forcing him to smoke pot and run away, he is an adult making these decisions. Also, I think it's really bad texting him saying a big guy is going to go cause a scene at her family's house? Like, how is it her family's fault? Leave them alone, they can't control her. "
"Kathy is 100% wrong. YOU were in a threatening situation with a drunken, paranoid armed man and leaving was the best possible course of action. What on earth did she expect you to do by staying there?

I’d probably never hang out with him again.

“Even stuff you said?”

“Especially stuff I said.”

"I mean it sounds like she’s been cheating on you and isn’t into you at all. What has she done to show you she loves you? What were her reasons for feeling less loved? And dropping this after the affair isn’t on you, that’s her finding reasons to justify her bad behavior to herself.

Edit: spelling"
"Well, I'm not really spending any money on her now other than snacks when she's here (like if we watch a movie in between sex sessions).  The sex is incredible or there's no way I'd even consider a FWB scenario.

The fact that she values her own selfish desires (not needing to work or be productive) over her parents needing to support an adult child is a really big red flag for me so I'm not getting attached. I will enjoy the sex while it lasts, really good sex is rare.

(EDIT: I mention snacks because when we were dating she raised my grocery bill by more than 50% staying over so often, plus she eats more than I do because I'm shorter.  I can afford to feed a partner snacks and pay for half my dates, I can't afford to pay for 100% of dates and 50% of a new partner's food from the get-go.

Irrelevant and making an excuse.

&gt;I was just trying to be funny

Same again.

&gt;I didn’t mean it.

Doesn't matter, end result was the same.

Google how to make a good apology, because you're missing key parts of one. You actually saying sorry is the only bit of this which is worth having. Everything else is trying to justify yourself, explain it away, etc. Tell her you fucked up. Tell her that you shouldn't have done it. Tell her that it was a misguided attempt at a ""joke"" and you realise it was stupid and immature. Tell her you won't do it again, and acknowledge the effect that it had. Not ""you got your feelings hurt"" or anything so passive. Acknowledge the hurt you caused her, and think about why you did. 

Fine, you ""didn't mean it"" but at best you didn't bother thinking about how she might react, and at worst you didn't care, or were actively trying to make her look bad. Because you told two stories that reflected badly on her - does she find those stories funny? If not, why tell them, except because you were finding humour *at her expense*?

"She is definitely not a friend to your relationship or HIM. If she really cared and respected him she would not treat him or you this way. I think she has this weird dependency or crush on him and it’s gotten out of control. Your relationship will not turn out well unless this women is cut out from you or him or does a complete 180 and her behaviour changes (which is unlikely) . 

Your bf should never be confiding with her about your relationship . She has treated you like shit, bullied you, punished you, flirted with your bf, ignored you and overall disrespected you. If you want a future with your boyfriend YOU need to come first not her. Don’t think your breaking up this magical friendship. You need to tell him your deal breakers and someone treating his gf like this is not acceptable. If you had a guy BFF who did this to him imagine how that would go. 

I don’t think it would matter who your bf dated, that women would hate them and try and sabotage it. Don’t feel like you have to be nice to her, fuck politeness and never let her in your house and seriously sit down with your bf cause this for me would be an absolute deal breaker "
"&gt;  finally someone pulled me aside and asked me how I could be with someone that was so disrespectful. 
 
Funny, I was about to ask you the same thing.
 
And you've also said that despite therapy, this keeps happening and it just keeps getting worse. This is not a couples' issue, this is a HIM issue. The only way his behavior is ever going to change is if HE wants it to, and that means that HE would have to take the initiative to see a therapist or moderate himself without having to be prompted.
 
I live in a college football (SEC) town, so I totally get it. But I wouldn't be caught in public with someone like THAT!"
"She does laundry, I (try to) keep the house clean, we have a every other week house cleaner. I make breakfast 6/7 days of the week. she makes lunches for kids. She makes dinner 6/7 days of week.

Honestly that sounds like she's doing a lot. Laundry for five people and most of the cooking is a lot of work. 

What are you making for breakfast btw?
"
That was the other thing that really bothered me. This was the first I've heard that he doesn't want to help me take care of our kids. He intentionally painted a very different picture for a long time. I didn't sign up to be essentially a single parent. :/ And your second paragraph terrifies me as well.
"I was all prepared to defend Jill and talk about how babies are super hard and it can be really difficult to stay interesting when you literally do nothing but care for an angry potato that poops... but Jill is an ass.

Yes, it's hard to get out with an infant and I always prefer people visit me so my baby can still get her naps, etc.

Yes, it's hard to talk about anything except your baby when you don't get to do anything else and have no time for hobbies. 

Yes, late pregnancy sucks balls and it's understandable to back out of commitments because you feel like crap. 

But bailing on your bachelorette because she decided to take s honeymoon last minute?

Having two baby showers and dictating/demanding gifts for both?

Responding to texts about your big achievements with pictures of her kid?

Fuck, I'd be delighted if my old friends wanted still texted me or wanted to hang out. I'd cut off s leg to go out and have a conversation about something other than my daughter. 

Your friend is selfish and is taking you for granted. Time to cut your losses. She doesn't value you, and she frankly doesn't deserve your time."
You need to leave this toxic abusive asshole. 
"Does he realize that in formal dining arrangements, it's normal to seat men and women next to each other and nobody is pouring their own drinks or serving their own food for that matter. Maybe stuffy and old fashioned, but hardly sexist.

As far as drinking, you don't have to accept a drop of alcohol, you can hold up your glass and say ""thank's I'm already good"" or you can alternate 1 adult beverage, 1 soft drink, - for heaven's sake you're an adult, you don't need advice about how to manage your intake. I'm sure this not the first time you've been in a situation where people are drunk."
Anna and your husband are cheating together and I don't see any reason to trust either of them again. 
"This guy is just terrible. There’s nothing worse than someone who is constantly asking others to be sensitive to their emotions and never extends the same privilege to other people. 

This guy is 40 years old. Most people would be extremely concerned that a 40 year old doesn’t have 1,600 dollars. This guy is asking you to drop everything and focus on being sympathetic for something that’s entirely his fault. 

You clearly have some issues if you are tolerating this."
"If you’re a SAHD why is your wife cooking lunches (on top of dinners) and doing laundry??

This workload distribution is insane of course she’s fed up. 

Then you tell her I’ll do it if I know about it? No dude it’s literally your job to know now. Look up “You should have asked” and pull your bloody head in."
"Take pictures of bruises and secretly call the police when it’s happening. Do not threaten him. Just do it so he gets caught. You also need to tell your step mom what is happening when she is gone. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say he’s in danger of KILLING your little sister. You have to do something. 
"
"I remember doing this with my mom and the police never did anything. Even with looking at the physical evidence. Then he would punish her for it. I just don't want that to happen to them. But that does seem like the obvious way. 

EDIT: And he threatens them by saying if she (18) ever calls the police he'll ""beat her sister im front of her"". Just typing this stuff out is making me see just how horrible it really is, I can't believe I've let it get this bad. "
"I'm guessing you mean that your daughter was previously sexually abused by one of your boyfriends. So that means you think your verbally and emotionally abusive husband isn't as bad.

I really think you should see a therapist on your own."
"Get your ring back and work on being a good co-parent

I hope you took some screenshots.

edit - BTW She is emotionally cheating on you in the biggest way. "
"This. OP, I know that to you this display of anger was normal/okay, and it only scared your gf because of her history with abuse. But truthfully, yelling is always an immature and unhelpful response. Not trying to drag you, just get you to see a new perspective here. 

Being in a relationship with your gf is an opportunity for you to reassess some behaviours of your own. What she needs and deserves is to feel safe and comfortable with you while she heals, and if you care for her, learning to control your temper will go a long way. Self control is important. Roadrage is an immature emotional response that you can work on, and will not only make her more comfortable, but you a better more mature person. Make it a habit! 

Look up anger control techniques like counting backwards from 100, breathing techniques, learning to focus on something else/ distraction techniques (putting on calm music or something funny) taking a few moments to just be quiet, physical exercise, etc. Best of luck to you both. Remember that each relationship is an opportunity to grow for both partners. "
I think he's afraid that OP is going to grow a beard or something.
"And make sure you get payment before you even see the kids. If you don't get payment upfront it's possible they will withhold it later and either claim you're being greedy or act like it was a wedding gift. 

Do it before you're around the kids, else they may pressure you by acting like you're abandoning the kids."
“He’s changed a lot since then”. Ya. Now he’s just openly dating another women. 
"Nah. She doesn’t get a discount because she made plans. She lives there, she contributes to utilities. 

You wanna die on this hill, trust me. 

Next time it’ll be”I was gone two weeks. Do I have to pay rent for when I wasn’t here?”"
[deleted]
"Or more charitably - people often reflect their own preferences in what they buy as gifts for someone else. He could have just been thinking ""I'd use this chair myself"" and using that as a benchmark of his gift buying. Like if I was going to get my partner a pocketknife, I wouldnt get them one that I'd looked at and decided ""nah, I'd want better than that, I wouldnt be happy with this one""

There's plenty of room here for his judgement to have been off without him being in it just cause he wanted a better chair! 
"
"“You should really talk to him about that. I bet he’d be able to answer all your questions. All I know is that he’s still my brother and I still love him. Any other opinion I have about the matter, I plan to keep to myself.”"
"Frank is not your friend. Frank needs to be reported for property damage and you need to never speak to Frank again ever ever.

Also, Frank choosing to steal and destroy someone else's property is NOT YOUR FAULT."
"You could put a positive spin on this. You know how gross bad breath can be. This guy valued you and your relationship enough to think, ""I can live with that!"" in spite of the bad breath."
if your bf wants to babysit the kids then let him - go out do something fun - just because he agrees to something doesnt mean you have to do it too 
"Oh BTW, it is not that common, it doesn't happen to everyone and it is a big deal"
"your boyfriend is letting your mom behave this way. if he didnt like it, he would put an end to it. 

tell him you need to be the priority in your relationship. if he cant do this DO NOT MARRY HIM. i wouldnt move in with him either. hes a mamas boy. ugh. "
"Just avoid the guy and only talk to him if you need to for work reasons. It sounds like he's more pissed off that he can't vent to you anymore. If his behavior starts affecting your ability to do your job, then get your boss involved."
"“i really don’t want it-“
i think you answered your own question here.
it’s YOUR body that will be going through 9 months of pain, and you will be responsible for the child’s birth! don’t do it. 
i would hate to be the child of an unwanted pregnancy..... therapy isn’t cheap. "
He stepped away from your birthday party where you were surrounded by his family to text her. This is not a guy who deserves a second chance. He made choices that have consequences. He didn't make 1 mistake and beg for forgiveness. He made the decision to have an affair. I've cheated. I know what that decision looks like and it is a real choice. He could have stopped. He didn't. You're young. Walk away.
"&gt;To be clear, he never pressures me into sex

&gt;if I say no or make an indication that I'm not in the mood and just want to cuddle/sleep, he'll IMMEDIATELY roll over and shove me to the other side of the bed with his back.

He might not be begging or wheedling or whatever, but that's definitely him pressuring you into sex. He's making rejecting him unpleasant so that you'll stop doing it."
"Porn is forever. 

But if you want to make her feel better then tell her she can lodge complaints on the porn sites since it was uploaded without her consent. They should remove it but it’ll always pop back up. 

“I told you so” is not advisable. Haha "
"I think it's still early in the relationship, and though he's off to a bad start on keeping his word, you need to call him out on this and let him know he's not doing what he said he would do.

I highly, highly doubt those girls asked you if you wanted to wear lipstick to make fun of you. Idk if you know, but a lot of girls love gay guys. They wanted to make you feel included.

But if you continue to see him making little to no effort to accept you, then you may have no choice but to leave him."
"If my partner cheated on this level (or ever, at all) and then somehow acted like he needs counseling I would fucking laugh in his face. 

Think about what type of delusions you are under right now... he straight up proposed to another woman. You shouldn’t even care to have a conversation with him! Just say “ok yeah I’ll think about it.” .... 10 days later after no contact .... “ok I thought about it and you are the fucking worst and I don’t want to ever speak to you again, let alone stay together”

This dude spends all his time tricking women and none of it focusing on adult things like his career. He’s fucking pathetic honestly. I would never get wet again "
"Apologize for the confusion, as it seems she has misunderstood: your previous texts were not asking for permission, they were giving her notification. As per the lease, there is no maximum number for days one can have guests over. 

Or you could go the nicer route, offer up a roommate-date and talk it out. She could be going through something right now and isolating herself, she might need the push to understand that she’s invited to the living room when you bring people over. "
"You sound like his once-a-month booty call at this point. He doesn’t want you around more than that, doesn’t want to live together, doesn’t want to commit to a future together... he’s happy with the once a month thing, apparently.

But yeah like others here I would suggest maybe not proposing to a guy you’ve never lived with or actually shared your life with before - once a month isn’t enough exposure to see how you actually interact on a daily basis in the million important ways that can make and break an adult relationship. "
"Being honest means saying, ""Because you asked, that top isn't really flattering on you, I think you should go with another choice."" Or ""I think the Marvel films are overhyped"" or ""Honestly, I don't understand the reading material and need extra help."" *That's* being honest.  ""You using words that I don't understand makes me feel frustrated"" is being honest. Insulting people and calling them nasty words isn't being ""brutally honest"" and it's not a trait to be admired. It's just ""I will hurt you to make myself feel better and will play it off like it's a good thing.""

This guy isn't worthy enough to clean your shoes."
"&gt; Are we just incompatible?

That depends, do you think you're compatible with a jerk? Because that's all your boyfriend is, a garden-variety jerk.

You can certainly navigate a relationship with a jerk but why would you want to be in a relationship with someone that makes you feel judged and criticized?"
Oooh. I like that. That actually might resonate with him. I think I tried to say something like this but I didn't quite have the words. Thank you!
"If divorce is not on the table, can you ask him to go back to how it was for the past 17 years?  You said he just recently started joining the family.  Can you ask him to stop?  Are his parents in town?  I wonder if he would act like this during a dinner with them.  Would shame work at all?"
Simple. You need some space from your parents go low contact for a while. You have a hairball of other issues so get counseling to work through those. Greyrock your parents and don't lean on them for anything important.
"You're not an ass.

If I squint hard enough, it almost looks to me like he's trying to break up with you.

He's stopped having sex. He's stopped hanging out with you. He's stopped touching you. He's emotionally distancing himself from you. Now he's asking for these things to be maintained for five years. If that isn't a glacial-pace breakup, I don't know what is.

I know it's sad, it sounds like it's been a long time together. But he may have reached the end of the road."
"Wow this woman sounds terrible! You did the right thing firing her.

Side note- how big is your place? You'd be surprised how long it takes to really clean a house (if you're doing it properly and thoroughly). I'm a professional house cleaner and for a 1 bed 2 bath medium sized condo, it takes me 2-3 hours to thoroughly clean it."
"I'm thinking i might just take his camera / laptop  and delete this video today because I don't want to even get in that situation

Edit - I deleted the video off his devices and kept a copy on a thumb drive of mine just in case"
"He's a POS for even considering bringing her. He's showing no consideration for his kids at all, let alone you."
You can report it up his chain to the Navys shirt equivalent with pictures of the evidence and he could be potentially charged with adultery.
"Wow. The healthiest things that happened here are, I think, you reaching out and the gf’s parents saying “Not our problem.”

Your mom has been way out of line monitoring an adult’s spending, relationship, and household (regardless of her help in purchasing the pad). Your bro-in-law threatening strangers’ safety to manipulate your brother into calling...

John’s an adult here. Managing him is going to push him towards feeling inadequate because that’s how he’s being treated. He is being put in a position to believe anything that anyone but your family tells him just because he seems more independent in his own eyes. 

It sucks, but give him space. Check in, keep inviting him around and start respecting his crap decisions because they’re his, not because they’re good. "
He didn’t respond for a day and a half? Also what makes you think he will follow through with plans and actually come over? If he doesn’t then breaking up through text may be a thing. He doesn’t care about you and that’s clear. He comes back a day and a half later and you instantly respond don’t you? He does this because you are always waiting for him no matter what and he gets away with it. He’s crappy for doing this to begin with don’t get me wrong. But I don’t think he deserves you inviting him over for a break up because when he’s in front of your face you may chicken out. Acknowledge how you feel right now and realize he will say and do anything to keep you from dropping him because it’s inconvenient for him. You need to do whatever will keep you going through with this break up and if it’s through text then so be it because he brought it on himself. I admire you for trying to be an adult about it but he doesn’t really even deserve it. Do what it takes to break up with him. You are no less of an adult if you break up with this particular guy through text. Honest opinion. 
"Have you watched Friends? Monica and Chandler had the best relationship and marriage. It awkwardly started when the group was all on a trip, Monica was sad about something and she and Chandler ended up having sex. Down the line, she admits that it was actually Joey that she wanted to have sex with that night. Obviously this isn't the exact same situation, but it's similar.

You have to talk to him about it. He may express that while at first he was more interested in someone else, now he's glad that she rejected him and wouldn't trade you for the world."
"I hate people like that, it just makes you want to tape their mouths shut, doesn't it? And if he's telling you to shut up when you ask him to stop, that just doesn't sound very emotionally healthy to me. When he's not being like this, are you able to talk to him about it? Can you tell him it's embarrassing and inappropriate public behavior or does he react poorly to honest criticism?"
"People assuming that predators won't victimize certain people needs to stop. 

The guys is a coach for women in a *gym*. Where they wear active wear and close physical contact is often necessary. James didn't decide to be the coach without having an ulterior motive. He's not becoming less of a creep because of it."
"They probably ask what they are doing before they ask to babysit. He could answer with something like, date night or a get together with friends, even if they haven't been asked to babysit yet. They will eventually quit asking and find someone else if they are never available. "
"Definitely this. He's lying, and badly. I can't believe that's the best story he could come up with and that he actually thought you would believe it. I feel so bad for you, OP. You definitely deserve better. 
"
What the fuck dude? You need to reread your OP and your comments here. Really open your eyes and honestly admit to yourself the type of person your husband is. 
It sounds harsh but you're saying the truth. OP needs to take her love glasses off.
"I don't know if you know of the sub r/JustNoMIL , but it's got quite a lot of useful tools and what-not to help in situations like this.

Basically, there's nothing between your mother and you that would necessitate a restraining order, yet the sheer volume of annoyances and disregarding from her is giving you an anxiety attack when she contacts you. I bet if you have a read around of some of the stuff in r/JustNoMIL you'll find some like-minded people, and you'll be saying to your husband, ""Blimey! That's what MY mum does!"" (minus the British cursing, probably). These overbearing mothers/MILs seem to follow a bloody ten-step formula, it feels like.

Your mother does need boundaries and consequences, as you're seeing. Based on that last visit, one would be, ""I am the parent and I decide X about my child. One more comment about X and we won't speak for a month. That means no photos, no texts, no emails, nothing, for a month."" And don't JADE (JADE = Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain). You don't need to state *why* you don't like it. *You* are the parent, you've explained over and over until you're sick of it, so no more. Your child is not her do-over child. You're not a mini-her or her property. She's no more entitled to opinions on your child than she is about the child next door. Honestly.

Take back the control of your actions/marriage/childcare decisions from your mum - it's yours to give or keep. 

As far as your husband goes, I think you should be telling her to back off him. He's entitled to say he doesn't want her to visit until she apologises (properly), and part of me wants you to let him off the leash to verbally (politely) go at her!

Why does the thought of boundaries terrify you? What can she do to you? Most of that feeling of anxiety and terror etc is possibly learned behaviour; she taught you to feel that way (installed 'buttons' early on in your life so she could press them any time you didn't do what she wanted). 

Good luck! x"
"I was actually just now mulling over what to say and I am thinking pretty close to the same thing! Include screenshots on initial message, or only if he asks?"
"I’m so sorry that this happened OP... I feel absolutely disgusted for you. We could argue technicalities all we want, but the fact is, he put you through so much devastation without a second thought. The real question is, do you want to be with someone who puts your feelings so far below his own selfish desires? 

You don’t need to justify that you’re breaking up with him because he cheated, but this situation made his lack of care and consideration very apparent. If you take him back, my guess is that this won’t be the last time his “not cheating” happens. "
"Honestly he's either cruel or 12 different kinds of idiot. Either way, not someone you want as a friend."
"Uncross your fingers and open your mouth before she books the flight! ""We cannot host you for the holidays this year."" Period. And if she pushes quote her complaints from last year. You might be stressed imagining telling her ""no"" but imagine how stressed you will be if she arrives. "
"So, your 'friends' are racists and assume that because you dated one black person, all black people are going to come look for your friends? That's quite insane... not to mention quite narcissistic.

You need new friends. "
"Hit the nail in the head with four years being enough time to start dating someone else and get married. 

Op, it doesn't even seem like you would be missing this guy much. You just see each other once a month, he doesn't give you attention or ask you on dates, you put in all the effort in the relationship. What are you gaining from this?"
"From what I’ve read it sounds like you need more confidence. This post reads like someone who is trying not to be a bother. You aren’t bothering anyone by having wants, needs, and emotions! Be up front about what you’re looking for. Don’t settle for anything that makes you feel less than or uncomfortable. "
You should find yourself a doctor who does charity work and barely makes a living and then proudly introduce him 😁
"He's trying to manipulate you into feeling bad about ""rejecting"" him, it's a form of emotional abuse...

You can do better: Leave."
"Hey, this is just for advice on having chairs: unfortunately you found out after the fact, those racer/gaming chairs are NOT comfortable. What you want is an ergonomic office chair. Steelcase is one good brand for example. Definitely do some searches in r/pcmasterrace or even r/girlgamers for some recommendations.

As far as the relationship goes: just tell the truth! Honesty is the best policy! "
"I'm gonna go against the grain of the previous comments here. Even if there is no physical cheating the emotional entanglement between your bf and his bff is too much. Him staying over a few times a week with her is not healthy or normal. He is not a therapist which is what she needs. In doing this he is preventing her from getting better as she can use him as an emotional crutch. What would happen to her if you guys decide to move somewhere else? She needs to build healthy coping mechanisms, having her friend stay over and away from his SO is not healthy. "
"&gt;You're shutting down and hiding right now, and she isn't even around. Right now, your plan is to hope for a miracle where she decides to annoy someone else for the holidays.

Damn. The truth hurts a little. "
Why do you have to spend so much time with your parents? 
"Well, it was great up until August last year (when I found out he'd done something behind my back that hurt my feelings a lot). He didn't cheat, but it was to do with his ex gf. It took some time to work through that. Other than that, yes we're very happy. "
When looking for family therapy consider Parent Management Training! I’m a clinical psych grad student and have seen it work magic (also it’s evidence-based of course). The name sounds kind of silly but you and your mom would essentially sit down with a therapist and learn / brainstorm / troubleshoot how to shape kiddo’s behaviors. 
"You need to insist on couples therapy. Make this a dealbreaker. You are completely in the right and you need her to respect your boundaries as a victim of severe and heinous abuse. If she says ""it shouldn't be that serious"" tell her ""It's that serious to me."" 

Do you have your own personal therapist? They might be able to help you set boundaries with and explain things to your wife. Be firm here. You matter. Protecting yourself from your abuser matters. Downplaying your abuse can become abusive itself. Chances are that your wife really can't comprehend someone being that evil to their own child. But her good intentions don't affect the serious and even dangerous (to your mental health and stability) nature of what she's doing. Protect yourself, then communicate. Maybe you need to refuse to discuss it without a professional present. But protect yourself. You're worth it."
"I (M) got married at 28, my wife was the same age. I was always 100% clear that I wanted to have children. My soon-to-be-wife was ""pretty sure"" she would eventually be ready, maybe around 32-33, after having some time to enjoy our marriage and work on her career. I thought that was totally reasonable so we got married. For years she kept giving easons why she didn't think she/we were ready. Finally at 36 she told me she would never be ready. We talked to some counselors and eventually we got divorced. It was extremely painful for both of us and financially draining.

I bring up this story because it's somewhat similar to your situation. Maybe it's not fair to ask you to be 100% absolutely sure right now... but from his perspective, there's a lot of risk going into the marriage with somebody who's just not sure. If I could rewind I would find somebody who was 100% sure and on the same page as me.

So.. I guess you have a lot of soul searching to do. If you're not sure you need to be 100% clear with him that you aren't sure right now. If this is a deal breaker to him then... so be it. It'll be tough now but it would be tougher later on down the line. I would also perhaps suggest couple's counseling. It can be very helpful in getting your thoughts in order and makes clear communication easier. Good luck!"
"I think it might be a good idea to approach this the other way around. Instead of focusing on finding friends to do things with, start going by yourself and make friends there. Find a new hobby or activity that you think you might like. Book club, wine tasting, painting classes, playing an instrument, archery, rock climbing, doesn't really matter. Just something that you might enjoy that exposes you to new people."
"Girl if 600 was the market rent for a 1 bedroom sublet then that’s that. Regardless if you were only being charged 700 for the whole thing. Sounds to me like you found a super great deal, and then offered a bedroom up at market price. Absolutely nothing wrong, especially if your roommates weren’t family or super close friends. 

In my opinion, that shows that you’re savvy and smart with money. You didn’t force anyone to pay 600, they could’ve turned it down. Idk about your location or anything, but even finding a room for 600 is pretty cheap in a lot of areas!"
"I think their point was, mom probably is part of the problem. If your grown ass son acts like a child, clearly manners weren't on the top of the parenting list. That doesn't mean son doesn't listen to his mother. Mom's aren't always that stereotype we assume they are, no matter what culture we think of."
"Take it. It’s okay for him to be upset but it wouldn’t be okay for him to expect you to turn it down when you were carefully selected out of everyone who applied, it wouldn’t be okay for him to resent you for anything. That would make him immature and pathetic. Let him know you know he is sad and upset and you feel for him but it’s YOUR life and YOUR career and you better not think about putting that on hold or decide to pass on the job just because your boyfriend didnt get it. "
"Gonna point out that yelling in the car may have been especially bad since she couldn’t just leave, there’s an added trapped feeling."
"If you think there's something that might've happened between you and Mary, you might try asking Dana about it. ""Hey, Mary hasn't been very responsive to me since the wedding, and I haven't seen her in ages. I know she's busy, but did I inadvertently do something to offend her? I'd really appreciate your perspective.""

See what you get from that. 

If Dana doesn't have anything to offer, I would observe a couple of things that you may not be thinking about:

You and Mary are different ages, which has a couple of implications. You've had a three year friendship, which probably means that for you, Mary was one of your very first 'adult friendships' that wasn't formed via going to class/soccer practice/etc together. I'm guessing you met through work or a shared, adult hobby.

But Mary is four years older than you. You were probably *not* one of her first adult friendships. What's more, Dana is closer to her in age, and they may have more in common in terms of the life stage they're at. You're still in your mid-20s. Again, you haven't shared a ton of detail, but maybe Dana and Mary are both married and thinking about kids, or maybe Dana is at least in a long term committed relationship and you aren't, etc. Maybe they just talk about home ownership or parents getting old or *whatever*. My point isn't to illustrate that there's some magical shared thing in common, it's that there's a ton of 'stuff' that suddenly seems very important and timely in the 29-31 age bracket that seems like a ""yeah, I'll get to that eventually"" in your mid-20s, and might make Mary want to maintain a relationship with Dana even as she drifts away from you into married life.

Now, none of these facts make it easier to fall away from a friend, but they might help to explain why. It'll still be hard, and part of the solution to that is to fill your time up. The fact that this is so significant makes me suspect that you aren't someone who has many close friends -- why not make some more? You want to spend your time with people who are genuinely excited to spend their time with you; why not figure out the five or six people in your life who might be the next ""Mary"", and set up a drink after work with one of them per week for the next six weeks? :)"
"I gotta agree with madguins. I harshly judge people who have children when they can barely afford to take care of themselves. And I ain’t even sorry.

"Anybody who spends a half hour berating you is not good people. Anybody who spends a half hour berating you *about having a decent time at a party that he dragged you to* is very bad people. Frankly, it sounds to me like he *wanted* you to have a bad time, and when you didn't he *made* it a bad time. He probably wouldn't admit to that when asked, but that's what his behavior says. 

I'm sure that he's a great partner a lot of the time. If he wasn't, you wouldn't have stayed for two years. But what he just did is verbal abuse. Not only did her berate you, but he did it in a way that was designed to trigger your anxiety and make you afraid to talk to other people. 

This is a huge red flag. "
"I don’t think she’s in denial. She’s following THE most typical pattern of how people act when they’ve been caught cheating, but in a circumstance where all the evidence is circumstantial. She’s lying and gaslighting. She knows he’s not being controlling and she knows she’s doing something wrong, so she’s desperately trying to shift the focus from her behavior and actions to her husband’s because he doesn’t have concrete proof she’s having an emotional affair yet. If and when he finds that, and puts it in her face, she’ll switch to blind swearing and bargaining and promising him she’ll end it. Then she probably won’t. "

I can’t believe she got upset at you and then said you probably told them out of context....? What, that is the context and there is no time when hurting someone is okay. It’s not in a playful way, and she does it out of frustration, and anger. She’s probably just embarrassed that you blew her cover as the “perfect” girlfriend. Don’t tolerate any of this and definitely y’all more with close friends and family about this. Not healthy at all"
"It can take time for kids to develop the self-confidence they need to make friendships. However, ""He's never going to have these years again, and I want him to live them to the fullest"" does sound like you're putting a lot of pressure on him.

It might be a good idea to encourage him to take up extracurriculars outside of school. I had trouble making friends at school. If he doesn't fit in or is being bullied or something like that, the last thing he wants is to be part of a club that takes up MORE time at school.

Ultimately, though, I don't think your fear of him becoming reclusive is a major issue at this point. He's only 12 - his personality is still developing."

It sounds like Tina wants to live with Ron, which is pretty reasonable after being together for two years, and Ron won't hear about moving out of his current place. Tina's response is basically ""I won't live there if she does"", which I think actually means ""I don't want to live there"", not ""get her to move out and then I'll move in""."
"It’s mind blowing that as an adult he can’t seem to grasp this.

After thinking for about 5 minutes, she realized on her own that oh, it’s because he only sees her a week out of the entire year and the other 51 weeks are his adult time. She’s 9 and figured out that part time parents can be fun the whole time and that parenting is way harder on the person who is there 24/7, and yet OP’s grown husband can’t seem to figure that out. "

PLUS he’s totally gaslighting you by trying to turn the tables on you by being angry and scaring you into submitting to this weird manipulative reality he’s creating
You hit the nail on the head.   I think my wife had thoughts that having sex was wrong and dirty.  We had a deadbedroom for almost twenty years before I was ready to divorce.  She realized what was happening and forced herself to change almost overnight.  We have had a great sex life for about five years and my wife realizes now the lost happiness and joy that we could have had from the beginning.

"Yeah he’s kind of being an asshole.

Some girls work up until they give birth? Who gives a fuck what the other girls do. You need to do what’s best for you and your baby. He has no idea what it’s like.

"I tend to be pretty liberal with handing out ""dump him"" advice, but I think this is something you guys can work through.

To him, doing this stuff was probably on par with watching porn. Kind of like watching those live cam porn videos, but within direct messages instead. He obviously understands how much it hurt you and is willing to do what it takes to fix it (that's clear from the fact that he rushed home right away and deleted his snapchat altogether). Sexual vices can turn into habits that are hard to break. It was something that he was doing before you started dating (like watching regular porn) and he just never stopped. 

If you are having serious trust issues and paranoia much of the time, then couples counseling might be a good idea. I hope it works out."
"And what happens if she IS able to get in a reply before he runs away, or later she emails him or confronts him with a reply that's even more dismissive / disrespectful / all the things that misogynists think that only men have the right to be to women, not the other way around? It sounds he he will only become more obsessive and escalate. It was alluded to elsewhere in the thread but it sounds like he's really started reading a hate sub or something like that. 

I actually think your best bet is to repeatedly tell him that it's not appropriate at all for him to still be festering anger and hatred over this, that women have the RIGHT to be dismissive over his opinions and critiques, that women dismissing his opinion is NOT A PROBLEM, and if he can't let go of this obsession he needs to seek professional help. Then, every time he brings it up after that, repeat that he needs to seek professional help. And honestly, if this is the way that he's going, he'll probably listen to that message better from a man, not from you.

It really sounds like he now thinks the only appropriate response for women in response to his unwanted opinion or critique is submissive gratitude. That's a HUGE problem. The fact that he's been obsessing over getting ""revenge"" on this for SIX MONTHS and ""forcing her to respect him"" brings it into very scary territory for me. 

I shudder to think what would happen if he confronted someone like me over this. I very much enjoy verbal confrontation to people who think they can verbally bully me, and he would NOT be able to run away before hearing my reply; he wouldn't even be able to get his whole ""sick burn"" out. "

"She doesn’t seem to be picking up on any of the hints or subtleties you guys have been giving her. A conversation that is straight forward and tells her straight up that her behaviour is crossing boundaries needs to occur. Do not let your boyfriend use you as a scapegoat!

&gt;I just want to know how I can have a relationship with my sister without it being strained by the differences of our pasts.

Unless your sister is willing to accept your feelings as legitimate -- and she has made it clear that she won't -- you can't have a good relationship with her either.

Quite honestly, I would send a link to this post then ask her to leave.   There is absolutely no point in trying to keep up a relationship with someone who makes no effort whatsoever to understand your viewpoint."

"I would just say “That’s a pretty weird comment to make dude” in a lighthearted way and then change the subject and ignore him. If he brings it up again just say “again with the weird comments man! You can’t seem to stop!”

"So, I'm a lady, and I would never have gotten married without feeling 100% sure that my partner and I are on the same page about wanting kids. So I don't blame your partner in that, but I definitely hear what you're saying about the logistics NEEDING to be hammered out before you can agree to that. 

A lot of men, I think, are supremely unrealistic about the amount of work that goes into having kids and running a household, because they can generally be sure that their female partner will pick up the slack. I think the two of you need to get into counseling together and REALLY hash this out. "
"Tell him he has really shaken your trust. Have you just said to him, I can't trust you? 

When he tries to say what I actually said, and call him out on hurting you. Every time. ""That's not the understanding we came to and you know it. I don't care about word choice, I care that you are willfully going back on your word and putting more work onto me. You aren't being a good partner."" "
"That's fair. I really do think you need to twist your ex's arm to tell the kids. There is no scenario where his girlfriend should be a surprise. He doesn't seem to realize that it will ruin your daughter's birthday, and permanently inform her relationship with her father. She will remember this birthday as the birthday daddy's new girlfriend was more important to him than she was.

I'm sorry he's being such an ass about this. "

How would this even be possible, in a healthy relationship between adults? Do you have control of her finances and passwords?

This sounds miserable for her. You're policing what she eats, what she has on her phone, and seriously considering ""punishing"" her or contacting her parents. She has unhealthy eating habits. She probably needs therapy and a nutritionist. Nothing you are doing is going to change her. Quite frankly, even if she does make progress, there is a good chance of backsliding. Pregnancy, depression, physical health problems, trauma, loss, shame could all exacerbate the underlying issues that have caused all this. I feel bad for her. What you're doing now isn't good for her. If you can't accept that she might never change or that any changes might not be permanent, you should end this before you become more entangled or have children."
"&gt; I've known Frank my entire life and he's a dear friend of mine.

No, he's a guy who's been waiting for you to sleep with him. So when he was there, in your bed, whilst you were having sex with someone *else*, he decided to steal something that belonged to Bob. This was revenge because he felt like Bob had stolen something that belonged to *him*: you. 

Frank isn't a friend who is happy when you're having a good time. He's just waiting for his ""investment"" in you to pay off, with sex. "
"I understand why you’re not comfortable with this. It sounds like your boyfriend is set on her staying over no matter what. But you live together and both of you should get a say who stays the night. In this particular case I feel like he should have made sure that this solution would be ok for you. It clearly is not and while it might suck for him to have to let her know she should find somewhere else to stay, it’s his own inconsideration that put him in this position.

This is a “friend” who has shown that she does not respect your relationship by making comments like she has. It sounds like she feels entitled to your boyfriend and he just goes along with it.

I would sit him down again and fully outline the situation from your perspective. You should be able to act as a team before getting married."

Thanks for these tips. Hopefully I'll never have to quit for mental health reasons again but if it does happen again I will keep these in mind.
I agree with this. I think it's important to let people know right away that you don't want kids because that is a make or break deal with most people and you don't want to waste their time. But I agree with the oversharing concept. You're sharing too much too fast. It's mostly just overwhelming even if you are just trying to be honest and forthright. 
the ol Jehovah's Witness long con
"I'm honestly not too sure on the friend front for her. She has one close one who's at the house often, but when Britney is talking about her friends she fluctuates between telling us ""I have no friends, everyone hates me"" to ""I'm the most popular girl in school, everyone loves me"" so it's really hard to tell. She has hobbies for a couple months at most before they're not ""cool"" anymore, and then she just likes whatever is popular again. She was in tennis but she's in a cast now, which of course isn't helping her anger. She's really bad at school, and I'm not saying that to be mean. Like, she has zero interest in it and it takes her easily 3+ hours to do her homework every night. This usually dissolves into screaming matches between her and my mom.

She says she hates the school therapist, and from what I remember about the therapists this district employs I can't say I blame her. ""Bully"" is exactly the right word, I just can't believe she's never acted this way at school. We know she hasn't because she's received nothing but glowing reviews from her teachers in regards to her behavior."

"Hmong here as well. Go with the flow if you really feel a special connection with her and she feels the same. Yes, it’s taboo in Hmong culture, but marrying your first cousin is taboo in mainstream American culture. In reality, you both have grown with two cultures (assuming you are American) and have grown up with slightly tweaked values from your parents. Some cultural traditions just don’t ring as strong or relevant as they used to in the old country as they do not here in the states where I am. Like you said, the world is not going to explode. Here in the states you can marry by choice for love, and it’s just by chance that you share the same Hmong last name. You should also talk to her about it to gauge if this taboo is important to her. "
"Dude sounds insicure tbh. Did your fiance back anyone up or stay out of it? I wouldn't want to hang with any cousin that implies that my life sucks. Your job sounds like a great starter and the fact that you're proud of it is more important than anything else.     
        
If you want to try to correct this behavior you could try just being direct. Seriously, ""Ms. Degree?"" You can turn that around on him easy. Just make sure you and your fiance are on the same page. If not then there might be a bigger problem.     
      
That said nothing wrong with just ignoring cuz. Cutting them out is fair. Your fiance should be trying to fix this first though. Let him know how you feel."
"A first meet should ALWAYS be a public place. I follow that rule and I'm a 29 yo man. This guy way overstepped boundaries, I'd send one last text saying it didn't work out and you're moving on.

"I would reiterate 2 of heyyall's points. Firstly, make sure the officiant, photographer and DJ (if applicable) know and remind them on the day. Anyone who would be asking for the father of the bride (for photos, dance etc) needs to know not to keep calling out for him.

Secondly, tread carefully with any memorials. If she wants a chair, picture, pendant etc then someone can help to make that actually happen. But equally, if she doesn't want to draw attention to the fact he isn't here then that is totally fine and she shouldn't be pushed into that. "

I would tell him. Make it clear that you’d like to pursue more but you will have very limited energy for the time being to be put into the relationship. I would also stress that it’s fine if he can’t handle that you have cancer but you just want to be upfront. 
"""She's an only child to a single mom who tried to move heaven and earth for her""

"Maybe nothing immoral is happening, but you have to admit, it's weird. Even a good, but paid babysitter will often have a decent, chatty relationship with the parents. Would you tolerate a babysitter being this cold to you? I don't think so. 

The world's a rough place, I think I'd want to make sure I was surrounding my kid with people who I felt had healthy relationships, and had a lot of love to give. That doesn't seem to describe your brother or even your SIL. If your gut is telling you this isn't right, please listen to it. Maybe nothing weird/bad/wrong will happen to your daughter, but consider how you'd feel if you found out they were grooming her, or talking poorly of you to her, and you ignored your gut."
"You don't know you are going to die young. You are just assuming. So when you disclose your medical history and you desires around children you are also telling these people that you feel you have no hope for the future... that is a lot of the first date.

I think you can be up front about not wanting to have kids. And you can let them know about your medical issues, although that doesn't NEED to be first date talk, you are fine and healthy and aren't currently dying. But I think you are costing yourself connections by laying out the most doom and gloom possible about how you see the future on a first date. "

She's talked to them maybe 3 times since. They did not come to the gender reveal party.

Unfortunately, I do.

It's because now that he has you oathbound to him he no longer has to keep up the pretense.

"You don’t say this, but it sounds like she wants to have a baby, or is willing to take the risk.  You aren’t. When you said she was willing to get an abortion if she had a pregnancy before, but not won’t go through getting an IUD implanted again.....big red flag.  
If she gets her way with this, I don’t know how she won’t get pregnant.  You definitely don’t want to bring a baby into this world under those circumstances, and terminating a pregnancy is a lot more in depth than an IUD. 
I think your only option is you have to sit down with her and have a no holes barred conversation.  You don’t want kids, she has to be on birth control, or there will be condoms.  (Or no sex, which given how well that’s worked for you both, seems like the last option.). You will either be able to work it out, or it will end, but at least you know what is going to happen instead of this limbo. "

Not to mention that there’s a much deeper connection involved in messaging someone, flirting with them, and paying them money for private nude pics.

Characterizing this as “on par with porn” is downright dismissive of OP’s reasonable feelings of betrayal. And if they’re ever going to move past this as a couple, he needs to recognize the *actual* gravity of what he did and how it affected OP."
"Personally I'd ask my friends for help. Say that you don't know what to do and ask them what they'd do. So that way it won't look like you're bad mouthing her, you get your story out first and you might get some good advice from them too. Either way, get your side out first. Though not being funny, I doubt anyone would think that you would date someone paralyzed from the waist down just for the sex. Dating someone with any form of medical complication can be tricky, they'll know it was more than sex for you."
"Seriously. This has nothing to do with meal prep and everything to do with misaligned expectations. I feel bad for all those kids, who have to listen to dumb fights about cutting vegetables and god know what else..."
"She chose to fucking leave because YOU won’t stand up for her. This is your own fault. You didn’t protect her from her drug addicted brother, who you didn’t help as well might I add. And then you won’t protect her against your husband because you’re too much of a coward to stand up to your husband. That’s not “Christian”, that’s cowardice and unjust. Be a parent for once woman, ffs. Your “broken heart” does NOTHING, you’re the one pushing your daughter away. "
Seriously why are you with him?
"What do you mean by ""you shut the discussion/disagreement down"" before getting into the car? Depending on what happened in that argument and how you ""shut it down"" I could maybe understand his pov."
"You deserve better! I know things are not always black and white but what radiates to me through this post is that you're loyal, afraid of letting go - I know, been there. You're still young and based on this post you're much better off alone"
"&gt;what should I do?

Option 1: split the tab at the venue instead of sending each other invoices after the fact

Option 2: don't date him"
"Hate to be overly dramatic or jump to conclusions but this guy might be depressed/suicidal. Definitely tell your brother but just express your concern for the situation and see if your bro can talk to him calmly and figure out what’s up. If he’s having a hard time the talk with your bro might help and then further steps can be taken if necessary. 

If he’s not - hey - who knows what drugs he was smokin, but at least you and your bro will have tried to address the situation / are aware of what’s going on. "
"Go sleep with someone, ask him to get back together and see how he feels 😂"
"&gt; Sounds like a pint-gallon problem to me.

Man, I am 44, have been in therapy, a marriage, a LTR, and have read this subreddit for 7-8 years, and I have never read or heard this analogy. But it's really a good one, thanks!"
"Girl, what!? This guy has disrespected you in multiple instances and ways. You need to see him one last time, get his phone and DELETE any nude/compromising pictures he has of you (look in photos, his cloud, and his texting conversations - delete the whole conversation if you have to). Then kick his butt to the curb. You can do so much better. "
"If you keep giving them money, they'll keep taking it. I'll be amazed if you ever see one dime of what you ""loaned"" them ever again. 
 
""I simply cannot give you this money, or any more money for the foreseeable future. On that note, when can I expect your first check?"""
Congrats on your sobriety and fostering openness and communication in your relationship!! Very happy for you 
"So your boyfriend thinks you're going to become a dude-bro after hanging out with your dad and brothers?

Listen, I agree him when he said, ""I screwed up"" because he **majorly** screwed up.  And then he doubled down and said that he thinks you're too manly.

Essentially, he's going to try to change you so you're ""girlie"" enough to meet his expectations.  I don't know about you, but if he's that uncomfortable with who you are as a person, he can go find someone else to date.  I think you'll be better off in the long run also."
"I think seeing it in the reverse helps too: if your boyfriend liked you and like the person you are, he'd be super HAPPY about the men in your life who raised you to be the person you are and would be glad when you spend time with them!"
"I encourage you not to see the child as bratty and misbehaving - it seems like there are several issues in her family life that are contributing to the way she's acting out. She quite possibly is not adjusting well to having to 'share' her mother, she does seem to have some food-related issues (is there lack of food stability at her father's perhaps?), and your GF is not really doing a good job with discipline or curbing the behavior. None of these are the child's fault. 

Dating a person with kids is a special challenge in and of itself. It's a new relationship, and you haven't signed up to be a father (figure) so if you determine this isn't the relationship for you, that's very fair. Honestly it sounds like your GF needs some parenting classes or family counseling to get at the root of the child's behavior, and until she does spending time with her is going to be quite unpleasant for anyone. "
"Yeah, they are basically having an affair right in front of her. I bet you it's part of the excitement for the both of them. He is acting all dumb and naive because he probably figures that if he can gaslight her into thinking she is crazy, that they can still have this open ""hot"" affair. 

 I realize that OP is desperate for hope that her husband is innocent in all of this, but boy is she being willfully naive. And it's not surprising that they are doing this to her.  She said herself that she can't confront her friend, which means that OP has a doormat non-assertive type of personality that both her friend and her husband are taking advantage of.  If her husband was committed, he wouldn't be engaging with this friend of hers. He wouldn't be Skyping her cute emojis and then hiding his Skyping activity from OP. He would be avoiding her at gatherings. He is 100% complicit in all of this.  They are disgusting people. "
"She needs more than an app and loving support. This is near-disordered eating and she needs to see a specialist to discover why she's eating like this and how to change the behavior effectively. Until that happens, it will likely not be possible to tackle this issue."
"&gt; His way of complaining about something is quitting.

BINGO. He legit doesn't understand that people deal with problems because they don't really have the option not to."
"Dude. Your brother is 10. He will have plenty of time later to find out how cold the world can be. Your boyfriend is reacting in the “I did without so everyone else should” way rather than the “I missed out and so want others to have better” way, and he’s wrong. What you want to do for your brother is really sweet and just a great thing to do as his sister, because he’ll remember you were there for him, you noticed him and made him feel special. Even when his own dad didn’t. (Which I have feelings about but I’ll keep them to myself.)

Edit: boyfriend would probably benefit from therapy to learn to stop thinking no one should have a better life than he’s had."
"Oh dear. I was in this exact situation with my ex. He always had money for himself but never enough when it came to helping me. Even bought himself $800 glasses for READING when I need glasses 24/7 and would only ""let"" me have $60 for a frame. Because he spent it all on himself. He also took trips every year with ""his boys"" but we never took a single family trip together alone. Magically never had money for that. He even went with his friend's family for their kid's first trip to Disneyland while our child, who is older than their kid, started home with me. Dumped at his mom's place.


Here's what you do. Move out. Get your own place, take his ass to court for child support.


I hate saying this because it hurt so much for me to realize all those years ago but he doesn't want you in his life. He doesn't see you as a partner but as a house ornament for him to have sex with. Now he gets a kid out of it and he'll treat the child the same way as in he'll expect to be worshipped by the kid as their dad but hardly ever do anything for them. 


You'll already be doing all of the work. Might as well do it all on your own terms. Leave him now. I wish I had. I wish I had left and given my kids my last name because he doesn't deserve it. They're trophies to him. He still sucks up all their achievements no matter how small as somehow something he contributed to. He lives thousands of miles away and literally never calls them."
Yeah I was reading this thinking the exact same thing. OP is lucky this creep left. Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it.
4 kids before 27 leads me to believe this was  a very early marriage probably set up by family and religion.
Coming first does not equal letting him abuse your child. Which is what he's doing. Did you even talk to him? tell him how completely unnacceptable his behavior is? How can you put your child through this after all she's already gone through.
"On another note, if you're working with violent behaviours you should potentially change wards or look at becoming office based. I'm a psych nurse with violent older adults and never would we allow somebody 6months pregnant on the ward. That punch in your face could be your stomach. "
"The first version of the post OP wrote, posted in a different sub, was exactly the same but didn’t include the details about lying about cheating. I think there is probably more to that story that OP isn’t sharing, because I can’t see how if that actually happened the way it’s described she could possibly write a post about this and not include it. 

The fact that it’s only half of one sentence here makes me think her friends said something like “how do you know he wasn’t cheating on you during [x event]” and OP is characterizing that as them claiming to have caught him cheating when he wasn’t. "
"Your daughter witnessed your son *shoot heroin in front of her* because you thought she was 'okay.' 

You ignorantly assume that because your daughter knows how to keep her head down and keep quiet that she's 'okay.' Do you actually care about how she feels, or do you just want her to keep being 'okay' so you don't have to deal with it?"
"They're taking advantage of you financially. It sounds like you're both very insulated there, and your wife has become socially dependent on this family. I think you could really benefit from couple's counseling. "
"Don't sit down, tell him as you're packing. "
"I was thinking about this too, see if you can swap with him. "
"LOL I used to go on business trips.  He is NOT ""working"" 24/7."
"You kind of have to deal with the mother of his child regardless.  Does he have to run over constantly....that is on him.

But it doesn't seem like you fit this scenario.  His daughter is autistic and seems high stress.  You sound like you want a normal life with a normal date schedule.  That will NEVER be this guy.  Even if he stops rushing over constantly the child will always be needy and she will always come first.  That will never change."
"People think that getting married means that your libido shuts off automatically for other people. You still have eyes and the ability to feel attraction to other people.

How you manage that attraction is what's important. Consider it window shopping. You can look but you don't need to go in and buy anything. "
"&gt; I need to tell him this.

No you don't. It's over. His bad habits aren't your problem anymore."
"Let her come and stay with you, and don’t be shy about telling her why. 

Let her be the mama bear while the two of you present a united front. 

He can sit with his own shame while you do what you need to do."
"That's just more manipulation to hurt you and keep you stuck. Honestly, the more you talk about him the more he sounds emotionally abusive.

What I'd do is not tell him you're planning to leave. Get the logistics sorted out - do you live together? Do you have joint finances? Figure out what you're going to do with the practical stuff.

I'm going to go ahead and guess that he's alienated you from most of your support system. This might be a good time to reach out to them for help. I'm guessing that, if you tell them that you're trying to leave, they'll be very happy to get you away from this jerk.


Once you're away, block him everywhere. Do not allow him to talk to you, even for a second. He's good at manipulating you to feel bad about everything and doing whatever he wants. It will take you time to get over that programming, and every time you see him it will set you back.

Secondly, get therapy. If money is a concern, and you live in the US, you can call 211 to find low-cost or no cost. One of the worst things and an abusive relationship is that it screws with your head long after. You find yourself falling back into unhealthy patterns because it feels normal to you. You excuse inexcusable behavior because at least it isn't as bad as the last guy. 

I know it sounds daunting, but you're stronger than you think. If you weren't, he wouldn't be investing so much time to tear you down."
"Right? OP, go read up on all the ""she wants me to stop talking to my woman friends/stop texting them/delete pictures of them"" posts and realize that a behavior we normally see in people in their early twenties, when people are still figuring out their emotional processes and rights when it comes to relationships, is showing up in a 43-year-old woman. And then ask yourself why you would want to keep dating a woman whose maturity level is that of a 23-year-old who hasn't figured out that her boyfriend isn't going to cheat on her just because she checks his phone use and cries when he doesn't text her back in thirty seconds."
"My boyfriend bought me some fancy roller skates for my birthday. They looked beautiful and cost a lot of money, but they didn't feel right on my feet. I had him return them for a refund and then today we went shopping together for skates in person. I found some awesome inline skates that are indoor/outdoor and way better suited to my feet and style of skating, and they were like $50 less. I am in love. And my boyfriend didn't mind me asking to return the first pair if it meant that I would actually use the second one. :)"
Yeah I cannot believe this is even being asked fuck that guy. 
"&gt;'' Hey so we will bring thanksgiving desert? To ensure it’s nut/dairy free'' so this is the way she talk to us, for some reason she needs to take digs in normal conversation, whatever she's been like this her whole life.

You know her tone of voice, but to me that doesn't sound like a ""dig."" It sounds like a mom trying to communicate clearly what her child needs in order to *not potentially die* while visiting Grandma and Aunty. 

Your description of your sister sounds a little resentful, and I don't know what the history is there. But honestly, even if your sister has a history of being a huge jerk, the issue of her child's life and health is one area where she's kind of allowed to be pushy and blunt. As far as how to earn back her trust, there's no single magic gesture that's going to do it. Your mom has screwed up ""a few times"" even by your own admission. She's established a pattern of forgetting. It's not enough to just break the pattern, your mom is also going to have to show she's in a pattern where she takes the nut allergy seriously. And that's just going to take time, and getting it right over and over and over again.

And as others have mentioned, the core issue here is between your mom and your sister. It isn't something you need to referee, and it's something you *shouldn't* try to referee because you ultimately have no control over the parties involved. "
Yes exactly. She keeps saying she’s going to sleep in “our bed” and I keep telling her we won’t be in the same bed or the same room. 
Is it a coincidence she looks like you're sister or....?
"You're going to have to learn that people who have successful relationships are more likely to have learned to respond calmly to stressors, approach people with assumptions of good intent, remove a need for blame from problems, know how to self soothe so they don't have to look to others to calm them, and attack problems with partners as Us against the problem, not you against me. 


You and your bf have a lot of communication challenges and it sounds like you're both sick of eachother and assuming the worst and making drama over nothing. If you aren't willing to take total responsibility for your feelings and your actions you aren't going to get anywhere."
[removed]
Yeah just tell him. Boyfriends come and go back pain is forever lol
"Honestly, you can't get through to him.

He's lived in a bubble of privilege all his life.  Unless he is exposed to the harsh realities of life outside that bubble, without having the ability to retreat to it, he's never going to change.  Why would he?  He's living life on easy mode.  Why would he need to play on hard mode?

He doesn't have sympathy because he's never experienced the things you have.  The really disturbing thing is he has no *empathy* for others.  He can't see other's viewpoints because that would contradict with his own worldview of luxury."
I wouldn't tell them. That'll paint you as the bad guy. Tell him if he doesn't tell her I'm there next two weeks that you think it will be really hurtful for your daughter on her birthday. You are already going above and beyond allowing this woman on your vacation I don't know how you are doing if.
"He's trying to control you. Keep you isolated. Speaking from experience, by controlling you, you won't leave and he's free to do whatever he wants. The true question is what is he afraid you'll find?"
"That's it.

It's not a problem if your partner is fucking other men, ***if you discussed it***.

When lies and accusations come into play, you should immediately see red flags spring up like a redneck barbecue on the Fourth of July."
"I notice that you're basing your assumptions off of something in this guy's social media. I wouldn't trust that as his real opinion!

Here's the thing: if you're a high-end trainer or model, *you* are the commercial product. These guys are required to maintain an image on social media to generate business.

I could see that posted conversation as an attempt to sell the fit lifestyle. Plenty of women have concerns about getting too muscled from training, and the (possibly completely fictional) barber is being argued out of the ""curves in the right places"" mindset. This sounds like a subtle ad/plug for his services.

OP, once things develop to a place that you're comfortable broaching the subject with the guy, I'd ask him how closely his social media ""brand"" aligns with him personal life. I'm guessing he's slightly exaggerated himself online."
2 months in is way too early to be expected to shoulder her problems. She mistreated you and imo you're putting way too much blame on yourself. I'd say walk away and move on. 
"I have the exact same issue with my mom. When she does stuff like that I told her "" I care about you and your happiness, but I can't emotionally handle you venting to me. Also, I suggest you see a therapist because they are better eqquiped to help you than I am."" I had to keep putting emphasis on that point because my mom kept saying she wasn't crazy. I told her "" I'm not saying your crazy but crying everyday is not normal. If you were shot with a gun you wouldn't ignore it , you would go to the doctor. It's the same situation when you don't feel great emotionally, don't ignore it go see a doctor. "" The hard part is enforcing it, if your mom tries to be emotionally manipulative, don't feed into, just say your sorry she's upset  and change the subject. If you need a communication break from your mom, you're allowed to have one. Until yesterday, I didn't talk to my mom for a month and it was great. "
"My mother is an ER ped. You will regret backing down. It took an excessive amount of drive to be where you are; never give that up for ANYONE else. Residency is going to suck regardless, but at least you will be in the specialty that you wanted. There will be times (A LOT OF THEM), where that is the only thing that will keep you going during residency. Don't do this, OP. Do not give into this man. 

Run if you need to, but do not go into a specialty that is not your first choice if the only thing holding you back is a man-- ESPECIALLY not peds. Peds takes a special kind of human- maybe not academically compared to what you're looking at, but the amount of bullshit they go through for a lesser pay than most specialties is extraordinary.

Please I am begging you. Do not do this to yourself. Do not make yourself smaller for this man. "

"As long as you 1. never do anything that might show you as more competent than him and 2. hide your abilities, everything should be fine.

I had a boyfriend in high school who ghosted me when I scored higher than he had on the SAT. He was a year ahead and very invested in being r/iamverysmart and his ego couldn’t take it. It sucked but was the best outcome in the end. "
