"Have a heart-to-heart-conversation with your brother. Tell him that you and your parents are considering not going and tell him why. It's his job to fix this. If he responds as petty as his fiance, then you may already have a damaged relationship with him."
"&gt;She'd like to meet my wife and her niece without hiding it from the family

She can do that without any action on your part to make up with your parents.  Tell her she's welcome to visit you and your family any time she likes.  Do not engage in discussion about these other people.

Your sister is 6 years younger and has only heard your parents side of what happened when she was what 12?  She's plenty old enough now to understand that you've made your own decisions for your life and she should respect them."
"Take a picture of the device.

Tell your husband you have to go back to the shop.

If he goes out to the garage wait until he comes back in and you can go out as well without him knowing.

Check for the device, take a picture if it not there.


If it's not there I would call a friend immediately and tell them you need to have them check up on you in 15 minutes. Confront your husband if you feel safe doing so."
"&gt;She'd like to meet my wife and her niece without hiding it from the family, and thinks I can meet my family somewhere in the middle.

What middle does she imagine there is for this? A middle where they only kind of disown you? A middle where they are only a little ashamed of you? A middle where they only sort of treat your wife badly? A middle where they only say mildly homophobic things to your child about her parents?

Go with your gut. This is a big nope. They aren't interested in you at all. They just want to get their hands on your daughter. Babies are narc food because they provide lots of attention without any criticism. Your mom wants to post cute pictures to Facebook and play grandmother of the year. Don't let that happen. Protect your child and don't ever teach her that people as damaged as your family are safe people to be around."
"Why are you paying your brother's soon to be father in law for your hotel room?  Why not just book it yourself and pay what they charge you?  Most hotels ""block out"" rooms for weddings and when people don't buy them they just book them to people not in the wedding.  It shouldn't cost you any more than the rate the hotel is charging.  If your brother's father in law booked an entire block of rooms on his own dime and is expecting to make up the difference by overcharging everyone for people that aren't going, that's his own damn fault."
"&gt; he’s almost strangled her

Men who choke are men who kill. 

B will kill J. 

Call the police. It's not like just because it happened last night (or whenever), that it's not still a crime. You will need J's cooperation, but seriously, if you value J at all as a person, you need to call the police. B will kill her. Period."
"Answer ""because I am not your mother or your maid"". I'd suggest leaving him with the house, dealing with shit for a week while you get away to take a breath. Let him know that he can either be ready to work on it when you come back, including couple therapy, or this marriage likely won't make it in the long run. When you come back act on your  agreement. Schedule the appointment. 

At some point the goal would be for you guys to discuss how to split and manage the workload but you likely won't be able to without a counselor and before addressing the deeper issues. And for what it's worth, it's helpful to look at your actions too and be ready to accept some constructive criticism too. He may feel insecure or inadequate and use this as an excuse."
"&gt; If he responds as petty as his fiance, then you may already have a damaged relationship with him.

And it won't be you who is responsible."
"I disagree about the part where it's advised to include
&gt; and your parents are considering not going....
 
As a general life rule, don't speak on behalf of others (in this case your parents). What your mom says to you was not intended for your brother or else he would have heard it from her.  She's an adult.  Let her speak for herself.  

 If you choose to discuss with him, state why **you** are having issues. 

Extra note: If you don't have your clothes fitted by now, I think any bride or groom would freak out and call you every day.  It's common to take care of this for weddings (U.S.) 4-6 months out from the date."
"Hold your ground. 

Your sister is trying to take the path of least resistance and is hoping there’s a solution where everyone ends up happy. That doesn’t exist - your parents’ happiness is mutually exclusive with yours. She’s not *bad* for hoping this...we do tend to teach people, especially young women, to avoid conflict and always look for compromise. But he hopes do not obligate you to act. Either your sister agrees to meet you alone, as she has done previously, or it doesn’t happen at all. 

If your sister protests, you might ask her where, among your parents’ entitled demands and accusations, they offered you an apology for disowning you and a promise to treat your children better than they treated you. When she comes up empty, let her sit with that. Hopefully the lesson sinks in for her."
"As someone who worked in the wedding industry for years let me just tell you that this is a very very bad sign for what their marriage is going to be like. One of the top reasons for divorce (other than infidelity) is financial problems. If someone can truly afford a big fancy destination wedding then by all means, go for it, but if you are strapped for cash but insist on having this destination anyway to the point that its ruining life long relationships... yikes. A TERRIBLE start to a marriage. Marriage is already hard enough, why start out on such a bad foot? Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that you should voice your concerns to your brother one on one because this is a bigger problem than just an expensive wedding. His fiancée and her family sound awful and it sounds like he’s being steamrolled. Be completely honest. If he still continues to side with his ridiculous fiancée and her ridiculous family then you’ve done all you can do."
"Date someone who looks at you, the way you look now, and thinks, ""Damn, I did good."""
"Yes, this is a HUGE red flag. They could also be trying to lump the cost of the wedding in with the rooms and dividing it up among guests so they don't actually need to 'pay' for the wedding celebration (or part of it). Remember, it's all likely part of the same all inclusive wedding package.

OP should contact the resort and ask for clarification on his room rate for the wedding. If it's significantly lower than what fiance's family has told them, then it's time to have a Come to Jesus with his brother."
I recommend both of you read the comic “You should’ve asked” by Emma. I tried to explain the concept of mental load (being the manager in a relationship) to my partner several times. That comic helped me to finally get through to him.
"Keppra is well known for being The Worst. They actually call it KeppRage because of the ... well, rage. Outside of reducing his dose or switching his meds, there isn’t a lot to be done for it. 

I am going to try to be gentle but real with your here. Barring a miracle, your boyfriend’s glioblastoma diagnosis is terminal. They may have gotten the whole tumour, but it will come back. Soon. And it’s so unfair, because you are at a point in your lives and relationship where you should be planning a future. However, given his diagnosis, the only future he has will be very short. His tumour and his meds are stealing a lot of who he is from him, just like they are stealing the future you are supposed to have. It’s so, so unfair. But it’s the reality. 

Please know this:

When he rages at you, that’s not him.
When he breaks up with you, that’s not him.

However, you also don’t have to take it or submit to a situation where you feel unsafe. When he is acting like this, don’t take it personally. Don’t argue with him because you cannot argue with a tumour. Remove yourself from the situation if it gets too bad or if you are in danger. Give yourself space to breathe. Then reengage later when he is more himself and enjoy whatever time you have. 

You are not obliged to stay in a relationship with anyone at any time, and if the situation becomes too bad, it’s ok to go. But know that you don’t have to just accept his rages."
"I completely agree! I just would hesitate to give OP's address to the sister in case she tries to ""reconcile them"" and give it to OP's parents. Perhaps meet somewhere neutral. But yes, if sister wants to meet with OP without hiding it from the family, she totally can. Like IcyWheel said, do not engage in discussion about these other people."
"&gt; If my partner went missing for 2 days without telling me if his was alive/dead, I would be so upset.

If my partner went missing for 2 days without telling me if his was alive/dead, he’d better be dead."
I guess I’m just confused why a ring was bought but not like put on your finger right away? My fiancé and I custom made our ring and when it was complete we had a beautiful dinner and he put it on me that day...
"If my partner went missing for 2 days without telling me if his was alive/dead, I would be so  upset. It's so unbelievably cruel to do that to you.

This whole situation (coupled with the other issues that you've mentioned) would be a dealbreaker for me, for sure. Even being high doesn't excuse it - my boyfriend occasionally takes drugs with his friends (in the house) but he always tells me about it first, and always lets me know he's OK."
"If you have a laptop, now would be a good time to take it to a computer repair professional and have it checked for keyloggers."
"*Babies are narc food because they provide lots of attention without any criticism.*

That's a really good point that I've never realized."
This person knows how to catch people putting tracking devices on cars.
Tell him you'll make it to the next wedding
"&gt;we’ll talk calmly about the wedding and two hours later his fiancé will text me and be very demanding

I don't think the brother is going to be petty. Rather, he's passively standing by and letting his fiance (and her family) treat his own family like sh\*t. Bad behavior, but a d ifferent kind."
And the other classics “my wife left me because I left my dishes by the sink” “she feels like your mom and doesn’t want to bang you” and “the magic coffee table”
It sounds like they are doing this with everything.  $200 for makeup for a member of the family?  They are absolutely trying to farm out all the costs onto the guests so they don't have to pay the full cost of anything.
"This. Absolutely. He's now comfortable enough to beat on her with OP present, he's escalating and will keep escalating. 

He's also testing OP's loyalties. On woe, I might get hit by a car (really? Really now.), plz come get me. Then let's have a nice brekkie where we mention nothing at all."
"Considering how much education costs, do you really want to add $$$$$ to your student loan by repeating a year? It's time to start minimising contact with your friend. Only invest in enough time that you can afford and that won't affect your grades. If he wants to screw up his time at college, that's on him. If you let him do it to you, that's on you."
"As another lesbian mom: disownment is permanent.  They don’t get to “un-disown” you when they want to.  If I were in your shoes, I’d tell them, and your sister, that I have no parents - I got disowned.  

And your gut is absolutely right - if you let these homophobes into your life, they will mess up your kid.  Don’t let them mess up your kid.  Your first and foremost duty as a mom is to protect your kid."
"I agree with your assessment that your husband is the most likely culprit. 

Not only does your husband not trust you, he believes it is acceptable to egregiously violate your right to privacy. The fact that he did so surreptitiously indicates that, in actuality, it is you who cannot trust him."
"Whenever someone says ""Oh you should not take steps to protect yourself because you will ruin that person's life,"" it's bullshit. The person who has hurt, intimidated, or threatened you should not get to keep doing so with impunity. If his life gets ""ruined,"" it will have been *his* doing, not yours. 

Pursue the protective order. Stay safe!"
"Another red flag is the fact that the groom is doing absolutely 0 and literally pretending this drama isn't happening, rather than standing up to his fiancee and asking her family to treat his with respect."
His next wedding will probably be easier on him.
"It doesn't sound like your family have changed at all. Blowing up your social media, throwing accusations, using emotional manipulation and most importantly no apologies..... If you got back into contact with them, you would just be creating more problems for yourself and for your children in the future. 

If I were you I'd say to your sister she can visit you on her own. I don't see why she would have to hide it from them - they're just not invited. But that you getting in contact with the rest of your family is not up for debate. 
See how she responds to that and if she respects it."
"Be prepared for the bride to post a long, unhinged Facebook rant after the wedding completely falls apart that goes viral for being the most jaw-droppingly entitled thing most people have ever read in their lives."
"I think you're way past gentle. You're probably into ""find a place and move out and don't move back in until he gets his shit together"" territory.

You two need to get into couples therapy and you need individual therapy for yourself."
"&gt; but I’m just trying to protect myself. 

You are doing the right thing. He can ruin your credit at 18 years old and put you in a hole that will take many years to fix. He can affect your ability to eventually by a house or a car. Do not, under any circumstances let him do this, AND check your credit reports to make sure he hasn't already done it.

A person who is responsible with his money would NEVER need to open a card in his child's name, end of story."
"This wasn't an easy read, so goodness knows how upsetting it must have been for you both.



From your account of things here I do think that you were unfair to your wife. One thing that sticks out to me the most is that you did not do full night shifts with the children even when you weren't working. I think it was unreasonable of you to expect your pregnant wife to go out to work to support you financially and then have her spend all of the night awake with the kids, especially since you yourself used work as an excuse not to be more involved with your children.



You talk a lot about your struggles and hardships but these seem to amount to home sickness and that being a parent to a newborn is tiring. I do sympathise on that first point but sleep deprivation is something all new parents go through and I really don't think it was reason enough for the behaviour you've described.



I hate to say it but nothing can change the past. I wish I had some constructive advice to offer but my ex partner didn't help with our child and we really never overcame that. Maybe try marriage counselling."
"Since your son is only 5 months old, you're still IN this phase, not past it. So the resentment isn't old, its current, and that changes things a bit.

I would suggest having a heart to heart with your wife. Ask if you can agree that this phase of parenting just sucks, and because of that it's probably best not to make any big decisions about your marriage for another 6 months to a year.  Ask her for the one biggest concrete thing you can do to signal your willingness to be a team with her - maybe it's ""don't bring the baby to me to soothe unless you've tried unsuccessfully for at least 30 minutes (assuming he's been recently fed)"" or maybe it's ""take baby out of the house every day so I can get quality time with our daughter"" - brainstorm together. 

My husband was gone for the infant year and I resented it even though it was out of his control (military) but when he came home he refused to let me change a diaper for the whole second year of her life. He said I did the first year so he had the second one. That kind of thing goes a LONG way: it shows he recognizes the disparity, sees that it's an issue, has a plan to balance it, and takes the initiative. You need to come up with something similar you can do to show your wife you're her teammate."
"Freeze your credit, he has all the info he needs to do it without your permission"
"Let's not forget what is really going on here.

Fiance's family WAS ALREADY GOING TO BE AT THE DESTINATION. They just decided to coordinate the wedding to happen alongside their family reunion.

It's a sunk cost for fiance's family, who was already planning on spending money to be there, decided the location, etc.

OP's family was an afterthought, 'Oh we'll invite them and hopefully they can come.' OP's brother is probably just 'rolling with it' because 'brides right'? 

OP should be honest and up front with his brother about everything. How it's one thing to have it someplace expensive, and that he wants to celebrate a marriage that makes his brother happy, but it's a whole other to ask for a financial subsidy from OP or his mother, INSTEAD of asking up front for a gift (which is still rude IMO, but at least they could plan within their budget).

Oh, and OP should stop responding to fiance's texts, and only communicate with his brother."
"Look. You need to set boundaries with this guy, or he is going to pull you way down. 

“Dude, I am tired of hearing about dicks.”
“Dude, pull your fucking pants up in my room.”
“Dude, make better life choices.”

You just need to extract yourself."
"My way of coping with my wife's deteriorating health was to research for hours on end how to heal her.

He's being protective of his phone because he feels guilty, likely about Grindr/Tinder, and he's also been actively trying to hide it from you...

It's a bit hard to guess what's going on in his mind and why he's doing this without actually getting it out of his own mouth. How about you try asking him how he feels about your potential condition and how stressful it is for him? Then you could ask him about his commitment to you, and if he says that he's still fully committed, ask him what pushed him to start using those apps. It could be stress, insecurity or a lack of commitment, but it's better to determine the cause before challenging him on his questionable actions."
"False eyelashes are applied with glue and are usually pretty sticky when they come off, it easily could have hitched a ride on either of your clothing."
"I worked in the auto industry for over 15 years. This is so unbelievably common. 9 times out of 10, it's a husband/boyfriend/Ex tracking a woman."
"It’s a video skit where a guy is trying to show off this coffee table as magic because every time he makes a mess on it, it magically disappears. Meanwhile his wife/girlfriend/whatever relation is annoyed because she’s the one who cleans it up and he has no conceptualization of the work she does. It’s silly but it highlights the real issue where some men experience messes getting dealt with but have no idea of the effort that going into maintaining a household."
"The fact he even told you about this crush, and shut it down, gives me a lot of hope for you two. Good people make mistakes, but he didn’t. He clearly still wants this relationship to work. Professional help would really be the way to go. But, if you’re still holding off, maybe just take time to get to know each other again. You may feel like you know everything, but learn what you missed in the distant few years. Go on dates, and look up deep questions to ask each other. You might be surprised at the other’s responses, and this new side of your partner can awake the spark once again"
"Nah, all props to OP for having the presence of mind to remember and relate the importance of him going out to the garage when she first mentioned the oil change."
"Tell him you want a set weekly date night. Take turns planning what you do, so you both have to put effort into finding new and fun things to do together. Even if it's just going somewhere new for dinner. Talk to him about breaking up routines. You can only fix this if you both put the effort in. If he isn't interested in helping to keep the relationship exciting or fresh, then this may not be the partner for you."
"Meet in public though, with your own transportation and a quick exit plan, in case the sister decides to take matters into her own hands and bring the parents along to ""fix"" things. And don't let ANY of them have your home address, OP!"
"The way you phrased it, to me, read as if you think your efforts are some huge accomplishment, but what you are describing is just.. parenting. It is not some great unusual sacrifice to be a parent to your child. And you wrote that you think it’s reasonable to expect your pregnant wife, who works full time to take over at night because you are tired. But it sounds like you didn’t actually step in to help her with nights in the beginning. You do realize that it was equally tiring for your wife, right? But she did it anyway because she had to because she was a parent now. I get the feeling that you seem to think of your struggles as kind of unique and special and particularly hard. But it isn’t. All the thing you bring up is just completely normal “having a baby” stuff. You aren’t extraordinary for experiencing this nor for doing your part. You come of as if you feel you deserve praise for stepping up, yet you don’t seem to think your wife deserves extra credit or praising for doing the same things, aka being a parent. And no, it’s not reasonable to expect your pregnant wife who, works full time to support your family, to get up and take the nights because you are tired. And especially not after the second time. That right there is why she resents you, you are way to self centered, you aren’t thinking about her struggles or her feeling or her achievements. No wonder she regrets it, she’s probably picking up on your pride over actually stepping up and being a parent, while still not actually pulling your full weight. You left her all alone with the responsibility of your first child and then when you were supposed to step up and be the primary parent you still didn’t and you lazily gave up after minimal effort, after the second time, because *you* were tired. Have you even considered how you wife felt when you basically left it all to her in the beginning? Don’t you think she was tired then? Don’t you think she was tired after working full time everyday while pregnant? You need to re-evaluate your perspective on this cuz she definitely isn’t the one who seem to have a wrapped perspective here. You don’t seem to value your efforts equally, you sound like her parenting your child is an expectation while you doing so is a major sacrifice and an extra effort, outside of normal expectations, to be celebrated and praised. It sounds like you might have a “I’m helping” attitude. You aren’t *helping* her with *her* children. They are you children too, you are simply being a parent to *your* kids. If you want to try to salvage this, you need to contemplate what kind of attitude your showing and if you are taking your fair share of the responsibilities for your family. A good way to check that is if you both write up everything you do, every day for a week or so and check to see if you are doing the same amount of work. And don’t forget the emotional labor of a relationship and parenthood. Keeping track of this, being the designated project leader of your lives, is also work. A lot of work. There are a lot of videos circulating the web, clearly showing the unequal distribution of that work. You know the kind I’m referring to? The videos where they interviewed both parents and asks them questions about their children, when is their birthdays, what’s their best friends name, what’s the name of their teacher/GP/dentist/etc. Where the moms can answer every single question and the dads don’t even know when their was born. Are you that kind of dad? Do you know when they have their next doctors appointment for example? Or their last? Consider it carefully before you answer."
"&gt;  The brides father has begun calling me asking for more money.

I've been in the wedding party and have been best man before. If the father of the bride called me up and asked for money I'd tell him to pound sand. That is not even remotely close to normal.

&gt; His fiancé also sent me a long and expensive list of clothing I need to have fitted and purchase as a groomsman

I'm sorry what? What sort of wedding is this?"
"Maybe the reason why the bag was smaller was normal was because he smoked quite a bit of it before coming over, and then got hungry and that's why he stole that much garlic bread, in which case he would have stolen your drugs and your food.

Regardless of the reason, I would be wary of letting him in my house again. It doesn't matter what it is, if someone steals from a friend, that's a bad sign."
"Do the other people who get birthday celebrations organise them themselves or drop gentle reminders? It could be that your siblings are dropping hints all the time to your parents because they've worked out your folks are shit at remembering things.

Happy Birthday for yesterday too. I can't imagine my parents forgetting my birthday, or my brother either. But we also talk about what we're doing for the day or that kind of thing beforehand so we all know the plans."
"&gt; he wants to be able to wake up in the mornings and look at his wife and think ""damn, I did good""

Wow.

Tell him good luck with that. You deserve to hear that from someone who doesn't need to you change to achieve it."
"Plus- the sister isn’t looking out for what’s best for OP, she wants to make her own life easier and not be caught in the middle of this mess."
"""No, they lost the right to my children when they disowned me. They can't suddenly decide to rug sweep simply because now they found out about my child. They burned their bridge to me and any children I have when they couldn't be supportive parents, and the thing my child needs is those who support them, my parents have proven they aren't able to do that. Sorry, but they are not welcome around my child, and if you make any attempts to get them around me or my children I will cut you out of my life just as they did me. Period."""
"Walk way.  He wants you to be something you're not, he doesn't appreciate you as you are now.  At least he told you this now and not later."
"First: I bet she wanted to keep the convo at breakfast because she's embarrassed and not sure of what to do. Speaking as a victim of abuse: knowing that a friend saw you in a position that vulnerable, emotional, and awful is humiliating and hard. You desperately need help and you know it, but you're mortified that someone has seen you that way and wish they hadn't. 

Definitely cut off contact with B and stay away from him. Make sure J understands that you have done this and that you have no intention of being his friend or helping him, and that you want to do what you can to protect \*her\*.   


Refer her to the domestic abuse hotline and do your best to get her to go to the police, no matter how daunting that prospect is. Unfortunately, sometimes victims go back to abusers (for the very reason you already identified: he's a 'charmer' even though he's horrifically abusive), and all you can really do is just be there for her and make sure that B knows that you won't stand for this shit."
"Pretty much. Especially if his excuse for it was ""I saw a movie and did shrooms."" Neither of those things take the entire weekend, pal. 

He was either cheating and had his phone off so any inconvenient messages from OP wouldn't tip off the new woman that he had a GF, or he was on a bender with much harder drugs than he wants OP to know he took."
"Yep, I had a boyfriend who used keyloggers on his computer to get my passwords when I checked my email. When we broke up, like 5 months after we were broken up, he changed my password so I could never get back into that email. People who use tracking devices would definitely use this software."
"This but only kind of.

Choking in an abusive relationship is an indicator of “high lethality” abuse. A.K.A. It’s very very possible that this could escalate to a deadly scenario, which means every step in this situation should be taken with caution. 

Calling the cops is NOT a good idea if that isn’t what J wants. It could put her in more danger and even if it doesn’t, it may not help if she’s not ready to leave him. 

What you CAN do in this scenario is be supportive towards J. Remind her how strong she is and build her autonomy. Help her create a safety plan even if she’s not ready to leave. Encourage B to respect her boundaries if you do continue to talk to him. But do not, under any circumstances, do anything without J’s consent. She knows what’s best for her, and if she hasn’t called the cops it’s likely because it puts her in some sort of harm.

He's lying. Phones aren't going to magically install tinder during an update.
"If there's a keylogger installed, he can see this conversation. Don't procrastinate."
"The first thing I would do before any of this, is check where else OP could have been bugged. While she might trap him conversationally into admitting to the car tracker, he could be monitoring her phone, internet usage, laptop, social media messages, email, etc etc -- he could very well be aware she posted this thread. First step IMO would be to keep digging and keep observing the husband."
"This is a very important detail. If op wants to meet the sister she needs to do it in a neutral middle 
 ground. If she is still under the family influence I don’t doubt she would if pushed pass on private information."
"&gt;But her hopes do not obligate you to act. 

This is such a great line. Definitely jotting that down to use later."
"&gt; but I have told my parents no a few times before and they always ask me “why not?”  

So...this is the issue.

It sounds like they are *telling* you to watch the animals, not *asking*.  You are a 26 year old man with a wife and life of your own.  You have every right to say NO, and that be the end of it.  The fact alone that they expect an explanation out of you screams boundary issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Is pet sitting that bid of a deal?  no.  But this seems like the symptom of a much bigger problem."
Fear of Bridezilla. Behind the scenes she's likely freaking out on him about everything too.
"Yep. I picked up the ring from the jeweler, handed the box to future husband and he got down on one knee right then and there. No dinner. Just a proposal. The ""right"" way to propose is, ""Will you marry me""."
"I’m sure he knows he’s wrong when he criticizes you for not reminding him.  If he says “Why didn’t you...?” Remind him that you’re not his mother.  Tomorrow is Monday, warm him tonight that you feel stuck, you don’t want to have this fight, and ‘mom’ is taking a week off.  Spend this week doing your best to not remind him of anything, or do anything for him that he should be doing, and next week, maybe you can decide what he deserves help with, or what he can figure out on his own."
"This.
There's a difference between favoritism and not wanting a druggie around your family for several days in a row."
"&gt; She also admits that part of the reason she is so adamant about this is because a ""modern woman should not be expected to assume all household responsibilities. The husband should share these responsibilities equally"". 

Awesome, a modern household also has 2 people both working full time. She isn't. This isn't even a gender responsibility thing, if this was a woman working 50 hours and a man working part time, I would CERTAINLY expect the man to do more of the chores."
Have you called the police yet? He assaulted you and is now harassing you.
Start looking for an apartment.
"""John, I do not know how to tell you this but at my doctor's visit today, the doctor told me I am 6 weeks pregnant. We have (time left for an abortion in your area) to make a decision where we want to go from here so it's okay if you need some time to process this. """
"It's hard to believe that you have heard the full story yet.   Neither excuse if true would be a reason to not at least simply reply to a text over that time period.   But add in that he initially lied, and it makes it even more sketchy. 

I don't expect a partner to constantly check in, but not hearing anything from someone I lived with for a couple of days would be too much.  The worry and anxiety would be brutal.  I don't think you are over-reacting in the slightest.  Being upset over someone you have been living with for years disappearing with no communication for days is not a trust issue on your part."
"I agree with this. 

You ask for a magic phrase? Here it is: “change or I leave.”

Show him there could be big, real consequences if there’s no change. If even a big wake up call doesn’t work, well, then you know there’s no help."
"Thanks, I didn't even think about anything else being bugged. I don't want to become paranoid, but it's starting to set in."
"Honestly, I'd plan the meeting at least an hour from home.  You don't want ""family"" like this knowing roughly where you live -- unless you're okay when they turn up at your local supermarket or on your doorstep."
"Yeah, insisting on that is insane. I've always had the option to do my own makeup as a bridesmaid, or pay to have it done. If the bride wanted everyone to do it, she should pay herself. Also $200 is insane, I had a pretty high-end make-up artist at my own wedding and still didn't pay that for one person AS THE BRIDE. Bridesmaids should cost even less."
"I also became pregnant with an IUD before my bf and I were ready. It was horrible and felt so unfair. Remember that this isn't anyone's fault, and he loves you. Don't deal with this alone, you can get through it whatever you decide, together."
"Why did he even start dating you? You’re not some project, some fixer upper, to be improved upon. You’re someone he should be infatuated with, especially at the very beginning. Sounds like he’s always been settling..  and this is his problem 100%. I’m thinking you’re a total catch and he’s a self obsessed dud. Move on to someone who actually recognizes how amazing you are! As a former runner who’s now obsessed with lifting, I’d say that maybe someday you’ll get into lifting, or maybe not. Either way, it needs to be on your terms, your goals, your desires, and without this guy involved."
They’re confused.  The marriage is important.  The wedding is fluff.  I’d gamble they won’t last 5 years.
""" A silly example if it helps: I have taken the flack for doing my husbands laundry. Specifically, not putting things away in HIS preferred location. ""

No matter what you do it is a lose-lose for you.

You need marriage counseling very badly.  You also need counseling for yourself to boost your self-esteem and to stop being a doormat."
"The extent to which OP enabled the cycle of abuse if somewhat shocking. OP, you said you've been in an abusive relationship before. So you should understand how this goes. And you drove B back home to J?!?!?"
"It's not normal to make them pay for it though, at least not where I'm from. You either choose your wedding party's outfits and pay for them or give some guidance and let them buy their own. Choosing a load of pricey clothes and then asking people to pay isn't fair at all."
I have a macbook. Do you recommend I go to the Apple Store or do I go to a third party?
"I’d try the Apple store first. If they can’t help you, find a third party that specializes in macs. 

I truly hope they don’t find anything. But if they do, get a written record of the diagnosis to add to the photos your mechanic took. Just in case you need to take this to a lawyer."
Hmm I would honestly have an open and honest conversation and just ask if anything has changed or like where we are at since it has been almost 2 years since the ring was purchased. Even candidly I would ask like ‘do you still want to get engaged it’s kind of been a min since we bought that ring?’
"Buddy, you are delusional. You guys have only been dating a year, she treats you like shit, she's abusive, and she cheated on you. 

You have some serious issues of your own if you think you have anything ""real"" with this woman. I realize you love the drama of dating a toxic person, and you get off on the idea that ""no one understands our love"" and it's ""us against the world"", but this is ridiculous. 

Grow a spine dude, no amount of crazy sex is worth being abused and cheated on."
"And please, please, please share it on Reddit when she does!"
"Call a domestic violence shelter and get informed about what they recommend next steps should be/how you can best support her. 


Let her know that she is a worthwhile person, you are a safe person to contact, you will help her when/if she’s ready to leave. Pass along resources you got from your call to the shelter. 


You can not “make” her leave but you can support her so she knows she has an out and help when she wants to."
That type of attention and rumors isn't appropriate in the workplace. If he's innocent he needs to go to HR and report her. She can't just go around saying that she fucked someone AT work.
"Even that isn't fully necessary. My fiance proposed at home, when we were in PJs and winding down from a date night.

To me, it doesn't matter HOW he does it. It's THAT he does it."
"I saw good advice here once that said don't divide and compare work time, compare how much free time you both get.  Maybe if you show her how much free time she gets compared to you it might help her see better."
"You tell them the truth, that they were insulting and dismissive of her when they thought she was worth nothing and you will be damned if you're going to let them use her now that they want something from her. 

This isn't a hard choice.  Your friends are garbage human beings."
"Yeah no, no way would I expose my child to those assholes. It'd be one thing if they came back earnestly begging for another chance, saying they missed you and wanted to make up for cutting you out and all the missed time. Them instead coming at you like this, screaming and entitled and completely unapologetic for how hurtful they were to you, no fucking way.

Tell your sister that when they decide to be nice, non-shitty parents to you, maybe you'll consider if they've earned the privilege of meeting *your* daughter. And it's not up for discussion with your sister again."
"This definitely should have been discussed prior to your trial move-in period. Lucky for you, you still have your own place should this not work out and it's a great opportunity to work on communication. 

Sit down together and create some ground rules. You're there rent free and using the utilities, so I think it's only fair you help around the house. That being said I don't think it's fair for her to expect you to do all the work. 

The way you're thinking about this though seems a bit problematic. You say they are her dirty dishes from her breakfast, and you don't mind cleaning up after yourself as a house guest should. Your mindset isn't of accomplishing tasks as a unit, you're only thinking about yourselves as individuals who should only be responsible for your own messes. If this was really you living together it shouldn't be just about yourself. You would be doing dirty dishes for the greater good of the shared living space. Whether this means you do the dishes and she vacuums, or you both take turns doing the same chores is up to how you guys work it out between yourselves, but this is the practice for actually living and working as partners. Find something that works for you both, but you need to be doing it as a team not as individuals."
"My brother is a mechanic and he confirmed this is really common. 
That’s awful."
"&gt; My family has asked me not to do a protective order because it could ruin his position at work(hes an app developer), and potentially ruin his life.

Hey, who cares if you get beaten or killed as long as his career isn't ruined. /s

Go ahead and pursue that protective order. Also move ahead with the divorce obviously."
"I feel like he’s gaslighting you with constantly changing things up (don’t nag me, do it this way, why didn’t you remind me) and that’s abusive. If he won’t join you in therapy today learn how to communicate through this, I’d bounce."
"I had a ""friend"" like this. Knew him since middle school. When we were adults, he'd start to come over at dinner time and eat most of the food. He'd stay over some nights, and eventually I got a bill for 40 dollars worth of pay per view porn, that I know my girlfriend and I didn't order. He denied it. Eventually, he started stealing little items like headphones. Ended up having to drop him as a friend. He's abusing your friendship and treating you like his parent that will keep forgiving his trespasses. Confront him if you want, but you probably won't get much out of him."
"I think it's interesting that you seem to view you and your friend as a unit.  Everything is ""we did this"" ""our grades"" etc.  Distance would probably be good."
"You are allowed to want things. You're allowed to ask for a commitment just as much as he is. That's not being a nag, honey. That's being a human. You don't have to be nasty about asking, but you are absolutely right to talk it out."
I really like this idea. It'll prove if it's him without putting OP in any danger.
"She might already be in danger. If he was tracking her car then *he knows she went back to the shop*. I'd guess that he's going to be pretty suspicious, or at the very least he's going to have an excuse ready for it/know about of time to play dumb."
"I'm planning my wedding right now and we didn't pay a cent for the block of hotel rooms. However in blocking them off our guests get a discounted rate. There's a small clause that the rooms booked have to reach a certain dollar amount or we forfeit the discount and it's the regular rate. The discount is not big though, like 15% I think so suddenly having to pay double doesn't make sense."
"Hiya, this happened to me on my 29th birthday also! I was really hurt and super sad, I empathize with how you feel, it really sucks.

I went to my parents and I told them, clearly, unemotionally but firmly, how disappointed I was that they had forgotten and how hurtful that was. I emphasized that it was important to me that I was remembered and celebrated, and that I expected them to make it up to me the following year. I also said this to my siblings, other family members, and friends who forgot.

They definitely didn't forget the next year :) but nothing changes if you don't stick up for yourself and ask for what you need, loudly and clearly."
"Gaslighting exactly! I have found myself standing and staring at him in a complete state of shock and incredulity during every one of these episodes. I’ve even wanted to record and catalog this crap just to play it for him. He claims he never tells me the things I repeat to him. He claims I never told him things I absolutely did.  For example his mother bought our daughter a present, I put it in the closet, I told him about it. Then the next day he asks me about it, I tell him again, exactly where it is, hidden in the closet.  He does nothing with it.  Today he asks:  did I give her the present from his mom? I said no it’s in the closet. He said: you told me it wasn’t here.    

What?!?  

Almost any other statement would have made some sense but to tell me that I told him that it wasn’t even in the house?!! 

It’s all bullshit. Now, somehow, I’m the asshole because I what? Didn’t wrap it and give it to her? Didn’t write a note?! What?!?"
"First of all, his behaviour isn’t cool. He IS being a jerk and it’s ok to feel upset.


Secondly, I suspect something happened that set him off which he isn’t talking to you about. 


I had an ex who was super sweet and friendly, just playful teasing at most, etc for the first couple years of our relationship, then he started doing the same thing where he’d suddenly get grumpy and mean... and what always happened was that after a week, or a month, or whatever, he’d come out with his reason for being grumpy. 


And it was always something fucking stupid and borderline-abusive like “I saw you looking at me across the room with an angry face (so I gave you the silent treatment for an entire day)” (???????) “I found out you used tinder back when you were single (so now I’m convinced that you’re not monogamous)” (????!!) “I offered to take care of you when you were sick but you should’ve known I didn’t actually want to take care of you so you should’ve turned down my offer (so now I’m going to act like a grumpy jerk for literally 2 months straight without any explanation or rationale) ” (!!!?!!)"
I like this idea. What does he do when he's on his own? Has he ever been on his own? Sounds like he is just avoiding adulthood.
"This is not okay. Not at all okay. I am imagining what it would feel like if my boyfriend did the same thing, and I got this disgusting pit in my stomach. This doesn’t feel right, and I’m sorry, but there is no way your adult boyfriend is this oblivious. He knows it bothers you, and he’s doing it anyway, thus prioritizing her feelings over yours. He needs to create distance between him and her, and honestly that trip is a HORRIBLE idea. Maybe see if you can go too, if she shuts it down, that answers your question right there."
""" He SWEARS he definitely wants to get married. ""

He may swear it, but from his actions of having the engagement ring for 1 year and 7 months and not proposing tells a lot more.

I don't think he wants to get married."
"Yeah, chances are he's cheating but stays with you because you pay the bills."
"I remember calling my mom and saying that I was a little hurt that she’d forgotten my birthday.  Yeah, I am a grown up and shouldn’t expect a parade every year, but I had just broken up with a long term boyfriend and was a little blue.  She blew me off, explaining that she was just so *busy.*  She’d bought a car for my older brother’s birthday and was driving it 1800 miles to give it to him.  

Yeah."
"Don't move in. Tell them you're not going to pay that much rent and live separately until:

1. They lower the rent
2. You decide you want to / can afford to pay that much rent

They can't force you to live there but they also aren't obliged to offer you a free stay. If they bought it on the assumption you'd pay rent, that's on them for not checking with you first."
"OP is not the bad guy here. The fact he has been in abusive relationship is 1 of many reason he might not have reacted 'correctly'. He wants to help J and do the right thing, give him a break."
"Oddly, this philosophy saved me lots of money and waste when I applied it to clothes shopping"
"Excessive punishment against a small animal... while I don’t know the situation and your BF enough to confidently call that animal abuse, it would definitely be a HUGE red flag to me. 

I also have a cat, 2M, and if my significant other treated them that poorly and wasn’t willing to change his behavior, I would be just as mad as you. I’d probably tell them to change how they treat my cat, or move out. I don’t know if that’s right for your situation, but what your BF is doing is definitely not okay. You know your cat best and that little girl is dependent on YOU to give her a happy, safe life. Take care of yourself &amp; your kitty please! 

Food for thought.... could this be a sign of bigger issues to come? If you want a family, will your parenting styles drastically differ? Are you both really on the same page about how your future home will be structured? It sounds like there might be a bigger-picture conversation worth having here, too."
"As a couples therapist I agree with this post. I predict this marriage is headed for choppy waters. If bridezilla has such a drama problem, the only way to combat that is clear and firm boundaries."
"It's not uncommon to see men with the perspective that anything they do related to childcare is a bonus deserving of praise and recognition, whereas women are expected to take on the bulk of the work as a bare minimum.. it seems to be changing a bit, but this idea seems to have tripped up OP."
"This, 100%.  This is actually a huge pet-peeve of mine.  My immediate answer now to ""What are you doing X dates?"" is ""Why do you ask?""  While maybe not always intentional, I think it's actually kinda manipulative asking someone in such a vague way.  Like you said, it feels like a trick."
"Yeah, my husband has been tricked into helping people move with that ""hey what are you doing this day?"" Thing. He thinks they want to hang out, and they are.like ""Excellent! You can come move! See you at 10!"" Definitely give her the info."
"I'm on a full ride, which thankfully doesn't get taken away unless your GPA falls below 2.0. It's only in place for eight semesters, though, so if I wasn't able to graduate by spring 2022 I'd have to pay for it out of pocket (which is impossible, because I'm poor).

I'm not worried about not getting off of probation, since all you have to do is not fail any courses, not withdraw any courses, and not get below a 2.0 (which you can't do without failing at least one course). My concern is that I want to do *well*, not barely scrape by and graduate with a horrible GPA."
"He told me I wasn't allowed to leave with the ring because he wanted to ""propose the right way."""
"You talk about them like they 80, not 50. 


I find it hard to believe in 4 years they’ve changed this radically."
"When my now-husband and I were just dating (only together 2 months maybe) i went over to his place and saw an earring on his bathroom counter. He was like ""oh, I found this earring you left here when I was vaccuuming so I set it aside"" and I was like ummmmmmmm that is NOT my earring. He got all sheepish and was like ""oh. well. um. sorry. it must be from the last girl i dated. oops. haha. um. sorry."" And because I trusted him, I accepted that explanation. I felt awkward (so did he lol) and I did feel an initial spike of anxiety when I first realized it wasn't mine, but it dissipated rapidly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering what you mean by ""eyelash extension"" do you mean fake eyelashes, like on the sticky strip? Because a single ""eyelash extension"" is just a single synthetic lash, and could be mistaken with any short, appropriately curved hair. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think you should take my husbands approach and say ""Look, I thought it was yours because I haven't had a woman over since the last woman I dated, in December. But if it isn't yours, then it must have been left behind from her. I understand why seeing it initially made you feel anxious but it isn't fair for you to be mad at me because I didn't do anything wrong. I haven't cheated on you, and I'm not okay with you continuing to put me down and make me feel like I have something to be sorry for."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Some women enjoy when their partners feel like they are ""in the doghouse"" because they get more of the power in the relationship, more affection, reassurance, etc. So she may be dragging out (maybe even subconsciously) her problem with this and snap out of it when you express annoyance / that it is making you take the relationship less seriously."
"So, this girl barely sees her dad at all, and spends most of her time with her mom. And you are expecting a 13 year old to listen to step parent she sees for a month a year? 

I know it sounds harsh, but 13 year olds are going through an insane hormonal cycle. They struggle with processing changes to their own body and social sphere. Writing about violence? She most likely doesn't know how else to process her anger and frustration. Writing about characters that are incapable of happiness? Chances are she's struggling to be happy too. At least, I know that's what happened when I went through a ""write emo and depressive shit"" phase. 

&gt; My boyfriend gets frustrated when he gets home and we're not happy with each other and said things like ""calm down ladies"" which I think both undermines my authority to tell her to not behave this way and diminishes my very real frustrations about her interrupting my ability to do business.

You are the partner of a parent she barely sees. She doesn't even see her own father as a 'figure of authority'. You're not authority. You're the person who lives with her dad. I get that you care about her - dental care and hygiene. But at some point, you have to care less. It's not your responsibility to parent her, it's your boyfriend's. 

If you have to work from home, have you considered placing a lock on your office door or something? You're working. You're not goofing off. You're allowed to have peace and quiet. Is it possible that you can pick up your workstation (laptop?) and work in a library or shop or something instead? Leave the parenting stuff to your boyfriend, forcibly. But you being interrupted from work is not a parenting thing, it's a basic human respect thing. Set boundaries with her and say, ""No, I can't talk right now, I'm working. I'll talk to you at lunch time at around noon."" She throws an angry fit? That's nice. You ignore her like a toddler. Surprisingly, even at this age you have to ignore the hissy fits."
"I would tell him about it and act scared like some stranger put it on there. Tell him you want call the police and then gauge his reaction. If he didn’t put it in your car, he’d insist that you call the cops. But if he discourages you in any way, then that makes him highly suspicious. ALSO, I really hope a stranger didn’t put this on your car."
"&gt;Edit 2: I asked him to open the app and he said no because I should 'trust him'. Then said that there would be conversations on there from before we met where he is flirting with other women that I might see and get upset about.

&gt;Then said that he had opened the app and there was nothing on there since he had deleted his account years ago. FFS

But he wouldn't let you see it?  I wasn't on board with all of the other people here who jumped to conclusions, but I mean....FFS sounds about right."
His panties are on fire from lying
I can't imagine any parent forgetting their child's birthday.
"&gt;&gt; heart-to-heart

I'd just say ""it has become too expensive"" - perhaps y'all could also have a small local get ceremony or reception for the family that can't afford to go to the destination."
"Jesus Christ Marie, they're minerals!!

Thanks for the laugh"
"I would also add, it's highly unlikely an 18 year old OWES their parents anything. They were legally obligated to provide for you, they chose to bring you into this world and maintain custody of you."
"&gt;First: I bet she wanted to keep the convo at breakfast light because she's embarrassed and not sure of what to do.

Also, this is horrible but I have a friend in an abusive relationship, who's had friends ditch her after they witnessed a fight. ""I don't want to deal with that *drama*"", they think. She may be afraid that OP will ditch her, too, or take the husband's side."
"I wouldn't deal with any of this if I were you.

Seems like you need to have a talk with your brother about this whole situation. Keep the texts his fiancee has sent you and let him read them. Give him an idea where you are coming from and that YOU should not be paying $1000 for his wedding. You are a groomsmen, not his piggy bank. When I went to my friends wedding I stepped down from the wedding party due to external factors, but his fiancee was going to pay for my suite and everything else that I was to have for the wedding.

You could always step down from the wedding party and just attend if that cuts down the drama from your side. Tell them you aren't going to donate any money and that your wedding gift is all they get from you. If they give you any more crap, just decline the invite.

It's up to you and how your brother responds in all fairness. Best of luck to you and I hope things work out for you and your family."
"Take the job.  You applied because you wanted to try it out, do that.  

Also, I doubt that you are  likely to have a ""happy couply life"" with someone who feels entitled to set an arbitrary limit on your contact with your mom -- and I say that as someone who thinks that far too many people in their twenties are too tethered to their parents."
"Jesus Christ something is wrong with your family. 

I’m guessing your husband is not the first toxic person they’ve made excuses for."
"All I could think of reading this was how badly the two of you need marriage counseling.

Yes you made mistakes and honestly, yes, your wife is justified in being resentful about what’s happened with both children. (Waking up your pregnant, working wife for baby duty?? Really??).  Now neither of you is sure how you can make this right, or if you even could make it right. We don’t have the full story here and it’s hard to tell what you’re hoping to glean from feedback to your one-sided account. Proof that internet strangers think you’re right? Validation? 

It’s very telling that she regrets having kids with you and yet you think these kids are the best thing to ever happen to you. Of course that’s how you feel, you’re not doing the lion’s share of the labor. Go to marriage counseling. Even if your marriage doesn’t make it you two still need to learn how to co-parent without ripping each other apart in front of your kids."
"I was also in this situation with my husband. It has gone down a lot to ""I occasionally have to run the show"". My recommendation is to get into Therapy and explain you are at your wits end and refuse to be mom anymore. You are mom to your kids and only them. I stopped doing everything laundry, cleaning, cooking, you name it I stopped doing it. Then I started to hear hey why's the house dirty? Hey why is there no dinner? My responses on because I'm not cleaning or cooking any more. Take the time you would be doing this stuff to relax or chill with the kids. Moral of the story if you don't clean for a week to teach him a lesson no one will die and it will get the point across. Stop being his mom let him fail then schedule a chore board with the list of things each family member needs done that week. This way you aren't constantly nagging and you can hold him accountable."
"Well, there’s a lot to unpack here. From genetic sexual attraction phenomena, to what are clearly severe mental disorders with this Katie person. If I had to make an educated guess, seems like OCD, eating disorders, cluster B personality disorders, and maybe even some kind of Psychosis are on the table.

My advice is to seek therapy for yourself, and consider an intervention if possible. Your Mom is neck deep in a codependent, extraordinarily obsessive and fucked up situation. I think you could sincerely benefit from professional support and guidance, as you cannot possibly untangle this mess alone. Don’t forget to take care of yourself, too. Watching loved ones nose dive into treacherous territory is awful, and you can’t help if your own emotional needs are neglected. Plus, it could be that you are unable to fix this, and will need an entirely different kind of support to accept and cope with that. 

I’m so sorry for what you’re going through."
"You are focused on the wrong thing.  One month is *nothing* for this kind of grief.  It's totally normal to be disengaged from life in general at this point.  Your husband understands that more than you do.  

&gt;I don't feel like I'm ready at the moment for therapy or grief counseling.  

Grief counseling is exactly what you need - just listening to the experiences of others in a group setting will make a difference.   Group counseling of this sort is usually free or very low cost."
Yup - the most expensive wedding I was ever in lasted 11 months.  I was so mad I had to spend so much and they failed to make it a year.
Oh my god. I dont even know what to say this is the first one that has left me speechless...you're in my thoughts and god speed OP
"From what you've written here, I think she's given you all the information she has and honestly I don't think she's really that out of line for being annoyed with this. 

Your parents *are* kind of acting entitled to your time, and you *are* prioritizing their convenience over your wife's. You don't mind doing this for your parents as you love the animals too, but you're not taking your wife's feelings into account.

When you agree to petsit for your folks for multiple days at a time, you're also assuming that your wife agrees to take full responsibility for *your* house and pets for those days, as well as agree to forfeit any plans with you that might have come up, and agree to spend a few nights alone. You're deciding that stuff for her. You feel like it's unreasonable for her to tell her you can't help your parents in this way, but you don't consider that it might not be reasonable for you to unanimously decide she's on her own for a few nights with no room for compromise or discussion.

I think you guys need to reach a compromise where either the animals come stay with you, or you don't petsit every single time your parents ask. If they ask why not, the answer isn't ""Alice says I can't,"" the answer is ""that weekend isn't convenient for us."""
"&gt;As someone who worked in the wedding industry for years let me just tell you that this is a very very bad sign for what their marriage is going to be like.

I was gonna tell OP that there is a very good chance that this woman won't be his sister in law but for a few years so he shouldn't sweat alienating her and her family and that his brother will come around and understand if not at first, but eventually"
"Even if there was an un-disown option, yelling about OP being a monster is not the way to go about things. Making the reason to reconnect being about the child/children to be is not the way to go about things. (The family isn't even making this out to be about the child/children. They are making it about them and how others see them.)"
"If you ask me, your courthouse wedding is a great opportunity to explain to Anna exactly why John won't be included in certain gatherings. This is 100% on him. He expressed disapproval about your plans, right to your face, of course he doesn't get an invite. Any sane, reasonable person would not extend an invite to someone who directly insulted you and your wedding plans to your face. There's no defending it. He can't get upset about it, because he's the one who ruined his chances at getting an invite."
"Yeah, I've heard of deals where if the bridesmaids get their makeup done then the bride's is free, so she may be using them for the discount."
"Put your foot down. You already have a place and if you wanted another, you'd be the one who would pick it out, not your girlfriend (of just *one year*)'s mother. If they're rich they can afford to let her live there for cheap or free, they can find a roommate for her, they can rent it out themselves, or sell it. It seems to me like her mother is controlling and she will dislike you standing up to her, but you have to or you will have her walking all over you for the rest of your relationship. And if that doesn't work for your gf, I'm sorry but I'm not sure that your gf has your best interests at heart in that case."
"If you're on your phone or computer now, he may already know you know about the tracker on your car by reading this post, and is planning a cover story."
"Yeah. Especially the bit about mom giving up with fashion “about fifteen years ago.” So... when she was 35? It sounds to me like the parents have always been like this, and OP needed some space from them to see it properly."
This is the best thing I've read all day
"Tell your sister where exactly in your parents disowning you did you fuck up? Not refusing to be gay? Not pursuing an incredible opportunity for your career that allowed you to pay for your sister's bills? Where exactly did you do anything anywhere close to what your parents did? Ask her why she should be obligated to expose your daughter to such people and where exactly is the middle you can meet if your parents have apparently done nothing to show they are willing to move and instead claim rights over the daughter of someone they disowned.

Tell her your rules for meeting your daughter and your wife. They are non negotiable and she can't bring you and your parents together while they are unwilling to change."
Never get involved in other people's relationships like this. Acting like a spokesperson for your entire side of the family is a bad idea. Stick to your own personal grievances.
It's not about the gaming...clearly.
Do you want a guy who treats you like a project and a trophy? That's what you have to ask.
Keep the money and put it towards your knee.
Where I live (CA) it’s common for the wedding party to pay for their own clothes and I’ve actually never heard of it being the bride and grooms responsibility but I do know brides and grooms who do it to be nice and certainly when I got married we considered the cost for the wedding party and their budgets.
"In the US, the bridal party typically pays for their own dresses. That said, I paid for my bridal party's dresses as a thank you. They paid for their own hair and makeup though (I told them it was optional, but they all did it)."
Stealing anything from a friend is bad enough. But like...come on. No friend would steal garlic bread. You do not take someone's garlic bread. There is a basic moral code and it goes like this: Don't murder people and don't take people's garlic bread.
"Ah, so it's a little less intense. Your dog GOES to a friend's place, meaning minimal interruptions to their lives. And your parents don't sleep at your place. So why can't you do the same? Just strop by by for walks and feedings? I know you mentioned the older dog who has trouble with stairs, but that's what baby gates are for, no? And the dog somehow survives during the day without you there, so is it really truly necessary for you to do overnights?"
Your dad is trying to ruin you financially and creditwise before you even have a chance to be an adult. Make sure that you have access to a credit report of some sort and that you are paying attention to your credit score. This is not the last time that he will try to fuck you over financially and you need start putting more boundaries between you and your dad. He's toxic and this will not get better.
"&gt;Do you think Michelle is interested in my 93-year-old father for his good looks

No. She's interested in attaching herself to him as much as possible before he dies so she can live a cushy life using his money."
"&gt; Are birthdays just something that naturally falls to the wayside as you get older? 

In some families they can be. But your parents still celebrate your siblings' birthdays so obviously something else is going on here. Either they somehow got the impression you don't want them to acknowledge your birthday or they are shitbags.

Have they shown favoritism to your siblings in the past? Excluded you in other ways?"
I worry you may have a keylogger on whatever devices he has access to. Are you typing this on a shared computer?
Sounds like their final payment is due and they're out of money.
"Go through with the protective order as soon as possible.  What he said he did violates so much of your privacy.  Not letting you leave the house?  Well that's abusive behavior.

I don't know how he's been with you in the past but I can't imagine he hasn't found his way into every crevice of your personal life from the beginning.  I don't know why he admitted it now but at minimum there's something very wrong with him in terms of insecurities.  At most, he's got a sick infatuation with invading every last intimate detail of your life and who knows, you might not be the only one.  I don't think you know how disturbing his behavior could potentially be.  If he knows everything you've ever ""posted"" it probably means he read every message you typed to anyone, regardless of how private it was.  

You need to get that protective order regardless of what your family says.  I don't think they truly understand the depth of the violation of your privacy really was."
"You leave and you take your belongs back home with your parents. Get a trusted male friend, or several, and get your shit gone. Block him on everything and give him no explanation. Let him deal with the new apartment. If he doesn't want it then the complex will just keep your deposit since you haven't even moved in yet."
"This has nothing to do with whether or not you ever asked your GF to contribute to rent at your current place. Put that aside. It's irrelevant. You didn't ask her to contribute. That's done.

Now, she has a place her mother has purchased for her, and she is asking you to move in and her mother (the landlord)'s expectation is that you contribute.

You are right to point out this is a raw deal and that you didn't agree to it. And yo can say No, you won't move in under those terms.  And saying No will have consequences for your relationship.

Honestly, this is more than a bit of a red flag in regards to your girlfriend. She should have discussed this earlier and more thoroughly with you, and she should have discussed things like your budget or your preferred areas if she had an expectation or wish that you'd move into a place her mother was going to purchase. The fact that she didn't think to include in that process is very concerning and frankly, a very immature."
"Research coordinator with experience working with GBM patients for 2+ years. It may also be his tumor that's causing the behavioral changes, it could be his medications. Is he on any steroids as well?"
"Or he did more or less exactly what he told OP eventually but was ridiculously immature about just doing whatever he wanted without consequences.

  
Either way, sounds like this dude doesn't want a partner. He is living the single lifestyle."
"This is such a kind, compassionate, and good response"
"&gt;If I were you I'd say to your sister she can visit you on her own. I don't see why she would have to hide it from them - they're just not invited. But that you getting in contact with the rest of your family is not up for debate. See how she responds to that and if she respects it.

Depending on the attitude of the parents, sister's visit might be dangerous, as they can press her to find out address and arrive on their own. Then you will have to call the cops."
THIS RIGHT HERE! He probably has your social u/plamebay because he's your dad. He can open it in your name without your consent if you don't freeze your credit.
"He's ignored every single boundary you've laid out for him, and you want to be with a selfish guy like this WHY? He's already emotionally cheating, and it sounds like chances are he will physically cheat... separate rooms or not they will still be together in the same city far, far away from you. Their relationship has gone too far and I think it's clear that 1) she doesn't have any boundaries, any normal girl would understand this guy is TAKEN and not be so manipulative and high-maintenance and 2) your boyfriend is choosing her feelings over yours.

I felt a little icky just reading your post, I would be so heart-broken if this was my boyfriend. Stop trying to be the Cool Girlfriend, please, for your own sake. It's clear you're not happy with their friendship but you keep saying things like ""I don't want to be controlling"". It's NOT controlling to not want your boyfriend to call another girl 2-5 times a DAY. It's not controlling to not want your boyfriend to share a bedroom with a women you (and he!) barely knows on a trip. This whole trip is a horrible idea and sounds like it's the beginning of the end of your relationship."
What happened to getting help from her family? They are not mentioned despite the fact that both of you moved to be closer to them.
"&gt;look at his wife and think ""damn, I did good"".

My husband was crazy attracted to me when we met.  When I gained weight.  When I got hugely pregnant.  When I lost weight and had stretch marks.  Now that I am getting some 'laugh lines'.  In fact, when I said wrinkles, he insisted on calling them laugh lines.  When I say I have a grey hair, he insists that it is silver.

My self esteem matters more to him than the size of my ass.  I am nothing special OP.  You can find that."
"I agree with everything but first steps... first steps should be making someone you trust fully aware of this shit and have them give you friendly phone calls to make sure all is good.  Or better yet, they are doing a weird surprise visit tomorrow!  Make sure you have someone who knows before confronting and digging...  at least my 2 cents."
"Klingon style

The fact that he's not already doing that when he sees the OP is awful. She definitely deserves better than this loser.
"Why the fuck are your friends so obsessed with determining if she is a liar or not? Why are they following her Instagram so closely? And is Lex trying to validate herself by putting this stuff on Instagram or is she just sharing more about her life in general? 

Your friends are jerks and you are telling them too much."
"If it's going to be anyone's decision to take you off a prescription medication it should be whoever prescribed it to you in the first place, not your mother. It must be awful to be growing up in this toxic environment. How does your dad feel about it all?"
"This is a really balanced and logical answer, and I just want to thank you for answering. This is exactly what I need right now. Emotions are running high but I value this relationship and I don’t want to just go scorched earth.   
  
Thank you. I hope you and your wife are well."
Do you live in an apartment/duplex or otherwise share laundry with someone? I've found my roommate's hair literally in my butthole due to it getting in the dryer and onto my clothes.
Stop talking back? That’s not how adults talk to each other. These people sound CRAZY.
You feel better because there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  You have hope now that this girl is at least interested in being your friend and possibly more.  You and her are in the same spot coming out of relationships so she knows you can relate to where you are right now.
"This.  If they were interested in your welfare they would treat you with respect.  They are interested in your daughter for all the wrong reasons.  Kudos to you for being strong, recognizing the situation for what it is, and moving forward with your best life.  Toxic people rarely change and you don't need that kind of poison.  You can certainly be supportive for your little sis without any parental interaction."
"Honestly, I'd be frank with your sister. She's not at fault here, and likely just doesn't understand the severity of all this. Straight up tell her why you left (or, more specifically, why your family left you) and ask her what a good compromise is. Don't be afraid to tell her that her compromise is bad if it is.

At 25, she either knows the whole truth and needs you to sternly tell her the reality, or her parents withheld all the important stuff and she needs you to tell her to truth.

&gt; Still, from someone who's not intimately tied up in this mess, am I being unfair to my parents? Should I hear them out?

No, they hate you and all of your life choices. You getting a second daughter didn't change any of that."
" At some point, I will either have to pick my girlfriend or my parents. 

No, stop viewing this as binary to this instance.  It is a much larger issue: who determines your life choices.

You can live your life as you want, and establish your independence. That means your choices are guided by your wants, needs, and preferences.  On your parent's side of things, your parents can participate in that life as much--or as little---as they like.  They may not like all your choices, but you cannot give them a unilateral veto right---that is bad for you and them, in the long run.

If they start to demand compliance with their wished, you are free to nod, smile, thank them for their concern, and then say, ""No."" Then you live with the choices they make in response, good or bad.  You can simply tell them that you love them, want them to be happy, and hope to include them in your life. But if they opt out of that, or seek to impose punishments for lack of compliance, well, you will likely be sad about their choices, but you will not change yours in response.

And then remind them that their grandchildren will be your children. Given that fact, they should seek a better relationship with you, not a lessened one."
"As the dad of a 13yo, she sounds like.... a typical 13yo. And guess what? They almost always outgrow it in a few years. It's just a matter of whether you can accept and tolerate it or not"
"&gt;Your brother and his fiance should have had a conversation with your parents about costs and how much they were willing to contribute before they decided on a venue.

Absolutely. This wedding was added onto an already existing family reunion on my brother's fiance side, so while they've been planning this for years we had no say in the venue or location.

The brides father expected my parents to pay over $5k, which really isn't possible. It just seems ridiculous to me to be spending so much, which would be their decision to make if it was funded by the couple. When my mother asked why the wedding was so expensive, her father told her to ""stop talking back."" Great right?"
"Yeah I don't understand this at all. I just got married, and the thought of my father having to speak to my husband's brother about anything, ever, let alone money changing hands between them, is very strange."
yeah like a cafe/restarmurand like 100km away from your actuall livingplace
"Ding ding ding. OP seems to avoid every post that mentions his parents may be asking too much or trying to assess whether or not they ask more of him than just pet sitting. But this language stood out to me, too."
"I have yet to hear of someone whose life was “ruined” by one protective order. 

Even if it is, this was *not* a one-off mistake. Your husband deliberately and systematically violated your privacy and your trust, and intentionally frightened you. He has thoroughly earned some consequences. Get your lawyer on the phone and get yourself to a judge. This isn’t about “hurting” him (although let’s note that he clearly has no problem with hurting *you*), this is about protecting *yourself* from someone who is engaging in scary and intimidating behavior. He is not trustworthy and you need to start a paper trail in case he escalates his behavior."
"&gt;I am losing weight, dressing better, exercising and getting into his hobbies. We are spending time together in the evenings and taking a day off from work to spend together in a couple of weeks.

You're doing great, keep doing your best ! Good luck !"
"&gt; BF says that I'm a terrible person for ""victim-blaming"" him.

What a dumbass. He is not the victim in this situation. Apparently he thinks that cats are the same as dogs. Why doesn't he listen to you, the person who actually knows something about your own pet? Is he always that disrespectful towards you? Does he always dismiss your opinion so easily?

&gt; how do I help him understand

What do you mean ""help him understand""? It's not hard to understand. I can't fathom this level of dumbassery and I'm not sure how to 'help' a person this willfully ignorant. 

I think you're majorly underreacting. If anyone ignored everything I said and treated my cat like that there would be hell to pay, that's for sure. The poor baby, constantly getting harassed in her own home and then being locked up all day for no reason. It would be a dealbreaker to me. It's not just about the cat being hurt, it's about being so arrogant that he thinks he knows better than you about something he literally knows nothing about. I am baffled on how to fix that level of disrespect, to be honest. Don't leave your kitty alone with him again please."
"I see both sides here. You don’t think it’s a big deal - it really isn’t. But she sees it as your parents assuming you will do this - and they do assume.

Is it the act of you dogsitting or the feeling of imposition that is bothering her?"
"I agree with this, but you should also talk to your mother and sister and make sure you're all on board about possibly skipping the wedding. That way, you have permission to act as a spokesperson and your other relatives have a head's up in case this causes an even bigger storm."
"It looks like your relationship with your brother is already taking a lot of hits because of tensions with his fiancee and her family. Before you decide not to go, you can contact your brother directly and explain your financial concerns. If he is receptive and is willing to work with you, it may be worth it to come for his sake, but it doesn't seem like this is going to be a happy marriage, or even a fun wedding."
It's only been 2 months of grieving. That's not that long. She's going to be depressed. She should see someone though because that level of drinking can be addictive.

"I don't think she's heard the real story either. Seeing a movie does not take 3 days. I am not an expert on drugs, but I am also skeptical that taking psychedelics ate up his entire weekend as well. I believe he did both those things, the drugs and the movie, but I doubt that's *all* he did."
"Please be sure this isn’t an ectopic pregnancy. They are extremely common with IUDs, and are *very* dangerous for the woman."
If you don't tell him you run the risk of someone finding out and the possibility of him being told by a friend or family which will more then likely humiliate him. It would better if you just let him know that you had been in the videos and stress that you were young and it was way before you two had met. It may be hard but its way better then him finding out on his own or someone telling him.
"Sounds like he is depressed. It also sounds like he doesn’t want to get better. 

How much money does he have? 

I would suggest you start charging him rent. Like 200-300 dollars a month something where he will need to start earning money. At least something to make him start earning money. 

Or you can ask him to go back to school. 

The other option is to kick him out. Sometimes that’s a good kick in the pants to show him he can’t just leech his whole life."
It’s possible to break a lease. Try calling the landlord or whoever is in charge of the building and explain the situation. I feel like the worst thing that could happen is they’ll charge you a fee. Your safety and well-being is 1000 times more important than the repercussions of breaking a lease. Call a friend or family member and ask them to help you move your stuff somewhere safe. Get as far away from this guy as possible.
"You need to try for better dates. They don't need to be trips out on the town, but they need to be times you reconnect. That means no phone, focusing on each other. They don't need to be long. Check out the books 8 Dates or The Relationship Cure by Gottman to find some terrific research based tops on connecting. The Gottman website is also helpful."
"If I were in that position I wouldn't invite her home in the first place. Only meet up with her in a public place, she can easily book a hotel room for a couple days. Meeting in a place that is not your home not only doesnt give away too much private information, it also gives you the opportunity to leave at any point you start feeling uncomfortable."
"You are way under-reacting to the fact that he disappeared for 48 hours?!? Didn't bother to send a text saying, hey I'm not kidnapped or dead in 48 HOURS?? That is INSANE. He just let you work yourself into a frenzy for 2 entire days. The lack of consideration for you here is appalling, and that's not even taking into consideration he was probably doing much worse than he is letting on. Girl you need to get out of your lease and away from this deadweight."
"&gt;.Problem is, my sister thinks I'm being mean.

Your sister is pressuring you out of self-concern, though, not out of concern for you or your family. You aren't being unfair to your parents *at all*. Your family is unfair to you, including your sister. She obviously doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand what they've done to you."
"Honestly OP should just go to the police, tell them everything and ask them what they can do to check her devices for tracking applications.  

Depending on where she lives, all of this is illegal."
"This comment is fantastic. Not only was there no apology, but the social media response from family shows OP that she made the right choice then and now. 

A contrite and remorseful mother maybe should have sent a private message through social media expressing sorrow and regret at the shattered relationship and plead a chance to heal the breach. Instead OP got attacked for not sharing her daughter with the family. 

Pass."
OPs situation sounds like an out of the norm nightmare but I’ve been in 3 weddings and had to pay for my own (pre selected) dress and shoes every time. Maybe it’s regional or by how wealthy the engaged couple is but I think it’s more common to have to pay your own way.
"Exactly, actions have consequences. He admitted to placing software on two phones in order to track their whereabouts and conversations. The protective order is necessary. Honestly, he should face consequences for his malicious actions."
"If your kids really do mean the world to you,  you won't allow them to grow up in such a dysfunctional enviroment. They are gonna grow up to be all sorts of fucked up seeing the relationship between the two of you,  seeing their mother always drunk and their father unhappy and being walked all over by his cheating gf,  that's the shit that stays with your whole life,  that's the stuff that later prevents you from being a healthy functional individual capable of forming healthy relationships with other people. If you can't kick her out,  just take the kids and go somewhere safe,  she's not your responsibility,  but your kids are.  There is always a way out of shitty situations,  but it's  not always easy to do the right thing so those who didn't deserve it don't have to suffer. Your kids didn't deserve this,  they need to be your priority."
This. They are absolutely trying to take financial advantage of your family. Trying to push off costs onto you when those costs are not your responsibility. I'd put my foot down right now especially about money unless you want them to be after you and your family for it constantly because reasons. Also r/justnofamily and r/justnofil can offer more experienced insight and support with this sort of issue
Proceed to call the police and get the fuck out of your relationship.
"&gt; He always tells me ""just go along with what she says if you don't want to get attacked"".

Just so you know -- that *is* condoning it.   He says he disapproves of your mom's abusive behavior, but he's coaching you to put up with it.

If your father didn't condone your mom's behavior, he'd be challenging it -- and if necessary, that includes getting a divorce.

Your father is part of the problem here."
"Tell him about it before he meets them (and any other time he is about to meet one of your previous partners).  This is common courtesy and also the only way forward if you want a happy honest relationship.  Yes telling him might cause some issues, but the alternative is lying (by omission) and hoping you don't get found out.


The big advantage you have is you can plan out what you want to say ahead of time.  Give him context to your decisions so he can hopefully better understand.  Also be prepared to realize his responses are also valid feelings and he may be upset or confused.  Be empathetic to where he is coming from and hopefully you can get through it together, but you both might need to compromise a bit.

Good luck."
"For friends, probably. But a brother you otherwise didn't have issue with before this? I would say a chance of telling him the truth is deserved. 

And if he blows up, same difference and you know you at least tried."
"You’re being heard and supported emotionally, which has a profound impact on mental and emotional health. Also, you have feelings for her and the world isn’t totally ending and the glimmer of something new is powerful stuff. Just take it easy. Listen to her experiences as well. Take the time to connect before jumping into anything."
"Agreed. I think this is the part that shows he isn't really the ""otherwise great"" guy OP says he is. If my partner dropped off the grid for 24 hours and I had no ability to reach him, I would have filed a police report. By day 2, I would have called every hospital for miles and be begging for his return on the evening news. Because there's no way he would do that to me if he had the power not to. 

The fact that OP *didn't* do that suggests that there's something about this guy that made her feel, on some level, like he might be totally fine. That this was just a thing he was doing for his own reasons, and she hadn't been clued in. Unbelievably cruel, as you say. If some part of her suspected this,  now she knows it. If he can't acknowledge how fucked up this is to do in the first place (nevermind telling some totally impluaisble lie in an attempt to get sympathy rather than the anger he so richly deserves) it's time to go."
"I think this is the perfect thing for OP to ask of her BF.

If this really is a lie, he should be all for reporting her - like you said, it's extremely inappropriate to make up lies to your coworkers about hooking up with another coworker in the office.

On the other hand, if the BF hems and haws and tries to rationalize why he shouldn't tell HR...maybe there's some truth to the matter. Because if it did happen, of course he wouldn't want to tell HR (not only would it be a false accusation, but if HR finds out he had sex in the office, and then he too would face reprimand)."
"Don't fuck each other.

Well, OK, maybe you can fuck each other.

Just be careful.

You crazy, post-breakup, emotionally vulnerable, kids."
"I was just in my friend's wedding, we got our hair and makeup done at a nice spa and only paid $150 for both"
"Yes. 100%. That piece of shit needs to be outed. If she never finds out about it, and they end up divorcing, she's going to blame herself and wonder what SHE did wrong. She's better off knowing and then hopefully moving onto someone actually worth her time and love.

So sorry this happened to you, the same goes for you. You deserve someone who won't throw away a marriage for a high school crush. Stay strong, there are good people out there."
This whole wedding is bizarre and tacky. OP and his family is best just slowly sidestepping away from it. I got married last year and could not even imagine my dad calling *anyone* for money to pay various aspects of the wedding. W...T...F...???
"&gt; “Dude, make better life choices.”

That'll never work. IME, people set in their ways don't change unless *they* want to, not their friends. The only think OP can do is prioritise her time to her grades and not to her friend."
"I have seen many reddit posts lately where couples decide to have children, thinking it will be ‘easy’, or ‘cute’, or that it can fix bad relationships. In reality, becoming parents are incredibly hard. Standing at the hospital, ready to go home with a new person, a human you now have to keep alive, is terrifying. What do you do? How do you do it? What if something happens? I have never been so scared of anything in my life, as when I took my son home and realized that ‘oh... I don’t know how to do this’. 

I can only speak for myself here: my ex was so happy when I became pregnant. He told everyone at work immediately, he cheered, he was so happy! That quickly soured when I got sick at 8 months pregnant. He didn’t want to take care of me, he didn’t want to come to the hospital. He didn’t bring me flowers. 

I asked him what he expected from fatherhood. He told me he was happy we were having a son, because what he pictured in his head was ‘taking his son on hikes, playing football in the back yard’. His expectations were not set in reality; they were fleeting dreams of a 10-year old. He didn’t consider much what would be needed to GET his son to ten years old.

So happened what had to happen - he disengaged as soon as the baby was born. He said he ‘didn’t like it, because it was stupid, and couldn’t understand what he was trying to do, and just cried and ate all day long’. I became the sole carer of the baby. I did everything. I was with the baby 24/7, feeding him, changing him. I walked around with him for hours every night to get him to sleep. My boyfriend would look at him with disgust, or contempt, or even jealousy - because I was giving the baby all my attention.

I was a wreck. I slept when the baby slept, a stolen hour here and a 10 minute nap there. I breasfed, so I felt like a milk cow. The baby had colic, and cried all day and night. I had no support system, and my boyfriend didn’t help at all, so I felt so lonely and isolated. It led to resentment - I resented my boyfriend for leaving me to raise our baby alone. I resented my baby for being a baby. I wanted to give up. I wanted to break up with my boyfriend, because he’d lost my trust (how could I trust him to be a life partner if he just ‘disappeared’ when things got difficult? If anything worse happened, would he just do what he wanted to and not worry about anyone else again?). 

When my son was 5 months old, I talked to my SIL, who also had a son a few years older than mine. She was a single mother, and had also been alone. She told me that when she was sleep deprived and sad, she had ‘wanted to chuck her baby out a window so he’d stop crying’. That was the turning point for me. I realized that 1) many people were having difficulties when their children were babies, and 2) I didn’t have to be alone with my problems. I reached out to a therapist, and started going regularly. She opened my eyes to a lot of realities, and gave me tools to help me communicate. 

I had some long, hard talks with my boyfriend. He knew he had been leaving me with all the responsibility, but didn’t have the maturity, or - to be honest - the willingness to change. We broke up. 

You have the willingness to change. You want to fix things. Was it hard on your wife being alone with the first baby? Yes. Does she resent you? Yes. But is she willing to go to counseling with you, so that you can both learn new tools for communication? If she is, then that is a huge positive, and there’s a real chance you two can work it out."
"Also, I have to add, if he uses ""busy at work"" as an excuse now, he'll use in throughout the entire marriage. Trust me."
"&gt;If you have to work from home, have you considered placing a lock on your office door or something?

This isn't a real solution. Boyfriend needs to reduce his hours while he has his daughter or find her something to do at home or out of home. OP needs to get her boyfriend to parent."
"who does your husband think he is, DEA agent hank schrader?"
"I had a horrible boss once. On my first day, she put me on tasks I had not been trained in, and berated me and screamed at me when I couldn’t complete the tasks to her satisfaction. I cried every day, both on the job and after. I was replaceable, she was not.

So I started ‘killing her with kindness’. When she berated me, I plastered on a smile, said I’d do better, and asked her loads of questions because she’d been in the field for decades. When she made snarky comments to my face, I solemnly agreed that I did indeed have some shortcomings, and asked her how she would suggest I better them.

I never came off fake, although I was dying inside (I did NOT like her, and to be honest, she frightened me). I just treated her really well, complimented her and asked tons of questions.

So one day I’m eating lunch by my self, and my boss sits down opposite me with her lunch. She starts small-talking. I was stunned, and I’m surprised noone noticed my mouth was agape in perplexed confusion. Turns out, I had gotten on such good terms with her, she now considered me a great employee. 

Now, many years later I get a different boss on a different job. She is nice on the surface, pleasant. After a few days, she fires the first person. After a month, she has fired 3 others. She is manipulative, she lies to corporate, she spreads rumors about all her colleagues and ‘friends’. She tries to break up friendships, and talks behind everyones back. One of the employees tries to ‘kill her with kindness’. The boss is receptive - she takes her for lunches. She buys her an expensive gift. Then she reports the gift as stolen and the employee gets fired on suspicion of theft and other lies corporate has been fed.

My point is, every situation and every person has to be handled differently. Some respond to kindness, some to you keeping your head down, some doesn’t respond to anything and will be an ahole no matter what you do. Gauge the situation. Does keeping your distance work? Great! Does she respond to kindness? Great! 

No matter what, I’d very discreetly keep a record of ‘situations’. Be careful it’s not seen or found by others. Write down date, what happened. Keep a list. Make sure you don’t cause any drama. If HR needs to be involved again, you will have a list of everything that has been happening. 

Best wishes!"

Tell him that you are going to take the car back to the shop because the alignment feels odd.  Then check to see if the tracker is gone the next day. Then see if it magically reappears.
"Honestly it sounds as if she's asking for a therapist rather than boyfriend, it's highly unreasonable for you to provide for her emotional needs 24/7. Does she have a history of self-harm? Is there someone close to her you can talk about her behaviour with? I personally would end the relationship and be firm with it, as in ""friendship"" isn't an issue until she completely gets over you - ie. block her if necessary. Be reasonable about this as well, carefully provide an explanation and hope she listens. If she lashes out again, at least you'll know you tried your best and that you need to consider yourself too."
r/bridezillas looks forward to this.
"Err I'm gonna say~ no. My girlfriend is a pain in the ass. And sometimes I can use a little brake. But when I'm not with her, I miss her. And (98% of the time) when I'm with her im loving it.

It shouldn't have to be a chore. When I do something that makes my girlfriend happy, I'm not thinking of doing it ""because she's my girlfriend"". I do it because I enjoy making this person happy and smile"
"It isn't fair or normal for someone to eat most of the food, make more money and insist on splitting groceries 50/50. Can you buy your own food for yourself and have him buy his own food (he sounds like an ass, though)."
"So uh, where was he staying while supposedly on psychedelics? And what was his excuse for not texting you AT ALL before, during, or after this experience? 

Because I still don’t think you’re getting the truth. Unless your husband took a MASSIVE dose of whatever he was on, he was perfectly capable of texting you the next day, at minimum. He is still lying to you and you absolutely need to make a bigger stink about this. Disappearing on you for days with no contact is bad enough, but the lying on top of that puts your marriage in critical condition."
"Their life is veeeeeeery rarely ruined, as well. But women are killed by guys like this every day. OP, don't let him ruin your life. By 'ruin' I mean 'take'."
"&gt; knowing him i would not be surprised if he literally stalked me around my local (community hub pub thing) causing aggro

Sounds like even if you do give him the tenner back, he'll just find something else to ""cause aggro"" about.

I'd file a police report for the *physical assault* first and foremost, then block him from your life. If he starts harassing you, add it to your report, and see if you can get a restraining order (or equivalent, for your area)."
"Still, it's crazy that someone could just pick a place for you and decide where you're going to live without even consulting you on your budget, tastes, preferences. Definitely super over the line."
This is completely fucked up. You need to cut contact and convince her to leave. She is 23. He will fucking kill her. You need to go to the police and report what you heard. At least get on record that someone has heard him be abusive. He needs help. She needs to leave. I'm curious if his charm ever hit on your red flags? I bet if you think about it they did and you ignored them. Don't ever do that again. He will kill her. This is how this ends if she stays and keeps ignoring this issue. This is the cycle. Abusive and violent then apologies and charm. You should know this. He is not a friend. He is a monster.
"Dream job! No doubt.

6 months is nothing. You could break up soon ( especially with mom arguments starting ) and then be SOL.

If this was a three or four year committed relationship it might be a different conversation.

You’re still in the honeymoon phase now.
You’re not even dating HER yet, you’re still dating her representative.

Take the dream job."
"Stealing medication is a major red flag.  OP, hope your sister is open to therapy, sounds like she needs it."
This is called GSA-Genetic Sexual Attraction. It can and does happen to siblings who didn’t grow up together but meet later and life. It doesn’t always happen but it’s a biological phenomena
"easy.

counselling and/or end it. 

He's done being your partner - he's now the hostile roommate.  

My husband did that to me twice ""yes mom"" to me reacting to him being a total fucking asshole - I told him that if he said it again, I'd be done. I also said ""stop acting like a child"".  we've also both gotten counselling.

So far, he hasn't said it again."
"Don't argue with her in the group chat, just respond flatly with ""That's bigoted"" when she says something bigoted. Keep ignoring/avoiding her at home and stop living together ASAP. Since you want to keep your place, let her know that she'll need to find a new place to live once the lease is up. Give her at least a couple months notice. 

Before you tell her she has to move out, take extensive pictures of your rooms and belongings and email them to yourself. Hopefully she's not the kind of person to sabotage your stuff in revenge, but you never know, she's already proven herself to be a jerk.

Once you're not living in the middle of the fallout zone, discreetly feel out the rest of your friends and see if they also dislike her behavior (if she's saying offensive shit in a group chat full of feminists and queer people, probably they're not fans) and then form a new and better group without her.

In the meantime, spend a lot of time with your boyfriend out of the house. Your lease will be up soon and all of this will be behind you."
"Good, pack your shit and move out. He's treating you like a maid, not a housemate."
"Okay, time for some tough love. You need to work on your communication skills. Not once, in almost 2 years, did you bring up what was bothering you? This is a great way for resentment to fester. Your partner isn't a detective or a mindreader, and if something isn't working for you, you need to make it known. I know I would want feedback on what I could do better during the relationship rather than after a break up!

Sorry, man, but you're gonna blindside her and it's gonna suck for her. I guess the lesson here is to be more communicative in the future. Even if it's uncomfortable, you need to speak up."
"Put a LoTR quote or D&amp;D catchphrase in your tinder bio, I guarantee nerdy girls are out there (because my nerdy ladyfriends are on it, and definitely share screenshots of cute nerd bios).

Also, start looking for book club meetings and author events."
A modern woman works a full time job and contributes to something beyond her own hobbies. Your wife sounds like an entitled asshat.
"She’s 13. That’s like the most annoying age. Ask any middle school teacher about 13 year olds and they’ll tell you. 

Why doesn’t your BF relocate to be closer to his daughter the rest of the year?"
"The irony in this is that the more you obsess over it the more likely it is to spill over into real life, which is inevitably going to cause issues between you two, which will in time cause you to reveal what your issue is, which will in turn make him feel like shit because he was the catalyst, which could very well end up breaking you up."
"I am on this med and while normally I would agree 100%, keppra is the fucking devil.

I'm on 750 mg 2x daily and the mood swings were unreal to start.

OP get his vitamin B levels checked. Taking vitamin usually helps with keppra side effects."
If they only live 10 minutes away then why on earth do you need to stay over night?
"Absolutely. Even if she does decide to ""hold herself to his desired fitness levels"" (which she shouldn't) what if down the road she's not able to maintain that? What if they decide to have kids and her body understandably changes? 

I had a sudden accident a few years back and, although I'm not disabled in anyway, I do have permanent disfiguration. My SO has never batted an eye or shown any shred of doubt about our relationship. I'd question what this dude would do in a similar situation, though."
"Ha. Do not invite toxicity back into your life. The ONLY change here is you now have something they want. On their terms.

Your sister is 25, she can meet your wife and children. She's not a teen dependent on your parents. No it's not an easy stand for her to take (literally been there) that does not make it right for her to ask you to jump back into the negativity."
Be honest with her. Tell her the dilemma. Maybe she’ll be able to get through to John to work on his social skills.
"You'll get a lot of advice, but the angle I want to bring in is how to help her in the long term. Tell her you are there for her. If she wants to leave him tomorrow, or 3 months from now, you are there for her. Tell her you will help her make her EXIT PLAN. She'll refuse at first, but hopefully very soon you can get her to a counselor and looking at apartments of her own. Of course, I think she should leave yesterday. Don't get me wrong, I don't think she should stay one more minute. But I'm sure she will. The words ""exit plan"" allow her to think in terms of order and plans and usually that's something an abuse victim can grasp to some degree. 

Good luck."
"What does ""the right way"" mean to him? Especially since his story changed from ""busy at work""?

How does this behavior line up with what you know of him? Is he usually a perfectionist? Is he ever avoidant about things?

Have you guys discussed what you want your **marriage** to look like? Not your wedding ... your marriage. Have you discussed how you envision your lives together, how you plan to handle finances, if/when you want children, how you will raise them...? If yes, has he been an active participant in those discussions? If not, sounds like marriage is a dream, not a goal you're building together.

Do you guys still talk about your future marriage together? Have you asked him recently? I would ask him. Not about the proposal specifically, but ask him questions about your plans for the marriage. Get him talking. Could be he's not on board, could be he's overthinking how to propose. 

All you know right now is that he's given you 2 answers that don't get to the heart of what's REALLY going on, so you have to dig. This isn't nagging, this is a test-run for how you two will handle challenges together as a married couple."
"Unfortunately it’s not that simple.  You can call the cops, but if J refuses help or refuses to answer questions, then nothing will happen.  

The first order of business is to take J to a hospital to document her injuries, and then try to convince her that she needs help."
"&gt; he said no because I should 'trust him'.   
&gt;  
&gt; Then said that there would be conversations on there from before we met   
&gt;  
&gt; Then said that he had opened the app  

That should tell you all you need to know. If he was Pinocchio his nose would be a telephone pole."
"She knows it's tough because OP made her do all that work with their first. Obviously it isn't healthy or productive, but it's not surprising that the wife carries a lot of resentment."
Yep. Either of you could have hugged someone or bumped into a person on the street or elevator and picked up that eyelash extention. Why would you save it if you were sneaking around with another woman? Answer: you wouldn't!
"I heard some stats not long ago on the Reply All podcast. Husbands who use tracking software and hardware on their spouse are MUCH more likely to physically abuse their spouse. 

I’d take extreme caution going forward. This isn’t normal. My wife and I share our location through our Apple Family account, and it’s generally just used in the event that either of us is way late and we can’t contact them, so we’d know if one of us has been in a wreck. 

It is not normal for your spouse to covertly install a tracking device on your vehicle."
I agree.  It’s not too late to not be a groomsman.  You can just be a groom in a peasant suit or with peasant makeup.  You can’t afford this.  It’s the truth.  Stand in the truth.
"&gt; not liking him isn't a reason to exclude him

Yes it is. Going on a vacation with your gf's family is not a human right. It's a privilege. The parents can exclude him for whatever reason they want to as it's their money, not his."
"Sounds like you need to break up. Do you want to stay with her? If so tell her how you feel and what’s on your mind. If she puts all the blame on you unfortunately you have your answer.

It is shitty timing but either way she’s going to be mad at you when you break up with her.  If this relationship isn’t healthy or benefiting you it’s not doing either for her as well."
"It’s a shame, but I’ve seen weddings like this before and there’s nothing you can do but sit back and watch people make mistakes and be there for them when the shit hits the fan."
"It sounds like you're really beating yourself up for how your first year of college went.  Here's the thing: if you get your shit together (which it sounds like you're well on your way to doing), this is a blip in your life - something you'll barely even think about in 5 years.  Your friend, on the other hand, has demonstrated that he's not ready (yet? ever? who knows, not your problem) to course correct.  Just because you did some stupid shit last year, does not mean that you can't made decisions now that reflect the kind of life you want to live.  If he says something shitty and catty to you, you can laugh and agree that you did some dumb shit and then *continue to do whatever it was you were going to do,* which hopefully includes setting some hard boundaries w/ him, and prioritizing your classes over parties."
"I’m so sorry that you and he are facing this terrible disease. 

It’s not necessarily just the medication. His brain is being taken over by a growing tumor, which is very likely affecting his behavior."
Exactly exactly exactly
"&gt; Your friends are garbage human beings

Exactly. 

Distancing yourself from this group of friends is probably a good thing for you to do in the long run anyway, so just tell them to pound sand and that they will never be able to hunt at her property."
"Well shit, tell your Dad I'm interested in him too, and I'm a hell of a lot younger than Michelle, if thats what he's into.  Also let him know my rent is a lot less than $5k a month so he'd be saving a few bucks, too."
"They are driving there, not flying, and it's costing nearly double the one you're talking about. Plus, the costs keep going up which is completely unfair on the guests. How are they supposed to plan? Even aside from that, it's not normal to demand that your wedding party buy certain clothes or spend a certain amount on makeup or hotels. If you want to have a destination wedding where everything is exactly a certain way, you have to pay for it. It sounds like what's happening here is that the couple can't afford it and the bride's family can't either"
"*The other day, he actually threatened me with his baseball bat, holding it up with one hand and saying he will smash everything in this house.*

*He has used other threatening language towards me as well like, I will fuck you up, though he has never put his hands on me, but I know it's wrong.*

You are in an abusive relationship. Do not marry this man."
"&gt;When my mother asked why the wedding was so expensive, her father told her to ""stop talking back.""

That is... so much worse than I imagined. At that point, if I were your mom, I would have politely backed out of paying for anything. The father of the bride sounds like an absolute nightmare human."
"Yeah strikes me as very ""he was a star swimmer!"""
"Unfortunately, he doesn't have a fixed schedule so it's harder for us to schedule dates. But hopefully, we can gradually build up to something more stable. 

Thanks for the advice! And yes, I totally agree that it's a two way street."
😂😂😂 Who does that? Tells a person they met online to pay their mortgage? Ridiculously scam-y. Protect your dad. Thats scary.
"They felt ashamed and promised to do better. Some of them immediately made up for it by scheduling a replacement party, others stepped up to the plate the following year. I think what helped was that I came at them calmly and not with a lot of anger and blame, I was very firm and serious and I think they saw I meant it and I didn't come across as if I was taking my anger out on them. Had I done that I think they would have gotten defensive and written my feelings off."
"&gt; She's incredibly rude, loves to write violent stories, and is all around shitty to people. All her stories revolve around people being incapable of happiness, but she can't stand the mildest bit of pain. She lost her shit because l wouldn't open a soda can for her and cried that it hurt her fingers. 

If she's rude correct her behaviour, but she's 13 so that's pretty par for the course. She's an emo kid writing ""deep"" stories about stuff she has no concept of, also pretty par for the course. The soda can thing just... ignore as an adult? ""Here's a cup, and there's a tap. If you can't open a can of soda feel free to grab a drink of water instead!"" If she whines, let her whine.

&gt;She woke me up the other day and scream/whined at me that she thought she saw a spider. She was unreasonably angry when I told her I didn't see one and was going back to bed. 

So let her be angry. Give her a shoe or something and tell her she can kill it if she sees it again, or sleep on the couch if she's afraid of being in the room.

&gt; I'm home with her all day because I work from home. But I need to work! She talks though my work conversations when I tell her I can't talk and just goes on about nothing. 

Why tf is she cooped up inside all day in July? The girl is probably bored out of her mind which is probably exacerbating this behaviour. Get her into a summer camp or *something* so she has something to do during the day.

&gt; I get that my boyfriend only has his daughter about a month year and doesn't want to spend it yelling at her, but I really can't stand this shit. 

How do you think yelling at her is going to help?

&gt; She lies about showering and just turns the water on and doesn't use any soap. She's disrespectful to me and is rude about everything. 

So... let her stink? I mean who cares? Why are you policing when she showers? 

13 year olds are rude and disrespectful. You can correct her in an adult manner if she is, but you are the adult here and just need to deal with the fact that she is a child and acting pretty typically for a child that age. If she's rude in asking you for a favour just decline until she asks politely. 

&gt; I try to express my frustrations to my boyfriend but he's just tired and doesn't want to hear it. 

Probably because he knows. Like honestly, besides setting boundaries with her what do you expect him to do here?"
"&gt;  we dated in college for six weeks. That was 4 years ago.

You are reading waaaaay to much into this my dude.  That was a long time ago and so brief, I'd hesitate to describe it as a full on relationship.  In regards to the dog comment, that could be interpreted a lot of ways.  Like perhaps she was referencing when pets sometimes sniff out an injury or cancer in humans.  Maybe she meant the dog could sense you were feeling bummed out or anxious.  It could be anything.

I think you need to take a moment and reflect on why this is bothering so much that you'd need to seek out relationship advice from strangers on the internet like this.  It seems so trivial, and your response seems kind of paranoid."
"Let's not all freak out over the word ""common"" though. Common can literally mean anything depending on circumstances. He might see 2k cars a year, if he finds two he might think that makes something common. It's not common in the sense that it's like 1 car out of every 10 has a tracking device on it."
"this should be higher up, because i can see one of the family manipulating the sister into being allowed to accompany her on a trip to visit OP. ""I'm sorry sis, Mom insisted she come with me to see you."""
"Yeah, this is a huge red flag.

My ex husband used to do this. Even down to the ""car accident"" excuse and the ""got too high"" excuse. Always ""passing out on a friend's couch"" without calling. Phone dead, couldn't call. Stories always changing, details never fully set in stone. Got angry when I'd ask questions. 

Know what he was doing?

Fucking someone else. Actually more than one person, but the point is, he was cheating.

Also, you might think this is the first time he's done this. Wait until his other lies start coming to light. This is just the first time he's been caught."
"I was in the exact same situation. Last year, I stayed about a month at my parent’s to watch their elderly dogs and two cats. I grew up with the oldest dog and knew she didn’t have much time left so I gladly stayed the month (she passed shortly after).  My husband was fine with it at first, but started to feel very frustrated with the situation. He felt as though I was still my parent’s kid and jumped whenever they said…and this was very true when I realized it. 

We realized this was more indicative of larger problems between us regarding family boundaries. He felt like he was in competition with my family when I kept giving equal attention to him and my parents, and he did not ask to be in that situation. He pointed out how my parents didn’t seem to consider our lives as a couple, or him, for that matter, when they asked for my help.  Once we talked about it, his frustration totally subsided. It was never about the pet sitting in the beginning, it was about him feeling secondary and needing reassurance that I was his wife before a daughter. Your wife may be reacting to larger issues regarding your family, but may not be able to verbalize or understand these emotions entirely (it’s a tough topic). Maybe she doesn’t know how to bring this topic up if you’ve had arguments in the past, or maybe if you become defensive. Maybe she feels like you put her in a situation where she has to compete with your parents, and it makes her uncomfortable. You just have to communicate 😊"
Nobody understands why victims don't call police.
"The sister's been privately in contact with OP since the beginning. She never had to reconcile, it doesn't sound like there was every any bad blood there."
"As someone who cut off a volatile dad 10 years ago and just cut contact with a similarly toxic mom this year, you are not crazy, you have this right. Don’t go back into contact. No one would recommend you keep letting someone in who behaves this way (even the one example of your mother getting the phone is completely out there) if it weren’t your parent/family. If a friend’s SO did this and their sibling said “oh but they love you,” one would shut that distortion down right? Your sister is in the FOG. If she can’t recognize the conditions that very reasonably led to you ending a toxic relationship, that’s ok, it’s where she’s at, but it doesn’t obligate you to compromise your boundaries either. Ask her to respect your decision even if she doesn’t understand."
"You don’t own the land so access is not yours to give. You aren’t even in a position to ask her for your friend. Just don’t ever bring it up because it is not an appropriate favor to ask. That’s where it starts and ends. Your friend asks you, you tell them it’s not your land so you can’t help. End of discussion"
"I disagree that ""nothing will happen""-- B's violence will escalate after, and OP will be cut out, as punishment for calling the cops. Non-consensual police intervention can be extremely dangerous. Only call the cops when J is ready to talk to them, which I hope to g-d is soon. You probably have to play nice with B until then, hard as it may be, to retain access to your friend. Once she's out of there, you do not want to be staying anywhere B knows the location of. very best of luck, OP."
"So, three things.

 1) him having a sexual past with her is not a real problem so long as he does not reciprocate her feelings. It's his job to maintain respectful boundaries but there's no reason that that specifically should lose him a friend. 

2) LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE YOUR BOYFRIEND IS DOING IS WRONG. If you said you don't want this person in the house in which you both live, she doesn't come in. He is letting her use your things and sleep in your home and he is LYING TO YOUR FACE. 

3) There is no teaching you how to fight because the fights don't matter. He'll just lie to to you again because she's more important to him than you are. What makes you think he'd really block her and she'd stay blocked if she's so blatantly unafraid of your vengeance that she'd post pictures in your home? He's going to make you doubt yourself and lie to you and make you the crazy unreasonable one by being this two faced. 

You deserve respect in your relationship. You deserve trust. He offers neither. It will not get better from here."
This all happened when the OP left for college - 12 years ago.
"It's the straw that broke the camel's back.

He also made a comment along the lines of  ""not wanting anyone to be mad""....which is also telling.  That's the kind of people-pleasing thinking that makes someone a doormat, and can be infuriating as a partner.  Cuz usually it's the partner that get the short end of the stick."
"Have you considered talking to someone professional about this? Sounds like they’ve always been this way and it’s only recently that their personalities have bothered you so much. Has there been a change in your life that’s caused you stress? Maybe somethings going on that’s shortened your temper.

And to be clear, I’m not saying that the things you’re describing aren’t annoying. I just wanted to consider the situation from another angle."
Why the hell should they get access to hunt on some family’s property they are friends of boyfriends of daughter of property owners of? That’s incredibly entitled
"The problem here is that you ""feel like a guest"" on what you've even stated is a trial run at living together. You aren't a guest in your own home, so why would you be a ""guest"" in hers if you're both temporarily treating it as a home you live in together? 

I agree that you shouldn't be doing *every* chore, but if you live with somebody and you share a home, it shouldn't matter which of you made the mess. Take pride in the space you live it and keep it clean, is how I view it. I live with my boyfriend and a roommate. It doesn't matter who made the mess, we all take turns doing dishes or straightening up or doing yard work. Because we all live there."
"I think this is a smart way to go about it. Using his terminology (mom) to show him you aren’t doing what he complains about, and yet he is still complaining."
"I think you both just sound very tired. Exhaustion can make people crazy, and you are responsible for two small people. Your wife is going through a stage where she really doesn't like you very much, so maybe just give her some time away from you and the kids - offer to look after the kids on the weekend so she can spend time with friends, get some fresh air and some retail therapy. Or she might just want to sleep in a quiet house where you take the babies out. She might feel better if she has something else in her life besides work and babies. 

I can't really follow what you were trying to do during your night duty - when babies wake up at night they just need to be fed quietly and then put straight back down. You can do that with an expressed bottle or even one bottle of formula at night, without waking your wife. (Controversial advice: One bottle of formula at night might be the magic solution to helping you all sleep better - it's so much more challenging for the baby to digest, baby sleeps better with all the effort).

TL;DR - let your wife sleep for at least 8 hours straight; give her some free time away from babies and work, while you take the helm; give her permission to be angry and resentful for a while, keeping in mind that she is really really tired. Bonus advice - if you take the kids out for the entire day, and the result is absolute chaos, don't tell her it all went fine. Tell her you have no idea how she manages it, because you found it really difficult!"
Can you let us know what happens please?
"I really like your idea of setting her own end date and not telling him about it. She's been patient for long enough. If she decides to follow your advice, she has to be resolute and not give him a second chance."
"If those are her expectations for your pets, I bet just not doing overnights would help the tension a lot."
"Even if that's the case, those package deals are usually $90-100 per person, with free makeup for bride if X people sign up. And this is in the higher end spas, so $200 is all kinds of red flags in itself."
"My complex does have some available, just sent em an email."
"You have every right and reason to express concern over this crush and expect an open dialogue and effort on his part to overcome this.

If he can be hurtfully open about having a crush that makes him realize he's bored and fallen out of love, then he can be equally open about the steps *he* is taking to fix *his* part of this. It's not 'policing his thoughts', it's making sure you're both on the same page. There's no point in trying your hardest to mend and strengthen your relationship if he's too wrapped up in another woman to notice."
"One way or another it seems like you two really need to get into marriage counseling because you sound like a walk away wife in the making. I don’t blame you whatsoever, but I don’t think a magic phrase will repair what seems to be a deep rift in the relationship."
"It's not a relationship, it's OWNERSHIP.

&amp;#x200B;

She owns you. 

&amp;#x200B;

You are her child.

&amp;#x200B;

Get out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Won't be easy but you need to grow up. I mean that in a loving way. You are dependent on her to meet all your needs, just like a child is of a parent.

&amp;#x200B;

Time to leave home."
"True story: I thought I was in the brain cancer sub and not relationships. I wouldn’t have been so upfront about his prognosis had I clued in, but in retrospect I am glad I did."
There is a lot I want to say here but mostly have you looked into care taker support groups?
"23 year old lady who actively uses snapchat here. It sounds like she likes the attention she receives. The hesitance to open them in front of you screams of a red flag to me. If she’s been consistently receiving nudes from someone she used to hook up with and still hasn’t blocked them, also a big red flag. It would not fly with me. At all."
"My husband proposed to me in between his extra long shifts plowing snow in the middle of winter. The snow put a damper on his plans, but he still managed to sneak it in haha"
"Yeah, this guy has poor life decision written all over him: No one uses heroine recreationally, and a 2-year old kid with someone he no longer is with, yikes. Then the fact she's buying him furniture (doesn't matter if it's cheap stuff from a second-hand shop or CraigsList) because he's got no money for it, that is a MAJOR red flag. You don't need most furniture and if at 32 he's not got money for a mattress and some cheap garden furniture, he's absolutely a waste of time. Also, that he's comfortable asking someone so much younger for stuff he should really be able to afford himself, is disgusting. Then on top of that the money he makes in his entry-level job goes to child support, so I guess he doesn't have shared custody.

I would be EXTREMELY worried for her too. She's being taken for a ride big time.

How can she afford to buy him stuff? Does she still live at home? Is she in work or college? What are her ambitions? Is she planning on living with him?"
This should have been on your list of things to discuss before moving in.  It makes sense to me for you to do all the housework if you arent paying rent.  Sit down and discuss it...and pay your fair share.
"Prior to moving in together you found a way to see each other about once a week. Whatever system you used then, use now to set aside specific time to have quality time with each other."
"No, that’s not normal. If you are truly splitting it all 50/50, you might as well just fend for yourself. Buy only your own food and tell him to buy his own.

Do you do all food preparation, or is that shared? What about other bills?"
"Start looking for a new apartment. Getting into petty games with your roommate or family never tends to go well, and he's both."
"One bit of clarification...how often do your parents ask you to do things for them, not just pet-sitting? Do you make it a regular habit of helping them and your wife possibly resents you for it? It just seems strange that your wife would be upset over you helping out your parents a couple times per year..."
"If I was having a destination wedding that was expensive and the outfit was essential, I would make sure I could afford to pay for it myself. Otherwise I would consider the wedding outside my budget.

&amp;#x200B;

Planning something and making someone else pay for it sounds so damn strange to me."
"Some jobs legitimately do not have schedules, and you don’t know *even a ballpark guess at* your start or end times in advance - quite common in the construction industry at least in my country.


For example let’s say it’s Thursday, youve been working 5am morning shifts all week, at 8pm Thursday night your boss phones and says “hey tomorrow is an afternoon shift come in at 11am” and then at work the next day you don’t even know what time you’ll be going home until your boss walks in and says “hey we’re done for the day” which could be anytime from 5pm-2am. 


Not sure if I explained that well but TL;DR at some jobs you don’t even know your work schedule while you’re at work during that shift therefore planning dates without taking a vacation day is literally impossible"
"Dumb down your house like right now.  I am serious, he can't be trusted and your current locks are useless."
You know what. That’s fair.
This comment should totally be higher up.  They are totally trying to get OP's family to bankroll the family reunion... That is what this reads like...
"I've seen GBM patients go through 180 personality changes because of their tumor. I commend you on your dedication to your boyfriend and his condition. It's not easy. They go through physical, mental and emotional changes that can get overwhelming. I'd say get into therapy and continue being the supportive, loving partner that you are."
"Ouf that's a really hard spot to be in, for her and for her family and friends. Is she getting grief counseling? Any therapy at all? She really needs to be seeing a professional."
She might need counseling for dealing with the emotional abuse from her paranoid mother.
Right! I haven’t worked out a single day since meeting my SO and he just walked into the kitchen to see me eating whipped cream from the can in the middle of a dark kitchen. He still looks at me and thinks Damn I did good. Because he loves me as a person and not a body type. If I was overweight or unhealthy and he expressed concern about wanting me to get more into fitness then that’s one thing. But not wanting to get invested and have the future talk with OP because she’s not into the same type of sports when they’re both active and heathy is a red flag imho. If he HAS to have someone that shares his hobby then she should walk since there’s no future here and he’ll probably have a hard time finding someone he’s compatible with that also happens to like the same things.
"I’d be careful with making a apology line like this for someone who may be a possibly well meaning flying monkey.  Then you get a half ass apology and what is OP’s problem?  She got the apology she wanted.

This was your parents’ choice to make.  You have to respect it, and your sister has to respect it.  It isn’t your choice to undo.

Disowning you was an intentional act, and these are the consequences.  Don’t like it, take it up with mom."
"If he wants to do it, and this is a getaway/minivacation for him, as some might suspect, then he has been dishonest in the presentation of the question."
"This is my question too. My parents have an older dog who is sick and needs a lot of care, not just after dinner."
"&gt;get a glimpse of what marriage would look like

And now you know why it is so important to live together before walking down the aisle. 

&gt;how will it be when we’re married or have kids? Is it normal to go through this “comfortable” stage in life

Well, when you have kids, ALL your energy goes towards the kids. This ""comfortable"" stage in life will seem like a utopia compared to what it will look like once a child (or children) come into it. If you're hooked on the excitement of 'dating', then marriage is not for you. Maintaining a relationship through marriage requires a ton of work. One exciting date a week is basically what the weekend is to your normal work week."
When does he get his schedule? Look at it when he gets it and choose what night to go out then.
"I think sometimes part of being a friend is being honest with your friend and tell them what you think is the truth, even though they may not want to hear it. I would take **ONE** conversation to be honest with your friend about how you feel regarding her relationship and make it clear to her they your only advice you can give regarding their relationship is for her to break up. After that, stop being her shoulder to cry on regarding her relationship. Be her friend as much as possible, but if she tries discussing any relationship problems, be like ""I already gave you my thoughts and advice regarding your relationship and can't help you anymore with this subject"" and then change the topic of conversation."
The loss of high school friends upon realizing they're toxic as adults is a painful but universal step to adulting.
"They ""forgot"" three years in a row? Are you a black sheep or scapegoat in your family? Do they play favorites in other ways?"
Your boyfriend is lying. And it sounds like you know that he is. There's no good reason for a person in a committed relationship to have Tinder on their phone.
"Your friends sound like mega losers. Time to ditch the zeros! Tell Lexi she has nothing to prove to those chumps and neither do you. Better friends are out there, pick the good ones. Quality over quantity."
"Agreed. I wish they would though! If it helps other folks who are reading this, it’s because sometimes calling the police doesn’t result in an arrest. Then the victim is left with an abuser who is now pissed af that the police were called. Same for if there IS an arrest, but then they were released. Often folks are financially dependent on their abuser, and who the fuck is gonna pay rent if they are in jail or prison? Leaving an abusive relationship is also the most dangerous time for a victim. Even if they leave while their abuser is in jail, what happens when their abuser gets out and starts looking for them, and maybe they wants revenge? And on and on and on and on. If people want to judge some more I have a thousand other reasons ranging from lack of shelter space to none of their god damn business why."
"The hard thing about advice for what ifs like that is it all just depends on how he is monitoring her through these devices.

If he has a file of all of her key strokes sent to him at set intervals then hopefully she had been typing a lot today just to make it more difficult to go through.

If he has constant monitoring on the car then he already knows she went back to the shop.

In any of these scenarios it is important that she tells at least one person but preferably more that she needs to be checked up on multiple times until she says otherwise. And then that communication is immediately subject to these same what ifs.

For those reasons I don't think the key logger individually is more or less worth the worry compared to all the other possible monitoring methods/devices he could be using.


Most importantly if because of this she is at all afraid of him just get out of the house. It honestly doesn't even matter if he knows where you are just so long as you're not alone."
"Some people have mental illnesses, some people are idiots, and some people are idiots with mental illnesses."
"Forget your laptop, forget confronting him : GO TO THE POLICE. 
It doesn't exactly matter who it is, SOMEONE is tracking you. 
I'm not saying it's time to levy accusations, but it is 100% time to get this shit on the record. Don't tell your husband where you are going. Just go to the station and tell them exactly what you told us and that your husband had access to your car. 

If there are any other signs of worrying behavior, you should let them know. But simply finding such a device warrants an investigation. May it be successful!"
"She wanted a caravan and a 4WD and you agreed without blinking? Sounds like you guys need to communicate more and prioritize how to communicate and better function as a team. Your issues aren’t really about gaming or taking an hour everyday for yourself.  If your wife and mother of your children is having mental health problems, you should be doing more to try and get her the medical help she needs. Even if you do work towards divorcing, it’s in the best interest of your kids."
"Please listen to the advice to confront your husband about this somewhere public OR from an otherwise safe place. If he did put the tracker on your car, that means he has insane levels of paranoia and control issues. He might seem like the greatest guy ever, but that could change if he thinks his control might be slipping. 

Honestly, I would do what others have suggested. Say you're taking it back to the shop for a minor issue, and then later check and see if it's been removed or not. If it has, that will basically be proof that it's him. Go straight to the police or somewhere safe, and confront him over the phone. You have the pictures from the mechanic to show the cops."
"The thing is, it kinda is unforgivable and you don’t really get a do-over.  She won’t be pregnant again, so you don’t get to show her that you won’t wake her up all night for baby duty while she’s pregnant and exhausted and working full time (you wimped out after two wake ups?  Try five).  You won’t have another newborn, so you won’t get to show her that this time you won’t “take liberties” and leave her twisting in the wind.  

You need to really step up and do more, and specifically guard her sleep.  If she’s been horrendously sleep deprived for 2 years now, and you’re the reason why this sleep deprivation is so bad, she will resent you even more with every sleepless night.  If you let her experience a full night of glorious, glorious sleep, and let her sleep in as late as she wants - this may change things."
"Not forgetting the emotional labor itself even when chores ""split 50/50"". So sure, you're attending the 4 month check up, but do you have questions for the doctor based on any behaviors? Did you schedule to appt, who is doing the follow up? What about packing and prepping for the trip? There's so much that goes into it."
OMG how is this even a question. YES you walk away.
"&gt;One of the last messages is from him, asking if she has a BF now, because he saw us together. She confirms and asks to stay friends.

Also sounds like she is keeping him around as an option. I'm sorry, but keeping a love interest like that as a friend is shady as fuck and a huge red flag."
"Maybe you should look a little more into the bit he said about you not being willing to change, or listen. I feel like there is something there - something he experienced that maybe you did not experience in the same way. Maybe he feels dominated by you and you don't realise. Maybe he feels like he is in your shadow somehow. Maybe he doesn't enjoy being a twin and being compared all the time. I'm not saying it's necessarily true, I'm saying there's a lot of weight behind saying something like that. It's also possible something outside of your family happened that he is projecting onto you - did he recently fall out of touch with someone or get into a fight?

On the other hand (and this may frustrate you), you are both young and on the cusp of starting college. It's normal for people your age to want to rebel, to want things to be different when you go off to college. He could be looking for a fresh start, and he is expressing it poorly.

Take some time to calm down, and try to have another conversation with him about this. Maybe start off by asking more reasoning as to why he thinks you won't be willing to listen or change. 

If the situation is"
Yep this dude is trickle truthing her to the max. I wonder how many more layers of lie he while unravel before she gets any where close to the truth.
Her family is awful. Have a talk with your brother and tell him the expense has gone beyond what you are comfortable with. People who expect you to pay for their events are being ridiculously rude.
"This argument doesn't work if *some* of the family is celebrated and only *one* person is left out. 

But go ahead and project those feelings, son."
Yeah agree. Every time I’ve had my make-up done it’s between $75-$100 depending if I get false eyelashes or not. And every time I’ve been a bridesmaid makeup and hair are OPTIONAL - we are welcome to do our own.
"On your edit: it would be mighty convenient if you could help more with the feeding, but if your wife prefers to breastfeed exclusively and not pump then that limits the options. But I wonder if you read the comic ""You should have asked"" by Emma? It describes a dynamic where the man is willing to help out, but the woman still shoulders the mental load of keeping track of what needs to be done and managing tasks. That's a job in itself (hence why ""manager"" is a job title), and can keep things unequal even when two people think they're doing as much physical work. Do you find yourself asking your wife a lot for what you should do next? If so that could be an issue. You do describe being ""proactive"" elsewhere so maybe you already know about this Also, you say she doesn't like leaving your son with you because she doesn't trust that you can soothe him - that's her prerogative, but is your reaction to that ""OK if you want to take care of him then do that, I just want to help"" or ""it's my son too, I get to look after him as much as you, don't worry whether I can soothe him or not because while he's with me it's my problem, what with him being *my child* and all""? The former reaction is that of a child doing chores. The latter is that of a parent caring for their child. You ought to have the latter attitude."
Not overreacting at all. This person is a piece of shit. And thank you for taking the dog!
I think you should tell your husband you are going to the police about the tracker and gage his reaction to that.
"This is really THE solution. You both deserve the same number of free hours. Make a big-scale week for both of you, and divide it up by hours, fill in work/chores and see what's left. If she can't see how unfair it is that she has more time than you, she doesn't respect you."
"I work in the infusion pharmacy of a major hospital. My job is literally preparing the chemo that is given to patients. It is so toxic that we have to wear special protective gear, work under vented hoods, and use special closed-system devices that minimize our contact with the stuff. Some of these drugs will literally burn through the gloves, burn through the skin, spread and then burn you again from the inside out. It is really terrible stuff. That being said... people live through it and come out the other side, somehow. Some of these drugs are miracle cures. GBM is a beast,  though. Also the chemo itself may be causing personality changes. Having worked with patients, I can tell you that brain cancer drugs in particular are notorious for this. 

My mom had cancer and didn't make it,  but it was incredibly exhausting supporting her. I can only imagine being in a romantic relationship with someone with cancer. It must be gutting. I hope that you are taking care of yourself,  too.  Does he have family nearby,  or other friends? It must be very confusing thinking that this is the 'version' of him that you get. Maybe they will be able to fill you in, and maybe you can all support each other. 

This is one of those 'life just isn't fair' sort of situations. I'm so sorry,  OP."
"I didn't jump on the ""dump this loser like radioactive waste"" boat until he tried to blame her.

""You have a legitimate reason to ask me to prove my innocence and I can do so quite easily, but you're so ridiculously emotional and illogical that I can't."""
" I'm not clear -- is it on you, socially, to manage these events? Or do different people do different things?

One of the hardest things to manage socially is accepting not everybody will always be invited to the party and not being responsible for what happens as a result of that. Social media really sucks for this reason. I can't tell you the number of people I know who were shocked they weren't invited to a wedding, dinner party, etc. because they saw it online. 

Some tough love: Please relieve yourself from this burden and stop discussing this topic with your friends. Those who exclude Anna and John need to be honest with them and why. 

Communicating to Anna why other people don't want her husband around is not your job. Also, think of the risk of doing this -- what if Anna goes bananas and everybody denies everything you said? Because that happens, too. 

You can't manage the guest list or manage everyone else's feelings, and as you stated, social media. This also includes managing Anna.  If she asks you about it, politely tell her you didn't inquire about the guest list. 

Continue to see your friend, but let the chips fall where they may."
Break up with him. He doesn’t care about you or your well-being. And who steals antidepressants? It’s not a drug you can use for fun or anything.
"Both of those things are things he has to decide for himself. Even if you're worried, you can't do anything more than highlight those concerns. If he's still adamant after that, you just have to accept it."
Thank you that is a good suggestion.  I will put it on the list of possible solutions.
"Because he's afraid sometime at the shop who is underneath the car will see it and ask her about it...

If we're right about everything else this is what already happened.

Did you read the post?"
"I commented on another persons post, but wanted to throw out there once more, that the number one thing you can do, is listen to and be supportive of J. 

Doing anything else (aka calling the cops or confronting B) though you or others may feel it will help, won’t remove J from this scenario on her own. She can only leave once she feels safe and strong enough to do so. Abusers often isolate their victims, so being there for J will break this cycle. Help to build her autonomy by reminding her of her strengths and asking her opinions and what SHE wants to do about this shitty situation. Then listen, and support her in her decisions. 

Other than that, call local domestic violence crisis lines and shelters. See what resources there are in your away. That way when she is ready to leave, SOMEONE is prepared. It’s really hard to sort through all this shit when you’re in trauma, so having someone who can walk you through it or know what’s even available can be super helpful. 

Also, good luck. You’re already doing the super great but super hard work of reaching out rather than ignoring the situation. I’m proud of you. 

Source on all: I’m a domestic violence and sexual assault advocate."
“my spawn point”. Gotta love Reddit.
"To me it kind of seems morally wrong to do this, in that these are traditionally male dominated spaces where girls already get hit on all the time. My last girlfriend and I used to Friday night Magic together and there were so many creepy guys. Do you really want to add to that? Am I overthinking this?"
"Yes this is perfectly normal. They don't it the 7-year itch for nothing. Relationships go through a lot of phases (I've been with my husband for 20 years). You need to be prepared for that and not freak out or jump ship whenever you're going through a down phase. The excitement (or honeymoon phase) will inevitably fade with any relationship after a certain point. Hopefully you've built a strong, deeper foundation by this point. And while the excitement will never be the same as when you first started dating, you can always create a new kind of excitement. As people have said, just switch up your routines. Find ways to have deeper conversations beyond just the day-to-day talk. It's not even about going out. Just do small things to switch up your routine at home. Watch new movies and talk about them. Reconnect with activities you both enjoy. You can always make the time regardless of schedules. And learn to appreciate the deeper connection you've built. If you leave every relationship because the excitement has died down, you will always be alone. The grass really is green wherever you water it."
"Yea but a wedding party outfit, hotel, and airfare all for ~$1000 for a destination wedding, especially for a close family member, is actually quite reasonable. I paid ~$600 for all that for my gf’s bestie’s wedding, so I’m not getting the run there. It seems he more wants to bail bc they’re being rude and demandy about it, which is a separate issue."
What's the magic coffee table?
"There are laws in a lot of places that allow lease breaking for domestic violence reasons. *Tell the lease holder the truth*. Tell them that your BF violently assaulted you and you absolutely cannot fulfill this lease. They can sometimes be willing to end things right there rather than go through the legal disasters that could happen for them later.

If you’re willing to file a police report and/or ask for a restraining order, it can help the lease problem tremendously as well."
"Thank you, those are words I needed to hear. It's always nice to know that other people have gone through the same thing and turned out fine. I just have no idea how to bring it up to him. The comments here are quite helpful though!"
"Then I strongly recommend you don't go back to that site again because it's full of idiots. 

I guarantee you that the 6 week ""relationship"" you had with this woman 4 years ago has absolutely no bearing on her thoughts and feelings about her current relationship."
"I feel like you did a rookie mistake many young people do, think that HR is your friend and there for your sake. They are not, they are there to protect the company from legal liability. Sometimes the best way to protect the company is firing you, be aware of that. So many people think that they should bring every little thing to HR, when in many ways the absolute best thing is to stay as far away from HR as you can. Unless you have an actual issue for HR, like she is freezing you out because of your sex/race/protected status, im not sure what you wanted HR to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

The correct person to mediate is not HR, its your boss. You should bring up these issues with you manager."
"Your boyfriend has a long history of being an entitled, selfish jerk. 

Why are you with him?"
"Sure, now he’s doing more work, but it doesn’t change that his wife is deeply resentful of his past behavior. Plus this is a one-sided story, and he doesn’t even look that great in his own account of what’s going on. 

If OP really wants an unbiased audience, he needs to get to marriage counseling. Using reddit as a sounding board to figure out if he’s “doing enough” based on a one-sided story is pointless. Obviously his wife doesn’t think so and neither of them know how to fix it. They need a neutral third party to discuss this with."
"I'm not the one who posted the comment but my guess is

1. Mixing laundry together or even the roommate's hair getting stuck to comment OP's clothes. Then it ends up in OP's underwear.
2. The shower
3. Different hair colours. My hair is purple so if someone found it in their butt, they'd know."
"I'm not the only one, he admitted to keeping track of my sister and wanted me to tell her so he could apologize for invading her privacy and so she could change passwords etc."
"This is not how PARTNERS treat each other.

  


My husband is my partner

I've got his back, he's got mine. If I'm late coming home, I text him so he doesn't worry. If I'm going to be late with my friends, I give him a heads up. If I'm supposed to be home Friday, but my friend has doses, then I'll text my husband. It's not fair to just abandon him and let him think I'm dead while I'm having fun tripping.

  


Your boyfriend is irresponsible. He is a poor partner. This is not how responsible people act.

  


Pay attention, because my guess is you will start seeing more if this behavior."
"Friend...walk away. The fact that this guy, who you have been seeing for 7 months, does not already look at you and think ""damn, I did good,"" is ridiculous. I get wanting a partner who has the same hobbies as you, but his reason seems more shallow than that."
There's a lot of exercise he could do with a muscle injury in his hand.  You're making excuses for his inability to learn ways to manage his stress and anger.  He has an anger problem not a stress problem.
"**The petty side would really want to ask the mom where her rent money is for the time she has stayed in your apartment lol**

If you really do not want to live there then I think you should tell your girlfriend that you do not think it is fair that you didn’t get to pick the place and you have to pay half the rent, especially when it’s to you gfs mom,and you never expected rent when the situations were flipped."
"They're Mormon; it's in her post history. 

Odds are, they want to be in good social standing with their respective wards and don't want to risk jeopardizing a temple recommend. They don't want to be associated with a failed marriage in the family, because it means they've failed to properly guide OP along her ""rightful"" spiritual path."
"He spent the weekend fucking someone from work. Of course that's a leap, a huge leap made with no parachute to support it. As a guess, maybe it's true and maybe it's way off the mark. But the point is this, *that lie is big enough to make you fairly question everything*. Can you take the revised version of events at face value? Being out for the entire weekend and freaking you out, would he take the hit on something which still angers you to mask something which would absolutely blow everything apart? It's too easy to let the mind run."
"I think this is a really good tip. Counseling might be good for this period too, though.

&amp;#x200B;

And in addition, I'm not a breastfeeding expert but I think that waiting before feeding and letting a child get completely worked up isn't actually beneficial for the whole process. I could be way off the bet, but it might be good to see if you can find someone who can give you proper advise on how to structure feeding times and feeding on demand etc to see how you can end up with the most balanced feeding schedule and happy baby..? That might take some pressure off your wife's shoulders, too."
"I agree with this. I see a lot of comments making excuses for this guy. I dated someone for 4 years who did these small, seemingly no big deal things and I gave excuses for him and decided to overlook. Eventually he would get into a routine of getting silent and angry, then breaking up with me and ask for me back. What I should have done is confront them, let them know you do not tolerate this rudeness and it is their responsibility to communicate their issues to resolve with you. If they can’t do that, leave. It will do more damage to your self esteem than you can imagine right now."
"""Don't pick up my cat"" requires zero reading of body language.

""Don't punish my cat"" also requires zero reading of body language.

Locking your cat up like that was animal abuse.  Who knows what he is doing when you aren't watching. 

 If you insist on staying, set up a nanny cam. I bet he mistreats the cat when he is mad to punish it."
Letting her stay home alone isn’t an option either. She will let him in the house and nothing will be left by the time they get back.
"&gt; I’ll be spending nearly $1000 just to be there

Sucks, but not worth nuking your relationship with your brother over.

&gt; the fiance’s father telling my mother she was irresponsible because she “wasn’t prepared” to pay for a larger sum of the destination wedding

This is bullshit.  Your brother and his fiance should have had a conversation with your parents about costs and how much they were willing to contribute before they decided on a venue.  No one should be acting pissy because your parents aren't willing to contribute more money because the wedding is expensive.  With that said, your mom should tell anyone who asks for more money to pound sand and leave it at that.  You should drop a note to your brother letting him know the two families are not going to get along if people keep demanding money, then let him deal with it."
"Ugh, just reading this makes me feel so uncomfortable, and he's not even my BF.  I'm imagining if my (male &amp; hetero) partner were spending that much time focusing on a hetero male friend and I'd still feel bothered by the lack of boundaries.  Phone calls 3-5 times a day (unless the friend is going through something serious) is too much.  40 minute ""goodnight"" phone calls when you're in the process of hanging out are pretty weird.  Going out of his way to monitor a friend's bedtime and nanny them (unless they are in need of real social support) is inappropriate.

And that's if the friend is another straight GUY and your BF is straight and hetero.  Adding in all of the other elements of sharing a room with another woman while blowing off your feelings about it, stating that he feels an ""obligation"" to her, etc. are just turd cherries on a shit cake.

Of course it's possible that she's gay as heck and has zero romantic or sexual interest in your BF, but that doesn't mean that their relationship can't still make you feel uncomfortable.  It doesn't mean your BF's actions can't still hurt you.

Trust me, I'm a girl who has years of experience gaming online using Discord/Vent and meeting tons of people online and irl.  My partner and I both have male and female friends that we've met online and irl, and we don't have boundary issues like these.  There's something going on here that reeks and you need to stop trying to be the cool girlfriend because it's just getting you walked over and disrespected.  You definitely deserve better."
"It's not unreasonable to have one night a week where you do your own thing. In fact, I would say that this is necessary and important for a healthy relationship. Maybe you could suggest that she do an activity of her own while you are at DnD? It would be good for both of you."
"So it’s totally reasonable his reaction is TO PUT A TRACKER ON HER CAR?

If you think someone’s cheating, you talk to them. Or, if you’re pretty sure, decide what you’re going to do then.

You don’t leap to “I will track them secretly.”

Well, the rest of us don’t. Kind of side-eyeing you now."
Right? Like he says he’s falling in love with OP but he doesn’t even think that OP is something to be proud of now??? What a lame dude!
"Gotta agree. I wouldn't want any of them knowing anything about where I lived, worked, or where my kids went to school."
"I’m so sorry you’re having to go through this. My sister had brain cancer. Giblastoma. Her personality changed significantly. She was not only on the same seizure medication, but also did chemo and radiation. She wears a devise called Anovacare that sends electrodes to her brain to fight the cancer. 

Her tumor was located in the area of the brain where her impulse control was. She very impulsively said and did things that were hurtful and offensive. She posted rapidly on social media. We had to monitor her social accounts because it was so bad. She became incredibly forgetful. She was accepted into Harvard law school before her cancer and was once the most brilliant woman I knew, and she lost a lot of her intellectual abilities: math, memory retention, spelling and ability to write papers quickly. 

At times she can nag others so much it’s unbearable. She had a meltdown over my dad and I being 30 minutes late because we grabbed tacos for an Easter party. When I mean meltdown I mean screaming and crying and accusing us of hating her. The cancer changed her. 

But....there’s hope. She’s survived since 2015. Her brain scans have come back clear. Slowly her old personality is returning. The doctors will never say she’s in recovery because the relapse rate is so high. She will always be in treatment. Her energy is always low. But...as she recovers the old her slowly returns. 

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s rough. I’ve been there too. Feel free to dm me for extra support❤️❤️"
She 100%  has to. That's a very serious traumatic event to be dealing with at a very crucial time in your life when you're starting to be independant. It's only going to get worse if she doesn't. Has anyone brought the idea up to her?
"Start planning stuff yourself for your birthday instead of hoping they will. Your feelings are reasonable if they are consistently treating you differently than everyone else. 

All you can do is control your own actions and behaviors. As an adult I've never had another person make birthday plans for me, if I want a party I have to ask for it/plan for it. 

Tell them you are hurt and why and leave it at that. If they don't apologize or put effort in then it's time to move on with or without them."
"If your therapist hasn't yet brought up co-dependency to you, you should do some reading on it. I had fucked up friendships like this with gay guys in college too. It's not healthy and there IS such a thing as being too close."
"I’ll alleviate your curiosity right now...lol...the “hive mind” is going to think your proposed dollar amount is gross and obnoxious. And they’re not wrong, it is, but at the end of the day it’s your disposable income. 

I’m in a similar combined income bracket and while I wear a larger than average diamond engagement ring, I can admit to you right now that it wouldn’t make my life or relationship any worse to have gotten a smaller or different ring, and I wouldn’t be even an iota happier had the ring been 20 times the cost."
"I'm a bridesmaid for my friends upcoming wedding and its the opposite for us. We are paying our dresses, shoes and alterations while she pays for the makeup and hair. It is a destination cruise wedding so fortunately she isn't delusional enough to ask for wedding gifts"
"Your friends are gold digging assholes, for lack of a better phrase. 

Do not introduce Lexi to them and make ZERO effort to give them access.  If you feel compelled to USE HER on behalf of your friends, you're an asshole too.

You're likely going to lose friends over this but it doesn't sound like that would be too big a loss.


Good for her for making her own way in this world and being frugal and sensible."
"Your cat doesn't deserve to suffer for your wanting to give your BF a chance to learn. I mean, how's that going to work? You've ALREADY explicitly told him about not punishing the cat multiple times, and about not man-handling it, and he keeps manhandling your cat and he deliberately went against what you said and punished your cat. It's not just that he doesn't understand, it's that he's defiant. It's your cat, and you told him not to do certain things with it, and he did it anyway. It doesn't matter if he understands WHY or not. ""Don't do X"" is a simple rule to follow even if he understand the reasoning behind it. And he either can't or won't do that. If you want to give your BF a chance, find your cat a safe home, because it's not safe in your home as long as your BF is there."
"He is an idiot and I would be gone the minute he tried to punish my cat, let alone traumatizing it.

Seriously, why are you with this guy still?"

"You should wait until you have a more secure handle on your end of things. Make sure you have funds, a place to go, and transportation to get there in case you need to leave quickly. Pack a bag, make sure you have your important papers - SSN, birth cert, etc. 

How are your finances handled? Do you have joint accounts or individual? Who's name is the car under?  Whose name(s) is the house listed in?"
"At the risk of the karma hit, it's totally possible to love your children and be a good parent whilst regretting the circumstances of their birth. Plenty of parents wish they'd been better off financially, been further along in their career, chosen a better partner etc etc."
"I think a medical abortion is best at this point. We both want kids eventually, and it would be heartbreaking to let a baby go like that, but we are not in a place to provide for it. He may have a different opinion though."
"No more than usually a couple times a year, 3-4 days at a time. I usually go home after work, hangout at the house until like 8 or so and then go to my parents house to stay the night. 

I don’t feel like there’s a whole lot for her to have to worry about while I’m gone, I’d try to help with whatever before I leave for the night, so I don’t see why that would be an issue. 

I too see what she means, but I don’t see much responsibility needing to be taken care of at the house besides the 3 pets, it’s not like they’re children, that would be a different story."
"Yeah. If a baby or toddler does something he thinks they should “know better” not to do, what will he do then?"
Thank you for your time writing a response. After typing this all out I definitely realized how much more this is impacting me than I had really thought and will be reaching out for support for myself too.
"Yeah, that commenter also listed 

&gt;wake you up with breakfast in bed

You guys are definitely on the same page."
"Aside from what others have already said, I would be really concerned about this “sister” taking control over your mother life in a more legal/financial sense.  She sounds truthfully psychotic, I’d be worried that if your mother moves down with her sister will somehow gain control over her finances and decision making ability (think legal power of attorney) therefor cutting you off from your mother completely.  If sister finds a way to manipulating your mother, it should be a very scary situation. You would have no legal say if something happened to her.  I feel like this sister is setting your mother up to completely cut you out.  You need legal help as well as try to get your mother some professional mental help. She may need an outside party to tell her how fucked up her sister really is. I’m sorry you have to go through this and it is a very scary situation to be in. Maybe try r/legaladvice?  Update us if you can."
Why don’t you try communicating before aborting mission?
"My mum has the exact same diagnosis, same medications (including the TMZ) and I presented with a seizure. She had her tumour in the temporal lobe, and I was told that surgery to remove it wouldn't be impactful, but...it has been, on a big scale. I feel like I lost my mum, who is a big part of my life, when she had her seizure. Her personality has changed drastically. She cares about work and my disabled brother, to the exclusion of all other things. She has no filter anymore and says some truly horrifying things to strangers and friends/family. The woman my mum was a year ago would be horrified at this woman's behaviour. Apparently, temporal lobe brain injuries are notorious for causing significant alterations to personality. 

Regardless, she's my mum, and I don't have a choice but to be with her and support her. I have begun to access some counselling simply because the ""pre-grief"" is difficult to manage, and I don't want to have the same outcomes this time as I did after my father died 20 years ago of the same cancer. Keppra is a rough drug, as is the reality of dealing with GBM and the terminal diagnosis it is. I wonder if some counselling through the cancer center your BF is being treated at would be helpful? I've also found places like the Brain Tumor Foundation and other similar non-profits to be of use, particularly in convincing me that I'm not going insane, this is real and it's devastating, and managing it/dealing with fallout is hard.

Please feel free to PM me any time."
Totally agreed. We did the dinner after he did the knee in the parking lot. Haha glad I’m not alone.
"Omg, I never knew I needed this sub till now. I'm about to binge on that crazy town"
"Ok... This is honestly really concerning. Your brother is making you act like a parent, while disrespecting you and denying reality. Your father, at a time when y'all were likely grieving, abandoned y'all and KICKED YOU OUT. I feel like you definitely need to move away from your brother but also need to take a hard look at your family and patterns. Seriously if you can afford therapy.... Do it."
"It's a linguistic shortcut (easier to say ""we/our"" than ""he and I"" when I'm talking about something that applies to both of us)... but I see your point. These are the first close friendships I've had since 9th grade, so there's definitely a codependency problem here as well."
"If you’re not sure where he stands re: abortion, please take a little time to yourself and prepare yourself for the worst before you tell him. “Pro-lifers” can get very, VERY nasty."
"Here's my take on it as a 30 year old who uses Snapchat. 

If she is entertaining people who are sending her stuff with the obvious intention of trying to hook up, she is keeping her options open OR she wants the validation. Either way, not particularly healthy, but also not super surprising for a 22-year-old. 

I know loads of people who live-and-die by social media, but when they're in a committed relationship they don't allow that kind of behaviour from other people. They shut it down. It has nothing to do with Snapchat and everything to do with the person. It doesn't matter the medium people are sending nudes, if your girlfriend didn't want a guy sending her nudes she'd shut that shit down.

Sending videos of your new home is a bit more normal to me, I mass send certain videos like that to everyone on my list (which would include my ex's mother). Selfies are pretty normal, but again there's a difference between a sexually charged/shirtless/come-hither selfie and a selfie with a filter.

Anyway, yeah I'd be not okay with it if my boyfriend was getting sexual Snaps from women, regardless of who they were. The platform is unimportant, in any scenario if he wasn't shutting that shit down it would be an issue."
"I'm in a similar situation - I'm your age and I cut off my dad ten years ago, my youngest sister is 25. Her and I are close and she wants me to reconcile with him.

To be fair, your sister is in a difficult position. She feels torn between two sides and it's not a nice feeling. If she's like my sister, she's been raised as the peacemaker and feels responsible to fix everything in the family. It's easy for reddit comments to state that you're right and you're family is wrong (this is objectively correct) but it sounds like your concern here is how to maintain the boundary while still maintaining the relationship with your sister.

When my sister brings up reconciliation, I say something along the lines of ""I care about you and I know it's hard for you to feel caught in the middle. I need you to trust that this is not a decision I made lightly, and accept that I will not be changing my mind. I love you, and dad loves you, but the relationship I had with him is not the same as the one he has with you."" Any pushback and I change the subject or end the conversation.

If you have the emotional capacity, you can talk to her about how she feels, and help her practice setting her own boundaries with her family. If you have the financial capacity, you can help her access a therapist where she can work to accept that this is a situation where there is not a perfect outcome. If you can't do either of those things, that's okay too.

Your safety and mental health (and your wife and kids') are more important than your sister's comfort, and your boundaries are more important than ever because you are protecting your family as well as yourself."
This is common? Jesus.
"disagree


these are several aspects that go beyond typical costs:

* destination wedding

* pestering to buy an exact suit and have it tailored

* $200 makeup

* hotel rooms more expensive than promised

* expecting the brother to chip in - just handing cash because... why?"
"You could say that your friends don't like people who make them uncomfortable on purpose, and you don't either.

Honestly, though, Anna is probably a lost cause. She finds John tolerable. She thinks the way he acts is okay. You don't have to argue her into agreeing with you that he treats people badly. You can just let her have him and stop trying to be friends with her."
She's got a point.  You're checking out from your current responsibilities to her and your household for days at a time several times a year.
I wish I could upvote this more.
"So he is a bully about this? It's concerning that you are backing down and that this is a fight in the first place. If you want granola bars, buy them and pay for them yourself. You shouldn't have to give up granola bars because you're in a relationship."
Her job transferred her from Charlottesville to DC; he took me on an 8 hour date and at the end said he was dropping me off at my mom's because his girlfriend and kid lived in the house now.
He wants to be dating someone else and hopes you’ll mold yourself into that person. Don’t.
"Sad but very likely.

He owes her a lot of money. They fight about finances and chores and I'm betting the fights aren't ""he's just too generous and helpful."" He vanishes for an entire weekend and feeds her embarrassingly transparent lies. Oh and he's *thirty*, it's not like this is a kid just figuring thing out."
"on the flipside, not to be negative, i was friends with twin boys growing up where one was truly cruel to the other and the other spiteful in response. i think keeping an eye on them and making sure this is at least a passing thing is a good idea. the issues my friends had had been life long from childhood, i'm sure just knowing someone was there would have helped both of them."
"&gt;This should have been on your list of things to discuss before moving in

Indeed. This post *screams*, ""We didn't talk about our expectations were before shacking up."" You view it as something akin to a vacation, she views it more like a trial marriage, and neither of you have clearly communicated that to the other, so your expectations are clashing.

Sit down together and *talk about this*."
He doesn’t want to. And he will never want to. You ok with that?
"I’ll add to this; I’m old enough to have made plenty of mistakes in life and the best advice I can give is, if your gut is telling you something, *damn well listen to it*. Don’t “play nice” and do something you’re instinctively opposed to. We’ve evolved these feelings for a reason."
"Although seeing what the Reddit collective has to say is fine for the sake of idle curiosity, this boils down to you, my friend. If you’re planning on getting $20,000-$45,000 worth of enjoyment and satisfaction out of owning and wearing this ring, by all means spend the money. On the other hand, if there’s even a hint of concern in your mind that a decade from now you’ll think, “hmm, I wish we would have blown that cash on another vacation/room remodel/investment/whatever, shop at a lower price point."

OP already PMed me the link so this exchange was very friendly and informative before you butted in.

I asked for a PM because 1. I wajted to make sure I had the same video they were referencing but mostly 2. I was on the bus to work and didn't want to use up my mobile data browsing videos, didn't have earphones so that'd be super annoying, and a PM is easier to find back later in the day 

Thanks for checking in, though."
"Yeah, I had to read it a few times over."
"Why did you have children? Did you have in-depth discussions where you made plans around care for them? 


You can be a good husband before having kids and you can be a good father but it sounds like you were a terrible husband while being a new father. Part of being in a relationship is love but the other part is feeling validated, respected, and overall feeling like someone else has your back. The part about her telling her daughter not to marry someone like you.... I mean she's right. Who in their right mind would marry and have kids with someone who isn't willing to take on 50% of the responsibility?


I remember coming home one day from a very long business trip and just wanting to take a shower after 30 hours of travel. My boyfriend hadn't maintained the bathroom, so I had to clean it first. The level of resentment I felt in that moment was insane. It took me a while to get over. But that was just one incident. I can't imagine being able to get over months of tasks being dropped like you describe. To be clear, I'm not saying you were a terrible husband, but you weren't taking on the fair share. That's always going to lead to resentment.


I think you need to separate. You've demonstrated that you're not capable of being there for her when things get difficult. It's really hard to love someone knowing they won't love you when their life gets a little tougher. It's really hard to make plans with someone like that. You two can coparent without having to support each other as partners."
"This 100%. OP, get advice from people who know what they're talking about. Don't call the cops until/unless she wants you to. And MAKE 100% SURE THAT SHE KNOWS YOU'RE ON HER SIDE. You can't assume that she will assume you're on her side. In her eyes, you're HIS friend.

You're surely not the first person to witness the abuse, and I'm sure that few or none of those folks have done anything to help her or let her know that they find his behavior unacceptable. She assumes you're the same as them and will sweep this under the rug. You need to explicitly tell her that you find his behavior horrifying and unacceptable, that you support her and want nothing to do with him, and that if she ever feels unsafe again she can call you and you will help her leave."
"To be real, your brother's fiance's family sound like psychos. I wouldn't want to be anywhere near them, let alone spend a fortune to go see them. Does your brother get along with them? Are they this awful all the time?

When you marry somebody, you marry their family."
"I know two people with strict Asian parents who got married without the parents approval. In the end after many threats to disown them/not come to the wedding, in both cases the parents came around and now accept the situation. For them right now it’s about loss of control more then anything, once they realize they can no longer manipulate or control you they will likely accept the situation"
"&gt;I can see what she means though. If she works from 9am-5pm and I have a game at 5:30 pm I can see why she would be upset.

Really? Is she incapable of being on her own? Why do you *have* to be at home when she's at home? It's completely unjustified that she gets angry at you for having your own plans sometimes. She wants you to schedule your life around hers without any compromise on her part. How is that reasonable?"
"Or he does, just not to OP."
"I don't think it matters if it this is ""regular college-age stupidity"". I am a gay man and when I was in my early 20s, there were definitely friend groups where talking about sex more explicitly/in detail was acceptable and others where it wasn't (and that's still true now). (I will say him actually masturbating with you in the room and having phone sex absolutely crosses the line for almost all people and could be considered sexual harassment.)

What matters is you are not comfortable with it, you can't be that friend for him if that's what he wants, and you need to establish your own boundary there with him.

He may hit back with the idea that you're being homophobic or sex-negative. I don't think there is anything you can necessarily do to make him see differently if he doesn't want to at this time, so I just want to put that out there so you are prepared for that. I think /u/Tata_zooom's script is good.

As for your friend, I think there is a lot going on there. Delayed adolescence, seeking validation through sex (especially if he feels like the rest of his life is falling apart/failing), etc., all stuff that he has to work through and may never really click coming from you. He may get healthier and still be having lots of sex with lots of people. He may stop having sex and still be in a bad place. BUT getting him to start self-reflecting should not be your priority now, your priority is getting yourself right. It may come to that point where you have to say, ""I care about you and want the best for you, but we cannot be good friends for each other right now. I will be here if you want to talk about something other than sex, I will be here if you have an emergency (if you are! you're not obliged!), but I need space and time to work on myself."""
"Get the order, he is escalting and becoming dangerous. Do not let family deter you from this. Get a therapist to talk to, dont talk to your family. They are being niave and selfish. Stay safe"
They also celebrate her SIL's and BIL's birthday. It's safe to say that they're being shit bags.
"Right? My husband and I were walking back home from having a drink at the local bar. He goes “oh hey look at those ducks” and drops to one knee. Took about ten seconds of his time and no elaborate planning. If he WANTS to put a ring on it, he should."
"&gt;she doesn't want to risk me infecting her or our newborn baby. I've been sleeping in our spare bedroom.

You have a newborn.  Go to the doctor immediately or get a hotel.  Don't you dare put your child at risk because you refuse to get medical attention."
"My partner would not be on the phone for hours with someone he met three weeks ago. I can understand mixed gender friendships, I get it, but he’s not chatting to his lifelong male friends for 40 min multiple times a week. That’s crazy.

He’s not making an effort to set boundaries with her."
"So you have a boyfriend problem, not a gamer girl problem. Right now everything that's bothering you is because of choices he's made. Unless she is literally controlling his behavior, he should be able to set boundaries in their friendship like deciding to have a separate hotel room, not breaking plans with you to talk to her, or not becoming her emotional support. 

You're really focused on what she's doing, possibly because you're afraid your boyfriend won't set boundaries if you ask him to, but the only person in this situation who can actually do anything to make it better is him. Don't fall into the trap of becoming passive in your own relationship because you want to be a ""cool girlfriend"", sit down with your boyfriend and talk about boundaries even it feels scary or difficult. It is absolutely reasonable to ask your boyfriend not to share a hotel room with a girl he's known for three weeks and presumably has never even met in real life."
"&gt; I mean he did tell me he never wants to live with a female until he is married.

Yeah, this combined with his refusal to let you stay over is a clear red flag. Definitely do *not* marry this man before you've lived with him, or at least found out why he's so desperate to keep you out of his living space before marriage.

There are a few more yellow flags (at the very least) in your comments...

- he refers to women as ""females"" (a quick google will give you a better explanation than I can about why this is engrained misogyny)
- he pressures you to have sex in your home instead of his, even though getting caught by your parents could literally get you kicked out
- he's straight-up lying to you about why you can't come over (he told you it was ""messy"", but when you convinced him to go to his place, it turned out not to be)
- he refuses to communicate unless it's about something that pleases him

**This is a 30yo man**, and he's acting like a highschooler. It's time to demand better treatment and respect for yourself. Or better yet, find a partner who actually, on their own, naturally *wants* to treat you with respect."
"Unfair to your parents?  
FUCK YOUR PARENTS..

Ask your sister to meet if she wants but if she so much as whispers to the parents she's going to meet you, you're done.."
Well your brother needs to understand that bankrupting his immediate family isn't right just so they can be selfish and have a lavish wedding. Know your limited on what you can can not spend. His fiance isn't compromising with anyone or being empathetic that people cant afford her dream wedding It about love and being United into one family not $200 make up artists or a $400 suit that's just absurd to expect someone to pull that saved money for a wedding unless you guys make bank in your careers and are part of the elite profession of Doctors and Lawyers. A talk needs to happen and if your brother gets mad he'll just have to deal with no one from his family attending
"&gt;I get both sides. I just hate being in between them.

As a general rule, the correct answer to this dilemma is ""choose your spouse"" with very few exceptions."
"I went to the police station to make a statement about the violence of my (now ex) boyfriend. I was making plans to leave that weekend (which the police knew about) but I needed it on record that he was physically attacking me. Despite me speaking to the police on the phone regularly about my safety and begging them not to come to my house - as I was in the middle of carrying out my escape - they knocked on our front door. Thankfully I never answered the door and told my ex it was a sales man. 

2 years later and I’m still disappointed that they did that."
"Is it a healthy pregnancy, have you had an ultrasound? Just asking because of the risk of ectopic pregnancies. How did your doctor determine you were six weeks? Did you ask for a pregnancy test? Only asking because where I live it’s not routine, unless the doctor has a reason to check.

Honestly you have three choices. Get an abortion and not tell him or tell him. 
Tell him and keep or not keep the baby.
Tell him and give the child up for adoption.
Take some time to think about it. And go from there. If you plan on telling him don’t wait too long, that could make him upset."
"Here is a tip from an old man: she has proven to be untrustworthy; now you get to make a decision. If you want to be a suspicious boyfriend, continue to stay with her while the resentment grows until you explode and become the asshole; or drop her immediately and continue on the quest for a trustworthy partner. Yes, binary as hell, but that's how it is. Good luck, Redditor!"
"You and your dad are both being abused by your mother and both of your parents are seriously dropping the ball as parents. 

If there are any sane and caring adults in your life, try to be around them as much as you can to soak up the positive energy and guidance from them that you so deserve. That’s what’s important. Focus on the good in your life wherever you can find it until you can get out of the situation you’re in. 

My heart goes out to you. You come across as a caring and responsible kid that any decent parent would be proud of."
"Speaking as a first generation American born Asian, asian culture is as strict as you allow it to be.  Time to grow up and make choices independantly of your parents and accept the consequences of them.  All immigrant children are eventually faced with this choice."
"This is the underlying issue that she hasn’t explained to you properly. She probably only half understands it herself. An invasive mother is a lot. There’s a reason you’ll run into the saying “it’s easier to divorce a mama’s boy than to change him”. Even if your mom has “calmed down,” your wife’s discomfort with pet sitting is probably symptomatic of a long standing tension she feels about her place in your life compared to your mother. What she and you probably don’t understand is how her relationship with her parents informs all of these feelings. You say she is spoiled and her parents never ask for anything “maybe because they know the answer they would get” but some parents just give and don’t ask in return. My in laws are like this and as weird as it sounds, it takes some adjustment to see what a gift this can be when you come from a different family dynamic. I highly suggest couples therapy so you two learn to communicate and get to the root of the issue."
I would just drop this person as a friend. Especially since they don't take criticism well. Their drama is just going to hold you back.
Exactly what I thought when I read that. She wants her cake and eat it too.
"Thanks for responding. I just made an edit clarifying that right now he has no tumor mass in his surgical resection site. He is currently taking monthly TMZ to deal with any of the ""tentacles"" that may exist from the original tumor.

He is not on any other medication other than tegretol, keppra and TMZ"
"Are you saying that you've never stood up for yourself and said no, there has to be give and take, and she needs to do it your way part of the time?"
"*There is no universal rule to parenting*

Eh, I think the majority of people can agree that one universal rule of parenting a child is that you have to be around them for more than 1 month a year to qualify as a good parent."
"Definitely get the police involved. This does not sound like a man who you want to think he can assault you without consequences, no matter how much you may hope this is the end of it and he's out of your life."
"Maybe your wife feels that YOU'RE being taken advantage of by your family assuming with very short notice that you'd be free to dog sit and leave your wife for 2-4 days at a time. Why can't they get a dog sitter? Or ask someone else? 

You can't live your whole life pleasing your parents. You're an adult with your own life, partner, house and pets which should be your main priory. If this is happening more than twice a year then it isn't right. When you dog sit your wife is more restricted with her life so it's not like it's just you having to make some changes"
"I need to know

1) how this transfer took place
2) how you found such things in such a place

This right here hits the nail on the head.
Hahahahahahaaa I LOVE this!!!
"You need to speak to your brother immediately. Tell him exactly what his bride to be and her family have been demanding of you and your family, and say that he needs to step in- especially where your mom is concerned. He should be really ashamed of himself that he has been ignoring this situation and pretending nothing is wrong while his future family is insulting his blood family and squeezing them for money. Tell him he needs to talk to his fiancee and her family and get them to back off, and he needs to apologize to your mom."
I agree this is highly probable
"Exactly.

There's a lot of women who drag their SO through every relationship milestone and then get surprised when their SO doesn't put any effort into the relationship.

Like getting married isn't going to fix the fact that he's just not into her."
"Imo, document everything. Take pictures, write down the contact info of the mechanic. 


If he is tracking you, then I would prepare for a worst-case scenario. Tell at least one person you trust, and share the documents with them. And when you do tell your husband you found the device, prepare to make a quick exit. I have no clue how he would react, but there are a lot of victims out there who thought their partner would never hurt them. 


Are there any other behaviours that are odd? Is he suspicious of you or tells you you can't see your friends?"
"A lot of guys won't want to be with a girl that still hangs out with ppl she had a lot of casual sex with.  And it's not like you can even say,  ""Well, I'm not hanging out just one on one with them"", bc that doesn't matter bc you had group sex with them. 

I'm not shaming you, I'm telling you to be prepared if it's a dealbreaker for him."
"&gt;  He says that other men supposedly notice and supposedly stare  

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a climate that's freezing cold for 6 months a year. Tell your husband that women are objectified in every climate and in every style of dress. Up here we get cat-called and harassed in thick winter parkas that hide every curve. You are correct. This is a fight worth having. You are not wrong."
"You have no obligation to let these people back into your life after they basically disowned you. If they really wanted to be part of your family, they should've thought about that before disowning you. Make it clear to your sister that you want nothing to do with them in your life and get distance from your sister if she can't respect that boundary."
As someone who got her eyelash extension stuck on her boss' wife (after her hugging her) this is EXACTLY how these things move about.
"Agreed. Boyfriend has essentially not sourced any engaging activities, no childcare and hasn’t even taken time to be with his daughter. A lock on the door will just exacerbate the feelings of rejection and resentment."
"With that, it's a miracle your mother still thinks about attending."
"I think you should both write out how many hours in a week are available for chores &amp; discretionary activities, e.g. 10 hours at work, 2 hours commuting, 8 hours sleeping, whatever yours is. Don't include hobbies or elective pastimes, things you don't *need* to do. So say yours is 13 hours of work plus 8 hours sleeping, you have three hours left in the day. Say hers is 12. I'd say that you should be doing 20% of the chores, her the remaining 80% because that's a fair way to conceptualize the time you each have to do things, and if she was doing the amount of work you were doing, that would factor in too. With that said, if she's digging her heels in, I think you should make seeing a therapist a priority and find a way to get away from your job for a couple hours. Your marriage needs it and it should come first, unless you want to find another wife down the line."
That’s abusive. Him tracking you like that is abusive.
"Try explaining that she's making a blanket statement about situational issue. Let her know that a marriage is a partnership, and expecting you to pull far more weight turns it from a partnership to a dictatorship. Let her know how it's hurting you that she won't give you the support you need, and that working to ensure that you have enough money to run the place IS a household responsibility. If she still won't budge, suggest that she return to working full time and then you can discuss a 50/50 chore schedule. You may just have to be stubborn about this one."
"My husband and I picked out my engagement ring together as well. He was going to propose at a later date but couldn't wait. He asked me later that night while we were standing in our kitchen and I had a mouthful of crackers. It was goofy and perfect.

I would have grown increasingly concerned if no proposal came after months. I think your assessment is correct. This doesn't sound like a 'hell yes' response. It's very lukewarm and ambivalent."
"But what if OP WANTS to stay with the pets?  He said he grew up with them and seems to enjoy this and want to care for them in this way.  Where is there a middle ground that also allows for OP to do things that are important to him?  I understand that she isn't happy with this and a middle ground needs to be found, but his wants should be considered as well."
Just sit him down and tell him in a way that you think will be best received if that makes sense? You know him best! I tend to make inappropriate jokes when I'm in shock so I walked into the room with a test and said lol I'm pregnant - do not recommend! But even then it did all work out!
Ouch! Probably took longer to plan the wedding!
It’s NOT OK that he is leaving it to you to make the decision about whether or not he gets another room. That needs to be part of your conversation as well. It should not be up to you to tell him how to behave. Especially after a conversation about it. His response should have been “I’m going to get a new room.” That would have been a universe better than him waiting for you to tell him to get another room.
"My husband found a pair of boxers in his underwear drawer that were not his. He was not impressed. They turned out to be his best mates from when he lived with us (we did all our laundry together).

I did try to explain to him that *if* i was having a fancy man over for extra marital shenanigans I would not be washing said man's underwear and even *if* I had washed their underwear I certainly wouldn't have folded it and *put it away in my husband's drawer*."
"This is true.  OP, my now-ex did what you are doing (and included cheating) because he just couldn’t open his damn mouth and tell me what was wrong.  That’s so unfair, and it’s downright abusive to the other person.  You lead her on, let her believe everything is fine, and you don’t tell her when something is wrong.  Now you just want to cut bait without giving her a chance to fix things ?  Holy shit dude.  That’s cold, and utterly cruel. 

If you cared even a bit about your girlfriend, you would speak up and tell her how you feel and what you want - in words.  Don’t beat around the bush.  Don’t hint.  Don’t expect her to read your mind.  In fact, show her this post so that you can’t weasel out of telling her the truth.  You told a bunch of Internet strangers more than you have told your girlfriend of *2 years*.  Let that sink in.  Can you see how utterly fucked up that is ?

&gt;But she’s much more of a homebody and I’ve always been the one who ends up staying in with her even though I work in entertainment and need to go out for shows and things a lot for work.

You need some therapy.  You need to learn to assert yourself, to communicate your needs and to compromise, instead of just giving in to avoid a confrontation.  By playing along and not communicating your wants and needs, you are lying to your GF and abusing her love for you.  That’s so messed up.  

You don’t want to hurt her - but you’ve hurt her every single time that you didn’t express your needs.  Every time you told her you loved her when you had resentment building you hurt her.  Breaking up is going to hurt her, especially since you didn’t have the guts to just tell her “I feel...” and “I need..”. 

You need some *serious* therapy, like right now - because this will be a persistent pattern if you don’t stop this dysfunctional way of conducting relationships.  You expect her to read your mind and then push her away and want to break up with her when she doesn’t do what you want.  But you never *told her* what you wanted, so that’s moot.  Get some therapy, please.  You really need it."
"&gt; Or is this just closure because now I have a definitive answer on where the two of us stand?

I suspect it's this one.  Often the stress we feel while anticipating a consequence is worse than the actual consequence itself.

You've spent the last however long carrying in your heart the hope that things would get better and the fear that they would not, and because of the hope, the fear was that much more burdensome.

Now the hope is gone, but the fear, which outweighed it, is gone as well.  So you feel relief."
There's no magic words. Yall needed to get in marriage counseling awhile ago. He sucks and your communication skills (your meaning both of yall) sucks. Likely he isn't going to change though. But give counseling a go.
"Tell your ""friends"" to fuck off and stop trying to use your girlfriend for access to better hunting grounds? Why is this even a question for you? Why do you think they'll be so offended, and why do you care?"
"To a place you pick though. Not to something someone else chooses for you, then uses to control you. It's a huge loss of independence, as you're already experiencing."
"Is this a vacation or a trial move in? If it’s the former, I see why you think of yourself as a guest. If it’s the latter, you need to discuss how you see splitting up chores if this thing goes full time. You just need to talk to her either way. No one on Reddit can tell you how to divide labor in your household. My fiancé and I did a two month trial move in before he ended his lease and moved in and we didn’t treat it like a lease. It was essentially no different than when he actually moved in. He works from home and does more chores. He’s happy to contribute that way. If you two have different visions for life, you’ve learned what you need to learn about the relationship."
I feel like after 5 years you should be able to be more direct about it
"Damn that sounds like some shitty friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always vague with my reply so I don't get roped into something I don't want to do, like, ""Not sure, I need to check with my husband, why, what's up?"""
"Don't pick up my cat.   End of discussion.

You've dated a year and he can't handle boundaries or trust your judgment?  Just. No."
"This actually is the only cost that isn't completely unreasonable sounding. HOWEVER, I paid for my bridesmaids make-up because it was from a highly rated professional and I knew that kind of cost would have been prohibitive for two of them (not $200 each but still over $100). I wanted them to look gorgeous and not stress about finances at the same time. OP's brother's fiancee just sounds like mega bridezilla."
"&gt;massive insecurity/control issues or something darker/deeper?

Massive insecurity and control issues get very dark, and very deep pretty quickly."
She probably doesnr understand how horrible it was for her big sis. She grew up with her parents eprspective of her older sister being the black sheep. Her view has probably been warped.
"I just want to point out that after everything your mother put you through, you titled your post about racist comments against your boyfriend. Your normal meter might be a bit off.

Take one big step back.

She's manipulating you, probably the rest of your family, and the police. She filed a false police report that lead you to being institutionalized. I'd bet you a semester's worth of books she has *zero* intentions of funding your education. You are living with an abuser. Go back to your brother's house if you can. Go literally anywhere else. Check what resources your school has available for emergency housing assistance. I have a bad feeling she's going to go nuclear immediately before you're supposed to leave."
If he hasn’t already.
"Honestly, if his first reaction WASN'T ""I can't believe she booked us only one room; I'm taking care of it immediately,"" OP should be done.  He should never have even contemplated staying in the same room, let alone hiding it."
"He's kind of using you as a fetish device. It sounds like he gets off on being a verbal exhibitionist. You happen to be the most convenient target to satisfy that urge, with unwilling strangers being the second most convenient. 

That's just shitty immature behavior. Most people fuck, only assholes go around talking about it at full volume in public places."
"But the other costs arent that unreasonable either, they are just jumbled together.  He says nearly 1000, but is including his tux, his room, travel, and any miscellaneous.  Since he is family and it is 12 hours away, the hotel room is likely for at least 3 nights.  And it sounds like he agreed to stay at the main hotel, and not a cheap motel.  So lets say the price is 150 a night.  And lets say his outfit is about 200 with a $100 worth of tailoring.  That is already 750, which becomes nearly 1000 when you add travel.

None of the above is that unreasonable for a wedding. And it makes sense that they may have gotten a special group rate for booking rooms that was taken away as more people dropped out.  Weddings are expensive and things add up.  Could they be cheaper?  Sure.  But that isnt so unreasonable.


And lets get into the destination nonsense.  This isnt really a destination wedding.  The two families live far away, so it was going to be closer to one of them.  He wouldnt be calling it a destination wedding if the brides entire side has to trek 12 miles to where he is.  It’s just the reality of living far apart."

Imagine how alarmed someone with natural hair would be if they pulled a strand of purple hair out of their bum.
"Everyone suggesting this seems oblivious to the fact that a lot of pets, especially senior pets, do not usually cope well in unfamiliar environments, or especially where other animals already have a clear domain, even more-so an animal that is going blind. Do y’all think they’re just toys that can be placed wherever you want them? There are a lot of factors at play when taking care of animals and it’s not as simple as many are making it out to be."
"You are trying WAY too hard to protect her feelings. Turn off the notifications, read it once a day or once every other day, and engage at your own pace. She is sending pictures essentially into the ether and does not seem to care that no one is really responding. If she mentions it, just say that while you love your nephew and want to be a part of his life, if you're not physically there you don't need to see his day-to-day, you have other obligations and people to interact with, and you'll catch up with the thread in your own time because you're sure all the pictures are lovely. 

It's like when people have babies on Facebook and that's all they post about. You can't tell the new parent that you don't give a shit about their baby, but you don't give a shit about their new baby. It's fine, they're consumed by baby. They are baby. Baby is them. All is baby and baby is all. It wears off eventually but until then is exhausting but they don't give a shit because they are just so blissfully in the baby zone. So what do you do?  Either throw them a like now and again or just hide their posts and call it a day."
"&gt;&gt;“no reason, just want to wait till we get married”.

This is not a good enough answer for a major change in the relationship terms. She may be trying to get you to propose, she may no longer enjoy sex with you, who knows? But she can't get away with not tellling you her actual intentions. ""No reason"" is bullshit. She has a reason, she is just not telling you why."
"Furthermore, go to the police station ASAP and make a report about the incident so that there is a paper record and they are aware in case the situation escalates. You don't have to accuse anyone and they're not going to run out and arrest someone because you make a report, it just starts a paper trail."
"I don't have any advice, but I will say what your wife went through is precisely the reason I refuse to have children. I will not put myself through that alone."
"WOO buddy, what is your brother getting himself into with this family? Mercy, I can only imagine. I love my siblings, but honey chile I do not have $1k+ to spend on your wedding. Enjoy your honeymoon, it's gonna be short LOL"
I think you should just talk to your girlfriend about why she wants a $20k ring (cut? clarity? size?). Reddit is probably the worst place to ask because unless you're giving her a $50 ring and elope with pizza afterwards people will judge you.
"She was just careless enough to talk about this *next to their mother, while she could overhear everything.*"
we have discussed counseling and that is probably the next step. thank you for your honesty
"No it is not a fair arrangement. You are right to be upset for such thing. Talk again w your gf and tell her that you both are fine and there's no need for such move, after all you are paying for everything even though youre not married at the moment."
"You pretty much gloss over the fact that there’s a newborn in the house. A newborn getting the flu can be deadly (literally), and while it does seem like an intense step to take, I would actually side with your gf on this one. You haven’t even seen a doctor to diagnose yet, and you have a HIGH fever and a cough. Both things that, depending on what you actually have, will make your baby very, very sick, and can again, be DEADLY. 

No, it’s not normal for a gf to make to stay in a hotel when sick, but in this situation it makes plenty of sense."
This is such an interesting perspective thing because I really don’t think 6-10 days a year spread out over the year is a lot at all! I think it’s a bit weird that OP’s wife can’t handle the separation. Its hardly anything!
"Talk is cheap.

Actions are what matter.

He says he wants to, but he doesn't.

Folks need to do a much better job of ""listening"" to folks actions because they speak so much more loudly than words.

Folks may say anything.  Here you go.  1 plus 1 equals 3.  There, I said it, so it must be so, just like when this guy says he wants to have sex with you, but never does.

I'll leave you with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Folks who want to have sex, have sex.  They look for times,  places and reasons to have sex.

Those who don't want to have sex, don't have sex.  They look for excuses and reasons not to have sex."
"Right? Right? That already inflames me when it's directed at children, I've never heard of an adult using it to another adult! And not even in an official hierarchical relationship at that! OP, did your brother have an opinion on that interaction?"
"I've been a bridesmaid in two weddings and it was the same way, pay for your own dress. They weren't bad tho, I don't think either was over $200."
"The fact that he wouldn’t let you look at the app simply because you should “trust him” tells you all you need to know. There’s clearly more to the story and he’s hiding something. 

He’s fractured the trust in your relationship. Until he shows you his phone or proves to you that it truly was accidentally downloaded, you’re going to have a very hard time trusting or believing him. I’d think long and hard about if you really want to stay with someone like this.

For me, this would be so disrespectful and a deal breaker. I’d be breaking up with him ASAP."
I disagree with this. I've been with my partner for 7 years and he drives me up the wall but I still love him because he's my pain in the ass and he sure as hell makes the sun shine out of it too. Your partner can drive you insane sometimes but people are flawed and that's okay! As long as you rectify your issues that's all that matters.
"My dad doesn't condone her behavior, but doesn't do anything about it either. When she screamed about threatening to leave us and slammed her door on the way out, my dad asked if I was okay and gave me advice on how to avoid her. He always tells me ""just go along with what she says if you don't want to get attacked"". My dad isn't the best at communication but I know he cares a lot. I'm really worried about him too, though. He called himself fat once as a joke after my mom made us do a ""system"" where we all (me, her, and dad) weighed ourselves every morning and night and write down how much we weighed. I know that isn't a lot, but I can see his self esteem getting pushed down further and further every day. I care about him a lot and it *sucks*. I'm sorry for going on a tangent there haha. And thank you so much for your sympathy&lt;3"
Sounds like it's time to let this guy get a taste of the real world. He thinks he can be a total jerk and still have you wipe his ass for him. Nope yourself right outta that apartment.
"This is absolutely it. I would add that it's also possible they would like to try to convert OP's daughter over to ""their side"" when she's older."
"Counseling for sure, a third party will be really helpful in getting you guys through this.   


Outside of that I think it's important to realize you wounded your wife pretty deeply when you checked out after your first was born. You showed her you were more willing to prioritize yourself when times got hard, and that leads to a lack of trust in addition to feeling like you simply didn't care.  


That wound has probably healed some, but never fully, so any trouble with your son is just poking at it and pouring a little salt in it over and over again. That's why the reactions are escalating. You've already hurt her, and now you just. keep. poking it. The fact that you can admit things *still* are not as equal as they could be means you're still not pulling your weight and she's feeling all over again the pain from that deep wound and the fresh pain from it daily. I don't excuse her behavior fully, yelling is not a productive way to solve anything. But it sounds like she's not getting through to you any other way.   


About the only thing to do outside of counseling is some BIG TIME taking on of more than your share, and finding ways to give you both some relief. Daycare was a good idea here. Outside of that, pick up the slack! You didn't get into how chores and such are handled - I'm assuming since you're home you should being doing the bulk of them (with some leeway knowing there's two little ones around). Don't ask your wife what she needs or what needs to be done. Be proactive. If you're not already, make sure you're on top of things like clothes, food, groceries, appointments (i.e. that you're not also leaving the mental load of the kids to your wife. If you don't know what that is, read  the comic ""You should have asked"" and ""Women aren't Nags - we're just fed up""). You're still in the thick of it. I know you're both exhausted. But if she's working full time AND doing more than 50%, there's no question this resentment is going to keep festering unless you can manage to start pulling more than your share for awhile."
"I can't believe how long it took to find a response like this. OP, you're an adult, fucking deal with it. Kids are annoying and cringey, teenagers especially. Sounds like she has kind of a shitty family situation and she's acting out. You're an adult, fucking deal with it."
"I think you need to start distancing yourself from him. Look to get more involved elseswhere like volunteering locally or trying out some new clubs and make new friends or groups of friends apart from him. People grow apart and you can't make someone grow up with you. 

Maybe it's time to take the kid gloves off and be direct about how his behavior makes you feel."
I've never once had an employer ask about my GPA in college.
"Ugh.  An entitled 25 yo making demands without regard for finances of family, no doubt to have an Instagram worthy wedding, family reunion, and honeymoon?  That marriage is not going to last.  

That said, you and your parents should attend but do not give in to their demands.  The fiancee father has a nerve:   it's his daughter who wants the over the top wedding.  He is the one ""expected"" to pay for the bride's princess party."
"When my BIL was getting married, my MIL was angry that his father (her ex-husband) said he couldn’t make the wedding because it was a destination wedding. My MIL said he had to go because this was his son’s first wedding and he couldn’t ruin his first wedding! I looked at her and said, you mean just his “wedding” right? Not like we’re expecting them to divorce?!! She laughed it off but that’s how she thinks since she’s been married twice and divorced twice. I waited years to tell my BIL and have never told my SIL, she’s amazing and highly doubt they’d ever divorce, they are great together."
"Exactly. The level at which he lacked consideration for his partner's feelings is staggering. My husband occasionally works late at work or goes to hang out with friends after work, but he ALWAYS sends me a text when he's on his way home or gives me an ETA as to when he'll be home to make sure I do not worry. If my husband ever did what OP's boyfriend did to her, I could never trust him again."
"As others have said, it does sound very much as if he is dealing with depression, and in most cases depression does not spontaneously get better; it's a chemical imbalance in the brain, and it requires medical intervention.  So *if* that's what he has, he needs to see a doctor.

As much as you don't want to, you need to make him getting the help he needs (whether that's for depression, or simple counseling or job coaching or what-have-you in order to get him up on his own two feet) a condition of him continuing to live with you.  You need to draw a reasonable line in the sand and tell him that he must be either in treatment, or working and paying rent, but some date in the relatively near future, or he's out.

You're a mom.  I get it.  It will break your heart to even *consider* putting him out.  But your job is not to do what is best for your heart, it's to do what is necessary for your *son*. 

People do what they *want* to do, every single time.  Right now he has a comfortable situation that allows him to remain as he is and not grow, because you are providing everything he needs.  Until he no longer *has* everything he needs, he has no *reason* to change, and so he will not want to change, and so he *will* not change.

You will have to decide whether you are going to do what is *easy* for you, or what is *right* for him."
"Its easy not to regret having kids when you have someone else do all the work of taking care of them. Not saying that's the situation here, it isn't clear to me from OP's post, but your heuristic wouldn't work in a Fun Babysitting Dad/Overworked PPD Mom scenario."
"You have the best comment on here so you’re the one I want to ask, do you have any advice for OP about this post? What if her computer has a keylogger and he knows about it?"
It’s not the protective order that will “ruin” his job it’s his actions. He’s being abusive and escalating. Better to be safe then sorry. You should also change your locks incase he has a key cut etc.
"Still, how many chores are there to do? I obviously don't know how much time total they usually spend on housework, but he already work 50-55 hours, if she works, say 20 hours, then the difference is 30 hours. Usually one person stay at home because there are kids, but without kids, I don't see how someone spends 30 hours just for housework."
"I snapped with my husband about having to go let his mother's 3 dogs out over the weekend not long ago.
It wasn't just the dogs.. It was the final straw in the long line of expectations. Had a leak= ring husband, fix computer= ring husband, need telly plugging back in as they've pulled a cable out= ring husband and on and on and on..... Every night a phonecall or we just had to drop in to sort something. 10 mins turned into 2 hours and once again a late meal and no chance to relax together in the evening or get anything done. We eventually moved over half an hours drive away and they've booked yet another weekend away this year (this is the 4 th one) and they expect us to either stay over or drive back and forth twice a day while they're away. I just lost it. They'd booked the holiday before even askigg and even then they didn't ask, it was just expected to be OK. I said no. It caused a big fight but in the end we comprised, husband let's them out each morning on his way to work and then they pay a pet sitter to come round in the evenings to take them for a walk and bed them down or they go into kennels."
"It seems that it might just be best to be completely honest with her, as it seems she's aware of the effect John has on some people. You can just tell her the next time you're planning something that she's welcome but that John is not (because of his behaviour). She may happily accept and if he then picks up on not being included, he will probably talk to her about it. That's their issue to solve. If he contacts you or anyone else, well, maybe you can agree with all members of this friend group that if he asks you all give the same reply: ""You weren't invited because of your past behaviour on our outings. None of us enjoy spending time around you hence we've decided to no longer include you.""

&amp;#x200B;

It's probably hurtful for him, but he seems the type who lacks any kind of awareness of others and social ques, and whom is never at fault for anything that happens to him. There's no point discussing any of this with him in detail since he'll just be angry/defiant. As long as you all give him the same reply if he asks, then I think you are good."

So your boyfriend is just trash. He takes advantage of you and your family but gives nothing in return.

You can deter some behaviors like jumping on counters...but punishing a cat for being a cat is stupid.

Your boyfriend is stupid. 

I can't believe you're even a little torn here.  You made a commitment to that cat and your boyfriend is telling you HE ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE.  

 If you can't or won't ensure the cat is in a safe and stable home, please find it a new home."
"Yeah and allowing any sort of relationship to develop just leaves a crack in the door for every shit parent's siren call of ""grandparent rights""."
"Not to mention they might be interested in daughter because they don’t realize OP is with a woman. When OP said daughter they probably jumped to the conclusion that she’s with a man, and therefore no longer in that “leSBiAn LiFEstYLe”. Might also see daughter and new baby as links back into OP’s life where they can control her again and bring her back. 

Hold your ground OP, these narcs have not changed and coming in contact with them will probably lead to a legal battle if they get to know your daughter or your soon to be born child and they would probably argue that “she’s ruining their lives because she’s gay!” bullshit. Your sister can deal with these whack jobs, you’ve had your choice made when they didn’t accept you and now, after 7 years of NC, only want your kids; do not engage soldier, fall back."
"We talked about unwanted pregnancies before we started having sex and he said abortions were situational. I know he's not against having them, but I don't know what his mindset will be when put in that situation. He's a good man, and he loves me very much, so I think it will be okay."
"This is the simplest explanation but if his girlfriend can’t trust this explanation then the relationship is broken anyway. I (m) often share a flat with women and this requires some level of trust with my girlfriend but she is never jealous and never jumps to these conclusions. I recommend finding a partner who doesn’t accuse you of relationship breaking things over such a situation. If she doesn’t calm down soon then you can only assume you’re going to have future issues, just as instincts seem to tell as he’s already considered breaking up over this."
"Your wife needed you at the hardest point of her life and you abandoned her. Her thoughts are going to be completely around the next time a situation comes around where you're needed when life gets hard. You've shown that you'll bail.

"&gt; At breakfast the next day she acted like nothing had happened. She made a few jokes about his temper and asked me how my relationship is, talked small talk.

This is the cycle of abuse. He apologized, she feels bad for him, wants to pretend this is normal and OK, has probably normalized it herself to a degree. She is working hard to convince herself it wasn't as bad as she knows, deep down, that it is.

I know you wanted to help but I don't understand texting J while you knew her husband was beating her. How was she supposed to check her messages? Then you left her alone and went to help her abuser. It's really fucking weird.

B is going to kill her one day. He's strangled her; that's the No. 1 indicator. He is also not afraid to beat her with you listening. He's a fucking monster. Stay away from him and offer J help if/when she wants to get out.

If you ever encounter this type of situation again, you call the police. If B threatens to kill himself, you call the police.

This is going to end really badly, and probably with J dead, B dead or both of them. This is as fucking bad as it gets. 

Has J gotten any medical attention? While you were off fetching B, did she see a doctor? Why was she throwing up? What the hell did he do to her to cause that? First and foremost, you need to urge her to see a doctor, even though it's after the fact. 

&gt; . I haven’t answered any of B’s texts, I am sickened by him and have no interest in keeping the friendship, especially after realizing how much of a charmer he is, and why.

Be careful. If you end the friendship outright, he could blame J and she could be in for another beating. ""Look what you made happen."" That's the abuser mindset. This guy is a real piece of shit. I might play along for a while to get him to calm down and keep her safe (and potentially try to help her get out)."
"Your mother is a classic bully. If you do not want her to continue bullying you, then do not reward or enable bullying behavior. 

My answer would be very different if she were willing to apologize for disowning you or even if she were to say something like ""you're still my daughter and I love you, I hope we can let bygones be bygones"" (which is, incidentally, what ""meeting in the middle"" would probably be like). But she's trying to bully you the same as always. 

Unless you want your wife and daughter to have to deal with a bully in their lives, you really have no choice but to tell her to pound sand."
"And, it must be said, someone who will still think he ""did good"" if you one day don't look like you do right now, but still *are who you are*. I met my husband as a varsity athlete and personal trainer. Now I have a hugely demanding desk job and work out maybe twice a week if I win the overtime lottery. And I've popped out a couple of his kids since then! I don't even really want to imagine what he sees on the pillow next to him when he wakes up in the morning - she's probably drooling around her night-grinding mouth guard and has a toddler foot in her face - a different species than the Amazon he fell in love with.

But I'm still me - his smart, driven, ride or die partner for 15 years. He still did good, and so did I. The right partner will want to grow and evolve alongside you, not freeze you in amber on the 3rd day of a pre-comp cut to ensure that they'll always feel good *about themselves* when they look at you."
"You’re right, you shouldn’t want to push your guy into marriage. My husband as well as my brother and another guy friend have all said, when people asked them about their proposal story, that as soon as they had a ring, it was like it was burning a hole in their pocket and couldn’t wait to propose. Hanging onto it this long, I can guarantee that he’s not into it."
"1) It's your parents job to make sure their pets are taken care of, not yours. So do not feel guilty for saying no. 

2) Does your wife feel like your parents know you are waiting on HER answer to respond to them? Because that's a fucking shitty feeling. Make sure you are NOT making her the bad guy in this situation. 

3) Asking someone to stay at your house and watching your ill/elderly pets is A BIG ASK. Even if it's only once a year for a few nights. Maybe your wife doesn't like sleeping alone? Maybe she doesn't get any good sleep those nights and so she dreads your being gone. Do you have kids? pets? You aren't just volunteering your time when you agree, you are volunteering to fuck up her schedule as well."
I'd follow my dream or I'd always regret it and become resentful. Especially if I was in my 20s and there were frequent arguments in my relationship already.
"No one is entitled to a vacation. The only reason to include/exclude someone is whether the paying party wants the person to be there or not. I would never invite someone I don't like on my vacation. If they want a vacation, they can do it themselves."
"It sounds like you do things that remind him of his girlfriend. He is mentioning her regularly and that should be a signal to you. But not a signal that he shares your feelings. Generally if a guys mentions his girlfriend regularly, it means he likes her. If he never mentioned her. If it makes you uncomfortable tell him so he stops."
"It’s honestly gross to be so entitled, and then on top of it use some “modern woman” argument to support your own laziness and lack of compassion. 

Like, she’d rather you spend your free time cleaning than hanging out with her? Or cleaning rather than getting much needed rest from, providing for her??? What more does she want from you??"
"No phone can automatically install an old app when updating. That is definitely a lie. He either never deleted it (although 3 years is a long time to keep a dating app if you're in a relationship) or he recently reinstalled it. Both would indicate that he's not happy with some aspect of the relationship. You have to bring it up with him and discuss. Don't go in all accusatory, maybe lead with asking how he feels the relationship is going and take it from there."
"&gt;His fiancé also sent me a long and expensive list of clothing I need to have fitted and purchase as a groomsman

I'm assuming he means for the wedding? Tux/suit of some sort? That's not strange at all, in fact that sounds pretty reasonable if you agree to be a groomsmen"
"I'm sure there are things YOU want to have done before marriage: a wedding budget, a timeline for children to assure you are both on the same page before committing to each other, a talk about ""what, if anything, do you think will change in our relationship once we're married?""

Maybe start with the things YOU want to accomplish or complete before getting married.  Then ask him, ""what do you want to accomplish before we get married?""  

This can help you gauge the concrete things he needs done so you can talk timelines with a reference point such as a raise, living together a certain amount of time, whatever he also sees as immediately important.

If he doesn't have anything concrete and is just waffling, you may want to consider talking to a couple's counselor together.   They can help you flesh out what you both want and when to decide if your ideas and hopes can align."
"Ding ding ding.

I've been through this exact scenario, even down to the type of lies being told."
just wanted to say that this is the best comment ive read it a while. really on point imo.
She doesn't sound like much of a friend.  Keep her blocked and move on.   Good for you for standing up for yourself and leaving.
Tell him in a public place.
"I think what she's actually hoping for is that all will be forgiven once they see each other again.  In the real world that isn't so simple, obviously."
"It sounds like a lot of these demands were last minute expenses, the clothing included. OP, can you clarify when you were given this list of clothing? 

Your comment isn't helpful to OP at all. 

OP, have a heart to heart with your brother. Dont come at him with anger and I agree with the other user who said not to involve what your parents said, and make it about you. Encourage your parents to discuss this with your brother separately.

Frankly, I think this bride is dumb for trying to do a destination wedding and a family reunion at the same time. I can see how that would save costs for her family, but it seems like OPs family is getting the short end of the stick and paying for the bride's family's piss poor planning. This girl s bridezilla for sure and I wouldn't blame OP or his family if they decided not to go to the wedding because it's basically a family reunion that the bride is trying to make her husband-to-be's family pay for half of."
"I  don't think that she should tell him that she's going to the police to report it. All that will do is give him the opportunity to lie to her and then remove the tracker.  If she goes to the police without telling him, the police can remove the tracker and follow the proper procedures so that it can be used as evidence in court.

She should also ask the police if they can look for tracking software on her phone and spyware on her other devices."
"Bad idea!! You tie yourself to him legally and only then find out if he’s a nightmare to live with. Or that you don’t get on living together. 

Seriously, what he’s saying makes no sense."
"U can do it, Beesley"
"$200 sounds like it might include hair. I own a salon, and we charge $250 for both."
He's 32 and doesn't earn enough to rent his own place. And has audacity to tell you you don't clean enough. Real gem that one.
"Ok.  I'm reading through your post here.  Let's address everything you say she's doing wrong. 

Excuses actions with ''just moody today'' 

Actions you are upset about

1. Gives up instead of fighting with you (this is you treating her badly)

2. Asks you to leave when you start fighting with her (according to you she doesn't fight back)

3. puts down your goals (are these goals constantly changing, are they the source of your one sided fights?)

4. What's you to confide in her but doesn't let you confide in her (not sure how this works, maybe an example would help explain)

5. Being 'empty' (what?)

6. Not helping when I need her to (with what exactly?)

7. Won't go out of her way to spend time with you.  (When she's refusing to argue with you and asking you to leave or some other time? )

Now this post, she yells at you for ''something I say or do''

I'm getting a real clear picture here of you going to spend time with a very passive person, picking fights, and being very mad when they refuse to fight you and ask you to leave. And that most of these fights you pick are centered on your words and actions that warrant yelling at you in offensiveness.

She isn't abusing you by refusing to fight with you, or asking you to leave her alone, she isn't abusing you by not solving your problems you expect her to be able to solve when your both teenagers with no life experience. And romantic telekinesis are not at all a place to get help. The only thing you've said that's a legitimate complaint about her and not you mad she isn't a better victim of your abuse is her ''putting down your goals'' and I'm REALLY not sure I believe you that that's actually happening. I wouldn't be surprised if your ''goals'' are flights of fancy or constantly shifting and arbitrary. 

Look having a health condition doesn't dictate how others MUST treat you. It doesn't justify you being abused mind you, but it also doesn't mean you are free to abuse others. It really sounds like you shouldn't be in a relationship right now. You should really beer focused on getting your condition medicated and figuring out how to live with it so it doesn't ruin your life and personal relationships. 

The positive here is you know what the problem is.  I went through a lot if nightmare toxic relationships at your age and never saw I was the problem until much later, you have your chance here to work on this outside a relationship and figure something out before you ruin the next several relationships. But right now, your just hurting another person."
"Yeah, wtf? The wedding is in a month and he hasn't gotten fitted for/ordered his outfit yet? That's usually something you need to do months prior..."
This /is/ a middle ground. Not a middle ground would be no pet sitting for the parents ever. Another example of middle ground would be he spends only one night instead of every night. It really depends on why his wife is upset.
Especially as she only sees her dad a month out of the year and is reacting to her time with him being threatened.  She may feel like he is going to replace her with a whole new family.  It is their job to reassure her they will love her no matter what
"&gt;Honestly, I'd be frank with your sister. She's not at fault here, and likely just doesn't understand the severity of all this.  

I think this needs to be reiterated"
"definitely very common, but OP is female, so im not sure how relevant that is to this situation."
"It wasn't really that but yes! ""low key, at home"" was the point.

I'm just doubling down- OP's bf doesn't have to rent 100 doves and get a flash mob and her whole family and an airplane to write ""will you marry me"" in the sky. Just ask. Especially if you jointly picked out the ring."
"I think people with significant others do this as a way to subtly draw boundaries.  Reminding you constantly that he gas a partner doesn't sound like a way to flirt, but a way to remind you he is not available."
"&gt; Sending videos of your new home is a bit more normal to me

I did not take ""showing off his downtown penthouse"" to mean the same thing as you."
Honestly this is not a tough decision so I'm surprised you even had to post. Cut this person out of your life or slowly distance yourself from them. Not that difficult honestly.
"As you said, none of your business. So why did you feel it was necessary to comment about your feelings on same-sex couples with kids?"
"I disagree somewhat with what a lot of people are saying. I think people from all walks of life are compatible regardless of their hobbies and passions. You could easily meet your type of woman in a club or a bar or anywhere.

 I think perhaps don't limit yourself to a fantasy of a girl with exactly the same interests while ticking all other boxes you have. You probably limit your options so severely and then if someone comes along who ticks every single box you will be too anxious to not mess it up you'll probably come across weirdly.

Just live your life and be open and someone great will come along at some point, and have fun in the meantime, you are still young.

That being said, if you don't enjoy going to bars or clubs and just go to pick up women you probably won't end up liking much, just don't go. Do things you like and there will be plenty of women about.

Probably some of the girls you dismiss as vapid or something in a club are dnd nerds who look at you and think you are some vapid jock who just wants to get laid. Just keep yourself open and give all kinds of women a chance."
Depends on the market.  National Average for hair and makeup for a bridesmaid in the US is \~$125. If they are in a high cost area - yeah $200 for hair and makeup.
"CreditKarma and CreditSesame are free.  They send me alerts when an inquiry has been made on my credit.  I have an Excel spreadsheet I use every month with all my bills on it and I mark each one off with the date it's paid.  Start of each month, I clear the date paid and start over again.  I am rarely surprised about what money I have at any moment.  I have my bank balance and credit usage available at all times.  I also have a column for my credit scores which I check at least once a month."
"You've been on three dates, just take it easy. Make plans with friends and get more socially active so you aren't giving yourself the space to just sit and obessess over how you are acting. Just be you, do what you like to do, if you like her, keep seeing her."
"You gained weight because you're stressed. It's not her fault. Blaming this on her being pregnant will not help you in any way.

Her pregnancy sounds extremely difficult and she is unwell. 

Get yourself into therapy and learn how to manage your anxiety and self-loathing."
"Yes, I am generally the person who organizes the social outings and get togethers. Nobody else in my friend group actually ever hung out with Anna, even when they were all in high school together (this is despite the small graduating classes, which tended to be around 25-40 people per year). 

This is how I've justified not inviting her to things that these other people from her town get invited to, but the fact remains that I used to invite them to things with this group, before everyone realized they couldn't be around John. If I wasn't in the picture, I know she wouldn't be hanging out with anyone in the group.

I agree with you, I think there are a lot of ways that it could go south if I try to be honest with her. I know she's already lost friendships over John, and this is with people she's been close to since childhood. 

Here's an example of an upcoming event that I'd feel bad about not inviting her to: my courthouse wedding. My fiance and I would like an actual wedding in a year or so, but doing it legally makes sense right now for various reasons. My local friends want to be there, and I want them there also. But it's a little more awkward to not invite her to something like that, since it's about me and my fiance, who are somewhat of the link between her and everyone else. But I definitely do not want to spend my day with John, after he spent twenty minutes telling me that I'm ruining my actual wedding day by getting legally married beforehand.

It's for that reason that I feel like I have to even keep my small wedding plans a secret from Anna. Even if I say, ""yeah look I'm not interested in having John there after what he said,"" I run the risk of dealing with that fallout. And that sucks, having to hang out with someone that I feel I can't be honest with about my plans."
"Agreed don’t listen to his word at all. He can have access , to back to keys or get a tech to help reset the system for only you and confirm with your lock company that this is accurate. 

He’s obviously good with technology so him entering your house seems pretty easy"
I love this term. I dislike egg donor and sperm donor since  some actually donor conceived people don’t like that term and I feel like it’s used more among discontented exes than abused children. I think a lot of people in the fog think they will treat their kids differently but they only want contact for attention and to play games to hurt the kids and grandkids eventually.
"He's trying to make you feel guilty so you will give in and give him what he wants. A couch is a want, not a need. You are doing the right thing here. Stay strong."
"During the conversation months ago about this I told him ""you could literally throw the box at my f'ing forehead and I'll be ecstatic."" Any crazy over the top plans are 100% in his head.  After reading all of these replies and really thinking about it,  I'm really leaning towards he just is not into this anymore.  Thanks for taking the time to give your two cents. I appreciate it!"
"Just out of curiosity, why did your father kick you guys out? Do you think your brother has some abandonment issues that makes him require a parent figure?"
"Oh wow!  I wonder how many people who privacy he's invaded especially if it's using malicious software.  That's criminal and it really makes me wonder what else he's gotten himself into.  

I don't know why he told you unless someone discovered him and he's trying to make amends now?  Maybe he's having a psychotic break because of the stress?

I honestly believe you need to stay as far away from this man as possible and truly look into contacting the authorities."
"If you don't protect your cat from this dude, you shouldn't be a pet owner either. Period."
"If he really wanted to, he’d have figured it out by now."
i think you need to own your agency in this and figure out why you want to do this act cause i have no idea why you actually want to besides your parents asking you too.
"I've also been in 3 weddings and had to pay for my own dress, shoes, hair and makeup (if I wanted it done professionally) every time, and was told specifically what to buy. I was also expected to buy/pitch in on gifts for the wedding itself and the bridal shower, and cover my travel costs and alterations."
"Sorry to hijack this comment. It is obvious it is more like her and her family wedding, and they are asking others to chip in for their family reunion/wedding. How is it fair? Talk to the brother. If he won't speak up, then obviously he is willing to bend over for his wife and her family."
"I totally agree.

If nothing else, OP, you have learned that you and your husband just can't cohabit."
"""Listen, if I was cheating on you I wouldn't have saved this for you to see even if I thought it might actually be yours.""

But no, I don't think your previous fear of commitment is important. Good on you for recognizing and being ok with this possibly being over."
"It definitely sounds like this. Something probably set OP’s bf off, but rather than discussing it with her he’s being passive aggressive about it. Most likely because it’s something stupid, like the hilarious examples that you’ve written lol, so it will sound stupid if he says it out loud. 

In my experience, with people like this, they want you to be a mind reader. They don’t want to have to say it because “you should know what you did”. OP asking him why he was in a bad mood probably just made him more annoyed. Basically, he’s being very immature and doesn’t know how to communicate his feelings properly."
"This is obviously disingenuous. Your father is being taken advantage of. Tell that woman to get lost. The poor man is in his nineties, she’s just trying to get money out of him."
"There has to be more to this story about why you moved out and how you handled it. Paying to cover rent and utilities is one thing. What you said and how you acted likely have to do with why they're done with you. You mention that the one friend that is still sort of talking to you said it seems like you wanted to burn bridges. You also admit to having outbursts. I would guess there is a lot more of your behavior that you have omitted from this post, and whatever went down related to you moving out was the straw that broke the camel's back for these people."
Just ask for her number. Whatever she thinks she is probably going to think anyways. You can make it sound more casual though. Just say something like “Hey maybe we could hang out sometime. Could I get your number?”
"So glad you posted this as I was thinking the same thing. Calling the cops could get her killed. And the most dangerous time for a woman in an abusive relationship is often when she leaves. OP’s friend needs help and support, but this has to be handled delicately as it’s literally as the stakes are literally life and death."
"&gt; since he is still moving to Scotland

I bet he's not even getting divorced. 

You can tell her you are not going to pretend to like him or pretend that this is a good idea. You are still her friend and you will still be there for her, but you are not going to lie to her about how you feel."
"I would also recommend not reminding the sister that they have not apologized since she might continue the family circus thinking that apology is all that is needed to make you all close again, therefore adding more drama. I would just say to her in a direct and firm way that they hurt you and never apologized, and a condition of your current happiness is emotional and physical distance from them. If she continues to bring it up, just remind her that you have already said your piece and you do not need to discuss it further."
This is a good point! I hope OP sees it.
"One thing you don't mention is if he is receiving palliative care treatment? If so, have y'all discussed this with his palliative care team? Is the benefit of this drug worth the diminished quality of life for him and for you?? I understand that there is traditionally a weaning period for this drug but a palliative care physician may better understand that your BF is working on a different timescale and can intervene with his neurologists and oncologists.

If your BF doesn't have a palliative care team, I highly highly recommend it. A close family member of mine was diagnosed with terminal cancer and her palliative team is fighting in her corner for best quality of life."
"&gt;only responds with one word answers, never begins a conversation, constant tirades.

Which is it?

I'm getting a real unreliable narrator feel here."
"this should be higher up! Move on! This guy not only isn't interested in marrying you but he's being actively dishonest and holding you back from what you want out of life! If that doesn't scream ""he's not the right guy for you,"" what else will it take? 

It's really hard to leave someone you've loved for 5 years. But you two clearly want different things out of life. Don't keep waiting for him to be your future husband. Your future husband is out there looking for you right now!"
"Also if he is intending to be a groomsman he should have ordered his clothes months ago. A month would make me nervous too. That said, bride and groom are still ridiculous obviously."
"Turn the WiFi off. 
Start charging rent. 
Sign him up for counselling etc 
Insist he gets up everyday &amp; takes a walk etc 

Get your other family go help support you in YOUR plan. Make deadlines and stick to them. 

You can do this."
"Lol fuck no. This guy isn’t harassing her over that pittance. He’s harassing her because she’s seen who he really is and he can’t stand the idea of her walking around free of his control, knowing just how ugly he can get. That shit drives abusers *nuts*. 

OP, do not contact him. At all. Stay 100% away from him. Do not meet up to give him *closure*, to get a belonging back, to “hear his side of the story.” No excuse is worth putting yourself back within arm’s reach of this man. It could literally cost you your life."
"This. 

This was not a “fling”, OP. You **cheated**. You do not have any respect for your current partner, period. Nobody who acts the way you have can claim otherwise. The only integrity move you can make right now is to tell her what you did and accept the consequences as they come. 

This other woman, by the way, is a fantasy. Nothing you feel for this other person is real. She is a not only a perfect stranger to you, but she also allowed herself to get involved with someone who is engaged. That should key you in that she doesn’t have much of a character, either."
"Why do you think Lex (who sounds like a very nice, down to earth girl) will ""force you to choose""?

And even if she did, why would you want to be friends with these absolute losers?"
"No, he's your friend, your platonic friend."
"You're a stay at home dad, why don't you take the lead on getting the kids used to sleeping in their own beds? Your wife works a demanding job, she probably doesn't have the patience to deal with them when she's ready to sleep."
"Yes. While I’m sure OP loves him, and I’m sure he really is a great guy with some very unfortunate medical circumstances, that doesn’t mean OP is obligated to stick around in an abusive relationship, especially given that it’s already escalated to physical violence and likely will again."
I think she was frustrated that you are putting off going to the doctor while there is an infant in the house that you could infect and didn't actually think you'd book a hotel rather than going to the doctor. Hence her reaction when you actually did it.
"Yes, I will go get checked for that right away! I was doing some research, and ectopic pregnancies are terrifying."
"Or learn how to say ""no."""
"He's wrong, you can't train cats like that. I couldn't leave my pet around someone I couldn't trust."
"Well, to answer your question (I know it may be too little too late), they ask me to spend the night because he has issues going up and down stairs by himself sometimes. He has fallen before, and we just don’t want that to happen again. I understand everyone saying “put up a baby gate he’ll be fine, problem solved” yadda yadda. I’ve gotten many replies about that. 

I think they just want me to be around as much as possible, I understand he is on his own during the day, but they always come home that night and are there with him. 

I’ve grown up with him, and he knows me. As a sick/old dog, I think they just want me to be around as much as possible (hence staying the night) would be helpful and help him be less stressed. His primary caregivers are already going to be out, at least he knows me and is familiar with me. 

That’s why. I know it’s easy to say “just put the baby gate up and leave him” but it’s really not that simple. Dogs especially are very connected to their owners, people, etc. it’s not that easy or simple to leave him like that. Not to mention my newly blind, aids infected cat."
"I agree with the other commenters who say that your wife is attempting to isolate and control you.

Your spouse should be happy that you have found a social activity that you enjoy and that helps you manage your depression. Her first instinct should be to *support* your participation in those DnD sessions, to encourage you to go and to ask you about how they went. This is what a loving partner in a healthy relationship would do  in this situation.

Instead she demands that you be home whenever she is. That is not healthy, and her making you feel bad about not being home is manipulative - a way to make you stop doing it.

She is an adult and your wife, not someone you babysit; there is no reason why you should always be home and available to her. She can entertain herself, do her own chores, go shopping or out with friends or whatever, while you're playing DnD.

So you actually shouldn't see where she's coming from when she disapproves of your games. If you spend time together on other days, you not being home for one evening a week when she is not a big deal. That it is in your relationship shows that she is very controlling. Controlling and especially isolating one's partner is a sign of abuse. A partner who loves you in a healthy way doesn't want to isolate you from other healthy social relationships.

It sounds like DnD is very good for you - I play it too and agree that it's a good way to make friends and socialise and to have a creative outlet. Please take some time to think what it really means that your wife wants to stop you going to the game groups."
"Another poster summed it up pretty well.  you deal with:

\- mom died

\- dad kicked you out immediately

\- brother manipulates and gaslights you

\- lived at home til late 20s.

\- anger issues

&amp;#x200B;

If someone said, ""Sure, i've got chronic chest pain, i have headaches every day, i fought in vietnam and was exposed to agent orange, and i have an open gash across my left calf...but i don't need to see a doctor"" i think youd agree that person was, at best...very wrong.  wouldnt you?"
You’re risking a full ride so you don’t offend your offensive friend ?
"This is a great piece of advice for a less extreme situation than OP’s, but I’m afraid for her husband his lack of care for any adult responsibility in his life may be too far gone."
"OP, your dad is an enabler. And a coward. He may love you but he loves himself more. Look, I’m the parent of a son as well. And because I’m his mother, he comes first always. There is no man in this world that would EVER come before my son and I actually ended things with his father because he wouldn’t get help for his issues and endangered my son. One time but that was enough, he was gone. I’m sure it’s easy to imagine your father as the “good guy” because he’s not actively abusive like your mother but he is neglectful and has failed to provide his son a safe home environment. You need to get out of there. 15 is such a critical age and you need to be in a healthy environment. You need to be stable on your medication and receiving regular therapy. You don’t want to be like me and carrying trauma and unhealthy coping mechanisms into adulthood. Can you stay with a friend? Or even a shelter? I’m sure there’s resources for transitioning teens in abusive homes especially."
"I’ve always found the best way to get over a crush is to ask the person out and find out where they stand. As long as it’s ambiguous you can delude yourself into thinking it might happen and that keeps the crush alive. 

For what it’s worth, I basically only regularly watch the insta-stories of women I find attractive. It doesn’t mean I want to date then all per se, but I am attracted to them."
I think you are taking the words too literal.
"I’m so glad you said this.. This should be at the top of the comments. honestly it amazes me when people express things like this on here &amp; are so oblivious. He is cheating emotionally &amp; wants to physically. If he wanted to be committed to his relationship he would have never even considered sharing a bedroom. 

OP, have respect for yourself."
"I disagree. I'm 27 and have been married to my husband for years, and he is still a pain in my ass, he he's my pain in the ass, and I love him with everything I've got. Lol."
"I just added an edit to my comment.  I actually do do psychedelics.  And while I might commit a weekend to that experience and put my phone away, I would sure as hell communicate that to a partner beforehand.  And check in after. It's a ridiculous excuse, compounded by lying. And the worst part is the OP is worried this has something to do with her trust issues.  This is just plain shitty behaviour from a 'partner'."
"He steals your meds because he doesnt care about your well-being. He is not trustworthy. ""BF, don't ever go near my meds again. I need them to stay well, and it is totally unacceptable for you to take them."" Then lock them up so he can't have access to them (or break up with him)."
"That gives me a leg to stand on in defending my feelings on this more than you know. I want the world for her. And this shit would not fly. Huge thank you for this perspective. 

And I totally agree that the pressure is real. I know I feel it. But I don't want to feel it anymore. He wasn't some troglodyte going to sleazy places when I married him. And my standards are still the same. So I hear what you're saying in making sure I remember to watch my own ass in this situation instead of worrying about his feelings."
"I'm kind of with you on this one. Your friend sounds shady af. I'd be suspicious too. Your boyfriend seems, by your description,  to have an honest and shocked reaction."
"I noticed that too. I think it's important for parents to get some form of time away from the baby, and it doesn't sound like OP is getting that at all, and his wife very little."
"&gt;I genuinely don't know if I'm in the right or wrong.

Honestly it sounds like it's not working out.  He doesn't seem very invested in the relationship. You're not happy, and he's not doing anything to make you happy.

Though one good thing about the situation is that it sounds like you don't have to change it up right away.  If it doesn't make sense to walk out now (for a variety of possible reasons) you can start making contingency plans while you go through the motions.  Then if things don't get better you can leave when you're ready to go.  And there's always a chance that he'll notice that you don't seem very invested any more either.  And maybe he'll come around."
"Considering that the wedding is just an ""add-on"" to the reunion, it's going to be a shitshow no matter what.  Your family should not be subsidizing the fiancee's family reunion!  Wouldn't blame your family for bowing out now. It's too bad your brother has let all this happen but you/your family should not be paying the literal price for it. :/"
"Then why did you come here.  Also I agree with the other person who said those people were idiots and you should ignore them.

Are you fishing for a response that is something along the lines of *Exact revenge then publicly and flamboyantly purge them from your life!!*  Like what's the endgame here?"
"My (male) partner is absurdly good at emotional labor, even better than me (a lady). However, he had a weird childhood where  both of his parents were just not great. So in many ways he became the parent. I have dated men though who need to be babied. And guess what? Their moms did it all and never gave them chores, would call them to remind things like change the oil, etc. And they then expected me to do the same. It was so refreshing to meet my partner. We both do shit, and frequently without having to even discuss it. Oh, dishes in the sink? We just take care of it. Sometimes one of us will ask us to say sweep and mop the floors as a team because one of us is just ready for it to get done. But a lot of dudes just never learn. Anyway, I am going to leave a love note in my partners lunch."
I am surprised the dad asked him first and did not open a CC on his bank
"Just stop hanging out with him.

""I can't have a repeat of last year.  If you can't change I'm going to stop hanging out with you.""

You don't need to take the shit's feelings into consideration when you are flushing it."
"I'm being a little harsh with my wording, I don't mean that. I mean more along the lines of we're finishing a meal at a nice restaurant, and I ask if she wants dessert and she says no. But on the way home, ""oh, coldstone! Let's get cold stone!"" And my response is ""you're a pain in the butt"" and then we get coldstone because I love her"
"&gt;I asked him why he'd been in such a bad mood on the bus ride on the way home and he just said he's not in a bad mood and basically he doesn't know what I mean.

I've found that calling out ""bad moods"" isn't usually helpful, or at least not as helpful as less-defensive phrases like ""Hey, are you doing ok? For the last week or so, you've seemed different, like something's bothering you and zapping your patience. Just wanted to check in and see what's going on. Is there something I can help with?'

Another method is to let him know you want to talk about it later, which has worked well for me with my husband, because it gives him time to think about it. On my way to work, I might drop a ""Hey, I've noticed you seem annoyed or short with me lately, and I don't have time to talk about it now, but just wanted to let you know I'd like to talk about it after work if you want to think about it a bit. Anyway, love you, see you later.""

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of how you bring it up, I'd utilize ""I feel"" statements here. Instead of focusing on ""you did XYZ and ZYX and YXZ,"" try ""I felt hurt when you rolled your eyes at me about the weed thing, and that's not a feeling I'm used to when I'm around you."""
Yeah is he an app developer for the cia? What a bunch of bullshit. I’d be his own fault anyway but this will not affect his career so op needs to not even waste more time worrying about that.
"The next step is when he tells you they ""might have slept in the same bed but nothing happened"""
"Downthread he says how she expects the bathrooms cleaned 2x a week, vacuuming every other day, lawn mowed 2x a week. She’s entirely unreasonable."
"There's no reason to believe this is true, it's far more likely she's just hiding it from OP.

The sister thinks that *OP* is the one causing problems in their family, and that if OP could just be a doormat and start kissing their parents collective asses again there wouldn't be anymore problems.  This says nothing about whether the sister has told their parents her plans, wherever the sister might have already told the parents, whether the sister expects OP to show up for Christmas with the kid and bells on and leaving her wife at home so they can all just pretend that OP isn't gay while parading her kid around homophobic ""family"" that will intentionally or unintentionally tell the kid things that are horrible.

If the sister wants to be part of OP's life, she needs to understand that there is no longer a relationship between OP and her disgusting family, and that her parents are the reason for the entire situation, not OP.  [""Rocking the boat""](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/) sucks emotionally - but it's absolutely necessary when gross, judgemental family members choose their random incompatible-with-reality beliefs over their family."
"Dont move in with her mom, this will not end well."
"This 100% 

Also men almost always stick together regardless and fall easily to the abusers charms."
"Yea, it's definitely something to think about and even 2 out of 2000 is too many. But common can mean a lot of different things and I don't want every single person to start freaking out thinking their boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife put gps trackers on their car."
Then he may never move out.
"The longer you enable his dependence on you with no effort to address his depression, lack of job experience, and lack of social contact, the worse a place you're going to leave him in when you are no longer able to.

The only way you can do anything positive for him, especially in the long run, is to find it in yourself to do that."
"YUP. 

I dunno if ""emo kids"" are still a thing with this generation but if not it sounds like she's basically the equivalent of that.

13 year olds are annoying know-it-alls whose sole purpose in life is to push boundaries and see how much they can get away with. 

My Dad adopted three young boys, one who is now 13. He (my Dad) and his wife are pulling their hair out over his ""terrible"" behaviour, which includes things like: searching the house to find, take and eat hidden candy, not doing his homework, trying to get out of doing chores and \*gasp\* staying up too late. Every time my Dad tells me how much they're 'struggling' with him my go-to response is, ""That doesn't sound AT ALL like something you ever had to deal with, with &lt;sister&gt; and I."" (with a heavy dose of sarcasm)

Plus on top of simply being 13, she's been taken away from her friends and plopped down at her Dad's house for a month during the summer to apparently just hang around the house during the day. She's probably bored out of her mind."
"His story is not plausible. He's still lying.

Going missing for 2 days without telling you if he was even alive should be an automatic dump. Lying about being in an accident is even worse.

Nothing about this is right."
"She seems to be writing it off as...oh ""he's on the spectrum"" as if animal abuse is excusable.

If he is literally incapable of NOT ABUSING the cat...she needs to rehome him or the cat."
"Honestly, him locking the cat up would be breakup territory for me. The fact that he repeatedly refuses to listen to you or respect your boundaries when it comes to your animal and actively blames you for what are his actions is breakup territory.

Some cats do not like to be picked up. A cat that is locked in a crate for scratching will not associate being locked up with 'punishment.' The fact that he keeps ignoring her obvious signals of 'do not do this' is only going to make her more nervous around him.

As a last ditch effort I'd recommend watching some videos on cat behaviour with him (Jackson Galaxy, Helpful Vancouver Vet), or even taking him to the vet with you to get the vet to say it to him. 

But seriously. This kind of total overstepping of boundaries and reluctance to respect or listen to you is a huge fucking red flag."
"Not really, but most couples see each other MUCH more than once a week. Once a week is what I'd almost call casual dating, not a long term and committed relationship.

You went from living separate lives and coming together every now and again, to seeing each other 24/7.

Seeing someone once a week is exciting. I think you guys just jumped into too much too soon and had no idea what being with each other is actually like, in any serious capacity."
I was mormon no longer mormon. But I this is probably why he continues to want to work on the marriage. The church messes with you.
"If I had to guess, I'd say your wife dislikes sleeping alone, considering that's basically the only time you're actually taking away from her. That or she doesn't like walking your dog alone in evening?"
The way my ex bf treated me at home and we went out were two different ways. When went places he would leave me alone and be a social butterfly. Never introduce me and leave me by myself. In the end he just didn't respect me or my feelings. It got worse and started happening at home. Its over now.
"Go to therapy. Your stress is valid but also, your wife isn't your counselor. She's having a pregnancy that sounds like hell. Having a child isn't easy and you're going to have to rely on each other once the child arrives so maybe get some help before your marriage possibly falls apart."
"don't do the dumb thing and believe him. You're smarter than that. He's lying. Op, if you want to confirm it, ask him to open up the app and login. See when the matches were made."
"Honestly, I would just cut the internet to the house and get the locks changed to key only ones. Who knows what sort of hidden cameras and other shit he has in there that he could just decide to start using again on a whim. Either that, or you let him move back in and you move somewhere else, but I wouldn't do that without talking with a lawyer. And get the protective order. He can totally go back on his word and start tracking/harassing/controlling you and having additional legal protection will help a lot when (not if) he escalates again.

I would also ask someone for help with your phone and online stuff. If I were in your shoes, I would be changing the carrier and the number and even the actual phone (if he rooted it, an erase might not prevent him from accessing it again). And you need to go lock down any and all online accounts you have with 2-factor authentication with the new phone number, especially Facebook and Google accounts, which are used for authentication for a ton of other things. If he has them under his control, you may have to create new accounts."
"He literally doesn’t want to hear what you say so he mentally erases it before it can be absorbed. He is actively fighting against you and it sounds like he doesn’t like you. It’s unlikely he will change. I would get out. 

I’m sorry this is happening to you and your children."
"&gt;Plus they are only 10 mins away from my house.

So there is no logistical reason you need to sleep there, you just...do."
"&gt;Sure, OP's parents aren't being the most considerate of his time, but speaking purely of that relationship, it frankly doesn't matter as long as OP has no problem with it; nobody is being taken advantage of. 

OP's wife *does* feel she's being taken advantage of because she's left alone with her house/pets though."
Paying for dinner does not excuse taking advantage of you when it comes to groceries. The controlling and selfish behavior is an underlying problem though. You should probably seriously examine why you're with him and if this is the kind of relationship you want to continue in.
gotta note that this sister hasn't spilled any details so far which is a good sign eg she didn't spill that OP got married
"I went through almost this exact same thing. Finding pictures of an ex, freaking out about it, him promising to delete them(I believe that he did), then I would look her up on social media and obsess over how much better looking I thought she was than me and how he could even want to be with me. It was awful..... 

Block her. On everything. Don't even give yourself the option of looking at her profiles. It isn't healthy. It took me a long time to get over it internally, but just cutting off the option of obsessing helped a lot. 

Also don't self sabotage and make a problem where there isn't one. It will only cause resentment in your relationship. If he hasn't given you a reason to think he's doing something inappropriate, he probably isn't."
"OMG this explains everything about my parents in law who have used threats, financial punishment, guilt tripping, insults etc to try to get us to let them have their grandchildren ALONE."
"You found a kindred spirit, but be careful about falling into using each other as therapists for the past. Instead, move the conversation into getting to know each other"
"I did this when I was 17 and he was 29. Got addicted to heroin because I was “in love” and he said it was the best feeling in the world. It was. 6 rehabs and 3 jail stays later I’m sober. I almost died a lot of times. It happened so fast. It’s very hard not to try it when there’s other people around you doing it. It was the first person that I felt like loved me because I was depressed. This could end badly. You could talk to her but nothing anyone says can really change her mind. 
It’s up to her to realize this. You can try and guide her but ultimately it’s her decision."
"If my husband put a tracker on my car for that reason, he'd tell me about it."
He is not ready for an adult relationship with a real person...
"Try a game store where people go to play D&amp;D or tabletop games! A lot of places allow people to drop in and join games, and there's usually a cork board somewhere with flyers of people asking for others to join their regular games."
"Lol seriously. She should tell him she’s gonna keep tinder installed to see if she ever comes across his profile and judge his reaction. Or they can just break up, ya know, whatever works."
"Anna is making the classic mistake of trying to answer and mitigate her husbands behavior. Which is not her job. 

“Anna, I was offended by John’s response to X (use an example the affected you directly)

It really doesn’t matter what he meant seriously or not. What matters is that people felt offended by what he said and responded accordingly. It’s the same as someone who says something mean and that defends their behavior with “it was a joke”—it’s a not a joke of only the joker finds it funny. 

“Anna, I am not in charge of whether other people take your husband too seriously or not. They are offended and do not want to socialize with him. If you want to press the issue, i recommend taking it up with them.”

You are merely organizing events for the group. You are not their elected representative. The whole speaking for other people thing needs to stop."
There's a word for that: mental charge. When men think we have to remind them everything and we have to think about the tasks for them. It's double work and so pressuring. It's not fair and household chores need to be equal.
Ditto - was going to recommend the dishes in the sink story. He needs to step up or step out. And you... drop the rope. Just stop doing it all.
"Have they regretted their behavior towards you? Do they still feel that way about LGBT people? Have they ever tried to apologize for being horrific human beings?

If the answer to the above questions are no you have no reason to feel guilty and you need to tell your sister that you will not allow your children to be exposed to hateful abusive people who would cause the childrens Mothers harm."
"Being together in the same house is definitely NOT quality time together. People can grow apart if that's what happens. It's different for every couple. My husband and I do a lot of things in the same room, but separately. He likes when I hang out with him in the living room while he games or whatever and I'm on my phone or looking at stuff online. We're both pretty low key and chill. We go out with friends rarely, but we have two kids so a lot of our free time is spent with them. We go and do things just the two of us but not as much as we used to and that's OK. For now, that's how life is. We talk to each other and spend quality time in the ""in-between moments"". But sometimes it can feel like there's a bit of distance there.

The important thing is there is no rule book on how things SHOULD be. How do you want them to be?"
So your boyfriend is incredibly selfish.... have you talked to him about this or no?
"That's exactly what I was going to say. If nothing actually happened with the new girl but she said something did, I'd take that shit to HR so fast if I were her boyfriend. You don't just go around purposefully lying about something as serious as sex at work. She's destroying his reputation."
"Thank you, I’ll see if there’s a fee for breaking the lease. I appreciate your feedback &lt;3"
"Yep, that's true. And another reason that it's almost certainly her husband that put it there. It definitely doesn't sound like it was wired in, so it would need to be recharged/have the batteries changed every once in a while.

And yeah, it may need data pulled off, but there are trackers that can store the data, and then he could have it uploaded via wifi when it's in the garage. My guess is that he's doing it that way. I'm fairly sure that trackers with real time tracking pretty much always require a subscription, so he would need to pay either monthly or yearly, which would run the risk of OP seeing - unless he has a secret credit card or something. But he would definitely need to recharge it every once in a while by hand."
You get to goof off with your friends basically every day- does your wife get to do the same?
My husband and I are struggling with this now. In the hospital he literally just played on his tablet. It was bad enough a NURSE  screamed at him. It took his mother telling him is was considering divorce for him to just start to help out. And dude I don't blame her if she left. You are a shit husband and shit father.
"&gt; waiting before feeding and letting a child get completely worked up isn't actually beneficial for the whole process.

OMG YES. My wife had a really hard time breastfeeding at first, and we ended up seeing a lactation consultant several times, and one of the things she suggested was getting the baby on the boob ASAP, as the more frustrated the baby is, that harder it is for them to latch, and then that disrupts the whole feeding process as the baby just gets more and more worked up."
"A guy who says 'why didn't you warn me I was running out of clothes' is not someone you can get through to, imo. OP needs to look long and hard at why she is accepting this behaviour. I get a very strong sense of learned helplessness from this post ('how do I make him see? why does he do this? how do I communicate better?') but I suspect OP cannot make him see. He knows what the hell he's doing--he's a grown-ass adult. He's purposefully making her into the bad guy at every turn to make himself feel better. This is not a guy who's a well-meaning manchild and can be therapised into adulthood.

OP, when are you gonna decide that enough is enough? Stop trying to be gentle and nice. Get angry. This treatment is bullshit. Stand up for yourself and what you deserve!"
I agree completely. That's why I mentioned that OP has left something out. There is more to this.
"This is on you, OP. You're acting like a reed in the wind, the poor goof stuck in the middle of two demanding parties. You're not. You've engineered this situation, whether you realize it or not. When you get married, it's your job to deal with your family. If you fail to set boundaries with your parents, who still expect you to do what they ask and have spare time like when you were a kid, that's shitty. If you make your wife out to be the conflicting party, that's extra shitty. You're forcing your wife to take on the role of defending the needs of the household. Don't do that. You should care about your own pets. You should care about your wife's desires and emotional state. You should care about the impacts of this and the precedent you're setting by letting them make demands of you last minute, and caving to them. You should be the one navigating this river, trying to figure out if you can bring the pets to your place and make it work for a few days, or just stop by, or even bring the wife and pets to theirs if that's necessary, among many options. I suspect that this is just something you like to do, and you want to have an excuse to do it, and playing the ""poor sap in the middle"" is your way of deflecting all responsibility so that you don't have to consider all of the negative impacts your wife and household have to endure. It's a bad look, it's weak at best, and manipulative. Own your desires and your role in your life."
"Dude, this is just a strip of synthetic fake lashes lol. That sounds like a super extreme reaction that's way overboard..."
"My sister dealt with this. Her husband's sister in law was getting married at an all inclusive resort in Cancun. A. You can't even legally get married there so it was dumb. B. The cost for the 3 day weekend was like $1800 per person (Including flights) C. If you look online, the resort has wedding packages where if 10 guest rooms are booked for your wedding, the bride &amp; groom stay free, and the wedding is basically free. I'm guessing you're footing the bill for their wedding."
"When someone’s words and actions disagree, their actions are the answer."
Aren’t IUD pregnancies usually in the wrong place and therefore dangerous and not viable? Have you had a full ultra sound and made sure everything is on the up and up? Hey I’m pregnant and need an emergency procedure because this type of pregnancy is fatal vs hey do we need to take pregnancy options etc. are two very different conversations to have.
"-Been together over a year

-30 yo

-Refuses to let you come over

-Insists on going to yours, even if it risks losing your housing and upsetting your family

-Ghosts you while texting unless you talk dirty

-Refuses to live together before marriage

This guy is a fucking mess. Why stay?"
It is not common to be condescending and demeaning to your in-laws. Not everyone can pay several thousand dollars for a destination wedding.
"Soo your girlfriend's mother bought an apartment with the intention of having the both of you move in but neither her nor your gf properly discussed this with you? Bad start. If her mom's the landlord I don't think you should move in at all under any circumstance, whatever the rent or location of the place. There's a risk of it ending up a breeding ground for trouble. As a couple you should stay independent from parents and family unless you have no choice."
"I've seen in a couple of your replies that you're worried that when you try to set boundaries, he'll argue that you've behaved just as badly as him. It might be helpful for you to reframe your thinking here – this isn't a debate you're having with your friend, where he can ""win"" by guilting you to stop you from ""abandoning"" him. This conversation is about you deciding to change, and having the integrity to tell him and not just ghost him. And maybe he'll surprise you – wouldn't it be nice if he was supportive of you wanting better for yourself? Isn't that what you would want from a best friend?"
"Keppra is really bad. 


GBM is a terrible disease with a bad prognosis, and many patients lose themselves in the ongoing treatments. It’s hard on patients and families alike. 


OP, it’s worth talking to your BF and seeing if the hospital where he’s receiving treatment has a social worker. They can help you find resources to better handle some of what’s going on; does your boyfriend have a caretaker of any kind?"
"This one is difficult.

Also I am super sex positive and my wife had more partners than me by a lot. But If my wife did porn in college and didn’t tell me? Then I found out on a random porn site? I would seriously have to think about the relationship.

That’s like tsomething you tell them a few months in. A simple “oh I was in a random college girls gone crazy porn” and at that point they prolly don’t care. But after 5+ years it just comes off different, like you just now say this after everybody is invested in the relationship.

Chances are he never finds it. So not telling him is an option too. if you never told him and he never found out then I think that is the best scenario of all. But again the longer it goes the more pissed odd I would be. 

Dunno how your guy is. So he may not care. But I would care and it would be a major thing on my mind for a while."
"Wow, in which country do you get 8 weeks a year holiday (that isn't teaching)?

I think this is unreasonable. Yeah, sure, you could do a little bit more than half considering you have time off and are around (if you are indeed around--if you are away for a few days, clearly you can't do her dishes then, right?), but her demanding you do all her chores is simply ridiculous.

You should however, contribute equally to the groceries and bills etc during your stay. I say paying 'rent' is too much considering you have your own place and it's temporary, but it's only fair to pay half of the water/gas/electric/internet bill for the weeks you are there, and half of the food."
"I think it’s worth saying something.

“I notice we do birthday dinners for others. Do they organize their own dinners? Should I be doing that too?” Is the subtle, non-blame approach. The wtf approach is, however, warranted."
"Your wife doesn’t get to claim she’s a “modern woman” when she doesn’t work full time and contribute 2 incomes to the household. It’s not even being sexist, it’s just pulling your weight in a partnership. Your wife is being an entitled brat. You need to divide chores by free time, so calculate your commute, work, and sleep hours. Hobbies don’t count. And then divide chores according to free time. Maybe that will convince your wife to hire a cleaning service since she doesn’t want to do the majority of the housework."
"Omg THIS OP, THIS!! My boyfriend and I are in a similar situation, he has extremely overbearing parents who feel like they can make demands on his time and say jump and he will ask how high. It has taken us almost 4 years for him to realize that parent child relationships evolve and this is not healthy. 

I am going to guess from your responses that there are a lot of underlying issues that Alice has with your parents- I would direct you over to r/JUSTNOMIL as those good people may be able to help you get to the bottom of your problem. 

My boyfriend didn't realize that just because his parents asked him to do something, does not necessarily mean that he automatically has to do it **if he doesn't want to** (I would wager your particular issue here is that you don't know what you want or you do and are too afraid to put it out there). 

He felt like he had to because if/when he says no, they guilt and manipulate him. I got a little bit of that from your parents asking you ""why not?"" when you do say no- that is what changes it from a simple request between family members, to an expectation from a controlling parent. Do you see the difference now? 

And every time his parents want him to do something, he comes to me and says ""are we busy this day...?"" and I say ""don't think we have any plans"" then he drops the ""my parents want to me x,y,z"". Which enrages me for two reasons: 1. that statement does not tell me what he (my boyfriend) wants and 2. it conveys that he has already agreed to said request and I have no choice but to grin and bear it. Do you see why that would be frustrating to your wife? 

Hopefully this sheds some light for you OP, good luck!"
"Yes, perspective is a lot, especially when it comes to money. The clothes for our groomsmen in my wedding this year were, in our opinion, very inexpensive, and yet we still had 2 groomsmen who couldn’t afford them and we ended up covering it for them."
"Have you tried flipping that schedule around a little? Like stopping by your parents house in the morning and for an hour or so at night to take care of the pets, but sleeping at home? Needing to help with the animals is one thing. But what are you accomplishing by sleeping at the house? You’re not spending time with the pets when you’re asleep, and the house isn’t going to run away."
"Because the dog needs some social aspects and its probably piece of mind for OP and the parents more than anything. 

I feel I'm in the minority in this thread I have no idea why the wife is so up and arms about this issue. They live close, he still spends time at home on these days, its only a few times a year and he is helping his childhood pets. I wouldn't have an issue, she does and to each their own but don't know a good compromise when OP wants to help his childhood pets."
"Yeah. I’m a bridesmaid for my cousin’s wedding, and I’m paying $180 for my makeup. I live in Los Angeles, so that’s pretty cheap. The only reason I’m not paying more is because my friend (who is a pro makeup artist) is giving me a discount. 

That shit is expensive."
"knowing him i would not be surprised if he literally stalked me around my local (community hub pub thing) causing aggro, even though i know everyone there would have my back, the tenner is not worth risking giving him something to agg over. also medical care is free here (uk) so do not need to worry about money there even if knee needs attention. thanks for your reply"
"At 29 you must speak to them because if you don't they assume you don't actually mind and will have no motivation to change. There are two results: they realize they fucked up and change because they care OR they will show they don't care and at least you will know exactly how they view the relationship. 

Either way, your path forward will be clear and you won't be in this emotionally confusing place anymore."
Have you ever MET a 13 year old? That sounds exactly like how they behave.
All the comments about keyloggers make this sound risky.
Reverse the situation. Would you want to know?
This is what I was thinking as well. If I were OP I’d look for a hotel on my own then let the groom know that you had to do so because you couldn’t afford the current option if this is argued against then most something is fishy.
"I think sometimes people can improve and reconciliation can be a possibility. However, I read this part:

&gt;Predictably my social media and phone have been blowing up with my parents and relatives who think they have a right to my life and my daughter (and child or children I'm pregnant with) after they disowned me for pursuing a life of my own, being gay, and converting to another religion. They've really focused on my daughter especially, I'm apparently the first of my parents' children to have kids and my parents have gone nuts with OUR GRANDDAUGHTER. 

And I didn't see anything about your parents (and other estranged family members) apologizing and trying to make things right. Now, maybe you've just left that part out, but I doubt it. Your account suggests everything they've tried to communicate to you was about themselves and their perceived right to have a relationship with your grand-daughter. If they haven't really changed their positions, don't think they've done anything wrong, and still believe you a horrible person who has shamed the family, how would a relationship with your daughter even work?

&gt;like to meet my wife and her niece without hiding it from the family

I'm sympathetic. She shouldn't have to lie or keep secrets. However, maybe a compromise would be for her to openly keep things from them? That is, meet up with you guys, not lie about it or keep it a secret, but also refuse to provide certain information (addresses, etc.)"
"No that’s not normal or fair. Think long and hard about this; does this disregard for you and treating fairly manifest in other parts of you relationship? If so, consider couples therapy do deal with the issue or cut your losses."
"That is a really great way of putting it. There is so much pressure not to come out with things like that because you'll ""ruin their life"" with little to no regard for your own safety. Back in highschool my SO said something similar to what you did here because I was afraid and felt SO guilty for coming forward about this guy who had been...shall we say verbally and physically insistent on being with me and was following me everywhere and threatening my other friends. My SO's support and continued assurances that I was not ruining anything, that the guy ruined everything all on his own and that I needed to protect myself and those I care about is the only reason that I managed to go to the authorities. 







OP, please take this to heart. He is HEAVILY invading both your, and those around you's privacy and threatening your safety. Take whatever measures you have to to protect yourself. Whatever consequences come his way are his own doing."
"""the condo she shares with her uncle""

Let me just leave this here."
"I mean it’s not like smoking pot alone is a big deal, let’s not get all war on drugs fuckin crazy here, the problem is that he does it in their house if they don’t permit that and steals medication"
"&gt; My mom was apparently visiting my sister and grabbed the phone away from her. She started screaming at me about how could I have a daughter, why did I not tell her I was getting married, how could I steal her grandchildren from her, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eventually I snapped, told her **""I have a daughter, you do not have a granddaughter"" and hung up.** 

Fucking high five right there.

&gt;Problem is, my sister thinks I'm being mean. She'd like to meet my wife and her niece without hiding it from the family, and thinks I can meet my family somewhere in the middle.  
&gt;  
&gt;My gut feeling says no, my family burned their bridges years ago and I don't want my daughter exposed to people who think I'm sick, shameful, and sinful for living my life the way I've chosen. My wife agrees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, from someone who's not intimately tied up in this mess, am I being unfair to my parents? Should I hear them out? Or should I just keep stonewalling them?

As an outsider here, I'd say you're not unfair. I agree with your gut feeling and your wife. You do not want your daughter to be exposed to your parents. Your parents have no interest in reconciling with you, they'd try to screw you over in claiming your daughter.

Stonewall them. They burned their bridges.

Also, I hope your sister will be alright amidst this."
"The thing with heat is that you can only make yourself so comfortable before you're essentially naked. In colder conditions you at least have the option to bundle up some more. IMO if the only reason you don't want to wear some extra layer is because ""it's summer!"" you don't really have a good excuse- especially if its *his* apartment. idk maybe look into having the temp between 72-73?"
"Agreed. Honestly there are too many crazy stories of abusive parents trying to use the legal system to get rights over their grandkids as a method of controlling or punishing their kids. OP, trust your gut. Your parents had years to reach out. They could have written a nice email or letter, but instead they are demanding control over your life again even after you did something incredibly nice"
"&gt;She's not very capable of staying safe on her own

Then she needs a babysitter. Your boyfriend is using you as free childcare, that he probably knows he needs, without compensating you or apparently ever asking."
"Yeahhhh reading the OPs comments, I am suspicious.  Sounds like he's being deliberately vague - wouldn't be surprised if ""a couple times a year"" is actually like 5 or 6, and maybe he has a track record of putting his parents' needs over his wife's.  It is certainly possible she is being unreasonable, but my guess is she's got some legitimate complaints, and what OP is actually asking is ""how can I prioritize being at my parents' beck and call without my wife getting mad at me?"""
"As a pet sitter, this is hilarious only because of its ignorance - many elderly pets (especially ones that are going BLIND) have intense anxiety when staying away from home which can be damaging to their health as they may not eat as a result, which again, is horrible for elderly pets. And as OP stated, he isn’t there “24/7”, just to take care of them when needed and stays in the evenings. Many pets need stability with some sense of routine/comfort, such as staying in their own environment, and as a rule for general house sitting as well, having someone in your house overnight brings a large sense of security. Personally I see no logical reason why the wife is upset about this. Maybe a solution would be to ask his parents for a payment."
"Well, you aren't going to like any of the responses you get, but the only thing you can do is give him a series of ultimatums and then stick with them.  And if he breaks them, kick him out.  You don't want to hear that though, because if you had the kind of stick-to-it-ness that this strategy required, I'd imagine you'd have done it by now.  

But it goes like this. Son you have 60 days to find a job, or you find a new place to live.  30 days after that you start paying me X amount of dollars for rent or you find a new place to live.  If you need therapy, I'll help you get it, but what you aren't going to do is rot your life away on my sofa any more. 

He's not going to move unless you kick him. So kick him or get used to walking around him."
Then gate the stairway and keep the dog downstairs.
You never should have moved back. Your mom is not going to pay for your college.
"Please listen to this advice, OP. The cops are usually used against the victim and help the abusers (intentionally or not). Please don't call the cops unless J wants them called."
It's exactly as your\_internet\_friend has explained -- the inconsistency of shift work
This is absolutely abuse. Consider calling CPS yourself or talking to a school counselor of some form. They’re mandated reporters and can help you through the process.
"I'm so very sorry.  A lot of times with a sudden loss like that, a person can actually suffer from PTSD. 

What she really needs right now is a good grief counselor and/or therapist.   You can't always save the people you love, but talking to her without judgment of how she is coping could help.  

If there are self defense classes or weight lifting or any kind of physical skill or course she wants to try, that's where I would start.  Maybe you could ask her girlfriends to go and invite her along.  It would be great if she could find something else to focus her energy on (and feel she has some control) for a release."
