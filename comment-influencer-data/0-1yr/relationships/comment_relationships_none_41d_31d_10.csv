"Op it doesn't matter why you gained weight. It doesn't even matter that you gained it. bodies do what bodies will do. 

You literally made a human with your body. I'm assuming your husband wanted said human. Now he's upset about the consequences. 

Your husband seems to live in a fairy tale land where women must look as the unattainable standard of beauty and torment themselves to get there if needed. 

It's cruel and unacceptable."
Honey throw the whole man out the plane without a parachute
"Wow, I am in the same situation as you now! So happy for you!!"
"I am so sorry for you, I have lived a long time and know how precious life is.  So I will get to the point...you need to run fast as you can from him. What you have is not a relationship..you know it. You can‚Äôt fix him and it isn‚Äôt fixable."
"I‚Äôm super stoked for you! I just read both posts and I can tell by the way you talk that you sound happier. I‚Äôm currently in the same shoes, with someone where it‚Äôs so easy, and relaxed that it makes my anxiety go nuts lol. But you learn to grow, and after a year with my man I have grown from the trauma. And it looks as though you have grown into a wonderful partner. Happy anniversary!"
"Just tell her. There are things that you can remember fondly, and talk to your friends about, but it doesn‚Äôt make it something your partner wants to hear. 

I wouldn‚Äôt want to hear it, either."
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky he was drunk most of my pregnancy because he wouldn‚Äôt have stuck around if he noticed I had gained so much weight‚Äù

OH MY GOD. if some scum of the earth ever found the balls to say something like this to me after carrying the result of his sperm for 9 months not only would I take the baby and run and divorce his ass but I would go full scorched earth and tell every single person that this is the way he treats the mother of his child. I would literally tell everybody what he said to me so everyone could know. Please OP have the respect for yourself and your child because existing in a world without this fucker in it might seem difficult or lonely but it sure as hell isn‚Äôt the torture and suffering of what it sounds like you‚Äôre currently going through."
"He sounds like he wants to indirectly force you into wanting to be a certain weight and using skydiving as a cover, also he sounds insensitive. I would be hurt"
"So you're telling me that your husband doesn't do things to make you feel loved that he maybe wouldn't have done before you were in a committed relationship? Because if you are I'd call that bullshit.  
I'm not saying he should pretend! He can empathize with her can't he? He can understand why she would be upset? That's not pretending! That's being loving human being."

"She totaled your Grand National.  I wouldn't let he borrow my skateboard after that. I think the other people that are mad at you should let her borrow one of their cars. You owe her nothing.  I don't suppose she has offered to get you another Grand National, has she?"
"Honestly it sounds like the relationship might just have run its course. You guys got together at 16, people change in that time. Being long distance for 4 years, barely speaking to each other, it doesn't sound like either of you are getting much out of this. Maybe it's time for both of you to move on?"
"I'm currently going through this whole issue myself and reading both of your posts and the comments has helped me see things differently. I've spent the last three weeks trying to decipher if I really have romantic feelings for this man or just seek his friendship. I've been waiting for the spark I usually chase after which has always ended horribly. 

Thank you for sharing, you're helping so many other women and men in your position. Congrats girl!"
"Be careful of love bombing, it can be a sign of some bad mental habits."
"And you don't think I am, that's funny. Great to know that just because you may be older than me you don't treat adults with the same respect you treat yourself üëç"
"Did I misinterpret ""BMI matters""?"
He's going to do it again because he doesn't think he really did anything wrong.
"Of course not, I didn‚Äôt imply that they could. OP said they decided to try again."
"""BF, I AM RIGHT HERE"" People look at other people, it's fine, but there's not need to be rude about it, and turning your head is rude. I have male friends who don't do this when I am with them, even though we are not sexually involved and it wouldn't matter to me. Your bf doesn't have to look at every woman who passes by him, he has plenty of time to do that when he's alone."
"There is no reason to bring personal issues into this at all. Simply, her behavior is making it impossible for you to do your job and is therefore hurting the company as a whole. *That* is the issue. No more need be said. Just provide evidence. Period. Let HR do their jobs. Do Not Mention the Incident in any form either to them or to her."
I wish my man would lmao
The guy I'm with now this is how our first date was. I ghosted him and we ended up back together and I love him so much. I do believe it can happen. Good luck
"Dude, I am a white African, and one that has hundreds of years of family history in Africa. NONE OF THE WHITE AFRICANS I KNOW WOULD EVER REFER TO THEMSELVES AS 'AFRICAN-AMERICAN', or even African, mostly. Say you are Zambian-American if you want. But stop being obtuse. You are wrong. Take a look at yourself, try to spend some time understanding James, and stop being an asshole.

You will cringe at your behaviour in a few years. I hope."
"You should not explain your insecurities to her. She has no business knowing any of that and you can be friends without it. 

The only person you should be talking about your insecurities regarding this friendship with is your boyfriend. 

Think about it; if she really *does* have any sort of intentions towards your boyfriend, you'd just be giving her a bunch of ammunition to use to break you guys up for good. 

And if she doesn't, you're just dumping a lot of baggage onto a girl who doesn't deserve it. 

Work through your insecurities with your BF, not with his friend who you've never met before."

"Does it really matter what he thinks? What do you think? 

He admitted to sexually assaulting someone and to having thoughts of taking it further until his victim puked on him. 

Instead of showing any kind of seIf-awareness or moral character, he decides to redefine what it means to be a sexual predator and a cheater and expects you to accept this new altered reality. 

What do you think about his behaviors? What are your thoughts on being safe with someone who thinks like this?"
"Weekend trips, camping in the car, or staying at a cheap motel will spice things up. 

A day trip just to have breakfast at a remote dinner somewhere. Life can be awesome, if you let it!"
"I mean, she can say that, but how does he ""show a little more sympathy""? Can she define what she means by that? Is there a set of rules for how to express his own personal opinion in a way that will be more acceptable to her?

The problem with being someone who doesn't express themselves clearly is that you *are going to be misunderstood*. The problem with being someone who *does* is that apparently people get mad that you don't perform an emotion you're not feeling just because it would ""make them feel better about it"" if you pretended. That's the *opposite* of communication--it's obfuscation."
"Run, don‚Äôt walk, away from this ass!"
"Grandparents, in the process of losing the one I‚Äôm closest to now, couple friends, and an uncle."
"Disclaimer: I'm a liberal/progressive white guy, my wife is from the middle east, so take this as you will.

I think the thing to focus on is how they treat you. If the things they say and do seems to point toward you being a novelty prop, then you're probably right, they care more about your identity they care about you as a person. If they respect you, the whole you as a person, and aside from just being curious about you and your lived experiences they don't do or say anything that makes you feel like a prop, then they probably aren't just with you for the novelty factor. Obviously, the people you date (white guys or not) are going to be attracted to you, and you can't really detach your identity from that, you just have to focus on how they treat you."

"Enjoy the time. But don‚Äôt get fatigued. Spending a lot of time together is important to beginning a relationship, but you don‚Äôt want to become so dependent so quickly. My SO and I started out like you guys did and we‚Äôre coming up on 1 year. Good luck OP!"
"She's literally upset that he didn't hesitate before saying he doesn't want a child with her.

They've known each other for a month. Of course he doesn't want a child with her! What was he supposed to say?"
Thanks for your reply. The thing is: I am not sure I want to know this child and I can‚Äôt trust my father on coming clean about the situation. And J am afraid they (him and my aunt) will try and make me feel guilty for asking him to come clean - and he will never do on the pretext of not wanting to hurt my brother. But I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my place to tell my stepmom (and my therapist is on maternity leave so I can‚Äôt ask her neither!)

"Relationships do weird things to people, and it sounds to me like she is very emotionally dependent on him. It also sounds like he was a loser and there‚Äôs probably a piece of her that thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way he‚Äôll ever break up with me, he‚Äôs the unemployed goal-less guy and I‚Äôm a catch‚Äù. I‚Äôd be upfront about the part that she deserves better, and upfront about not stooping to his level. Being upset makes people make rash decisions - telling her that she may regret some of the choices she‚Äôs making is a smart idea. After touching on how she‚Äôs feeling, giving her a little advice and support, I would leave it alone and see what happens."
"Hey, good luck! It is great that your boss is so supportive, but remember, this is also because you were a great employee before all this trouble.

I've seen a colleague at work who was devastated by her divorce, got very thin because she couldn't even eat anymore. Boss gave her time and space to heal, allowed her to come to work just to talk with her teammates. Now, half a year later, she's an excellent employee again and on top of her game again."

"Yeah, that seems like a good way of approaching it. Thanks."
I'll be blunt. I think you're being an idiot. He already cheated on you and you stayed with him? How will you ever have trust again? Now he wants to talk to the girl he put his dick in while he was with you? What do you think is going to happen. Please find some self-respect and leave this guy. There are plenty of other people out there.

"Honestly? I feel pretty guilty and ashamed about making such a careless mistake (not seeing that my check hadn't gone through yet). Asking someone to lend me money for something that isn't necessary would only make those feelings worse. 

But shouts out to my friends and family that would lend me $50 in a heartbeat just so I could mash mouths with a cutie. ·Éö(¬¥‚óâ‚ù•‚óâÔΩÄ·Éö)"
Let them be mad and make sure your keys are safe from your aunt.
If you think you could be serious about this guy the difference between you will matter less and less as time goes on. Are you in different stages of life? If he is in college and you‚Äôre starting your career this could be a challenge but age is just a number.They say guys mature more slowly than girls but this is general. You should make an individual assessment about this guy and your compatibility. You said yourself you weren‚Äôt going to listen to your sister anymore. Take the advice as proceed with caution but make your own decision.
"I‚Äôm shocked she has the nerve to ask you? Did she forget what she did last time? 

Did she apologize and pay you what your car was worth? 

Mind boggling."
"That particular brand of Woke White Dude definitely exists, and they are exhausting."
"I almost hate to say it, but he's cheating."
You guys are in your early 30's what kind of highschool relationship drama is this? You should've left 2 years ago
Thanks guys for your thoughts.
"Why are you even playing these games? You can ask questions all you want and evaluate his answers all you want but at the end of the day, when these types of situations actually hit home you both might very well have a different opinion. You testing him like this isn‚Äôt preparing yourselves for anything it‚Äôs just immature."
Lol no not at all! It was just that he said it quite blunt while I was hoping for a bit more reassurance
Misinformed? You definitely need to own up to it more.
"Sounds like he‚Äôs doing it for you, actually!"
"And this is why you don't dip your pen in the company inkwell....

If she wants to keep it all business, then treat her like any other colleague and escalate it. Tell her this is business, not personal. CYA"
Just call yourself an American African
"Don‚Äôt waste your life with a man like that, my father leaving me and my mom and sister was the best thing that happened to us. You deserve better"
next time he does it say hey can you please be more aware of that? it makes me feel disrespected. if he argues or gets defensive fuckin dump him life is way too short.
Ngl I've totally thought about it but I'm not really sure how HR would handle it. She hasn't done anything that's crossed an obvious professional line she's just basically been an obnoxious PITA who's very difficult to work with. I'm kinda worried that talking to HR might just air out all the dirty laundry without solving anything.

"You need to communicate to him that this bothers you. While it's not in itself harmful if you're going crazy about it, then you need to say something."
"Oh, yes. I have always been taught that Matthew 5:38-42 was about a rejection of an eye for an eye, responding to unfairness, wrongness and cruelty with forgiveness and love as opposed to going on the defense ""38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."""

Congrats on getting into nursing. My wife in a ER nurse and it's an important line of work with a lot of potential. If you're getting in now, you're going to be rolling in dough by the time you're my age. Be smart with it. **Don't talk to your parents about your finances.**"

"I'm kind of confused, that seems like a relatively cost-effective date- are you worried about gas money? How far away is the location you want to ""scour"" lol?  Did he offer to drive or did you? Either way, it's not outside the realm of possibility to either change the date until after you get paid and in the meantime suggest something ultra cheap like coffee or something until you get paid again. If you're insistent on this date, maybe just ask him if he'd be up for driving."

This is textbook gaslighting. Your boyfriend is abusive.
"If it bothers you so much, you need to communicate it to her. Just floundering around and letting it all eat you alive is not constructive."
"Nah dude, she's fucking nuts. Lay that pipe a few more times then call it a day."
"This is so sweet, congrats on your marriage!"
"Depends. Right now if you like spending time with her, best is to be observant of her personality. Too early to jump to conclusions."
Thatswhat I meant just communication. We are on even opinions on the subject but him saying it would be a hard decision or if want to sit down then and have a good talk would have given me more than a yeah I'd go for abortion. I'm not saying he's wrong but the way how could have been a bit more caring and deeper on the matter it's not just a practical but also an emotional decision
That's a fantastic idea!!
Congratulations on your soon-to-be marriage!
"My comment isn‚Äôt in regards to who is right or wrong, but this is obviously tearing you up. I think you‚Äôre incompatible, there are plenty of people out there who don‚Äôt maintain relationships with ex wives."

"Stop posting this.

Stop dating this obviously awful user. 

Stop expecting a different answer."
I meant make him aware of the issue with her behavior not the issue with us sleeping together. The last thing I want is for that to get out. Basically I'm just gonna cc him on some of our work related emails where she's being obstructive like some other commenters were suggesting.
Are you expecting the responses to change? He has a history of using girlfriends for money and it‚Äôs very likely he jumped into a relationship with you so soon to do the same. Either accept it or leave him.
"In the words of Nsync, BYE, BYE, BYE!"
He sounds like such a LOSER!
"Retain that boundary. For good reason.

In the UK you can't just drive any car, only the one you own and/or are on the insurance for, which I usually think is pretty annoying but in cases like this is actually a good thing. If your parents think she should have access to someone else's car so bad they should give access to theirs and let her total theirs. You don't owe anyone access to your car. (Did she give you any payment after totalling the last one?!)"
"Tell her every time she brings one up, you get the opportunity to try it."
"I sure in hell would not allow her to use the car. She destroyed your last one which you paid for. She is out of her damn mind to be asking to use your car. Make sure to keep the keys on you at all times so no one else lets her use it/gives her the keys. It is also really suspicious she won't just let someone drive her, what is she wanting to do where no one can come alone?"
"Doesn't sound like an eating disorder, just a bad diet. A housemate of mine used to eat chicken fingers all day long. The laxatives are odd though. Sounds more like insecurity over body image. Being surrounded by people with eating disorders has probably skewed her sense of what is healthy."
"Sorry for the delay in this reply - I still recommend that he explores this issue with a therapist as his first line of approach, who will be way more helpful in either evaluating the potential causes *or* teaching him strategies to handle this type of conflict.

This is almost always a bad idea and I would be hesitant to recommend it in many other situations, but given the particular context of your relationship, have you ever tried having these conversations over texting? This carries all kinds of its own problems with potential misinterpretations of tone or the absence of body language cues, but if he can at least get words out via this method it might be an interim step while he learns how to address conversations?"
"Would you be upset if he was doing the same exact activities with a male coworker? If he was going to cheat on you, he could do so without sharing a room. I agree it‚Äôs annoying he didn‚Äôt consult you beforehand, and you should be upfront with him about that, but if he hasn‚Äôt given you any reason not to trust him, it doesn‚Äôt sound like you need to worry."

"Girrrrlll...you're his fall back in case he doesn't find anything better. That's why he's doing that. It's a clear cut case. 

Stop talking to this dude and move on. You're better than that."
[removed]
You don't think both your parents being concerned about this isn't a red flag?
Your husband sounds like an asshole. Just wow... I would be tempted to get into the best shape of my life and immediately leave him. Spiteful I know. Was he this much of a jerk before you got married?
"That's true, I should learn the difference between an intolerance and an allergy first of all. 

I do plan to bring my father to my next appointment so I hope that goes well."
"I'd say if you need to keep a journal do it in a password protected online file instead, though I know for many the tactile act of writing things down physically is key - if so, carry it with you so she can't find it. Let them know this betrayal of trust makes it less likely for you to share things with them, not more. They still view you as a child that they have a right to know everything about. They do not. You may be able to build a more open relationship in the future but they have damaged that for now. Ask why they felt the need to snoop: had they tried just asking you how things were or are they closed off &amp; closed mouthed? Were they worried about a specific thing that made them feel this need to pry, or do they just have no respect for boundaries?"
"I think it's weird that people around you are advising you to ""stay friends with her and eventually you will be boyfriend/girlfriend"".  From what you're telling us here it seems they're just guessing and gambling with your emotions.

When you say ""our therapist"", I assume you and she have the same therapist, which means that she has a therapist.  She should deal with her issues there, and I think it's shitty of the therapist to try to offload the work of healing her onto you, another person who is also seeing them for the purposes of being helped, not being used as a tool.

If she was using you to heal I'd think that was shitty too, but it doesn't seem like she's the one telling you to be her friend to become her boyfriend so I can't really blame her.  If she just wants to be friends, that's fair enough.  That doesn't mean by any stretch of the imagination that you have to be willing to settle for being her friend, just as you can't force her to be more than friends with you, she can't force you to remain friends with her if that hurts you.

Overall the situation is a bit confusing to me so I find it hard to give specific advice, or to tell you if you were wrong or not.  I'd say that you were probably not wrong to ask her about it, your emotions are yours and you have every right to try to clarify where you stand in social relationships.  The other partner may not always like it, or give you the answer you like, but that's a different issue.

It seems like you're stuck in a fairly common situation, you want more out of a relationship than just friendship, but the other party is happy with the relationship as-is.  You're infatuated with her so you're attentive, a good listener, you're there for her, you're helpful, and she doesn't have to do a great deal to have that deal, she just has to be a decent friend and maybe give you a light flirt from time to time to fuel your infatuation.  If she's sneaky she may be doing it intentionally, or it may be completely accidental and she really just thinks you feel the same about her as she does you.  It doesn't really matter which one it is, you have to ask yourself the same questions in either case.  Have you made it clear to her what you're looking for?  If she is not interested, are you willing to put yourself through the misery of hanging around as ""a friend"" and hoping (most likely in vain) that she might change her mind?

In the case of the latter question, if she's not interested I think it would be best for you long-term to minimize contact with her, even as a friend, to allow the infatuation to pass and let you open yourself up to another person who might return your feelings in turn.  That's probably not really what you wanted to hear, in fact this comment probably didn't primarily address the issue you wanted addressed, but I hope it can be some help anyway."
"Eh. I think it would honestly be a little more in your favour to try to hang out with people your age or older. There's nothing wrong with hanging out with younger people, but you are going to feel old. You should want to learn from everyone around you, young and old."
"This is really tough and really scarey. Unfortunately, eating disorders are generally still so stigmatized in society that it can be challenging for somebody to feel comfortable reaching out for help. I would suggest talking to your sister in a supportive way rather than accusatory way, ie how are you feeling about your body and food? Rather than saying I know you‚Äôre not eating enough or something like that. Make sure you make it clear you‚Äôre happy to support her in whatever way she needs whether that‚Äôs taking her to therapy, helping her with meal planning, or whatever else she needs. You can‚Äôt force her to talk to you about it or take you up on offers for help, but you can choose your language and help your family choose better language surrounding their own bodies/food/diet so your sister can see healthy relationships to bodies and food in her environment. So for example instead of using fat as an insult or bad word, you and your family can talk about how much you appreciate your bodies and what they do for you, or you can describe foods as tasty etc rather than ‚Äúgood/healthy‚Äù or ‚Äúbad/unhealthy‚Äù which often triggers people with eating disorders to feel guilty for eating or wanting certain foods. These are just starting points but I wish you and your sister health and happiness in this journey"
Right...but  there‚Äôs no indication any of that has happened in this thread. So what does it have to do with anything? That‚Äôs very different than simply being attracted to Asian chicks.
"hello. i find this is a very good idea and i think i could make the card myself, she would love it. i do not communicate properly verbally, so i feel expressing my feelings on a letter would be a lot easier and better, thank you very much.

i know it will be a long process and i don't want to rush things nor do i expect her to suddenly be alright by tomorrow, but i just want to cheer her up a little, maybe get her to take a walk, watch some tv with me...  
yes, at this point i just let her vent and i listen. i do not know what to say at all, so i think it's best i keep quiet. she does seem to think i don't care at all when i do this though, and i can see why. i'm also worried her grief is all she talks about. i want to distract her a little from that too, make her talk about other stuff, but i can't get her to.

i see. i have never gone through such a process of grief and i don't understand it. whenever i've lost a loved one (a friend, an uncle years ago) i just got over it, quicker than anyone else. i will then give her time and space to express herself, i hope that helps. 

thank you a lot for your answer."
I dont mind getting him a gift at all but I think it's silly to get ne something and I wish he knew what he wanted.
"Caring and loving when I expressed my concerns. He gave me a call to reassure me that he has thought about it a lot,  named his reasoning and off if the time comes we have a situation like this he won't run away or anything."
Because change is scary and you're familiar. You should go No Contact and stop letting him use you as a crutch.
"&gt;My \[30f\] best friend \[30f\] just got her psych degree, and she is constantly ""diagnosing"" our friends or friends of friends.

Yeah, I shaved mine, actually. :)"
"What a qawinkadink. I was cheated on at age 21 as well. I had a lot of the same feelings and questions, too. How can someone do something so horrible that they *know* would break your heart into a million, but still look you in the eyes and assure you everything is okay? Sorry, this is about to be a long winded anecdote, but I just see so much of myself in your situation and I want you to know it gets better. But it does suck.

Lack of empathy on that level may be from their upbringing (my ex came from an abusive family), or maybe they're just a selfish ass. But one thing is usually consistent in cheating scenarios: The person is incredibly insecure and is seeking validation. That is why they need you *and* the other person. But no matter what the reasons, there is no excuse for treating another person that way.

How did I deal with it? Well, it crushed my ego to feel ""replaced"" by another girl and it just made me think it meant there was something wrong with me. He gaslighted me into thinking it was all my fault, and I believed him. I got back together with him, but I was never able to trust him, harbored resentment about what he did, and therefore was just miserable.

It took me maybe 3 months of not speaking to him and focusing on myself and doing things that made *me* happy before I really started to move on. It then took me a couple years after that for the bitterness to go away. Now I'm 30 years old and it's 9 years later. I honestly have to scrape my memory for his name sometimes because I've made so many other more memories, good and bad, since.

I think dating in our 20s is a lot of still figuring out what it means to be truly compatible with another person, what it means to be in a solid partnership, what mistakes are okay to forgive, what the red flags we should never ignore look like, and how to learn self respect. Fact of the matter is, someone who can cheat on you with no remorse is better left kicked to the curb. No contact. BOY BYE.

I still chalk being cheated on up to the **worst** I've ever felt emotionally. I mean, by far. However I learned so much from it, and it taught me so much about self respect. That's right: In spite of everything and how much it sucked, I'm actually glad it happened. I would never be who I am today if it hadn't. Our scars make us who we are.

So thanks, whatever your name was."
"He sounds like a total peach...and so do you. 

Wishing you both the best, it‚Äôs so nice to get updates like this!"
"Post an update later on this same throwaway so people know if you're getting the help you need.

If your father doesn't want to provide you food that doesn't harm you, the next choices are more severe such as child protective services.

And as others have said, It is abuse.what if you were mildly allergic to a food and your parent purposefully kept that food around and cooked with it and forced you to eat it"
"Because it is not 100% physical appearance but also the stereotypes and about Asians that factor into fetishizatiom . 

Have you never heard redheads described as 'fiery' or some equivalent? Imagine that, but annoyingly racist cause no girl wants to hear how her race is so demure and cute/knows how to treat a man/etc till you barf from gross guy overload. And people are way more open about then you would think."

"Wow, what a winner you have there. You can certainly drop some weight before your birthday... your husband."
"Mmmm that's manipulative and gross. Sounds like the trash took itself out, pal"
"Good luck man! It's going to suck for a while, but I promise it will eventually start to suck less."
"Don't date her, mostly because you won't treat her right if you're already planning how to change her."
"i don't think she'll ever fully recover from that, but i want her to recover as much as she can. she gets upset whenever i mention she should go to therapy, so i'm going to drop that for now. she thinks she's alright and it'll go away on its own, while also refusing to do anything by/for herself. i think it's a normal reaction, pisses me off a little i won't lie, but i don't blame her, i just try to get her to do things, i try not to push her, but i'm worried nonetheless. if i can just get her to take a 10 minute walk down the street i will throw a party, honestly.

i'm glad to hear i'm doing well. i'm worried i'm not doing enough, it seems like so. i will continue to support her no matter how much time it takes."
"Yeah, call CPS. If you talk to her mom, she may do something worse to the child as a punishment for seeking help."
"Yeah that‚Äôs a tough one. On one hand I‚Äôm almost 30, so I lost my give a fuck filter a long time ago so me now would just be mostly honest and just say I had a surprise expense that left me a little strapped for cash and that if he wants to reschedule we can. He may just offer to take care of gas anyway. Me at 23, I would just be nondescript and vague and say I won‚Äôt be able to get out of town for the day but would love to meet you for coffee."
"Girl... he literally told you he would have left you because of your ""fat pregnancy weight"" if he wasnt too drunk and stupid to notice.
He doesnt respect you... and I'm not so sure I believe the BMI bull to the extent he was claiming.
You need serious couple counseling or a whole new partner all together, I vote the latter."
"You are mature for your age, yet are choosing to date women who are immature. Find a place where you can meet people who share common interests."
Very well said! You are absolutely correct! They do view us as property. And that way of thinking also attributes to the rape culture as well. If we can‚Äôt get it then we‚Äôll take it.

"She's confused because at the start of the relationship she outlined what she was looking for and specifically stated she did not want temporary relationships and he was all like yeah yeah sure baby.

Men lie. They lie and tell you what you want to hear at the start of relationships because they're not thinking with their big head. Many of them probably even believe their own lies in the heat of a new relationship and when things like marriage and kids are in the distant future.

That's why she's confused. She's young, she had properly vetted him and now he is singing a very different tune. Understandable because he is also young, though his supercilious tone is not acceptable. It takes a while to adjust to the fact that someone you loved and trusted is liar."
"Oh man.  I've been wanting to post something similar for about a month.  I've been in the most toxic of toxic relationships.  It took me about a year to adjust to the amount of genuine love, trust and respect my current boyfriend showers me with. It's crazy how much dating a real man can change your view of yourself and what you deserve.  

Congratulations girl!  I'm very happy you have found yourself a genuine man.  Good luck to you both ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"When you talk about your concerns, whether you're talking to your parents or your sister, keep the topic strictly on your concern for her health. Don't mention her weight - either in a positive or negative way - just say that you are worried about her health due to some of the eating habits you have noticed. Ask her if she has any concerns or issues other than food, as her eating habits might be a response to some external stress. Encourage her to do most of the talking, as she might actually clarify some of her unhealthy thinking patterns just by talking it through. 

It could help if you could gather some information (such as brochures, online sources) to show her some of the signs of an ED, and some of the resources available to her if she needs help. Encourage her to see a doctor, and offer to go with her, so she can be carefully monitored and perhaps receive counselling if it is necessary.

Your goal here is to help her acknowledge and address the problem, and to help her build up a support team, including friends, family, medical and psychological support. Your role is to be as non-judgemental and supportive as possible, so that she doesn't feel the need to be defensive or secretive.

If your parents are encouraging her to think that thin is ""good"", you need to talk to them first and explain why you are concerned. Keep all conversations away from food-related activities - eg, don't bring this up at the dinner table or take her to a cafe to talk."
"&gt;although she would not say when she had ""quit"" working.

Why do you think this is?"
I try to be open minded but I'm starting to believe there can NEVER be a healthy relationship with this kind of life-experience gap. There's always either a power imbalance or one/both people have severe emotional issues. The younger person having had to mature unnaturally fast and/or the older person not having matured enough.
"Like 30th time you‚Äôve rephrased the headline and reposted now. You have a problem and must seek help. Your problem isn‚Äôt your boyfriend, it‚Äôs your compulsive need to be on reddit asking for help on this precise situation."
And you have 5 karma. So why should anyone care what you have to say anyway? People like you are why I don't ask anybody for help.
You‚Äôre taking all of this extremely personally when it absolutely isn‚Äôt. Have a nice day.
Thank you for the much needed feedback... I feel like I'm going crazy but it's nice to hear from other people their thoughts on the situation. I'm certainly not perfect but I think there's a lot of things I have to learn still so thanks for providing me with some insight in regards to this
"Your TLDR is 100% correct. This man is not ready for a relationship with you. I don‚Äôt think you should attempt to take this relationship further. Find someone that‚Äôs ready for a relationship, meaning they aren‚Äôt romantically, financially or emotionally tied to another person."
"Explain to me how a larger bmi will NOT have an issue fitting into a safety harness? The harness that fits the 6ft 250lbs person will not fit someone 5' 9' 250lbs. Above a certain bmi, the safety equipment just won't fit.

We don‚Äôt have to ask what would Jesus do?  We already know. If you are religious, you should seek advice from a pastor or priest or rabbi on your marriage.  Not 20 year olds on reddit.

Finally you can‚Äôt get rid of her because she‚Äôs still the mother of your kids.  She may get custody of your kids and she may go back to working if you can‚Äôt support her financially in the way she‚Äôs used to."

I've probably given more genuine and heartfelt advice on here than the bulk of commenters whose only input is ""she's a gross wh*re/b*tch, run away."" To men a lot of the time, too!

Edit: forgot to respond to your middle comment. There is nothing inherently demeaning or degrading about engaging in sex work. Anyone who thinks there is has some internalized issues they need to work through."
I think that you should just support her plans and be there for her if she needs it.

"I mean, if he hates tattoos and you get one, hes within his rights to be grossed out or whatever and break up with you. Personally, I think it's a rather extreme reaction to a pretty commonplace occurrence,  but we all have something(s) we just cant deal with, and maybe tattoos just horrify him to no end. 

I dont know if hes being controlling or not, to be honest. You're a better judge of that than I am- you know him. I can only say what *I* would do in your place- which is whatever the fuck I want. To be fair, though, if I wanted to sharpen my teeth into points and my husband was like ""I'd really rather you not"", I probably wouldnt. My teeth weren't pointy when we met, started dating, and got married so altering my appearance in such an extreme fashion and expecting him to not feel any kind of way about it would be unreasonable. Basically, how much do you want that tattoo vs how much do you want that boyfriend? Either answer is okay, but you do have to decide."

"Just because he's not ready to get too serious or settled within his life, doesn't mean he's immature or a butt head. Who are you to judge what's best for him to do with his own life. Men are not born to comply with the desires of women.

But I agree, OP seems to know what she wants and what she wants runs counter to what her bf wants. OP, you need to bite the bullet and move on, sooner rather than later."

It sucks. I‚Äôm going through the same thing right now. My (55)husband (41)of 10 years has been having an affair I just found out about.

"GIRL LEAVE. I'm the same age as you and I just wasted the past year of my life on someone JUST like your boyfriend. After a year of dating he couldn't even discuss moving in together, couldn't say he loved me, the whole shebang. I am SO grateful I still have many more years to find someone that wants the same things I do."

27 year old dating 19 year old = red flag
Okay still creepy tho. Why cant he find someone closer to his own age to fuck
What he has done is so crazy that I can‚Äôt imagine what other crazy stuff he has pulled in the past that you would even question whether he was in the wrong. What he has said and done is so utterly awful I am not sure I have the words. You do no deserve this. Please get help getting out. He WILL treat your child this way.
"We were both serious about each other, but I agree that maybe I wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship myself. I have good intentions of being a partner but at the same time I found that working towards my personal goals can be difficult while giving attention to another person. I realized that being a full-time student throws off the balance of maintaining a social and personal life, so most times I‚Äôm unavailable to family and friends. I expressed how important my future endeavors are to my boyfriend, so nine times out of ten he should understand my decision to end our relationship for this."
"I'm gonna be brutally honest. I hope you're okay with that. 

You can't get men who do this to stop. They do it because they know it bothers you. They don't stop, they just find new and different ways to look at women. 

The only thing you can do in order to not have to deal with such blatant disrespect is to end the relationship. At your ages, you shouldn't be needing to teach a partner how to show you an extremely basic modicum of respect."
"This is no good. You admit you have anger issues. You lashed out at him for not providing emotional support. You should not be completely dependent on outside help for emotional support unless it's from a therapist you're paying, and ESPECIALLY not just one person as has already been discussed in the other comments here. 

I am sympathetic to his perspective because I am someone who needs a lot of space and people in my life often get frustrated when I ignore my phone for hours at a time. I think it's ridiculous to be expected to be constantly accessible and I simply refuse to live my life that way. However, I also recognize that relationships are about compromise. So I have become considerably more mindful of my phone habits and force myself to check every few hours even when I don't want to because it's so important to my loved ones.

Your boyfriend ignoring you for days at a time when you have expressed this is hurtful to you is NOT okay, point blank.

It also sounds like you two are not compatible. His work situation is frankly not compatible with a serious relationship. You can't just travel for work endlessly and expect to have a steady significant other. I traveled for work for a couple weeks this year and the time difference/long working hours made me extremely unresponsive (when I got off work, the last thing I wanted to do was interact with people). That was hard on many of my relationships. If that were a regular aspect of my life, I'd be finding a different job because those relationships are a priority for me.

Your boyfriend does not view your relationship as a priority.

Break up. Stay broken up. Delete all the social media, etc. You'll feel better over much time. It will take forever. Take that time to see a therapist and get some help. You need to make yourself a better person so when a high-value man comes along who will prioritize your relationship, you won't have anger issues (which is often code for being abusive). Someone with anger issues should not be in a relationship, and you won't be able to hold down high-value men with those tendencies."

If its casual...let it go. Your already starting at a negative position. If you think its worth it....it just might be. But its a risk. Have a heart to heart. Sounds like hes stuck on her. He needs to lose that ghost. Good luck !

"‚ÄúYou‚Äôre over complicating this‚Äù said to the woman who had to deal with a man with a very complex feelings hahah. It was definitely more complex than a bad day, but thanks. I love the idea of commenting on every post on this sub with just ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre over complicating this‚Äù and see if it‚Äôs helpful to them."
"Be direct with him. He likely has no idea you really aren't interested, because you keep giving him soft nos. When you say you're busy, try to avoid him, and evade the answer he very well may think you're actually just busy. 



So, try telling him that you are not interested in a date with him. Make it very clear and without any hinting. Don't be cruel about it, but be extremely clear. Autistic people often do not understand hints or other social interactions that are not laid out explicitly. It is much easier to understand explicit and clear communication. 



If that doesn't work, you need to pull his mom aside again and tell her that you took the time to lay down your disinterest and he was not receptive to it. That you are starting to be uncomfortable with going outside and it needs to have a stop put to it. Ask for a game plan to end the unwanted behavior. Be polite, work with her, and stay firm. 



Hopefully it will be resolved without going to the mom again. Most autistic people are not trying to be a bother. They are mostly kind and wish to make a connection, but don't know how. They will typically be willing to drop it if a person expresses clear, plain discomfort and disinterest. They typically just don't know that's what was wanted before it is said. 



Good luck! And sorry you both are in this awkward situation."
"Oops sorry I just saw this. 


I know that if I chose not to eat the food cooked my dad does get a little angry that I said I didn't want to eat it. He said that he wasted his time preparing the food and now I'm being rude by not wanting to eat it. That's happened a bunch of times. 

For dinner I've eaten just a bunch of snack food like cheese and a lot of fruit. I can't keep eating that forever though. 

I feel like if we were to have burgers and I just ate the burger without the him he'd probably get mad at me. But I'm not sure there."
"This comment spoke to me so much!!! Thank for you sharing. I just need to remember that there were many reasons for leaving him, and that I‚Äôll find someone who treats me better :)

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
How does this even make one dumb? A shitload of people get crowns??
"Yeah, I agree that it's strange he's doing that. I suppose it might be something that they talked about, maybe she's forgetful and has had issues taking the pill consistently by herself and she asked him to send her a daily text and he's just being a good BF by doing something simple/easy that helps her out. He also could be paranoid about pregnancy and doesn't trust her and she had to get glasses due to all of the eye-rolling she's done from seeing that text come in day after day."
"You're over complicating this. It isn't a men vs women issue. He had a bad day, happens to everyone."
"You're in pain for days, wouldn't it be less awful if he was hitting you instead?"
"So many RED FLAGS here. 

First of all, daily pot smoking leads to having zero motivation to accomplish anything. 

Second, you‚Äôre not having sex. Anything that is a problem dating will be amplified in marriage. That includes both of your behavior and lack of actions.

Third, he is selfish. If he doesn‚Äôt care that your physical or emotional needs are met, what‚Äôs the point?"
"Here is the thing: you will almost certainly have to move out someday and start your own life. If your parents are angry about you wanting to move out, then in essence, they are angry about you growing up, becoming an adult, gaining autonomy, and maybe someday starting your own family. If you waited to move out until your siblings were adults, then you would, in essence, be sacrificing your own autonomy and ability to develop as an adult simply because your parents don't want to hire a babysitter. Therefore, if you feel you're ready and you have a job that you can support yourself with, I think that you should move out."
"Your response should be, I love you but you wrecked my last car and you expect me to let you borrow this one. Tell her to not ask you again to borrow your car because it's just going to create more problems. You'll drive her anywhere but she can ask to borrow someone else's car. The nerve of her to ask then tell your parents on you after she totaled your last car. I'm not sure i'd want to be around her if she acted like this."

"Well, this might seem counter intuitive, but... deep down, he might realize he is not a great catch. He‚Äôs an abusive alcoholic, no one should be married to him. Your weight gain may have made him feel more secure in his relationships with you because he felt like the weight left you with less options. The abuse might be escalating because of the weight loss - he feels that your options are opening up again, and so he has decided to humiliate you in order to establish control over you."
"You think they should just tie that to height:weight ratio then, cause short men and tall women are a real thing ...."
"It's okay to hurt somebodies feelings. It seems lime you are being way to nice and forgetting to think and set your own boundaries. You skirt over the situation to be nice, and forget your own feelings. You need to tell the parents what's happening and what will happen directly happen with him if something is not done and to expect it. You need to tell the autistic guy to leave you alone and stop as you would any other person. You live once and shouldn't be subjected to living in discomfort to save someone elses feelings. He will get over it you may feel bad, but the world isn't perfectly balanced."

He‚Äôs been waiting in the wings to have sex with you and possibly a relationship for a very long time.
Ya... I'd break up with him if I were you. That text from him the next day should have been a deal breaker for you Love. You deserve better.
I'd give this gold if I weren't poor.
Yeah the problem is your husband.
"&gt; but he only bought one for now and will get mine after I weigh myself in front of him

This is truly disgusting behavior. That kind of petty punishment is not how you treat a human, let alone a partner who is an equal adult."
"This is part of the reason when I talk to people about long-distance relationships, I tell them to live their lives as great as they can, so that way when they check in with their partner, they have something exciting to tell them.  

I mean, in all fairness, it sounds like she's not helping with this, but on your end, you should challenge yourself to do something every day. It doesn't have to be a ton, but find something to work on that's for you. When I was L/D with my partner, I took up running, I listened to podcasts, I went to local concerts on the weekends, went to new restaurants, and I talked to her about it. Importantly, the podcasts help a lot because they not only interject a wildcard element of stuff you could talk about, but storytelling podcasts can be a way to help frame a story or a situation, even if it's a bit boring, into something interesting and worth hearing.

At least on your end, ask more interesting prompting questions, and at least for yourself, make talking to you interesting and fun by shaking it up a bit, if not for your relationship, for yourself.

As far as the L/D thing as a whole, I recommend setting some meet-up goals, and probably soon if she's seeming to be pulling away. L/D sucks, but you really need regular, physical touchpoints, and ideally, an end-date so you're both in the same place."
"No harm in brushing up your resume and applying for a few new things.  It‚Äôs always easier to get a new job when you already have one and also applying for new stuff may distract you from the badness of the current situation.

Sounds like he‚Äôs not as invested as you are. Just sit down with him and ask what he sees for your futures together. Whether it‚Äôs together or does it feel it got stagnant and he‚Äôs just not really there and it‚Äôs just comfortable.
That would suck if it was just a misunderstanding all along.  You paid for a very nice dinner.  A thank you is reasonable.
"Haha no not money and a car. I think he‚Äôs really sweet and funny in like a dorky way. He‚Äôs quiet until he really gets going on something and then he always makes these really adorable faces whenever he‚Äôs really into what he‚Äôs talking about. He also has this sarcastic sense of humor that really takes you by surprise because he will just say something out of the blue and it‚Äôs hilarious. He‚Äôs also a really great listener, like multiple times I‚Äôve just barely mentioned something and he‚Äôs remembered and brought it up later. He just seems like a good guy, and he‚Äôs always checking in with me to make sure I‚Äôm okay and just doing more then I expect."

I hope everything works out for y'all. I never had that particular issue but I know if it is depression getting on medicine can help tremendously.
Maybe start making a bigger show about telling her thank you for any nice thing that *she* does for you and that you know it's important for special acts the other person does to be acknowledged.
Yeah fuck that noise. You have every right to tell her no. And your suspensions are probably right. She doesn't need to use the car alone.  Your parents are very unreasonable and the uber suggestion is a good one.
"Do you need someone that's so superficial he would leave you because of a tattoo? You've been together a year, and something aesthetic would make him forget about all the great qualities you have? He may not be directly telling you what to do, but he basically is. The breakup threat is an ultimatum and it's... ridiculous. I get it if he's looking to date someone but doesn't like her tattoos and says no thanks. But you've already been together a year and it's a dealbreaker? No thanks."

But as a guy with...quite a few tattoos, and separately to this issue, maybe consider a non visible one first to see what you think about having them."
I suppose I just needed a sounding board other than my friend group. Unbiased opinions and all of that. I needed to figure out how best to approach the situation from as well as understand that I‚Äôm doing some enabling here.

"Hey, if a married man chooses to buy sex acts that's him making a choice, not him being exploited by anyone. In my view, at least. Unless he's being kidnapped and forced into it, there's no exploitation happening when a man decides he wants to purchase sexual activity with someone.

Though for what it's worth, some people who pay for sex do so because finding real partners is extremely difficult, and to an extent I would agree that financially exploiting them (eg gratuitously overcharging them because you know they have no other option) could be an issue."

I never really understood that, if you love someone you would want them to be who they are, right? But I can also see why someone might not think having a certain hairstyle or tattoo to be more important than having their SO. But to me, it always appeared as controlling. Forcing your preference on your partner. I would never tell my SO to not to wear whatever or have whatever hairstyle. But I mean, if I hate it I would probably be honest about that, but I wouldn‚Äôt end the relationship because I wasn‚Äôt in love with their tattoo or an article of clothing or whatever."
I never looked at it like this. I think I was so stressed that I didn't think I've been enabling her. Thank you for pointing that out to me.
"Well it was a shit time to fucking cheat on her, too, and he did it anyways. Better to not make her into a fool and lead her on until it's ""convenient"", and I'd be wondering too if ""now's not a great time"" is really about this particular moment, or how long that excuse will go on until he doesn't have to say anything at all."

"Yeah, it is your second paragraph that I was trying to describe. It just feels like it takes advantage of some people who don't or can't for some reason find sex or intamacy."
Honestly I‚Äôm super awkward and the most I really did last night was lean close to him until he made the move and payed down with us head in my lap. At that point I played with his hair and my hand was on his chest but I never would have been that bold if he didn‚Äôt make the initial move. Same with at the movies he made the move first and then I followed.
Yeah that‚Äôs super weird
Youre right. I still find that weird though. I feel like any normal 27 year old man would think she was too young to fuck. Its the fact that shes still technically a teen that gets me. But maybe thats just me

"Great advice so far from the other comments.
I just want to second that you really, REALLY need to think about whether you want to live the rest of your life like this.

Marrying someone when you are crying yourself to sleep due to intimacy deprivation is probably going to turn out exactly how you expect. More of the same. 
I would say, try and put it in perspective for him that this is making you doubt your relationship/engagement, but do not put it as an ultimatum. You do not want him to try for x amount of time (until the wedding) and then go back to being selfish. He needs to hear you, understand you and put himself in your shoes, then really try."
"I had a weirdly similar situation this past fall where I chose to cut ties with my then-best-friend for the same reasons.

You said, ""I just don't want to feel like I'm a disposable friend,"" and that's exactly what it came down to for me, as well. I realized that I was valuing her *far* more than she was valuing me. I tried many times to address her emotionally unavailable behavior, and she continually swept it aside - and one day I had just had enough. I quietly closed the door on the friendship, and I haven't looked back.

I think that sometimes we outgrow people, and as your needs and boundaries change, occasionally you have to make the tough decision to let someone go. Someone you call a friend, and especially someone you call your *best* friend, should be a person with whom there is an enormous amount of mutual and reciprocal respect and care. The decision to cut ties sucks... but at times it's necessary for you to continue growing in a positive way.

Invest your energy into people that are excited for you, and that you are excited for in return. Spend time with people who make you feel really good when you're with them. Spend time with people you admire, and who can help you grow as a person. There are so many rich and rewarding relationships that you could be building, instead of worrying about someone who doesn't even have the time of day to message you back.

I think you made the right choice. Definitely a hard one, but the right one. Now, start investing that freed-up energy into bigger and brighter things!"
"Dude as a fellow classic car owner DO NOT DO THIS. Take whatever flak they give. I have a restored 69 Chevy truck and I would no way in hell let her drive it. I don't even trust my best friends or family to do that. It doesn't even matter about her drug abuse, anyone who had previously wrecked one of my vehicles would never touch one again. Best of luck brother."
"You said you‚Äôve never asked him about this. It sounds like it‚Äôs time for a talk. 

A talk where he explains more about their relationship, and one where you express why the stuff on social media makes you uncomfortable. Talk to him about setting boundaries with his friend on what‚Äôs appropriate vs not.

Also- how do their interactions IRL make you feel? Are you just as uncomfortable with those moments, as you are with the social media? 

Usually when people have a gut-wrenching feeling, there‚Äôs a reason behind it. Talking to him will help you get to the bottom of what that is."
"lmao ok so you‚Äôre super insecure. you need to figure that out before you get into another relationship. again, it‚Äôs a show. not real. she got ground on by a paid performer, she didn‚Äôt cheat and she doesn‚Äôt need to ask your ‚Äúpermission‚Äù"
"This is me, and a huge part of the reason I am nowhere near ready to be married."
"I think you‚Äôre just going to have to start doing stuff without her. She‚Äôs going to give you hell for it, but I think you should do it anyway. Right now she knows that she can make you stay home by guilt-tripping you. If you stop letting that behavior stop you, she‚Äôll eventually stop doing it."
"What does she normally do for hair removal? It may not be as big a monthly difference as you're imagining it is, and she decided she just wanted to not have to deal with it any more and costing an extra $20/mo (or maybe even being less if she normally waxes or the like) wasn't really a big deal."
"I completely understand her rationale, I just wish we could have shopped a bit more and discussed our options.  I've known she's had personal issues with it for years because she told me at the start of the relationship, but I have never brought it up because I knew she didn't like to talk about it.

Everyone in this thread calling me controlling has the wrong perspective.  I'd never tell my girlfriend what she can and can't spend her money on, but I'd love to give her my opinion before she does - and likewise, I like her opinion before I make large financial decisions."

"He is abusing you, both mentally and physically. Based on your description of his behavior, it seems like he's been using you as his therapist but also his emotional punching bag that he can sink all of his stress and anger into. It is not your job to fix him, and not your job to absorb his emotional and physical attacks in the hopes that he gets better. You are a person, too, and he is harming you by making you the focus of all of his rage. In fact, you may be in danger if you continue to stay in the house with him. Being supportive is one thing, but it seems like his situation is escalating to dangerous levels. I would advise you to leave him as soon as possible."
"I agree with you that even just taking a little walk would be very helpful for her. And you mentioned that there‚Äôs a little beach nearby - that‚Äôs beautiful! Maybe try to entice her by saying, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go watch the sunrise/sunset,‚Äù or even saying, ‚Äúit would mean a lot to me if you would come walk around the block with me.‚Äù

Even though the relationship with her daughter/your mother was not ideal, she probably really liked being ‚Äúneeded‚Äù by someone. You‚Äôre doing an amazing thing by temporarily taking on all the household duties, but it may help her to feel needed again. You could try cooking dinner, and include her in the process. Like, ‚ÄúHey grandma, I‚Äôm gonna chop this onion, but could you peel these potatoes? It would help me a lot.‚Äù

And even if she continues to refuse therapy, I would definitely recommend it for you. You may not be dealing directly with the grief aspect the way she is, but it is certainly very challenging to care for someone in the midst of grief. Don‚Äôt forget to take care of yourself during this process. You‚Äôre doing a really good job, but a little help from a therapist couldn‚Äôt hurt. :)"
"Run, my soon to be ex husband was exactly like this. Except first he would say he never would meet them which i found out was a lie. He is also bi polar and would get off his meds.

"Agree. But you also have to work to key relationships strong. I've been with my guy thirty plus years and we keep having to reinvest ourselves, 

How do you both feel when you are about to meet again? How do you feel about half way through your time together? How do you feel when you have to part?"

I feel like it‚Äôs less awkward and less uncomfortable to just say ‚Äúhey sorry but things just aren‚Äôt working for me‚Äù than to ghost but really it‚Äôs just up to you
Umm seems like a hell of lot to address.  I admit the only showering a few times a month skeeved me out. I am a guy and shower every day.  And I feel bad in regards to sex. After a few times he should pick up.   I dont know. Doesnt seem like a good match
YW.  You're very sweet.  I hope things go better.
"Well, the biggest problem with dating and then dumping a screaming asshole like your ex is that you have to also give up on the idea that there's off-chance that he may someday, somehow redeem himself by doing something amazing or thoughtful or kind or correcting his character flaws. 

It makes you feel awful because what you're left with is a final relationship score of 100% asshole. No more holding out hope that he might bake your favorite cake or take you to Hawaii and round up to at least 50% asshole.

Just be proud of yourself for not holding out false hope and wasting any more time."
"OK, you said a lot about him.  He's selfish, immature, takes advantage of you etc.

Enough about him.  WHY, I mean really why would you remain for years with a person like this?

That is what you need to think about, come to terms with and resolve.

Oh, please don't say it's love.  Love isn't ever enough.  So many folks love people who aren't good for them.  So many couples love each other but don't like each other.

Love is great, don't get me wrong but so much more is needed for a relationship to thrive, to do well.

Put it this way, with all the love you have for him, look at how you're feeling about things with him.  All that love isn't enough to cover over all of these crappy things."
"Thank you very much, kind stranger, we will do our best and will make it one way or another :)"
Are you a real doctor? You seem like you‚Äôre pretty quick with a counter diagnosis.
"Plot twist: After basically starting to ignore my dad, he has texted saying his dad abused him and I can ask my aunts and uncle if I need confirmation. (He's told me this many times before and yes, my aunts and uncles have confirmed my grandpa was rougher on him than anyone. And my grandpa was pretty stern and rough in general) 

I don't know how to respond to this or analyze it. He's not taking responsibility for judging me and everyone else. Thoughts?"

Maybe try addressing the problem?"

"I legit just joined Reddit 2 days ago, you are so childish. I don't even know what ""karma"" is and I can't be bothered to reflect that on ones intelligence. You ruined the life of your future child's and potentially your girlfriend's. You think that women can care for newborn when she can't even control her own emotions? You were clearly not ready for a child, and neither was your girlfriend. Your girlfriend can easily go to court and give you 0 rights to your child. The court takes the women's word over any man any day. I cannot believe that you don't see that. I'm so sorry you got to this point in life where a 20 year old has more common sense than you do."

"Yes, I‚Äôm sure that was the only bad thing he sent on the disappearing chat app."
"&gt;I have no intention of doing anything to jeopardize my career or marriage,

Then take action to be sure that you don't.  Do not have any personal discussions with her and do not spend any cozy one-on-one breaks or lunches.   You recognize the danger, heed it.   Do follow [this guy](https://redd.it/b0tdgb) into actual emotional cheating.

&gt;We maybe flirt a little at most, not even much really.

No amount of flirting is okay.  You are issuing invitations to each other for more engagement and that is not cool.

Whether she is interested in you is irrelevant, you are not single.

Get a copy of *Not Just Friends* by Shirley Glass to understand how people slide down the slippery slope you are approaching.   Go home and focus on your family -- spend more time with your kids and invest in your family.   An engaged father doesn't have much mental space for cheating fantasies."
You are not alone. I‚Äôm sending you love and solitude tonight &lt;3
I'm at a loss for you even having to consider remaining friends with him.
"No. But I don't really blame him, those things suck."
"If she is refusing to leave the house or do any activities, and she has been this way for a long time, she might not simply be grieving: she might also be depressed. Therapy might help her, as she would be able to talk to a person who is trained at helping people talk about their emotions and manage them. If she refuses therapy, though, then there isn't much you can do. My advice is for you to do what you can for your grandmother without destroying your own mental and physical health in the process. If you are overwhelmed by the amount of work you are doing, it may be best for you to calmly discuss this with your grandmother, since she may not be aware what a toll her refusal to do her share of the housework if having on you. If you let her know that you are struggling to keep up with the housework, it may encourage her to help you a bit more."
Keep bringing it up in a firm but nice way until he takes it seriously.  Help him set boundaries.  That will either work or he will blow it off/up.  G/L
"Im not talking about the movie, Im talking about the Live one with actual dancers, if u search it up on youtube farmore than just humping is done"
It seems very unlikely she would be diagnosed with celiacs or a wheat allergy and not be told exactly that.
"I think I thought telling me about the gambling was some kind of improvement? Whereas it was probably just a smokescreen. 

How do I start this conversation though? I don‚Äôt want to immediately put him on the defensive so he feels like he has to lie or just appease me. I tend to come off bossy as a default and that‚Äôs not what I want here."
"Usually I'd say anyone you've slept with (other than a one-night stand) deserves a proper breakup, but honestly, you should ghost him and enjoy it. Why be ""decent"" to someone who's been a jerk to you? Sleeping with you and then telling you that you have to conform your body to some arbitrary numerical standard in order to be hot is an incredibly gross power move.

If you want to really teach him a lesson, you could respond to him but grow progressively cooler over the course of 3-4 text chains, and THEN ghost him, so he gets really insecure and remembers you for the rest of his life.

I mean, that would be cruel, of course. I've never done it and I wouldn't recommend it. Ahem."
"My question is more about why she would trickle truth and justify the actions of her freinds so much when she didnt do anything supposedly,  I just find it unfair cuz when I go out without her to much ''safer'' places I get interrogated and she starts getting pissed if I dont tell her every detail, now that I ask her a few questions she isnt truthful and that not fair."
"Quick, call the morality police! Someone has dared to live their life according to their own choice. How dare they!

When will she realize she is only free to live her life any way she wants as long as you all approve?

Seriously though, talk about judging someone based on your own very narrow view of what's ""normal"" or ""right out wrong"". Are you one of those totalitarians...oops I mean Christians?"
"I think it's fair to lay out some ground rules about their stuff not being in common spaces, although they may not like you ""inventing new rules"" in the middle of your lease, no matter how reasonable or sensible those rules are. I don't suppose your lease has any stipulations between the four of you about enjoyment of common space or anything like that? 

If you can't get a garage, why not a storage unit? They can't be using all of this stuff regularly if it's stacked up in boxes, so I don't see why you have to wait for an on-site garage why they could just get a storage unit. If you're willing to pay half the garage as a peace offering, offer to put that money towards a storage unit instead. (I know people will call you a doormat for this, but you do have to live with them for the next 9 months...)

One thing I'm curious about -- are your roommates truly horders, or are they just really messy packrats? To me at least, part of the definition of hoarding is that it's illogical, or disordered, for lack of a better word. I'm sure most of us would agree that it's illogical to not be able to use your table because it's piled with stuff, but how many of us have a perfectly cleaned-off dining room table? I sure don't. I guess like, do they look around and go ""Yes, all of these things are very important and must be kept"", or is it possible they know they have a stuff problem and just don't know how to deal with it? 

I don't know if you're going to help your case by coming clean about the real reason you want your own space, but if they're truly just pack rats who either don't mind the clutter or don't know how to help themselves, that might be a wake-up call to them that what they're doing isn't ok."
Sorry ur going through this. You may think you are ‚Äústupid‚Äù for forgiving him again and again but at least you can tell urself you tried to make the relationship work for your son‚Äôs sake. However at this point I feel like both u and ur son are better off without him
"Yeah, only pictures of our pets. No nudes of us."
She's making demands but not really providing any guidance about what specifically she thinks is missing. She expects you to be a mind-reader. I was in very similar situations when I was your age and found it utterly baffling.
"OP‚Äôs sister is dealing with depression and anxiety that could probably be partly or wholly attributed to an emotionally abusive parent and now has broken down at the thought of sitting next to her abuser while she listens to the band that she credits for saving her life. She‚Äôs 18 years old. I can sympathise. 

As for why she went on this trip - perhaps it was her only opportunity to see the band that means so much to her? 

There‚Äôs so much of this story missing because OP wasn‚Äôt there but I sympathise with his sister much more than his mother, whose wild emotional outbursts cause her family to shut down and not want to be anywhere near her."
"You are now your own person so whatever you want, feel, need should be run by you first before her needs, wants, etc."
"&gt;I tell her it's because they're jealous of her financial success and gym body (also plastics surgery enhanced too). But the truth is, she's not fun. She's constantly correcting them, or talking about things like 'money isn't everything, experiences are' which makes me rolls my eyes because the last time we went out when it wasn't a vacation was last year.

This jumped out at me, because you might not realise that you are undermining her confidence.  It sounds like this conversation came up because she was concerned or upset at being excluded, and rather than being honest with her, you told her that her friends were ""jealous"". Yet when you are in a situation where she's correcting people or grandstanding, you are rolling your eyes, so you are sort of in a conspiracy with her friends to belittle what she has to say. You could have been gently honest with her, and tell her that people get annoyed or distant when she corrects them. And when she tells her friends ""money isn't everything, experiences are,"" it sounds like she's reacting to what YOU have said, that these friends are jealous of her because of her financial success. So she's struggling to over-correct by saying that money doesn't matter. 

It's a downward spiral, where she's in a social situation where she's the outsider, everyone else is in on the joke, so she's struggling to get back her dignity/ control by putting other people down, and instead she makes things worse. Of course she doesn't want to socialise, and she wants to focus on aspects of her life where she knows she can maintain control and do well. She's in a situation where she can't do anything right, and she's compensating by being nasty."
"How is this abuse? I was never physically harmed and it‚Äôs not like I could never be by myself. I mean we were a rough bunch my siblings and I with a couple face injuries just from being rowdy and adventurous so even though it was stated the wrong way the intention of safety was there. I had slumber parties and went to other kids houses and had a cell phone earlier than most kids, like how is that wrong? I also said my parents taught me how to be strong and independent, so no psychological damage here. My parents were over protective to some crazy level but like I said after talking about individuality and independence my parents came around to seeing the world more accurately and believing in my ability to be safe."
"A: you are not a doctor. You are a student. B: she‚Äôs not trying to play ‚Äúarmchair doctor,‚Äù she‚Äôs trying to describe this person to the best of her ability for a story. Goddamn."
"Ask him what he meant by saying you should date his friend instead of him, because that's just a weird thing to say to your gf"
Who knows??? Did you ask her? Maybe she‚Äôs embarrassed??
"Based on your past posts, it seems like you're unhappy, so why stay with her?"
Prepare an interpretative dance for her. Perform it in a black unitard with holes for your nipples and butthole cut out.
"Look, I don't know what ""creepy"" means. It seems to mean ""I don't like it and can't tell you why"". So the word itself contains a preemptive admission of defeat in any potential argument about this value judgement.  
Phrase your value judgement in a way that carries more meaning than making a disapproving face or just make a face at your screen and don't bother me."
If he snores louder than he talks he needs to see a doctor for sleep apnea. Also a bite guard for the grinding or he wont have any teeth left when he gets older
"I think it's like underlining, italics, etc to stress a word."
I have a pair of my grandmother's.
"Except he doesn‚Äôt even know if he had to have options. He doesn‚Äôt know who the father is, him or some other guy. I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you. I‚Äôm just saying that legal action shouldn‚Äôt be sought out YET."
Plus it bugs me to hear her say almost everybody is on the spectrum.
"I agree with you. I didn't communicate my disliking of the theatre after the first time we went to a show. Communication is not my strongest attribute. I assumed my having normal, everyday conversations would help to get my likes and dislikes across. For example, I like physical activities for dates, we should go horseback riding,  ""I hate chocolate so Valentine's day is my least favorite holiday because people always get me chocolate"" (my exact words), etc. All of these conversations are going right over his head."
"I (22F) am the exact same sleeper as your husband: I snore, have full conversations, grind my teeth and flinch/kick out. 

if it really is loud he should go to a DR in case it is sleep apnea. I plan to attend a sleep clinic at some point in order to determine the causes of my sleeping habits and hopefully address them.

He really should get a mouth guard for the teeth grinding, not only is it annoying for you but it can be very damaging to his dental health as well as his actual jaw. I know my grinding becomes more intense when I am stressed so it could be similar in his case and maybe addressing the root of his stress could address the issue.

Some other tips that have helped me are:

my sleeping position, I tend to snore louder on softer mattress when I‚Äôm on my back with less pillow support, but it‚Äôs personal for everyone so perhaps trying different sleeping positions may help 

allowing people I have shared a bed with to fall asleep before me.i have found if they sleep before me they are more likely to be able to sleep through it

Bed partners wearing ear plugs/headphones of some sort. This has tended to work best with people that are really light sleepers combined with them falling asleep first 

Oh I always snore louder when drunk, and when I have gained weight."

She's saying that her other friends and their boyfriends are going and I don't know if I fully believe it... But I also don't want to call her out as a liar when I do not know for sure and frankly it's not my culture as I'm not Caribbean.
"Do not accuse her of being unprofessional, just document the issue at hand.  As in ""I cannot complete [x] until I receive [y] from you.  When will I have it?  When she doesn't come through, send another message saying ""As I explained on [date] I'm being held up waiting on [her work], copy your supervisor on that one."
Are you only sending pics of your pets? Not quite sure if you were alluding to sharing nudes

""Ha! I sure showed that upitty student. Thinks he can waltz in here and reapeat things he's just been taught like that makes his opinion better than a layman's guess. Pffft, yeah right!."""
"Is he responsive to everything else but sex? Like kissing, cuddling, general intimacy? If so does he see a therapist? Have they changed any medications?"
"I don‚Äôt even understand what you‚Äôre saying. This is just like Thunder From Down Under. It‚Äôs entertainment, they‚Äôre not banging your girlfriend."
The worst part is in the comments she mentions she's lost 80 pounds since having the kid...
In that situation I'd call the non emergency police number. This is not okay.
"How does he interact with his friend? In my 20s one of my friends gaslit my other friend into believing that his GF would be better taken care of and happier with him. 

My other thought is your BF is feeling guilty about something but it would be odd to try to push you off to his friend."
"Thank you!! I am okay today. Sometimes I feel sad, but find comfort in the fact that I gave him more than enough chances to redeem himself and that the relationship failed because of him, not me.
I‚Äôm glad this post and the comments have helped you find comfort too, everyone has been very kind and supportive.
Best of luck to you for your situation, and I am always available if you ever need to vent too :)"
"Listen you are 17 years old you should be able to have your own privacy, because you're almost an adult at this point. You just have to tough it out till end. Try to lose yourself in something you love every now and then.

My parents tend too fight alot, other times I'm so stressed out that I don't know how to handle things. So I loose myself in music or take a walk to remove all my tension. Maybe you need to find something that will help you to remove your stress/and or anxiety."

Beyond that, you could also chime in more regularly about what he has been doing around the house. IME, people tend to talk more about their own mundane responsibilities than their spouses. Share more about what he does and less about what you do. Balance the conversation a little better."
"Well, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good she interrogates you. She could be embarrassed or shy about it, cuz the show is sexual obviously. Or she doesn‚Äôt want you to know how much she was into it. Especially if she is giving you shit about what you do."

She's insulted by the fact that you don't seem to think it's a huge loss, and is hamming it up to her friends to get sympathy and somehow put you in the wrong! 

She's just getting into the drama of it all, good job in staying away from it. Nobody needs that sort of bullshit. The comment above is right - the trash took itself out!

How come your folks and other family don't lend their cars instead?
Me too! I am reading this and it's like I'm looking in a  mirror. I went through the exact same thing as you and I have been with my amazing partner for just over a year now. I can't imagine what my life would look like if I had walked away. We are a bunch of very lucky ladies!
"Think of it more like why waste another chance on a guy who's already blown 2 chances with you, and potentially miss out on spending that same energy on someone new who could be great. Or spending it on yourself, letting yourself be great. 

Your ex would have to morph into Prince Harry at this point to even make up for his past shenanigans, and you know he's not capable of that. He's probably capable of only being marginally less terrible than he already has been, and you don't need that shit."
"For the love of God, get you and your baby out of this verbally abusive relationship. You've given birth to a tiny incredible human, you're a strong woman you and don't deserve to be treated this way.

You are going through the toughest years of your life, and they are made tougher by somebody who doesn't love and support you both mentally and physically. 

Make plans for your birthday without him like he suggested, enjoy your cake day, and then look on for a brighter future with somebody who loves you."
"If you felt weird messaging him that yes he needs to know. Also those messages could easily be misconstrued into something else. So it is better he know or you stop. Bc lets be real, you can easily find animal pics anywhere."
"&gt;I have expressed to him that if he doesn‚Äôt step up and take over I would lose respect for him as a man  

I like that. A fair warning and a direct assault on a critical point in one. Telling people exactly how you'll feel about them if they defy you is a greatly underappreciated tool in exerting influence.  

If that doesn't do the trick then he is hopeless."
Why did she ghost you? What's the backstory here?
"The fact that you wrote out Dicky Barrett five times and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones three times leads me to believe this is either an inside joke I can‚Äôt begin to understand or that you are actually Dicky Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones attempting to create a viral Reddit post to promote this year‚Äôs Hometown Throwdown.

If the post is real you‚Äôre either incompatible or a joke is getting blown up into a huge fight. That or you should attempt to enter a polyamorous relationship with Dicky Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones (a name on par with Doug Dimmadome of the Dimmsdale Dimmadome where repeatability comes into play) and possibly Melissa August Der Maur."
"I understand that, they keep saying if I move out I‚Äôm gonna struggle and that I should just continue to love with them throughout my college years."
"Your boyfriend has pretty regressive ideas about men's and women's roles in society. More importantly, he shouldn't be telling *you* what he wants your life to be like as an adult. He can't even afford his own fantasy.

Tell him you'll work if you want to work when you get older and he doesn't get to decide that you're a housewife. If he can't stomach you having independence to know and work for what you want, he doesn't really respect your autonomy."

"Gross AF pedophile..age of consent in Fl is 16

"You should have dumped him the first time you saw Tinder on his phone. A person using Tinder without approval from their partner is 100% unacceptable. He's not using it because he's bored -- he's using it because he's cheating/trying to cheat on you.

If you don't dump him *immediately*, you will just hurt yourself more. This relationship is over."
I guess women really can't do anything without someone on here accusing them of cheating.
"I see plenty of paragraphs, it's not a wall of text."
"Depends on how much you hate dating, how good everything else is, when you want children."
"&gt; I didn‚Äôt reciprocate. I see my girlfriend as a girl. The first day I saw her, I saw a girl and I continue to see a girl to this very day. 

Aside from everything that's happening, I wanted to say this is incredibly sweet :)

Being trans and asian myself, my opinion might be a little biased.

I came out to my entire family when I realized I was trans about 1-2 years ago. It didn't go very well. All conservative South Korean folks. There were lots of critistim, no-one knew anything about LGBT stuffs and they all had super-old views on sexual orientation and gender.

Your family **does not** care about you. They don't care if you are happy.

I recently visited my family in Korea; more specifically my grandparents. I tried my best to explain how the gender spectrum works, etc. Doesn't work. Their worldviews are sooo outdated and they were too close-minded. They did not ask me once ""Are you happy?"". They did not care. They threatened that I would be ""cut-off"" from family. (Wow) They pulled the ""family"" card on me, saying that I don't care about family. My grandparents even removed me from their will. My grandpa started acting like a child and wouldn't even speak to me during mealtimes. (How childish) Near they end they tried to bribe me, saying that they would give me money if I just reconsidered detransitioning. The last desperate card they tried to use against me was speechless. I'm MTF. I'm actually the oldest and first grandperson born in my family. If you are asian you understand how big of a deal this is in asian culture. My grandparents had 1 son and 3 daughters. Their son commited suicide for reasons I don't know (Happened when I was 1 week old.) My grandfather brought this up and mentioned it, that I was precious to him because his son was dead. He used his dead son as a guilt card.

I'll say it again, your family doesn't care about you or your happiness. Their ""family image"" is much more important than anything else and they don't give a fuck about you.

The most honest advice I have is that you only have one life and being happy is probably the most important thing in the world. During the process of coming out I didn't have much supportive people in my life and it was just my family who were bombarding me with negativity. I'm so much happier after coming out and living my life, the way I want to. Just remember you have the freedom to choose what you want to do.

  
I say just beat them to the curb and disown them first ;)"
I like that. I'm Harem Man.
First thing I wanna know is how big is his savings? This is reckless af. Who just uses up their entire savings on bills? That is extremely irresponsible and pretty stupid. I think there is no problem with what you're asking for. He has known this for 6 months. Its too late to get defensive now. Do not break your lease if it makes you uncomfortable. He has been unemployed for 3 years what makes you think he will change now? Your first mistake was accepting him being unemployed for more than 6 months.
"He's being very manipulative. He knows he's trying to blur the lines of boundaries. Of course you're uncomfortable; your relationship started via one of these apps.

But there are other places to meet new friends, and if he were truly looking for """"friends"""" there'd be dudes in the mix. When you rightfully stand up for your boundaries he uses emotional manipulation to walk you back and get his way."
"That‚Äôs what he showed me. That despite everything that happened, despite how much we thought we loved each other - he really just did not respect me and that‚Äôs just a deal breaker. Thank you for replying to me xx"
Sounds like you don‚Äôt want to admit what the obvious answer is.
Just go no contact and start moving on dude. Don't worry about your dignity. Just cut this toxic person out of your life.
"Well yeah, she could do what she wanted even if she was my girlfriend. She‚Äôs a human with free will. I was writing the words he used. Sorry if it came across like I feel like I own her or something."
"So the behavior, the thong pictures he thought were hot and he was liking and him randomly messaging her about a stupid lake doesnt mean hes looking for attention from other girls? That's what I'm worried about. If it's just me overreacting I'd feel a lot better because I love him and I would rather it be a me problem than a him problem"
"&gt; 1. No one is attracted to genitalia

Lol what in the fuck are you talking about????? Well, you just lost all credebility"
"I think you're reading far too much into things. Yes, undoubtedly, your dad can definitely be a jerk (your mom sounds like she has her moments, too), but I would not describe your dad as an abusive narcissist. Narcissists *can't* change, refuse to take any criticism, and *never* take responsibility for anything. If your dad has ever taken your feelings into consideration and made a legit effort to change, well, he's definitely not a narcissist. 

Your parents relationship is *theirs*. You should not get involved with trying to convince them it is toxic. I mean, it might be, but there's nothing you can or should do about it. You should focus on yourself and your own relationship with them. 

You're definitely struggling with something, though. I want to strongly suggest you try talking to a therapist about your struggles. They can help you identify the hows and whys of your emotions and point you in a direction you might not be able to figure out on your own. I hope you consider it."
"Yeah, that's the vibe I got too."
"I don't necessarily think you should *hate* someone over it, but it's perfectly reasonable to cut someone out of your life when they display that they have no common sense and no idea of where the line is between ""prank"" and ""harmful"".

Even if it is genuinely an ""honest mistake"", that mistake very likely cost OP his marriage. And we have to live with the consequences of our actions, including ""honest mistakes."""
"I think the uneasy feeling might come from the fact that you're beginning to view the two of you as a team now that you're engaged. And this felt very much like ""not a team move."" 

But it also sounds like you guys planned to joined finances and financial decisions after marriage, which means he technically didn't do anything ""wrong"". 

It sounds like you are both on the same page for the future - you're just perhaps a bit ahead of the game in viewing you as "" team us"" instead of ""me and you."" I can see how that would sting. But as long as you both agree that marriage is when you two become ""us"" - I think I would let this one go and be happy he made what sounds like a solid investment and at no point put your financial futures in danger."
If this is all it takes to ruin a marriage then that relationship was always doomed to fail. Once the dust settled if she never accepted the explanation then she had deeper trust issues and was looking for a way out as far as I see it.
Horrible horrible idea.
"&gt; I also don't think that it was a problem to sleep with the other girl since we were broken up at the time

Then why won‚Äôt you tell her?"
I don‚Äôt think correction is necessary. I just try to take an opportunity to clarify when I see it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"So this event is about you celebrating and mourning your grandmother. You should only have your bf there if you think he will be a support for you. If you're worried about his behavior and think you'd have to monitor him all night, then don't invite him. If you think he'd be weird to your mom, don't invite him. Your bigger issue is that your bf sounds horrible- he doesn't like your family, gets 'passive' around new people, and apparently behaved so poorly to you in the past that your mom didnt want him at her wedding."
"What are you doing today to improve the situation? I get that she sees nothing wrong with her behavior, and talking to her is probably like talking to a brick wall, but have you suggested counseling?

Put the time in to try and improve things from your end, but ultimately if she refuses to budge, then it seems you have a choice to make."
"&gt;I tell her it's because they're jealous of her financial success and gym body (also plastics surgery enhanced too). But the truth is, she's not fun. She's constantly correcting them, or talking about things like 'money isn't everything, experiences are' which makes me rolls my eyes because the last time we went out when it wasn't a vacation was last year."
"I hear that, we have had extensive discussion about it so I kind of know we will eventually want a kid. But I do get your point!"
"&gt; Their won't be a real TLDR, i cant sum up ten years of a shitshow in a few lines, i'm already doing my best here. Sorry folks. 

Well I'm sorry, but rule 1.2 clearly states:

&gt;**Include a TL;DR!** \- a brief summary at the end of your post. No ""See title"".\*\*

I don't know why you'd consider yourself above the rules. Downvoted and reported. Mods, delete this."
"Not only is he trying to cheat on you, he is a huge fucking idiot who cant stop trying to cheat on you in a way that you are easily discovering multiple times.

He is too stupid or too lazy to simply delete the app when he is not using it. Think about that. He has so little respect for you and your relationship that he is not even attempting to hide the fact that he cheating on you.

&amp;#x200B;

Have some self respect and dump this loser before he realizes that he can just delete the app and not have you find out."
He's just not ready to be in a serious relationship. I'd suggest just moving on. Minor issues like these are signs of bigger issues to come.
"Good points! But I'm pretty sure there were some people there that are as close to X as I am. 

I don't expect her to go to every party without me but I just felt like given the circumstances it was a little odd (She's brought me to X's past kickbacks that were even smaller and more personal than this one, other people there that are as close as I am to X and seemed like plus ones)."
"Same why I told my mom I had a bf. Shes very traditional and my bf just wasnt what she had in mind for me. I sat her down, told her she's not dating him, I am. Im an adult and can make my own decisions. Shes entitled to her opinions and I'm entitled to not have to hear them. She gave grief for a bit but ultimately learned I was growing up and making my own future. There was nothing she could do about it. I was 20 and moved out to live ony own."
"Love is not enough to keep a relationship afloat. It sounds like you're almost enabling him to some degree (while not on purpose, of course!!) Speaking from experience people in those types of situations need a hard reality slap in the face for them to grow up."
"It kind of feels that way. Like, because she didn't invite him to the wedding that's just the end all for any future relationship they could have? I just am.not sure if I'm just adding that without it being true."
"No one is entitled to your time and energy, not even family. Especially if they're toxic. And anyone that relies on obligation to have access to you is not actually interested in fostering a healthy relationship with you. 

It's hard because we want to love our parents. We want to be able to rely on them and feel safe with them. But you have to take care of yourself, and that means setting boundaries with people who hurt us, toxic parents included. 

It sucks, and you might consider therapy because emotional abuse is just as valid as any other kind of abuse. But I think you did the right thing. Hopefully your mom changes, but that was never going to happen as long as she felt like she could get away with treating you poorly.

Best of luck to you."
"It could definitely use an editor, but the important stuff still seems pretty clear."
Okay but people with solid morals would never ever choose that as a username.
Can you explain further. What kind of arguments you guys have

"If she still has feelings for you, and you don't have feelings for her, it's a bad idea to have sex with her at all. Having sex with you won't help her get over you, it will only prolong her feelings for you."
So your mom is willing to move on but he isn't?
"Thanks man, I appreciate the support"
"The possibility of a genetic or other disorder is something that all potential parents have to deal with.  The odds are fairly slim, especially if you and your partner are young and healthy, but they're always there.  Take some time and research actual prevalence rates of genetic disorders, birth defects, and so on.  That might help, and if it doesn't, at least you'll be anxious with accurate information.

You can always talk to your partner about the possibility of adopting instead of having biological children.  It's a difficult decision for a lot of couples, but it does allow greater certainty about your child's health."
"Listen, you have a relationship and you're exclusive, and that's enough. Your friend is out of line by trying to take that away from you. If you and this girl are happy then that's all that matters! Does she know about what he's said? I think if you can't make him back off then at least warn her and nothing will come of it. You might want to work on your insecurities too - if she's decided she wants to stay with you and you've managed to work through your past issues then you have nothing to worry about!"
"Negging is not playful teasing.  It is a tactic used to intentionally manipulate a person into feeling badly about one of their features, so they respond more kindly to the following examples.

Things like ""I never liked big girls, but you're cute"" or ""You really don't care what other people think, do you?"".  You may be right that it's not happening in this case, but there is nothing playful about it.

It's emotional manipulation.  Full stop."

"The position they are forcing him into is even worse than that - it's ""life your life the way *we* decide is ""proper,"" or we revoke our ""love and support.""

"You're NOT crazy.  Cripes!  She doesn't listen to you, she wants you to act like hired help, and she likes bullying you.  You're not crazy.  I'm just glad there are other people in your life that actually care about you...You might think about getting some counseling to work on your aversion to conflict.  Just to be able to stand up to people like her.  I mean, you DID stand up to her, which is really great, but then it tears you up inside.  Being able to not allow people like her to have the power to mess you up would be wonderful.  

You know, just packing up and leaving is going to shock her.  You're showing a tremendous amount of strength.  If she somehow gets you on the phone and tries to criticize you,  you can just say something like, ""Adults don't allow themselves to be abused.""  And then hang up on her.  Be a badass!  Maybe she'll respect you a little more.  

OR, she'll try to figure out a way to guilt you into letting her take advantage of you again."

How is this man going to be able to care for his family (you and potential future kids) if he can‚Äôt get or maintain a job? This says a great deal about him as a person and I hope you can realize this before you make any rash decisions."
"Question: how would he feel if you displayed the same behavior? 

For what it‚Äôs worth, the man has no respect for you. There are plenty of men who don‚Äôt make it a point to ogle women in front of their girl friends and meet them in secret. As long as you‚Äôre hooked up with this guy, you‚Äôre missing out on meeting a man of substance."
I KNOW that I'm kinda a hypocrite. Like I definitely like mostly everything on my feed but if I see a hot shirtless guy I will like it and think nothing of it. So I'm being dramatic I think. But I wouldn't message some random about a stupid lake if I didnt want attention..:(
"Psychology grad school will probably weed her out because of this if she doesn't knock it off. Masters and doctoral programs are not just about teaching academics and therapy techniques; they also try to weed out people who are inappropriate for the profession of psychology. Who don't exhibit the required professionalism or who are not psychologically healthy enough to practice.  You might point this out to her. But even if you don't, it is virtually certain she will be told this repeatedly in grad school by both her professors and colleagues.

BTW diagnosis doesn't as play a big a part in psychotherapy as it does in medicine."
"You should express to him the points in your post. 1) definitely not on track to have kids that soon, if ever 2) not interested in staying home 3) even if you did want to stay home, with what income?!"
"Are you planning to be financially independent any time soon? 

I would hide it as long as you are dependent on him."
"&gt; He knows I dont want kids at all, I have spent 16 years of my life being around or helping to look after a hoard of kids so I truly know I dont want it. But he wants 4 with at least one when hes 27, so idk I might have one or two when im older.

You don't want kids. He wants a lot of kids. 

This is not the person you should be marrying. 

&gt; He says I can have lots of hobbies if I am a house wife as I will have all the free time in the world, which how? 

He doesn't have a clue. But it doesn't matter, since you don't want kids, so you're not going to have kids, so he should go have his kids with someone else. 

You should go get the job you want and the career you want and you should not marry this boyfriend. I mean, you're way too young to be getting married anytime soon anyway, but things like ""the same desires around kids"" are incredibly important and you two aren't only not on the same page, you're not in the same zip code."
"I was on the other side of the conversation and it is one of the hardest things I ever had to do. My gf wanted a family, future, kids, and a life together. Once it got to the point where I knew for a fact that I did not want those things with her, I told her. It was hard. It hurt. I still cared for her but did not see that life together.

In these situations, ""not wanting to talk about the future"" means he sees no future with you OR he is going to string you along and hope to upgrade. Either way not good for you. :("
"Yeah, I pay for literally everything but those three things! 

I looked into taking over those last three bills, but my phone bill and car insurance alone would be almost $250 a month. I also have a pre-existing health issue so my health insurance would cost a bunch! It just would not make financial sense for me to take on that right now.

"That is pretty sketchy on his part.

That said, you need to do your own activities and meet your own friends. If he is your whole life, then you bring nothing to the relationship. Maybe he's feeling that."
"I agree with you. If it was going to be someone I‚Äôd be with for the rest of my life I wouldn‚Äôt care. But if it‚Äôs just a hook up I wouldn‚Äôt risk it. I don‚Äôt care if I have herpes if my partner has it and we‚Äôre in a relationship, it‚Äôs just some itching once in a while. I just don‚Äôt want to have to worry about spreading it and it affecting my ability to date people. Like I don‚Äôt want to be in the situation where I have to tell someone I have herpes. 

I actually was seeing someone who had herpes and we hooked up unprotected and she didn‚Äôt tell me she had herpes... I broke it off cuz I thought she should have told me, but realistically the odds of getting herpes as a guy from a women who‚Äôs on antivirals and who isn‚Äôt having an outbreak are basically nothing. 

OP, it‚Äôs gonna affect your ability to date because there‚Äôs a stigma. And that sucks. It really shouldn‚Äôt matter. Just be honest with people, and about 1 in 6 people in America have HSV2 so you are in no way alone and will definitely be able to find other people to date who won‚Äôt care."

The red flag here is he is doing all this to rile you up.  He is playing off your insecurities.  I also think that meeting up with girls on apps while dating you is suspect.

You should leave him because he doesn't care about your feelings."

"&gt;  It‚Äôs certainly not as filled with longing and deep passion as other relationships I‚Äôve had, but honestly I prefer being with him. 

This is a big red flag"
"He feel bad, just feel sorry for him that he had to. Talk with him about why he did not refuse ? Losing his job seem like the answer and i could understand that he was afraid to say no.   
He's not the bad one but sadly the one who've have ben used :/"
"I think we‚Äôre probably moving in that direction, but she has never said she wanted titles. We discussed not sleeping with other people right after we started sleeping together though."
You're a predator. Stay away from her and get professional help.
"Yes I have. He says he likes to hang out with me but friends are important too. Of course I understand and agree with him but I have never caused a scene about it. I know I'm too nice and people use me for it.

Yesterday evening I asked if I could come over the next day and he said ""maybe"". Now I asked again and he said "" I don't know yet"" and sent a picture of his friend. :( it seems like we aren't going to meet today which is a pity as I'm leaving the town for a week tomorrow."
"How has your boyfriend not managed to get a job in THREE years? I mean even a job at McDonald's... anything? I'm thinking he may have a disability, bu you didn't mention that. How does he pay for anything outside of his bills? What the hell? Never mind moving in together, but what exactly do you see in this person that keeps you from leaving this relationship?"
"I am a SAHM. I am pregnant with #4. 

If YOU don't want kids,  and he does then you guys aren't compatible. If YOU don't want to stay home and he wants you to,  also not compatible. Also,  if he's not working none if this is going to work anyways. It sounds like he has a lot of growing up do. Jobs aren't beneath people,  you take what you can get and for a 24 yo to be unemployed simply because he finds some jobs not his standard is completely ridiculous. 

If I were in your shoes,  I really would just walk away. You will probably end up supporting him down the road at some point and then he will nag you into having kids and one day you will wake up and realize how miserable you are."
"Okay just say my bad instead of offering excuses lol, people get so defensive about being wrong and end up acting weird. That's what you're doing"
Why won‚Äôt he get a job?
"I would do it on video chat. In situations like this, breaking up face to face is just impractical. Yeah, you could physically do it, but then that's 2 hours of driving while emotional when the only reason you even went over there is to get out of your car, talk for 20 minutes, and leave again. A huge waste of a day, and probably not a good state to be driving in either."
"The sheer amount of ""It's not about him"" that his ego is trying to make about him is truly phenomenal.

One doesn't go to a memorial service because one expects to have a grand time; one goes to a memorial service out of 1) respect for the one who has passed, and/or 2) in order to support someone emotionally as they deal with the passing of a loved one.

The memorial service would have been a grand opportunity for your boyfriend to Get Over Himself and be there for *both* of those reasons.  But instead he's using it as an excuse to create self-centered drama.

Go without him, because he'd try to make it about him if he went.

Better still, go without him because you decided that someone that self-centered wasn't relationship material, so you kicked him to the curb, so there was no *reason* to take him."
Well  it's definitely a weird thing to do. Only 3% of straight people would consider dating a trans.
Leave. Then Google Out of the Fog
"So first he makes you jealous, then he blames his lack of social skills on your jealousy?

Yeah no, he really sounds like a keeper."
"Not being invited, I don't mind being excluded from parties at all. It's mostly the fact that we usually invite each other to every party (excluding family, family friends, more personal etc) that we go to so this is all kinda new to me."
"Yes I know and actually after posting this on reddit and seeing everybody‚Äôs perspectives I sent him a msg and blocked him on everything. You guys have summarised it for me; I‚Äôll never trust him again and I‚Äôm not strong enough to be with someone like him...

P.s if a guy I was dying for showed up in boxers to my house I would jump on him  the moment he stepped foot :)"
"He has been unemployed for THREE YEARS. This cries out to me of a man who wants someone to pay his bills and make it possible for him to remain unemployed indefinitely. I would nope right out of there, if I were you."
"I left my ex for this reason. 6 months without sex was not what I had signed up for. There were no injuries or illnesses, no extenuating circumstances except for work stress on my end. But I still wanted to be intimate with my partner.

After I met my now - husband, I heard that my ex came out as asexual. Suddenly it made soooooooo much sense,and while I am happy for my ex that he knows who he is and what his needs are, I was even happier that I left him and was able to find someone who was perfect for me (sexually and in pretty much every other way). I was grateful that I ended it before marriage and joint finances and intertwined lives.

Check out r/deadbedrooms. There's so many people that are going through the same thing you are."
You know what you need to do
"I think it's a stretch to say that this girl has slept with your BF and then worn one of his t's home (which is actually yours). I mean, you've gotta be pretty stupid to cheat and then give that person a distinctive momento of that interaction. 

The more likely response is that your BF wore it somewhere and at some point has either left it at a place or someone has come over and put it on and forgetten to give it back. 

Show the snap to your BF and say ""I swear that's mine"" and see what he says. You never know, he may pull it out from the closet or may say that he left it at someones house."
"If he continues the behavior after you clearly communicate your disinterest in dating him and tell him not to come over anymore, you might tell him that you will tell his parents. He is waiting until they leave because he knows they disapprove, so perhaps telling him that you will call them or speak to them when they get home will have an impact."
"I've been through some scary shit in the past, this is nothing I can't deal with, at least until after his birthday

Thanks for asking though :3"
Thanks
The first time I ever talked to my husband on the phone we talked for seven hours. 15 years later and we still lose hours to conversation. üôÇ
"Do yourself a favor and take mixed signals as a no.

You asked him for a straight answer, he didn‚Äôt give you one (which is immature and cowardly), and in which case your only option is to believe that he is flaking on you and to go without him.

Then seriously re-consider if you want to stay with someone so immature that he can‚Äôt use his big boy words to be honest about what he wants.  His words said he wanted to go, but his actions say he doesn‚Äôt.  Someone who can‚Äôt communicate the truth like an adult, and instead *lies* to you to avoid confrontation is not a good candidate for a long-term relationship."
Make his prophecy come true. Tell him you two have no future together. Then break up with him.
"To offer another point of view to this post,

There is nothing wrong with being considerate of another person‚Äôs feelings, despite their behavior. And it‚Äôs not a woman thing, it‚Äôs a decent human being thing.

There are ways to navigate this situation without upsetting him."
You are absolutely right. I want so badly for him to see it my way but I can‚Äôt force him to. Thank you.
"&gt; Please also consider that you are allowed to touch yourself during sex with him to give yourself pleasure. You don't have to wait for him or force his hand.
&gt; 
&gt; 

I think we all know that there's a difference between touching yourself and being touched by someone else. Her problem is not that she isn't being touched by anyone, including herself, it's that *he* isn't touching her."
This is honestly a douchey response. I'm already friends with a lot of people. I just am really bad at understanding relationships and picking up signals.
Actually I thought so too but my dds made me a custom fit one that is so comfortable that I actually cannot sleep without it !  It is hard on the outside but a bit soft on the inside.   It has saved my teeth and my marriage lol
"I mean, dude, you have no one but yourself to blame if you are mostly staying because of the sex. In"
"Yeah, I think you're right in that she saw herself as ""dating down"" and kinda liked the role of caretaker in a messed up way. Like she thought her caring made him beholden to her and now that he's left her it's turned her world view sideways or something. Tricky stuff to try and convey!

I like your idea though. Maybe a simple, ""are you sure this is the best/smartest/wisest/kindest way to be acting?"" Would be enough to maybe get her thinking in a better direction without being too accusatory. Thanks for the reply!"
That‚Äôs helpful. Thank you!!
"He‚Äôs testing the waters to see if you‚Äôd stick around to be his fallback plan and/or no-strings-attached sex when he feels like it, while he is not committed to you and will date others at the same time.  You‚Äôre worth more than this !"
"She may be trapped, but i get the feeling it‚Äôa her choice."
"Same thought here. At first I was ready to support her, but then this (combined with the division of labor she mentioned and ‚Äújust being able to do household work faster and better‚Äù) leaves me wondering...

I don‚Äôt think a husband needs to do everything. I don‚Äôt believe in strict gender roles. But it IS wildly uneven given the picture presented."
Let me make something explicitly clear to you OP: based on the behavior your describe he is *not* a ‚Äúsweet soul‚Äù. That‚Äôs just the idealized version of him in your head. That idealized version is the one you want love and validation from so badly you have spent two years being utterly deprioritized and disrespected.
For me it‚Äôs wanting to rush into a relationship/wanting me to meet people in your life too quickly and and texting constantly even though there‚Äôs no meaningful conversation. And for whatever reason guys that use a lot of emojis/smiles come off really eager.
"You're right, thanks for the honesty"
I'm gonna get that either way.
"It is hard to notice minor changes when you are with someone everyday. He needs to understand that a 10/5 change is very small and tgat 'hey, you are looking great' is social fluff."
"This is great if you're interested in being his friend, OP! If you're not looking for any type of relationship though, I would stick with the more direct ""I'm not interested"" lines others have suggested."
"&gt;but my question is should I try to stay friends with him when he tries to act like nothing happened?  
&gt;  
&gt;No.  
&gt;  
&gt;I just feel like ghosting him until I'm over him but should I at least attempt to be civil?

No. 

Being a friend and being friendly aren't the same thing.   He was just being friendly to you and using you in between dates and conversations."
"He is your ex boyfriend. 

Don't waste your time."
"I‚Äôve dealt with this so much in my 2+ year healthy relationship after an intense &amp; toxic 3 year relationship. I am so much happier now but I find myself missing him, even though my new SO has only pros &amp; my ex has only cons"
"Or if I put literally zero effort/reject politely any they don‚Äôt take the hint but still pursue. You‚Äôll know if there is any attraction pretty quickly. There‚Äôs a big difference between ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do dinner Saturday, sorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI already have plans on Saturday, but what are you doing for lunch Sunday or maybe dinner during the week?‚Äù"
"DO NOT listen to the advice on here to just give up on your marriage. This is salvageable but you need to get to couples counseling right away. 

It sounds like 2 things are happening...

1. She still has a hard time trusting you and hasn't properly dealt with the emotions of being ""cheated on"" (if she truly believes you did).
2. She is using role playing to mask all of the things she doesn't want to be thinking about in life like your ""cheating"", whether to stay or to go, the responsibilities of parenthood etc. It sounds like she has an actual addiction to role playing, she is displaying all of the same qualities a person with an addiction has.

So please, don't leave this until you are so bitter the marriage explodes and your kids pay for it. Talk to her, ask to salvage the marriage by going to couples counseling and BEING HONEST about how you're feeling. If the counselor is good at what he/she does they should be able to guide you into learning how to properly approach each conversation. 

Many bad marriages have been turned into great ones when both people start working towards change which usually requires couples therapy."
"Honestly...... What would a marriage certificate change between you two?

If you are dead set on being together and such, then a legal paper should really only change your tax exemptions, which depending on how you do your taxes it could go either way as far as being more or less money....

If a marriage certificate changes nothing except for some taxes, then why worry what others think? You‚Äôre still together whether legally married or not, you still live, love, experience life together. Why bother with what other people think of your relationship?"

"Basically by writing this all out, it looks like you've already made the decision. If you're living rent free it should be easy to look for a place of your own. Break his heart, it's the right thing to do."
"He's not doing this out of concern for your weight. He wants to make you feel bad about yourself and he wants to ruin your birthday. Don't let him do it! 

And don't worry about your weight. As you say, you've had health problems and a recent pregnancy, so you're doing fine."
"You should visit r/DeadBedrooms, they have a lot of good advice on this subject."
"It is a hard transition from LD to living together.  In LDR those weekends and other periods together are special, you are both highly focused on each other and usually demonstrate that through sex and other intimacies.

When you living together your sexual relationship normalizes with all the other things you are dealing with and sex can sometimes be compartmentalized as something to deal with later when stress is high.  This is why many people in long term relationships will talk about dead bedrooms. It takes active work and communication to maintain both the emotional and physical elements of the relationship. It is very easy to back burner that work while dealing with other things about your life and for the relationship to coast or just die. 

While I think that is one aspect of what is going on, I also feel you both are bad at communicating in the relationship.  This post focuses on your emotional needs but it sounds like you are unsure of your bf‚Äôs needs. How often are you discussing the stress he is currently dealing with? Are you listening when he talks about it?  He may need more emotional support right now than you realize.

On the other hand, he is not helping this situation by placing the burden of his sexuality on you. The issue doesn‚Äôt appear to be his fault in his statements, but rather if you could do x, y, z then everything would return to normal. This is a lie and a deflection.  If this is his first serious adult relationship (i‚Äôm guessing) then he is probably doesn‚Äôt know why things aren‚Äôt working and probably to save himself from a sense of failure he is placing that burden on you.

You two are going to need to have some very frank conversations about how you are feeling in the relationship. I have literally been in this situation and made myself quite crazy about it (probably what you are feeling now). I think one of the few saving graces is my husband can be quite physically affectionate even if he can‚Äôt be sexual (ED was a major contributor some of the issues but not all), so I am sad for you that that aspect has also gone away.

My husband and I were able to come through this issue and become better communicators from it.  However, I have seen this same scenario in multiple posts (male egos are more fragile than I ever realized), so don‚Äôt be afraid to move on if  your needs are not being met after talking and working on these issues."

"Honestly there's no point staying with this guy. He's already told you that even suggesting you talk about your future relationship is a deal breaker. I can't think of anyone who's actual goal is to find someone to love, marry, and have a family with that is okay with being with someone that doesn't want any of those things. I've had friends break up with their SO's because they realized after a year or so that they wanted very different things, but that is because they TALKED about it. You can't even talk about it?

You say it hurts and it absolutely does. You love this guy and wanted to have a future together. Unfortunately this guy doesn't care about your feelings and is only thinking of himself. You need to leave a dead end relationship before you regret spending years of your life with someone that wasn't that into you.

BE CAREFUL because often people in these situations, when they threaten to leave, the other person promises to change. This doesn't sound like the case here but it may turn out to be that way. If he promises to be honest with you and have discussions about the future etc you must have solid plans in place for what that future looks like or else he will drag you along with false promises for years and years and years. I've seen it happen too many times.

  
I'm sorry you're going through this right now, this kinds of things really hurt. However, they only hurt temporarily. If you stay with this guy after it's 100% clear he has no interest in talking future, you are going to extend your hurt by much much much longer."
"Is this a new thing, or has she always been like this?"
"I mean the longer you stick around ***just*** for good sex, the less it reflects well on you."
"Signs of desperateness can include, texting a lot when given limited responses, obvious social media stocking, that dude who friends you on Facebook and then waves at you in messenger immediately after liking 38 of your pictures, and continuously sending hey everyday for three weeks in a row despite not receiving one response."
"Thanks for your honesty.   
Yeah we just started seeing each other really casually so I didn't think much of it because I was texting other people too. But seeing him completely disregard me that night was pretty disappointing, and the fact that the other girl is still clearly super into him was sad as well.  


Do you think the move is to just remove him from social media and let it fizz out?"
"Thank you for this comment ‚Äî multiple very good points to think about. 

Although he does not want to talk about the future, in his words, he ‚Äúsees me there continuing being happy with him‚Äù?

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being extremely nit-picky, but I just cannot understand how he can see me ‚Äúcontinuing being happy with him‚Äù but not want to discuss what that actually implies! 

It almost seems as though he defined my happiness for me which ‚Äúcoincidentally‚Äù happens to be his idea of happiness! Please correct me if I‚Äôm overthinking this..."
Very bad advice.
"Not at all, when I know they're saying it because I told them to so I wouldn't misinterpret something. I'd rather someone just tell me once ""I don't want to hang out with you today"" than try and hint by saying ""I'm busy"" only for me to ask several times later ""are you still busy now?""

It's good that you know not to invite them to dinner, but the ceremony is intimate and they probably don't want strangers there... and they'd still be paying a fee per person for the ceremony most likely, and dealing with maximum guest counts with the venue. Inviting your friends to the afterparty is also inappropriate. You don't know the bar situation, the venue maximum, or if they're comfortable having strangers show up at their party.  


So. Two options. Attend the wedding, or decline!"
"True, and it may help to talk to the parents first to get an idea of how he reacts to situations like this. But OP seems hesitant to be firm because of his disability and she shouldn't be."
But how are YOU doing right now?
"Could you clarify what you mean by emotionally intimate? Do you mean him opening up about his emotions to you, or something like that? How do you want him to be different, in a way that He is not currently doing?

He does sound quite sad about his nature. It would be good to find a fix.

It's good you get more time together.

On dates, they can be a landmine, since many people fear making the wrong choice. Have you tried offering simple ways to do them? ""I like x fast food place. order us some Chinese from there, put on some cute action movie, and we can cuddle and discuss cool guys walking away from explosions and not looking back."" Or whatever you want for a date."
"She will be alone because of her choices to abuse you and push you away instead of treating you with love and respect.

Definitely therapy - and try reading the books ‚ÄúBoundaries‚Äù, ‚ÄúEmotional Manipulation‚Äù and ‚ÄúCodependent No More‚Äù, because you will need all the support you can get.  It‚Äôs time to stop setting yourself on fire to keep your mother warm, and stop submitting to her control and abuse to keep the peace.  Good luck."
"I'm sorry you are in this situation. I can only imagine how tough it can be. 

Think about what you want and what is important to you. It sounds like you want to continue seeing her. But your parents may or may not come around. Also, I'm not sure where you live or your culture, however, will your family experience real backlash if you continue dating? Or are their concerns an over reaction? 

Assuming that your family doesnt come around, the best advice I can give you is to set healthy boundaries and learn how to deal with hard situations. Also keep the situation in perspective. If they move, they choose to move (unless a mob of people forced them out of the city). If they stop talking to you, they made that decision. 

Good luck."
"I don‚Äôt know, I think he should learn that someone not being interested is a valid reason for declining a date.  She can explain that she doesn‚Äôt have romantic feelings for him and can‚Äôt change her feelings, but it seems bad to make up a boyfriend."
"Thank you. I will check out ""Come As You Are.""

&gt; Now I realize I can get other kinds of non-sexual connection to validate our bond, and I ask for what I need.

What are some examples of  non-sexual connection that validate your bond?"
Good point. I think the finer details of this are outside OP's mandate to teach this young man. If she wants a gentle out this may be it.
"Do you believe him when he says that he‚Äôs sorry? 

Some people lash out and say the painful truth when mad, others say whatever they feel will cause pain, regardless of if it‚Äôs true. 

Either way, this is an extremely toxic way to deal with anger and will always lead to unnecessary pain. He needs to deal with his anger management. 

You are under no obligation to move on if you‚Äôre still upset. It doesn‚Äôt do any good to just idly stew in your anger, but it‚Äôs fine to take some time to reason through your emotions. 

Do you think he can get better? Are you willing to wait for that happen?"
"Thank you for explaining this. Do you mind if I ask, does it hurt your feelings when someone is that blunt with you? I think sometimes we avoid being blunt with people because we're really afraid of hurting feelings. That's why we might try to drop hints, or tiptoe around being Direct. Your answers are helping me understand why directness is more appropriate. Thank you so much for your honesty."
"Of course, help is never a bad thing! I will pray for your healing, thank you for the advice:)"

"or at least give the impression you dont want to pursue them. have them want you. if you give out your intentions, its almost like an off switch. women would get the impression ""oh hes only talking to me because he wants x y z."" but if your intentions arent so percise it makes you aloof and they will want to know more."

"Your boyfriend is delusional and selfish.

Do not marry him and please consider breaking up.  He wants to rob you of your freedom and autonomy and wants to use your parents so he can continue to be lazy.  

Also....kids is a dealbreaker.  You two are incompatible."
"I don't blame the wife, what you're telling her to believe is an EXCEPTIONALLY hard sell (even if true).

If he actually wanted to hookup, why use your account and not his/a throwaway?

If he wanted to ruin your life:

1. PM someone anonymously about hooking up
2. NOT a public post the wife can look up by searching his account
3. She'd have to manually go through your PMs on your account to find this, which means she's probably already suspicious.

This seems like such a convoluted way to take a stab at someone when the guy could just post something racist as you or equally shitty.  I don't think 99% of spouses would believe this, even if this really really odd scenario is exactly as laid out, the wife has a damn good reason to want to leave."
"&gt; How can I make him understand this while also supporting him and encouraging him that I AM ready for this step?

You can't grow up for him.  Only he can do that."

"You're 29, don't know the meaning of a common phrase, but I'm the one with a problem...sure."

"In my opinion, you have one option - leave him
 You're young. Very, very young. You have no reason to tolerate his lies and deceit. Have high standards for yourself and you will find the right guy."
"People are attacking you and your bf but it's possible that his love language is words of affirmation, and maybe yours is different so it doesn't come as naturally to you. A suggestion about how to compliment him without it seeming forced: do it when he takes his shirt/clothes off in front of you. I LOVE when my SO is getting changed and I'll say ""Dayummmm look at you!"". He'll start flexing in the mirror and I find it very endearing. He does the same to me. Or when you grab his arm while you're walking: ""Ooh, your biceps are so firm!"". When you hug him from behind, rub his abs and say ""Look at them abs!"" It's cheesy but it brings me joy to say those things and I absolutely mean it. I think this is more organic than randomly saying ""You look buff!"""
"Here's the thing with autism. Your wonderful baby is born and everything seems fine, you bond with your child, love them fiercely for around 18 months before you begin to notice little differences. Would that totally make you 180 and hate your kid? No, of course not, you adapt and you cope, and you do anything that your child needs.
It isn't something that you plan for and is isn't just special people that are given special children, or any of the other trite bs that people spout. We are just normal average parents that never thought we'd end up in this boat, yet here we are, and we still love our kids and do our best for them like everybody else."
"Calling a 24 year old a ""younger girl"" is gross in itself. Just saying, if you're gonna be pointing out that they're both legal consenting adults, then accept that she's a grown woman and call her that.

"It sounds like he needs space from the relationship to focus on himself and his mental health. That being said, you shouldn't stay in a relationship where your needs aren't being met indefinitely. You should reach out to him and try to put a timeline on this ""space"". If he doesn't know how long he may need space from you for, then honestly, you have to be ready to move on, because the blunt truth is he may never be able to be the partner you need him to be again."
Thanks! That is really helpful
"We did argue, but there are a lot more things I did not go into detail for anyone who does not have ""all the facts"". I was not emotional abusive to my fiance, we differ in how we express our feelings/how we express love. I am a very verbal while he expresses through actions - and there would be arguments where we did not communicate on the same level. We never name called or did bad behavior such as that. My fiance also suffers from anxiety, which does play a part in how things work. I do not believe that my fiance cheated on me, he just is not that man. We spent almost every day together. I am trying to work through this as best as I can, and trying to talk to him and make sure we both get the feelings straight and the help we both need. Yes, we both have different standards of what we consider ""normal"" but I do have to come to reality that this will be different and I will need to experience life differently now."

"&gt;Some people like using dating apps for self validation, not necessarily to cheat

The very act of using a dating app when you're in a monogamous relationship is already cheating. If he needs validation that bad he should get therapy."
"Don't listen to people tell you that a long distance relationship won't work just because you are young. It sounds like you and your boyfriend have a very strong connection and are very loyal to each other and in love. This is great, it means you are both willing to put 110% into the relationship, which is definitely what you need in these circumstances.

My boyfriend and I are also long(ish) distance while I'm away at uni and he's at home. The trip is about an hour and a half. We make it work by constantly texting, calling/facetiming every night, and he will either come up to visit me on the weekends or I will go back home and see him. 

If you really love each other, and its meant to be, it will work. It will definitely be hard to adjust at first, but if you both have trust in each other, 4 years will go by in no time, and you will be stronger by the end of it."
"Baby showers are usually only for a first-born child/first-time mom. After that, mom and dad have the stroller, the high chair, and all the other $$ baby items. 

The exception is when there‚Äôs a big age gap between kids. Maybe mom and dad thought they were done having children and got rid of all the baby stuff. Then, on purpose or on accident, here comes another baby 8 years later and suddenly they need more baby gear. 

Also, first kid or not, it‚Äôs often considered tacky to throw one‚Äôs own baby shower. Usually someone else (grandma, best friend, sister, etc) hosts the shower."
"&gt;didn't tell you about it until he's ready to break it off without chance of working on it..

For serious, committed relationships, this is the most unfair thing you can do. If you've made a serious commitment like getting engaged or married, moving in together, or having a child you owe it to your SO to work on it before you give up."
Is that Herpes Simplex?
"So why did she never go see a doctor about the painful sex? If you want to try and get back together, then ask her out again. Move on if she's not interested. You're not doing yourself any favors by keeping yourself in this limbo."
Sometimes it is hard to notice changes with someone when you are around them all the time.  Tell him that you love him and are proud of him for gaining confidence.
"Also, society as a whole does not comment on male physical appearance the way it does for women - *exactly who are all these people giving him compliments*? 

Unless he‚Äôs got a bunch of gym buddies that all workout together it sounds made up. He‚Äôs insecure and fishing for compliments."
"You‚Äôre not a bad boy, you‚Äôre just 22. Swearing and going out is pretty ubiquitous at most ages but especially your early 20s. Just go for it!"
"Your relationship has run its course, young one. Happens a thousand times a day.

You're somewhat fortunate, although I know it doesn't feel that way right now. He's done everything but put down runway lights and a sign at the end of the runway saying "" I'm cheating on you or I'm about to. If you continue to believe my excuses, then it's really on you."" He's made your decision easy.

Don't let him play you anymore. Learn from the relationship and know better next time. It's all a part of becoming a mature young woman, learning to recognize a jackass."
"You‚Äôre right, let‚Äôs approach this scientifically. 

Change all your dating profile pictures to photos of your penis. And ONLY your penis. Give no other physical characteristics. Give no personality traits.

I‚Äôll put up a profile that contains photos of everything EXCEPT what‚Äôs between my legs. Tits, ass, hair, face, legs, feet, etc. The whole shebang.

We‚Äôll count who gets the most responses. Sound fun? I‚Äôm pumped! Been a while since college, I‚Äôm ready for some research."
"You're right. I do make that choice to live the way I do. A few months ago, heck a few weeks ago, I would have made this same point! 

I never thought I would get into a relationship before I graduated from law school. So, the idea of dragging anyone into this messed-up situation just did not cross my mind. I know how naive that sounds.

I am on a scholarship, but it comes with limits on what I can do regarding a job. The time constraints of law school and everything that goes into pursuing a career in law combined with the imposed limits of my scholarship rules out getting a job. At least for the near future. 

I have accepted that this is my current financial situation, so I have to work with what I have.

That's awesome that you were able to make that happen! I hope your relationship with your Mom has improved since then. Hopefully, once this is behind me, I can do the same with my Dad."
"&gt;By asking how you can make him understand is your way of trying to take responsibility for something you have no responsibility for. Because if you can take responsibility, that means you can fix it. And that way you get to stay with your boyfriend and everything will be okay. And it's so distressing when you learn that there are some things you can't fix. Sometimes in a relationship, it's the other person who has to do the fixing, and you have no control over that, and it really sucks. Especially when you're the kind of person who likes to have control over things, and you like to fix things yourself.

I wish I could give you gold for everything you just said but ESPECIALLY for this paragraph."
You dont think straight men are attracted to vaginas? You've lost your mind if you think that's the norm.
"Unless he is going to make you spend time there, I don‚Äôt see how him owning the house is different from him having the worth of it in the bank, he‚Äôs just storing some of his worth in an investment property. It‚Äôs not really making a decision for you any more than switching to a different type of account is, *unless* you think he‚Äôs going to make you stay at the house and you don‚Äôt want to."
"&gt; he is always checking out other girls and commenting on them, and although he says he just does it to rile me up, it‚Äôs making me feel very insecure about myself. He knows this but still does it.

That's just flat-out rude and unacceptable. This also feels like a cover for him to check out other girls in front of you openly (similar to ""I'm just joking!"" as a defense to saying something someone else does not like at all). But even if that's his genuine reason for saying those things to you, that's terrible. While it can be funny to poke fun at someone a bit if they exhibit some slight irritation, you have to know limits and be willing to stop (and apologize *and* stop) when it's clear that it's actually a serious issue.

**Also,** does he meet up with guys for drinks, too? Does he try to hang out with these women one-on-one or in group settings? There are social meet-up apps and online forums he can use to meet people in group settings. I think meeting someone through an app, similar to how he met you, for drinks or one-on-one for what appears to be a date by context (*even if* that's not his intent, which I suspect it is his intent) is not okay."
"So, I just had this happen with my boyfriend, I caught him on Tinder while sitting on the couch at my place. Want to know what happened? He cheated on me with a girl from Tinder and broke up with me for her.

Leave him now."
"I agree to a certain point, I feel it's a slight double standard though. I've heard plenty of girlfriends/wives openly say ""hes hot"", whether they were joking or not (most of the time, not and usually it's in reference to an actor or whatever) AND while their SO is right there.

Looking/liking shouldn't be associated with actual intention."
"Leave his ass. He's hid tinder from you on atleast 2 known times. As well as blatantly lying your face and using tinder after he promised he wouldn't. Hes not just bored, hes looking for something else. It's not your fault, it never will be. If hes not mature enough to say how hes feeling now, how do you think thatll turn out in a year? Or 5? If he seriously respected you and wanted to keep you he wouldn't be a) on tinder in the first place and b) lying and hiding it. You're worth more than that, but I think you already know it."
"Why does no here having a problem with him taking drugs every day/every week? Where I come from marihuana is illegal. Also it makes people dumb and lazy and you also experience that he lost a big part of his libido.
You say you have great conversations, but talking will not keep you warm at night. You can talk to a friend but in general they dont fuck you and make you scream with pleasure. Tell him what you need, stand in for yourself and do not continue as his fleshlight. If he really wants to spend his life with you, he will change"
"Yeah, imagine someone else told you this. 

You wouldn't hesitate to tell them to leave this loser, right?

This guy is trash.  You know he's trash.  But he's really attractive, right?  Attractive is not the same as a good boyfriend.  You will learn this lesson in multiple forms as you date.  Consider this your first lesson.  Move on, and grow from it.  

He will lie to you, because he values what you have physically over what you have emotionally.  The only thing about your emotions he values is their ability to be manipulated.

Get out before you wind up with an STI."
"This is really good advice. If they don't have kids, it may be easier to just end this."
"OP, I *wish* that I had had the foresight you show here with one of my past partners. He never lasted longer than a couple of months in a job and I frequently had to cover all of the rent and shared expenses as a result. It was one of the biggest breaking points for me in the end.
You are totally right to make him have a full time job before moving in. I'd even say you should ensure he keeps it for a set period of time, too. I'd also say that in your shoes, completely reevaluating the relationship based on his refusal and reaction is totally warranted. I'd be worried he would honestly come around at this point.
Kudos to looking out for yourself on this!"

"My SO and I have opposite sleep habits: they're a morning person, I'm an evening person, they get sleepy at 10, I need less sleep but won't wake up in the morning etc. Our schedules are off by about 1,5 hours. I've been the one to adjust, mostly, because they just fall over at ten, nothing to be done. We have a compromise like yours, where I usually stay awake longer and they are quiet around me in the morning. I admit I've found it frustrating that late nights together are mostly out - on the other hand the extra sleep is beneficial to me too. Works fine all in all, we're both happy."
"I'm so, so sorry. My heart hurts for you. I don't think you're overreacting to your boyfriend's callous reaction. He sounds like a shitty partner and this is just the thing that's tipping the scales. I don't know the extent of your enmeshed finances, if it's a lot then maybe you should talk to a lawyer, but I'm 100% team moving away and living with your dad's girlfriend. You should be with the people who care about you and want the best for you and this guy isn't it."
"Does the why matter? All reasons lead to the same source. He wants to make connections with other women. Whether it‚Äôs for a thrill and ego boost, cheating, or finding a new mate to overlap relationships. 

Breaking up is painful, delaying it means adding the pain of ongoing mistreatment. 

Find someone to talk to yourself, to deal with this pain and explore your reluctance to clear mistreatment."
"I mean, he doesn't get immediately angry anymore and our over all communication has gotten 10x better. He finally had a real job, and has been much more appreciative as a general rule.

However, something someone else asked about if he ever has genuine humility is hitting something for me. I used to tell him he needed to recognize when being humble is necessary but I'm not sure that stuck."
"I think we need some more details....would he have been fired if he refused?   Does he have difficulty finding employment?  Are you a vegetarian?  Why were the birds needing to be removed?  If you don't know how strict his boss is, then why don't you ask him?

Many animals are killed for being pests.  It's a bit sad to say but it's true.  Finding a perfect balance between human and animal habitats is clearly not something we have perfected nor will it be for some time.  Is that your boyfriends fault?

It sounds like he is remorseful and is not happy he had to do what he did.  Perhaps you are being selfish in making it about your feelings instead of his.  I feel at the least you guys need to talk it out more and understand the situation and each-others feelings before you get angry with him.

There are a lot of people on this sub that comment and I think are smarter than me with this sorta stuff, so maybe I'm wrong if anyone wants to comment."
Oh honey. Life is going to be rough for you.
"I think the fact that as a straight man, the fact that he's actively and specifically seeking friendship with women somewhat eyebrow raising. 

Men in relationships can develop friendships with women through natural situations like work, mutual friends, joining the same homing group or whatever or but actively seeking female friends by asking strangers on date-like activities is just poorly disguised looking around. If he's so lonely there's a ton of men he could go make friends with. You being weary of his innapropriate  obsession with female ""friends"" is not the cause if his loneliness. His lack of genuine behavior is. 

Face it hun, you're a place holder til he finds someone else he vibes with more."

"I mean she's got this a bit backwards. If she's  hosting her own shower and wanting to be in control, shes paying for it and people bring gifts.

If a friend(s) is hosting it they pay for it and she just shows up. 

Its like she's trying to have both. You need to clarify to your friend a) how much more $ you're willing to pitch in, if at all. Like to the dollar. b) reminder her that as the hostess/planner she can't keep asking you to pay for her event as that wasn't discuss previously. 

Girl is being an entitled fool. She's too broke for this glam shower life."
Congratulations!
"Listen, I'm a dude who is friends with mostly women; I find that I just get along with them somewhat better than with guys, so I think him making friends with mostly or even only girls is A-OK. What's NOT ok is that he 1. Does it BEHIND HER BACK which makes things very suspicious, and 2. Intentionally tries to ""rile her up"". That second point especially is REALLY fucked up, and is more than enough reason to, if serious talks don't bear fruit, end the relationship."
Everythings helpful man im still trying to see if i should carry this on as im not fully sure myself thats why im asking for advice. Peace and love bro
"&gt;We had a really bad fight 2 weeks ago because of something I did that annoyed him, he was verbally abusive (name calling, letting me know i was useless, saying he was done with us and using body language to intimidate me). 

In relationships we all learn as we go, but that should have been your cue to end it and block him. Now that it's turned physical and you'res still with him, he's already learned from you that he can physically abuse you and you'll stick around. 

DO NOT stick around and let him eventually hurt you so badly that you end up in the hospital. Leave him, *now.* As someone who's been there a couple times, it does not get better."
"It‚Äôs not a selfish thing to be afraid of having a special needs child ‚Äî what is selfish is IF you do have one, you deliberately don‚Äôt give them as much care as they should be given because say, that they‚Äôre a headache. 

Personally one of the reasons why I don‚Äôt want to have kids because autism runs in the family for me, as well as other mental disorders like schizophrenia. I think you should find out whether your relatives have these; they occur at a higher chance as they are to a certain degree linked to genetics. 

Now, if you DO end up wanting kids, adopting a child can be a great way to go at it. Make sure you are on the same page with your fianc√©e on adoption though as well as your concerns on the issue. It‚Äôs always good to go through these things."
"If you dont have the money to either rent a Uhaul or rent a storage unit, then just leave what you can't carry (or sell it on craigslist) and go. You can get more shit later. If you're worried about not having a bed, use your craigslist money (from selling your shit) and buy a decent blow up bed. They come with pumps you can just plug in to inflate. If you're worried about dressers or whatever, but cardboard ones (or the plastic ones, like Sterilite makes) and use those until you can upgrade. Stuff is just stuff. You can get more stuff. 

If I come off flippant, that's not my intent. I know what it feels like to just leave someplace- as in gather what I can carry and leave the rest- and it sucks because we all love our shit, that's why we have it. But it sucks worse to stay in a situation like yours.  You may miss your old shit from time to time, but you'll miss your sanity and self esteem more.

There is a 0.14% chance your kid will have downsydrome.

This dude has been using you from day 1. You really need to stop letting yourself be used by him. Please, go to ""loveisrespect.org"" and read the materials there. Also, find a free online PDF of ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft. You are in a toxic and abusive relationship and both these resources will give you insight into toxic relationships and why you have to leave him."
"I feel like everyone is way too quick to demonize this guy. Your mom disinvites him from the wedding. If I had that happen to me, and my SO was having another family event, guess what? I wouldn‚Äôt want to go. Especially at something as emotional as a memorial. If the family is going to be there, and they‚Äôd expressed to me in the past that they didn‚Äôt want me at family events, then I wouldn‚Äôt want to violate their request, especially at a memorial. That doesn‚Äôt come from a place of egotism, that comes from a place of respect for the family.

Maybe he doesn‚Äôt want to go as a way of getting back at your mother, and that‚Äôs immature and inappropriate, but I don‚Äôt know his motives."
"I get defensive when I get criticized, and I take his emotions personally when they aren't personal. I've been aware for awhile but it's like I get compelled to keep talking or make excuses. Thank you! I'll do some more reflecting."
"And also...why is he unemployed after 3 years? Why is OP okay dating somebody who has to rely on others for income, on top of draining his savings? OP says she wants stability, so why has she remained with someone for this long incapable of demonstrating that one life skill?"
"he wouldn't lie to you if he respected you. he wouldn't lie to you if he wants you to trust him. he says that he loves you, but i'm not convinced that this is true. his actions, re-installing tinder, don't match his words. his actions say that he doesn't love you. the best thing that you can do under the circumstances is to tell him to pack up his stuff and leave."
"Because you don‚Äôt seem to put any blame at all on this friend, and instead resent your wife for having to deal with thinking her husband cheated on her"
"If it was just for funsies and he was ""bored"" why did he hide it from you?

I totally get how tinder swiping is fun but why didn't he come to you and say ""hey wana play on tinder and see if we recognise anyone?"" 

Odds are he either never deleted it or reinstalled it because he's talking to girls on there and doesn't want to lose their interest by not replying in time. This mattered more to him than his relationship with you."
"I mean, since you won't have an actual relationship with her, K doesn't need your permission, he is correct that she is fair game. I think maybe he was trying to respect your and his friendship by having a word with you over it first? But he doesn't actually need to. L is free to entertain other better offers that come her way. If she isn't interested because she doesnt like him that way, it won't matter. So phrasing it like ""step aside"" was dumb. But she may in fact be under the misimpression that if she behaves long enough you might commit someday, and is turning down better offers in a misguided attempt to get there. So the situation is bad for her if she is doing that, but I think it's her own journey to mature up and figure that out."
"You're 20 yrs old, please cut your losses and find someone new. 

He doesn't respect you. I doubt he actually loves you - he loves the idea of you being there waiting if he gets rejected on tinder. You're the safety net. 

You deserve better."
"I think it's a good thing he is saying he needs space. The alternative would be he not saying anything and making it harder to stay together until you eventually break up. Sorry this is happening though, I hope it all works out in the end. You've guys have been together for a long time, it should work itself out as long as communication stays open"
Delete him. He's a dishonest jerk and you can do better.
"The double standard the person you replied to is incredible.  They imply that the 24 year old should be free to date a 35 years old, but the 35 year old should not date a 24 year old.  It makes no sense."
Run. If he‚Äôd respect you he wouldn‚Äôt download tinder in the first place.
"No child involved but my DH and I were together when we were 20, it didn't work as we both had very poor mental health and it was not a healthy relationship. Years later with basically no contact in between we got back together when I was 26 and he was 27. Now we are married, he's 30 and I'm 29.

Take it very slow, don't let the kid know as it will be very confusing for a little one. Slow and steady and see where it goes?

My DH and I needed time apart and to sort out our own stuff and grow up a bit, now things are amazing."
"She doesn‚Äôt owe you sex and she doesn‚Äôt need a reason for not wanting it - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äù is enough and you need to respect that. Likewise, you‚Äôre not obligated to stay in a relationship in which you are sexually unsatisfied, so you should leave her and finding someone who actually wants to have sex with you. Do not cheat on her or try to pressure her into sex. Just accept the hard truth that you two are not sexually compatible and move on."
"Hey, what's the name of the book?"
"Let‚Äôs assume you are 31 and he is 39.  If his wife was 17 when they dated, then he‚Äôd be 25. To me, that would be questionable but not distasteful.  But if she was 14 and he was 22, then that‚Äôs terribly concerning."
"First, you see him more often than anyone else (and if you live with each other then you see him daily). It's very difficult to notice that kind of change when you see someone that frequently unless you have references (like past photos, measurements, etc.) So, don't beat yourself up too much.

Second, it sounds like he needs to seek counseling for his body dysmorphia. It seems that he is taking his insecurities out on you and it's hindering y'alls ability to openly communicate. 

Finally, continue to express yohr love for him and ensure that he knows that you love his body, but also for so much more than that."
"Well if you really want a better looking guy just be straight forward with him.  You dont have to be an ass hole about it, but be direct and straight forward. Tell him if he doesn't drastically improve himself then your going to have to move on. And make it snappy lol. Being like head over heels attracted to someone isn't 100% necessarily only a physical thing either. Like dont other things turn you on other than looks? Smarts? Someone who is motivated beyond belief?  If its possible that you love him at least tell him how he can improve before you move on. The goal is to leave someone in better shape than what you found them. In my opinion anyway, the world doesn't always work like that though."
"Haha, thanks. AoL Instant Messanger currently isnt in my ballpark but ill try...

oh it shut down

Thanks for the good luck."
"I had all my wisdom teeth pulled out, 2 incisors yanked out, bone grafts and fake teeth put in. When someone tells me I have nice teeth I laugh (to show em off) and tell them ‚Äúthanks, [company insurance] paid a lot for them.‚Äù"
"Just say you're sorry, and maybe go workout with him once in a while I'm sure he will appreciate the gesture."
Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. Honestly one of the most eye opening books I have ever read.
"I understand why you would think that,  but as I said,  because he told me dont touch that, put it back. It raised red flags. 

Me and my husband dont have private things like that,  or so I thought.  We have each other's passwords for everything. 

I understand the need for privacy,  but a gut feeling is a gut feeling."
"1) it sounds to me like you two might have different ideas about what constitutes emotional cheating. 

maybe to you, holding onto memorabilia, photographs, letters, etc. means that you are actively cherishing and maybe fantasizing about the past. if you are nostalgic for the past, you aren't fully invested in the present. you can remember things fondly and look at past relationships as learning experiences, but moving past a certain level of fondness is a form of emotional cheating. 

maybe to him, it's a relationship that meant something to him and instead of forgetting or denying that, he's made his peace with it and can be fond of it while also being present for his current relationship.

these are just maybes. i think that you need to figure out why you are bothered by your husband keeping these photos and letters. like, do you think keeping a photograph is the same as saving an ex's selfie on your phone? he needs to explain to you why they are important to him, too. go to a counselor if you have to.

2) i would be really upset by his reaction when you first found the box. it seemed like he was hiding it--not as if he just forgot that he had it. if it wasn't a big deal, he just would have told you what was in it. by trying to keep it a secret from you, he made it something you should worry about. 

3) it was shitty of you to go through the box when he told you not to. i'm sure many people have jumped down your throat about it by now. but yeah. you need to apologize and respect your husband's boundaries going forward."
"Sure it will take a bit, but just reassure him that he shouldn't feel bad it's really not helping if he develops bad feelings toward u, be supportive toward him help him where u can, show him ur affection and try to build his self consciousness again.
Things like that happen I had a depressive state where I wouldn't eat anything for days lost all my muscle mass and really got out of touch with my self. A few metaphorical slaps to my face from my girl really helped me and that she always was on my side. Things like that are really hard especially for a male individual in the prime of his life, stay supportive and help him where u can. Even if u dislike his physical appearance atm give him the chance to change especially if u help him he'll be back to fit in no time."
"As an autistic, I wanna say please just tell him no. It‚Äôs not your fault how he reacts. You don‚Äôt have to walk on tippy toes regarding something like this. Just treat him like you would any other person, be firm but don‚Äôt be an ass about it, y‚Äôknow?

Also wanted to point out that you shouldn‚Äôt be using functioning labels, especially considering you‚Äôre not autistic yourself. They‚Äôre incredibly ableist and often used for gatekeeping reasons or to justify abuse or medical abuse of autistics. Autistics really can‚Äôt be put into (x) functioning boxes because they can be incredibly ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù in one area and not in another. It isn‚Äôt black and white. Look up the autism sundae bar comparison."
"How convenient for your wife that after she threatened divorce the 2nd time and then 'changed her mind' (but of course kept the threat on the table), you basically run the house while she does whatever the hell shew wants. You're nothing but a bangmaidnanny to her, no wonder you're resentful. She's got you in the naughty corner when you haven't done anything wrong. She strikes me as manipulative and narcissistic. Don't stay and model a shitty marriage for your kids."
"Why, at the age of 21 are you still asking to be ""allowed"" to go places? The mere fact you're asking permission to live your life, 3 years after becoming adult, maybe means you aren't mature enough to be roaming the streets unsupervised.  You're an adult.  Make a decision to act like one."
"Both intolerance and an allergy can be diagnosed via a blood test. One way doctors test for allergies is by looking for IgE antibodies in the blood. And the first test someone gets for Celiac disease (which is actually an autoimmune condition and something you should ask your doctor about) is a blood test. Doctors also test for food sensitivities/intolerance by testing for IgG antibodies in the blood and following that up with an elimination diet, and then slowly reintroducing the foods to confirm. Anyone telling you this is fake doesn‚Äôt know what they are talking about. I have celiac disease and multiple food allergies. I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions you have. My father is also a gastroenterologist and he and I have talked extensively about these issues, and read many studies about celiac, food sensitivities, etc."
"Yes, it‚Äôs absolutely justified. Having had a sexual relationship with a minor is pretty much the biggest red flag there is and you‚Äôd be right to end the relationship over it."

I'm not an expert at all. But I have been working with adults with mental disabilities for almost a decade now. I agree that you should be clear and tell him that you aren't interested. Maybe tell his parents beforehand that you will be a little more aggressive with it. Consistency is always the best route. Everytime he asks just tell him no and that you just want to be neighbors.
"Woman here üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Ok so if this is a new relationship. Deal breaker. 

If this is someone I have known and somehow a relationship develops.... eeehh idk

While I understand that at the end of the day it‚Äôs not a big deal. It‚Äôs not something I have to worry about dealing with now. I don‚Äôt have to wonder about telling a new partner and how they would react. That‚Äôs the part I think I‚Äôd have a harder time dealing with."

Just tell him you already have a boyfriend. That's quite literally all OP.
"Would you prefer to stay and be abused longer? Leave them. They are trying to use your soft side to manipulate you. They want to suicide? Hurt themselves? Tell them to go ahead. I'm pretty sure that those men who prioritize them would never dare to self-harm for real since they are ""too important to die"". In case they threatened you/your friends/family, you should try to record those threats and report to the police. Good luck girl! Be brave, you still have a whole life ahead, don't waste it on some abusive guys who don't deserve you. 

P.S. Sorry for my bad english because I'm not a native speaker."
"&gt; He has cried to me about it because

They *always* cry, sweetheart, they *always* cry.

They cry and wail and call down all the Furies upon themselves, their wretched *wretched* selves.  Truly, no one has suffered as much as they, OP!  No one has ever experienced the horrible, slicing pain of remorse as they do!

They love you *so much,* and don't understand how they could have done such a thing to you, the person they love before all others!  Oh, woe is them, what monsters they be!  What horrible, horrible human beings they are &lt;pause to do something suitably theatrical like punch themselves in the head or make vague suicide threats&gt;.

And then *you* end up comforting *them.*

Neat how that works out, isn't it?

Walk away from this one.  One of the most important dating tips I can give is:  don't date people who are okay with sexual assault, either as a concept or as a very real recreational activity.

P.S.  I doubt very much this woman is as cheerful about the assault as she seems:  victims far too depressingly often blame themselves or try to laugh it off as something of little consequence.  Also?  Bring up that someone in the friend group assaulted you and you will magically lose that friend group.  She intuits that and she fears being shunned, so...there you are.  It's in her interest to have this Not Be A Big Deal."

"I think it would, at 21, be appropriate to either simply take the trip anyway and deal with the consequences or to lie to your dad and tell him you're doing something else.

Alternatively, you could tell him that you've been sexually active for the past few months and this trip doesn't change that. 

I wouldn't recommend option 1 or 3 if it puts your ability to finish your education in jeopardy. In those cases, you have permission to lie to him."
"While this is sudden and shocking information there is no immediate rush to tell  or confront anyone just yet. How long is your therapist on maternity leave? Can you drop her an email? 

While you contemplate your next move try journaling and scripting how you want to say these things to different people. Be sure to just dump all your thoughts onto paper. This will help things get more clear. You are sure to have mixed emotions- anyone would! 

And take care of yourself a little extra right now. The blow you took was a sucker punch."
Tell him you have a boyfriend
""" She went into Church yesterday and had our Daughter baptized while i was at work and stated that it wouldnt matter now since i agreed to raise her catholic. I was tired, disappointed and a bit confused and asked her why she didnt bother to let me know of something so crucial. ""

This is a huge red flag that she can be so selfish an self-centered as to do this before she told you about it and not even having you be there to participate.

See a lawyer about paternity laws in your state.

Get a DNA test done.

Get counseling for yourself only.

Get checked for STD's."
Ya‚Äôll want different things from the relationship and he‚Äôs clearly not willing to commit to this in the same way you are. It‚Äôd probably be better for you to get out of this now and find someone who‚Äôs more on your wavelength as far as what they want from a relationship.
"I remember due to past relationships, when my exes said I love you first, I didn't say it back, and they'd get bitter the rest of the relationship which sucked (I eventually fell in love but it wasn't the same for them). It was as if I was supposed to say it at the same time which isn't fair.

Anywho... so the guy I am dating now, I wanted to change that, I told myself as soon as I feel ready I am for sure going to say it first! I fell in love with my boyfriend at the 6 month mark. Although it didn't happen like you with a kiss and slipping it suddenly, what I did was have a private conversation with him. I told him I needed to tell him something privately and it was very important (new years eve party), he said OK. We went to the backyard and basically I told him how I felt about him and that I love him. He said he loved me too :) 

Maybe approach it that way rather than wondering if he heard you that time? It sounds like you are ready to have a conversation about it :)"
"actually - here's something to think about; what if dating isn't really about discovering ""who another person is over time"" 

rather - what if it's more about discovering yourself over time

much in the same way OP has done."

"Some people dislike tattoos, it‚Äôs not superficial at all, don‚Äôt trivialise this."
"I've seen mothers try to destroy their daughters' relationships before. It seems like they project their own failures in their own relationships onto their children a lot. Nothing she tells you is going to help your marriage and if you let her keep talking like this around you, it can poison your heart against your husband."
He SEXUALLY ASSAULTED someone and said he was gonna do more! That makes him a fucking predator and a potential rapist. Cheating isn‚Äôt the problem here. It‚Äôs that you‚Äôre dating someone who confessed to being a rapist if given the oppertunity. Run like the fucking wind.

I find it interesting that he is controlling for making decisions based on his preferences, but you don't see yourself as controlling for expecting him to quietly accept you making decisions based on your preferences."
"I in ur case would either just end the relationship because attractiveness is really important and if u fantasizing about other men it's definetly a bad sign, if u can't end it, talk to him tell him he has to get fit again in order for u to find him attractive maybe he'll go work on himself again."

"While this whole thing upsets me, I still feel uncomfortable divulging their information, as this situation doesn‚Äôt directly involve me."
"That's what I'm saying. As a high functioning autist who has difficulty understanding alot of social cues at times, this is just too vague. The dude needs a solid reason to avoid OP. Telling him that she does not want to date him will just raise more questions as to why. The simplistic way is for OP to tell h that she's already in a relationship."
"i highly suggest fixing instead of hiding. otherwise your relationship decisions will not turn out well for you or the person you target.

ask yourself why you are ""desperate"" and what it is you really feel like you lack. move with awareness. if you already feel desperate, you're probably in danger of using someone without even realizing it. be careful, don't be shitty. don't settle, either. if you decide what you want is a relationship/girlfriend, figure out how serious you want it to be and find someone who can see yourself with for a duration of time. my advice would be to date multiple people and go slower than you maybe want to before committing to something. don't just attach yourself to the first hot chick that shows interest."
"I agree. From what I read, it doesn‚Äôt sound like he views you as a friend. It sounds like the girlfriend probably gets jealous and when she goes to sleep or gets busy, he doesn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to, so he comes to you. 
I would bring all of this up to him and question him on it. See what‚Äôs going on."

"It can be really difficult to be friends with someone who is depressed. It ends up being very draining and difficult to maintain. 
I have been in your situation so many times and I always put so much pressure on my friends. I'd use them like a therapist, which is exhausting when you have your own things going on in life. But when I'd feel them pulling away I'd take it as this great offence because they knew what I was going through. I used to think they were being selfish but looking back I see it was me asking too much. Now I can't really blame them for pulling away from me. If you surround yourself with people who are in a negative place, it can have an effect on you. I can't blame them for wanting to be happy, that's what I wanted too. 

I'm not saying we have the same exact situation, you're not me. But I don't know, I've been reflecting and regretting. Before you make a decision, try to think about you relationship from her point of view."
"Yes, you are wasting your young years, I completely agree.

I do not agree that you are OWED a blow job because you take a girl out in a fancy date; you need to find a partner who desires and wants you, regardless of fancy dates, but will appreciate the effort when you do it. 

Find someone who adores you, someone who can't wait to snuggle in bed, have passionate sex, share your dreams and vice versa."
"Oh no she doesnt owe me it but come on its been a year and after all the money i spend and the gifts i give her and all the time i spent, you'd think 5 minutes of fun wouldnt be the worst thing ever to repay me

And that's what i want. She used to be like that but something changed"
"Honestly sound like this new girl is jealous and told him not to talk with you...I would try to meet up with your friend. 

Tell him how you feel and how he‚Äôs basically pushed you away after getting together with this girl. Flat out ask if you guys are even still friends.

If he wants to be friends then he needs to put more effort."
"Your girlfriend is a brat and you're enabling her.

Negative behaviour gets people nowhere with me, if I get attitude for no reason I call it out and if it persists I take my exit. If people want me to spend my time with them, they have to act like a grown up."
"I think this is good advice in this instance. I would say that I have a boyfriend, that I never date, or even that I am a lesbian because it's less likely to hurt his feelings or create a dangerous/extremely uncomfortable situation."
"I have been in the same situation as you are, (I found out he was using tinder because I took his phone to charge it and suddenly a notification pop up)  my ex excuse was he wanted to see if he still had ""the touch"" I guess he meant he could conquered a girl, at that time he was 30 and I was 24,  he deleted the app but honestly after that trust disappeared.  No one deserves to be with a person who don't respect a relationship. If you want to date more people go ahead, break up and do it in the correct way, but keeping you by his side while using tinder is coward, he doesn't want to be alone."
If everything was fine and the other person starts acting distant and weird out of the blue they prolly did something you don't know about.... That's just how my mind works idk. I've been through almost everything imaginable in a relationship and that's usually the case atleast as far as in my life. Atleast it happend now instead of later. When I break it off I usually cut all contact out of sight out of mind. Go out with friends and make sure I have a good routine to fill my day in place to stop me from thinking to much about it.
"&gt; The promising thing really stood out to me

Yeah. ""Never giving up"" is certainly something I feel about my marriage with my wife but it's not something I've ever felt the need to say out loud, because neither of us has ever been in a position where giving up on the marriage even crossed our minds."
"Congratulations, you're not only a sexist pig but also an absolute asshole to any woman who can't breastfeed her child due to illness.
I refrain from continuing this discussion. Have a nice day."
"Check out the UK-Yankee immigration forums, that's what I used and was able to manage the immigration process myself without a lawyer. You can also pay to fast-track your application, I got mine in like three weeks I think."
"Sell whatever the hell you want. It's your own business and you can run it however you like. She's being completely unreasonable and honestly, you need to stop talking to her about business at this point. She's not helping you anymore. She's a competitor."
"Often trips are a way for us to experience the uglier sides of our SOs. Travelling makes us stressed, families make us stressed, and we're suddenly seeing our partners in a whole other light. I think this is an important thing to bear in mind when you're thinking about the future of this relationship.

1. You voiced a need to spend time with her, and she ignored it. She ignored it, and then got mad when you asked again. You should be able to ask for what you need from your partner, they should be open, listen, they should care. That isn't happening here. Does it happen often in your relationship where her needs come first, or where she doesn't care as much about yours?

2. I think it's one thing to have a couple's spat, it's another thing for her brother to enter and gang up on you. In her shoes I would have said ""sorry bro, but I got this. Please let us work this out."" I'm wondering if, between this and her family not liking you, you might have a problem in terms of her family, and her relationship with her family and what they think/ feel about you. If you're looking for a relationship that would turn to marriage, do you think her family would object? Do you think they'd meddle, do you think they would cause you grief or get between the two of you?

I'm not sure how much time you have left on this trip, but if it's more than a day or two I'd probably take the next day and go spend some time on yourself. Go to a tourist place, go look around, etc. Get some space from her and her family so you have time to think and also take care of yourself, and when you come back to her for the rest of your trip or to go home, you can maybe talk about how that made you feel and see if she listens and is responsive (good) or if she doubles down (bad.)"
"You know what to do. You said it yourself, you were ready to pack and leave but he told you what you wanted to hear so you stayed.

He's broken your trust not once, but twice already. You should leave. He doesn't love or respect you."
"Honestly, if there's a choice between saving a human child's life and saving an animal's life, the clear and obvious choice should be the baby. I don't know that I could continue being friends with someone who would rather save their pet than a baby they don't know, and I'm shocked that your friends are so aggressively for the opposite. I think you should tell the group that until they can apologize for attacking you for your view, you don't feel the need to return to the group chat"
"That's not true. Many disabilities don't develop until later in the pregnancy. 
I have two friends with children who have rare genetic disorders that occurred due to mutations in the 3rd trimester. 

OP, if you do decide to try for kids have genetic counseling done before trying to assuage some of your fears and see if you and your SO have the same ideas about having an amnio done after 15 weeks and how you'd proceed if the results weren't ideal. 

Growing a human for over 9 mos is a gamble. Even if they come out ""normal"" life can still happen and change that. So this fear may be something you'll have to come to terms with, therapist are great for this.

I have worked with kids of all ages and those with/without disabilities. The crap shoot that is pregnancy scares me but we (husband and I) are on the same page about it and how we'd proceed if tests indicate something is wrong inutero."
"Move out. Until you leave this living situation it's always going to bring you back to what was. Fresh start, new place, or he moves out and you change the house so it's different and yours.  Then, space and time. And if you can't move out right away, do whatever you can to get your space and time from one another as much as you can. And I would absolutely avoid dating until that point because it's just going to hit raw nerves at this point."
"&gt;I just want to know if anyone has any advice on partners with so much anger and how they coped

Lots of makeup to cover the bruises, silence and shame.  Lying to nurses at the hospital, lying to the police, lying to anyone you're still allowed to speak to.  Then pretty much getting dead.  That's how anyone copes with physical abuse I suppose."
"Exactly this. What even is he doing all day? Online applications, job fairs, networking events, occasional work like dog walking, classes or certificates, unemployment agencies, temp agencies, any of these would show some commitment to getting a job. 

And 3 years is insane. At that point you should have switched fields or gotten a couple retail/food service etc jobs to hold money while still looking. Add therapy to the list of things he should be doing. I think its askamanager that said it but you absolutely should be volunteering somewhere if unemployed long term to show at least skills like commitment and working with teams if you've got huge resume gaps like that. A 3 year gap on a resume looks really bad. He'll need to be able to explain it in cover letters or interviews too. (Health issues, caring for small children, caring for elderly parents are the only times ive seen multi year gaps)."
"You mentioned this is a step you're ready for. A step to what? Marriage? Kids? Do you honestly see a future with a man who cannot do the bare minimum to keep himself afloat?

So, if you do move in with him and he isn't employed, and you have children with him.... do you think he'll get a job then? Who do you think will pay for the children or better yet, who will have to work while pregnant? That's likely going to be just you.

Who will be the one expected to cook, clean, take care of the children, work a job (or perhaps two) in order to make a home livable? That's likely going to be just you.

You say you are willing to take a step with him, but are you willing to take a step in this direction? Because that is exactly where you're headed if you stay with this man.

At this age in life, you really need to make smart decisions for you future. Especially if you want children (as it will get harder to conceive as you get older)."
"He was on Tinder because he was bored... of you. I mean I'm sorry to put it this way but his respect for you seems pretty gone knowing that he installed the app again even after you talked to him about this making you mad (he was sorry he got busted, not that he did it). Don't even try to make excuses for him, he doesn't even respect you, darling, you deserve so much better than this."
"OP, reread your story and pretend it was your best friend telling you all this."
"YES, I did this too. Discovered the app a couple months after we had been official... said he was using it to find friends (I can't roll my eyes hard enough) and may or may not have deleted it after that. Dump him and run before you stay in it even longer and then regret the time you had wasted."
3 years without a job? What's the problem?
"Ugh. So true. Right now, I can focus on today. Only today. :)"

"No, she is not going to get over the relationship better when you guys keep on spending time together and fucking."

"If you want to have a long and toxic relationship then stay. Othewise, you already know the answer"

"Sorry, gotta agree with u/WellBlessMySole. A marriage and a wedding are two different things. You can get a marriage for the cost of a courthouse license. A wedding, plus a bachelor suite (???) is obviously going to be more expensive. Some people don't care about the fanfare.

That said I would highly recommend against OP getting married at this stage. OP, you're SO young and yes, his behavior does sound controlling. I'm not going to tell you to just break up, because I'm sure you'll get plenty of advice pointing in that direction anyway. If you want this relationship to last I think you need to set some very strong boundaries regarding your recovery. And if that doesn't work out, please consider whether he's helping or hindering your recovery process, and whether that's sustainable."
"I wish I could give you the biggest hug. I just permanently cut off a toxic ex as well. Even though we ended our relationship almost three years ago, he's continued to disrupt my life and meddle with my emotional well being. I finally had enough, told him I never want to speak to him, see him, or be reminded of him ever again, and blocked him on everything. 

I know he's a shitty person, I know I'm better to be rid of him, and I know I should've done this years ago. I'm engaged to an amazing guy who supports and cherishes me, and doesn't play games or take me for granted. It still hurt like hell to finally close the door on that old chapter of my life. And you're fresh out of this relationship. Of course it hurts. It's the most normal thing in the world to feel gross and sad after something like this. 

It helps me to remember the big picture - yes it hurts now, but that will pass. Dragging it out longer would not have made it hurt any less. In fact, it would probably have hurt even more. Some other comments mention the chemical highs and lows that abusive/toxic relationships create, and the resulting addiction. This is absolutely a real thing, and it's insidious. 

You become addicted to the highs (which, please note, couldn't exist without the lows), and when the highs stop coming, your lizard brain twists itself into knots trying to get them back. That part of your psyche will try to convince you of irrational things, like, ""You'll never find passion like this again,"" or ""It wasn't that bad, you can work it out and be happy together again."" The longer you stay in that place of on-and-off, the deeper these chemical pathways become entrenched. The sooner you get out of that situation, the sooner his imprint on your brain will fade.  

When I'm feeling sad, I remind myself that the alternative (getting roped back into his manipulative crap) is far worse, I've never had worse lows than when I was involved with him, cutting him out of my life was looong overdue, and feelings aren't facts. This is just a reaction of chemicals borne of the incredibly dysfunctional relationship we had, and it will take time for my brain to get back to a healthy baseline. 

Stay strong, and keep an open dialogue with yourself and how you're feeling. Acknowledge your feelings as totally normal, but remember you don't have to give them power. Take away their power by reminding yourself that it's a chemical addiction, no different than caffeine or any other drug, and these are just the leftover dregs of toxicity that he stuck you with. I hope you feel more at peace soon."
"I‚Äôm not going to bail again. I am completely in love with her and she‚Äôs honestly the only person I can see myself ever being with. She feels the same way, but how do you really ask out a girl you‚Äôve already been exclusively dating for 3 years? She does know what K said and has been feeling increasingly uncomfortable with his attention."
Are you going to smarten up and dump him the third time you catch him trying to fuck other people? I hope so. Have some self respect lady.
He sounds pretty immature and irritating. Tell him that you don't like playing games and and feel like you're putting in more effort than he is.
Plot Twist. She has money but doesn't want to use it. Hence using your money instead of hers.
"you can not like it all you want, you just  cant really be mean about it. hes so far away from everyone right now, and was probably just happy he had anyone at all to go with and not be alone on that day."
Dump. Him. You're 20. You'll be fine.
"If you haven't read the pdf You're Not Alone you should, and try to Feelings-behaviour-identity model, see where you place yourself. It's okay if the labels you identify with change overtime or you feel differently as you learn more and explore your feelings.

I think it's perfectly acceptable to tell him you have feelings as long as you make it clear you're not expecting him to do anything about them e.g. 'hey friend, I just wanted to flag that atm I'm feeling x. I'm just telling you so I can process my feelings and I might need a bit of space while I navigate moving on. I'm not telling you to trying and impact your relationship with your partner. I value our friendship etc'."
Right? Angry gets shit done.
"Girl, 27 you're still young af. 35 is still young as fuck. Stop that noise."
"I don‚Äôt know how you could even consider staying. He was swiping right in front of you!!!

You‚Äôre only 20 too, like what would you waste any more time on a guy who is trying to cheat on you, and may have already?

If your friend came to you with this story, what would you say to her? 

Like wow what a great guy definitely stay with him?"
What you do is throw his phone out the window on your way out. Bye.
