Act professional like any other candidate
"Show some real class. Be a professional and separate work from social. Be nice, warm, engaging, and let him interview you. Don’t use the interview to flirt,keep that separate. "

"Yikes. 

As a mom, I just want to say I love you, you're perfectly normal, God doesn't need to fix you, and all the other things your mother *should* have said. I hope she gets her head out of her ass and loves you unconditionally -  the way she's supposed to - soon."
"Lmao this is the best thing I've seen all day. Btw you don't need to control anything, it's sex after all. It's the one thing we should be letting go in. And I'm sure your boyfriend likes it. Even if he's not turned on by the moans, he definitely appreciates you being your uninhibited self and enjoying him"
So.. Congrats!
Please have a gay wedding 
"And don't get your honey where you make your money.

i have no patience for instawhores. 
I don't understand what actually was happening 
"Yes.

I feel like the people most obsessively glued to social media are also the most attention hungry and irrational, yet also can't keep their phones out of sight long enough to have dinner with someone.

Which for the record I find very rude.  I have a rule my phone mostly stays in my pocket at the dinner table, I think if you want to go out with friends it seems like it defeats the purpose to focus more attention on other friends that aren't even with you."
Masc guys can do subtle things like wear a rainbow Apple Watch wristband!
congratulations.  level 4 Gay attained! proceed to next level
I've seen hookups in professional situations before. We are professional and just act like nothing ever happened.
You have a lot of confidence. Stay strong bro

"&gt;And what would increase the chance of getting the job?

*Not* hitting him up on grindr or whatever within immediate radius of the interview.  Basically pretend like y'all didn't hook up"
I'm pretty sure this entire sub has a dick fetish 
that’s pretty gay 
"Jesus.

How old are you?

Oh: and good luck. Seriously. :)"
"ham it up and be like ""OH FUCK YES DADDY, POUND ME HARDER"" a few times.  "
"Yes, regrettably I believe you have."
"I remember seeing a post on /r/sex a while back by a straight female redditor who was asking for advice about her boyfriend's feminine sounding moans. All the responses were suggestions for how to get him to sound more manly when he came. :\\

I'm glad the responses here are more encouraging, or I'd have a real problem, lol."
"Give him time to accept the news you're not interested.

Use this valuable time to figure out if you're actually into him, or this is your way of processing guilt.

Acting on a whim, leading him on only to realise you're definitely not interested will just make it much worse. "
"His mom has a lot to process, especially when it comes to religion &amp; gay children. It will take time, and lots of communication between them. "
A dick 
As a masc dude here this sounds pretty cool! Kinda wish i could be like that.
"For God's sake, please do not include profiles in any future updates. That completely took away the anonymity of YikYak and caused it to become a toxic environment. "
Don’t be disappointed. You don’t want someone like that as a “friend” anyway. 
I wish we could just have gay vision or something so we didn't have to play these guessing games lol. 
Yes!!! They get mad if their pics dont reach a certain amount of likes and delete it. Theres a guy that likes me but he basically begs on snapchat for people to like his pics on insta. I dont know how to tell him it lowkey kinda pathetic and a turnoff 
"Indian gay man here and I can relate to what you say. I have dated white men. Sometimes they do fetishize. It really depends on how they make me feel as a person. I went on a date with a white guy and he couldn't stop talking about chicken curry. At first, I just thought 'Ok... he's trying to find common ground. so let's just keep talking...' but after sometime it got to a point where I felt like the only reason he wanted to talk to me was because he liked chicken curry. I have had white guys tell me 'You're from India? You speak such good English!' as a compliment. I have also had white guys tell me 'You have really nice teeth for an Indian'. 

One of my exes told me that he likes Indian men. His ex boyfriend was Indian. So I asked him whether he is dating me just because I am Indian and he said he liked me as a person and that me being Indian was just added hot for him. I was absolutely fine with that. We used to call each other petnames and tease each other with our skin color. It was fun, I felt loved, desired, and not reduced to my skin color.

Sadly, I also have met a few Indian gay guys who take pride in the fact that they only date white men. And of course, white men who only date other white men. Personally, I find difference attractive. Even if my partner was Indian, I would want him to have different opinions and life experiences than me because I find same-same boring as hell. I also think that if a person from another race/ethnicity is curious about me and is not afraid to explore what is different, then I find that sort of open minded curiosity very sexy. A lot of countries with POC have a huge problem of skin bleaching because media convinces that white is sexy. So a lot of dark skinned people internalize that and find it difficult to accept that white skinned people may actually find them attractive. I was that way till I met my first white BF. 

""In 2017, the global skin-lightening industry was worth $4.8bn (£3.4bn),  and it is projected to grow to $8.9bn by 2027, fuelled by a growing  middle class in the Asia-Pacific region.""

Whats the hamster's name
I get out of bed and I go. I don’t look at my phone. I don’t entertain the idea of doing anything except exactly what I’m supposed to do—go to the gym. Stop making excuses and go if you want to go. Everyone has days they don’t feel like going to the gym. You go anyways. It’s not a negotiable. Stop letting your head get in the way of your goals. 
"To start I’m 5’0 and I’m very thin and I met a guy who’s 6’2 and is a basketball player.

He was drenched in sweat and I saw he looked attractive that screamed *I’m a straight jock* and so I dismissed looking at him because I knew I had no chance or all chances with him were disappointing to zero and none and I don’t really like imagining stuff that I know I had no chance at all.

He went next to me and I was confused, maybe he was gonna bully me or just tease me. But it wasn’t. He was looking at the Pro game tournament I was watching and asked me stuff until we had a conversation.

Exchanged numbers and FB profiles and I thought that was it. Later I saw him at the computer shop and he saw me too, which ended to us both playing the game for hours. When we went home he asked me if I would love to be invited to an after party because I found out his team just won a game.

I refused telling him that I would be too shy because I’m gay. I thought it was the end and he just smiled and patted my head and said “It’s cool, we can hang out some other time then”

Made me aww on how he was so nice and I felt bad for judging him. He was my basically like my brother as our relationship goes.

Currently he’s now my BF and I found out he likes me and has a thing for short people. My first kiss with him was when he was drunk and sad because I missed one of his game and I wasn’t there to cheer for him. The motherfucker climbed all the way to my bed and tapped on my window like some horror shit.

Its funny because I thought he was an asshole and I thought he was straight but he wasn’t and I thought my BF was gonna be someone sassy because I’m kinda not help looking serious. 

We’re both 17 and I hope we stay strong, a bit insecure because we are so different. I just can’t believe I got a boyfriend at all."
Stoned and now gay. Way to go Colorado. 
"My dick is roughly an inch long when soft, so it has shocked some of my exes to see it grow to 6. "
"Yeah, dated a guy, and fell for an abusive prick. 

Why oh why do the insane ones always have to be so pretty? "
I remember the first few times I saw gay couples in public like it was yesterday. It really meant a lot to me as a young gay kid.
I do this myself. I feel like people are afraid to approach me because they’re not sure. I know I do the same where I won’t approach someone unless I know for sure.
I don't know how somebody would not be attracted to him.

"If you don't mind outing yourself, I'd do it. His hypocrisy is poised to actually harm the lives of his constituents and they deserve to know they're about to be fucked over.

hell yeah. make sure they're clean tho. can you describe the ex's dick..asking for a friend
"u good mom, thank u. "
Fucking confusing allies. 
I'm straight but if my girlfriend we're to make masculine grunting noises during intercourse I'd probably tease her too but I wouldn't want her to suppress herself from just being in the moment and letting out what comes natural.
"Yes. 

Was on a weekend vacation with a guy I was dating in the summer.

He spent 2 hours trying to get a good ""selfie"" while I wanted to go outside and swim in the lake. I gave him 2 hours before I left, who knows how long he took, but I literally drove home after that. 

Watching this moron walk around giving duck lips made my penis invert. 

It's fine if you want to quickly snap one, but walking around the cottage looking for ideal lighting and taking what seemed to be 100 pictures was just too much for me, fuck that noise. "

"I'm bi, mostly gay, but when I was in college I was more focused on women than men. Anyway, there was one very pretty girl in among my group of friends that never spoke to me. I assumed that she was stuck up because of her physical beauty. After I graduated, one of our mutual friends got married. I saw her in the hotel hallway before the wedding and a genuine smile lit her face and she said, ""Hello Omnichronos!"" I immediately realized then what I had mistaken for being stuck up, was actually painful shyness. From then on I vowed to give beautiful people the benefit of the doubt. It's why I've occasionally been able to hookup with some very hot guys, way out of my league, lol. "
"Yeah, I went on a date with a black guy I met on tinder last night, just kind of a spur of the moment thing I don't normally let myself do. Anyway, we were having a really good time walking around downtown and talking (honestly this is the best kind of date fuck noisy restaurants), but then he asks me out of nowhere if I'm into black guys because it's a fetish.

Like, ok, I 100% understand and empathize with POC in the gay community, racial fetishization is a real thing they have to deal with on a regular basis (also straight POC, it's an issue everywhere). So I can't really fault the guy for asking. But you have to know that regardless of how justifiable a question it is, it kills the mood and puts your date on the defensive, forcing them to try and explain themselves for being into you. Doesn't seem worth it to me but I'm a white dude so it's not a judgement call I'll ever be forced to make like they are 🤷‍♂️"
"For what it's worth, I think pillow biting is one of the hottest things ever. Means I'm doing my job real good and that's the *best* feeling."

"Continue what you're doing. But with less expectations. Enjoy every moment you spend with a stranger. Your heart will get broken, for sure. But keep yours open. At the same time, improve yourself in the process. There are no guidebooks for finding the one. We all have a share of ups and down. The only thing you can do is either make yourself better, or keep trying.

"Yeah OP, that's rape. If at any point you want to stop and he doesn't, it's rape. Additionally, don't believe a thing about him being on PrEP(even if he had the bottle, it doesn't mean he was actually taking it, and it seems a lil over the top to wave it in your face). Go get tested ASAP, it's like $50 without insurance, and if you tell them it was rape, you can get it waived typically. 

I'm not fucking kidding, go get tested, $50 now, or a lifetime of medical bills(PrEP doesn't prevent all STDs)

"There's some thirsty dudes in here.  


Ass play isn't necessarily a gay thing.  All dudes have prostates, and they're basically the male g-spot.  


Anything that you do to yourself in order to get off is just masturbation.  Don't stick anything up your ass that isn't specifically designed for it.  It can be really easy to injure yourself or get something stuck up there which will require surgery to remove.  Just don't do it.  


Go to your nearest adult toy store and find yourself a good dildo.  Chat with the clerk there about their recommendations.  Don't be embarrassed, it's their job, and they've heard waaaaay kinkier things than you can come up with.  


If you want to be with a dude, do it because you want to be with a dude, not just because you want to stick things up your ass."
"Big time. I dated this guy that had like 6 or 7k Instagram followers, and you could tell it had gotten to him. He acted like he was God’s gift to the earth because he had creepy obsessed followers 🤮"
"Doesn't matter whether they're straight or gay, you're basically talking about the age old problem of unrequited love.

You figure what you have is so unique and so almost perfect that to walk away would be tragic.

With most issues of the heart (or more scientifically, the mind), the piece of the puzzle that's lacking is usually perspective. In time you'll come to understand that there are other paths and other options.

Take a break for a while. As long as your friendship is strong, you'll come back to a good point. Understanding that you're not going to be dropped as a friend will be important. And remember that most important of clichés .. all things work out given time."

The first thing you're doing wrong is comparing your sex life to porn.
"While I don't think you are an homophobe, maybe you could try to approach this as you would if it was a woman hitting on you. A ""no thanks"" with a smile is more than enough and doesn't make you sound so insecure"
because some of them know that they can get away for being the assholes they are :/
I felt the same way the first time I kissed a guy properly. It was amazing. You described it best. Nothing felt so right 
"The boy told me “Take off ya condom”

I said “Babes, barebacks not hot”"
"And did the reason have anything to do with the sex?

“You weren’t picked because I felt teeth.”"
"Some of this stuff require nuancing. Using capital letters doesn’t make it the absolute truth.

For instance, in our community, it is clear to me that you must pursue love and a relationship if you want one. People meet online nowadays and it’s truer for gay people who can’t meet in the wild like straight people. I agree about the looking for a good guy, not a relationship in itself, though. But it comes with investment is what I’m trying to say.

Hooking up with guys who are into hooking up in hope to find a LTR is just not the proactive and most effective way to find a stable relationship, clearly. It can happen, but usually these habits are just not found in people who put time to become interesting and interested in a serious relationship. It is my opinion that one is already over having sex with tons of guys if he’s to be ready for a serious relationship. I understand there are open relationships, but the successful ones usually open later once the partners bonded. 

OP’s advice, to me, sounds like he is telling young men that the grass is always greener and that you should pursue « Mr Right ». It’s not true.  Because there is no Mr Right. You must invest in a relationship to build something strong and meanigful that will last. Two successful people does not make a successful relationship. It takes more than just finding the guy and I just think you all should know that it’s ok to have doubts when dating someone, and that it doesn’t mean he’s not the one for you. Keep things realistic. I see so many lonely guys who want better than what they are. They’ll realize the secret recipe of a successful relationship too late."

Putting aside the amount of people to choose from, straight people do not have to worry about being beaten up for hitting on the wrong person. Nor do they have to worry about if you think that they could be the same sexuality as you, or just that you wish that they are the same sexuality as you. They also are much more likely to be able to date someone they meet randomly. Like the only way I can be sure that a guy is gay, not even if he is into me, is if I go to a gay bar (which are dying in my area) or on a dating app. Not only do straight people have both more apps, and more bars, but also get to meet people randomly without worrying about the first two points.

Dating isn't easy for anyone, but straight people at least have it easier finding someone to at least try a relationship with."
it's all I'm thinking about tbh
Thank you for your story.

I’m a pillow biter and proud of it!  Means I’m having a good time. 
Oh gay queens and their unnecessary judgments...
"I used to think there was a huge amount of gay professionals in the central business district of my City. Like about 20% of professionals with an ID badge around their neck had a rainbow lanyard. 

I finally realised that certain firms handed them out like candy to prove they were LGBTQI+ friendly"
But then it can become a real porno.

"1. 25 is not ""older"", really. I know it's easy to believe that everyone was gaying from the age of 14, but there are plenty of dudes for whom things get a little delayed. Don't fixate on age, because I guarantee you're not alone. My fiance (now 32) came out at 27, *one year* before I met him.
2. Accept that your first sexual experiences are probably going to be a learning experience. I sincerely hope that your first experiences are special and wonderful, but for many people they're mostly just experience, *and that's OK*. It doesn't have to be magical to be worthwhile, and even bad sexual experiences (within reason) are valuable in terms of figuring out what you want.
3. You're going to have to put yourself out there. It's going to be scary as hell, but it's the kind of thing that gets easier the more you do it.
4. You're going to get rejected. This is fine, literally everyone gets rejected and it's basically no reflection on you or your inexperience. Some guys will get your hopes up and ghost you, some guys won't reply, some guys will be assholes. Again, this happens to *literally everyone*, no exceptions, so please don't take it personally.
5. Sex is great. Making out is great. Have fun!"

"As a former university professor, that ""teacher"" is very unprofessional and probably insecure--s/he seems to have no leadership skills and has no control over that class.

I would not have let that situation get so far out of control: they should have been silenced and seated long before the slur occurred.

Had the slur occurred on my watch, I would have sternly said: ""ENOUGH!! SMITH!!--APOLOGIZE TO JONES IMMEDIATELY!!"" And then: ""Alright: in your seats and Let's have no more of this or you will be Sorry...""

It was always my policy that I was the Leader and that I was responsible for standing up to the obnoxious students on behalf of everyone in the class--that's what they paid me for...

Yes: you are right to be annoyed. :)"
"I work in mental health  I would never say it to a client if it wasn’t true. If a client is truly ugly and stupid, they probably know it, and I’d lose credibility if I told them they were smart and cute. Everyone has an area where they can be complimented. This just happened to be what your therapist went with. "
"Thank you, his reaction to this whole fiasco really solidified my feelings for him. Everybody likes to think that their partner will stick their neck out for them, but you never really know until the shit hits the fan!"

"I work with a guy that fit all the stereotypes of older gay man. He wears dangling earrings and has lighter colored hair. He has a second Job as a hair stylist and works in a salon, and has a couple of accessories that show that off (like scissor earrings). He speaks with clear diction and many of my coworkers (including myself) genuinely thought he was gay. He actually has a girlfriend of many years including kids. He holds a sense of pride about being perceived as a gay man and has told me that ""he is gay in every way other than in practice."" One of the nicest guys I've ever known and it really made me realize how much ""gaydars"" rely on stereotypes."

"As a fairly masc dude myself, there's literally no harm in talking to someone. I was once waiting for a train on the subway platform and noticed a cute guy. I caught his attention and told him he seemed really familiar (he said the same thing back -- very good sign). We spoke for a few minutes and by the end I had his number. You don't necessarily need to wave a flag, sometimes good old conversation is all it takes "

"Don’t take your parents’ money.
Remind your fiancée that it’s your wedding, too. Explain to him that you know he’s excited, you’re excited as well, but to spend that much is not financially responsible.
If he insists on a huge wedding then you need to open a separate, secret bank account for the day he blows all you $$ on dumb stuff."

I know plenty of gay guys that actively vote against their own self-interest.

"As a gay person from Northern Ireland that goes to Uni in England ( to be away from my parents 😂😂), I’m curious to know eh..... what community your BF comes from. As Northern Ireland is a rather complicated place with two odd cultures. 😭"
"I have a friend with benefits who I like a lot. He's cool, into cars and old radios. He's bout 8 years older than me. We text all the time. 

He always makes me feel really special, he talks about my eyes and rubs my arms.

When we chill it'll be the usual Netflix and chill recipe, some whiskey and cola. We'll usually chat and barely pay attention to the show.

Eventually he'll want to suck my dick, he's really good at it but he doesn't spend a lot of time down there. I'll suck his nuts and cock too. We're both pretty hung and we'll compliment each other. 

My favorite part: 
He'll turn me around against the wall and start licking my hole. He gets a ton of saliva on my hole. Then he'll just start fucking me. Like, he can barely help himself he says. It hurts bad (he's long af) but God damn I don't want him to stop. He always asks if I'm doing okay but I encourage him to keep it up.

He usually busts on my back or on my face, which is hot. And he'll always go round two just to get me off.

Then we cuddle for an hour, usually get horny again (lol), then he leaves. "
"I mostly top, but occasionally I will get the urge to get fucked. I get a deep urge in my ass to get fucked, similar to what you're describing (without the tingle). It's like I have a button that needs to be pressed (probably my prostate), and once it's ""hit"" I'm good. Grab a dildo and see if that gets rid of your urge!"

"I think it's easy looking at it from an outsiders perspective but more difficult when it happens to you. I mean not every sexual encounter starts with a direct request for sex followed by a direct answer. Sometimes it just builds up to it and happens. So if you're used to those types of situations, I can understand why people wonder if they were sending signals or if they are to blame for initiating a sexual interaction even if they change their mind or it goes wrong. Also I can't imagine how shocking it is to experience it. It makes sense you would question yourself."

There's a whole black mirror episode where social media basically takes over society and your whole life is governed by your social media score.  It begins with the main character taking a picture of her latte then breathing a sigh of relief as the likes roll in.  As soon as I saw it I was like damn I'm going to like this episode.

"honestly I'm black and I would of been annoyed af if I were you. I disagree and think that uf you're not giving him a reason to think that then it's unnecessary to bring that up or even ask.  thats such a turn off and really shows how fragile the persons self-image is. Especially on the first date..nah thats crazy lol But cudoos for you for having patience. 

It's interesting though, I'm seeing more and more posts about thsi..I didn't know it was this prevalent. Maybe also cuz I've yet to experience it. I honestly don't even get attention from white dudes..they never seem to be into me "
"I don't believe that all sex is or should be the same. It's amazing to have an intimate act of passion between two lovers and it's still amazing to have adventurous sex exploring the body of someone you don't even know their name. I don't believe that hookup apps have ""devalued"" sex no more than I believe a virgin is somehow morally superior than someone who has a history.

"I always find it hilarious when these instawhores post pics with dumb captions like “oops totes didn’t mean to take this pic” or “ not feeling cute today” “ ugh so faattt!” With their 6 pack out and flexing. 🤮

Or you have the insta “models” who have 5k followers and 99% of their posts are basically nudes with dumb “inspirational” quotes. Like he’s naked except for tight undies, grabbing his junk with a quote like “in this busy world we live in, you need to be the best you” etc.

"I think you should reach out to him. He is most likely feeling vulnerable and maybe a little embarrassed. He may think that you think differently (in a bad way) of him. It would probably make him feel more comfortable if you contact him first it may help put his mind at ease. 

Are you sexually attracted to men, like at all? You could very well love and care for him, and that’s great, but how can you imagine yourself having any kind of sexual contact with him? If the answer is no, you can’t imagine that realistically happening, then you shouldn’t pursue these feelings. 

Friendship love is still a thing, and it should be cherished and protected. I wouldn’t chance ruining the relationship you have now. However, if you think you may be at least a little bit attracted to him sexually, then you should absolutely give it a shot."

The question is “what proof do you have”. Why “out” someone if you can’t prove it I say. 
I occasionally get random funny thoughts while I’m having sex. Like one second I’m just thinking the dirties slutiest stuff one thinks about during sex then I suddenly remember that time I fell in middle of my university’s cafeteria and giggle a bit.
