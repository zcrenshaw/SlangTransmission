Facts.
"Now most of these straight men on those cam sites will bend over spread their butthole with their legs wide in HD knowing full well they‚Äôre doing it for another man. 

Yeah times are pretty different."
Boys are fucking stupid
"Ladyboner sub, huh?  Any others I should know about?"
Yeah! ....wait
"I saw a post from a guy who said he was straight, but was looking for a power bottom.  If you know what a power bottom is, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre straight!"
"kind of curious, if it's not what you meant, then why does your final sentence read ""I guess for gays it's all about sex after all. that's depressing.""

have you ever been in a relationship?"
Why hate it? Who cares if some random straight guy gets an ego boost from gay men finding him attractive. I don't see a victim.
"I hate that even though i know this, and my hot straight friends know that I know this about them, I still can‚Äôt resist not giving them an ego boost."
"Well, this is an ignorant post.

* there's no reason to think it's the standard.  Monogamy is the expectation and it won't change for a long time.
* What does being open have to do with finding someone to love?
* There are MANY open straight relationships.  

I won't even bother with the rest"
"Very very very few of the guys are really straight 

Source: friends own cam site and studio"
"Hold your head high and move one. There‚Äôs nothing you can do. What‚Äôs done is done.

Celebrities deal with scandal like this all of the time. People eventually forget, especially if you don‚Äôt make a deal out of it."
"You can definitely do it, but a lot of these guys particularly live for the workout."
"That's normally what it's like. Standard job, gym after, food, maybe an hour or two of something, then you're out.

It's not this glamorous life people think it is. It's really just a normal life."
Did you say actor?
"Just FYI- You aren‚Äôt asking for anything unreasonable. Drugs aren‚Äôt always the answer. But I‚Äôm going to echo what others are saying and urge you to go talk to someone because it will help you and you‚Äôre too awesome to be unhappy. 

Peace ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I‚Äôve been in an open relationship for almost two decades. 

Do you understand how insulting it is for you to insinuate that we don‚Äôt ‚Äúactually love each other‚Äù?"
"Everywhere!

"I don't appreciate slut shaming, and the trope that ""anyone with a six pack spends their entire life in the gym"" is both false and harmful. In reality, visible abs are 99% diet and people can get substantial benefits from strength training, even if they can only commit 3 times a week."
Lmfao r/MassiveCock is just gay men thirsting desperately over str8 dicks
Tip üòâ
Do women actually talk to them ever?
They're chemicals. They don't become something else when delivered in a way *you* think is bad.
...and let me suck yer D.‚Äù
"Why do we even put a label on it (relationship, friendship, fwb, relationship of convenience)

I'm not sure we would be having a conversation about this at all if we didn't label things.

I guess you just need to let people do what they want to do.

But if it makes you feel any better, I know very few open relationships that have worked better than a monogamous one."
You are confusing sex and love. Being in an open relationship does not mean you do not love your SO.
I didn't agree in a clear mind. I had been drugged.
"It‚Äôs WAY, WAAAY easier to find a bf as a woman. 

You have no idea. 

Literally ANY woman just has to open Tinder to be inundated by proposals, dates and dickpics. You don‚Äôt have to be specially beautiful, there are guys just swiping everything. 

Now, try your luck getting a boyfriend in Grindr. 


And it‚Äôs basically the same in the outside world. We have a minuscule and very selective, racist and hateful dating pool, so it‚Äôs really complicated."
God you're so bitter
Telepathy/Telekinesis (as powerful as Jean Grey)
You are a platinum star gay.
"r/MassiveCock is a good one, along with r/ThickDick and r/mangonewild all gems, all of them."
"it isn't the standard. there are also many straight open relationships, married with kids too. Swingers Clubs and ""Lifestyle Resorts"", which generally are not that friendly to gay men (or bi men... bi women tho are prized!) are doing very, very well these days, and straights were openly swinging long before we were ever able to come out of the closet. have you ever been in a relationship lasting a year or more? just curious. 

many here should not be considered a majority btw, just know that we're not remotely unique and don't assume someone else's relationship is less real because of how the participants have chosen to set it up."
"If you‚Äôre in the US, the average height is 5‚Äô9‚Äù for males."
I'm so sorry that happened - it's something I want to avoid. I hope you're doing well despite it. My family is a little broken up too so I can sympathise a bit... take care of yourself and let me know if you want to talk about anything.
"So... you're a woman who wants to become a gay man because you think the dating would be easier? Seems like a bad reason for such a drastic change even if it was true, which I really doubt"
"Well, I was eating pizza one day, double pepperoni, obvs, and the thought occured to me that I'd really fucking love a cock up my shitter. 

From that moment on the gay seeds grew and that led me to think I should become either a full time gay, or a Spice Girl. Geri had just quit but I don't have ginger hair, so I went with being a flaming homosexual. 

And that is my story of why I decided to become one of the gays."
"Appreciate the ""you can do it"" :)"
Wish I can find a man like that
"Be so difficult to have powers like that and people not notice. I mean it's cool, not very low-key though. I think i'd want to be more subtle."
"r/ladybonersgw is the only one I know of that's specifically for women but dominated by men (straight and gay lol) Maybe r/MassiveCock too.

NSFW just in case"
I didn't realize one person represented all gays.
"You know, they could be bi and in a non-mono relationship."
Bear parties let non-bears understand what being a salmon feels like.
Hmm maybe I'll give OKCupid a go!
"It makes me sad. These are clearly queer guys who have internalized toxic ""no homo"" culture and are unable to look at other men as potential romantic partners. 

As a side note, this is part of the problem of the split attraction model, it convinces lots of guys like this that they can be physically attracted to guys while maintaining emotional distance without any guilt or introspection."
Lmao such rubbish
"That's when you reverse it on him and say ""Dude, stop being such a bitch about it."""
"Yeah, some go to great mental gymnastics to think of themselves as ""straight""."
"Oh. You did good. 

Don‚Äôt be ashamed. I would feel the same way as you, but I feel proud of you since I‚Äôm not you. 

Don‚Äôt give yourself such a hard time. If this had happened to someone else, how would you feel for them? Think of it that way."
"I've been pissed on, swallowed piss, and pissed in anally.

I don't recommend putting yellow piss in your mouth because it tastes pretty foul.

Getting pissed on was actually pretty fun.

Having a guy piss in me is pretty meh."
I'm a bisexual woman and I'm subbed to both /r/ladyboners and /r/gentlemanboners. Glad those gay guys are there to admire Jason Momoa with us!
"I wouldnt say its stadard. BUT I do see where you are coming from..I made a post about the topic on fb a few weeks back, and I was surprised to see more than half of the comments were people saying they are open.
Now I dont knock anyone for doing it.
But I could never. Me and my boyfriend are on the same page, we just want eachother and nothing will change that. 
I think anyone who chooses to do it just needs to be totally open and honest. Because I can say I dont know of one single open relationship that has worked (out of people I know)...so the desire to make it work has to be there.
I think some (not all let me be clear), but SOME people who choose it are just not fit for commiting to one person...otherwise they'll cheat and continue to cheat...so they look for relationships where they can be more free...
Monogamy for life for me üëå"
Maybe you deserve better because you're 'working on yourself' too much?
Fellow programmer detected.
"The answer is different for everyone and since it is their lives (and not ours) their prerogative. For some (gay, bi, or straight) monogamy is an option, not a default.
Not a bad thing. But also not for everyone.

Don't like it? Don't have one."
That's a relief. How hella awkward would that have been? Lol
"Some people just don't believe in monogamy. That's not something that's just exclusive to gay couples. I think it might be more prominent with gay couple because it's more difficult to find a partner you love who you are also sexually compatible with. I'm happily monogamous with my BF, but respect couples who somehow make open relationships work, I could never do that."
"Yikes, never. Now I'm depressed thinking that straight guys see us like that."
"Not all of them are rich. A lot work in normal 9 to 5, or service jobs like flight attendant etc. 

And they aren‚Äôt shredded year round. A lot of them just make thousands of pics when they are in their best shape and post those pics throughout the year. And a lot are using steroids, what‚Äôs make it way easier. You can either cycle on/off or bnc, when you bnc you can attain and keep your mass with a low bodyfat as long as you are on. These are the ones who are shredded the whole time. 

I once knew a guy who was juicing, but wasn‚Äôt working out regularly but still was buff even without training for 2 months.  Or there is this famous bear guy, who is selling fitness programs on his insta. He‚Äôs only posting old pics of him when he was big, because he had to come off the juice for a knee surgery. Now he‚Äôs crying in his stories the whole time and is photoshopping his muscles because he feels fat and small. We are living in a fucked up world, so don‚Äôt believe everything you see online."
"You‚Äôre getting so many answers to that question yet still playing dumb lol.., childish"
"that lifestyle sucks you in fast, I only dipped a toe in and found myself lying half-conscious in a bath house, doped up like a race horse next to my fbuddy who just told me he's HIV+ but undetectable rawdogging some dude that walked by"
Obvious bait is obvious
"I had a surgery for them -- called a hemorrhoidectomy. Most painful experience in my life. The recovery was a bitch -- felt like i was giving birth to a baby every time I took a shit for poop the size of a pebble. Also, it left my hole so tight that I can't take the huge dicks I used to be able to without pain. 

I would recommend instead getting them rubber band ligated. I had that done and didn't experience any pain whatsoever. 

Orrr, possibly, wait for them to go away on their own. If you can deal with the underlying cause, this can be an option. 

But NEVER EVER get the surgery. Ruined my sex life."
"*Bussy*, not busy"
Will get some and already staying away
"Yeah, that even varies between neighboring countries on the same continent. Canada's laws in this regard are very different from those in the States, as an example. (Avuncular marriage may be legal there, for instance, but how it's perceived *socially* is a different matter.)"
"Also, you could end up with HIV or Herpes. I know guys who've ended up with both(not simultaneously) and now they are never going to be desired like someone who doesn't have an incurable disease. So yeah, love yourself first. Be safe and be well.

Glad I could help. People rarely listen to me."
What is your backup plan if he catfished you?
"Of course I agree with you in theory, but it also seems naive, given that there is institutional pressure to be (or appear to be) straight in many public-facing industries. 

In any case I'm not really interested in revisiting the content of that particular thread. It's just one among countless examples."
I started having sex with men.
Ah should have read your profile first. Spammer and troll. Gotcha.
I did the math so wrong. Everything is supposed to be billion. üíÄüíÄüòñ
"Yeah, we are dumb. Blame it on the two heads. Not enough blood to support them both."
Are you seeing a therapist about this issue?
lol I wish. just very good at finding out info when I want to.
Which one is he?
"Yeah if you go to /r/ladybonersgonewild , /r/AsianLadyboners it's mostly men upvoting and commenting on the posts lol"
What a biphobic cunt
This is super good advice.
That‚Äôs why I cut ties with a lot of gay people I used to hang out with. There‚Äôs this whole underworld that will happily help you completely destroy yourself. I got mixed up in that shit a couple years ago and by the end of it I felt like I was living in hell. I wish we as a community could come together and figure out how to help people who are lost like that instead of celebrating and exacerbating their self-destructive narcissism.
Post an example
"I've become more attracted to some guys the more I got to know them so that might get a spark going if the guy is into you too.  Otherwise, if you get along well, could try to be friends if it doesn't work out romantically, unless you have too many nice friends already.  Good luck!"
"straight porn is made for straight men, who want to see women get plowed. they don't want to know that the man is really there. what you're asking for likely doesn't exist in commercial form except for the site you mentioned. you might have to try sex tapes from straight couples on xtube."
"*Note

People only show the good of their life on IG

A lot of them are sex workers and probably doing sex work during these vacations too"
"Being a fetus, growing inside a woman, is when I decided. My mom to this day, 35 years later, tells the story of my near full Sprint I did out of the birthing canal. 16 minutes of labor! Yeah, fuck that swamp, put me between a man's thighs any day."
I never decided to become gay.  What makes you think it is a choice?
Not flabby but like built. He bulks in the winter then cuts for spring.
If someone notices something I'll just erase their memory of what they saw.
"You're right about that.  I do 5 hours per day, in 3 sessions, 6 days per week.  This sub is my between-sets activity.  Half of my comments are during an endorphin rush.

You're also right about the effect on free time.  I have Saturday and that's it."
Recently found that sub. I'm so happy it exists.
Link?
No? Huh. I‚Äôve heard that a lot lately.
I think the consensus is actually that you'll never find it if you're desperate.
You're definetely a bot
"Wow, you‚Äôre full on crazy"
Those are kinda sexy I used to think that the bigger the nose. The thicker the eggplant.
Yes. Why does this get asked so often?
"If it doesn't work out, just come back to before you decided ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Thanks for the honest response. Good point
"This is my choice too. It would be awesome to know what it feels like to look different and experience the world as someone else. Also, I‚Äôd gladly shapeshift into something else my husband likes to keep him satisfied.

Surprising there aren‚Äôt more on board with it on here, considering all the crap we read like ‚ÄúBF wants to open things up after 6 years,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve caught him cheating but I know he still loves me.‚Äù It‚Äôs an immediate solve."
(FYI everyone: I‚Äôm a boy)
"Where does it say in that post about them being grossed out by kissing guys? I don‚Äôt see it. 

Are there homophobic bi guys? Of course there. I can think of one who comes here. However, I honestly see more internal homophobia from gay guys on this sub than bi guys."
"I love going alone. After 2/3 drinks my mouth just starts talking to strangers. And they talk back too. I don‚Äôt always talk to people. Sometimes I‚Äôll go alone and people will approach me, but if not I don‚Äôt take it personal."
"There might be a few but, a lot is definitely not right. There's no need for gay men to jealous if trans women"
Prep won‚Äôt stop Herpes bro
I hate guys who are turned off by other guys who like to express themself in a different way (like effeminate guys)
"Great, yourself?"
"I feel really bad for you, but thanks for warning others."
"I don‚Äôt always wear my buckle haha. I‚Äôm torn. I love the country, but I enjoy big cities too. I want to travel more and explore areas. If I find somewhere that feels right then I go from there.  I enjoy places like Denver where you can still be country in a big city. I need to explore more cities like that."
Of course! Hope it helps!
Good luck buddy.  And good luck on snagging that guy when he goes to uni!
Don't worry I totally understood what you were trying to say. I think his approach has way less of a chance of going bad haha
I hook up with at least 3-5 guys a week

"The message wasn't but the tone and delivery were. He went for the tough love approach. That's usually never well received. But to defend him, if OP appears to be closeted and was around others who don't know about him like that, he should've been prepared when he gave them access to his personal stuff. Sometimes people snoop, sometimes things show up in their view at the wrong place and time. Nothing to do now, but live and learn. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
this is the worst comment i‚Äôve read all day
Piss is sterile. There's nothing you could catch that you wouldn't from blowing the guy. Stop giving false info

"Thank you, I'm flattered : )"
"Heteroromantic maybe, but at that point, definitely not straight!"
"things can get better, but you might have to really work to make it so."
That sucks but hey at least you can just move forward right? I noticed someone else was stating to ask him out on a non-date and think that would have just confused the situation. At least now you know and it could change in the future right! Onwards and upwards! üòäüòä
"That‚Äôs exactly how I‚Äôm feeling, I‚Äôd give anything just to have a quick glimpse into the future...

Thank you for your comment, I really appreciate it"
"Volunteer somewhere. 

You'll be surprised how much better it makes you feel. They definitely won't reject you and you can work yourself back to some normality from there."
Bros are best ladies
"It's not so much that,  I'm surprised this crosses so many gay dudes mind. It was never something I thought about."
find him message him! at worst he says no and you never see him for the rest of your life
"I want to be with someone that only wants to be in a relationship with me. A relationship is not about sex, it‚Äôs about love. While we enjoy sex with each other, we also enjoy sex with other people. But we are only in love with each other, supporting each other and building a life together. Monogamy just is not something we care about and don‚Äôt see how it is relevant to our relationship."
I do keep my snacks in the pantry.
"It's fine not to participate.

Everyone's struggle is different."
I'd say right about the time it starts to feel more like a chore rather than something to be enjoyed.
"I personally think an actor should be well, an actor. Not the person actually portrayed in the movie. I can understand the anger if a white guy is casted for a black character (because it's refusing to have a colored main character onscreen), but for something invisible, like sexual orientation? Doesn't really make sense to me.

&gt; There is a huge difference between a straight guy and a masculine gay guy and viewer should be able to tell the difference.

Well, that just tells something about your idea of what being gay is. As a teenager, i would have loved to have a gay character as average of the actor of *Love, Simon* to be able to identify."
"No thanks, that link will stay blue."
"As a male massage therapist, yes, I can attest to the fact that gay men can be just as creepy, handsy, and disrespectful to other men as straight men are to women. I get touched inappropriately, hit on constantly even after boundaries are laid and many assume just because I am a gay man myself that I would have no problem just jacking anyone and everyone off. And also that I surely don‚Äôt mind having my crotch grabbed during a session."
Eat a fuck ton... does he get fat though?

"""This is for all the ladies""...right"
"Had a lesbian friend who I use to be with on occasion...  This girl loved a hard pounding more than any straight woman I ever came across!  She said she had other lesbian friends who had sex with men on occasion as well.  I'm sure many gay guys would also enjoy having sex with a woman on occasion as well.  Probably a lot easier for lesbians to find male partners than the other way around, though."
Depends on the country but likely average or slightly above average.
I like forearmporn myself
"&gt;We were never talking about all gays, we were talking about Instagram influencer~~s~~. Keep digging yourself deeper.


Influencer. Singular. It's still not comparable to **putting children in concentration camps**"
"I like that, sounds similar to what we talked about. Maybe every few months unless we‚Äôre on vacation lol. 
I appreciate your input though. It has helped"
"One time, I thought that a guy messaging me was a bot so I asked him, ""You‚Äôre in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down, and you see a tortoise, crawling toward you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over, but it can‚Äôt, not without your help. But you‚Äôre not helping. Why is that?"" He turned out to be real and quite confused because he had never seen Blade Runner."

"Of course, guys are too busy looking at their own imperfections"
This Is very unlikely. I was jealous of trans women when I lived as a gay man but that's because I was repressed and I actually am a trans woman and am now transitioning. The most likely explanation Is that they are either repressed trans women or they may be jealous of the attention some of us get from straight guys (nevermind that dating as a trans person Is a fucking minefield)
"Grew up in rural Alabama. Hung out with the ‚Äúrednecks‚Äù for the most part. Spent high school going muddin and hanging out in pastures. I still live in the south and although I have a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù job now, I spend my off time wood working (ha), and doing handyman type things around my house. When I was younger, I thought I wanted to be a city boy. While I like the city just fine, I find myself longing to have a small farm type deal in the country again. Maybe one day!"
"That‚Äôs like the typical comment, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd make such the perfect husband‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôd make some girl so happy‚Äù.  Me, myself the way I am can still make the perfect husband, and I can make some guy so happy."
There isn‚Äôt an easy way to be perfectly honest
You're both the man in the relationship because you're both men.
I‚Äôm very happy and proud of you. :)
"One, it's not easy to have a year-round body like that. You're basically going to be in the gym constantly, eating clean all the time, rarely drinking or taking drugs, etc. It's a commitment, and often means you don't have time for anything else really. Those profiles where they say their activities include 'the gym' arent lying.

Two, race gets complicated at this level. Once you've hit the instabody point, it really turns into a matter of culture. You'll occasionally see a Black instagay in their groups, but it's not becuz they dont exist. It's becuz they are probably with a group of Black instagays, where there is 1 White instagay with them sometimes. If you start actually liking photos of non-White guys and allowing the algorithm to pick up that you want something other than White guys, you end up seeing this.

Lastly, your likely just looking at model instagrams. There are plenty of fit guys that are seen with non-fit guys. They just dont focus their instagram around their body. My favorite is this guy who likes circuit parties, but is an accomplished flute player, and most of his post are about instruments."

"I find awe in the universe but it's meaningless awe. it created itself and is impersonal and random. it makes me think of how ultimately small we are.

If someone could give you such a bullshit excuse of a cop-out then you probably are too good for them. It's a form of blame-shifting that puts the excuse on the other person as to why they don't wanna date anymore. Just my opinion tho.
"I do. I really appreciate movies and pieces of culture that concern the civil rights movement. I come from a country which is very, very, very monochromatic, and I too would like to know if it's suspect to find solace and strength in the experiences and lifetimes of the civil rights movement leaders, even though it was/is a fight I had very little to do with."

"Then the HR at your company is incredibly shortsighted and unlike any I‚Äôve ever seen.  At the end of the day, HR exists to protect the company.  They shut down the type of language because even if the company is right-leaning, clients might not be.  All it takes is employees being careless and allowing a client to overhear them saying the f word, the n word, or any other slur one time and they can potentially lose business and have their reputation damaged.  Any HR rep who doesn‚Äôt shut this kind of thing down isn‚Äôt doing their job and is putting the company at risk."

Yeah one of the richest ironies of r/askgaybros is that its users routinely offer the most chickenshit advice imaginable.
"HR exist to serve the companies best interest. HR will interview OP. They will ask OP how was he harassed. OP will state he over heard a word used in a conversation he was not part of. HR will ask what other types of harassment or threats has he been victim to. OP may mention he once heard the same co-worker use this word before.

Then HR will interview the guy who said the word, he will deny it and probably talk in great lengths of he has no issue with LGBTQ people. HR will interview the other man in the conversation. The other man will say he‚Äôs never heard his buddy use that horrible language and thinks the guy walks on water he‚Äôs so great.

Now in HR‚Äôs eyes OP has possibly brought up a false accusation against a coworker and may be libel to cause more issues that may reflect poorly on the business. HR doesn‚Äôt want the business that signs their paycheck to look poorly. Thus OP is a problem and disgruntled."
Then you're not a creep.  Go for it.  Plus how hard is it for one guy to ask another to go for a beer?  It's the easiest thing in the world.

"THIS!   u/NJPenPal and I usually land on opposite sides of discussions, but in this instance I completely agree.  ***Don't let other people dictate your self-worth.***

You don't have to like it about the language, and if it is intolerable, suck it up, face the offender eye to eye and ask him to knock if the fuck off!   I am not convinced that this is an effective tactic, but it is better than going to HR over a comment not aimed at you."

Of course, PrEP only stops HIV.

"See, now you've gone and made me horny."
"Just remember that wanting to and being ready to are two very different things. You‚Äôve joked about it (kind of) and downloaded the app without really talking about it. Slow down, and have a serious discussion about it when you‚Äôre not both horny. See how if and you want to proceed and proceed with caution."
"it‚Äôs monday!   it‚Äôs i don‚Äôt like anal day, again!"
Depends on who's offering. ;)
"To get over the straight crush (we've all been there) you need to focus on the aspects you hate (the toxic masculinity by the sounds of it). Not going to lie, it will harm your perception of your friendship, but it's healthier than the unrequited feelings. Talking less also helps.

I'll be honest, it took mine getting married for me to move on properly. But focusing on who you can date rather than who you can't is the healthy option. Your expectations might be lower, but at the same time that can work really work out well."

"I am a 56-year-old gay man who didn't come out until I was 35. I was married to a woman with 3 children. I know a lot about internalized homophobia.

Congratulations on your relationship! Congratulations on recognizing that your reactions are internalized homophobia! Seriously, both of those are huge deals!

Anything that prevents you from enjoying your relationship exactly like heterosexuals do is homophobia. I'm sure you know you have to be smart about public displays of affection. There are limits. You don't want to smooch your boyfriend when you're picking up cattle feed at the feed store. If you're in line at Starbucks, why not?

Your internalized homophobia is another matter. I overcame mine by pursuing several avenues of help. I got into therapy. It was enormously helpful to talk to a professional who could guide me as I came out. I also got into gay culture. I lived in a large Southern city with a big gayborhood where I spent a lot of time hanging out making friends. My friends helped so much. I cannot overstate the value of gay friends. Hanging out with them made me feel normal. I also did drag. It was so much fun to paint myself and put on a gown. It was a scream. 

Coming out to family is not a simple thing. Here again, I suggest getting the help of a therapist. Their guidance can be a lifesaver. My parents are Christian fundamentalists. They are unsupportive, but I've managed to have something of a relationship with them. It's distant, but we talk, just never about my life in detail.

Again, congratulations! It's wonderful that you've found a beau and are experiencing something so important. All the best to you."
May i gently suggest that your personality may be the problem? Do some reflective thinking on why a broad range of people arent interested.
"I remember seeing them posted here. I wasn‚Äôt impressed. Then again, overly muscular men are pretty meh to me."
"That‚Äôs perfectly normal, and I‚Äôve also been through a very similar experience. I traveled overseas a few months ago, and met up with a beautiful tall man who was exactly my type. We had sex for over two hours, most of it involving kissing an oral sex. Then came the time where I had to leave, because I was leaving the city that day, and told him he can fuck me and cum after or just cum in my mouth, and he said he didn‚Äôt want to, because he likes things taken gradually, and he didn‚Äôt like rushing through everything just to cum. I didn‚Äôt either, so I left his house without cumming. I really liked the experience, and that was hands down probably the best sex I‚Äôve ever had."

"Oh god, this went way too far. I meant to ask how I refer to my attraction on apps like Grindr and tinder. Not how I label myself. The purpose for this is to not offend trans women when I write pansexual in a profile and maybe some advice from others how to avoid fetishizing the community. Thank you all for the kind words"

"First off, congratulations with coming out of the closet. I think you‚Äôve made this decision from a healthy, necessary, and selfless place.

Next, see if your psychiatrist is willing to do a family meeting with you and your mother over the phone.

"I can understand why you want to do this but it‚Äôs not a good idea. You want to establish a connection that is transparent, however, it does
come off, at best, that you have a one dimensional personality and, at worst, like you‚Äôre hitting on them.

Unfortunately, straight people will always try and guess our sexuality. It‚Äôs fun.

Rather than letting out sexualities define us, we should strive to be individuals and connect to others based on our own unique interests as well as behaviors. If you don‚Äôt get along with someone, it isn‚Äôt worth it."
I hooked up with a guy that didn‚Äôt have any fingers on his left hand... the wildest part was that I didn‚Äôt notice it until the second time we hooked up lol
"this might be a good situation for you. Your mother is offering to pay for expert help and advice, and she's letting you choose your experts. 

She might have in mind a conversion doctor or some shit, but what you can do is see a doctor who specialises in sexual health, maybe you need some immunisations, or maybe prep is appropriate for you depending on your sex life. State ran programs for gay people to meet up and talk about their lives, if you're in America then there will be some of those services in your city. 

Just choose some health professionals who deal with gay issues in a positive manner, the kind of services that a totally pro gay parent would sign their kids up for you. You talk a lot about depression and isolation so you will benefit from this kind of thing, probably. Depending on your state they will be state health service certified too. Do your research, I bet not all state services are equal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just saw you mention California, you should have no trouble finding a lot of gay positive services that are built just for gay guys like you, and the workers there would be appalled at the idea of conversion and stuff. Your mom will be pleased as piss knowing you're getting help to protect yourself from STIs at the very least.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck."
"This is unhealthy. The entire basis as to why are so enamored by this guy is because he‚Äôs gorgeous. You don‚Äôt like him; you like the idea of him. The reason why you wanted to bring him out to the wedding was so you can prove something to onlookers.

Unfortunately, this is not going to work out.

Work on your self esteem and try to establish more meaningful connections locally.

Best of luck."
"What do you mean, I'm not hateful."
"Its probably more in the line that if youre in a interview, you nor the employeer really wants to know your sexual orientation in a professional setting. So if youre acting in the way of a cliche fem gay man they are going to notice that  more over the rest of the interview process as opposed to if you were just ""neutral"". Not sure why if you were applying to intern in a lab or any field for that matter why you would even want to 'dial it up"" that far tbh. But thats just my take on it"
"Stop listening to all the queens telling you you have internalised homophobia. It is all nothing but armchair psychology. 

Lot's of people are not comfortable with PDA. Straight or gay. I am one of them. It is not unusual or weird or anything other than you do not like PDA.

All these queens would have you running up and down the streets waving flags out of your asshole given a chance.

It is not self hate. It is simple respect for the feelings of others around you. PDA makes lots of people not comfortable. You are doing nothing wrong."
"I don't have a gay guy friend but if I do and i start falling for him, the last thing i would do is tell him. I've crushed on too many of my guy friends to know that the friendship isn't gonna end well (cause they always say no lol)"
I honestly think it's just that we tend to be more rational and can move past the internalized homophobia that keeps others fixated on their heterosexuality. Just about everyone has homosexual tendencies at varying scales. We're just able to admit it more easily.

"Preferences are preferences, even more when it comes to dating 

It is no one's business who you want to have as a partner or not."
"I think it's all down to preferences. Personally there is a 'too big' that is just not enjoyable - but this depends on the guy too. Hub is bigger than most (8.5 - seriously guys go grab yourself a tall skinny guy) and certainly bigger than what I'd normally enjoy, but he knows how I like it and takes his time."
Sf is more tech/yuppie than anything now
"I mean, don't let it bum you out. I point this out so that you have an idea of why your approach may not have had the desired effect, so you can do better next time. Yes, the way you approached this was creepy, and admitting that is important. But that doesn't mean *you're* a creep. Everyone can be a little creepy sometimes. 

The key is to remember that these are people - people with full inner lives, issues, insecurities, hobbies, problems, etc. This guy is not just some gorgeous doll, and you're not some loser who'd be lucky to spend a wedding bathing in his reflected radiance. You're both just humans. Talk to him like a fellow human. Get to know him. If he's not interesting or interest*ed*, go find someone who is."

Psychological therapy will increase the likelihood that you‚Äôll rediscover anger for your mother, but it won‚Äôt change your sexual orientation. Send your mother books to read."
"That's going to depend on exactly where he is. He needs to get connected with local gay men and learn how they manage it. Maybe he starts by finding someone who's from there, is openly gay but now lives somewhere else since that person would probably be easier to find on the internet than someone who lives there now."

Some guys can pull off scars well - especially if they are masculine
Wait I thought..
I got fucked by my straight friend once but he's still chasing pussy and now engaged to a cow :(
A quick glance through your profile shows you have a lot of self-hatred - I hope you can learn to accept yourself in the future and realise that being gay isn't something you should try and convert.
"supposedly someone did that to me, only they put my picture up and said i had aids."

"What state? And also, specifically 15+ employees in the company or fewer than 15? 

These questions matter in determining whether and what kind of employment discrimination legal protections are in effect, which you'll want to know before you make a decision on how you want to move forward.

For example, if you're in California, sexual orientation is explicitly a protected category under state employment discrimination law (Cal. Fair Employment and Housing Act) and is applicable if the company has 5+ employees.

If you're in a state that does not explicitly include sexual orientation as a protected category under state employment discrimination laws, there is federal law (Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII), but it's only applicable if your company has 15+ employees. An additional wrinkle is current uncertainty whether Title VII protects sexual orientation (thanks Trump DOJ... elections have consequences).

Regardless of how you decide to handle, document the previous conduct and start documenting future conduct contemporaneously. Include date, time, location, who was present or may have witnessed/heard, what the conduct was."

"Calm down. But remember that even cool people act like jerk sometimes when are in groups (maybe they noticed you have a crash on him and this started a joke) .
