"That's really gross. Don't worry - it's not a gay/straight issue. Just don't leave shit in the bathtub. I've lived in houses with only gay men and this is not a thing that happens. 

The problem is how to address it without your roommate being so embarrassed it causes problems or creates a weird atmosphere in the house. If it's only happened once it might just be a one off mistake, so there's no point in totally humiliating the guy. 

Maybe you could leave a note for him that says - 'Hey ****, could you clean up the bathtub please? Thanks.' And then don't mention it again unless he brings it up - hopefully to apologise. If it was a genuine mistake this might make things a little easier for both of you. 

If he doesn't clean it up or it happens again, look for another roommate! "
And why are gay films always about coming out and self discovery? Where are the gay movies where we meet a gay character in the height of their career but think it's time to look for love or all of a sudden fall in love with a handsome Italian farmer like in straight movies.
"‚Äú oh, so you two,‚Äù makes bumping hand gesture?

I laugh forcedly, ‚Äú yep‚Äù.

He stops to think for a minute. ‚ÄúBut how do you know whose underwear is whose?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing, my ex was dumbstruck.  I never got an explanation, all I could think was that he meant in the dark after sex while trying to leave. But even then."
"You sound like me 10 years ago. Just tell him how you feel 

Also, we're married now. "
"Gay tragedy is a trope because it appeals to straight audiences. They like to think of us as beautiful but doomed - the gay lifestyle is a fun escapist fantasy for straight folks, but it has to eventually make us miserable in order to make straights feel better about being so traditional.

EDIT: RIP my inbox. Didn't realise this was a controversial point of view. Regardless of your interpretation of it, [gay characters ending tragically and gay stories ending unhappily is a well-established trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays), if one that appears to be dying something of a death with recent LGBT movies.

Last night I was in a group setting and one of my friends took his shirt off while I was talking. I unconsciously stopped mid sentence and stared. Luckily they know I'm gay but the jokes won't stop. So embarrassing lol
"Why bother with a label? Just have fun, enjoy i,t and respect each other.  "
"There's no judgment in expecting a poopless bathtub. 

It sounds like he might not realize what happened. I think 99.99% of gay guys would be profoundly embarrassed to have left their tub that way, even if they lived alone.

Assuming he doesn't immediately notice and clean it in the AM, just tell him he needs to. If he reacts poorly, that's on him. It's not a defensible act."
"Surely, it was on page 69"
"I once ripped the face off a tour guide who in a quiet moment on the tour looked us up and down, then her face looks like some scientist who just realized how to cure cancer and she says ‚ÄúFather and son, yes?‚Äù

"As others have said, it may depend on how old you both are. Don't jump into sex right away. It sounds like you're very close so this seems like a conversation that might be awkward but wouldn't mess anything up in an irreparable way. Be upfront and honest with him about how you feel and where you're at--tell him how much you care about him as a person, that you'd be interested in trying something romantic, and that while you're unsure about whether it would work sexually you're willing to give it a shot.

I want to emphasize that it's important that you be honest about where you are in terms of figuring out your sexuality and how sure you are about being able to make the sex part of the relationship work, because you don't want to lead him on. That will just result in both of you being hurt and will mess up the relationship more than being open about this or giving it a genuine shot.

If you are serious about giving the sex part of the relationship a shot, you also need to talk about what that would entail. First, what do you want or expect sexually? Do you want him to give you head, bottom for you, etc.? Be aware that not all gay guys like giving head, not all gay guys enjoy bottoming or are willing to bottom. Find out if he would enjoy what you would want. Second, what would you be willing to do for him? Would you be willing to reciprocate oral sex? Would you be willing to bottom? What would you do to get him off? Reciprocity in sexual relationships, particularly in a romantic context, is vital. Think carefully about whether you'd be able to reciprocate. If you aren't able and willing to do it, with enthusiasm, then be open about that.

Also be aware of the position your friend is in. He has a crush on you and clearly cares about you a lot. Straight guys sometimes--without any ill intent--take advantage of their gay friends in that position when they want to get off. If this isn't reciprocal, the gay friend might agree to it because he has feelings for you or finds  you hot, but later will probably feel sad about it and used. That's why it's important to be upfront with him, to consider whether and how you'd be able to reciprocate, and be realistic and serious about entering into anything beyond platonic friendship with him.

I hope this is helpful. Feel free to reply or PM with any questions. I wish you both the best of luck. Please update us!"

That's a tough one. If it would cause a big scene then I think bringing you to a wedding is not the right way to come out. You definitely dont want to be known as the guy that ruined a wedding.  It does however highlight the situation.  Make your feelings about feeling left out clear to him and see if he would be willing to schedule a quiet dinner with his parents which would be a more appropriate place to come out. That way if it goes badly it's not a public spectical and the family doesn't feel as put on the spot. Coming out is also a very personal thing and each person has to decide for themselves. I understand your wanting to be part of all parts of his life but it's not a decision you can force for him. All you can really do is share your feeling and work through them together.

"When I first made NCO in the military I had to stop ""fraternizing"" with the enlisted ranks.  It was a transition to being with the other NCOs.  Right of the top an older NCO who became a mentor to me took me to lunch in the base chow hall.  He told me to look out across the chow hall and to note all the men who crossed their legs back under their seats.  He then said, ""99 out of a hundred of those men are gay"".

I immediately looked down and noticed that my legs were crossed that way.  When I looked up he was giving me a very knowing and discerning smile right into my eyes.  Over the next few years I'll be damned if his comment didn't turn out to be true.  At least at time, with that generation, the boys who crossed the legs back under their seat were almost always gay in the end.  "

"That would probably be my brother commenting on the fact that my first boyfriend in high school would come over and help me at work (family agricultural business) just so we could have some time together outside school. (Normally, what was expected of me was intended to keep me busy from predawn to dusk, even on weekends.) The fact that girlfriends don't do things like that was something he remarked on a few times in a way which was vaguely but humorously envious."
"&gt; The problem is how to address it without your roommate being so embarrassed it causes problems or creates a weird atmosphere in the house. If it's only happened once it might just be a one off mistake, so there's no point in totally humiliating the guy.

This is so correct. Reddit's advice in these situations is almost always to overreact and if this were a relationship I would bet that the majority opinion would be something like ""it only will get worse from here, leave him*."" From the couple sentences in OP it really does seem like a mortifying mistake by OP's roommate. Folks, people make mistakes when they're living with other people (even when they're not!). Some mistakes are bigger than others. This does NOT give you carte blanche to get judgmental and self-righteous; only do that if you want to guarantee that life going forward will be awkward, stunted, and ultimately untenable. 

Having said that, this:

&gt;Maybe you could leave a note for him

sounds very passive aggressive and a strategy of someone who really wants to avoid the situation as much as possible. I get it, I think everyone in similar circumstances would much rather leave a note for the offending party rather than just straight-up talk to him, but I really think in this case that OP should just do the latter. Don't 'confront' him OP, be tactful, and try to frame this in such a way that it's something you can both laugh over in a couple months.

*Obviously the analogy doesn't account for cheating."

Am I going to look like Tom Hanks in Philadelphia? My parents are Christian and if I go to the doctor I am on their insurance and they will find out not only am I gay but I also am dying of Aids, how do I tell them? 

I am also in love with my best friend who is a straight guy and I am heartbroken because he started dating a female and is spending more time with her than he is me, his Gay friend who is probably dying of AIDS.  What is wrong with him? How can I get him to dump her and switch from her vagina to my hairy HIV Positive anus?

"You *really do* only live once.

Don't miss out on life. Do what makes you feel good, and don't worry about reductive labels."
Humans are social creatures. Being alone used to be detrimental to our survival and procreation. Feeling content or even happy with being lonely is not normal. Craving social interactions and relationships is normal and this bullshit that you need to be happy with being lonely before you can have any friendship or romantic relationship needs to go away. You shouldn't hate yourself because that puts an immense strain on your SO and on the relationship but self-confidence/love and loneliness are completely different things.
Is it an insult? It sounds more like a hungry yearning

I think it's likely that movies like this will become more prevalent as gays (hopefully) become more accepted in the mainstream culture. The coming out narrative will get played and coming out will likely not be as difficult a thing for young people as gays become more normalized. Probably will begin to see more movies about gays as normal flawed human beings like the one you're talking about.

"Hard no. You haven't mentioned romance so I'm assuming this isn't about being single. If you're feeling lonely, you're not getting something you want/need for your happiness. There's a difference between loving yourself, being content on your own and being lonely.

You might very well never feel a connection like that with a guy again and live forever as a straight guy.

"First of all the public ask which the kids seem to be so fond of lately is really shitty.  It puts someone in an awkward situation and essentially takes away their agency....they have to say yes or risk being branded an asshole.  It‚Äôs manipulative and selfish to do that to someone in hopes of going viral. 

This is even worse.  Making a straight guy feel he has to go to a dance with his gay friend is bizarre.  Not only is he surely subjecting his friend to a fair amount of bullying/harassment, but it is just weird.  He is straight!  Why would he want to go on a date with a gay man?  That is not allyship. I have zero interest in going on a date with women.  I‚Äôm sure his friend feels the same about him.

"You're right for most of it except:

&gt;You should get tested at least ever 90 days. If not fewer depending upon your activity and your partners.

Typical recommendations for testing are once a year, increasing in frequency up to every 3 months depending on your sexual activity/risk level. For most gay men, recommendations are every 3 to 6 months.

Testing more than once every 3 months is excessive because 

* incubation periods (especially for HIV) makes it inefficient to test that often
* the incremental gain is less likely to make an impact vs the costs it has on healthcare systems

Unless you explicitly know you've been exposed to an STI or have symptoms, testing every 3 months is sufficient.

At the same time, even if you're in a monogamous relationship you should get tested at least once annually (and within  6 months of starting your new relationship).

My ex best friend and I were in love (at least he swore he loved me) but he couldn't be gay or be with me because of his religious family. We had a nasty falling out. I still wonder what could have been, but life is too short for what ifs man."
"Treat him the same as you always did, and just be there for him if he needs support. Protection etc. is still relevant for the sex talk."

"Don't beat yourself up about it. It's a hard thing to discuss, even (or maybe especially) with someone you care so much about. I have sometimes found that it is harder to talk to someone in person about difficult issues rather than via text message. Maybe it will be easier for you to do that too. It will give you the chance to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it.

I will also add that even if you don't have the courage to be in a gay relationship or deal with what others think, you might still want to talk to your friend about it. As I said in your last post, openness and honesty is important, and that is no less true with friendships. Even if you don't experiment with him or date him, he's a gay guy and has dealt with having to struggle with his own sexuality. He will be able to empathize with what you're going through and be there to support you through it.

I speak from personal experience when I say that keeping something like this bottled up is not good for you. Staying in the closet made me very depressed. Even after telling just one person, I felt a wave of relief to finally be able to talk to someone about it. I'm not saying that it is the same for you, or that you need to ""come out,"" but I do think that you will gain a lot from not trying to hide what you're going through.

Finally, I encourage you re-think whether you have the courage to be in a same-sex relationship. You don't need to identify as gay or even as bi. You can say that you're heteroflexible or that you're straight but have one exception. Moreover, people have become far more accepting and understanding of same-sex relationships and the spectrum of sexuality in recent years. I don't know where you live or how old you are; these things vary significantly by place and age group. But think about it. I don't remember where I read it, but someone once said that as we get older we regret the chances we didn't take more than the chances we did take, even if they didn't turn out for the best. Take the chance; you'll learn a lot about yourself in the process.

Regardless, I'm still rooting for you."
"""What the fuck is that?!?"" Was said by parent who stood with his boy scout selling popcorn in front of a gas station store. It was directed at me, most likely, as me and my partner stepped out of our vehicle, yesterday. I had shoulder length hair and plain, everyday clothes on my black skin."

"This was so absolutely uplifting to read, especially after the bad day i've been having and the poor mental health i've been going through lately. Sometimes i really want to break down and cry because part of me thinks I'm invading a space I don't belong in (ie: gay spaces). I'm a gay man, in a relationship with a gay man, am part of the bear community and have a small bear flag i take to pride with me, but part of me still feels like I don't belong. 

This really really...helped. a Lot. Thank you so much. Right now, I'm happy to be me."

"That happened to me once. I was 16 in the store with my mother who said I had to stay by the cart. This woman comes by and says, ""Sir, you need to watch your daughter. She's running around and you're not being a good parent."" The look on her face when I shouted, ""Mom come help me. This woman is making me uncomfortable!"" 

My mother came over and was all angry and started saying to the woman, ""What did my son do! What did he do! I told him to stay by the cart and be quiet! Did you do something to this poor woman? I'm going to kill him!""

The look on that woman's face is one I'll never forget. "

"My bf of 4 years bought me a 4ft teddy bear from ToysRUs. I thought it was cute. But over time, he kept cuddling with it at night and I got less and less time with the bear.

One night I went to sleep while holding Teddy, and he was holding me. I was dozing off when I felt my bf wiggle Teddy out from my arms, turned over to the other side of the bed. I woke up and he was still asleep holding Teddy. 

I later told him that I was awake when he took Teddy and his face turned white. After talking for a bit, Teddy is no longer mine anymore lol."

It does pretty sure this is just gay fan fiction.

There‚Äôs only one logical conclusion. Tops don‚Äôt use Reddit. /s
[deleted]
Probably because being straight doesn‚Äôt come with a ‚Äúlook‚Äù whereas being gay is associated with being flamboyant. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being flamboyant at all but to tell a gay guy that he looks straight is like saying he‚Äôs not a stereotypical gay and that he is showing there‚Äôs more to him than his sexuality. I myself kinda wish I looked gay but whatever 
"Ugh my broworker does this all the time and I swear he knows it flusters me cause I try hard to avoid staring. He‚Äôs a fit dude and so I see glimpses of his abs and that fckn v happening... I‚Äôve yet to see an underwear band and his pants aren‚Äôt that tight on the waist. 

He‚Äôs terrible."

I have no gaydar and can't tell when someone is flirting with me either. I'm oblivious.
"I was walking downtown in my city and waiting at a crosswalk, standing beside a guy not much older than me. I had a feeling he was going to say something and sure enough he turned to me and said ""I don't mean to be creepy but you're one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen."" It was so innocent, and felt so surreal. That was like six years ago but It still crosses my mind often..."
"Proceed with caution my friend.  Many of these tells are only valid to a given generation, and caused by environmental factors of their time, and not inherent to the human condition.

Perhaps you might want to seek romantic or sexual involvements away from where you earn your living?  Gosh, the careers I have seen disrupted in my friends lives, because they couldn't resist the forbidden fruit of the work place."
"I love ass.  Love it just as much as the next guy.

"I would have completely rolled with it. ""Oh sorry, I got distracted for a second. Wink."". I find saying ""wink"" helps. :)"
"Seconded! All those things you hear people say about you not being the person you believe you are or you being confused are wrong, and the people who say it are wrong and don't understand. Just be sure you are kind to yourself and others and you are honest with yourself, and if you do those then you're doing everything right. "
Hehe... receiving institution.
"No.  Don't corner other people like that.  He might not be out at work.  Keep the discussion about ""gays"" to yourself and your friends and mention other gay people you know, never put the spotlight on someone like that you don't know his situation or if he might feel threatened at work or if he's even gay!  

If he's using he word partner and avoiding pronouns there's a reason, even if he's just not sure you're ok with it."
Thank you.
So which one of you is the husband and which one of you is the wife?

"As an 18 year old myself, you don‚Äôt know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about. 

Elio is always the one who pursues Oliver, even when Oliver says they shouldn‚Äôt. There is no kind of power imbalance. There is no exploitation either - Elio has an amazing relationship with his father, and if at anytime he felt uncomfortable, all he‚Äôd have to do is say no and Oliver would back right off.

My own mother put it best. When I was 17 and unsure if I should go out with someone older than me, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you were with a mature 24 year old than an immature 17 year old‚Äù.  And 7 years is hardly a weird age difference, unless it was with like a 14 year old or something. Many couples I know, gay and straight, have the same or larger age differences, and it‚Äôs not weird at all."

"I had a crush on this one guy years ago. Finally after months of flirting he asked me to come to his place to watch reality TV (his one flaw was his love for trashy reality tv...).

I thought FINALLY, I can make my move and get this guy to bang me.

So long story short we end up in bed together. But we ended up just cuddling. I got to spend the night. He was the big spoon, and ya, sex would've been nice, but the way he pressed his nose against the back of my neck was by far one of the greatest feelings ever.

Ya we hooked up a few times after that and it was great... unfortunately we were both in two different pages in life.

He will always be the one that got away..."

"For the straights who dont get it I explain it this way. So consider the following as if you were straight. 
The odds of somebody being gay is about the same as if they had red hair. Now think about how many people you know who have red hair and are the gender you are looking for. Not so easy right? Well it gets worse. What if you lived in a world where it was shameful to have red hair so most red heads dye their hair.  Now try and find a mate from that group of people. Oh and remember you dont get to just choose one they also have to like you back. 

Thats Why its difficult. "

"&gt;In all honesty, I find them sexy although I can't really pinpoint why even if there doesn't need to be a reason for this attraction

I think part of it has to do with a subtle perception of bi guys unique masculinity.  The fact that they are sexually attracted to and maybe fuck women kinda has a subtle effect on how we see them as men.   It doesn't really have to make sense."

They're horny and want action. Beware.
