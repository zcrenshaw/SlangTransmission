"You do realize that not all old men are gross and spend their time creeping on young guys, right? That’s just a small minority. Older guys do fine, and I’m not concerned about that."
So wait me and y boyfriend can get a boyfriend and a dog Jesus why didn’t I know this sooner
Cry.
"as an ""old"" I often find those threads entertaining, because I'm not particularly into young guys, especially younger than 26, but damn if they aren't the ones pursuing me on the apps with considerable persistence. 

so think about that. when you get old, you may end up with more twinks than you know what to do with!"
"yet another ""I alone can do it"" strongman.

can't wait to see how he pulls off a better Brexit deal than May negotiated with the EU."
Having a huge number of girl friends and having my guy friends call me a “player” lmao only if they knew
Get bullied
"So true. A lot of guys seem to have standards for who they'll date or how they want a date to treat them, yet they don't even met their own standards."
It drives me insane because these are like obviously very fit and muscular guys who just ate lunch and aren't currently oiled up and flexing. If they have dadbods then no dad has ever actually had a dad bod.
"In a nutshell, you only get out of dating what you put into it. If you're not prepared to make the effort, then prepare to be disappointed!"
I don't get it. He has thousands of Instagram pictures where he looks richer than me. Why does he need a gofundme campaign exactly? Pool parties and expensive clothes tell me otherwise.
"Me and my husband always reference this video when we see exactly that. 

https://youtu.be/5ay3wex7g3A"
"My friend saw him cycling towards him and half heartedly booed him, he got annoyed and said “you could at least put some effort into it” so my friend booed him louder and he said “much better”."
"I'm legitimately concerned about the rise of authoritarians. There are too many stupid people in the world who want easy answers to nuanced problems. In the past they just stayed out of complex politics, but strongmen like Johnso  and Trump are appealing to the uneducated who don't know enough to realize how complex the world is, and who distrust intelligence and education.

There's nothing inherently wrong with being anti-establishment. It's the combination of anti-establishment and anti-intellectualism that's so dangerous. It makes people vulnerable to mass manipulation and scapegoating."
"This exactly. I'm nearly 40, and I'm well aware that if I start unrelentingly pursuing the 18-25 crowd, then I'll be one of them. But I don't - I enjoy seeing cute younger guys, but I'm not gonna hit on them."
I too have gone to the sauna/bathhouse to enjoy the jacuzzi and the steam room etc. It's also a cheap place to take a nap during the day when visiting a city. But if you want action you have to go in the wee hours on a weekend when the clubs are closing and the old men are asleep.
Yes! Be the guy you want to date!
"It’s because of your username, “SlutDaddy69.”"
"Getting old doesn’t mean your have to get fat, nor does it mean you be alone and relying on Grindr for hookups. I’m older, and neither gay, nor single. Life is great at 54."
"Shamefully calling someone at school gay even though I myself was a repressed, closeted guy myself. I can remember I upset him. :("
If you are on dating apps come off right now. Install an app called Meetup and go and meet people and make some friends. Love will happen when you least expect it. But you must learn to love yourself before anyone else can love you.
"if everybody who complains about Grindr all gave just 5 bucks.... 

your friend would be free 

&amp;#x200B;

best of luck

thanks for posting"
"Ever go on a date and the guy keeps going on his phone?

That's the worst. lol"
"The guy says he is targeting Netherlands and Germany, you should tell him that if he speaks French France is a good alternative, especially if he immigrates as a student, as Algerians have 'simplified' immigration processes and visa requirements (as a former colony). France isn't perfect but it's totally fine to be gay here."
"Right, but if you end up separating the dog gets your TV."
"There isn’t a lot of advice I can personally give. But what I can say is that your friend might’ve been through something similar, talk to him, be open about everything and see what he has to say. If he is open to you experimenting then go further. Just be completely honest with him and see what happens!"
"Thisss !!! I am from Tunisia , Algeria's neighbour, and I assure you that someone like this is very likely to have  a non homophobic family , rich parents that can afford more than his whole studies and life abroad, that has relatives abroad he can stay with whenever he wishes, that probably travels abroad three times a year and has fun with guys as much as he can . 

Don't buy into this bullshit , there are a lot of guys like me that have it way worse than him and that are living in poverty , fear and denial . If you want to really help fellow bros in homophobic mislim countries donate to associations  here working to reduce discrimination and provide refuge for people in danger. If you want I can look up links for you ."
You're 17.... your hormones have been doused with gasoline and set on fire.  That's why!
I guess I’ll have to date men of my own age!! Oooh the indignity!
How do you hold your phone gayly?
"The secret of Grindr is that it isn't a hookup app, it's a validation engine. At least half of the guys on Grindr would rather get the brief high of feeling sexually attractive enough to hook up, than actually hook up."
"Move to Austin. Disgustingly beautiful people, tatted up, running with their disgustingly cute dogs. You’d never get anything done."
"This right here I think is the reason he's so popular. Imagine telling this little anecdote across pubs in Britain. You can picture so many people going ""I don't like the guy but that's funny, he's a good laugh!""

It's that carefully cultivated image of the ""everyman"", who's relatable and a bit of a buffoon. Even then I found myself thinking along similar ish lines, despite the fact that I loathe the man. A broad swathe of the country/party think they could grab a beer with him, and that he's ""real"". Policies be damned. And of course the other swathe of the populace are rich banker twats who here tax cuts and breaks and flock to his banner.

Johnson is insidious."
"Scam. 

OP will split proceeds with ""friend"" after GoFundMe account fills up.

Via his Instagram, he's better dressed than I am and seems to be doing just fine hanging at the pool.

This is not somebody who's dealing with a life threatening situation.

Don't fall for this."
neither of them are unfit or fat. I've found the whole thing a bit hilarious.
Lol he’s Britain’s first non white  prime minister (Turkish family)😂😂😂
So you’re a bottom with a great butt looking for a top with a big dick?
"He won't even get to renegotiate another deal. It will be exactly the same as with May, where the PM can't command a majority and we're at a gridlock."

"Your post made me sad. My family was accepting, but I dont take that for granted and know there are many like you out there. I hope you can still manage to live your life to the fullest, and know we are thinking of you."

I'm shitting my pants just thinking about having that conversation. I don't know if I'm more scared of being turned down or of not being turned down. I guess I do need to just do it and see what happens... Thanks
Stole bixers from guys in locker room to sniff and jerk off... Oh and suck cock... Thats pretty gay
"Fewer health expense issues, less religious issues, fewer legal issues, better education - none if this is a judgement.

US guys - we have our problems here in the UK but they don't feel as bad when I read your posts. Feel bad for you sometimes *hugs*"
"so I get the other stuff, and yes every other app has the same feature, but this whole ""my self-esteem is going to be ruined!"" is indicative of something else. I feel if someone viewing you and not saying hi is going to wreck your self esteem, perhaps you shouldn't take the app so seriously."
Feel uncomfortable in the locker room
"Also be prepared to be disappointed even if you do make the effort.

"I loathe the man but he's voted pretty consistently in favour of LGBT rights since those comments were made, so that's one thing I'm not really worried about."
Put effort into bettering myself?? But that takes time and Reddit is easier!
"Literally, the worst. I’m not sure if you’re texting or checking your Grindr/tinder messages, but it kills me a little inside."
"As a 50 year old the notion of dating someone around the age of anything less than 35 fills me with dread.

Young people are clueless about the world. Young people have very little to actually say conversation wise that I have any interest in what so ever.

I never got the obsession with the young. Young is great when your young and mentally at the same level with similiar interests and points of reference. But when you get older your so different to how you were when you were young. I want someone I can not only fuck but have a meaningful conversation with as well. I often find the mind much more a source of attraction than physicality."
"I am sorry I cannot do much more to help, but try here [https://www.rainbowrailroad.com/gethelp](https://www.rainbowrailroad.com/gethelp)

"Oh god you just reminded me of this time... 

I’d been seeing this guy semi-long distance, when suddenly my brother had passed away, so I flew to the funeral and back. He drove into town to come spend time with me. We didn’t know each other well, we’d only just started seeing each other. We were lying in bed...I’m faced away from him, just totally overwhelmed with everything. 

I roll over, and he’s talking to some guy on Scruff. I’m like...dude...we’re not exclusive obviously, but there’s a time and a place to do that. What the fuck... 

I asked him to leave my apartment and he called me a dick, then said, “If this is how you treat people, it’s no wonder bad things keep happening to you.” 

I was shaking. I said, “Okay. you need to leave. Right now.” 

Some fuckin’ people, I swear to god...."
One had the audacity to go on his Tinder account while sitting next to me. That was so awkward.
"The fem-masc obsession is something that I've rarely found irl (some degree of it in apps tbh, but not much), but I don't know if it's an american thing or just a ""this sub"" thing. 

Also: the apparent focus on status and salary/earnings when looking for a partner and all the issues around religion that american guys seem to face either directly or indirectly (through religious parents and/or communities)"
"He is going to be both an embarrassment to himself and to the party. He likes to have others do the work for him. He's lazy. Thankfully, Britain's parliamentary democracy makes it impossible for him not to compromise."
I’m on Grindr but I’m just looking for attention tbh.
you'd be surprised at how many fat old ugly men have 20somethings chasing them. they wouldn't message y'all if they didn't have success.
"All true! I quit years ago - it stinks, costs money and will kill you. It literally has no upside."
oh and that of course💀
Having Turkish ancestors doesn't mean he's not white.
"For me, I think the issue is half-dating, i.e. dating someone while talking to other guys. I feel like many in the community have unrealistic standard. When they meet someone they like, they decide to date them, but still talk to other guys just in case they find someone better."
Man I’m a 6 foot construction worker and 98% of my underwear is what you’ve described. I don’t think it’s a problem and to hell with anyone that thinks they have the right to judge

"You might not be gay per se, sexuality is weird so don’t overthink it. Tell him you like him (I’m pretty sure he knows after that kiss) and take it from there. If he’s not feeling it, he’ll still be your best friend. 

You don’t need to worry about it. If you can just talk through it with him and take it from there. You don’t even have to think about sex yet. You just know how you feel about him and hopefully he feels the same and you can deal with the sex and your family and other worries if or when your get there. 

Enjoy the feeling and make it apparent how you feel about him."
I'm 27. When does it end?
"But don't you think some people are genuinely open to both dating and hookups? I don't think those goals are mutually exclusive. Being single sucks there's nothing wrong with a slump buster. And dating is nice too, but that's not always the situation we find ourselves in now is it"
"I wouldn’t be scared of anything, if my straight best friend came to me questioning his sexuality. I would 100% help him if I was attracted to him or not. 

But the fact that he re-engaged the kiss makes me think there might be something there. You got this! Trust your friend and lean on him for support! And then when you two are dating post a cute picture ❤️"
Okay but that's not fair either. I'm a young dude and I like to date older guys. You cant say that they're into younger guys because they've failed at life...
"I'm so sorry. My parents are bombarding me with gay conversion therapy ""literature"" and all kinds of ""being gay is a sin"" crap at the moment so I know how you feel."
"Sorry, but I’m going to go out on a limb and one-up you here.  I live in Honolulu, and I go walking a couple miles along one of our beach parks every few evenings.  You think joggers are hot?  Try surfer dudes with ripped bodies all changing at their cars in nothing but a towel, along the sidewalk... just praying that towel falls!  Even better, there’s also open air showers along the walk where people rinse off sand and saltwater.  Last night, one of the most god-like men was rinsing his surfboard in one, then set it down to rinse himself.  It was literally the hottest thing I think I’ve ever seen.  I could just imagine him naked in the shower at home.  Of course I don’t stare, but I’d be a blind fool to not glance.  And since the temperature is the same here, year round, there’s never a shortage of eye-candy."
"Nick Jonas is my favourite body type. He's clearly muscular and seems like he's chill with his body. There's a fact that building more muscle requires a lot of energy. Protein too, but can't really build anything if you don't eat enough. He may be bulking for all we know"
Avoid dating or looking queer to stay safe in high school.
"Lol. Good tip. I think I’m good for now. Before I do that, I’d like to work on getting a few regular FWB’s going."
"People underestimate how much angles and lighting can play a role in how muscular someone looks.  If they turned the right way, or the sun hit them at the right angle, I am sure they would go right back to looking ripped."
"I'm 57, not fat and not ugly. I don't use your stupid apps and I have zero interest in young men. I get plenty of attention from hot mature men.

And if I say hi to you at the bar, twink, I'm just being friendly. Don't flatter yourself."
"I fantasize about falling asleep immediately after.

Then waking up with a coffee beside me.

I'm really wild like that."
He's way too hot and hypnotized by beige buildings everywhere to know that he's suffering

"If memory serves, when I was about that age, my hormones went haywire all the time.  It is possible that you are going through a period when your Testosterone levels are fluctuating.  It could also be that you are 17.  Relish these feelings (you may or may not have them your whole life) and also do your best to live your authentic life and don’t let your hormones get the best of you."
Not everyone ages the same way you did.
Fair to say the boyfriend's getting split in more ways than one  👉😎👉
I'd argue than anti-intellectualism is dangerous on its own. The concept of completely discounting someone's input on a subject specifically because they are qualified is ridiculous to me.
"Same has happened to me, after dinner, after I paid for the food, and the guy was like...”oh, well, this was just a friend thing, tonight.” Literally wanted to smack his phone out of his hands."
Douching obsession is weird too.
Who upvotes this? That is some creepy incel shit.

"my boyfriend has scars all over his face and body, gnarly ones too. he’s also very lanky. but i think he’s the most perfect person in the world, and his entire appearance is sexy as fuck to me.

there’s definitely a person out there for you, so i wouldn’t give up just yet. it’s going to be more difficult, especially because a lot of people are shallow as hell, but you’re also not going to be “disfigured” in a lot of people’s eyes."
"They did. I had the same guy reach for my crotch 3 times! You'd think he'd understand I wasn't interested after I swapped his hand away the first time, but no. Thankfully, I was forewarned by a more experienced friend about these type of incidents so it didn't catch me entirely by surprise."

"Not a sad rant at all. It's better to get these things out in the open. This is a healing process, the first step. 

I can say that there will be others. In your journey, this was the first of many relationships. Some will end, others develop into best friends, and one will set your shorts on 🔥.

So don't worry, remember and cherish those great times you both had, and look forward to the next cute one.

All the best. IMHO."
"Yes, there are lots of people who are faithful and into monogamy. I myself have been with the same person for over 10 years.

Also, people can hookup (while not in a relationship) and also be into staying faithful if they're in a committed relationship. Those two things are not mutually exclusive."
"...You had an exciting first date and freaked out. It happens. I know it probably feels like you squandered the love of your life, but it really was just a first date. You had a connection, and it sucks that you blew it, but it was just a connection. There will be more, if M doesn't come around.

That said, get a handle on the melodrama here. I know in 2019 it's romantic to imagine yourself as this traumatised soul who couldn't possibly love, but it really isn't that hard. We've all been closeted, we've all been around people who don't get it, but ultimately the responsibility is on us to get over it and move on. You misjudged your brother. You fucked up a first date. All that this means is that you're human like the rest of us. 

Apologise to M for freaking out, respect his silence if he doesn't reply, and do better next time. That's all you can do. In the meantime, if someone seems like they want to date you, assume that they know the risks of a relationship and are willing to take them on. The impulse to not date someone to ""avoid hurting them"" is usually just poorly-disguised fear on your part."
I struggle with body image. I don't feel comfortable being shirtless at the gay beach and I have never been to a bathhouse even though I totally could. I am self-conscious about feeling ugly and undesirable.

"Yeah, I did a bit of googling and I haven't really found any ""labels"" that would work for me. It's usually just ""straight except..."". I can't see myself ever being with a guy that isn't him.

I'm sure you're right about him probably knowing how I feel after that kiss, but he didn't say anything. He just smiled and we continued talking about random stuff the rest of the night. I wish he would have said something or asked more about why I did it, maybe I'd have the guts to admit it."

"I’m not sure if this counts (happened right at 18 first few weeks of college) but ruined many of my friendships when I was forced out by a my gay neighbor in my dorm. I asked to talk because I never met anyone else who was gay before, instead he drunk, gossiped to some people, they knew people from my hometown, and it spreading like wildfire. All happened in the first few weeks of college but I didn’t know until maybe a month after when a lot of my friends list turned up ghosts- which made it even harder to figure out why. 

Sorry to make this a pitty party but gayest thing I ever did for sure. I’m over it. 

Second gayest would be finally taking he knot on my medium bad dragon after a month of practice which was also pretty fun."
Thank you. I don't buy it one fucking bit lmao. Has 7k instagram followers and thinks his life is worth 6k while there are ppl doing much worse than him.
The men's underwear section of the store was my favorite as a kid. That was a good clue. Followed up by not ever being attracted to girls when all my friends started to notice them. I wanted to know what their dicks looked like
Boxer briefs in general tbh.
Good boy. I love taking my good boy for walks. Except for the fact that I have to vacuum my house every other day during shedding season
"Everyone's saying basically the same thing, and they're right--but I'll tell you, too. My husband is exactly like you: otherwise basically straight as an arrow, but stumbled onto what is apparently the first exception to that in his life.

Don't let labels define you. You kissed your friend; you liked it and apparently so did he. Where to go from now? Wherever this leads.

Maybe you really did find your true love right at 18, and you'll be together forever. Maybe your sexuality is more fluid than you thought, and you're some degree of bisexual and just realizing it. Maybe you're pretty much straight and this is a kink you're discovering, and there's no long-term potential here. You can't know until you see where this goes, so don't be afraid to. 

You're 18. You're in the middle of a period of significant change in your life. This could be a permanent thing, or just a quirk of hormones and will be over with soon. The only thing that anyone can tell you is this: whatever it is, *it's not a bad thing.* So don't be afraid of it."
Enjoy being 17. You have so much time for so many things. You really want dick right now. It's not permanent. Just enjoy feeling like this. Someday you will be old and will want to remember this feeling. LIve it up while you can.
"Straight crush which led me to have a stoner phase since I wanted to be close to him

I guess doing something like that because you like someone is a typical teenager thing, too bad it had to come with the heartbreak of incompatibility

"I actually like nutty Boris on some things. 

That said, whoever the PM would've been, they would've been elected to do one thing and that's handle brexit. Boris has said he's willing to do a no deal brexit. That's fucking insane, and so are the torries for fucking their country with this geriatric economic policy that seems to be lost in the dream that Britannia is still an economic powerhouse. 

Oh, also a no deal brexit would place a border in Ireland, something that is universally agreed will lead to people getting shot in the kidney. 

We talk about how dysfunctional the US is, and we are, but idk if I've ever seen a modern day, first world country so hell bent on fucking themselves over for almost no reason whatsoever."
Yeah you don't have to shit on younger people to make the point about age differences. I think it's enough to say that a 20 and a 35+ year old are typically going to be in different headspaces or want different things and that's ok.
"Yeah, the Vice President of the EU made a press statement after Johnson was announced as PM, that there were not going to be anymore negotiations with the new PM."

By default, he’s usually not knocking it out of the park with guys his own age.  It’s just a strange class of guy who gets into that scene.  IOW, he seems creepy because *he is creepy*."

It's ironic you say young people are clueless about the world (as if you know so much about it), but you don't know enough to be respectful."
I hear you :D
"Then you're not being a Prince Charming. Don't expect your boyfriend to be one either. When you set your eyes on a guy and become his boyfriend, your energy and efforts should be on making the relationship work, not thinking that you've ""settled for less."""
"As the only young guy there, did they stare a lot?"
"Man, whatta _cool fag_"
"Finding a label is a pretty low priority. You love who you love. If you end up with this guy forever everyone is going to assume you're gay even if he's the only man you're ever attracted to, but it doesn't matter what they think. Bisexual or heterofexible might fit somewhat but it's not important.  I thought I was straight when I was young and then bisexual before discovering I was gay. You might discover more still. Its amazing how difficult knowing yourself can be sometimes."
"Oh- everyone talk about me in gay clubs. 

""Whose that dirty old man who dares to come here?"" I'm 48.."
I used to love being home alone for the sole purpose that I could cry without anyone asking why lmao.
"Literally who cares ? All three of them are straight, married, rich and don't GAF about what the social media crazies think . And why should they ?"
"My boyfriend is trying to quit smoking and for the most part has been doing a good job at abstaining and just vaping. However, I can ALWAYS tell whenever he decides to cheat and have one because the smell lingers on him the entire day."
"Enjoying sexy underwear does not make you “fem,” I think you just dated an asshole (struggling with self-hatred, perhaps?). Sorry that happened, bro, that shit sucks."
"Nah it's a question of probability. The more you date and the 'better' you express/ behave yourself the more likely you will find a match. Find out why you got disappointed and work on it, sometimes we just get unlucky, not worth clinging onto misery."
"Many people will give you various excuses for things you can apparently improve to increase your chances but after doing all of those things long ago I still had no hits (I never messaged anyone first because I'm shy and everyone apparently hates 'hi' which is all i know how to open with). 

So after all those frustrations I threw my hands in the air and deleted the apps for good and never looked back. Couldn't take the pain anymore and it felt really good. 

I don't think you're doing anything wrong. I just think everyone looks at everyone else on the app and says 'I can do better' or some shit like that."
"And unfortunately a lot of countries don't accept homophobic persecution as a ""valid"" reason to seek asylum. And those that do often have bizarre ""gay tests"" apparently one man was denied asylum because they did not know what a ""size queen"" was."
"&gt;tank topped bum boys

This guy sounds pretty gay, lmao"
So that's where all my bixers went??
"I put my phone on the table where other person can see, but faced down and I turn off notifications. Mostly because I usually leave my phone in back pocket and it's awkward sitting down. I've been in dates where they're on their phone and I'm like hm.. k well unmatch after and move on. However, I've been on dates where the phone has contributed to conversation, like showing some pictures of family/pets/looking up places or things that contribute."
"So he's stealing those clothes? Crashing pool parties? Again, why is he asking for money?"
"I’m a smoker and all of this is true. It’s an addiction, so if you haven’t smoked you don’t quite get how hard it is to quit. Worse still, some ex-smokers forget.

Don’t try it; I guarantee you’ll regret it. And if you’re an addict as am I already, keep trying to quit... I guess. Best of luck anyway."
"For what it's worth, I have similar feelings and a couple trips to gay saunas have made made more at peace with my body"
But. We split the boyfriend right ?
Tell them you thought you recognized him from conversion therapy. You’ll never see or hear about him again. They’ll make sure.
Americans : left the British for religious freedom... 243 years later and Americans are having more issues with people wanting to make their country a theocracy.
"Same thing goes for in the bedroom. Some peeps believe that just because they're super hot or just because they have a big dick, or big booty, they don't have to do much in the sheets. I mean they pretty much just lay there lmao then after they question if it was the best sex you ever had, ""
..... Sure."""
Bixers are best 👌

Crushing on every straight male friend I had because they were nice to me
This 100%
"I find those making statements like ""young people are clueless"" are usually the clueless ones. 

Young people are both the best of us and the worst of us, and everything inbetween, just like every other generation that has gone before."
Cut guy here. No lube for masturbation. Skin still slides. I’ve had guys and girls tell me I’m “not really cut though” so maybe I just have more skin than other cut individuals?
"You mean for any topic?

The thing which always surprise me, when i read here, is the importance of money. Someone doesn't have a job? Then he's not independent. That's SO WEIRD to read that for me : ""he has to have a job, he has to be able to handle himself"", like if life was some kind of jungle, and and job the proof on anything...

Or some people who say they can not ""go out"" because they have no money (or no car), which is extra-weird for any European living in a big city. Or talks about loans, debts - i know nobody in my friends who has any debt... Seing someone asking how much a medical treatment cost is also kinda exotic.

The second thing is the weight or religion, which seems everywhere. I don't know if it changes a lot of things regarding homophobia (people in Europe don't need religion to be homophobic), but that's still so surprising in a modern society."
"Getting old does not always mean getting fat. There are old people who work out a lot and maintain a ripped physique. Most weigh the benefits of being fit at their advanced age and decide against putting in the effort understandably. 


It sounds like you had a bad Grindr experience. Nothing is stopping you from improving your situation and getting into shape. Will you pull a 20 year old fit guy? Maybe not, but you will fare better than you do now."
"As a man over 30 with a BMI over 30, yeah."
"Its a great journey. Enjoy yours. I found life really got interesting and fun around 30-35 and onwards. Career finally kind of on lock and ticking over nicely. Got all the partying and drugs mostly out of my system. No social drama. Managed to keep myself debt free thankfully as well. 

Enjoy the next few decades. They are fantastic. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. Getting older is very freeing in many ways."
still waiting...
"Aw, dude, I'm right there with ya. I actually can't get to sleep most of the time without fantasizing about even just cuddling with someone. Sometimes I can even imagine the feel of their touch. It's definitely normal, plus it shows you desire affection and love, and there's nothin' unhealthy about that."
I'd say that over 90% of the cut guys especially in the US were cut as infants. Cut is all we've known so we can't tell you what feels better.
"Another instance with a particular guy also resonates with me now that I think about it. I had smoked 420 just to take the edge off, but I guess it made me more in tune with my emotions so when another guy who reminded me of my dad touched my leg I reactively twitched and held up my hand to make him stop. Poor guy probably didn't know what happened, but can imagine him taking it personally--as if he was scary or something. He ran out of the sauna so quick! I wanted to try to explain that it wasn't him, it was just my trauma, but I wasn't about to have a therapy session with him at the bathhouse  😅"
"I call straight guys Lesbians instead of Gay, it hurts the more :D"
"One article is behind a paywall, the other is an interview with him that shares little personal info and just some vague information about the country in general. 

The GoFundMe is vague as to what the money will pay for. The description says he needs €10,0000 but he cut it to €6,000 for the GoFundMe. It doesn't say how much the visa application is. And there isn't much mention of why he can't get a job now besides that he is a student. Which really doesn't make much sense to me because kids all over the world get a job as a student. And then the pics kind of seem to indicate he isn't exactly poor. There are also no specifics about his current living situation or how he seemingly lives openly gay while living in the country despite such a significant threat. It's just too many unanswered questions for me to donate money."
Dude if he keeps fingering you after you've said no that's fucked up - no wonder you weren't into it. You just might not be a guy who likes hookups - theres nothing wrong with that.
"When I was 18, only 40 year olds pursued me. 

When I was in my early 40s, only 18 year olds pursued me. 

In neither case was I seeking them out.

(I'm now in my late 40s, and guys in their 30s are the only ones pursuing me.)"
"Oh British politics is about to get hilarious bad. Cabinet ministers are resigning in protest. The Torys have gone a fucked up massively and they know it. They only had a one-vote majority coalition and the party decides knock-off Trump is a good idea lol.

Bet Labor calls a no confidence vote soon. There's no way Parliament allows this moron rule for too long."
"yeah, it’s absolutely is a psychological thing... it sounds like you need more than meaningless sex, you need a connection with the person in order to enjoy it.

i’m the same - i hate hookups, and have to be emotionally connected to my partner or else i don’t feel anything."
"You called someone disgusting and you’re shocked you got banned? Grow the fuck up, snowflake."
"I swore I’d never end up as the leery old man at the end of the bar and was surprised when I realised I became the leery old man at the end of the bar. I’ve not been in a gay bar since, after nearly thirty solid years of being part of the gay scene(ry) on three continents. There were rough periods, but by God were my days (and nights!) varied and interesting!

I have been pleasantly surprised though, to discover, after leaving the scene, that it was (and is) such a tiny slice of a world that’s even bigger and more wondrous than I could have imagined. 

My tastes have matured, mellowed and metamorphosed in the 16 years since I turned 30 and though I have no regrets over my previous incarnation, I’m excited for my future, free from the laser-sharp judgementality of the babygays, whom I’m hoping will experience the many epiphanies that come with advanced years. Youth may well be wasted on the young, but I’d offer the caveat that this is only true if they believe they’ll be forever young...taste every moment! x"
This is the most outrageous ghosting story I've heard.
or you can make your own choices and let other grown adults make theirs.
I agree. Get off the Dating apps. Try Meetup and see if theres any LGBT Groups in your area. In the very least you will find some New Friends who may open up a whole New Outlook on things for you. Not everyone is put off by scars/burns ect. One of my Best Buddies growing up was burned by grease as a kid and had some scars. His Personality drew people to him. Hes a Great Guy still. Dont give up on Yourself. Smile!  Hugs!!!
"&gt; Don't expect your boyfriend to be one either. 

that isn't how it works. We don't live in a karmic world. There are plenty of people out there who aren't even remotely a prince charming and get exactly what they want in a partner through good looks, and likewise there are people who are very sweet and loyal and never find the right person for them."
"Damn dude... 
Whether it were for a lack of awareness or empathy, that guy didn't deserve *your* attention anyway."
"I can see that being a gay porn tittle, I'd be surprised if it wasn't already."
"&gt;others do the work for him

***just like our Trump!***"
"If these were ""average"" guys, few would be swooning over them."
"Tbh I think the idea that Europe is some gay paradise, don't get me wrong it's very forward thinking compared to some places, but there is still homophobia about. For example my grandmother is irish Catholic. I can't come out to her because it would kill her, I'm her only grandson. So the perfect gay life doesn't always exist over here."
"So, you have a cold/flu and you've automatically got hiv? Calm the fuck down."
"because ""model"" sounds better than ""part-time waiter."""
Getring in a relationship with a guy was pretty gay.
It’s Grindr/Scruff/Tinder’s fault!
Pretty accurate description tbh
"Not pathetic, but if you ever encounter him again, maybe say hi? Never know where it may go. May be nothing, may be soulmate? I can relate though. I've been single for ten years now. I haven't dated in so long, I almost don't know what to do lol. I mostly enjoy my solitude, but sometimes I wish I had a man to care for and a man to care for me. Someone to cuddle to sleep and chit chat about whatever. Someone I can wake up to and not want to get out of bed because I don't want to leave their side, instead of my current situation of not wanting to get up because I'm tired. Maybe someday."
I can't wait until school starts again.
And this was *before* visions of Gideon.
"If they only message you when they’re drunk or when they want sex, that’s a big red flag. Also if they come back to a subject that you’ve told them makes you uncomfortable. 

Biggest thing though: listen to your instincts. If there’s a bad feeling in your gut about someone, it’s prob for a reason."
"Step 1: Find someone without hangups on who's ""straight acting"" or fem. You'll be better off for it.

Step 2: Become someone without  hangups on who's ""straight acting"" or fem. You'll be better off for it."
"Speaking as a doppelbanger, I'm already there, mate."
"Not European (Australian) but I noticed that some commenters have really strong opinions about age differences. Like some people say it MUST be predatory manipulation if a 27 year old has sex with someone who's just turned 18. Or ""why would a 25 year old want to get involved with a 19 year old? Something's not right"". 

Meanwhile I'm sitting here thinking: age of consent here is 16. I was graduated from high school and completed my first year of university at 17. And at 18 you get all the freedoms and responsibilities of adults. Sometimes an 18 year old simply is mature enough to decide to sleep with someone older than them. 

Also, there's far less worrying about masc/fem tops or bottoms. Most people here are pretty comfortable with what they like, and aren't so strongly influenced by porn culture."
"Sometimes you love someone and can't get them off your mind, but all they want to do is use you for sex. So you can try all you want to get them to love you, but all you get back is hurt."

....a nearly naked cute guy?  :-)
"Dude - as an ex smoker I can honestly say - you are an addict. 

You will literally say anything to justify your addiction - no judgement, I did the same thing! 

'Learn good hygiene' - no. We can tell. A non-smoker can always tell. You might not smell it but we can. Brutal honesty here - you reek. Unless you're washing your hair after every cigarette, showering, changing your clothes and downing an entire bottle of listerine after every cigarette - we can tell.

The reduction if stress? Also no. A lot of the reason you're stressed is the nicotine withdrawl!!! I remember the feeling - it's like anxiety and stress and worry and panic all rolled into one - when I stopped smoking it disappeared - you're smoking to chase the feeling of calm - because your brain is screaming for relief from withdrawal.

When you quit - especially if you're a heavy smoker - food tastes amazing, you can smell things, your stress levels drop through the floor, you have more £$£ to spend on yourself, you don't stink up the room and you're less likely to die of the 1000's of illnesses smoking can cause.

I know all that was harsh so I apologise for that - you do you - so long as you're happy! But as an ex smoker I say again - it has no upsides. Self-justifiction is a powerful mental tool, but can also work against you. *hugs*"

"Because it sounds fishy as hell, have you ever met a person in need? A self centred duck facing Instagram guy doesn't look, or most importantly, act like a person in need. I'm not gonna give a guy money just because *insert African country* and *hot gay*"
So people’s lives are literally threatened with state sanctioned violence and you think this is appropriate
"I am like 15 % body fat and some guys ""compliment "" me on my sexy dad bod and I get called a bear. I hate how screwed gay men's perception of bodies are."
Yeah he probably uses it ten times a day
No lies detected
"Poverty, religion, and oppression. The worst combo."
"Yeah honestly, don’t worry about the label thing. Just think of it as “I like this person so I’m going to pursue them” it helps that said person is a close friend. 

So just go for it. 

Talk about what happened and if his response is positive, say that you liked it and him and would want to do it again, with him."
To me it sounds like you’re more of a doormat than controlling. You let this piece of shit walk all over you and then you let him convince you it’s your fault?
Aaaaaannnd keep us updated 👍🏼
"I hope you are working on building your family you can enjoy.  I always have said, real families are not the ones you are born into."
Masturbate to gay porn all the time.
Can you go into more detail about the cheap place to take a nap aspect? Sleeping is my favorite hobby and I hate to be caught somewhere without a place to nap.
That’s what makes this filter not really accurate. The setting of ‘only want to have a real date’ and ‘quick hookup’ could change by the minute for anyone.
It's such a massive insult. Phone in pocket. POCKET IT lol this is supposed to be date
I don't know how to respond to that without sounding like a jerk.
"&gt;But if you were a happy, well adjusted 40 something, would *you* want a partner you have nothing in common with, who is financial dead weight and who is physically in a very different place than yourself?

Yeah, if I'm single and he comes along and wants me and we get along well. Frankly I've been out of the closet for 30 years and Mr Rights are few and far between, and a guy comes along and we get along well and we think each other are sexy and he happens to be young and not financially able to keep up with me because of his age and doesn't know anything about my interests... I can *teach* him about sewing and knitting and cooking and music and architecture and flowers and art and dogs and travel (if we get along well he's going to have an active enough mind to want to learn and be kind enough that he is willing to pick things up from me over time), and there's a *reason* I literally killed myself to earn enough money to be able to be a good provider.

If he wants a decrepit old man who is kinda hanging on to life but who has decades of experience behind him and a lifetime of trying to be a good and interesting person, who am I to argue? It actually used to be quite common among gay men that older man A would have a relationship with younger man B, and eventually after man A dies, man B has gotten older and has a relationship with younger man C, to whom he can pass on the money and possessions and the cycle can continue. No, by no means is it necessary that anyone in particular has to be into this, but among guys who are, it's a way of life that works."
If you lubed it first that stick up your ass would feel nice.
"""How can you ask to fuck anyone if you wouldn't even do as much as to fuck yourself?"""
"Sorry I just pictured him,  ass up texting while you fuck him and couldn't stop laughing. 

Seriously though, do it back to him. Either he'll notice or he won't. 

Maybe just ignore him completely and when he finally notices you've moved out, taken the furniture, the food and TV and rent is due he'll realize what a complete tool he is. 

Or you could just accept that he's an inconsiderate twirp and you should've dumped his ass a long time ago."
I don't smoke but I don't really mind guys who do.
Yep - anything with 'cooling' or sensation coatings are not meant for bum-fun! I tried a warming lube once - never again! Felt like I'd been raped by a blowtorch.... 🤣
"It's *worthwhile* to come out, imo.  

When I was in the closet, acting like I'm into girls and trying to ""blend in"" with my straight friends is exhaustive.  I'd need to constantly mind my pronouns and when I would do something gay centric (or sometimes even suggest I was gay) I'd just shrug and talk in very vague terms.  Like, ""I watched this awesome movie called Weekend and omg it was so good"" turned into ""I don't know.  I didn't do much.  How was your weekend?""   

I'm just free to make small talk and be myself and it's soooo much easier.  You don't need to actively come out with a megaphone with everyone you meet, but don't lead them onto thinking you're straight.  If they ask if you have a girlfriend, don't just say ""No"" (even though that's literally true), say ""nah.  I'm into dudes.  But I don't have a boyfriend either so about the same"""
Oh it is so disgusting and horrible!  Now a days the costs are ridiculous!  Some places have a pack of smokes at $15.... $15!!!!   I started smoking and they were 75 cents a pack!
He’s not your friend. Dump that toxic shit from your life and take care of your mom.
Fuck right off.
I imagine I’ll feel exactly like that when I’m 50. I’m 30 and am skeptical of anyone younger than 25. Young people are boring lol.
Good boy until we get to the bedroom
"No. I was blessedly unaware of this ""issue,"" and want nothing to do with it now that I know about it. Sounds like someone's juvenile, misguided attempt to make a point about something."
"lmao. if you're entitled to share your opinion then so am i? you know what sub you're in bud?

&gt;This is where you can ask the manly men for their opinions on various topics.

also there's not even a question in your post so don't know why you're here."
"&gt;There are plenty of people out there who aren't even remotely a prince charming and get exactly what they want in a partner through good looks

Are you basing this off of social media or experience? Those relationships hardly last unless they're a sugar-daddy-sugar-baby types. Believe it or not, but even pretty good looking people have emotional needs and long for affection."
"I also think some people just don’t know how to actually fuck, tbh. I’ve been with a few guys who clam up at sex."
Wow where you also a navy seal who graduated at the top of their class?
Same. I once had a girl shove my face in her boobs to make another guy jealous.
Please try
this.
Dude this is pretty crazy.
fucking ouch and honestly the RUDENESS. I would have probably screamed at him to gtfo lol jesus mate thats rough.
"&gt; My local clinics are run by gays and I feel like they judge.

Don't be daft. They do not judge. They help. Get your ass over there."
I think the sex was a coincidence tbh. Immodium and plenty of fluids. Hope you feel better dude! *hugs*
I’m not white tall blonde muscular and rich enough to be Prince Charming
"That wasn't his point.  First of all, the thread says that ""We always talk about old men with such disdain"" and that was hardly disdain.  But that's a separate issue.  

To be very simplistic, here are some examples:  People who were born in the 90s and around 2000 will have no idea what the world was like before 9/11, for example.  The same cohort will not get pop culture references to movies and TV shows on in the 90s.  I've run into this already with quoting a very infamous movie that was out in 97 with someone who was 25.  They were ""clueless"" about it.   Further, younger people (for obvious financial reasons and because they're in school) are less likely to have traveled much / left the country or experienced nearly as much in their careers...which is a big topic of conversation.  It's really not that complicated of a concept that he's trying to get across.  You also took the statement out of context because he was talking about having *conversations* with them as I also reiterated above.  This was the rest of his sentiment that you did not quote:

&gt; Young people have very little to actually say *conversation* wise that I have any interest in what so ever.

That's the main point.  I could write several more paragraphs about this but apparently you think its indecent and disrespectful to point out these basic things &amp; so I doubt it'll change your mind.  But for other people reading this thread, that was clearly the point.  I doubt this applies to 100% of younger people, and apparently the people in /r/gayyoungold are doing just fine - but I can't believe you'd twist what he wrote into him not ""having common decency."""
"Cool, but hey. Don't flush pills down the toilet..."
I mean getting called a faggot and having everyone guess my sexual orientation on a daily basis until I started changing in the stall was pretty fucking uncomfortable
Females to me are like paintings. I can appreciate them but I’ll never touch them.
"I think you need to be honest with him first and foremost. You should tell him something along the lines of, hey, I know we've had a lot of fun. But I think I'd like to break things off. Maybe add in a couple of platitudes too, you know, reassure him but it's not him specifically but you're just kind of not feeling like the situation is right for either of you anymore. Whatever you do, please don't ghost him. You'll really hurt him."
you just know. puberty just gives what you know a name.
"I admire all the activists who tried, but the fight is so unfair in this case... If you were in Hungary or Romania, then there is EU, but in Russia there is no higher rank to which you can appeal. Wish you luck!"
"Not personally, no. Or at least not as a life partner. Hopefully at 40 I'll be long married by then, but theres some 40 year olds now that didnt get the chance to be married because things were a lot different back then."
