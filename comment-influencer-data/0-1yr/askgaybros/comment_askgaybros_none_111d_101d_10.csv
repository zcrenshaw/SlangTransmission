"I would say ‚Äúdude I can hear you guys at night, keep it down or mom and dad will hear you too‚Äù. Keep it vague. You don‚Äôt have to tell him you hear him having sex."
They just don't want to offend. Politely but firmly tell them that your preferred term is pigslut fuckslave. Lock eyes and make them repeat it.
"You're a great brother. When I came out to mine, he called me a faggot and didn't talk to me for seven years. People like you make my heart swell. Thanks, man."
‚ÄúEncrypt your dick pics‚Äù WAIT WHAT? They actually have the forethought to do that?? Haha wow
"Babahahahahahahjajahahjahanjana

I was reading the title and my first reaction ‚Äúwell shit, this is gonna give all them gbffs some hope‚Äù. 

Phew. Good one."
Don‚Äôt feel bad. Sounds like he had it coming for a long time.
You two are awesome parents and sound like a great family.
"He's keeping his distance cause he doesn't wanna scare the hell out of you. But be honest with yourself and if it was something you enjoyed or might want to keep exploring, talk to him. If you rather forget about the whole thing, then let things cool down for a while."
*They had us in the first half not gonna lie*
"I like this. Say it nicely in a big bro kinda way. Ask yourself if you were in his position how would you feel if your big brother said something? It's likely he'll feel the a same. 

But if he was bringing over girls for sex would you say something? If so what?"
"I'd have no problem with that because it doesn't involve pretty much forcing him out of the closet. (Which isn't something I want to do, but better me than mom and dad.) I'd just tell him I can hear him having sex and say I'm too young to be an uncle so watch what you're doing."
They listen to Katy Perry
"I think that's because your subconscious thinks you have a chance with them, making them more appealing to you."
"No shit, we share the same iPad. I lost it. Good shit."
"Drugs don‚Äôt turn people gay.  Good luck, sir."
And I oop...
"As a shirtless runner, I definitely don't mind people looking. As long as you don't honk your horn or scream out your window, which always scares the bejeesus out of me"
I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he start talking to you again after 7 years or that still going on?
"Yes, talk about it.  Do *not* tell him ""it was just the molly"".

If it's something you'd prefer to explore again with him, that's something to discuss.  If you had a good time but would rather just stick to friend-level interaction with the guy, that's also something to say to him."
Maybe he's just helping your bro with algebra. Algebra can get very intense at times
"I‚Äôm gay, and as someone who snuck boys into the house from time to time, I would want my brother to tell me he knew (or suspected). Are you close with your brother? Like, would he think you‚Äôre a total dipshit for bringing this up, or would he maybe look to you for guidance? Feel free to message me if you want!"
Is there a sub for potato guys like us? I tend to go for fellow spuds.
"Also, as I have found on numerous occasions Molly doesn't make you do anything that you didn't already have some integral desire to find. It was always there, but make sure you talk about it and lessen the tension. 
Much love!!"
"We aren't super *super* close, but only because I haven't lived at home for the past 4 years. And when he was 13 and I 18, we didn't really have much in common.

We do get along though, and I always ask him about his life and we spend time together when I'm at home. So I hope he knows I love and care about him and that I'm on his side."
"I was discussing my fiance to my (old, white) doctor the other day, used that term, used he/him pronouns, in discussion of a medical procedure. 

At the end, he was like ""well you'll need to make sure your *friend* is there to pick you up"". Like, really? The one thing you know about my relationship with him is that he *isn't* my friend."
Often I look awful at the beginning of a haircut - so my powers decline for a week before it grows out
"We only started talking after seven years at the funeral of our sister. But we have no relationship whatsoever. The last time we talked was my mother's funeral about four years ago. He now has two boys who I've only seen twice since they were born. And both times at the funerals. I got over it a long time ago, actually. I don't even feel like I have a brother, tbh. At this point, he's simply a distant family member at best. Like that third cousin you see at family reunions every five years."
"Congratulations mate. The first time I had a dick in my mouth was my moment of clarity. I vividly remember thinking 'yep, I like guys' when I was blowing him. Good on you for having the balls to try it and discover you enjoy it.

What's your next step? You gonna explore this side of you more now?"
"As a middle-aged straight guy, I came here to say this. But you said it better. ""Partner"" is now my go-to word for anyone who I know is in a monogamous relationship, but I don't know how they prefer to describe it (husband / fianc√© / boyfriend / pigslut fuckslave / etc)."
Can you put me in your will right now? I'll be fine with anything.
"‚òùÔ∏è Here‚Äôs your answer.  Molly isn‚Äôt an excuse. If you use it as one, don‚Äôt be shocked if your friend calls BS.  There is nothing wrong with chalking it up to drug fueled experimentation, but don‚Äôt insult him by saying the drugs made you do it.  The drugs helped you do it."
"Wait, that's a thing you can do?"
"Lots of guys should learn from your example. Kindness is lacking in today's hookup culture, but it goes a long way."
"Thank you!  I am lucky too, I have great kids."
The best shorts are silkies
"It's great you aren't in favor of pushing someone out of the closet. Yes I agree better you than your parents. 

You are an awesome brother! üëç

He's young so I'd suggest keep an eye out for older predators whenever you can."
"He's acting like this because he doesnt wanna weird you out, or maybe he thinks youre weirded out about it and doesnt know what to say. 

It is kinda tricky for us gay guys to deal with these kinda situations because we dont wanna ruin our friendships over a high hookup. If you're whatever about it just talk to him as you usually do and make sure that you let him know its not a big deal with your actions."
Gym shorts outside of athletic activities are equal parts hot and trashy.
"Not shirtless, but this is my favorite picture of me running: http://imgur.com/IhnMZlJ"
I wasn't thinking about his relationship at all. I persuaded my boyfriend to come along to the party and then my ex insulted him. I just couldn't ignore that.
Straight is a very unattractive quality. Unrequited attraction sucks.
THIS IS SO AWESOME!! YAY!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Our country has got to stop sending troops off for needless wars and then ignore the fact that they come back damaged with PTSD and depression and tons of mental problems that need to be addressed and treated just as though they were physical wounds! I am so sorry for you loss!
"I just want a guy to hug as a giant body pillow, and then we just fall asleep in eachother's arms"
"Exactly. You did nothing wrong because his relationship isn‚Äôt your issue. Besides, maybe his boyfriend got mad at him for the way he acted and what he said to you."
"Because you met him on grindr!! You can sugar coat it as much as you want, but you just hooked up with a dude that has a near endless catalog of hot horny guys in his pocket at full time."
Tell that to Alex Jones and those damned Frogs!!!
"""encryptyourdickpics""

/r/brandnewsentence"
well gay dudes don't love me either
The best thing I ever did to start attracting ladies was embracing my gay side
Summer is for gym shorts and winter is for gray sweatpants.
But my straight friend touched my thigh once so we‚Äôre basically a thing
"This was very sweet to read, seriously good parenting from both you and your wife. Great to see a family being so communicative."
I agree with your boyfriend. It sounds like your ex is a toxic person and his relationship would've ended either way. Way to stick up for yourself you deserve happiness and if he cant be supportive of you and see how happy you are... well fuck him üòã
There are encrypted messaging apps yes. I mean the person you send it too still has to be trustworthy still.
"This could be the reason, but there could be another reason that he hasn't discussed.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't reach conclusions based on gossip. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to go further with this guy, talk to him about it again, later, after he had a chance to mull things over a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

If he still doesn't want to, stop, and move on. You can't force people to do things, even if the reasons they don't want to do them are not the wisest."
"Seriously, I downvoted it before I saw the rest of the post. That shit is insufferable"
"/u/bigbrobutnotthatbig, this answer is closer than any other that I've read to what I think you should do, but I think it still goes to far. Just wait for any private moment to say, ""By the way, I've wanted to tell you, I don't think you realize ...,"" and after waiting for him to give you his full attention, ""I don't think you realize how much noise you make in your room."" In that moment, he'll almost certainly understand. If he pretends not to understand, just mildly tell him again, ""I don't think you realize how much noise you make in your room.""

Don't, for god's sake, say ""you guys"" or ""at night"" or mention ""Mom and Dad."" Don't ""sit him down."" Don't get him ""out of the house"" first. Don't say or do anything that would heighten the drama of the moment. 

In this moment, you know only the one thing he needs to know right now. Just give him the information he needs, and thereby let him understand for himself the other key point, which is that you're not going to say anything to anyone. Just keep coming back mildly to the one thing he needs to know: ""You're noisier in your room than you realize. That's all. I knew that you would want me to tell you."" Show him, don't tell him, that his secret is safe with you.

You only need to put across those two points right now. Anything else can come later. When he's ready, he'll find you in your room."
not if you sort by new they‚Äôre not
"I'd say something along the lines of 'might wanna keep it down when Marks over buddy, don't want mum and dad to hear'.

I probably wouldn't say anything more, the tone of how you say it will show him that you're ok with it and he'll come to you if he needs to chat. 

Also make sure he's doing it safely.  Not because his mate has stis, but because if he goes out and explores later with others (especially off apps), he should be safe."
My condolences? The gayest thing about me is that I watched one episode of Queer Eye and now I do the spray-delay-walk away thing. But is that even gay? It just sounds logical.
"Grindr is addictive I think. 

I‚Äôve only just started using it and I can see the attraction. An endless supply of different kinds of men and sex at your fingertips 24/7.  Never ending all you can eat buffet of men whenever you want!

And if you‚Äôre someone who has your career and social life in order, this can be a very seductive trap to fall into, essentially contracting out the sex/intimacy function of your life without the hassle of attempting a serious relationship."
"I find it much more exciting to see the dick of someone I know.  Random dick pics are hot and still ferk-off-to-able but theres no bigger connection

That said, I'd never pay for it..."
Thank you for being an amazing brother.
"God, that sucks. It's great that you got over it though. I obviously can't relate, but we also have shitty family members that we stopped seeing and talking to. Just because you're related to someone by blood doesn't make them *family*."
"I don't know if it makes them more attractive. Just takes away a lot of the confusion.

My BF is openly bi. Like 50/50 bi, not just ""occasionally"" attracted to women like I am. I find his bisexuality to be a huge enigma. And at some level a huge turn on. Like it would be so much easier for him in society to settle down with a woman, but he chooses to face possible adversity to be with me."
"Just be white, 18-23, generic looking, and stick a backwards ball cap on, then reap your karma.

I wouldn't post on there even if I was pretty, the comments are all so weird and fake-nice."
Yes. All the time
"This is his decision to make. Whether he decides to stay openly gay or pretends to be straight around his family, he's the one who should decide (and live with) what option to take. No one else should decide that for him, or pressure him one way or the other.

That said, you're also not obliged to do anything for him that you're not personally comfortable with."
One of the first classes at gay school is introductory logic.
"Just had to reply here and compliment your ""too young to be an uncle"" joke lol, thatd definitely clear the air and make it seem more light for both of you!"
"&gt; Anyway he asked me for my phone number and said we should see eachother again ie on a date not just sex. 

Haha, that's an old trick : he asks for you phone to not give him yours. 

&gt; I don't get why people say one thing and do another. What happened to being upfront and honest.

Because most people are coward (it's always difficult to say to someone ""i don't want to have sex with you anymore"", whatever the way you say it), and that a certain app culture helped them to think it's normal act like that. But i don't know if it related to gay men. A lot of my female friend goes threw the same shit."
You should take a clothes-less picture for verification purposes
"Did in middle school and high school, usually with my FWbs. But in the military, i did with a certain roommate i had a crush on. We would both jerk off together to straight porn of course, while he was watching i was looking at him. We would sleep naked all the time and walk around naked all the time. He was and is straight but man he had a nice ass and nice cock."
"I busted out laughing at that part. I can only imagine how the tone was like, ‚ÄúNo fucking duh, you twerp. You‚Äôre still a little shit, gay, bi or straight.‚Äù"
"Can I just say the closet was the darkest and loneliest experience of my life and if my bro said something like ""I think I heard you with your guy friend, and I want you to know I'll always be your brother and want you to be happy"" (or something like that)...I would remember that for the rest of my life. 

Text it to him if you can't say it. I guarantee you he needs to hear it from you. Like, really needs to hear it."
Why not? I'll put your name in under my dog's. She thinks she entitled to everything I own and she'd be angry otherwise. I'll tell you now I don't have much though.
Subconscious? With me it‚Äôs like DingDingDingDing!
"FWIW - I have a hard time at times saying the word ""husband"". It doesn't come naturally. And we've been together for 22 years, married for 4. I didn't grow up with the concept of gay marriage. Partner comes much easier, but I want to make a point and state that I'm married. I cannot fault straight folk for it if I struggle with it myself."
Why am I imagining a dick with flashing emergency colours.
"Yeah, when I realized what might be happening I was like awww my little brother is in love with his cute little friend, and then I come here and people are like TELL HIM ABOUT AIDS AND PREDATORS. üòì"
"What do you mean, like online? I don't live at home anymore, so I can only *warn* him against creepy old guys, but I can't prevent him from doing whatever he wants to do. But him and Mark seem to be inseparable, at least for now, so I hope this isn't something to worry about at the moment."
"I come in to this post expecting some gay/straight guy romance trope story horrible cringepost that would make my eyes roll back so far into my head I‚Äôd see my own brain as it implodes from annoyance.

But you got a good chuckle out of me. Now take your goddamn upvote!"
"Honestly, I think the situation is far more tense for you guy than it ever is for me and my husband especially because we do look pretty similar. The first time some poor realtor went with '....brother?' we realized we gotta go first with introductions."
"And if you don't, that sub has very narrow, generic tastes."
"*Hey sexy, let me tell you all about asking my little brother how his day went ;) ;) ;)* 

Like that?"
I don‚Äôt know but your brothers relationship sounds like relationship goals to me
Let me put my tea on...
"Right? I'm not at all attracted to the ""model type""; they just look too perfect and prissy. I'd drastically prefer an average looking guy to that..."
Or worse Taylor Swift.
Omg this. Do you ever sometimes feel like it‚Äôs a curse to be attracted to men? They literally piss me off so much but I love them ‚òπÔ∏è
"The only sensible thing to do really is throw a party, invite all 20 lovers. Delete all the doors, stick a couch in front of the fire. Lock your boyfriends sim in the adjacent room with a window. Set fire to all of his lovers while he watches. Then once they're all dead, move all the gravestones into the room with the sim so you can watch him starve to death whilst being perpetually haunted by the ghosts of his long dead conquests.

We've all done it....."
You mean gay men paid to act straight doing gay shit.
The sub tends to go for white jocks and twinks. Those guys get all the upvotes. Occasionally someone outside of that gets upvotes but do t feel too bad if you don‚Äôt fit the mold. I also suggest unfollowing the sub if you‚Äôre mental health is actually deteriorating from it.
Yeah I had a similar feeling. Since I actually enjoyed it I think I am going to start doing more and trying things out. At the moment being with a guy seems so much more fun then anything I can do with women. I am for sure going to try more
"The problem is that gay bars, gay churches, and gay clubs are pretty much non-existent in most places. Many people are frustrated with Grindr but they keep coming back because it's the only option. 
The suggestion of going to these gay spaces and gay events pretty much amounts to ""move to the city."""
Can we see pics of you running shirtless. Thanks in advance
Hes not your friend
"Technically speaking, it is still his nude photos and not up for the gay community to decide if they want to share or not.

The thing about ""human rights"" is all humans get them, not just the ones we approve of."
"I do think in a lot of cases it is homophobia though. Whether it‚Äôs on purpose to belittle their relationship or because the person saying it is just still so uncomfortable with a same-sex couple it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù for them. In some cases though I‚Äôve had people say they didn‚Äôt know if the individuals liked ‚Äúhusband‚Äù or ‚Äúpartner,‚Äù my usual advice is 1) you can just ask or 2) if they‚Äôre married just assume husband like you would any other married couple."
"See, this is why there is no gay agenda.  We can't agree on any thing.  You had a simple problem (I know not so simple) and 100 of us gave you a different answer.  I am glad you survived this very embarrassing situation.   

Advice on women:  Let them know what a kind caring brother you are.  That will be a huge turn on."
"That would make the most sense, wouldn't it?"
Yeah I like tubby working class dudes.
The gay agenda has been revealed.
"My fiance and I recently went *shopping for wedding bands* and around half the retailers we visited referred to us as ""friends"". I'm like damn people, we're literally both trying on rings, how can I make this clearer for you"
"Never atribute to malice, what you can attribute to ignorance. 

I would suspect that for most of their lives they simply weren't exposed to many gay people/relationships. With it being a foreign concept to them, they probably aren't entirely sure how to approach the situation. Gay acceptance happened slowly over the past several decades in the background, then all of a sudden in the past 10 years or so. Gays are still a small minority of the population so even with mainstream acceptance, these people probably still haven't been exposed to gay people/relationships. 

Please don't call people homophobes for not understanding things they aren't familiar with."
You would love the noise of my balls hitting the sides of my legs when I run up and down the stairs.

"This sounds good but I also want him to know that I'm not just cool about it but that he has my 100% support in whatever. I don't know what it's like being in the closet but I imagine that he only has Mark to confide in about anything concerning that part of his life. And I'd like him to know he has more options.

I already asked someone else this, but is there anything other than condoms I should maybe say to him regarding safe sex?"
"I'd ask very directly. ""I'd really like to bring my boyfriend. Hes a large part of my life, and I would love to have him there to celebrate with me, for you and your bride. Is there any reason he couldn't come?""

Wait for response. If it comes down to they havent met, maybe not understanding how serious you two are, find a way to fix that before the wedding. Explain that he isnt a fling, but a serious boyfriend. If it comes down to an issue with your sexuality, as supportive as your brother sounds, maybe consider not going.  

I would absolutely specifically identify the issue before making a decision."
i prefer the amateur homemade stuff to the studio stuff. I like watching real gay men have sex and not straight men being paid to act gay.
"As one of them bear bottom types, I just have to say... Thank you for your service."
"I tried running shirtless, they threw a shirt at me üòî"
"As you know, X is a tricky bitch and i'm sure they were just trying to find her."
He obviously doesn't quite accept who he is yet. All you can do is show him compassion. Im sure you know the reason he spoke smack about you is because of his own feelings but I wouldn't try talking to him again. I wouldn't mind betting he will try and talk to you in time.
"Yeah, don‚Äôt understand this part... Athleisure is a thing these days. A dick flopping around the grocery store in $80 shorts from Lululemon is most certainly not trashy."
"I know, right! When I was 17, I had my first in a series of horrible girlfriends. She was so mean to me I was embarrassed to bring her home, and Mark is here all the time and our whole family loves him."

"Can I suggest that you have Tyler over and talk to him with your son about how his parents would feel? It might make Tyler feel better to know he has support from Noah and his family. Especially, if his parents are homophobic. 

Knowing my friends were supportive changed my life. It took a burden off of me that almost killed me. Tyler sounds like the kind of kid that might need that.

I just want to add, regardless of your son being embarrassed you should not be shy about talking about sex. It's better than tip toeing around the subject like it sounds like you do. Your wife was on point about the condom advice. You should never discourage her from saying things like that. At least one of you needs to be open to talking about those things."
"Asian male here from California. Although I've never apologized, or heard of any of my friend's apologize for being Asian, it's fairly well known fact that both Asian men and African American men receive less positive engagement on social media dating apps. Sadly, in the USA there are still strong biases against people of color in regards to conventional beauty standards. It's subtle and wrong, period. 

Although I understand that we all have preferences (including myself), I always try to keep an open mind and would never exclude an entire race of individuals when it came to intimacy. As gay men, we should understand how the negative consequences of being closed minded."
You're right. But sometimes you're just hoping that there's a miraculous hidden solution to your problem so you can avoid an awkward or painful conversation.

"What was the fight about? Cause to me, it sounds like he brought his new boyfriend to the party *specifically* in an attempt to provoke you and make you jealous, and the guy figured it out after your ex immediately beelined towards you and your bf to confront you, and he didn't want to be some trophy boyfriend to a guy that clearly isn't over his ex *and* deals with it like some angry 3-year-old."

Lol that‚Äôs how I cry myself to sleep at night. Like literally
"Yup mine was very similar. Only boy in a group going swimming for some girl's birthday or something so I was solo in the empty men's locker room, and I was about 8 I think. A guy I'd now consider ridiculously hot (wavy long-ish hair, strong jawline, lean muscular body, dark blonde happy trail down to a fairly neat dark blonde bush over a plump soft uncut dick, firm peach fuzz ass) emerged from the shower room fully nude as I was trying to work out how to get the locker thing to work. He nervously laughed to explain he thought he was the only one there, asked where my adult was (I explained everyone else I was with was girls and a couple of mothers) and then proceeded, still nude, to help with the jammed locker key situation. I very obviously stared at his body, ass and dick the whole time, mostly out of curiosity, and he didn't seem to care. I then hurried away to the pool in embarrassment and confusion. It was a whiiiile before I worked out that curiosity was probably attraction..."
lol more like a neurotic introvert gay here

"Believe me I am 100% on the same page about it.  I'd rather him be embarrassed than get an STD.  My wife stressed well he still needs to use a condom.

I comment this elsewhere but Noah has asked us not to say anything to Tyler because that's Tyler's wish.  The door is absolutely open but Noah is going to have to relay the information out of respect for them and right now he doesn't wish to do so yet."
"For sure. Blood relationship does not oblige you to remain close to anyone that is simply a shitty person. And this brother in particular is just a nasty person.

He‚Äôs a huge racist, xenophobic, homophobic #maga oil field roughneck."
Thank you.  Straight men want women and have sex ONLY with women.
"I‚Äôm bi. When I told my bro he was like: whatever, so you finally admit why you haven‚Äôt had a gf, ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre a fag (I think he was kidding? He‚Äôs the type of /b/ro who‚Äôs racist, anti-semitic and chauvinist but plays every racist comment he says as a 4chan joke). He was in a rough point in his life and said some things that sounded blackmailey, but he either didn‚Äôt go through with it or I misinterpreted him.

Worst thing is, I‚Äôm more attracted to girls and he has known various of my gfs at the time. 

In fact, I know that no one in my family knows how to deal with that, even though I came out about 3 or 4 months ago.

It‚Äôs worse for me. If we don‚Äôt introduce ourselves properly I‚Äôve been mistaken for my boyfriend‚Äôs son several times. And since I look super young they treat me like a high schooler which is... shitty
I am sure that was pretty much how it went down lol
"&gt;acquire communication skills

Ugh I guess I‚Äôll just stick to toys from Amazon"
"It‚Äôs a marathon, not a sprint. 

I used to eat SUPER clean for at least a week, and at the end of the week, I would have a massive cheat day. It ended up being very damaging and not very sustainable for me, so I ended up falling off the wagon multiple times. 

You need to change your mindset of fitness and a diet into a lifestyle. A diet is a ‚Äúfad‚Äù or just a temporary change. A lifestyle is just that - the style of your life. It shouldn‚Äôt be temporary. 

You want to make changes in your life so that being healthy is easy enough to continue without you breaking out of it and so it is sustainable. If that means having a small cup of ice cream (at least for me, I‚Äôm not sure about you) once every three days, then I will."
"No joke, have him watch Love Simon. When Simon freaks out in the asshole who outs him, there are some good words in there. Maybe if he sees the scene, he can understand what he did.

As mentioned before by others, he‚Äôs probably not your friend. If he can‚Äôt truly see what he has done and how wrong it is, then he‚Äôs not your friend. Your explicitly asked him not to and he chose to."
And I saw you asked for advice with women in your last post. Just act aloof and you‚Äôll be good lmao.
"They will definitely study different things, but both of their plan (for now) is to move to the city where I live to go to university. Hopefully, this will allow me to form a stronger relationship with my brother. Until then, I don't know, Whatsapp I guess."

Floppy dicks are timeless really.
YES WE DO!
"Exclusively what I run in. Howdy, Neighbors!"
I can't say yes loud enough. Went through something very upsetting last year and all I have wanted since is for someone to hug me and tell me things will be ok. Feels like I am asking for too much though.
"From what I've heard, the military is so hyper masculine that what they do loops around to the gay end of the spectrum sometimes, but they're still straight guys doing seemingly gay stuff."
I am just really genuinely happy for your kids and you as a parent and person that you have put this much thought and effort into finding the best way to deal with the situation reasonably and look after your kids happiness. Seriously A+.
"Every guy is different. You need to remember that what your ex did is not an indication of the potential behavior of your current boyfriend. If you care about this new guy, I would have a conversation with him regarding your previous relationship and the pain it caused you so he knows where you‚Äôre coming from. Your suspicions and fears are very understandable and hopefully if you are upfront with your new guy he will be supportive. More importantly, he should really know about your last relationship experience in case you have a paranoid moment. Good luck xx"
"Imagine being so obsessed with gay men and what they do in bed you download a gay dating app so you can decieve, harrass and attack them. Losers."
I only came here for the nudes...
Really? You must have the updated version. Mine is just 80 pages of the word 'cock' in size 12 Times New Roman.
"Ok that‚Äôs all great and all, but... how was the Zumba class???? Did your parents enjoyed the class???? lol"
Smh oversensitive insecure straights.
U ate his ass? I‚Äôm gay and I don‚Äôt even eat ass
Straight people eat ass too.
"Drugs don't turn people gay, but you can have sex and be horny without sexual *attraction*, especially while high."
"Hey now, I am the old one, he's supposed to teach me about technology!  Lol"
"Open the door and scream ""**GAY SEX!GAY SEX! GAY SEX!**"" And then slam it shut."
My friend used to spend  the weekends at mine started off jerking and then ended up with him fucking me this went on for about 5 years and he still acts like he is straight
"Yeah. You can see it in their faces, kind of like something gets triggered in them, a ""this feels nice and good"" type of reaction. 

I will never forget a guy I briefly dated, he had been treated like a piece of meat on the regular, but when I asked him out I remember him saying ""I just want to say thank you for not asking for a dick pic."" In a way you could tell how appreciative he was of it. Now he is one of my best friends."
dont forget people who pretend to be for the troops for elections and then shafted those military aiding bills as soon as they come over
Oh the joy of having started balding in my teens.
"Nothing to add, well covered by the bros here. I feel like I must reiterate ‚Äúdrugs dont make you gay‚Äù."
I mean I think it‚Äôs less the hookup and never speaking again so much as the ‚Äúasked for his number for a date‚Äù and then never followed up since that *is* weird and annoying.
Misery loves company.
"It's a complicated issue. Arguments can be made that they brought out hidden desires etc. However there's too many reports of self identified straight poeple who will feel comfortable or desire to do gay things when high. Usually stimulants.

I've read reports of poeple who are comfortable with their sexuality who identify as 100% straight unless they are high.

I think it's absurd to claim that mind altering substances don't have the possibility to temporary alter sexuality."
"I think it depends on how you like to socialize, but I'm speaking only from my own personal experiences here, so might be different for other people.  
  
Men, in my observation tend to be side-by-side instead of face-to-face socializers. You need a common focus or activity that brings you together.  That can be watching sports, playing sports, video games, cards, pool, hiking, climbing or any other various hobbies.  Women seem to be much more comfortable with just hanging out to talk with each other, which is not a bad thing at all.  However, if you're not into any group activities, I find it's a lot harder to make friends with other guys."
"Omg, ask him out.

I wouldn‚Äôt be so intimidated by comparing appearances with this guy. Sure looks matter a lot for a first impression or on Grindr, but a guy can become so much more (or less sometimes) attractive once you know him. I think we‚Äôve all dated or at least hooked up with a guy because he was charming or funny. Even if he wasn‚Äôt exactly what we think our ‚Äútype‚Äù is.

Besides if he is as sweet as you say, if he‚Äôs not interested he‚Äôll be flattered and probably still want to meet for lunch."
Lmaoo. James charles wants to know your secret
Start doing it. Your neighborhood thanks you for it.
I said this out loud when I opened the post lmfao I can‚Äôt stop saying it
"I came to get my rage on about expecting someone else to fix your depression, or that heartbreak is the same as depression.

Now I don‚Äôt have anyone to yell at..."
U mean of course the hot ones
"I think it's the confidence. The haircut makes *you* feel better, which changes how you carry yourself, and everyone else picks up on that."
"‚ÄúHow cute, those 2 brothers are helping each other pick out wedding bands!‚Äù"
"this one time a hottie acknowledged my existence and was nice

Honestly that's the end of the story but it played out much farther in my head."
Are you trying to tell be there's not a one in 6 million chance that he might deep down have some sort of interest in me that he doesn't want to accept because he's afraid of the social repercussions but he must because he truly is in love with me? Huh crazy
"Here's the problem in a nutshell.   When you indicated that you wanted him to stop, he didn't care about you enough.   That probably means he is simply too immature to be a good best friend.  You have to decide how much you are willing to trust him now.  When you decide that, tell him!"
"Uh that was definitely sexual assault. Blacked out or not, you didn't ask to be assaulted, and you couldn't consent if you were that drunk. Sorry dude, hope you get a support system to get through this. And hope that guy faces some consequences."
"Funny, there was this guy in the subway today with shaved head and this huge mole on the top of it. It was, too, one of those cases where it's just impossible to look away."
Keep the beard. Go to this bar called Nowhere on 14th street and you will literally drown in penis.
Used to have a straight buddy in high school who taught me the ropes. Had a massive crush on him back then. Still pretty good friends now.
Trashy (???)
Weird flex but ok
"They love it, they've been doing it since I was in high school, like 6-7 years already."
"No condolences needed, I'm bi so it's a win-win"
"They always have always been encrypted, but it‚Äôs super weak. Anyone can crack them. And Snapchat is notorious for having shit internal security..employees spying on users using internal app that‚Äôs supposed to be for testing and troubleshooting 

Biggest chance of your nudes being stolen will most of the time come from people simply taking screenshot. Don‚Äôt send trade secrets or launch codes on snap (anywhere really except Signal or similar app probably). Nudes, meh, whatever. 

Anyone who‚Äôs that worried shouldn‚Äôt send them at all. Nothing is safe once it‚Äôs stored on something connected to the internet"
"Yeah, I think the problem is that they usually refer to heterosexual couples WITHOUT any concern about what word they prefer.  If they similarly wait to ask every opposite-sex couple (‚ÄúDo you like me called her partner or her husband or her better half or her boo or her hubby or...‚Äù ) then that‚Äôs a different issue.  But if they take a step back ONLY when they see a same-sex couple and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they call each other‚Äù then they are unnecessarily ‚Äúothering‚Äù that couple.  
  It works be like if I called every male doctor ‚ÄúDr. Smith‚Äù or ‚ÄúDr. Jones‚Äù and then every time I meet a female doctor I suddenly ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù if she would rather be called Mary or Dr. Jones or Dr. Mary."
"I'm always friendly with hookups. Upon meeting I'll ask how's the weather outside or did he find the place easily. Depending on how chatty he is maybe more. A bit of chit chat at the end as well. 

Anon no talking sex gets mechanical and old real quick.

Most guys think dick is the biggest sex organ. That's not true. The brain is actually the biggest sex organ. Connect with his mind and it's Sooooo much more fun."
the most attractive guys on that sub IMO are never the ones who make the front page lol
"Move on. There is no way to maintain a relationship when one of the parties is as selfish as your bf. You will quickly grow to resent him, which you have already begun to do. 

There is no way this will turn out well."
"1. Is rare a parent gets a child who embodies exactly what they envisioned . 

2. Your parents adopted, they wanted YOU when they got you.  It's not fair to place assumptions on them.

3. You didn't ask to be gay or adopted.  It's not a choice to be gay and they made a very conscious choice to have a child, often moreso than a couple who is able to have children. 

4. What if the boy next to you ended up being a serial killer? Don't deal in what ifs, they are of no consequence.  

This is not your fault, life isn't what you imagine it and you have nothing to feel ashamed about.  Maybe you're not giving your apparently loving parents enough credit, they raised you and love you."
"Me: I'm gay.  

Mom: Ok that's fine.

[6 months later]

Me: ...and so then Mark and I went out to play mini-golf, and...

Mom: So is Mark your Special Friend?

Me: ""Special Friend""? What is that? 

Mom: You know, like is he someone you are dating?

Me: No, Mom, why would you think that?  He's straight.

Mom: I just don't know what to assume about the people you talk about?  How am I supposed to know who's who?

Dad: ^^Honey, ^^I ^^think ^^he'll ^^just ^^... 

Me: Right. Tell you what...  We can use a *special code*!  If I call someone my ""friend"" then you can assume that we are friends.  If I call someone my ""boyfriend"" you can assume that he's my boyfriend.  If I call someone my ""fianc√©"" you can assume he's someone I'm going to marry. 

Dad: [Snickers]

Mom: ..."
Unffff that‚Äôs just my type.
I think OP meant he'd say the uncle joke if his bro had a girl over. But if OP is going to mention the whole gay sex thing he should definitely do it this way. That would totally put me at ease if I was the younger bro.
"This sub in a nutshell, lol."
Approach for sure. Ignoring it will not make things better at all!
Wow I‚Äôm jealous of your brother. I‚Äôm 17 and a fucking turbo virgin. God I need a boyfriend. Or a girlfriend. I don‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôm very alone.
"nobody is making anybody feel crazy for having a normal straight crush. BUT when it comes to unreasonable, obsessive, stalker type, predatory, creepy, cringey, ""how do i turn a straight guy gay"" type of irrational behavior, people need to be called out on that shit, it doesn't look cute."
Queen by Nicki Minaj ofc
It's a pretty generic thing about social media-- people only show their best side.  My Facebook profile makes me look like some jet-setting genius but I am currently spending Saturday night alone at a dive bar playing on my phone.  It's fine.  Everybody is actually more normal and boring that you think they are.
"Definitely.  
My girlfriend is 16 years younger than I.   We were at a restaurant and I pissed her off for whatever reason, but I leaned in to give her a quick kiss and she pushed me back and said, ""for the last time dad, not in public!"" And the looks from everyone around us were f'n priceless."
"I bet he's all over there like

"Open and honest communication is one of the hardest and most important parts of a relationship.  It takes a lot of strength to speak the truth of your feelings when that could potentially scare someone you care about away.

A lot of people need practice runs with less on the line like posting on here to strangers to straighten out their thoughts and just to practice those conversations they want to have in general.  Therapy works similarly. The therapist doesn't tell you how to fix things. They help you talk out your problems and find your own way.  Kind of learning to have an honest conversation with yourself. Even that is hard."
"The only one that I know that seems to be open about this is WhatsApp, with the end to end stuff"
Fuck off you salty bitch.
"Ya I just read that you don't live home. If you can develop a relationship where he can talk to you if anything comes up could be helpful. Yes you can't prevent him from doing things but at least he shouldn't feel he has to deal with things alone. 

The same would apply if he was a girl but in that case your parents would be more aware. Great that he has a very close friend but things can change. They might go to different universities.. Etc."
"I'm not sure, we were in the kitchen and we didn't hear anything, but my friend only said it was ugly and it ended in the boyfriend telling my ex not to call him again. It seems like they had a very obvious, albeit quiet fight, so not sure if anyone heard what it was about, only that last part."
"I think that is spot onüíØ. If I had no morals I would‚Äôve expose him expeditiously, but because I know how it feels to be in that position of not really knowing yourself I didn‚Äôt and will never."
"Our middle son also served. Before we adopted him he was probably on his way to prison.  He us now a cybersecurity expert. He has advanced computer skills, a wonderful wife, and 3 great kids. He has done several tours all around the world. You shouldn't play football, you might get hurt. You shouldn't be a farmer, you might get cancer from the chemicals. Before you judge, take a second to reflect"
"For me, blowing a guy was more of a confirmation that I like dudes than any other thing.  It feels amazing.  And having one, and being able to put one in your mouth...just amazing.  My favorite part is when they start pulsing and dripping, just before they lose it.  You can keep a guy going for a really long time if you learn just when to let him rest.  So much fun!"
I want to throw up
Give her some time to process what you have just told her. You may already know that you‚Äôre gay for quite some time now. For her it may feel very unexpected.
hairy forearms are my fetish
"I've never been big into hookups just for this reason. Everytime a guy messages me on an app asking if I want to fuck I immediately look the other way, even if I found them attractive. Like, can you at least make a little effort to get to know me first? I'd rather jerk off than have an awkward lifeless hookup lmao.
Sex is fun, but there is so much more you can get out of a person than just that. Plus sex is alot more fun when you are both getting along and are comfortable with each other."
"&gt;If you disagree with his political positions, you should fight him on a intellectual platform, not attacking his sexuality.

Except he spent his whole political career attacking gays' sexuality. Outing is appropriate when someone is fighting against gay rights and also taking advantage of the rights gays have fought for and won. Leaking his nudes isn't so good, but I'm having a hard time finding any sympathy for him knowing what he did to harm my legal rights."
"Don't worry. 
Soon you will be old and ignored like everyone else."
"Gay culture can be for everyone. The scarce and limited gay *social spaces* we have carved out for ourselves are for us. 

The purpose of a gay bar is to give gay people a space where we can assume everyone else there is gay. When the gay bar is overrun by well intentioned straight people, to the point where the gay patrons have to use gaydar, it can no longer serve its original function. Because of this, ‚Äúbeing respectful‚Äù often means staying out of the bar unless invited by a gay friend. 

That said, this depends heavily on the vibe of the specific bar. A crowd dance club with drag shows is very different from a dark sleazy pickup joint."
