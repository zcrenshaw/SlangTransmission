There's plenty of difficult gay dudes too.
"You both could just befriend them, that's honestly the best way to make them feel welcome. Actions speak louder than words, and a flag honestly just feels gimmicky."
Ew. Total turn off.
"I know. I’ve been feeling really guilty about being such a shitty boyfriend lately and I never meant to kiss someone else while I was still in a committed relationship. I’m not sure what to say or how to break up with her, but I’ll figure something out. You’re totally right about me wasting her time as long as I’m not sure what I want. 

Thank you; you honestly made me feel a lot less stressed about all of that. I’m in this weird stage right now where all I wanna do is be close to Matt, but at the same time I wanna stay as far away from that as possible. I like him a lot; he really is one of the most genuine people I know and I admire him for his confidence. Now that I know he’s gay, i wonder how I ever missed it. 

I talked to him on the phone a few moments ago and we’ll go out for coffee later today. I’ll keep you posted, if you’re interested :)"
"I can only answer for myself here, but I'd consider it an extremely positive thing, if any of my straight neighbours hung up a Pride flag. Such a clear and obvious show of support would put my at ease, and wouldn't leave me guessing if you're a neighbour who secretly doesn't approve. 

Personally, I say go for it. Great little gesture."
That’s a scam/bot
You can make a religion out of this...
"Shes like this age Gaga, Britney, Madonna, doing controversial shit, weird, and nonsense.

I'm 22, I tried to listen to her, her Bad Guy song is cool, but i was wondering, its not cool because of her singing, its cool cuz of the beat of the song. 
So shes just another idol for teens who wanna feel  indie/underground/weird."
Most people are not rapists.
"I like the duality of being treated like a sex object solely for the top's sexual gratification during sex, and then, post sex, having the top be affectionate, gentle, and cheery as we cuddle, cleanup, and maybe eat or drink together.

I think that gets into roleplaying, which is worth experimenting with."
So he was watching
You must be new to the Internet.
"It might be a little awkward, but you’ll be meeting him in a professional context. I’m sure he’ll keep it professional and you should also. You’re both adults, it’s fine."
"&gt;caucasity

Wtf....."
Yawn. You should get back to your soap operas.
Ask them to clean up before sex? Lol
"This worked for me: Right after fucking, lay on your back for 10 minutes with your legs up. Then go to the nearest kindergarten and steal a kid."
Woah salty mama
You did nothing wrong. So..... I guess you're in the clear.  Meanwhile your BF seems to have some real trust issues and a poor self esteem.
Y’all can’t go five seconds without insinuating this fantasy lmfao
"When I came out as bi I thought it would be so much easier to date men, however, the reality is that each sex presents it’s own challenges to the point I’d say they’re equally challenging."
"don’t kiss them, simple as that.

no one is forcing you, nor should they be"
"I can't imagine anyone staying for the dialogue. Some of it's so downright low effort, I can't imagine anyone being able to hold back tears of laughter long enough to get hard."
"&gt; Am I the only...

No."
...gay dudes aren’t easy to deal with at all
"It's weird, just say ass."
Lube?
School books.
Strip down to your jock strap and wait outside his apartment door on your hands and knees. If you feel big hands grab your ankles and drag you inside then you'll know.
"Maybe ask the next time, “why don’t so many of you clean up before sex?” See what kind of answer you get. I’m sure it’ll go well."
"It’s precisely the perfect size, obviously."
"This is super helpful, thank you! Yes, I’d say my weight is pretty much stable or up just slightly. I’m definitely seeing an increase in the amount I can lift."
"Bro, it’s pretty clear that you need to break things off with this girl. It’s a waste of her time to be with someone that isn’t crazy about her. As for you, it sounds like a real and natural attraction you have to this guy “Matt,” so don’t overthink it and just got for it. 

Read through this sub and look at all the posts from guys who are gay or bi and really looking for a connection but instead get used for sex right off the bat. Instead you seem to have his cute and genuinely fun/nice guy interested in you. You don’t realize how lucky you are. Don’t worry about whether you are gay or not, labels can come later. I’m rooting for you!"
What causes heterosexuality? It's so out of control and threatening the survival of our planet.
"You need to stop thinking and just accept the bloody compliment, that's what I think."
"yeah you're fine. if he chooses not to accept your explanation, that's on him."
Let's fight for the title of Reddit's #1 bottom.
"Alan Turing, because I can now type this in on my device."
"&gt;I have had people I met on Grindr meet, and change their minds at the last minute.

Even if the intention was to meet for sex, either party is allowed to back out at any time. Sometimes you end up not feeling it when you meet someone in person, and that's okay. If you are actively dating or seeking a hookup, you have to put some time and effort into it. A meetup that didn't go that great isn't him wasting your time, just part ways peacefully like an adult instead of telling him to fuck off."
That’s not how it works. Sorry to tell you but your bf has to carry the baby.
"As long as the plates keep getting hevier, you are getting stronger. I would only worry about it if you begin to stall or if your strenght progression gets significantly slower."
"I consider it an asshole filter. The narcissistic personality can't handle not being in control of others, and certainly has no comprehension that another person could interact with an app in a different way than they do. Some people have to tap/woof/whatever in order to even show up on someone's radar. I live in an area where I may only show up on a couple people's nearby grid: I tap in order to even be seen."
spare me the clickbait bullshit into a hidden url
"I see the tap as similar to a swipe. Or like on scruff, the “I’m interested” feature. 

If I get a tap, and I find the person who tapped me attractive or interesting, I’ll message them “thanks for the tap!” Then the ball is in their court to message me back. If I don’t find the person who tapped me attractive or interesting, I just ignore it. No harm, no foul and I don’t have to reject anyone by direct message."
No one is that powerful. lol
""" I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians."""
"I'm annoyed at the idea that they still think it's an oedipus issue and therefore, a psychological problem."
"You're fine.

The concern he has was unvoiced.  Are you going to be sexting someone else?  Luring boys on grindr?  Obviously not, but say that outright.  There isn't another boy, you were just being vain, and while he might've appreciated them you were still a little shy about the whole thing.

Moreover, if he doesn't believe you -- ask him ""What can I say that would allow you to trust me?""  Ask earnestly, not like an accusation.

It sounds like he's already made up his mind instead of giving you the benefit of the doubt, and if that's the case then he should just stop asking questions if he doesn't like the truth.  Hell, offering your phone up for inspection might not even help if he's self-convinced you'd delete anything bad prior to letting him see it."
"Speak for yourself. None of my gay friends or acquaintances would assume that a relationship is open by default, even the ones who enjoy hooking up. I guess OP is basing his experience on Grindr and things like that.... so OP, stop looking for men at the wrong places and you can ""gay date"" just fine."
"As an American raised in a catholic family, my biggest act of rebellion as a teenager was taking the crucifix down from my bedroom wall."
"Yeah, I don’t think the friend himself is the issue.  He just has issues with men in general, and he’s projecting."
"Find someone you know well and care about, and go ahead and lose your virginity."
“ It’s your choice who you want to be with or sleep with within your spectrum of sexuality”.
It's called being an adult. You should try it sometime.
"The most recent (and popular in the states) explanation is epigenetic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic_theories_of_homosexuality

It seems to me that Europe is still more focus on psychological explanation (in the very first years of life, Oedipus and all that jazz), but that's maybe just an impression."
nope. nothing wrong with being a Christian.  very atheist here.
"When one is attending ""Gay College"" there are several things one must bring, otherwise you will not pass Gay college and will be forced to suffer through living life as a boring straight douchebag celebrating wedding anniversaries and work in an office.

Here is what you need to bring with:

Every album by: Cher, Madonna &amp; Lady gaga.

Condom's Lube, vibrator and poppers....Oh and extra batteries.

Your parent's credit card if available

several dozen pairs of Boxer Briefs

Pencils, Pens and paper for class

Plenty of towels.

"Relationship
I want to suck dick everyday"
Do whatever you want to do without thinking about labels.
It's too late now.  Roomy's curiosity will consume him.  I've seen this before.
They HAVE to be organic
They taste great and are healthier for you than non-vegans.
"Oh, hoood', that's sooo lazy trolling..."
"He said *gay* college... so, like, glitter, high heels and feather boas. You know, what's in your closet."
"Not interested, thank you!

:)"
"Its the only option, you wont be wasting theirs times and wont be wasting yours. Pure, simple and polite."
I'm assuming the sex wasn't that good if you were spending time looking at the wall!
"My first relationship lasted several years before I ended it. It’s going to continue to be hard because not only were you with him for a pretty long time, it sounds like he was your first serious relationship. When that ends that takes a toll. I still think about my ex nearly 6 years later, and I’ll probably continue to think about him but I’m happy with my life now and it doesn’t hurt to think about it anymore. It’s more just curiosity and hoping he’s doing ok."
Or....  really GREAT if all he did was look at the wall.....
"BITCH

You didn’t have to expose me like that 😂"
Agreed! But cut the girlfriend loose if you’re going to pursue this.
"I maybe get a 10-20% response rate when I initiate.

Of course, this is much higher today because I initiate fewer conversations overall now than I have in the past where I was messaging guys WAY out of my league and would get maybe a 2-5% response rate.

I respond to everyone I match with on Tinder, but on more open apps, it's more like a 10-20% response rate when they initiate.

Some guys I just have zero interest in, even to respond with ""not interested"" since that sometimes opens up unwanted drama when they get defensive or retaliate back with an insult."
"Exactly! OP is just selfish and mad because he's a strict bottom and only thinks he's entitled to be a bottom, everyone else needs to be a strict top or versatile but prefers to top"
"I'd say shorts are totally acceptable in the summertime as long as you're not going to a fancy restaurant or something.

just relax as much as you can and be yourself. a first date is about getting to know each other... talk about friends, hobbies, work, what you're looking for, etc.

if you're drinking, make sure that you don't drink too much (both so that your judgement isn't impaired and so that you don't embarrass yourself)

don't get too bummed out if there's no spark. in the course of your entire dating life, you're going to go out on a *lot* more first dates than third dates. expecting every one to lead to true love is a good way to get burned out... just expect to enjoy another guy's company for a few hours."
It's actually an imaginary daddy.
"Well, doing well for a recomp, but not for true bulking where the goal is to gain weight and put on mass by lifting harder using the extra energy you're consuming."
"Let me tell you, I’ve broken off several hook ups when we were already in bed and naked and never once have I been raped."
No?  I can call it what I want.
Yes keep us posted! Hope it works out for you :)

"Define ""not eating enough"".  If you're getting over 1g of protein per pound of body weight and your strength is going up then you are successfully recomping, which morons like Scott ""I've never had a six pack"" Herman don't even believe is possible, so enjoy being a unicorn.  What is your body weight doing?  Is it stable?"
"This was my bottoming fantasy until you said he was only 6'3"".

I'm never gonna have a man who can manhandle me. 😭

Honestly? I wish i could have kept what belonged to me. I don't care about others but I am very sad that i couldn't make the decision for myself. Plus here in Germany i feel like I am the only cutted boy in the whole country.
Basically means avoid
It's cringy as fuck. Total mood killer
"I don’t know what age group you’re referring to as young. I’m under 30. I don’t really like it although it hasn’t really happened to me personally, but I’ve seen it in videos. I know it’s mostly just supposed to be dirty talk, but to me it kind of feels like the top is trying to make what he’s doing seem more masculine because he’s insecure about having gay sex. Also if I’m gay and have no sexual attraction to women, a vagina—while perfectly normal and lovely in its own way—is NOT what I want a mental image of when I’m having sex. Also the term “bussy” is especially gross to me for some reason."
Like it's the taboo that's hot. I'm sure most people who enjoy incest porn wouldn't wanna touch anyone in their family.
Same for me coming from a catholic South Indian family. Like my family isn’t even all that religious but in my living room there are 37 (I literally counted) different photos/statues spread over 2 shrines and a dedicated wall lmao. I used to have like 6 pictures of Jesus and Mary in my room until like 2 years AFTER I became an atheist. I fully agree that it’s more superstitious and a sense of keeping traditions going.
"You're definitely into dudes, or at least this guy Matt, and you're definitely not into your girlfriend. 

Are you gay? Bi? Brosexual for Matt? Who knows, who cares!

It's clear you should break up with your girlfriend before things go anywhere further with Matt. 

She doesn't need to know you're working on figuring out your sexuality. You should just say that it doesn't feel right for you, and tell her that it's best to break up. She doesn't need (or deserve) more explanation about your sexuality at this time. (And telling her you might be gay will make her feel all kinds of awful on her own)"
"Yeah. About the parent thing... If you start feeling like you probably are bi or gay or curious and you think you would like to try something with a guy or with guys, at some point you’re going to have to take into account that the more open you become about those facts, the more likely they are to reach your family. I’m in no way advocating that you should hide who you are from anyone, but if family rejection is a possibility, you may need to work out how dependent upon them you are and how independent you need to become in case the worst case scenario happens and they refuse to support you in any way if and when they find out. But there are lots of resources that can help you navigate that really tricky situation. So I guess what I’m saying is, explore your feelings, figure out who you really are inside and what you really want out of life and love, but be mindful of the fact that your family may not be supportive if and when they find out you aren’t Mr. Perfect Straight Christian Boy if indeed you aren’t. I really hope their love for you would overcome their anti-gay beliefs, but you just never know and that’s a scary situation to be in. Still it’s more important to let yourself be happy, whatever that looks like, than to deprive yourself of experiences or relationships that would make you happy just to keep your family happy. Hope that makes sense. Best of luck!"

"Doesn't matter about sticking labels on things. Maybe you're gay. Maybe bi, pan, demi who knows.

You obviously would much rather be with this guy than with your current girlfriend. I know it's tough to break things off but you'll be SO much happier moving forward if you do."

"Yes, he was my first serious relationship. And I feel exactly the same. I'm letting the thoughts pass by while brushing them off at the same time, but I'm ways hoping he's doing okay and taking care of himself. I told him not to worry about me, but to take care of yourself and your family."

Seriously? Why these questions all the time. We all have different sized dicks. It’s irrelevant what someone else has because it wont change yours. Learn to rock yours and quick comparing-it will only make you crazy.

"Eurovision promotes what countries send. Countries send what their people want to send. So if people send garbage then we have garbage.

41 songs took part this year. Out of these songs, there hasn't been a single song you liked? If no, then it must be so hard to live with such a limited taste. If yes, then did you vote for it?

If songs you like don't do well, it's not Eurovision who's to blame. It's the people voting. It's like blaming the whole country because your party lost an election.

In my personal opinion, garbage is what I hear on the radio and what trends on Spotify and Youtube, at least 80% of it. There have been some artists in Eurovision who have more talent in their one finger than Justin Bieber or Ariana Grande will ever have."
"If you aren't judging people for their beliefs, then what in the heck *are* you judging them for? Their hair?"
"You  can't just generalize it.

"We love it - but it's difficult to explain why? 

Its camp, funny and lasts for hours. You can easily make drinking games of it (take a shot every time a certain country gets points etc). We have EV parties with food and drinks from the different countries so it appeals to by 'hostess with the mostess' side. 

It's just an annual ritual - kind of like secular christmas - i.e. noone takes it seriously but it's fun so you end up doing it every year."
"I don't know if you've noticed this, but in the lesbian community, a lot (not all) of femme women don't mind dating masculine women. I truly believe this is because we live in a misogynistic society where it's ok for women to be masculine but it's not okay for men to be feminine, and I believe that gay men at a young age internalize feminine = bad and therefore are turned off by fem guys. I feel like within the next hundred years, this will change, because it is slowly starting to be okay for men to be more feminine."
"I like when the top is verbal, especially when he whispers in my ear. I'm not sure how submissive your husband likes to be, but I like power tops who hold me down and go really fast and hard. I also like when they're passionate and hold me close. Missionary is nice for eye contact and kissing. It's also more comfortable for me. I also appreciate when the top tries to lube up properly. I like larger built guys myself too, so idk about having a ""thinner"" top. I like feeling like the guy is so much more powerful than me. Post-sex snuggling is very nice too, especially when he tries to get me to climax when he does too."
"Are you saying you don't want to see him again?

"I've never dated a guy as masc as me, despite that being my preference.  If he loves me to death I don't care how femme he is."
"""Problem"" is not really the idea in the first psychological theories... ""Result"" (a psychological result) would be a more accurate word - Freud himself (whatever we can think of him) didn't think it was a problem/disease, and refused to ""cure"" homosexuals, saying they had no problem and just had to learn to be happy as they are.

I have, like a lot of people, big doubts on psychoanalytic theories (at least the freudian/lacan theories), because they can only be proved by themselves. But at the opposite, the US rejection of anything which can happen in the mind, and their urge to find a reassuring biologic reason for absolutely anything, seems also a little childish to me. The obvious way sexuality conforms to cultures and periods (and the changes which go with it: desire for overweight people or not, existence or not of the notion of homosexuality/heterosexuality...) makes any ""all-biological"" theory a little illusory in my opinion.

EDIT : oh and if you wiki a bit, you discover that all the history of the discovery of DNA is almost only the result of European researches : Miescher (Switzerland), Kossel (Germany), Levene (USA, that's your one), Astbury (UK), Koltsov (Russia), Griffith (UK), and Brachet (Belgium).

I'd just be friendly and let him know I'm in a relationship now.
"A quote from Gandhi.  A man who sent out his followers to deface the tens of thousands of Hindic memorials that had gay romantic and sexual imagery in depiction.  A man who had his adult son seized and forcibly castrated when the son would not join him in his celibacy campaign.  A man who persecuted gays, even though he had indulged a multi decade relationship on the down low with a German man (the letters are still in existence).

This is probably the last man in the world that a gay should quote."
"My first experience was with a good friend, who I ""seduced"" and who let me think I'd actually seduced him.   It was sweet, gentle, slow, passionate.   The kissing went on for the longest time, we blew each other, kissed a bunch more, cuddled to sleep, woke up at 3am or so for round two, cuddled and slept then showered together and went out for breakfast.  I will never forget and am so grateful that my first experience was like that."

"Literally only strict bottoms like yourself are the ones that say shit like this, because you're mad that 60% of the gay male population arent strict tops to satisfy your anal penetration needs. Yesterday you said that gay men claim to be versatile only to say they prefer to bottom at the moment, CAN YOU BLAME THEM?

Just be honest with her. That doesn't mean you need to come out to her though. 

You have said that you don't think you do or ever have loved her. How long have you been together? A year? 2? More? Just tell her that you aren't in love with her but you want her to be happy and you know that it isn't fair to either of you to keep things going. In the long run, she will start to feel that you don't truly love her. 

You can talk about how you weren't sure until now. But really it is going to suck but it is better to end something now that isn't going somewhere good"

"No, don't"
"Thank you. Honestly the lightheartedness of your comment made me feel a lot better about myself. I think I’m definitely attracted to Matt in some way, and that probably makes me not as straight as I’ve always thought I was. I’ve never felt this way for anyone, so it’s a little overwhelming. 

I agree with the GF part. I feel really guilty knowing I kissed someone else while I was with her. I’m not sure I’m ready to accept I kissed a guy to someone else out loud yet, and I’m afraid my parents will hear of that, but I’ll definitely talk to her. 

Thank you so much!"

You’re right though. I haven’t been happy with my relationship and what I’m doing is not fair to my girlfriend either. I feel terrible that I’ve basically cheated on her. 

Thank you!"

In that case try a Mach 3 instead of the ones with more blades. Closeness of the shave is also affected by what you are using on skin. Foams and gels create a barrier between skin and blades. Try Dove bar soap and make sure moisturize after.

"Every day? Prob not the best idea. 

The body needs rest. You are not superhuman. Anyone who says you gotta do a million things EVERY single day is an idiot. 24-48 hours rest is essential for those torn muscles to recover. 

If you're doing it EVERY day, you're not gonna get the results you hope for, and you'll overtrain and risk injury. Take a break, bro :o"

"I was a reasonably attractive guy living in NYC in my early/mid 20s.

mostly, I just liked meeting people and going out on dates. I worked weird hours and didn't get to hang out with my friends very often, so it was great finding guys willing to grab coffee at like 10 am on a Tuesday or going to the beach at midnight on a Sunday. if we had a mutual attraction and a first date ended up back at one of our apartments, I didn't fight it.

I was pretty active on dating sites like OKCupid and hookup apps like Grindr, and I had a job that was slow enough that I spent like the third of my time at work browsing them."
"Hmm... interesting.

What would you consider a minimum to getting over that threshold of friendzone consideration if touching at the very beginning of the date was a no-go?"
This sucks SO. FUCKING. MUCH.
I hear /u/surfingdolphins eats a lot of chicken.
12 partners? You’re only just begun.
Damn. I’m really sorry. But I really do appreciate knowing I’m not alone and feeling validated through all of this.
"closure is not something granted by others, it's something we give ourselves. lots of people will unfortunately fail to own up to their actions, and instead decide to be hypocritical and deflect the blame on you. you'll drive yourself crazy trying to get them to do the right thing. 

keep him blocked, and try and move on with your life. it's likely he's dealing with internalized homophobia and in denial about his sexuality, so he wants to blame you instead. those are his issues to deal with. not yours."
"We can only hope they're accepting.  I have seen one guy post asking how he can make his partner with that fetish enjoy it more, and how he can be more accepting and comfortable with his partner's fetish."
"Yes, but if I understand well what you mean by that, its not contradictory, no?

Psychology has always an effect on biology, and vice versa (depression would be a good example)."
"Luckily (if you have one), I think foot fetishes are among the more popular fetishes.

"It used to be that an entry couldn't be an already commercially successful act in the charts, so it attracted kind of cabaret- or all-inclusive-holiday-resort-level talent which tends to be hilariously camp and unpolished. In the 60s and 70s particularly, as disco took off, many entries were disco acts and this attracted developing gay guys who were likely watching at home with their parents. The songs tended to be quite emotional, love-sick and heart-rending, some lyrics may even have subtly hinted at the plight of repressed sexualities or in more light-hearted numbers, encouraging being oneself and having a good time. 

Then you have the phenomenon that continental Europe's taste for chart music is just ever so slightly behind that of say the UK and US, and still harks back to disco and divas with all the pomp and grandeur that come with those. The tunes are danceable and the acts sing their hearts out, it all ends up being very flamboyant, and an enjoyable unpredictable escape for many people. 

Another aspect is that until very recently we didn't really know what entertained our European neighbours in terms of music, TV etc so it was a brief annual glimpse at other cultures. Again this strengthens the resolve of society's less celebrated subgroups and empowered them to not feel so isolated. 

In 98 it was hosted and filmed here in the UK, in Birmingham, and by that point it was a well established gay culture thing - watch parties for Eurovision have been a thing here since the 80s, my elder gay colleague tells me. The TV cameras panned across the studio audience throughout the broadcast and the whole continent got to see that the audience was almost entirely not-at-all-shy gay men. 

It has kind of snowballed with lesbians, drag queens and and transgenders being entries or even winners in years of late.

"My ideal guy is around my age (23), he's slim and in shape but not toned (something like between twink and twunk). He's just a little bit taller than I am (1.72 m or 5'8""). He's light-skinned but not pale. He has dark eyes and dark hair. He's not hairy or not too hairy. He has nice hands and nice feet. He has a cute and hansome face. His dick is between 15 cm to 18 cm (6"" to 7"") in lenght and his girth is average or whatever that can stimulate my prostate. He's either vers or vers-top."
i 100% agree. I grew up in an average Mexican household so every room basically contains something spiritual. It’s definitely more cultural rather than full on religious.

You care way too much about what they will think of you. Feel comfortable and they will feel comfortable as well."
"You’re totally right of course, but it feels weird not knowing what I’m into. I mean, it’s me. I should know myself, shouldn’t I? It’s so strange that I’m suddenly feeling attracted to this guy I’ve only just met a few months ago. It stresses me out not to know what I am. 

I’m not sure if he thinks I’m straight, to be honest. He seemed to pick up on me being confused or overwhelmed when he told me he was an atheist. It was in the look he gave me, like he knew something I didn’t. Or maybe that was just my imagination, I don’t know. What I am sure about though is that he wouldn’t ever pressure me into doing anything; the way I know him, he’s one of the nicest guys I ever met.

I’ll talk to Matt about what happened later today, when we’re going out for coffee. I’m really nervous about it.

And you’re right. I’ll need to talk to her, too. Someone in an earlier comment told me it wasn’t fair to stay with her if I felt that way, and they’re right. I’m figuring out a way to break up with her."
"Ok, so let me just tell you a little about me. I started dating someone before I came out to anyone (except him obviously) then I started telling my very closest female friends. Then I started telling a few of my closest male friends. Then I told my siblings. Then I was pretty much open about it with everyone... except my parents. It took me years to get up the courage to tell them and when I finally did, they could not have reacted in a better, more genuinely loving way. I’m not saying that will be your experience—it very well may not be. But a big part of the process of getting up the courage to rip off that final band-aid was feeling accepted and loved by the other people in my life who already knew. So I started small and sort of built up to it and it took years. In retrospect I wish I had done it sooner but at least they reacted the way they did. I don’t think it’s something you should necessarily rush into—you need to be ready, especially ready in case their reaction is less than ideal—but you also don’t need to put it off forever."
"I feel like 7"" isnt THAT big. Like sure its a couple inches bigger than avg but its not like its 9”. My dick is 7” too and its never been a problem tbh"
"Thank you so much! I hadn’t even considered her talking to my parents if I told her why I was breaking up with her. That’s very helpful and sensible advice.

I do think there may be feelings running deeper than friendship there, and it’s exciting to feel that way because I don’t think I ever have. He makes me feel really out of my depth sometimes and I’m usually a pretty confident guy. I don’t know, it’s weird. So I’d agree I do feel attracted to him in some way. 

I do definitely think that my parents are homophobes. I can’t imagine talking to them about what I’m feeling and I don’t think I will admit to maybe being not as straight as I always thought anytime in the near future.

Matt isn’t the type of person to push someone to do something they don’t want to do, I think. He’s a very genuine guy and he always makes an effort to make sure everyone’s feeling their best. I mean, he dragged me along to parties with his friends when I didn’t know anyone apart from him and he stayed by me side the whole time and his friends speak very highly of him. 

I am feeling overwhelmed by my feelings right now — mostly because I don’t know for sure what they are or what they mean — so your advice is really helpful, thank you! I’m not sure I’m ready to think about anything sexual with him yet but I think I want to talk to him about homosexuality to try and understand my feelings better. 

Thank you!"
Or maybe have it open so he can see it
Pretty common to find in religious households. Not weird at all...unless theres a shrine.

"Thank you so much. This is really sensible advice. I’ll meet Matt later today and talk to him about what happened, and I feel really guilty thinking about my girlfriend because I kissed a guy while we’re dating. So, I need to talk to her, too. God. 

Thank you!"
"I'm glad you're getting coffee! That makes me happy.

I'm 28 and have known I'm into dudes since I was probably 12 or 13, possibly younger. I'm **\*still\*** learning what and who does and doesn't turns me on.

Don't overthink it--just go with your gut and try not to hurt people along the way. People (and you!) will get hurt along the way despite your best intentions, but that's life."
"Glad I could help!

A few more bits of unsolicited advice: 

1. Take care of yourself first and foremost. Don't worry too much about what breaking up with her will do to her. Staying with her is a lie and will hurt her way worse when the truth comes out. 
2. She doesn't need the full truth now. Tell her in a year when you've got things figured out better, if you're still friends. 
3. If you depend on your parents financially, you should be careful with Matt and make sure you understand why you need to take it slow, in addition to the fact that this is all new to you
4. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable with Matt, and don't be afraid to be honest, but DO be careful"
"I mean, yes. When you put it that way, it sounds obvious, but it’s just really confusing right now. I’ve never felt that way for anyone, least of all a guy. I didn’t even know he was gay when it started (although maybe I should’ve picked up on it sooner).

You’re totally right. I just think they’ll honestly hate me for it and I’m afraid of losing them. I want to do what I want to do, but it’s strange to be confronted with the fact that they might not accept that. 

Thank you so much for your advice!"

"Because trends in porno suck. Is barely considered an art. Their goal is literally title anything they think could shock, and grab your attention.

"Yes. Find ways to challenge yourself and make improvements or find healthy friends or family to give you praise or encouragements. Hooking all the time and looking for validation from Grindr is not only going to make you more depressed, but you won't find validation, you'll just find guys like you looking for the same thing and using each other. I decided to indefinitely delete Grindr some months ago and haven't looked back. I know it's not going to do anything for me so knowing that I don't need it makes me feel better. I get validation for myself from doing things I like and want rather than looking for soulless strangers to half-assed provide it for me.

Another example is if after going to the gym for a while and seeing improvements, praise yourself for your accomplishments. If you look to grindr for this, all you will get is just temporary gratification that will be gone after you are finished."

You are normal and definitely not the only guy going through similar experiences as yours.

Sexual orientation is not black and white as we were told and made to believe. Sexuality is a greyscale of identities, likes and dislikes. Some identify gay. Most identify as straight and an unidentifiable number (because people are ashamed to admit their truth) are bisexual. Bisexuality is the true greyscale of sexuality. Some lean gay, some lean straight and some fluctuate. 
It's not good or bad. It just is.

In terms of your sexuality. No one can prescribe you a label. That is something you have to identify and accept on your own through your own discovery. There may be a chance that you get to be with a guy and it simply isn't what you like after all. Could be just passing curiosity and nothing more. And on the flip side, it could be a lot more and the beginning of your self discovery. 

Either way, don't fight it. Don't be ashamed by it. You are uniquely you. And the only person that needs to accept that is you."
I don't care. Means nothin to me.

"I’m an atheist who’s got Jesus crap. There’s a cross that a friend gave me and my ex as a wedding gift. At the divorce, he didn’t want it. I have hanging on it, a rosary that his mom used when she was alive. I loved that lady, and having it there reminds me of what an incredible woman she was in life. The beauty of the human experience is that we all get to where we are in different ways, and sometimes it’s valuable to just ask."
"You're right. And as much as it is something I've seen talked about before and didn't take your post very seriously because of it, it's something that people need to be reminded of. Because people obviously still do it, and some aren't aware that they're doing it until they're told directly."

"Vers here. I suppose it's all the other stuff hub does when he's topping me that makes it gold. Kissing my neck, rubbing my back/chest, the odd hair pull or light spank, pulling me closer to him in a bear-hug, playing with my balls or giving me the reach-around etc. For me, the more sensation and closeness the better - but some guys will hate all of the above so my advice would just be to ask your hub what he likes. *hugs*"
"I top better if, while paying lots of attention to the bottom, I primarily think of him as being there solely for my pleasure.  This involves lots of manhandling."
"My favorite position is called ""bulldog"" position apparently, but I like it more cause the top has easy access and he can hold my hands down while in me. But the best part for me is when he whispers in my ears and nibbles, licks, and breathes in them all while still in me. Makes everything wayyy hotter"

"True, it’s very difficult to talk about. We all have our own preferences. I wanted to open up to the idea of this so others who are experiencing similarly to I, can find this post and be informed if not prepared of what’s to come. Thank you for sharing. We all know the saying goes “love is blind” :)."
"First, you’re 22 and in college. This is a time to explore. That is part of what college is all about.  This is a time to start figuring out who you are apart from your parents.

My story in a nutshell. I’m 41 and knew I was gay since I learned the difference between boys and girls. I came from a deeply religious family (preacher’s kid) and while they were not openly homophobic, it was clear that being gay was against God’s plan. So I hid in a closet of denial and shame. I dated girls in High School and college. I was going to make myself straight. I married a girl at 22, had three amazing kids, and stayed unhappily married for 18 years. The last eight was NOT pleasant. Depression and anxiety got so bad I nearly killed myself to avoid the truth that I couldn’t make myself straight.  I’m slowly coming out of the closet. It’s been a long year and a half in therapy. I’ve been through Hell because I didn’t explore and find myself in college.  If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have explored more. Heck I was in a music department where everyone was sleeping with everyone and I missed out.

You need to find yourself. You won’t really begin to get an idea of who you are until you’re 30. Then at 40 you’ll re-examine your life all over again.  I think that is when you really grow up?  I’ll let you know in 10 years 😂

Kid, life is too short to have regrets.  Go find out what makes you happy.  You’ve got the world before you. Make it great 👍🏻"

"I very rarely initiate conversations on Grindr but when I do is usually a 50/50, maybe a little skewed towards non response/block. 

How often do I respond depends a lot on how bored or how horny I am, but I'm usually very selective and try not to waste anybody's time with polite conversation conducive to nothing. Around 10% maybe"
"The couple needs to see a lawyer, in order to see what their options are. Not a family law lawyer but a litigating lawyer. The lawyer will need to see all the emails. Also, contact some LGBT legal advocacy  groups, to see what they say, like Lambda Legal and also the ACLU. Contact your local news media and see if they're willing to pick up the story. In short, apply as much social and community pressure as possible and seek out every legal path you can. The uncles probably won't get their nephew back, seeing as the adoption is finalized, but they can do what they can to ensure something like this doesn't happen to another gay couple."
"In terms of pleasure no, but you can feel the difference between the penetration if you focus on it when it is bareback. Uncut guys tend to have a smoother glide in their thrusts. Like you feel the meat going in and out slightly more than you feel the friction of the motion.

Most people use lube or condoms though, so the difference is so minor, it is basically a no."

I've always found it odd that all animal behavior is explained by biology except for one species.
"Pretty much. There will always be those who think something is wrong with you just because they need something to validate themselves as being better(classic mean girl mentality). I've taken more than a step back and looked at myself. I've come to the conclusion that while I'm not perfect, there is nothing inherently wrong with me but the environment I was in was the problem. Once you remove yourself from said environment life becomes easier and you feel better about yourself. This is true fact."
