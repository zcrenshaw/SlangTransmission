"This may be one of those times when you don't hide your uncertainty and anxiety behind a joke.   Just listen to him.   Tell him you love him.   Tell him you will always support him.   Tell him you have questions, but you will save those questions until another day.   Hug him and thank him for trusting you enough to reveal this important thing."
"Oh thank God, was judging you and him so much before that last sentence"

It‚Äôs not borderline. It‚Äôs sexual assault. It is doing something without consent.
Convert him
"Also, being part of the community doesn't mean that you have experienced mistreatment. There's a lot of people that are lucky to grow up in a nice, accepting environment."
Far more realistic than most of the stories on here
You should have signed on and wished him all the best
Shower together and offer to wash him?  Teach him a thing or two along the way.
"Your parents being lonely because they disown you is their fault, not yours. They destroyed the relationship by disowning you (their choice); you don't ruin the relationship by 'choosing' to be gay.

They probably ask if you have a gf because they're anxious about whether you'll turn out the same, so like someone else said, it's better to deal with it sooner rather than later.

Next time they ask you if your bro's gay, say yes unless you're actually not sure, otherwise they'll continue to be in denial, which is bad for everyone."
Now *that* would've been creepy üòÖ
Brushing and flossing 30 mins to an hour before sex can put you at more risk if the partner has any disesases. Make a regular habit of brushing and flossing so that you don't have to worry of choosing between bad breath or STDs for hookups.
"Oh. My. God- I've never been so relieved in my life. The daily reminder that attraction doesn't excuse being a perv should always come with this kind of daily posts, ahah."
"Yea. It wasn‚Äôt too extreme but I still feel very uncomfortable around a group of many straight guys, even if they are very nice to me. All Thats in my head is that they probably think of me as an annoying faggoty pussy."
or other Carnivals. so many titties at Carnival.
"Yeah, I feel you. I'm only out to my immediate family. I guess I see it as something that's relevant on a need-to-know basis. For example, my colleagues don't need to know, so I'm not out to them."
What the fuck did I just read?
"Don‚Äôt change what you like based on others. Personally, I don‚Äôt mind chest hair at all. Back hair is a massive turn off for me. I will be honest here, I wouldn‚Äôt hook up with a guy with a lot of back hair, but I wouldn‚Äôt randomly tell you to shave it or how to get ride of it. That‚Äôs fucking rude. You do you, man. If it makes you feel good to keep it, unbutton the top TWO buttons."
Thank you for giving me yet another reason to never step foot in Alabama. As if I didn‚Äôt already have several.
"Just my opinion but most of us are starved for non-sexual physical affection. Hell, I even once met a young straight man who had an overwhelming need for cuddles and affection from an older father figure."
If it isn‚Äôt important to him it will only get worse when he gets older‚Ä¶
I thought this post was on that gay bros satire sub tbh
I saw my boyfriend growing through /r/the_donald. Should I decapitate him and shred his motionless body?
"That's not gay culture, that's just gen x and millennials."
"... I do not serve in light mode but if this is the consequence, I am switching to light mode ... Sir"
"Your father seems a bit overwhelmed by your visit  with your husband and is afraid of doing anything wrong it seems. You should try to tell him, that everything's alright and he doesn't do anything wrong right now and that you're happy to see your parents again after such a long time.

Your sister in law either doesn't know you're gay or doesn't care - bot is fine. But your brother... I am so very sorry to hear that he is a jerk to you doesn't even *care*...

But remember: your parents welcomed you and your husband at their home, didn't they?"
Or said ‚Äúany room for one more‚Äù
Make him into a sex slave
The guy doesn‚Äôt even have to be attractive for me to wonder
"*I love the way your hair on the back of your neck stands up when you talk to a cute guy on grindr*

You should send him that."
"GET OUT NOW!
Been in this situation before, he has trust issues now with something you told him about, but wait until the paranoia kicks in when he sees you talking to a male friend.
He doesn‚Äôt trust you, and will try to control you later on.
It‚Äôs not fun.
Get out."
Don‚Äôt expose me like this.
"Smoking is a turn off to a lot of people, however, you shouldn't quit for them. You should quit for yourself."
i think it was sweet that your parents wanted to go! probably a way to show that they support you
Just one thing that boggles my mind. He discovered that he is not bi but gay and his wife is to blame for not wanting to have sex anymore?
Consenting to kissing doesn‚Äôt entitle intercourse but that happens too. Your consent is finite and limited to mutual agreement. You can charge him.
"There are a good number of gay guys who really aren't that into anal and are extremely satisfied with oral, jacking, frott, massges, or various kinks.  Date one of them."
"Wasn‚Äôt invited to brunch on Sunday. I had to work, but they didn‚Äôt know that üò°"
"If your son is about to come out to you, the most important thing is to be supportive of him. Don't worry about making a stupid dad joke, just be prepared to tell your son that you support him and that you will be there for him no matter what."
sorry to hear all of this. Good thing you don't live there anymore.
"I genuinely give up... This guy goes looking for a year and there he lands a man... Some of us have been trying (even trying to not try) and we have nothing to show ...

Congrats bro! Hope he makes you happy!x"
At the bank.
There‚Äôs nothing like that first orgasm
"Hmm, I'm not so sure about telling him that you have questions to ask later.... I think that would put me on edge thinking and wondering what these questions are. But the rest of this advice is solid."
"every once in a while, but never strongly enough to act on it."
"Please don't get rid of your body hair.
And PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, pop that top button ;)"
Ohhh.... don‚Äôt let him go
Did her letter have paragraphs?
"&gt;I was a little hurt to tell you the truth. He's been lying to his wife and me

.... did you expect anything differently from someone cheating on their spouse with you? strange how you have the audacity to feel hurt after playing with fire for that long. ü§≠"
"Of course. We‚Äôre not dead. We even comment on them. But at the end of the day, we have each other.   I think it‚Äôs perfectly fine in a loving, trusting relationship. (We‚Äôre monogamous, if that matters)"
"What you need to remember is that social media gives prominence to those who 

- use it heavily 
- create engaging content
- people who are unusual and therefore ""interesting""

Ordinary guys doing ordinary things isn't that interesting. Most of us (gay or straight) just live in a mundane world, do ordinary things, and have ordinary friends. We work ordinary jobs and have fairly unremarkable hobbies.

Ordinary doesn't create reactions. It doesn't invite interactions online.

So what you're seeing is a very small section of society given far more prominence than usual. It gives the impression that every gay man is fabulous and outrageous.

Don't worry. Just be you. There are many more like you!"
"Define 'first time'. Did it for years before there was an ""end result"""
We are not savages who don‚Äôt wash themselves lmao.
Tell him that's disgusting and creepy and control your fuckin hormones dude. You might be alright with this because he's hot but if he's willing to cross boundaries and invade your privacy with this he's not going to respect the boundaries you don't want him crossing.
"2 step teeth whitening from Crest followed by a thorough rinse with a water pick. I have to admit that as a kid, I didn't brush my teeth often at all. Now I cant go 6 hours without feeling like my teeth are nasty AF..."
"Honestly, this method helped me. My boyfriend taught me to the clean the area as I am cut but still have a hint of smell when I finish shower and I taught him to scrub his feet as he has horrible foot odor. I think it's a win win, you're not offending the other party but the other party gets the que without being embarrassed."
"Can you give me your phone #, so I can make you fall in love with me and tell you you're the love of my life, only to leave you devastated after I ghost you?"
I agree! A 24 year old that doesn't know how to shower properly :/ He doesn't shave or use deodorant
If they can't pick up the signs I don't bother.
"Shower with him again. ‚ÄúDude, watch how I shower and watch how you shower. You know how much longer I‚Äôd suck your dick for if you would clean a bit better? And you want me to eat your ass?‚Äù

You‚Äôre only obligated to be *so* polite. However you phrase it, it‚Äôs much more rude of him to be disgusting in the first place. He‚Äôs gotta learn and you‚Äôd be doing good to teach him."

"‚ÄúMy boyfriend and I j...‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre gay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Ok, so my boyfriend and I...‚Äù

I do it with unwavering confidence.  At this point, I‚Äôve been out about 6 years and my network consists of allies, I‚Äôve done it for a while.  Likely, I wouldn‚Äôt be mentioning it if I thought it would be an issue. It‚Äôs rare that I need to come out to a person outside of close acquaintances or friends, but even so, I don‚Äôt make it an issue.

If you don‚Äôt put up with it, you‚Äôll let me know right then and there.  Where I live, violence isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm afraid of (and why would it be if I‚Äôm casually coming out), but if you choose to make my sexual orientation a negative and continue to vocalize it, I will kindly and diplomatically say there is not a goddamned thing they can change and I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm queer, get fucking used to it."
I didn't know because I consented for the sex but obviously not for bareback
That sounds like pretty cut and dry touch starvation. Gay's being touch starved is common enough for it to he kind of a meme.
I‚Äôm the opposite; I‚Äôm out to my friends and like 1 family member. The rest don‚Äôt know yet.
I was bullied in elementary school because i was pretty feminine. I got called the f word a lot. I even had some of my friends guardians saying i was gay. This is before i truly had any interest in males or females. It continued until i hit puberty and grew bigger than a lot of people and finally punched a few of my bullies. But my experience in elementary school pushed me deep in the closet and it wasnt until college i was able to openly admit to not only others but myself i was gay.
"You‚Äôre the only one. You‚Äôre Supergay, and now the prophecy is fulfilled."
"Be a ""dad"". Don't joke or be a friend or buddy. 

If we you love him, and if you genuinely feel this way, tell him that it makes no difference to him and you will love him and support him regardless. Tell him he is welcome to bring a boyfriend or partner home. Offer to go to gay pride with him.

However, be genuine. Don't bullshit. 

If you have doubts about things, don't raise it with him. Raise it with someone else.

Don't talk about sex or disease.

This will be one of the most important moments in his life. For the first time in his life, he is being honest with you. It's a solemn nd profound thing.

I don't want to scare you, but how you respond will affect your relationship forever."
It might be why I usually get along better with women than with straight men. Though being with people in general can make me anxious.
"I‚Äôm the same way. I‚Äôm introverted, never was really into parties etc, even when I was in college. I have never been to pride. But I also know that I need to experience these things just once in my life so that I will not look back as an old man and say ‚ÄúI wish I had tried that.‚Äù"
"The ‚Äúbut pride blah blah blah‚Äù is some fuckin BS. Conservatives love to hunt for pictures of guys in dildo costumes/the craziest shit and blow it up into madness. Pride is 99% just simple fun and celebration.

Now that it‚Äôs become taboo to be ‚Äúhomophobic‚Äù it‚Äôs pride they go after."
I scroll thru there sometimes to see how the other side thinks. I usually end up pissed or dumbfounded as to how people actually believe this shit.
"This is scary üòî and this was literally rape - and before it‚Äôs too late - PLEASE get on PEP now.

I don‚Äôt want to scare you, but there was this Scottish guy making headlines, he literally stealthed boys and managed to infect 9 people with HIV - while I obviously can‚Äôt pinpoint that on the same guy you met, it‚Äôs still dangerous as, and you need to act."
I just find out why Love Simon is that popular.
Wow your mom seems controlling as fuck. Are you sure she is a positive influence in your life?

Oh and my sister in law knows I am gay.
"Honestly, I was kind of getting into the drama, too."
hahaha...the moment you realise your penis can do more than just pee
$300/year lmao
Being gay is already the ultimate taboo. Might as well do whatever the fuck you want while you‚Äôre being gay.
I have read that the small cuts and tears that can be caused by flossing or harsh brushing can lead to easier transmission of disease
My boyfriend started grabbing and squeezing at my pecs like they were tits  once while we were fucking and oh my God nothing has ever turned me on more without me realizing I was into it before hand
There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to be gay.  No standard.  Just be you.
"I'd suggest keeping it simple.

""I'm glad that you trust me enough to talk about this. You're my son and I love you. Is there anything at the moment I need to know or adjust?"""
OP needs to take the periods from those ellipses and spread them out. I feel like I'm reading the thoughts of a crazy person.
"When I was a sophmore in high school, I had a crush  since middle school back in California. A really hot mexican boy named hugo. We were waiting on the bus for school one morning and out of nowhere he told me that he'd let me suck his dick. It caught me by surprise because it came out of nowhere and I wouldn't have expected it from him. It was a rumor going around school that I was gay (which was true) but I always claimed that I wasn't, I guess he was desperate and really horny at that time (I mean he was a freshman). I laughed, played it off and told him no and that I wasn't like that but ever since then I always thought to myself that I really should've just went for it because he really was hot and was really popular with the chicas (girls), he even had a couple of girl friends later on. Now he's married with a kid."
Tell her to grow a spine and fix her situation or delete her from your life. The situation with your sister is extremely fucked up.
you should be flattered. it is the most genuine and honest compliment a man can give.
If they are saying it‚Äôs for next week I‚Äôd give 75% odds one of them is getting ghosted
"Most gay movies are written to evidence or sympathy for gay people. They aren‚Äôt written for other gay people. As such they often end in tragedy or highlights gay oppression.

I would ignore what other people say as these days there are a lot of people who take delight in being total bitches.   They criticize every one and every thing.    Gay pride like Mardi Gras is a show with colorful and wild costumes designed to get attention.
Oh God that's me
"it's prevalent in the us for lots of reasons, and none of them are based in evidence-based practice. lately this is in decline, but as long as insurers pay for this nonsense it will keep happening. 

it's also prevalent in countries where the religious or social tradition leans this way (so, certain islamic countries and israel). 

just as silly: american men who are all squeamish about foreskin."
It's not borderline. It's absolutely rape.
"I‚Äôm not telling you to do it. I‚Äôm just telling you that you are empowered in this and, perhaps, he has earned a Grindr warning/threat to smarten the fuck up."
Vers is the best way.
I can understand that. Like I have work fiends who don't really know just because it doesn't come up.
It's nice your supportive. Follow your heart. If it feels right go for it
"The majority of my mistreatment has come at the hands of helpful allies who think I need to feel something browsing through Facebook some random Tuesday evening, because some Appalachian pastor said something about gays again.

Sure, there‚Äôs been some genuine shit from genuinely shitty people, but the majority was delivered to my doorstep by people who care for me."
I'm a student if that counts? Studying aeronautical engineering ‚úà
Sounds like you dodged a bullet there mate
The bigger guy is top and the smaller guy is bottom.
"I have very few:

- drug use beyond alcohol and weed.

- wanting to be my boyfriend as soon as we meet, yikes.

- rude to service staff."
Look for a gay support group in your area. Seek them out for advice and counseling. Keep your chin up and stay positive. Be proud that your being honest with yourself and them. They should come around soon enough. Be you!‚ù§üåà
"This is neither unpopular, nor an opinion."
"That‚Äôs just life as a gay black guy tbh, it hits harder because in the beginning there‚Äôs an expectation of ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù and going on dates and meeting guys and everything being better 

Then you realize that ‚Äúit seems‚Äù like most people outside your race aren‚Äôt even remotely interested in you unless your a specific type of big muscled hyper-masculine top... and only then it‚Äôs still just as a passing fetish and still not a large percentage of people 

So now that your dating pool has been cut into a fraction, you have to shift through a small segment of other black guys and if you have high standards you dating pools decreases by another fraction 

That‚Äôs when you just delete all the apps 

You might have more luck at gay bars with mostly black people or in more diverse communities. I recently went to a diverse bar and it was much different than any app experience and it boosted my confidence a lot... there are people out there, you might just have to literally move to a different state across the country. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Having said all that, there are many people within the gay community that will downvote your post and downplay your struggles. It happens every time..."
"Not really. Even avoiding all the social context, and assuming you live  in a perfectly accepting world, it still fundamentally sucks to be gay. Your dating pool is extremely limited. You go to a party. It's midnight and everyone's kinda drunk and tryna get laid. You see a cute guy you wanna approach him. Well there's 95% he's straight. After a bunch of times like that, you learn to actively stop yourself from developing affection. You don't even allow yourself to be attracted to a dude until you know 100% that he's gay. And well there's no way to know for sure, so your main way to meet people becomes Grindr or other app, most of which are slimey as fuck.


And even then, on top of the incredibly limited dating pool, gay guys are way pickier than media would have you think. Those movie cliche made-eye-contact-with-a-guy-then-ended-up-sucking-his-dick-in-an-h&amp;m-dressing-room shit only happens if you're incredibly attractive.

And the worst part is... you never really fit in. Even platonically. You're not one of the girls and you're not one of the guys. No matter how close you are with your heterosexual male friends, they will always be more physically comfortable with one another, than with you. And no matter how close you are with your female friends, they will always have the occasional girls night they don't invite you to.

Truth is, no matter how good you have it, it's inherently lonely being gay. So no, my man, I don't think it's better at all. You're lucky you're straight."
"Sounds like a soap opera. If they're not reasonable people, don't expect to be able to reason with them."
"I don't think people got the joke. 
Or maybe I just didn't get the post."
"Practically, I don't think I can be with someone that requires me to have a stationary approach to my identity. That doesn't work for me. I think that identifying as queer and having feelings for more than 1 gender has gotten me accustomed to not really needing prescriptive rules when describing my gender or my sexuality.

To be more specific, I was assigned male at birth and I'm cool with that. I don't feel like my body does not represent me on the inside. With that said, I don't have anything against wearing a dress. Bitch, as long as I look good. I don't have a problem with expressing emotion, wearing makeup, providing physical and psychological support to people in distress, etc etc. I have ADHD so I loathe team sports, but I do well with sports that rely on 2-4 people max. I'm the designated furniture assembler and mover even though I'm 5'6 and my husband is 6'1.

I don't particularly think that I enjoy doing these things because of something that had to do with my penis. I learned I love ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" activities alike because I tried them. I tried them because I learned to not give a shit about what others expect of me. I learned to not care about others because, as the queer kid, I learned pretty quickly that people would have thoughts about who I was and what I did regardless of the choices I made. I was a bad gay for having feelings for women, and a bad male for having feelings for men. My parents were proud of me for dating a girl that lived on the other side of the continent but worried about me for dating a guy that lived close. If someone is always gonna be mad or disappointed, why it gotta be me? That gave me the mental permission to experiment with whatever I wanted. Masculinity and femininity were among the things I experimented with, and there were aspects of both that I chose to retain.

So that's my reasoning for why expecting heteronormativity would just not work for me. Heteronormativity assumes a stationary gender configuration that just does not work for me."
SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!
I think it that gen x and millennial lgbt are still developing a ‚Äúculture‚Äù that isn‚Äôt based on fear and trying to hide. Since lgbt people are just normal people but we tend to flock together any behavior we have in common becomes part of the ‚Äúculture‚Äù even though we are just doing what everyone else is doing.
That's some faith militant stuff right there... Expect walks of shame.

"Dude, just lie to them. It‚Äôs none of their business anyway. You‚Äôre you and you aren‚Äôt changing, and they can either accept it, or not, and it‚Äôs sounds like not. Do literally just keep the lie up while you‚Äôre still financially dependent on them and when you aren‚Äôt any more then you can make the decision whether or not to be open and honest or not. Do what you gotta do. Also, they can‚Äôt prove shit, so just say you‚Äôre straight and save yourself a plethora of issues."
"Touch starvation is a real thing. Assuming you're american it's probably pretty bad haha. American males are pretty touch starved. If you have them available, find some buddies and just cuddle while you watch a movie or something like that. You don't have to have a dick up your ass to just like lean on somebody or put your arm around their shoulder and just be chill about it. If you're out and gay this is probably easier. Straight or not-out you might face social hurdles but I know a number of straight guys who cuddle puddle way better than other gay friends. Talk to your friends if you feel comfortable. Say ""hey, wanna hold hands just for fun?"" while you're at the mall. Male or female if you're touch starved you should try to treat by having cute, consensual, non-sexual contact. It's easier than you think!"

It‚Äôs actually kinda hot
I kinda disagree a little! I think IF your current relationship is such that you normally would  say a bad dad joke and that‚Äôs why you want to say one here then you should! One of the fears most kids have is that ‚Äúthings will change‚Äù! I think making a bad dad joke will show your son ... nothing has changed! After your bad dad joke than follow the above advise it‚Äôs still very solidüëçüèº

"you should quit for your health.

It's likely a turnoff to many."
"Yea. I was 13, and it wasn't intentional. I was looking at a youtube slideshow with artistic pictures of half-naked on my phone. I got a boner and eventually started rubbing the back of my dick head with my hand cupped. It must have been instinctual somehow. 


It kept getting better and better until suddenly my dick started hoping and twitching. Surprised and sort of scared I stopped rubbing and watched as it slowly erupted with cum. After a couple of seconds, I gathered myself and realised I had just masturbated for the first time. Thought it was cool, cause I'd read about it before and wondered what it'd be like, and how you did it exactly. Now I knew."
It‚Äôs like my true to life story but there was no punching involved. More bjs and kissing. Fun days.
"Some really disheartening comments in here. I personally like being in good shape, because it's one of the few things I have control over. I like to go hiking when I have time, too. I like to think I have a personality."
"I cried a bit, but in a positive way. It made me happy. If it was a bit more realistic, it might have made me envious or depressed, but you can tell it's just a generic teen romance if you remove the gay factor, so it felt fine. Call me by your name on the other hand, that left a void in me for a month."
"absolutely. i couldn't ever be in an actual relationship with a woman, but i wouldn't be opposed to experimenting. sorry for TMI, but i can get off to the though of having sex with a female."
I guess I was 13. I had a friend slerping over. He jacked me off. When I came I really didn't have anyidea what it was.
Is it really gay culture?
Punch it in the head with a huge amount of force.
Yes. Absolutely. I wouldn‚Äôt even date unless I was athletic first.
You‚Äôre response to them asking if your out brother is gay being ‚Äúprobably‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help anyone in this situation. If anything it will make your brothers sexual orientation seem like even less serious of a legitimate thing if his own brother doesn‚Äôt sound like he believes it.
"Totally relate. I don‚Äôt advertise that I am gay, or trans. If someone asks I will be straight up but I‚Äôm a lot more person beyond my gender and orientation."
Well once the years pass and you‚Äôre still gay they will probably get the idea
"I‚Äôd like to add that once you do get him clean, you should reinforce it with statements like ‚ÄúI love it when you smell clean‚Äù or ‚Äúyou taste so much fresher‚Äù.  Make your encouraging statements tied to some sort erotic or romantic thing so it rewards him for the behavior.

I mean he‚Äôs not a dog to whom you‚Äôre teaching a trick but the principle still applies. :)"
"All depends on the situation. 

Im a nurse, and clogs are common footwear even with dudes. I wear sneakers because clogs are comfortable, but clunky for me personally. One day, A guy I work with was talking shit about another guy we work with wearing clogs, insinuating he was gay. It became very evident he had no idea im into dudes.  I waited for him to say enough shit he couldnt walk back before telling him that the other dude is straight and that the real fags in our hospital wear sneakers in front of a bunch of our coworkers. He looked like the asshole. It was pretty satisfying."
"Okay it's one of homophobic part of Europe, but u are lucky your parents atleast welcomed u home."

"Haha not really a occasion to make a move, but i remember my very very first crush on a boy - i must have been 10 yo or something. My parents had friends in an other city, who had two daughters, and it was the birthday of one of them. And among the girls invited, there was a boy, who was so beautiful, i still remember my surprise, with and old style haircut/look, something [like that](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jadensadventures/images/2/20/76473ebc-075a-4c25-85dc-d83f760fd3f7.png/revision/latest?cb=20170518203418). And so much assurance and class, very calm and mature boy... I spent the all day looking at him without understanding why, and the worst is that was he was friendly to me, gentle, but i don't know, i suppose i was scare to connect.

Anyway, 20 years later, i see the birthday girl - we almost didn't see each other since then, like maybe 3/4 times max. We talk a lot, and i casually speak about this one friend, and she says ""oh yes, i loved him so much, he was by best gay friend during teenage years, i don't know what he became, though..."".

I suppose i could have had a very cute first kiss but, hey, that's life..."
"My boyfriend has a wonderfully hairy chest (which I love) and slightly hairy back (which I also love). He seems to hate his own back hair -- he thinks it's gross (he routinely goes to get it waxed off), but personally I have no problem with it and I think it makes him more cuddly."
Unless they're fucking stupid ones
"""If you want X please wash it thoroughly first.""

You're perfectly entitled to cleanliness if they want any sexual favours imo"
The Statue of Liberty can be viewed on a free cruise. It's called the Staten Island Ferry.
"They‚Äôre looking for the imaginary, straight acting, nerdy but handsome, down to earth but cool, confident but humble guy who only exists in rom coms."
"No, you're not alone there brother.
Sometimes I just want to cuddle and sleep and its enough for me. No need to talk, just breath."
"There is so much of this going on out there right now. So many shitty liberals thing they can't possibly be racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/misogynistic  or whatever  because they've memorized Belle Hooks and they're good a performative wokeness. It's infuriating, Intersectionality takes work, both inner and outer, and we can all hold onto shitty attitudes and behaviors if we aren't willing to do that work."
Please don't feel selfish for feeling loss. That is totally valid. Feel your feelings. My grandma just lost her husband. I have been helping her through it. It is just going to take some time.
"Yes, I was bullied for 6 whole years because I was a bit feminine as I was very close to my sisters. Only realised I was Bisexual 6 years later. The bullying haunted me till now and caused me to have low self esteem and social anxiety and the worst thing was, the bully turned out to be gay himself. That made me so angry because he himself was gay yet chose to project that insecurity onto others. However, I decided to do myself a favor and let that shit go cause I deserve much better than that üôè"
"It sounds like he had romantic feelings for you and you just don‚Äôt feel the same way.

Your sexuality or ‚Äúrefusal to accept yourself‚Äù isn‚Äôt the issue here"
"I will defend Pride and it's vital importance to young gay people to the ends of the earth, but personally I do find the sexualisation a bit much. I live in Scotland, and our Prides are generally very family friendly (but still a hell of a lot of fun), and the last one had people of every creed cheering us on from windows and balconies and it was very well received.

When I lived on the continent I was a bit taken aback by the overt sexual displays at Pride. Women with no underwear legs akimbo on the floats bearing all, people sucking dick in the sidelines, and there were children present. I'm by no means a prude, I think children should get appropriate sex education and have a healthy attitude towards sex, but that doesn't include seeing shit they won't understand. Whether that be at gay Pride or Mardi Gras or anywhere else for that matter. It's simply not appropriate.

Yes, Pride is for us, not for ""them"", but it is when we are at our most visible and people will make a judgements of the community based upon Pride. If we want to be taken seriously as a demographic then we need to think hard about how we present ourselves."
"And we‚Äôve been keyed toward a Pavlovian response to it - that visual is almost always used in depictions of unattractive men. Commercials and movie characters featuring unattractive guys in tiny speedos, 1970s sunglasses and a cigar, all with a prominent shot of his hairy back. So similar visuals. We‚Äôve been trained to think it‚Äôs unattractive."
"To quote a previous post of mine:

&gt; Circumcision was never traditionally practiced by (pretty much) any ancient European group. Jews were the main group known by the Greeks and Romans to practice circumcision, and it was considered a defining division between Jews and pagan non-Jews, since it was (and is) a religious obligation for Jews. When the Roman Empire converted to Christianity, the practice of not circumcising was further strengthened because of its Christian theological significance - it was believed that Jesus abrogated or ""fulfilled"" the commandments of the Old Testament, so nobody had to circumcise anymore. Jewish circumcision was seen as a rejection of Christ and an obstinate refusal to give up the laws of the Torah.
&gt; 
&gt; So not circumcising continued to be the norm throughout the entire Christian world for the next 1500 years, including the American colonies of Christian European countries. Circumcision was also a pre-Islamic Arab practice and became deeply ingrained into Islamic tradition, so it was also seen as something that set apart Christians and Muslims.
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that circumcision is so prevalent in the US basically a historical anomaly. It stems from sexual moral panic about masturbation in the late Victorian era (late 1800s). During this time period, some American and British doctors began recommending circumcision in order to prevent masturbation. Of course, it didn't actually prevent masturbation, but by the mid-20th century it had become the norm in most of the US, especially among Protestants. The practice declined in Great Britain after WWII and persists to some extent in other English-speaking countries like Australia and New Zealand.
&gt; 
&gt; Circumcision is also historically practiced by the Bantu and Afro-Asiatic peoples of Africa, many Australian Aboriginal groups, and certain other groups scattered throughout the world."

Lol same. I really dont get how I let my dental health slide in the past. Smfh
I‚Äôve learned to brush comments like that off and just take it that they are naive. I‚Äôm an only child and my family kept saying how disappointing it is for my mom not to have grandkids.
"If you‚Äôre not really into it, fine. If you‚Äôre not into it because you think it makes you less ‚Äúmasc‚Äù, then you‚Äôre a delusional moron."

"Omg, was bullied from like 2nd to 12th grade for being gay but I didn‚Äôt really know I was gay. So was defending this hereto fantasy version of myself until I was 18. Then I finally met a guy that was cool and I was like ‚Äúoh shit, I am gay!‚Äù Wish I would have met a decent guy earlier so that o could have defended myself, actually knowing who I was. It was hard because I grew up being told I was straight. It was the 80s. It was so confusing."

"Or better yet, text him and say ""If you want a nude pic, you just have to ask instead of breaking the law"" (or something like that).

Forget embarrassing him. Some embarrassment will help slap sense into him to stop this dangerous behavior. Embarrassment is nothing compared to the legal consequences if he keeps doing this.

A message like this will get the point across but also say that you're okay letting it slide... this time."
It‚Äôs a huge turnoff for almost every non smoker.
I just get sad. They're my age and they'd look great wearing a bin bag while I base my clothing choices on hiding as much of my disgusting body as possible.
Would you mind sharing how your parents saw it? Would love to know their perspective.
"It works great. You make it loud and clear that it's a minor detail and not relevant to the discussion. If they get hung up on it, you then get to act like they're being weird (because it's 2019, so they are) and get testy since they're distracting you from whatever you were doing."

If he believes it was his fault id bet my scrotum he‚Äôd let you try again and wouldn‚Äôt thrust. Maybe just tell him you wanna practice and could he help you out.
You touched me deeply by sharing this. I'm going to go hug my own DH a little closer now. Thank you for your vulnerability.
# What a groundbreaking observation
"Since I recently got braces I find other 18+ guys with braces Hot for some reason. I had braces at 13 but was too cool for retainers and had to get them again as an adult. At 13 I fooled around a lot with my braces on, some of my partners also had braces. But I didnt find it Hot like I do now."
"Uh, I'm confused.

I was under the impression that older straight men hooking up with, and marrying much younger females (and vice-versa) was common enough to be a stereotype. Several actually: midlife crisis, trophy wife, gold digger, daddy issues, ... The reverse is also common enough. Cougars have been a thing for at least two decades now. So, large age gaps in relationships clearly transcend gender and sexual orientation. What would really be odd, is if gay relationships were somehow immune to that pattern.

The notion that older guys are always the ones initiating (creeps!) is also counter factual. A lot of young guys are into older men, and aggressively pursue them.

Which could help explain why the majority of messages and notifications you receive do - in fact - not come from younger guys. Because you're of little interest to them right now."
I think the joke in this post went right over most of the commenter's heads...
"He got a formal warning and told if they got any other reports of him badmouthing other students he's supposed to be making feel welcome (social society after all) that they would remove him as president and call an Emergency General Meeting to replace him.

In your case, if it's multiple people they'll see it as conspiracy and they'll often deal harsher penalties, since they're ganging up on you"
Is it a cultural thing? Some cultures don‚Äôt do anything that will modify their body scent.
"That was the joke, yes."
"I mean, isnt this essentially how Trump was elected?"
"Me and my boyfriend went to our first pride together this weekend. Our group consisted of our lesbian work friend and her friends. At 1am Sunday morning, my boyfriend looked at me and said ‚Äúthis is prom without tuxedoes.‚Äù

A lot of LGBT high school experiences are fucked and we end up living our high school lives in our 20s. Not saying it‚Äôs good, but I think it‚Äôs universal amongst our community"
Lol had me there for a minute üôÉ
I don‚Äôt blame my parents for the decision because it was most likely just asked and assumed by the doctor that it was to happen. I do feel gypped tho. I definitely am jealous of guys that are uncircumcised

"You might be bi, and it sounds like he may be transgender. Just go with the flow and enjoy yourself. Don‚Äôt worry about labels. Just be good to each other and communicate. Don‚Äôt overthink this."
I'm surprised by this . Spaniards I know are really chill with gays. I guess bigotry can never go away 100% no matter the amount of social progress. Are there any government services you can access to help you get on your feet and start on your own?
Just because someone is gay doesn‚Äôt mean they have to be into the gay scene.
Group of straight guys can be rowdy
What does a drink of bear taste like?  Aftertaste?
I can totally relate! Someone once described it as a Service Top and I have used it ever since!
"didn't ask me, I just think it's aesthetically not that pleasing on the back. I wouldn't ask my partner to shave, but I do think it's more appealing to see the detail in a guys back...back hair seems a bit awkward because of the way it grows. Do you man, what turns one person off is a turn on to another."
yes we both do. also because in the end he loves someone with massive muscles ( something i dont have at all )  and i like a good hairy guy with nice beard ( something he doesnt have) . still we are super happy in love together and share our thoughts on guys. very few times also share the fun times together haha
You could find him.
"I guess I am in that process...

Sure I do miss the way my family was before I came out but I do realize that:

1. Memories are better than history
2. The family you choose will love you so much more than your real family could."
Fantastic. Downside is when I do have to sleep in clothes it feels uncomfortable.
I shoot into the air and catch it in my mouth. ü§™

"Congrats man! I love hearing about people finding a good match, especially since it can be difficult when you are gay. I've had a few short lived BFs, but I feel I'm yet to find a serious one that sweeps me off my feet and I truly fall in love with. Hopefully I will find that person soon!"
"Sorry this happened to you. I used to avoid this by meeting up with the guy fairly quickly - usually within a few days. The risk of ghosting is high and a few weeks of investment is not worth it. But this shouldn‚Äôt happen regardless, I hope things improve for you!"
"I feel you and have shared your fears. The community is a mess. Best you can do is demand monogamy and discuss your goals and interests with your partner. If you let yourself get dragged down by fear and uncertainty you will be unhappy regardless of your orientation. Also, you outlook sounds a bit dated. Many gays these days are domestic as hell. Gay marriage is real and families can adopt. You need to find the right person. Sometimes you will be surprised by who that person is."
Software dev is some sort of engineer :p?
"What you describe seems in fact pretty logical.

You say yourself that you like to feel ""protected and safe"" - older men probably turn you on firstly because of that (they look more experienced, more protective - that's the daddy thing -, more mature, more in capacity to handle you, you can trust them). 

Well, for him, being attracted to younger guys, that's the opposite : when he feels he's ""making you safe and protected"", it's his turn on. Therefore, if you cry, it means he has a role, that he can comfort you, that he can be protective. That's how he's into sex and feelings.

And the same way that your thing for older guys (this need to be protected) can go with a pleasure of being dominated, his protective kink probably goes with some domination stuff (seeing your fragile, in need, dominating you). I remember a guy like that, here, telling us about a fantasy he had to put his lover in a scary situation where it would be very frightened/defenseless, and then to hug him deep and protect him afterwards...

So what you experienced seems perfectly logical to me, even if you had the occasion to see it in a bright light, and that i understand why you're weirded."
What goes on?
Someone told me they loved me before we even met in person.
"If you need the financial support lying and sneaking around till you no longer need it is a possible option. Be you, lie to them and take their money. Then when you graduate tell them the truth. 

Alternatively, start seeking out ways to make money now and a permanent place to live while you put yourself to school. I know both options are pure shit but blame this fucked world we live in :/.

Hopefully your parents ‚Äúsolution‚Äù involves accepting you...hopefully"
"I once saw someone block my profile in real time, that was a fun experience lol"
"I hate to be rude here but I think this is more a PSA for your current and future partners.

This list really comes down to your preferences though. There are other men who like guys cumming down their throats, rough sex, and fingers (yes dirty ones) put in their mouths. It's obviously not your preference but I can tell you there are many gay men that find these acts arousing. 

It would be impossible to create the dos and do nots of sexual intimacy because everyone's lists are going to look different - often times drastically so. 

I think clear open communication is really important, especially in the bedroom, so I don't want to dissuade you from sharing - but perhaps a general audience like this isn't the place to share your preferences. To others it may seem offensive that your kink shaming and telling others what they should or should not be into."
"doesn't put any effort into the first date (not saying a guy has to look like a model in designer threads, but at least shower and wear clean clothes)

"When I went to SF Pride I saw a lot of old dude balls and peen. However at Portland Pride, nobody is naked, which is odd because I'm pretty sure we have a Naked Bike Ride event once a year, so I wouldn't think that people here would be shy."

"Yeah being supportive is the easy part. Poor Sam when we first talked whole wife/feminine thing he was pretty scared and distressed. He‚Äôs a good friend and I think we both care about each other. I feel bad sometimes because all I do is let him make me cum but he keeps saying that‚Äôs all he wants and that he just loves making me cum and wants to do it as many times as I can take it. But I think is him saying he wants to be a girlfriend a hint at me or Something? I want to ask but I also don‚Äôt want to ask, if that makes sense, because I don‚Äôt want to say the wrong thing."
"it's weird how people assume that Muslims must be monolithic on gay rights, even though Christians have all sorts of conflicting beliefs on basically everything.

for every Catholic that has premarital sex and uses contraception, there are Muslims who don't strictly follow their own religious dogma on every issue."
Having anal sex will cause incontinence. Unless you are doing something absolutely insane all the time. I have shits bigger than any human dick and I'm pretty sure everyone doesn't go incontinent from the million shits they take in their life.
Your girlfriend turned you gay. I've always said that chicks are dangerous.
"Go to a different doctor. That one obviously didn't listen to you.  In the meantime, if you really like the guy, tell him what's going on. He'll understand"
"There are very different standards when it comes to body odors in the US vs many European countries. 

Europeans complain Americans smell ‚Äúoverly perfumed,‚Äù ‚Äúreek of chemicals,‚Äù etc. Americans find Europeans to be overly ripe, especially in summer. 

European countries are less likely to have AC, most are less likely to use antiperspirant (rather than deodorant), less likely to use heavily perfumed detergents, more likely to re-wear clothing several times. As a result, body doors are less culturally offensive in many European countries than in the US.  

I‚Äôm an American and I lived in Europe for 8 months. I‚Äôve been to 12 European countries and have hooked up in most of them. Europeans do find body odor generally less offensive than Americans, and the negative feelings about it do wear off. 

It‚Äôs very country specific though. All countries are diverse and have a wide spectrum of bathing and hygiene habits."
I know where he lives too but I don't know if something will come from it.

Don‚Äôt stop walking and if you do go over to the side and put your back against a building.  Just stay out of the way because people will push you.  If you bring a backpack move all the zippers to the right side so that you can quickly feel all them to make sure nobody‚Äôs opened them and taken anything.

Got a great laugh when I got to that line lmao
"I think you can't really connect, anyway, with someone you don't find intelligent. I mean, any kind of ""intelligence"" : theoretical, intuitive, ingenuity, manual dexterity, some weird and good reflexes, humor, a capacity to take the good decision at the right time... Anything, as long as you can admire it in some way. If you look at the guy you date from above, it's really hard to feel anything for him, even attraction."
I mean it sure beats the 40 min blowjob I gave yesterday.
"I became super independent at around 11 when I realised I was probably gay..

"&gt;He was an AIDS researcher for 14 years, and now he's convinced that queerness and AIDS are the same thing, and all gay men are predators trying to spread disease.

No offense to you, but he doesn't seem like a very good researcher. It actually sounds like he was playing a part in some kind of homophobic propaganda."
"All that matters is that you exercise, not whether your body reflects that in muscle mass."
"&gt; even convinced myself it was nothing

The idea that you needed more than ten to fifteen minutes of dry humping and pinning and disrobing to realize he wanted it - this made my morning. Dude tried to smash the locks off your closet door.

But yeah. There've been a few. One texted me years after high school, drunk, asking me a whole list of gay sex questions and wondering why I'd never made a move. Was he not hot or...?

Another guy was in a yoga class with me. We were the only two men, so during partner exercises we always teamed up, because I dare you to be partners with one out of fifteen women. Once, I was in Child's Pose and he was rubbing his hands on my back, telling me to relax, 'cause my muscles felt tense. I goddamn melted."
"If you want to, just tell her you‚Äôre down. Make a grindr and put ‚Äústraight guy wanting to suck cock in front of gf‚Äù You‚Äôre gonna get 40 guys wanting to in 20 min tops

"People grieve in different ways and at different paces. However, if this is affecting you after 10 years, I think seeing a grief counselor is worth a try."
"I‚Äôve never understood this argument. They‚Äôre acting; they‚Äôre playing a character. I agree with your sentiment that gay actors shouldn‚Äôt be relegated to minor characters and caricatures, but the problem isn‚Äôt who is playing what, it‚Äôs the roles available. Your argument implies that gay actors can‚Äôt play straight characters as well as straight actors (since sexuality determines fitness for roles) , and that is a really harmful implication. There is and difference between actors and roles.  

Discriminating who can play what roles isn‚Äôt going to help anyone. It just makes it harder for some of these stories to be told. A while ago, there was this movie that cast Scarlett Johansson as a trans character who was the lead in a movie. There was such an outrage about how a trans actor wasn‚Äôt cast that the movie was cancelled. Instead of making a positive change for trans representation, the outrage prevented a potentially really important story from getting told, which would have the draw of a high-profile actress. 

Imagine if they applied that same attitude to Moonlight. My friend was telling us this story the other day about how she was talking with her mother about this movie and ended up coming out as bi when trying to explain how much the movie affected her. She said it was a beautiful moment where they started crying and hugging and it was like a weight was lifted off her shoulders. Had people argued that the movie shouldn‚Äôt have been made because the lead actor isn‚Äôt gay so he can‚Äôt play a gay character, or that Janelle Monae couldn‚Äôt play her character because she‚Äôs queer irl but the character is straight, it‚Äôs very possible the movie could have not made as big an impact or just fallen apart completely. 

Sorry for the rant, but this kind of attitude makes it harder for important stories to get told and to reach a wide audience. I think we have a long way to go in regards to LGBTQ+ representation in media, but this kind of discrimination is not the answer."
Agree. Maybe let's not support the dudes in our community who do shit like this
It is hard to control myself when a guy kisses/licks my neck. It just sends shivers down my whole body and I could probably cum just from that if it happened for a bit of time
Are you dependant on your parents right now?

"This was certainly an interesting outcome. I hope your friend gets his life sorted. But his struggles will probably continue for a bit. Good thing you're still friends. But be prepared that any retaliation from his wife might get directed at you. She certainly has a right to be emotional about it. Hell, the dynamic all three of you lived in as described by you was not exactly healthy. Less so for some than others of course. I just hope all's well that ends well."
