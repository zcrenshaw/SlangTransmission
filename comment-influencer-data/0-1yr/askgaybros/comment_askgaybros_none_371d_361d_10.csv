"Usually, it's the case where I'm horny as fuck and jerking it while thinking all these horny thoughts that the second you cum, you realize how dumb it was. Like, wanting to fill a shot class with your cum and drink it. Came in the glass then thought, ""Wtf am I doing"" and poured it out. "
Great letter. Can you keep us posted?

"It breaks my heart to see progressives who don't vote because the democrats aren't progressive enough. You know how you get politicians that actually support your interests? By voting consistently. Politicians follow; it's your job to lead them. You vote for the lesser of two evils, and you keep voting for them until the greater evil has literally no chance of winning. Only then does it become politically feasible for someone more progressive to enter the arena.

Vote in primaries, to tell the party what direction you want them to go, and vote in the general to give democrats the confidence to try something new. It's a slow process, but it works. If the tea party could pull it off, so can you."

"I'm sure this will get downvotes... But I think EVERY ""BI TOP ONLY"" should have to bottom at least once, so they know how anal sex works. A dick just doesn't ""slip in"" like it's a naturally lubricated vagina!!   (The same with ""TOP ONLY"" gays.). I think watching too much porn makes them think it just slips in!! 

You made the right call by ending it."
"You have no clue how important you are!!!!!!!!!

I am almost in tears from reading this and I‚Äôm not the emotional type. I came from the system and my parents adopted me when I was 8... Really long story that I won‚Äôt share here. 

But the couple that adopted me.... Are my everything remotely important to me in life and on the same level as my husband and kids (they might technically be his but they are mine too!). They passed a few years ago but just to highlight the few things they did for me: love and god did I need this, security, discipline, organization, purpose, goals, family of my own, hope, guidance, helped me learn to laugh, optimism for life, how to finally ride a bike and swim and I could go on and on and on....

You know this well, foster kids jobs is to make you question your sanity. But you hold onto the boy and never let go. Your are making a change in his life that can only be explained by another foster/adopted kid. Always know that you are single handed the closet thing on this planet to an angel. You will never get enough recognition. 

From the bottom of my soul thank you for your incredible kindness and love! "

"Don't listen to the people saying that you shouldn't cut them out because they are ""family"". A lot of people don't understand abussive parents so they say stupid things without realising it. If you have an abusive boyfriend everybody can't understand why you don't just leave. But when it is your family you should suddenly just put up with it.


This is a very brave thing you are doing. I know it isn't easy and I'm so proud of you.


I know deep down you probably want to believe that maybe this letter will change something. That maybe they'll finally realise that they are hurting you and change their ways. But this is very unlikely. There is probably nothing you can say to change their minds no matter how perfectly you shut down their arguments. 


You've given them clear boundaries. Something every person has a right to. And way more then enough time. They clearly don't want to change or care enough to. Try to stay strong. Cut them out completely and for good. Don't give them the idea or oppertunity to go back to the way things were. Because they'll may play nice for a bit, but their manipulative behavior will come out soon enough.


Goodluck to you!"
...that can't be a real term can it?

"Let's be honest, it's not like giving a blow job, it *is* giving a blow job. I don't know how her hormones may affect erections, but it'll be functionally identical to giving one to a man.

So either you're okay with that or you're not. And then either she is okay with your decision, or she's not. Not much way around it! You're not a bad person for refusing,


Unless you just need tips on how to do it or something."

"&gt;I feel extremely guilty in the sense that I am being greedy because I want everything.

This makes me sad for you.  You don't want ""everything,"" you want to be able to make an honest life and a family with someone you love.  That's a good and beautiful thing; wanting to share love with someone doesn't magically become selfish and greedy just because you're not straight. You feel guilty because you've been so deeply programmed to see yourself as inferior and undeserving of the same kind of respect and consideration that all straight people feel they have a right to.  You are not a lesser order of person than they are; your feelings, dreams, and family are not inherently less important than theirs. You are absolutely allowed to be bi or gay and have respect for yourself and your feelings, and it's actually harmful and delusional to think otherwise.

Marrying a woman because you want to keep social advantages and maintain a certain image of yourself would be selfish, however, and you don't have any right to use a woman that way.  Your social circle is encouraging you to be self-hating and hurtful to others; you simply must say no to that pressure.  I know it's hard and it's unfair, but it's the only moral thing to do.


&gt;I know that if they really love me, they will accept it but not everyone is ok with everything and I completely understand and know that they would not be able to live with it, even tho they love me very much.

I know how much you want to believe that they love you.  It's extremely painful and scary to confront the fact that your friends and family only love a false image of you.  But if they can't accept you as you are, and they can't be concerned about your *actual* happiness and well-being (as opposed to wanting things for you that would make a fictional, straight version of you healthy and happy), then they really don't love *you.* It's hard to accept how alone that leaves you in the world - how alone you've *always* been, really - but the good news is that that can change.  There are a lot of people out there who can love and appreciate you for who you are, who will support you and be happy for you, and that's infinitely more life-giving than having people in your life who can only love the person they wish you were.  Once you find them and experience that genuine love and support, you'll realize that ""losing"" the people who couldn't accept you wasn't a loss at all.

You can have health, happiness, and professional success with an honest life. But you'll never be happy or healthy with a dishonest life, I promise you, and it will be a loss for the whole world if you hide yourself and your love behind a mask forever. You're worth standing up for, and you deserve to be seen and heard and to take your space in the world. Believe it.

"Of course.

Sometimes I‚Äôll think about hooking up with a random stranger and doing all sorts of things. Breed my hole. Smack me. Choke me. Cum on my face. Three cocks in my mouth. Have sex with that 65 y/o.

That is probably definitely code. His 'ink tank' is empty and he wants you to 'fill it'. He is 'the printer' - i.e. the thing that 'reproduces' - i.e. the straight guy. 'The printer' wants you to 'fill his tank' with your 'ink'. In other words he wants you to fuck him bareback.

"I wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge the gayness and just make it about him being too young to send and receive x rated pics. 

Gliding over the fact that it‚Äôs with another male makes it less of a big deal because it shouldn‚Äôt a big deal. He‚Äôs gay or bi, It‚Äôs 2018 - He‚Äôs a normal part of society. 

I was thrusted out of the closet by my dad when I was 21. I was having a horrible fight with my bf at the time and my dad came to my house and I didn‚Äôt notice him because we were arguing so heavily. My ex bf was screaming horrible things at me. As I walked out and saw my dad and my stomach dropped. I knew he knew. This was clearly a couple arguing, not two friends.  

He sat us both down and I could tell he was FUMING. I just broke down and said, ‚ÄúDad, I guess you know I‚Äôm gay and this is my boyfriend and you‚Äôre probably not going to talk to me anymore.‚Äù

He looked at me and almost started crying as he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre gay. I‚Äôm so upset because my son is letting someone talk to him like that ‚Äú 

Honestly I‚Äôve never been more proud of my dad. I really thought he was going to disown me. The fact that he didn‚Äôt make a big deal about me being gay made me feel so good. I hid that secret for so long and it was such a relief to finally let people know. Sorry for the long rant - just wanted to share my opinion because I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs tough situation. "
That was... unexpected
"I didn't really have a relationship with my mom after I came out. Months would go by without us speaking. My dad was pretty cool about it, actually. Six years of minimal contact later I was in my garden one day and received a phone call from her. She was on the side of the interstate sobbing. After a weekend with her sisters and them asking why I was never around she came to the realization she was wrong. She apologized for being a bad mother (her words) and said she'd had an epiphany that God doesn't make mistakes and her son was not a mistake.  We're still not 100% where we were and I don't think I'll ever be a ""momma's boy"" again, but she makes a genuine effort now. Two days ago she posted a picture on FB to the effect of: ""Real Christians accept and love everyone, even homosexuals."" I about fell out of my chair. I sincerely hope you receive a similar phone call one day. There is always hope. "
"It's okay to not like things, just don't be a dick about the things you don't like.

What annoys me are the curious or closeted guys who won't shit or get off the pot. It's fine to be curious. It's fine to be closeted. But make sure you know whether or not you want to act on it before you send bizarro mixed signals to some gay dude who probably has enough B.S. to deal with. 
"I'm glad to hear.

I promise i didn't make this thread to make it an echochamber to bash this guy, its just that for real, this is the first time ive literally just put my foot down and walk out on someone during a hookup, so I felt like getting some opinion did i overreact (as he claimed)."
"First off, props to you for being a seemingly kick ass person. Secondly, props to her for being honest and open about her needs. Thirdly, I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to tell you. The only way I could begin to imagine what that would be like for you is to imagine if I dated a FTM who still had a vagina. Would I eat it out? Most likely. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve ever thought about doing, but it doesn‚Äôt gross me out. If I had feelings for someone, I‚Äôd definitely give it the ol college try. If it wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd want to do again, I‚Äôd be completely honest (hopefully) and let him know. "
"I dated this one guy whose family owned an adult theatre, one of the items sold often was ‚Äúpoppers‚Äù or as others have said, alkyl and amryl Nitrate. Also called video head cleaner, for VCR machines. It had a chemical smell, was a liquid that off gassed vapors, which were inhaled. They made you lightheaded like when painting strong smelling paint. Sometimes would give you a headache after use. The ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù was a temporary effect, much like the duration of helium‚Äôs effect on the voice. The reason it became customary for bottoms to inhale was that the use of the chemical relaxed the smooth muscle system, the involuntary sphincter system. "

"You're not fed up yet because you haven't tasted the other side yet.  One day, you're going to fall in love and hate all the time you wasted in your youth not growing together with someone else and taking cute couples photos and doing stupid but fun things that you now know not to do and having platonic dates with other gay couples and having someone to tell your innermost thoughts and someone to be there in your hour of need.  You only get one shot at life, then it's over."
Thank you for your story. We need more documentation of people's story's of this period. 
I say it jokingly with friends. It would throw me off if a guy said that during sex.
"The funny thing was he was insistent on wanting to bottom before I arrived but after he sees me he changes his mind (luckily I had still douched, sadly, *for* a complete douchebag)"
Now this is the tea.
"I got this one! My current boyfriend of 2 years, the very first time we slept together we were both VERY drunk. Like, Schwasted beyond belief. When he climbed on top of me in bed, out nowhere he went from looking intently at my eyes...to spitting on my face. 

I would have NEVER guessed it be something I want, but holy shit in the moment it was sexy as hell. 

Also, we were both drunk the first time to ease the tension. It was his first time being with a guy, and I was maybe 3 weeks into my whore phase of accepting my sexuality &amp; slutting it up. 

I had always thought he was cute and happily ended my whore phase for the sweetest, sexiest man in the universe. "

"Umm, that's how pornos start.

You're missing out!"
"My first point to ponder is your location. If you are in the United States, regardless of how these images came to exist on your device, you are in possession of child pornography. So that alone is a serious enough issue to set clear boundaries for how your brother uses your devices. Even if it were his personal device, it would constitute possession of child pornography. Imagine if the other child‚Äôs parents found out and pressed charges; you could be putting your ability to be a supportive caregiver to your brother in jeopardy due to what seems like youthful innocence.

That aside, if he is sexting it is time for him to understand the dangers of communicating this way over the internet; especially as a minor. If the person on the other end is truly a peer of your brother, curiosity is natural, but it needs guidance in this digital age. If, however the person on the other end is a child predator impersonating a young person just to get sexual images, there‚Äôs no telling what kind of pressure a predator could put on your brother to meet up somewhere,  which would put him in serious danger.

As for outing him, you don‚Äôt necessarily have to go that route just yet. Convey your concern about his inappropriate behavior in the context of sharing sexual images. Who cares if it‚Äôs with someone of the same sex or not, the act itself is the issue. If you don‚Äôt make an issue on the grounds of sexuality, you can leave it up to him to decide if he is gay, bi, queer, etc... let home come into his identity on his own. By not making it an issue I‚Äôd hope he‚Äôd feel comfortable coming to you later when he is ready to identify."

"As a bi guy, I hate it. If I want to go get some pussy, I‚Äôll go get some pussy. If I‚Äôm with a guy, I don‚Äôt need to pretend I‚Äôm with a girl."
"Not odd at all. Very common to not know how to tell people this kind of news, not wanting to because then it‚Äôs real, not knowing a good time, feeling insecure, etc etc. A lot of emotions come from a diagnosis like this that puts you in a completely different mental state. All that, and everyone deals with these things differently."
The real question is did he still pay you?
"Not an in bed thing but the first time my husband, then boyfriend, crawled into my arms on the couch. He didn‚Äôt strike me as the cuddle/snuggle type... He is also 6‚Äô6 üòÇ

But he crawled right into me to watch a movie, put his arm around my neck and laid his head on my chest... We were not on the couch long. 

Lots of people are saying arm pits... I just say the over all smell of a man! Arms, chest, legs ... Not feet though... lol"
"This thoughtline is also pervasive in the gay community.

Some jackass tried to shame me for wearing my pair of shorts, like the only way to be a *true gay* is to wear a pastel pair of shorts with a 5"" inseam.  Fuck him and his ilk.

Edit:  My shorts were too long and not colorful enough, for the record.  You boys with your 1"" inseams are gay, but need Jesus.  "
"The term ""daddy"" bothers me more than boy pussy. It just reminds me of my dad, which is a turn off. I can tolerate feminization more than incestual hinting. "
Had a similar experience where a police officer told me that it was okay to be gay at a time when I really needed to hear it. He told me about his friend that came out and that he still loved him all the same. I‚Äôll always be grateful to him for that.

When I saw that thread on ""Straight guys, what's the most intimate moment you've had with another man"" on ask reddit a week or so ago, it broke my heart, because they're all so afraid of being vulnerable. They're afraid of being policed by other men for expressing that vulnerability. It's fucking tragic. We do the same thing.

We should allow each other the space to be vulnerable, give each other support to do so, that's far stronger than carrying the burden yourself.

One of the hardest things we can possibly do is ask for help."
Oh it is 
I tend to avoid sleeping totally naked because I sweat a lot and it requires I change my bed more often. I usually keep some underwear and a top on.
"Used to have an apartment where our kitchen window faced another building. One of the windows directly across and slightly below us looked onto a guy's couch in his living room. Maybe late 30s, kinda chubby, hung. Every single morning at exactly 6:30am he would sit on the couch naked and jack off before going about his morning. He definitely didn't mind being able to be seen, at least one time he caught me looking and actually turned to face the window while he came. It was a great motivator to get up on time lol the guy was like clockwork. "
Undoubtedly.  But LAPD had a pretty bad rep at that time.  Even West Hollywood's Sheriff's Department had a lousy reputation at that time.

"I'm the same way. But one thing i've learned over the years is that I need to accept that fact that even though I don't find myself attractive, there are other people who do.  I don't have to understand it, I just have to accept it.  And my life is much better for it.

A while back I was talking to this guy on Grindr who was WAAAAAAAAAY out of my league.  But it never hurts to try, I figure. But this guy was actually interested.  And he told me to come over. It completely blew my mind.  I was 97% convinced that this guy either wasn't who he said he was at all, or he'd given me a fake address and he was just laughing at me for showing up, or he was lying in wait with some friends to beat me up and rob me.  Because the other possibility--that some craaazy hot dude was actually into me--was as likely as winning the lottery in my mind.  I told 2 different friends where i was going, sent them screenshots of the guy's face and info and address in case he killed me or something, because that seemed more likely.  But when I got to his house, the dude was REAL!  And he was fucking AMAZING.  And he was into ME!  And we had some of the hottest sex of my life!  This event (and another one like it that happened 2 months later) genuinely shook my understanding of reality. 

You have some serious confidence and self-esteem issues.  You need to fight those urges that tell you you're not worth it or that other people won't find you attractive.  Learn to take ""Yes"" for an answer when someone wants to hook up with you.  Don't ignore hot guys when they contact you.  Sure, some will be catfish, i've had that happen to me too, but some will be real.  What do you have to lose??  "

Anyway this guy comes up and asks what I was talking about, and I told him it's a standard sausage casserole. He looks me up and down and asks if he could use a different kind of sausage.

I shit you not, the next words out of my mouth were ""well you could probably use chorizo""

Literally seconds later though I realised what he said and flirted back. We ended up in bed together anyway - and his sausage wasn't half bad..."
"I wish my husband uses Reddit because his opinion here would be good. So I will try and tell it from a spouses point of view. 

My husband is a firefighter. One of the most alpha male careers I have encountered. But it is also a generational field of work, combined with pride, tradition and the over all need to be ‚Äúmanly‚Äù because that‚Äôs all these guys do is prove there manliness day in and day out.  

Unfortunately a societies stereotype is far from reality here. That stereotype is weak, small, helpless and useless. 

This is where the stereotype and alpha male careers collide. A gay man working in these blue collar fields are not going to be labeled as gay because of the association, in fact they will go to great lengths to avoid the association. They know exactly what is said and what people think of gay men. 

And the typical non-blue collar workers advise of going to ownership/management/superior is flat out not going to work. Why? Because all that sensitivity and diversity training they will get is because the gay guy got his feeling hurt... But at least they are blackballed now...

My husband tried desperately to not be outed at work. But firehouse crews are ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù and because these guys spend so much time together it finally came out. He was heartbroken. It was not the new and young blood guys he was worried about, it was the crusty old dinosaurs that he feared. But he kept his mouth shut and doubled down on proving that he was not an embarrassment to his crew or the department and took his new goal personal. He took his dedication and work ethic  and love of his career to a new level. Other than a random, though well intended joke, it still hurt him to the core, nothing truly bad came from it. No one ever flat out confronted him. Today he feels part of the ‚Äúguys‚Äù again and we even go to their BBQ‚Äôs as a couple, something he use to never do. He is very well respected now and admired by almost all (of course there are bigots, that‚Äôs life).  The guys he works with love him as a friend. 

He did more for the gay community and our reputation than all the diversity classes, manager sit downs and special training could do 1000 times over. Hell he has taken phone calls from other firefighters and how to come out of the closet at work and not have problems. He encouraged a massive cultural change (at his station, maybe just maybe a few stations) and never said a word. I am so proud of him and he doesn‚Äôt think anything of it, just glad he can be himself and not worry what people say when he is not there. 

That‚Äôs my advice to you. Work hard, educate through the impression you make. And I will ask you this, what is going to get more respect and awareness for the men you work with? The hard work, having a level head and work ethic you display or a talk from the job site manager and diversity training?

It sucks but you can do so much by just being an example and not a talking piece... change the views and opinions of the men you work with by being the example and showing how terribly wrong the stereotype is. "

"Met my husband in a gym. I seriously only needed a spotter at the bench. Just so happens that he is the only other guy there at the time. Nothing more happened. Over the weeks we would see each other and I was really digging his workout. So I started talking to him about his workout, then started his workout and then started planning workout times together. 

It creeped really slow from there. We started doing cardio together and then started to occasionally go out to eat dinner some times. Then he needed a hand with a project at his house. 

He knew I was gay with in the first few weeks just from gym talk. He was married, to a woman and going through one of the most  ridiculous divorces I had ever heard of. 

So about 10-11 months into us being friends, he asks to go out and grab a bite to eat. I am thinking he is going to vent more on his ex... Nope LOL. Turns out he is a major closet case, repressed all these feelings and the combination of his wonderful ex and working out with me has done a real number on him. Did I just stumble into the hottest guy I have ever seen, possibly be gay and have an interest in me???

I pump the brakes about as hard as I can and we go as slow as I can possibly go to not fuck this up. So we start by talking about his attraction to men and he has some serious issues with the stereotypes of gay men.  His ex wife, child support and lawyers are draining his bank account and he needs a place to stay and he moves in with me around month 14-15.  

No sex at this point. Like I said he had some serious identity things to work through and I was going out of my way to not fuck this up. 

We are at a year and a half at this point and I am so stupid in love with this man. I have always been so self centered and with him I didn‚Äôt give a fuck about myself, everything I did or wanted to do was to impress him, make him happy and take away his doubts and pain. Then I knew I really am in love with him and want him physically but emotionally also, I could careless about another guy and realized I cared only about him. He gets settled in after several weeks, lots of questions asked and then answered, time spent reflecting, gay porn studied, a trial run of living with a man and he is finally ready to take his first official gay step. 

I have never been happier and I can not think of a single thing he does not give me or I could ask for any more of. Still kind of fucked up with identity, but he was already a private person before and there was no reason to try and force a change there. We fight occasionally, argue every so often  and disagree a lot! But to be cheesy for a second, we are two puzzle pieces perfectly made for each other. And I have never been happier and never thought I could be this happy and I love talking about our relationship and about him. We have been married for 6 years now, have three kids (from his marriage) and still have an incredible burning passion for each other, that you would think we were 18. We are both "

"Suggestion: replace ""you guys"" with simply ""you."" It will slightly shorten and therefore increase the readability of some of your sentences. ""You"" acts as both singular and plural in our language. I know ""you guys"" is used as an idiom conversationally, but I believe shorter is almost always better in writting.

Also, here's a thought: it may be more personal and cathartic for you to write this by pen once you feel your draft is polished enough. It's a personal touch I use for special occasions.

"The govt has already said that they will follow anything the court says. The present BJP govt is a Hindu right winger, backed by RSS (hindu organisation). RSS has already said it **supports** gay rights and Muslims groups in India made some noise opposing but they didn't bother afterwards.

Other parties are on different ends of the spectrum , but no scenario exists where an anti gay coalition comes to power."

"I really believe that within the gay community (not all the time) but one of the reasons people are so afraid to tie themselves down is because they're trying to protect themselves. Its so much easier on those lonely nights to fill the time with a random body to fuck and not invest any emotion in, because if we don't invest our emotions, there's no chance of getting hurt. It's self preservation. The scary fact is that love and relationships take risk. Risking the chance of getting hurt, badly, and weighing the options and seeing if it's worth the hurt. I firmly believe it is, and those who don't may turn down a life changing opportunity."

"It's kind of odd in that her opponent seemed to generalise and belittle every time he opened his mouth but got a free pass ... probably because no-one literally believes a thing he says. 

Hillary in her manner came across as more controlled, more plausible - generally - so her 'deplorables' comment was believed.

I think tho, that HRC simply lost because of who she was. She was the establishment. She was the 'Watergate babies' Democrat par excellence, trying to seek a mandate after ***forty years*** in which the majority had seen no real wage growth, a period that coincides neatly with her allegedly 'progressive' political career.  

Rejection of her was rejection of that era.  She was and remains 'crooked Hillary' not because of any individual wrongdoing, but because she claimed or pretended to believe in better, but somehow failed to deliver.  

Her hawkishness on foreign affairs -she *was* good at delivering bombs and air strikes - will not be missed overseas. "

"I come from a deeply religious upbringing.  Move on with your life, but also know this (and not because you should hope for or wait for it, but just so you know):  


  I was raised a pastor's kid.  When I came out, my dad yelled at me in Hebrew.  We're not Jewish, just really that devout; the Bible was meant to be read in its original language, nevermind the mental contortions necessary to get there.

I'm 25 years older (not 25 years old) now.  He came around.  He couldn't reconcile what he knows of me as a person with what the church told him -- and the cognitive dissonance eventually required reckoning.  My dad still deeply believes in God, but people sometimes surprise you.

To make things even stranger, we mostly don't speak and I only found out last year that he'd left several years prior.  He left and didn't tell me.  I guess that's noble?  I'm not sure.

"It's great that you're sharing your story.  None of this should be forgotten.  It has a very significant place in our very rich, and often painful historical tapestry.  Stories like this need to be remembered right alongside those at Stonewall, in Auschwitz, and those who made great contributions in art, science and all areas of society.  

I certainly remember the era you lived through and it has affected me pretty dramatically.  Based on your story, I'm 20 years younger than you.  By the time I really realized I was gay, it would have been around 1988.  I grew up in a very religious area and I pushed myself as far into the closet as I could get because among all of the jokes, slurs, and religious propaganda, there was this one thing that was even more terrifying.  It was watching those around me react to the constant news of the AIDS epidemic.  They were happy about it.  It was a scourge from god.  They were sad that some innocent bystanders, like Ryan White, suffered because of it.  But mostly, they were just fine with thousands upon thousands of nameless, faceless people dying. I think that all contributed to the reason I didn't come out until I was in my early 30's and why I still don't like going back there to visit family despite the fact that most of them have changed for the better.  

Regardless, thanks for reminding us.  Knowing how we got here is essential to navigating problematic situations.  And since gay history is almost universally untaught in schools, it's especially easy for those who oppose us to whitewash it or completely fabricate it.  I'm so happy that kids are growing up in a vastly different world now, but it's so disheartening to hear young people with a totally fictional view of the past.  My head nearly explodes when I hear one of them talk about how the church has always loved gays.  It takes a lot of restraint to not go into a full blown rant about how the church taught me that the Nazi's were mostly homosexuals because they were the only ones devoid of moral conscience and therefore willing to commit atrocities.  Every time someone suggested that we shouldn't care if gays can get married, they would get a long dissertation about how gays are all pedophiles and any step to normalize their behavior would be encouraging the downfall of society.  

Remembering the truth is important."
"Yeah, you can't just go days refusing to talk to your boyfriend, let alone a week. Not without explanation.

"Because apparently heterosexualality is a very tenuous thing for men. Get too comfortable noticing attractive qualities about other men and you're no longer straight. Being straight is associated with the majority and privilege, so of course most men don't want to lose that identity for the complicated existence of an LGBTQIA-whatever if they can help it."

"First and foremost, Pride has its roots in protest. So there's a rebellious aspect to it, hence the spectacle and general debauchery and decadence. It's a middle finger to all of those people who would want us all dead. And make no mistake, those people still exist, they're just too cowardly to say so to our faces.

Over time, Pride has adopted a more celebratory aspect. It's not necessarily being proud that we aren't ashamed, but utilizing pride as an *antidote* to the shame that we have been conditioned to feel about ourselves by straight society. Also, it's pride about how far the queer community has come in terms of cultural recognition and our rights.

Not to mention that Pride is becoming quite the corporate event, with lots of rainbow shit to sell. That's a whole other discussion, lol."

"My first lover and I fell madly in love as soon as we joined the military, and remained totally monogamous for the next 16 years.  I look back on that stroke of supreme good fortune with wonderment.  Not only for getting to experience such a love, but due to the way it took me off the market right as the disease was spreading through our community, and before we knew it was even there.  I know I would have spread my wild oats if I had not been so very much in love.

By our mid 30s every single gay friend of our youth was dead.  We were the soul survivors of our circle.  I am a career military man who saw action on four continents.  Been shot, and chased through the woods by the bad guys, but I can honestly say I have never seen such courage as I did in our gay community dealing with the disease through the early years.  Ambulances driving away and refusing to take your friend to the hospital.  ER rooms refusing to admit them when they were in crisis.  Taking them home and packing them in ice against the temperature, because you don't know what else to do.  When you finally get them in the hospital, you and your friends have to write up a schedule of visits to take in their food, because the nurses would leave it out in the corridor.  Changing their sheets and bathing them because the nurses will leave them in their own soiled state.

I also saw the worst of humanity in our community.  HIV positive men coming home to find all their belongings strewn on the street, and the locks changed by their fearful gay roommates.   People being told they were positive who then went and deliberately infected others at the bathhouse.  Or who then preyed on the youngsters showing up, and deliberately coaxing them into unprotected sex.  Long term lovers who abandoned their partners without warning at the first sign of illness.  Cowardliness.  Theft.  Betrayal.  I got to see all this as well.

I remember the mayor of my city publicly running for office with a group of his allies, and them calling themselves, ""the straight slate"".  They went around proclaiming that the cure for AIDS was a 357 bullet.  This in the fourth largest American city of the time.  Bashers came to my house three times to threaten and bully, and you dared not call the police.

I still wake up dreaming of the hospitals, and my sick friends.  I still can't believe I survived those days.  We were all so certain we would all get it in the end.  And all but my first lover and I did get it and die.  I have never had any real sense of roots since, nor any real connection to any community, nor my nation.  I have a keen interest in life, and I adore my friends, but life is such a fragile thing.  You dare not lean on it.  Suit up and show up one day at a time.  Try to be fully present and genuine to those you encounter.  Add to the stream of life, and don't demand too much of it.  For me this is the way forward."
The real questions getting asked on /r/askgaybros
He wants to meet by the printer. Drop the ink when he walks by üòè
"Haha my boyfriend and I talked about this once. He places his up and I place mine down. It's just more comfortable for us to do what we prefer. Neither is odd. What makes you comfy is up to you. 

We've both tried doing the opposite of what we prefer. We couldn't stand it for long haha. "
Real men do whatever they want
"Damn, you're right. "
I think you should talk to him. It‚Äôs better to have the conversation than sneak around. 
"Nit picking about their body (ie a bit of a belly, not enough muscle, etc). One of the first guys I hooked up with wouldn't take his shirt off until he turned off the lights. He was a little heavy, but he could pull it off and it wasn't like I didn't realize it with his shirt on. "
Internalized homophobia 
A guy I'm seeing always likes to smack me around (already something I didn't expect to like) but what I really didn't expect was this aggressive dom to ask me to hit him back. That's 100% not me- I'm a huge softie. But he finally talked me into it and the way his face lit up after I slapped him for the first time made me finally get it 
"Yes, they are drugs originally used as heart medicine.  They are generally safe, but they cause your blood pressure to temporarily drop.  If you are already on a blood pressure medicine, it can reduce your pressure to dangerously low levels.

They create a short time high than many guys think enhance their orgasm and make you looser for sexual experiences."
"When after something they ""realign"" the package or the boxers."
