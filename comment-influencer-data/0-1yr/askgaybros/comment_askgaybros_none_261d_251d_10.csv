"**BITCH** better have my *update*

Edit: Holy shit my first gold and silver,  thanks !

I‚Äôm glad OP is keepin us posted! 

Wedding bells, anyone ?
Jk!"
"~~I am~~ We are all living vicariously through you right now.

"Shame on you for ruining his serial killer evening. Now who is he going to murder and eat?

Never did think about others though do you?"
"OMG I need to now everything about this relationship. 

It feels like an episode of a TV series and I cannot wait to see the next one! üòÇüòç"
Doesn‚Äôt happen to me; people just assume I like guys. 
"It‚Äôs always healthy to explore your sexuality. A lot of times people don‚Äôt realize they have some sort of homosexual attraction until they meet the right guy. I‚Äôd say maybe explain to him the situation if you feel confident enough, that you‚Äôre straight but have some sort of feeling for him. Maybe go on a couple dates if he‚Äôs okay with your situation. Just see how it goes. A lot of homosexual attraction isn‚Äôt just sex, it‚Äôs also the romantic attraction behind it. "
omg plz update update update
"I had a customer tell me that the local Mom‚Äôs Facebook page was a great place to find single women.  I polite said that I wasn‚Äôt interested.  He asked why not?  And continued promoting the virtues of single mothers looking for a man.  When he finally paused, I told him that the Dad‚Äôs page is more to my liking.  He was very confused until the woman behind him piped up, saying ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs saying that he is gay.‚Äù"
"Eventually my good friend, you'll be scrolling through it on here! "
You had me on edge the whole time thinking this wasn‚Äôt going to have a good ending but goodness thank you it did. 
What kind of people do you expect at 4AM?
Believed I was straight while masterbating exclusively to guys
What sort of verse voodoo is this
"Hate to make this comment but, username check out. 

"
Sorry to say this but I think it's more than harmless fun...
"Actually, porn sites very often offer gay only ads, but if you're using Private/Incognito mode, it'll take few openings of different gay videos for the cookies to give you gay only advertisments."
"You gave him a prostate orgasm and his is very sensitive. Read up online where it‚Äôs located (simplest way to explain is put your index finger in his ass and give a ‚Äúcome hither motion‚Äù and you should feel it about the size of a walnut.) Some guys experience pain when it‚Äôs stimulated,  ur obviously he does not. You either hit it with your dick during sex or all the movement when you were fucking him stimulated him enough to orgasm. Now the fun part is you just get to keep having sex in various positions/ways until you make it happen again and can repeat it over and over. :-)"
Where are you in Texas. My friend works for an LGBT shelter in Dallas. I can ask her to help find you some housing 
Exactly! no more thinking with my dick
"He sounds gay and closeted. But even more importantly he sounds dishonest and inconsiderate of your feelings.

I think you need to get out of this relationship..."
"1. Start saving every penny you can. Clip coupons even. If eating out, stick to the dollar menu.

2. Pick up extra hours at work or grab a part-time job.

3. Skip the apartment for now and look for a room to rent. Go to a supermarket around you and check the message boards by the entrance/exit. You can usually find a good price for a room here.

4. If you are staying with a friend, do not wear out your welcome. It shouldn't take you longer than a week to find a room for rent somewhere near by.

5. Keep your head up. This is just one of many challenges you have faced.
"
I mean unless he was playing a really long joke it could be that he was just as shy and in a similar position as yourself. 
"Some people just have incompatible personalities. As long as you don't think you're better than them, I wouldn't worry. "
"&gt;state of confusion

Not so much. You don't sound confused at all to me. You like being with him, you like how sex is with him, you just aren't sure what it says about your identity. 

&gt;obviously I'm gay apparently - BUT he's the only man I find attractive

I would call you bisexual, but it isn't really up to me. Labels are used by people to describe their sexuality, and communicate their feelings about their sexuality. You get to say what you are comfortable with. You get to use it as a tool to decide how to explain your feelings and desire to other people.   

YOU have to seek approval from WITHIN. You know it's ok to be sexual with him, your body loves it, he obviously has some skills, and you enjoy how you feel with you are with him. --So be careful about how you feel when you are not with him. Be careful not to shame yourself because he is a man. Be careful with what value judgments you allow to be placed on yourself because you are having sex with another dude. 

Many of us who identify gay or bi starting in our first same sex experience, often have conflicting feelings. We enjoy it while it is going on, then after it is over or after discussion we may feel shame. Do not allow these feelings to be accepted in the quiet places of your mind. Challenge them by remembering that bi and str8 and gay men are all normal, acceptable, and good. 

If you and him are both enjoying it, then don't let what other people think influence your time with him. Let it go where it goes. Good Luck my dude. Merry Xmas!"
"Promises a tip for almost painless bottoming.

Proceeds to say the following:

&gt;this is gonna hurt like a mf

:)"
Good story and way to show him and yourself respect due to his being drunk.  
Good for you! If he never calls remember this exhilarating feeling that you‚Äôll get next time you ‚Äúput yourself out there‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt always workout for many reasons. The times they do call are even better.

"I guess, but it‚Äôs a huge loss to those of us who have all day to waste scrolling through porn.  Tumblr‚Äôs was insanely hot and endless.  Miss it a lot.  "
"Johnny.
He had golden blonde hair and he was a wrestler. We all went over to his house and played truth or dare a few times, I was obsessed with his cheerfulness... Every girl he dated I envied and I tried so hard to ignore how I felt but he lived in my neighborhood and I had to ride the bus home with him every day.
One day he stole my house keys and kept hiding them from me. Putting them behind his back and when I'd go for them he'd raise his arms up and keep them from me.
Finally after a minute of this he dropped my keys down his pants and told me to get them.
I will always regret not going for it.
Johnny Flagg I'll always remember you."
You seem to have me confused with someone else. Sorry.
"One of my straight guy friends seemed *really* interested and would often ask questions when we were alone.

Turned out he wasn‚Äôt so straight after all..."
"I had a guy try and get me to fuck him on the front porch of his house, facing a very busy street in Indianapolis because his grandmother was inside. We ended up just driving back to my place that was about 45 minutes away but damn, you really gonna take my dick on your grandmama‚Äôs porch. Ha! Dudes are funny. "
Cut all communications with your parents until you've reestablished yourself. You need to be on firm footing before dealing with that bullshit again. 
"I WISH I COULD GIVE U REDDIT GOLD, DAM

Edit; OMG my first silver too thanks fam"
"A nice thought, but you can't really say ""All of us are bisexual"", especially when you say you're gay a couple sentences later. Truth is that a lot more people are bisexual than admit to it, but you can't just throw in your life experience and expect it to stick for every one"
You captured so beautifully the exquisite torture. Ugh. I've yet to experience my first kiss.
I am in Dallas
"Could be bi. Could be gay and into effeminate men. Either way, sounds hot. You should just go with what feels good and put a label on it later. "
"I‚Äôve learned from experience that the initial penetration hurts, but I usually have to take the dick out for a few seconds and reinsert it. Doesn‚Äôt hurt at all after that "
"lmao

Now they'll think you're a slut"
"Only monolingual people will mock someone with an accent. They have no idea how hard conversing and working in a 2nd language can be.  


I wouldn't move on beyond this.  This is hurtful to you and therefore abusive.  You are trying to fit into his culture and he is belittling you for it.  You need to confront him and tell him how this makes you feel.

If he continues to belittle you, well, then you know what kind of person he is."
"15 minutes to look for a condom??? Trying to bait you into raw sex, pitch black and dark? trying to disguise he don't look like his pictures. You dodge a STD bullet by bailing"
Omg! I don't wanna even thing about it lol
"wait how did you pass a hand written note through grindr?

Oh wow my first reddit silver!  Thanks kind strange!"
I‚Äôve never seen straight porn on my gay porn. It‚Äôs all male. Lol.
"Me at 12:

""Maybe if I masturbate to straight porn every other day I'll actually be bi and I can hide my sexuality forever.""

""OK that didn't go as planned, how about every three days?""

""... Once a week?""

""Fuck."""
"lmao

*looks at my own username*

oh"
I feel attacked 
"Thanks for sharing. Sound like you have come a long way. Remember, it‚Äôs about progress, not perfection. Best of luck to you in 2019. "
"I would go for it and text him. It sounds like a new, exciting, and more importantly, promising endeavour. 

It‚Äôs tough to tell him ‚Äúkeep it private‚Äù because you don‚Äôt want to alienate him, but that‚Äôs a risk you‚Äôll have to take if you don‚Äôt want your mutual friends to know.

Alternatively, you could keep it casual in the way you approach him. Don‚Äôt talk about feelings but keep it platonic when you text him. Then when you finally meet, explain yourself to him. Some gays don‚Äôt like dealing with guys who are questioning, but if he knows you‚Äôre straight that‚Äôs not a problem.

Also, don‚Äôt feel the need to rush and label yourself right away. But don‚Äôt pass up on a great opportunity out of fear of labels."
Idk I really miss the amateur stuff lol
"Aw, this is a nice story. It‚Äôs always great to hear guys looking out for each other‚Äôs best interests when intoxicated, despite the mutual attraction.

P.S.: Aaron was not a key character. :P"
"Tease with the tip to relax the hole, then go balls deep.


As an old (31 yo) gay, I'm sorry for not sharing this before. I honestly thought it was gay instinct."
Took me too long to work out why you don't like smiling women. 
"I just have to use my imagination more.
So far it sucks. "
"‚ÄúOh!  That‚Äôs cool.  I but there‚Äôs some hot single Dad‚Äôs in there, too!‚Äù"
"Had a similar experience on tuesday. I was on my way home from a house party and a bit tipsy at 1AM. Hot guy wanted to meet up. I told him that i had no condom, he said that he had. 

I get there, apartment in pitch black. He had like a bedside lamp on, that‚Äôs it. We do some foreplay and then he starts looking for the condom, for like 15min, which he didn‚Äôt find. I told him, it‚Äôs okay i‚Äôll get one and come back in like an hour. I‚Äôm pretty sure that i got catfished, he looked significantly less attractive in real life. Jumped on the bus and blocked him. 
"
"Heh, I just got back from doing some last-minute Christmas shopping. I was in a checkout line with a female cashier, who happened to let out a slight yawn as she began serving an older guy in front of me. The old guy goes ""See, that's what happens when you're out chasing boys. You get too tired for work the next day!"" The woman, unphased, says cheerfully ""I don't think my girlfriend would appreciate if I spent any time at all chasing boys"". The look on the guy's face was priceless, but he cracked a smile and says ""Chasing girls is okay too""."
Best bottoming I had where I literally didn‚Äôt feel a thing was when the guy pulled out his massage table and gave me a full body massage sans dick for about an hour to let me body relax (I have a bit of trauma so relaxing sexually is difficult for me). Literally didn‚Äôt feel him go in I was so relaxed and by no means an experienced bottom. The actual sex I obviously felt but that initial penetration? N o t h i n g. It was bonkers for someone who routinely is in pain from toys.
Thank you bro. You hit it right on the head with the whole quiet places of my mind. I'm accepting of it and I acknowledge that I love it but I have a little voice in the back of my mind telling me not to do it. Thank you for talking the time out and saying that. It means alot. I think I'm worrying about the whole identity thing too much. I should just go with the flow. You guys are so kind in this subreddit
"Do you remember the position you were in when you gave it to him? You should try this (and various positions similar to it) because your dick was clearly in the right spot, based on its shape and his ass.

Another fun thing to do: finger him until you find his prostate. You can then literally just press it with your finger and it‚Äôll make him go crazy."

There are going to be a number of LGBT focused organizations that can help you find a place. They are sadly very experienced in dealing with this situation and can provide a lot of guidance. 
There‚Äôs a sell going on over at r/pitchforkemporium if OP doesn‚Äôt give us that update.
Stay closeted out of fear of what the reactions of those around me would be. 
"I think it's really good for homophobic people to meet and interact with real life gay people. As you see, they tend to change their tune when confronted with reality."
"Tumblr helped me accept myself and find a few communities that helped me grow as a person. It wasn‚Äôt **just** porn, it was also finding that there‚Äôs other guys like me, and other people from my religion who are gay and left it. So it‚Äôs kinda heartbreaking. As far as the porn goes...I mean...there‚Äôs other sites?"
Get off your dad‚Äôs computer
You already know what to do: see Sam again without labeling it and giving a fuck what others think. It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôll see him again and it‚Äôll become clear you just want to be friends. Or you‚Äôll end up doing something naughty together. Or you won‚Äôt like him at all. But the only way to be sure is not to be a fucking pussy. Text him. And take that sweater to the cleaners before you give it back.
Let‚Äôs all post pics of ourselves in undies. 
"I have a good friend on this sub who I hope reads this. 

Merry Christmas, OP!"
You better be quick cuz Sam waits for no one.
"There are better and worse ways to express that sentiment. 

Something like ‚Äúno fags, if I liked femininity I would date a woman‚Äù is bad. 

Saying ‚ÄúI tend to go for butch, dominant men‚Äù gets your point across without putting anyone else down. "
Same was waiting for a rape accusation or a lap full of puke. Suspense is a key element to a good story I guess but jeez I need to sit down now. 
"Yes, keep looking and hopefully one day you‚Äôll find your man.   I did!  "
Thank god someone said it. 
Boys ... this is how it's done. 
"Did you do anything to prepare?  If someone is not used to bottoming and wanted to try it, what do you recommend?  What tips did you read that really helped?   "
Yeah that is what I was thinking because I am enjoying it so much right now. The thought of fucking him turns me on. It's just so crazy. I'm 29 and never had any sexual thoughts about men until I met him
Even Jesus got nailed by those Roman soldiers.
"I thought this server was hitting on me, and when iy was time to leave, my buddy stuck around to try and get a number. But found out they were actually interested in me instead. Buddy didn't bother to either give my number out or get theirs. What a guy."

"It does, dude, it does.  You can‚Äôt see it from there - we all get that.  But there are literally millions of us out here who have been where you are or some form of it and our lives are immeasurably better now.

We‚Äôre here for you.  We love you just the way you are.  Proud of you for being brave enough to put yourself out there and admit it‚Äôs tough.  Hang on - a better life is coming.

My straight friends spend more time thinking about who's a bottom than I or other gays I know do. Straight guys are weird ü§∑.
hope you answered allll his questions !
"Fell in love with me straight bestfriend, got super close to where it felt like dating. Then got jealous when he actually dated someone. Man I was so dumb. "
he's a dick and you should find someone who is better behaved. someone who wants to play games with someone they're on a date with isn't serious enough to warrant spending more time. 
This has impacted the LGBT community far more than str8. 
"Sometimes I feel like the biggest hoe since I never have problems inserting anything reasonably sized into my butt.

When God divided butthole magic, I must have been very pushy... "
Funny part is... I'm 100% sure she'll be talking about you behind your back now.
Big hug to you. One day the time will be right. 
"What do you call the feel that mixed of happiness, excitement and jealousy? Because that‚Äôs how I feel reading this.
Fuck you OP for making me so damn jealous."
"Oh honey he's crazy.
Normal people don't wring you through an emotional roller coaster to ""see how you would react"". 
That's what crazy people do.
He was trying to manipulate you with different types of attention to see how quickly you'd modify your behavior to suit his. That's what we do when we train dogs.
You're better and worth more than that. 
Run. Don't walk. "
"Having a close gay family member doesnt mean you'll accept them. A lot of anti-gay people feel that way due to ideology, opinion or ignorance"
Maybe you‚Äôd be more comfortable during sex if you got the know the guy more first? 
"Glad you mentioned anatomy. Dick size and shape and the size and shape of his rectum are both super important factors. Having sort of ‚Äúmatching parts‚Äù I‚Äôm sure helps achieve the no-hands orgasm. That kind of chemistry you can‚Äôt create, it‚Äôs innate."
"i mean i can send the  number, maybe you and him can roll through the glass and dirt"
"I had a similar experience with a waiter last year. I'm from a small town where everyone knows everyone or at least knows someone you know. While we didn't actually know each other, we had one mutual connection. I took a chance, got his number from the mutual and texted him that I thought he was cute and polite (Yes, I was getting vibes the whole time and I made it clear to the mutual I was interested in him) He seemed to respond well, but slightly guarded. I'm a hairdresser and he even made the comment that he'd come to me for his next haircut. Well, he never did and the last time I had texted him, he didn't respond. I deleted his number and never heard or saw him again. Instead of thinking what if's and why's, I'm just glad I tried. Good luck!"
"&gt;But even more importantly he sounds dishonest and inconsiderate of your feelings.

If the problem was just that he was gay, then she could at least trust him enough to agree to stay married until they can get their finances in order so that when they divorce, neither of them will be screwed over financially.

But he's actively looking to deceive her, which means that she needs to protect herself, and her finances, from him"
"This made me LOL. 

Edit: your comment, not my comment at all. "
"To go through your stuff:

1. The person freaking out is a moron. Acting like an entitled kid and getting angry with someone who‚Äôs just working a shitty job. Anyone who‚Äôs worked a retail/service job will tell you this is shitty. We just wanna do our job, go home and cry in minimum wage. I don‚Äôt need some cunt yelling at me as well.
2. Breaking up with someone who happens to be trans doesn‚Äôt make you transphobic. People have preferences, shocking.
3. The reason the lady got upvoted was because the gay guy was fucking horrible to her. Most people who realize they‚Äôre gay while in a straight marriage will try to end it soon. He kept it going after realizing it, cheated on her, and gave her an STD. Fuck him

"I had a similarly weird experience this year: Mad hot dude messages me. I look around the apps a bit and discover that he's also escorting. Thinking back and forth about meeting him, until I decide to just give it a try (I live in a very safe country and left most of the cash and cards at home). When I arrive, he isn't talking much, but he's even hotter than his pictures and we get right down to it. Nice foreplay, some kissing, he even rims me a bit and asks me if I want to use a condom (I do) before he puts his dick in my ass. I like missonary, because I can see the other guys face. He turns me around right quick though. Whatever, this is an amazing fuck...until I notice that he is filming with his phone. I tell him to stop it and delete the video he just took. He obliges, I bail out of there. 

He messaged me a bit later, complaining that his room smells of poppers - that gave me quite a bit of schadenfreude :)"
Nah but you do you
Dude you sound like you have a BIG problem. Life must be so HARD for you. I hope you find peace and happiness. 
"Either punch him in the face, one-upping the slap, or gasp, look surprised, and walk back slowly clutching my face where he struck me:

""You've hurt me; you're not the man I fell in love with. I'm leaving you Stefano, I'm taking the kids!""

""The hell you are Giuseppina, were are you gonna go? Who's gonna take a poor bitch like you off the street?""

""I'm going to Sardinia, with my sister; don't follow us, I never want the kids to see their bastard father again!""

""You're not taking my kids, Marco and Laura are staying in Rome with me!""

""Goodbye, Stefano, I hope you get what you deserve.""

I slam the door and get the kids, get them to car when Stefano walks out, blind with rage, a leather belt in his hands, and he----

What was the question? Oh, yeah, I'd probably hit him back."
"The straight dating scene is the same. Looks get you in the door, but personality is what settles you in for a LTR."

I have experienced this with my boyfriend a couple of times. One was with a missionary position and the other was me on top of him and I was in total control. Maybe it‚Äôs got something to do with the right placement of his dick inside my ass that got my prostate stimulated. I‚Äôd say the biggest factor was I was really at the height of being horny. I didn‚Äôt cum for three straight weeks which added up to cumming hands-free.

"I don't feel uncomfortable around guys like that, I just find it irritating and grating. I feel the same way around women who act that way as well, or those ditsy / valley girl types. 


If you're uncomfortable, I'd assess why. If you find it annoying, well you're not going to like every personality type you come across. That's just reality. 


I'm sure lots of people don't like me because I'm blunt, straight forward, overly analytical, hate small talk, and mostly enjoy discussing ""deep"" things that are exhausting for a lot of people (which can also come off as pretentious and/or condesceding).


I'm not over here telling people they need to embrace my personality because if they don't they have some kind of internalized phobia. "
"No but I always think ""Why did he swipe right on me?"""
I‚Äôve never experienced pain during insertion. More like if the guy is too big it feels like he‚Äôs hitting my kidneys and lungs when he‚Äôs all the way in.

I feel like calling a guy bro while your dick is in his ass is getting into some kinky territory.
"When I was your age (back before the great flood) they were still taking us gays off to jail in America.  I was a young man in the military.  My parents, upon learning that I was gay, sent my commander a letter telling him I was an ""abomination"".  At that moment, when my whole life hung in the balance, I had the greatest stroke of good luck.

My commander's brother had been gay, and had been driven by his parents and society to suicide.  He called me in, showed me the letter, and then burned it in front of me.  He told me that he would be my father if I needed an older person's help.  Later I learned he sent my parents a letter informing them that bringing accusations against an intelligence officer of the federal government was a felony offense, and he would remand them for charges if he heard anything more out of them.  I don't even think that is true, but it sure made my parents back off.

The crazy thing in my regards was that I let my parents lure me back again and again after this point.  They would hint at reconciliation, and I would come running, and then they would pull the rug out from under me again.  I wish I could have those lost years back.  All the energy and attention and worry spent on people trying to send me to prison could have been spent on making friends with people who actually loved me.

It is important to take it seriously when people turn you over to police, and try to kill you, and try to destroy your life.  Don't let them off the hook later.  Get free of such people, and don't spend another second of your time on their malice and lust for control.

I am so glad you escaped.  I am wishing this will be your happiest Christmas season ever!"

"Some guys do like to play around on the internet, dabbling in forbidden fantasies, but would never actually cheat. They just like the sexually charged back-and-forth, but are too turned off by the whole thing in real life - sexually transmitted diseases, the particulars of anal sex, etc. They remain committed but are obviously 'bisexual'. 

But what you should be asking yourself is if you want to be married to what might be a closeted homosexual man. Normal straight guys don't 'mess around' with other men. They do that with women."

Labels sometimes are worse than useless.   You are having a fling with a guy who has some feminine traits.  You are loving it.  It appears he is too.   Don't worry about labels.  Be happy you have something going on that makes you happy.
"My suggestions are

* make fapping, watching porn more rare
* don't follow a script
* take your time and stay mentally into the moment, the sex, and the guy
* let him work the condom onto you if working it breaks you out of your mental zone
* back up a few steps if you start to get soft, take some time, and get hard again

Some of our expectations are set by porn and they're not right. Keep in mind, porn doesn't show us the outtakes! 

We're not making a baby here, we're just two guys having fun and getting off together.  The condom keeps us safer and we can work it and keep the focus on having fun together.

"I think smell is often underrated when it comes to sexual contact.  The smell, sweat, saliva, etc of a partner is very erotic.  I love going about my day with the taste of them in my mouth and the scent of them on my skin.  I am often hesitant to shower because I want it to last longer.  "

"That‚Äôs not really what micro aggressions are.  Micro aggressions are things that people say or do to a member of a minority group that are not intended to be hurtful, but reflect a subconscious bias the person didn‚Äôt know they had.

A great example of this is when a white person asks an Asian person where they are from, and when the Asian person says, ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm from California‚Äù, the response is something like ‚Äúright, but where are you FROM?‚Äù  It‚Äôs a micro aggression because it implies that at least on a subconscious level the person asking doesn‚Äôt think the other person is really American because they are Asian.

FYI, didn‚Äôt try to make this about race or anything, but it‚Äôs the first example that came to mind because I‚Äôm familiar with it.

People who are fake to your face and talk shit behind your back are just crap people. :)"

"Put distance from the people who doesn't accept you,  no remorse.   If they love you they will speak. "
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ My thoughts exactly!
Doesn't sound like the two of you are compatible if neither are willing to compromise. 
I was hanging out watching football with some buddies and my straight married friend asked what that noise was.  He thought it would be funny to change his message notification tone for all his texts to the Grindr noise.  He said that a couple of the male nurses at work have definitely started looking at him different.  He has since changed it back.  
"In my experience here are two factors:

1) Relaxation. Part of why it happened may be that it wasn‚Äôt expected to happen, he was just feeling good and into it and then it came about. I‚Äôd expect this to happen more as you are increasingly in tune with each other, but don‚Äôt force it.

2) Pushing limits! Every time I‚Äôve had an anal orgasm, it has been in the context of a top pushing me a bit past a point of discomfort. He‚Äôs fucking me hard, and I‚Äôm starting to spasm a bit and I‚Äôm on the verge of asking him to wait... he keeps going, and next thing I know I‚Äôm orgasming. So the rough sex in this case is probably enabling it. As well. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! Sounds like dynamite.
"
"You didn‚Äôt miss out on much.  It all sounds much more glamorous than it really is.  Lots of late nights, way too much alcohol, regret, health scares,men  lying about being in relationships and seeing the aftermath when they‚Äôre found out, being blamed for the cheating destroying the relationship.  Being lonely despite getting laid all the time, knowing that it‚Äôs just a physical act and once it‚Äôs over it‚Äôs over.  

Do I regret it? No.  Would I do it again if God forbid something happened between DH and I?  Not likely.  

Be glad with what you have.  The old grass is greener saying isn‚Äôt true.  Both sides of the pasture has problems, it just looks different because of your perspective.  "

"Good question, here's what I did!

1.) borrowed one of bf's anal toys and practiced what it felt like having something inside of me. It never ""hurt"" but didn't always feel comfortable...I told him I was feeling ready when inserting a toy felt easier and more comfortable. I personally just had to get used to the sensation!

2.) Day of, my bf took time to relax me: rubbed my back, rimmed me, fingered my hole a little bit and I communicated when I felt ready. I also douched the day of as well so I could feel comfortably clean

3.) I made sure he went slow going in, and when it went all the way in, I rocked my hips back and forth a little bit to get used to the feeling, he then started thrusting slowly and got faster and faster with it as I continued to loosen up

&amp;#x200B;

So that's how it went down for me! Slow process, but the key was how much my partner relaxed me before he put it in, I think that's what helped the most. Good luck to you!"
"Seems like you've got your answer. His loss, really. "

"no doubt. There is always a chance of getting played. I've got no expectations from it, it's just the first time I've done anything that bold. I'm fully aware it's his job to compliment everyone.

Lost my virginity to the pool boy!
"The first thought in my mind reading this title. How old are you and how long have you been out? Because I too use to be like this, simply because I didn't think I was gay, although everyone else around me had an idea. And the fact I was raised in a Roman Catholic family didn't help. Soo yea coming out was ok. And yes I cringed around the flamboyant guys and thought they were making a bad view for the community. 
I never found the drag queens attractive, and the transgenders just grossed me out. 
That was 11 years ago when I came out. I'm pansexual. I'm now married to a drag queen, who has recently came out as a woman (MtF). Needless to say I no longer cringe or think these fabulous people are a bad view to our community.
I think the only reason I had what you have was simply because I was still getting comfortable with being into men and I had to stop telling myself it's a sin and I'm going to burn in hell for it. And also I was hardly around the community, so of course I was uncomfortable when I decided to go out to a gay bar or club. So that's why I ask that question."
"I don't advertise it, but I'm not ashamed I am one. 

  I had a few straight friends who would always ask if I was top or bottom, liked to suck dick etc.  I think they did it to make me feel included as they talked about thier sexual adventures a lot .

I found a good way to end the conversation was to look directly in thier eyes and say ""your about 3 minutes for finding out"""
"Other sites generally infest my computer with pop up windows I can't shut, and I always have a vague sense the ""open web"" of porn is more dangerous ... Tumblr just felt like me browsing through my personal porn feed, I didn't feel a part of some creepy community of pervs, if that makes sense. "
"There‚Äôs a reason they have that saying, once a cheater, always a cheater."

"I was driving six hours to a concert so I stopped and checked into the motel and the desk clerk was so hot much taller than I and wearing a t-shirt showing big muscle chest. He gave me the key and I flirted subtly because I couldn‚Äôt be sure he would be interested but he said that he‚Äôd be at the desk all night and was bummed he couldn‚Äôt go to the concert.
I bought a shirt with the bands name on it at the concert and brought it back knocked on the door he let me in the reception desk. I gave him the shirt and said that I hope it would fit him. He took his work polo shirt off right in front of me and put on the t-shirt I gave him. It was tight but showed his muscles so nicely. 
I said good night and headed to my room. I was just getting comfortable and knock at the door. It was him with a bottle of Jameson and I knew. It was a great pounding of my ass until 5am when he went back to the front desk. 
I slept a few hours and went to check out but he wasn‚Äôt there only a woman so I didn‚Äôt feel right asking. I never saw him again."

"Your dad was a dick, and so was that man. Couldn't take a joke from a child. "

To those who enjoy this kind of rough play; that‚Äôs awesome! Either way, *communicate*. Make sure boundries are set where you want them, and both parties know what they are getting into."

"Like the gap across the grand canyon mate. The yanks have so many body shame and sexual fear issues, aversion to nudity...racial issues.. the list goes on.... wow.

I think it comes from the extreme prudish culture that is America, and how it makes such a big deal of sex."
"Maybe not so much the safer option. Feels like the ""straight male pleasing"" option."
"This is the only valid advice in this thread.
I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments making excuses and trying to normalize your partner‚Äôs behavior because of where he‚Äôs from. Ethnicity can‚Äôt be an excuse for abusive behavior.
Also I‚Äôve been in a very similar situation, but different country and different language, and this stopped happening to me. It might take a couple of reminders but don‚Äôt let it go or you‚Äôll be normalizing this behavior."
Got a gay gentleman over here. Something similar happened to me. Though I was the drunk one and he did push himself on me. And to this day I‚Äôm not 100% what happened. We both have completely different recollections of why happened in my bedroom that night. I should mention this is before I came out and I used to be very open to being gay when I got really drunk. 
"I‚Äôm with you on this, I‚Äôve never been into straight guys. Sure they‚Äôre attractive - they‚Äôre men after all - but once I know they‚Äôre straight I‚Äôve never been interested. 

There‚Äôs something very hot about men being into other men for me."
"Similar story. Crushed hard on a larger nerdy guy (Bear in the making) in early high school who sat next to me on the bus. I thought he was beautiful being into husky guys. 

Casual chitchat occurred and almost felt like flirting at times. 

Later that year he invited me to one of those after school, afternoon church night events for teens. I live in the South, but don't worry religion didn't get in the way.

I was flattered and nervous but ready to accept it being a friendly invite. I had no intention to go however, until a female friend of mine mentioned she was going too. My BFF at the time.

So we go, have a good time even though I'm not religious as it was more a teen hangout thing. We laughed and cut up between his friends and my own (my friends not being regulars).

By the end of the night he asks me to come outside the complex. He wanted to talk in private. My heart was racing, still holding back though trying not to get my hopes up.

We're alone in the parking lot, and the topic of relationships was brought up. We chitchat lightly about his past experiences before... He asks me is my BFF single. 

I was crushed. I should have knew what this was, I was only out in limited fashion so he knew if only lightly.

Needless to say, the BFF was taken and I bawled that night. He was my first IRL crush really that didn't seem totally out of the question of being gay or bi.

Woes of living in the South.

However! BONUS ROUND!

As adults we met up again through crossing friend circles. Being more experienced I drop hints I'm attracted. One morning after drinking and showering after staying over he was expressed Bicuriousity to me. 

We've been fuck buddies off and on since. So there's that at least. "

"OMG ikr, this is goals af! So romantic üòç keep us posted!"
"Spent $50 on uber for a 1 AM hookup. 

Nothing even happened because he wasn't feeling it. "
It definitely does. We are both different now than we were I our 20‚Äôs but I can‚Äôt have found a better man. It‚Äôs like winning the love lottery!
I'm not a fan of giving head. Bad gag reflex 'n all... so I love guys that are smaller than average because that's the only time I actually feel that I'm doing a good job. And I enjoy pleasing. Don't ever think that the size of your dick is a problem.

Anal sex isn't mandatory!!!
Try hooking up when the bars in your area close.  The people who didn't find anyone to go home with turn to grindr.  And they've been drinking so you have a shot with people who wouldn't normally talk to you LOL

"Well the thing is, a confrontation like this may make her realize she cannot *truly* guess at all who is and who isn't gay.

Maybe she will be more careful of putting herself in similar situations in the future."
Just the tip 
I‚Äôve been waiting for 12+ years for this sort of thing. Hard to find in a community that doesn‚Äôt prioritize it. 
"Just for finding out you are gay, he threw you out of the house? "
I showed him my earlier post this morning and the only thing he mentioned is he didnt want identifiable details that would get him harassed irl so I left out names and places and stuff. He also seemed flattered by the amount of support lol
15 minutes = infinit√© time in sex life years. 
"I‚Äôve said this before and I‚Äôll say it again. All of us are bisexual. Most of us don‚Äôt know it yet and have not explored the other sex. 

Im gay and was forced to marry a woman because of my religious parents. Now, I fell in love with my wife and enjoy having sex with her. I‚Äôve also become attracted to the female body because of my sexual experience with my wife. 

Sexuality is a beautiful thing; it‚Äôs a gift. Don‚Äôt be afraid of it; instead explore it. Try it, OP!"

Yesss like I felt like some of them were more real or passionate even. But also there was a lot of asian guys that were UNcensored haha.

keep talking with him! he sounds awesome. worry about the labels and what it means about your sexuality etc etc later and just see how he makes you feel.
"Sadly, a co-worker who met my guy said it was obvious because he's got about 80 pounds on me (edit: I'm a slim runner build, he's a gym rat who's obsessed with his arm muscles).

He is.

"Your husband is, at the very least, bisexual. The fact that he isn't opening up to you about it says a lot about how he feels. Sorry you're going through this but if it's any comfort, you can get out of it, and you can find someone who is going to commit themselves to you 100%. 

Stay strong, don't let yourself get too down, and most importantly, prioritize your needs. After all, you are your own number 1. Good luck :/

The options of size queens don't matter because they generally use Grindr inches and not real inches. 
"Yeh I am a total bttm for 15 yrs but in a LTR now and my SO like that too so I gave it a go and found out I really get into it. The sounds SO makes when dominated are pure sexual grunts like from our caveman ancestors its fucking primal!!! 

When your on top behind::

- Gently grab hair from the scalp, not from the ends, and use like a handle bar to control their head.

- Fish hook their mouth 

- Choke firmly until they let out a sexual moan, squeeze harder, they can moan, too much air, squeeze harder (always back off if any response is anything but their enjoyment and don't go fast ease into it)

- Grab them across their face, covering their eyes

- Put your thumb in their ass while fucking, use it like a prying tool, gotta open that hole up dont we??

- Spank.

- Grab both arms and put behind their back and hold them by the wrists

- Grab one arm and put him into a cop hold, leveraging arm until you feel resistance and hold it there, just be careful because you can legit dislocate his arm this way

When on top, he's in missionary::

- Front choke

- Reach into his mouth and grab him by the lower jaw and shove his face in the pillow. (I do this but mostly because I love my SO and when they look at me all I see is love and it takes me out the dom mood, so stop looking at me whore and take my dick you fucking bitch)

- Cover their eyes with one hand when making body contact 

- Hair Grab

- Try exploring their mouth, I get horny(er) when I can touch the inside of their mouth, like fishhooking, grabbing a cheek, etc.

- Hold down by the wrists above their head

Overall::

- Be aggressive overall, demand sexual acts while in the moment

- Talk dirty AF (whore, slut, bitch, in any combo; ""You like that dick in your hole you fucking cum whore, take that dick slut, yeh, your such a little bitch, etc!)

- Control, Control, Control; BE IN CHARGE! He wants it, so tell him to shut his dirty fuckin mouth and kneel the fuck down....NOW BITCH FUCK DO I HAVE TO SAY IT TWICE!!???

- Enjoy!

I would probably take it as a compliment. A random stranger thinks Im attractive enough to ask another attractive individual for their number. Self-esteem leveled up
I was in the clinic getting tested and didn‚Äôt silence my phone...and came across a Grindr ads on insta that had the text sound. All the guys in the waiting room turned and stared at me. So embarrassing. Trolling for dick at the std clinic üòÇ
This made me smile and blow air through my nose.
It‚Äôs okay if he laughs with his friend about it; shit happens I‚Äôd be happy that he‚Äôs so understanding he can immediately open up to someone else besides you about it and have a laugh. You really gotta look for the good on things if thats what you want around you 
"my first kiss happened when i was sixteen during a stupid game of spin the bottle with a twist using party dice. a straight guy that i had the biggest crush on landed on me and he rolled a kiss on the lips.

i was expecting a peck on the lips but he grabbed my hip with one hand and the back of my neck with the other and kissed me with tongue for what felt like a whole minute. after it was over he told me that he really liked it which made everything worse. that was six years ago going on seven at this point and to this day i haven't been able to kiss anyone because i get scared. scared because of a similar feeling.

what i'm trying to say is not getting the kiss is much less painful than actually getting the kiss then never getting the chance to do it again with that person. since then i've asked him to kiss me again and was rejected.

i'm still broken from it but hopefully i'll be able to move on from it one day."
"I wouldn't worry about that. But you know he wants to see you, and that you want to see him. Sounds like you're legs up on a lot of other people trying to figure out if their crush is in to them. Seize the confident little fucker by the ears and kiss the boy! "
"Some people will absolutely take offense. I don't see how it's different from saying you'd never date a pessimist, or someone who is religious, but apparently it's a big deal to choose sexual or romantic partners based on personality compatibility."
"Wear clothes that fit. No matter how expensive an item is, if it doesn‚Äôt fit you right it won‚Äôt look good. Take care of yourself, good skin care routine, getting regular haircut, working out (in my opinion, average is meh). Still many more to list but you get the point. People who looks like they‚Äôre not doing anything to look that good are actually doing a lot to look that good. Just subtle things but good turnout. "
