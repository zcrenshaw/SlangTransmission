Straight guys who are comfortable enough with their sexuality to entertain a few thirsty gays make me so happy.
"Coming out was a gift in itself. I got rid of so many toxic people in my life. The people who cared accepted me unconditionally, I even had friends work on it within themself and accept that there’s nothing wrong with it. "
"I would have just said, ""welp, I am gay, and fuck you."" And then walked off. "
"Fuck his parents, if you're making him happy then stay with him. They are the ones making him unhappy, not you."
"If you have misgivings then don’t do it. Some lines shouldn’t be crossed. I would ask myself what relationship is more important. Your sister or some good/bad/okay sex with her ex husband. 

I’d leave him alone. "
"Straight guys who are that comfortable with their sexuality like this are imho what “real men” are, not the ones who have to overcompensate and act all macho and tough. "

"It's the same thing as straight guys liking the same sort of thing with ""lesbians"" or anyone liking rape-fantasy stuff, or a dozen other categories.

As long as the people watching it can recognize that it's only porn, it's fine.

It's the assholes who expect real life to work that way that need to meet a rolled-up newspaper."
"I can’t imagine what your going through. Take care of yourself first and let me know if you need anyone to vent to. 

You deserved better than that. "
"Agree. OP, coming out to this guy could have produced 2 possible results: him shunning you (which would be no loss to you since it'd be toxic to have him in your life), or him taking a hard look at his prejudice and eventually softening (depending on how much he valued you to begin with).

Unless they're in a position to do you harm, there's no reason to be silent when homophobes make their views known."
"Thank you guys for all the responses. Im with him right now (its 9 AM, I came at 6) he was so happy, before he went to sleep holding my hand. 

Fuck his family, ill come anytime i can to comfort my poor baby. 

Edit: its now 2 PM, I left awhile ago. His family came at 11 AM, so I just pretended they weren't there and continued being lovey-dovey with him. 

This time they weren't as hostile, because hes actually conscious now (not like a few weeks ago) and they could see how calm he was with me around. 

I might go again at night, because hes shy about asking for help from the nurses and it has caused a few issues.

"Black guy here and yeah the black community are one of the worst when it comes down to lgbt people. It’s one of the reasons why a lot of guys go on the low to have sex with men. The way how we are talked about among our people is just disgusting. It hurts more when we hear the same people who claim to care about us talk so much crap about lgbt people, even worse when they have lgbt family or friends and they talk vile about them behind their backs. Black people do need to educate themselves more so on other issues. I know as a black gay man I’m worth nothing to my own people but you know what? I own myself at the end of the day. "
"My step father (since i was 1 year old)  is Jamaican and mostly follows Rastafarian ideals though he's not very religious. About a month ago I slept in bed at his house with my very gay very white ginger friend... With the door closed. I felt kinda uneasy about the whole thing and i just felt very strange being in bed with a white man in my parents house. My family sometimes says things about gay people that they think is funny but I sometimes find offensive, but Ive never felt that they were flat out homophobic or anything like that. Mom rolled us a blunt while dad cooked us breakfast. Color me shocked! Now they always ask about him and invites him over. "
"Being gay isn't about wearing certain clothes and doing things a certain way. I am not sure where you are meeting guys, but gay men come in all types. Don't change who you are to fit in."
"gay bar culture isn't all of ""gay culture"""
I have a whiff just to check if it's safe and clean to start sucking.
I honestly don’t have anything constructive to contribute. I just wanted to say how come my high school or college years were never this interesting LOL
Both from a social perspective and taking a cock up the ass.

"&gt; Coming out was a gift in itself. I got rid of so many toxic people in my life.

And that's delightfully typical. Just as coming out lifts a weight off oneself, it also acts to purge people whose presence is, or would become, stifling &amp; depressing. And you don't even have to figure out a way to let them down easily."

"FUCK HIS FAMILY!
Stay with your man! He wants you and you want him!
Oh this just occurred to me, speak with his doctor and explain to them your situation so you can avoid the parents going behind your back to the doctor and telling them that they don’t want you to be visiting him... "
"You really wanna suck a dick that’s been inside your sister? This has the potential to be a shit show. I say leave well alone, there’s plenty more dicks in the sea."
"He literally used you at the end. What a scumbag. He can go fuck himself. YOU can do better. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"Pence, if you are really worried about this, you should just resign."
"These ""who else"" kind of questions are pushing me to unfollow this sub!!"
"Nice, I admire your courage! What did you say to tell them that you were checking him out?"
"Yep. Just makes me love him that much more. No crush on him but he's cute as fuck, he can act and he's super sweet. Like... Come on. Why is he perfect?"
Trashy people are trash. 
"A very impractical fantasy I do have is what I would call penetrative cuddling.

Basically cuddling but having him inside me without necessarily thrusting in and out but just staying erect in me while spooning.

It sounds odd now that I put it that way lol but yeah that's a weird impractical fantasy of mine."
"For about 20 minutes, it's the most wonderful feeling in the world, nothing can come close to how warm, secure, safe and comforting it feels. Then it starts to get warm and stuffy, your arm starts to cramp and you kinda wish your partner would just roll over to his side of the bed and let you sleep but you don't wanna be a jerk so you just lie there staring at the wall."
"Honestly I’m in a similar position. Was with my ex for 4 and half years. He has bipolar and I’ve saved his life on multiple occasions, helped him through the grief of losing several family members, invested all my time and money into him and his home, gave up all my friends as he was jealous and thought I’d cheat etc.

Then he cheats. Twice. Then decides he thinks the grass is greener. He keeps the house (he inherited), the dog, everything. I move out broke and heartbroken. He treats me like shit and rubs in my face how well he’s doing at every opportunity, even sabotaging my first night out as a single guy again.

It’s shit."
"&gt; Being gay is inherently difficult.

I honestly think it all depends, where you were raised and live. I honestly didn't realize, till much later in life, how lucky I was to grow up in a very diverse
 city in North East Coast of the USA. Where being a cis gay male was like having green eyes. "
"We were just chatting and I said , “I’m going to be honest with you, I was checking you out.” He said he’d noticed me smile at him. The more I think about it I wish I’d have at least got his name.  "
"On the flip side, I am an LGBTQ+ person and I’m fed up with our community’s ignorance on race issues."
"In fact, speak out against them. Do not give them the comfort or normalization of silence and civil disagreement. 

They do not afford the same for us. "
Yikes! People are shit sometimes. You were an innocent 9 yr old kid... I'll bet you are strong as Hell now
Isn't that what the sims is marketed for? 
Came to ensure the top comment started with fuck that. Good job. 
"Thank you. I've told the story in some form to a handful of friends, but writing it all out anonymously did help. I might take you up on the offer to vent, especially around the holidays when it will get more lonely... Hopefully I feel a lot better by then. "
"&gt; His mom would also blame me for ""teaching him the gay lifestyle"" and **she claims this was God's way of trying to guide him**.

This is all I need to see to know that his parents are terrible people, which to me makes it all the more important that you *do* continue to visit him in the hospital."
It must be hard to be gay in Russia. It's already hard here in Brazil. Stay safe!
You'll definitely pull less numbers when trying to date but in all likelihood you'll pull better quality dudes. Responsibilities like kids tend to make the crazy/self-centered boys run for the hills.
Is gay porn lying to us about the amount of gay sex in the military?
You too huh... You gonna make a post about it? I think I know the perfect title.
"which is more important to you, being with your boyfriend in his time of need, or avoiding his parents annoying behavior?"
Fuck his dad.
"You should meet up with the other 10,000 guys that post this same exact thread every day "
"For the same reason there are ""gays for trump"" or ""Mexicans for trump"" or ""women for trump."" Wealtheir people, or middle class folks who just don't like paying higher taxes, choose to believe conservative (on the right) candidates will be good for their pockets. I have some family in Brazil and their reasons for Bolsonaro are as follows: ""violence is through the roof, a good criminal is a dead criminal...go to work and stop taking my money to send 'lazy nig...' to college, etc..."" They don't even realize how racist, homophobic or misogynistic they are. And that bolsonaro will perpetuate policies to create further inequality and violence against marginalized people."
"Thanks guys. I'd thought most of my mates would react this way but thought he'd be understanding and laugh. Can't believe he said that. I won't come out to him until I move away. I am gay and want Boyfriend, I just don't want thr hate. Thanks for your supporr gaybros "
"As a straight dude, if they don't accept you as you are then fuck them. You 100% don't need those people in your life especially the constant stress of worrying how they would react if they knew. "
Tell him no cause your dog prefers to bottom.
"He's so sweet, and I love it that he does this... but for me personally, I'd be too shy to ask a guy I have a crush on to pose this way 😂

Like I am all about Henry Cavill, but I wouldn't have the nerve to ask him lmao"
"Also, if you aren’t registered, please do that ASAP! The deadlines are fast approaching in most states. "
Ffs why am I so scared. Even moving away and doing it seems like somewhat of a shitty move ffs. Please encourage me guys to do it while still home.and to others to show that we're not alone. I would never be at this stage without a/gaybros thank you everyone!!!!
The relationship won’t work because he does not sound mature enough to be able to maintain an open relationship 
This is honestly something that I think about more than I should. I wish Netflix had some privacy settings for shared accounts. 
He’s the last person on Earth that should be making you feel stupid.  Time for a chat with him bud.  
"I was always this way even when i was ""mostly"" straight. Machismo is the opposite of manly to me. ""Alphas"" are a huge turn off and IMO usually toxic. "
"What do you like to do? Play video games? Watch sports? Going to concerts? Play bowling? 

My suggestion to you is, if you can’t join these people - then make a new group! 

Go on Facebook or meetup and create a group in your area. Call it something like “Out Gaymers” or “Out Sports Watchers” and specify that this is an LGBT... group that meets every other week or every month, etc and is intended to be a place to make friends, play some games, get competitive, etc.

Then start advertising it in the apps or at these bars. Make friends that way. 

Yes, there are openly gay men that love bar going and do their own thing. 

There are also openly gay men that just like watching sports, or just like playing video games, or just like catching Pokémon at random poke stops. 

You’ll find your niche. 😁
And if not, then create one. "
real wholesome shit 😤 y’all are cute af 
"Me and the boyfriend do that, not impractical at all. "
"Before he met you he didn't know who he was. Because of you, he has been able to find his true self. Unfortunately, his true self turned out to be a selfish asshole. You weren't to know that when you first met him. You drew a short straw - I'm really sorry. What a kick in the pants. You should score 'do-er up-ers' off your list. Next time, find a guy who has his shit sorted out - someone who doesn't need you, but wants to share his life with you. You will do it - it will get better and better. Take care. "
"Haha, approached in person, social media, or apps? I said that when I start using apps, I'm just gonna swipe (or whatever) for whoever I find attractive and whose bios are relatable. Don't sell yourself short, I know it's easy to do that. Don't be like the guy down below:

&amp;#x200B;

**1:** ""*He looks too attractive, he'll never go for someone like me... Left swipe""*

**2:** ""*Why did this attractive guy match with me? He must be a catfish or is trying to take pity on me... Unmatch""*

....

**3:** "".....*Another night alone..........*

"He's an iceberg, mate.

There's so much under there you can't see. Some of it you will never see.

"If you have doubts that already an indicator by your concious that this is the wrong thing to do. Why would you want to create drama when there's absolutely nothing to gain. Why not consider how your sister would feel about this, if you care about her keep your distance. "
#THATS WHEN YOU KISS HIM BACK (young gays are dumb)
to some extent yes. the shared experiences of struggle with their sexual identity does create a common glue that lets gays relate to each other better as a community and therefore form a group culture and identity. It's pretty loosely defined though

"I came in expecting some bashing on femme gays, was pleasantly surprised.

The whole thing with Shawn Mendes and how the gay community, in particular stan community, has been treating the guy is absolutely trash, annoying and immature. they're teasing and accusing him of being gay based on his mannerism/vibe. i don't know if they're self-aware to realize that by doing this, they help pushing and enforcing the outdated stereotypes on gay men even more. they're doing the same thing lots of straight people have been doing for ages now. no one should assume a guy is gay based on anything other than being attracted to men. 

As a person who hates stereotypes, this has been really annoying and i hope it stop soon."
"This is scenario one. 

The other scenario is, you get into bed, get up close to him and one or two of you gets a boner. Then the other is like “are you hard” then the next thing you know you’re hard. Then the next thing you have a dick in your mouth.

"&gt;It’s one of the reasons why a lot of guys go on the low to have sex with men.

  
Sadly, this clandestine behavior is a major contributor to the much higher-than-average HIV transmission rate among gay African-American men (as compared to their Caucasian counterparts)."
I live with my partner and I’m out to my friends so yeah?
"Sounds like the best thing you could do is run far, far away. "
"Hooked up with a dude. Next time he asked me to act younger. I was suspicious and pretended to be empathetic and friendly and made him tell me how young he was into and what he's done. He told me he raped a girl under 12. I'm autistic so I remembered his numberplate from the first hook up. I reported him and they couldn't do anything since the parents hadn't reported it and it was just hear say even though I had screenshots. This is in Australia. They let me know his expensive car was vandalised. I wonder who did it bc it wasn't me. I kinda hope it was the cops going vigilante lol. 

Haunts me I already hooked up with him. Haunts me he's still out. Haunts me I know he's in contact with children. Haunts me he has no regret."
"Or, personality/company pending, use it as a source for banter and bonding.

But don't hit that."

"Thanks, you too buddy "
"LMAO. You think that THAT is a severe downward curve?

&amp;#x200B;

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA

&amp;#x200B;

That's a tasty looking dick. Good size, good angle for doggy style. It's well within the range of a normal penis.

&amp;#x200B;

I would give it an 8.5/10"
"its a lot less severe to fantasize about a straight crush being gay than it is to fantasize about rape imo

another point:

a lot of straight porn is all ""slutty cousin begs for it"" or ""stripper and her daughter both like corn cobs up their pussy"" or ""horny stepmom milf"" or whatever

most ""straight guy"" gay porn is just in the title, and people click on it because the thumbnail looked hot"
That’s weird. I thought it was common knowledge that men can be raped etc by women (even if of course it doesn’t happen nearly as often). 
Send shirtless pics before meeting up. Boom. Problem solved. 
Awww that’s so nice! Your parents sound beyond awesome. Congrats!
"This isn’t impractical. Me and my ex used to do this after sex, fall asleep with him still in me. It was very nice and weird enough, romantic. Ultimate spooning, like the two becoming one. Now I’m a little embarrassed for admitting it out loud. Sounds weird writing it out. But it wasn’t weird it was great!"
"You're husband has grindr on his phone, you weren't using it to add a third and you thought nothing of it? I think it's time you two had a long conversation."
absolutely.
Good luck
"1. I guess Oleg Tinkoff is somewhat out. 2. I’m not sure what you mean but maybe sharing a wardrobe with my boyfriend? I wouldn’t try to seduce you but there is hornet app so I believe you would have a good time ;) (grindr is not popular). There are gay bars and lesbian bars in my city, one venue is about 25 years old, I guess it’s a stable business never running out of customers. 3. With a heavy Russian accent 4. I was born when the ussr collapsed, from what I know I suppose yes the attitude towards lgbt is much better.
"
"Lol like, could you get stuck like that?"
Thank you. Work keeps me busy during the week and that helps too..
"That's worse. Hang in there and I'm sure you will be fine in the long run. In my case, I don't even know what I'll do differently if I lived through this all over again... What I did (and what you did) reflects on us and our character. What he (and your ex) did reflects on them. Maybe I'd have waited longer before making a huge financial decision like buying a house. But I'd still be the same person who trusted, loved and helped a person that needed help."

"Many questions come to mind 1) Russia’s reputation for being a homophobic place is well known but, has any public figure been brave enough to come out and set a positive example? 2) What about some of the positives of being gay in Russia - how would you seduce me if I visited you in Vladivostok ? Are there bars or places to hang out publicly? Hehe 3) How would you talk dirty in Russian? 4) Is the attitude towards the LGBT community different vs Soviet Times? P.S I know you guys are going through serious stuff so that’s why I’m keeping some questions light ;-)"
"Hey man imma share a story that I’m pretty ashamed of. 

I was in the army when don’t ask don’t tell was repealed. I’m big on shock comedy (saying horrible things for a laugh). My best friend in my unit asked me how I felt about DADT being repealed. 

I jokingly said some pretend homophobic shit. It was mocking people serious about it, but so dead pan he couldn’t tell. 

He came out to me a full year later crying, saying he was so excited to come out after DADT was repealed, but him not wanting to lose my friendship forced him back in the closet. 

I felt like trash, deservedly. 

Talk to your friend openly. That’s my advice. "
The trash takes itself out!
"I want a loving, caring boyfriend who doesn't care what I look like and who loves me unconditionally.

"Tbh, I would fuck myself stupid if I could. "
"I feel like this opinion is going to be unpopular but here goes. No one else really needs to know that you're gay, if you're an effiminate man then the people around you probably already suspect that you are gay anyway so officially coming out will probably change nothing.

Just do you. Life is too short for you to not make an effort to live your best life. Get yourself out there, meet some guys and find one that makes you happy.

You said yourself that its safe to come out now. So whats stopping you? Your future is waiting."
Id say 10/10
I was ugly with no friends so that might explain it. 
It makes me uncomfortable as a gay guy. I have no trouble admitting a crush on Tom Holland but I'd feel kind of pathetic having him or any straight guy pose like this with me.
"I like both the submissiveness of it, like feeling my boyfriend pound me into the mattress and keeping my legs open as wide as they'll go. Or feeling him try to push as far as he can into me until his pelvis is flush with my ass. I also really like how dominating it can be, when I'm on top riding him and controlling how much of my ass he gets, watching his eyes roll back when I tease him with just keeping the tip in before thrusting down and taking him all in

So yeah, as you can tell I can't decide I'm more of a sub bottom or power bottom LOL"
DAE in this community for homosexuals like how their boyfriend smells?

"Don’t be down on yourself. Reading what you wrote, you sound like a badass. You’ve managed to get through all of these struggles and still come out on the other side alive. Life is rough, and it sounds like it’s especially rough for you, but you’re still kicking. You’ve worked hard and fought your way to this point. Keep fighting and I’m sure you can work your way to where you want to be. Everybody here wants you to succeed. You have a whole community who is here to support you. If you ever need someone to talk to, just message me. I’ll do what I can to help, even if it’s listening. 🙂"
"LMAO!!! So your boyfriend wants to fuck around while you stay faithful?? If you don’t kick this asshole to the curb IMMEDIATELY you deserve whatever misery is coming your way.  This is harsh but true.

Does anyone here go out or have any human contact?
"Really dependent on the guy. Some dudes smell great, while others...not so much. "
"Good to know.
Now all I need is to find a bf to do this with and then I can finally tick this off my bucket list lol"
"I came out in 1972. 

Electroshock was the newest cure at the time.  Leaving a gay bar by yourself was an invitation to get beat up and the cops didn't care.  You could get fired in all 50 states just for being gay.  You could be arrested for having sex with your partner if they were of the same sex.  Police actually raided people's homes.  Gay bars were raided all over the country unless they were owned by the Mafia and they paid off the cops.

Today we have marriage equality and many gay people think that is equal rights.  But you can still be fired, just for being gay, in 27 states.  Not quite equal.

My favorite sister was the best.  She tried to hook me up with her gay friends.  My oldest sister said she had no problem with the emotional aspect of it but the physical was uggie.  I told her I would handle all the physical aspects.  My father accepted that I was gay in his 80's, which for a 100% Irish Catholic is fast."

"Well, I do for cute stories and also to learn few stuff I guess because I have a closeted Gay brother who has only come out to me.

"I did this with my at the time Jamaican boyfriend. I went back home with him. Me: tall euro type. Back to the farm in Bog Walk for a night before Kingston. They had pause at first. But then they realized what was happening. The following morning things were calm and by evening time his dad gave me the symbolically easy task of climbing to the lowest rung of the tree to grab my own coconut. He laughed and when I retrieved it he sliced it open with his cutlass and poured that overproof in for me. He was surprised when I could drink it down.


We’ve since broken up but his family has forever since acknowledged and respected his lifestyle. It’s just a matter of familiarity. "

"Teasing is only fun when you're both laughing, and there's a solid foundation of trust and respect underneath it all. This wasn't that.  
  
Honestly it would be a dealbreaker for me, too."
"I’ve pondered this question for a while now, and although I am not a Trump supporter, this is the conclusion I came to. 

So first we need to realize that people have different priorities in their lives which effect how they vote. Personally when I am choosing who to vote for in an election (I’m Canadian so I have a few choices) I write down what issues are important to me and rank them from most important to least important. Than I look at each parties platform and see where they stand on each issues. But when I’m making my decision I am not only considering how many policies view we have in common, but if we have my important issues in common.  Like lets say I agree with Party A on 8 out of 10 policy issues, but we disagree on my two most important issues, while with Party B I only agree with 6 out of 10 issues, but we agree on my top issues, therefore I am going to vote for party B. 

So what I am getting at is that a lot of people who are active in the LGBT community, LGBT issues are their number one voting issues. Therefore if a party doesn’t have a favorable position they won’t be able to support that party.  

Where as for a right leaning LGBT person, their top issues may be economic/tax policy, foreign policy,  gun laws, abortion policy, etc... Obviously (at least I presume) LGBT rights will still be on that list just a little further down.  
So in order to advance what they believe is most important they must make a compromise. There is no party which will ever fully align to your own values and beliefs. And that compromise is the Republican Party. I am sure if there was a party out there with the same foreign and economic policy, but was more pro LGBT that person would have no issue voting for that party. 

Furthermore, I think there a compounding factor at play here as well. People often vote from a me centred  perspective, and primarily consider the impact which the party/person they are voting for will have on their life. So someone might ask themselves “So what if Transgender people can’t serve in the military? It doesn’t effet me. So what if the Trump administration doesn’t recognize pride? I’m not a huge fan of pride anyways.” 
As you can see, what you believe is critically important, is easily dismissible for these people. So its not going to have any bearings on how they vote.   

This obviously opens them door to discussing how we could get people to think more about the societal consequences of their votes (or if we should in the first place). 

But at the end of the day, a Gay farmer in Wisconsin who is struggling economically and sees international trade as the source of his hardship will almost always vote Trump. And that doesn’t mean he has internalized homophobia, it doesn’t mean that he hates LGBT people and it doesn’t mean he’s stupid and uneducated, and it most certainly doesn’t make him deplorable. 

Notwithstanding, what I just explained, I am dearly certain that yes there are gay men who hate women, or are horribly racist and who support the republicans for that reason. But those are a small minority of the LGBT people who voted for Trump. 

Anyways, I hope this all made sense to you and gave you some insight into how other people might approach the world and elections. Again, this is me putting myself in their shoes and trying to understand how they see the world using rational thought and a sound mind. "

I've been the white guy the black male musicians are not really paying attention to because I'm working for the studio in a technical capacity, not directly with or for them, and I've heard what they say. They talk shit about LGBT folks and think it's hilarious. It comes across as a way for them all to confirm their hetero masculinity to one another. It's very fucking depressing and discouraging to hear. I worked with one black gay producer who was out to me, and he told me not to say anything to out him because it would destroy his credibility.  "
"congrats, its not easy for some people to chat up a hot guy in public. Sounds like u were polite and friendly, so whats to be upset about. If a dude isn't gay or interested he just has to say no thanks like your guy did, no harm done. Better luck next time !!"
"I'm white &amp; bi but dated a gay black guy and it was so sad how his own family would sometimes taunt and insult him just for being gay. He lived with his old religious grandma who seemed to usually tolerate his presence but not much more than that. He has the gay voice but was always so quiet &amp; shy because I could tell he had been socially conditioned to be ashamed of it. 

I would've stood up for him but he had very large brothers who could kick my ass and were subtly threatening towards me, so I usually just had him come over or picked him up to go to my place. He got away from his shit family by joining the military."
It’s high school. Go for it. It was just a hookup anyway. It’s not like you dated
"I came out when I was 24. First person I came out to was my mother, who cried screamed and disowned me. Then over time I came out little by little to my cousins and family. My sister said she always knew and accepted me while my uncles all called me various names when they found out. I'm still only close with my sister and my cousins and hope one day my mom will call me back. 

My husband came out when he was 17 to his wonderful mother and everyone in his side of the family (with the exception of his aunt) loves and supports him. I couldn't have asked for better in laws. "
"Being in the closet does mean less exposure to education on the subject as you’re less likely to talk to your doctors, ask questions. Also it means more risky behavior as you can’t maintain relationships with partners you trust. "
" I agree completely however it’s not just the black community it’s also the south Asian community, I have family from both, and neither of them seem accepting of LGBT people. 

It’s so sad hearing words like ‘chi chi man’ etc, it’s so sad not being able to speak to any other POC as they are to afraid to come out. I really hate it. I wish our community would be more accepting of its brothers and sisters and children. We need to make a POC group 😂😂"
"As a young gay male, I often forget how much I have to thank previous gay generations for their work. They’re truly the brave and tough ones. Like, I can’t even imagine what being a transgender was like 10-15 years ago (being a transgender is *already* so tough these days). Being openly gay or bi a decade ago must have been so scary .. So much of the older generation has fought for all of our rights - and are still fighting

Love is Love 💕"
"I usually do, but I will advise you not to, because one of those guys that I almost swiped left because they were “out of my league” (but ultimately decided fuck it I will go right) is actually the person I am currently dating, swipe right to every person you like, you never know what can come out of this."

Americans... how can this be that with each vote you get yourself into even worse situation?
It does get kind of annoying when discussions about gender in society are aggressively hetero-centric. 
The only thing you should be worried about is why that isn't in me
"Yes and no. LGBT in Russia is very politicised and she did it where there was that hype of the new gay propaganda ban. Once I witnessed a social experiment where two guys were walking the street back and forth holding hands and kissing each other, mostly they were ignored, some giggled but nothing much (I believe it was a prank or an experiment because they were trying too hard to be noticed). They were huge though, muscled up."
"Considering that this is how men naturally look, yes I would say it’s normal. "
"Quite a few actually. Some are out, others prefer to stay discreet."
"America is one of the most litigious societies on the planet. Suing businesses over the design of their buildings  is our bread and butter. So every single teeny tiny risk is designed out of all new construction. What if someone got stuck inside for ten minutes and missed their bbq? What if someone died of a heart attack while eating a cheeseburger in there and it needed to be opened from the outside? What if there was a fire? What if someone was doing something illegal in there? What if xyz.....

Also, after wwii there was a massive construction boom in America. All the contractors which had been making standardized material for the military turned around and just made the same shit for civilians. In *some* pre wwii public buildings with minimally refurbisbed bathrooms you can see the difference, namely stalls with actual walls that go to the floor and little panels that cover the door gaps. Not very common though because of all the retrofitting that had to be done across the country for the ADA. I guess we just got used to it - don't look directly through the gaps but rather use your peripheral vision, if you're tall don't stand where they could even see the top of your head, etc "

"Gays who call literally everything internalized homophobia and have some snarky catty meme/reply for everything are exactly the type of guy the stereotype refers to. So you're kinda just proving the point of the guys that you're trying to make fun of who don't relate to ""stereotypical"" gays and feel the need to differentiate/distance themselves from them."
"He said he raped a girl under 12 and very obviously got off on the fact. He even mentioned it was painful for her. If someone's bullshitting about penetrative rape on someone so young I don't give a shit about their car. 

I have nothing against a pedo who doesn't act on their desires, I'll never empathise with one that does. "
On the lips?
"Was a little embarrassed to show him, but I did (he had asked for ""less clothed pictures""). I took a few shots in the mirror and sent it. Then I threw my phone across the bed and expected the worst.

Then this hot dude, with the rugged tattooed chest, six pack, and veiny biceps for days, said I was too hard on myself and he thought my doughey body was sexy. I was shocked.

Planning on meeting him sometime this week. Dude is so freaking hot and he seems to have a good personality too, so I can't wait. Thanks for the advice!"

"To be honest, if you followed up reasonably by texting to say you had a really good time and then make fun of the fact you chopped your finger off then I don't see any reason why you wouldn't get another date. While what you did was no doubt shocking to see, it's not like you did anything nasty to him or exposed any horrendous character flaws. I once accidentally threw a bowling ball at a guy and we still carried on merrily."
"Okay but your message ISNT that men can be raped or assaulted or that one group has issues that are treated as more important by feminists. Your post, OP, says “your tactics of emphasizing women’s perspectives and oppression invalidates men’s perspectives.”

That’s like saying focusing on gay men’s rights to live without fear of a hate crime invalidates a straight person’s right to live without fear of a hate crime. 

Both gay men and straight men could be victims of a hate crime but wanting to emphasize protections for gay people doesn’t mean a straight person couldn’t experience that too.

If you don’t consider yourself a feminist, you have no interest in protecting men (like feminists do)— you’re just interested in silencing women."

"Gay is not a personality though, act how you feel comfortable and be true to yourself.

"Pop culture loves the Pygmalion story, but its usually not a good idea to buy a fixer-upper boyfriend.  There is a real danger they decide to flip on you after you've put in all the upgrade effort.

Look, I'm still with my guy after 18 years, but I'd be lying if I said the initial disparity in income and ""life stage"" wasn't a huge challenge.  He had a B.S. degree when we first started dating but was also very much ""under employed"", while I was making six figures.  What followed was years of me paying the basic necessities (rent/mortgage, utilities, etc) while he pursued first a Masters and then a Ph.D.  It took over 12 years but he finished his degree, is working in his chosen field and grossing more than I am.  

We made it work, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't struggle at times with resentment over the lost opportunities... mostly around not being able to afford travel in the way I would have had I been single or with someone already on a good career path.  Ce la vie... life is about choices and I'm happy with mine.

I guess the difference might have been that he largely did it all on his own, with only the most basic ""necessities"" support from me.  I'm convinced he would have achieved what he did with or without my help... one way or another.  Emotionally, he is still the same person I met.  Kind, hard-working, confident, a bit hard-headed at times... but then so am I.

This is going to hurt for a while, but don't let it turn you off relationships completely.  You did a good thing.  If it's any comfort he's probably going to find the single life is really shitty and someday realize what an ass he was.  Hopefully by that time you'll have moved on and found a worthy partner.  "
"&gt;A lot of the men seem like cardboard cut outs

But they're not though. If you see them that way, it says more about you than them. If you look at another human being and see acollection of stereotypes, that's a kind of prejudice. It's a totally normal prejudice - everyone does it. But it's still healthy to recognise it and think about what it is and where is comes from. "
Also agreed.
Gays love this situation
"I'm not a trump supporter. But I know a few gay dudes who are. Permit me to answer for them as j have had many conversations with these guys.

Even though they are not rich, they like the idea that one day they will be rich.  Hence they support tax breaks for the top. 

They don't like the idea of paying for other healthcare.

What about lgbt rights? Yes, they care about these rights, but they do not think there are enough haters to roll back these rights. 

In other words, they have no problem with cheering for the other team knowing that there are enough of us on this side to keep fighting for our cause.

I don't agree with their view... I don't even respect their view. But that's how it is."
You haven't done anything wrong. Porn is his new lover. You have been left in the dust. Please consider your options for a better life. Good luck.
"He shouldn’t have hit you, he should’ve dumped you right then and there. Sorry but that’s fucked up."
Lot’s of fantasies (and porn) are horrifying. 
"Sexual fantasy has elements of exploration (""Straight Guys Dared to Kiss"") and power exchange (""Straight Guys Behind Bars""). The unobtainable creates desire (""Here's Yet Another Person You'll Never Have Sex With—Having Sex!""). If pornography was 100% about normal and routine sexual transactions it would be dull. ""Dumpy Fry Cook Rubs One Out In 80 Seconds So He Can Fall Asleep"" ain't news."
"I'm guessing it's the feeling of a clothed bulge against the back of his neck that gets him turned on. He probably has memories of something a friend he liked sitting on his shoulders and he could feel his friends dick on his neck. 

The other guy just wanted to suck your dick while you enjoyed a smoke. I've received blow jobs on my balcony while I sipped a whiskey and smoked a cigar. I'm guessing you're guy had a kink for servicing. "
"my main sims are self-made (as in, covered in custom content I made myself) deer-men who are not only twin brothers but also lovers with a relatively complicated back story

I think people should do what they want to do and like what they want to like up to the point where it harms them or others. 

Also, since it's relevant and I somehow only just realized, here's a video I did where I talk about The Sims, sexuality, and gaming/sexuality/representation/identity in general.

"Lady Gaga went to Russia in 2012/2013 and created this huge protest against the Russian government for their stance on gay rights. She got banned from the country though. 

You can be gay in Russia. You can even use gay apps like Grindr. The problem is that you can’t go out in public showing affection for your gay partner. In other words, keep it between yourselves in the bedroom."

"The experience wasn't too bad honestly. I didn't go straight to his place and fuck though. We met up outside, and spent some time getting to know each other before getting to business. I highly recommend knowing some basic information about the guy first: name, age, interests, etc. It feels better knowing that my first time wasn't with a total stranger but with someone I decently liked. "
"I get where you are right now. This fucking sucks. 

That said, it is essential to keep a long-view of history. As Barack Obama is fond of quoting MLK ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."" This has happened before. Moments of progress are met with moments of backlash where we lose some of the advancements of the past. Yet each time this has happened, the forces of progress win and overcome the backlash. 

We are facing a backlash now. We will lose some of the advancements, but you cannot despair. In the end we will overcome, but to get there we need to fight. "

"Russia is a mess. There are civil rights violations because there’s no developed civil society. When people don’t value their rights they don’t stand for them. Now I don’t even mean lgbt, but for example ecology, infrastructure, adequate problem solving. That’s Russian mentality - when people see a hole in the road they don’t demand on repair even though they pay road taxes, they just drive carefully. There’s been a rise of civil consciousness lately, that’s a good trend, but it is still weak and many just choose to leave. 

Some media hunt for catchy headlines and breathtaking stories. Some observe positive trends taking place in Russian society. If you compare criticism coming from western media and criticism coming from independent Russian media (Dozhd for example, Дождь) you would be surprised how harsh the latter is."
I learned basic sentences but then was too busy with work to learn more. It didn’t help that he wasn’t interested in tutoring me. 
"What *exactly* did you get banned for? I'd like to see the comment because you strike me as a rather abrasive person. I wouldn't be surprised if you got banned for how you expressed your message rather than the message itself. I've never been to /r/feminism but it would seem unlikely to me that they would ban someone solely for saying all these things had happened to them.

I've seen you post before and you seem like a bit of a reactionary, which is what makes me think you might be stretching the truth here to make yourself look fully innocent to us."
Can confirm this 50/50 chance
"Lol usually guys seeking non-scene guys are usually too judgemental which is equally repulsive.

If you actually want to get a chance of meeting a DTE guy, then do something else than grindr and tinder. Hobby groups, leisure centres, recreation parks, gym, volunteering, networking, etc. Yes its going to take time to sift through straight guys, but gay guys with a life will actually be pursuing things outside of sex. 

Follow your passion, interests, and communities you care about."

If he wasn’t hot you wouldn’t be asking this question. Let’s be honest lol
Shrug. I’ve had hookups where I slept over and then we got brunch the following morning. And I’ve had hookups that ended the second semen left my body. It just depends on the vibe.

"I mean, when I'm horny I want another man to stick a dick in me.  It isnt really logical, but hey what works works right?"
He’s friendly. And he’s in your neighborhood. 
"Anything you've done has the potential to produce blowback. After all, what's acceptable under today's standards, may not be acceptable tomorrow. Just look at #Metoo. As you progress in your life, if you want to be a public figure, you have to recognize that and constantly be thinking of previous acts, how they measure up, and organizing defenses.

That said, on this particular issue of nudes, I think the general public doesn't care about that as much as they used to. ""Let those amongst us who hasn't sent a dick pic cast the first stone."" I think Jesus said that. I think if a situation like that ever came up, the best advice would be to say something along the lines of ""That was a personal communique, not meant for public consumption. It was unkind of that person/3rd party to disseminate that picture. I don't regret taking the picture, nor do I apologize for having a sex life.""

That works if the picture is just a regular nude. Now, if it's one where you're covered in cum with your tongue outstretched, you basically have to use the same defense, but realize that the general hetero public will have less tolerance for that.

As far as my own personal feelings on the matter, it would not bother me at all. Like, it really bothered me when some less-reputable news sites were going on and on about Trump's dick size after Stormy Daniels called it ""a tiny mushroom."" That's none of my fucking business. I care much more about the impeachable offenses and shit-brained policies than I do about his dick size. 

It should be acknowledge, my viewpoints on sex are much more permissible than the general public. "

There is no hope. Just get a cat and watch Golden Girls reruns safely at home like me. 
"Once I hooked up with this dude who liked my cat, who is unusually friendly. Non-cat people love her. He’d text me about her a lot. I blocked him. Eventually he created a new profile to ask about my cat. For her sake, I’m glad we moved out of that apartment."
"I was very similar to your boyfriend for some time with my fiance. I'm absolutely not defending the way he's acting AT ALL just giving you my reasoning for pulling away. 

Mine was absolutely all my fault, I was the problem 100%. It's easier to just list the reasons I was so messed up for so long. 

Low self esteem, porn addiction, not fully understanding my sexual position, not exploring our kinks, not TRULY explaining how I felt to my man, thinking anal was the only thing he wanted, DEPRESSION, being fucked up from toxic Christian upbringing, COMMUNICATION....real, authentic communication. 

I can't tell you how to fix your problems because they are likely not the same. I can only suggest a hardcore sit down and lay everything out on the table, how his actions are hurting you, where you can compromise, watching less porn of that's his problem (tough one), asking if he needs legit mental help for other areas in life, discussing how  this is absolutely normal and there are sooooo many options to fix your love life. 

If he's not willing to work on it you definitely need to reevaluate things. If he can't satisfy your needs you need to discuss opening up the relationship if that's something your interested in. If he truly loves you but can't find arousel with you and you truly love him but he won't satisfy you then you could really benefit from adding an occasional third. However if you don't fully trust each other it isn't recommend. We play TOGETHER with others and it keeps things spicy for both of us but also makes me appreciate how perfect my man is no matter how fun sex is with another is. Other guys may give me thrills but I absolutely could never imagine anyone loving me how he does. 

I hope all this helps or at least came out as I intended. 

Best of Love!

This. It's not universal to gay guys. I've seen women and girl friends who post things like this on people's live stories. The only difference is that they are not famous or called out for it because they are women and somehow it's sexual misconduct/innapropriate only when a guy does it.
"There are two versions of it: People who understand it's a fantasy, and people who genuinely believe straight guys are one good bj away from being their BF.

The latter is absolutely as creepy as you say and more than a little rapey into the bargain. Also, and this might just be confirmation bias or whatever in action, but it seems it's a view that's disturbingly common in our community - far more so than other equivalents (""converting"" lesbians cos dicks too good).

"Jamaican-Canadian here.

Am I you, OP? You've said each and every single word that I've been thinking to my self for the past 2 weeks. Although my immediate family (minus my father) is definitely more liberal and I'm happy for that, the majority of my extended family definitely falls into that ""black homophobic norm"" if you wanna call it that. I've noticed that it seems mostly contained to the older generations (65+) of my family, thankfully...

It's pretty depressing, but I do my best to keep my head held high and go about my life knowing that their opinions are hypocritical and non-sensical and just downright whack. Half of my extended family are dysfunctional individuals themselves anyway - they would do better to focus on their own messy lives than attempting to call me out for me being queer lol

However, I do live in Canada, so I'm very grateful for that too. If I lived in Jamaica things would be far different."

"First of all the government and the public in Russia are parallel words. It feels like the government is detached from the population. The government doesn’t really care about anything lgbt, they introduced that controversial “gay propaganda” ban (which doesn’t work, we all have access to Netflix, google etc), it had a big resonance which served them well and covered other unpopular laws they signed. As for people - some are homophobic and vocal about it, some are not. "
