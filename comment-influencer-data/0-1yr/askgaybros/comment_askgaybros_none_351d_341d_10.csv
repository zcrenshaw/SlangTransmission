I read like 12 comments before I realized what sub I was in. I was like “why are only gay guys having sex with their roommates”
"As a bisexual guy I've found that on average guys are much better. I've taken girls on dates, and had them give me head almost as a ""thank you"" and it was horrendous. Guys I enjoy because you can tell they're *legitimately hungry for dick*. I feel like I'm practically doing then a favor by letting them swallow my loads. Not to mention they have larger mouths which is perfect if you're a larger man than average. "
swallow next time 
"This. As a teacher myself, I’ve seen all sorts of stuff I definitely wasn’t supposed to see. It’s more common than you think. A face full of cum? It hasn’t happened yet but I’ve seen other stuff. Nudes, internet search histories, etc. I have a good relationship with my students and they show me things on their phones and get pretty careless. Or they ask me to find a website on their phones and when I type in a letter XXX GLORYHOLE YOUNG THIRSTY SLUT comes up. 
It happens. If your teacher has a healthy relationship with sex, it shouldn’t even be a big thing to him other than a good funny story. If he’s a prude it might be weird. 

My honest opinion and best advice: send him 3-5 emails in a row with the subject in caps that says something like “IMPORTANT: OPEN FIRST” and then in the email tell him you accidentally emailed him an inappropriate picture on blah blah date and time and ask him not to open it. It’s likely that he’ll see warning emails first. 

After that, there’s not much you can do but own up to the fact that you’re satisfying someone’s dick and embrace it. 

Edit: grammar "
He's referring to himself as a jerk friend. Maybe that's his way of apologizing and admitting he took advantage of you.
"Fucking. Gold. You’ve just become his best departmental meeting, and awkward example for the contact info part of the syllabus story for the rest of his tenure. Nothing left to do but apologize and know that this person, who will see thousands of people, will never, EVER forget your name... or face."
"He was a medicine student so obviously he had no time for living, that's why he appreciated easy sex we had so much. We didn't even like each other much, but this is what made it so healthy. Just sex, no attachment.

Great time, would do it again."
"Kissed my husband while we were waiting in line to get popcorn at the movies. Innocent and quick, not a full blown make out session. Chick behind us scoffs like she's disgusted and grabs at her daughter uncomfortably. Before we say  anything these two really huge bears cheer for us and one dip kissed the other. A few people looked uncomfortable but the majority cheered for them.

Made two pretty awesome friends that day"
Definitely sounds like he's talking about himself that way but also trying to figure out what it all means for him - he probably doesn't know how to deal with the fact that he liked it. 
Legitimately hungry for dick.
"lol yes, we're married"
"We were great after. Perfect even.

Then again we were head over heels for each other and not just looking for a hookup. "
"I cut out my mom for almost 2 years. She claimed to be supportive but would put tons of limitations on me. You cant tell this person, you cant tell that person, you cant bring your husband to visit, etc, etc. I let it slide for about 6 months because i live 3000 miles away and it didn't really affect me in any meaningful way but that changed when i went to go visit family with my husband. Before i took the flight she basically emailed me a schedule that showed how i was gonna interact with my family. There were ""no husband"" timeslots that she expected me to deal with. I told her to shove it up her ass. I went and visited everyone but her."
"Ew no

EDIT: I see, my bad, wrong answers deserve downvotes, right?

Yes, we're 5 years married and he gave birth to two of my children, Monica and Jessica. :)"
"I did this to my now-boyfriend when we first started hooking up 2 years ago. The sex just felt really good and it slipped out of my mouth, luckily he said it back. I told him i was jk, he said he wasn't, and then I was like ok i wasnt either 💖"
"To be fair no straight boy does this. Meaning I highly doubt he is 100% straight if he liked getting eaten out that much. He may be questioning his sexuality now and this is way of making it seem like it wasn't a big deal and was nothing.

Or maybe he wants to start it up again... "
"He's my husband now. 

1. We dated. 

2. We broke up. 

3. He moved in to get out of parents

4. We were fuck buddies whenever we didn't score elsewhere. 

5. We got back together. "
Oh hey...
"My situation was strange. We lived together about 9 months after college. Our relationship turned casual pretty quickly. It started out by showering with the door open, being more openly naked in front of each other and stuff like that. Nothing abnormal, but beyond the limits of typical roommates too. Then it escalated to the point we would go out on the weekends and get hammered. Never together. But we would both get home and he'd either be in my bed already or crawl in with me once I got in. We would have a drunken fool around session for an hour or so then crash. The next morning we'd wake up, typically start looking at porn together and jerk off without ever really speaking. Then we'd go on about our days separately until the next weekend when it would all happen again. 

  
I would have normally been opposed to it but it literally caused zero issues other than it being occasionally awkward when we were sober. So yeah. I'd do it again but with caution. "
"Found this cute guy and ended up renting an apartment together. Got us both out of homes with our family and into our own place. A simple “you show me yours and I’ll show you mine” quickly escalated into banging each other on the couch. We both lost our virginity to each other that night. It was a complicated situation. I wasn’t out yet, or really accepting of my sexuality. There was some drama. But damn that guy was hot. We continued to have sex all over that apartment. Add a few more years of drama, learning, and accepting.  And we just got married last month :) So it had a happy ending and was worth it. "
"I've posted it a few times before, so I'll give the quick version. 

Dated a woman who cheated three times with two of my friends, ended it a couple months later. I ended up at her house on Thanksgiving and met her tall, built, sexy nerd brother that to be honest I didn't even know I was attracted to at the time. Met him by complete chance again a couple of months after that and very shortly after we became roommates when my lease was up. We had the hots for each other for 6 months but never said anything to each other. I didn't know how to go about bringing up the idea of experimenting with him so I just left it. Then he tells me he's met someone who's really cute and shows me his picture. ***Jealousy intensifies*** They go on a date later on in the week and I was a fucking mess. I drove myself crazy waiting up for him to get back. He finally comes back and he's knocking into stuff and drunk as can be. He tells me that the guy is cute to look at, but it was nowhere near being around me. Then he finally admits he's in love with me. I came clean about how jealous I'd been and how much I loved him too and he slept with me, nonsexually. After that we both got tested before doing anything and then we worked our way into it. He's very sensitive and receptive to me and how I feel while we have sex, so it was just mind numbing. Here we are 9 years later, 3 years married.  😃 "
"Yes. Girls don’t always give good blowjobs, guys almost always do.

It’s because, like most have already said, because a guy knows what a guy wants."
"Guys give better blowjobs cuz we have a dick, so we know the pain that it causes of using teeth"
"Because I've created all of you as the chosen ones.

I can't fucking choose everyone, that wouldn't be as dramatic."
"If he wanted to have sex with you, then you’re good enough for him. "
Obviously you have to sneak into his office and secretly try to delete the email while hilarious hijinks ensue.
"Maintain constant eye contact in his next lecture. Lick your lips and smirk every time he looks at you. Answer any questions he asks the class with super obvious innuendos. Establish dominance, basically"
Sometimes I wonder if I’m asexual. I can honestly go months without it and I’m fine...
"I realized when I read this lol
"

If I knew my asexual boyfriend was letting me bone him for my sake it would be a total boner killer.
"I don’t know if he really took advantage of me. I enjoyed it and we were the same age. What hurts me is that these activities pleased us for different reasons. To me, it was sexy intimacy with someone I cared about, for him, it sounds like it was all about domination and power. I’m not sad that I spent hours upon hours with my mouth in all his naughty spots, it’s that it meant nothing to him."
"My ex and I were making out in his car. We were parked on Broadway in Boston  And this girl taking a smoke break on the stoops of her work says, “you’ve got to be kidding me.” 

I was like we better make it more graphic.

She was offensive but my then bf and I kept making out, and she didn’t leave. She was texting her friends. We out kissed her until she got too cold and went inside. 

💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

In San Francisco, my date (a different guy) and I were just sitting on the bench taking a break from our 6 hour date 🤷🏻‍♀️and so many tourists and especially their kids were pointing and talking about us. This was in San Francisco. I went ahead and laid my head on his shoulder and then on his lap to make it clear that we are queer and here. Hopefully if any of those kids struggle with sexuality later on, it serves as a anecdotal reference. "

"Considering my mother married her high school sweetheart after dating for 7 years, I'm gonna take a guess and say ""Yes, almost certainly."" On the off chance they were swingers, I think I still have the lead. "
"I understand.  The first time I got a full body massage from a friend I trusted, I sobbed.  For the same reasons.  I had a violent father and being touched by a man usually meant anger and bruises.  To be so vulnerable and to touch and be touched with compassion and desire after that, it can be overwhelming.  Good for you."
thats the cutest shit ever omg fuck it i love you guys too😭💕💕
Yes because a lot of girls dont like having a dick in their mouth. But almost all gay men Love it! The more you are into it the better you'll be!
Stfu idiot. We haven't created subreddit traps covered behind names like r/ladyboners for you to reveal the truth
"Other than him refusing to sleep anywhere but in my twin bed with me it was great.  

The relationship had lots of ups and downs but it had more todo with how deep he was in the closet rather than us being roommates.

8/10 would do again.
"
*raises hand*
"I agree with this, him belittling that intimacy is a coping mechanism."
"It's hard to say. When I was in high school, I had a friend similar to yours. I was really attracted to him and whenever we'd come across each other at school in the corridors or outside, he'd always hug me or playfully wrestle me or lift me up and I'd always think ""he has to be gay because why would a straight guy want this kinda contact with me?"" We'd sit next to each other before first period and his form of gay-teasing and playful touching made me feel like he liked me too. But he was straight. Undeniably straight and when he got a girlfriend I was really upset and eventually hung out with other people and got over him.

I don't understand it but straight guys can do some really weird stuff that I'd never even consider doing to a girl. So I don't know what to say about your friend but his actions aren't wildly out of line with the average super friendly straight guy, sorry. But I could be wrong. Good luck."
That looks so difficult and uncomfortable
"Hugged my boyfriend right outside my school, the campus is dead in the middle of downtown, some guy started cussing us out and was saying he'd kill me. Another time I was in the gay village walking with my friend, and we got called fags. It made me reconsider pda"
"Definitely strained. My college roommate and I were like best friends. We were really close but at this point I hadn’t told him I was gay yet. Also note that he had a girlfriend as well. One night we were drinking and I ended up telling him I was gay. He then starts putting the moves on me and we end up going back to my room and having sex. Afterwards he couldn’t even look me in the eye. Eventually I end up moving out and we haven’t spoken in a couple years since then. 

I would never do it again. Too much of a hassle and drama"
Good on you.  Her shame is not yours to bear.

Straight guys may say the same about pictures of women in that position.
Did you end up together?
Yup. I want to have sex with someone that wants to have sex with me. I dont want him to feel obligated to fuck just because.
"Not me but my husband. A picture is worth enough words to never say another one to that person.

"He was drunk, I was high. It was 4 in the morning, went down in my jockstrap (it was mid heatwave) to get something to drink. He popped down while naked (hes a nudist so not unusual and I’m totally ok with it). We chatted for a bit. He told me I had a nice ass as I went upstairs. 

5 minutes later I got a text asking if I want to cuddle. So went into his room, chatted, cuddled, had sex and we both woke up the next morning a little confused but we were both ok with it. Very occasionally we will fool around. We are both single, him not long out of a very long term relationship with an asshole so very against dating anyone, me no interest in dating at this point in my life, so it kind of works. No real awkwardness"
That wasn’t even a. Sexual story and I am aroused. 
Then professors will keep seeing you with cum on your face.  It's one or the other.
The problem is that people keep responding to the posts. Completely ignoring this shit and not engaging is the most effective way to combat this. 
Yeah just how lesbians eat better pussy than men 🤷🏽‍♀️ we know what we like lmao
Be happy who have someone who gets mad when you do stupid shit
"I just found out I have low testosterone myself. I'm almost 31 and have T levels that of a man over 75. It's no wonder I can go years (longest was 5 years) without sex and days to weeks without masturbation. I'm not trying to deny your asexuality at all, but you may want to order a blood test."

"This took place in a time commonly referred to as ""The 90s"".
I was out of my parents' house for the first time at 18 and sharing a house with a married m/f couple I was friends with. They knew I was a 'mo, so no biggie. I knew the woman better than the man, but they were both cool. I was not aware they had an open relationship until she propositioned me to top her husband. She didn't want to be involved, it was just a fantasy he wanted to happen. I was at first hesitant, but she assured me it would be ok. 
I did it. He was an insatiable bottom after that. They divorced a few months later. She and I are not on speaking terms. He still texts me when he's drunk and wants to get pounded."
"I don't think there is a mod here, idk. I just report posts so it gives me the option to block people. Remember: blocking assholes is an act of self-care, you don't need to apologise for it"

"Ding ding ding ding ding! We have a winner here! The other guy sounds like he's deflecting his feelings so he's just trying to sweep it under the rug. But the fact that he's seeming to be nonchalant is maybe a sign that he's uncomfortable with something he doesn't want to deal with himself. Self discovery is a tricky thing, not everyone wants to do it even if they should themselves the facts."
"1.) I'm sorry you had such an awkward experience and such a pouting person at your wedding. That said, it looked like a wonderful event no less and I hope you still managed to have a good time.

2.) Is is bad I chuckled a bit at the fucking *consistency* of her resting bitch face?"
"Some asexuals can and will still have sex for their partners sake! Maybe he'd be willing to do that, definitely since you two were active before. "
"He was my first. I was 19 he was 24, I think. We did it like three times, then I had to stop it because he wanted more from me but I was not even close to ready for anything more than just exploring myself. Ended up putting a damper on the relationship, but we had separate rooms inside an apartment-style dorm so it was ok. We ended in friendly terms."
Arrogance. there is nothing in this world that makes me want to spite someone more than a person who is too into themselves. 
"Emotional detachment. People who are afraid of creating emotional connections and go through their lives with superficial friendships.

I have a small handful of friends, but we know each other really personally. I think social media has really distorted friendship into this veneer of photographical experiences. "
"It can be one of two things. One, hes so comfortable in his sexuality being straight that hes okay with getting touchy-feely or two, hes not completely straight.


Based off what you said, I'd look for the proper time and place to talk to him and ask him and given how the conversation goes, tell him how you feel. Do it when you guys are alone and not in a group setting. Kinda would like an update this is sweet :3"
"That’s awesome! Hearing stories like this make me smile. What an amazing world we live in. 10 years ago almost no one would be as awesome as that, but here we are."
"The best hookup I had was just the two of us cuddling and watching The Office, so yeah "
"I had exactly that with a guy back in high school except our sports were soccer and cross country. 

I legit thought he was gay and my gaydar never let me down until it did with him, so it seemed. About 5 years after high school I see he started dating an older actor. 

Bitch was gay. I regret never making a move on him.

Next time he says how he wants to wrestle, fucken wrestle him. Take some clothes off and seduce him."
Sounds like you have a fun boyfriend tbh.

"A while. We dated for a year-ish. A few months after we broke up, my lease was coming up and we started to become platonic friends. He wanted to move out of his parents cuz it made dating hard.

We lived together for about a year as not a couple. But one night after we both came back home with no one else, we said fuck it and went at it. Then decided to be FwB. 

Eventually I started having hardcore feelings for him, like sappy love letter feelings. Told him how I felt. He never stopped loving me. Tears. Sex. Back together. Married 2-3 years later."
"The first time I went inside my now-husband BB, I exhaled out, ""This feels like home."""

"He was probably scared when he said ""Im not gay man"" because you guys were with friends. this post is a whole mood for me ugh. he's like a rollercoaster, there are times that he's sweet and times that he isnt and acts like the straightest guy i know. He's sweet in direct messages but isnt in group chats. I hope you guys get together!"

"As cute as this could be, a lot of guys don't get enough physical affection in their lives and supplement it by being friends with gay guys. 

This hurts the gay. 

There's a chance he's into you but keep in mind that he said he's not gay and he might just love you as a friend. I currently have straight friends who only open up and show physical affection like hugs to me or their gfs so there's that. 

You'll probably hurt yourself but that's just growing up isn't it. "
"Im a professor.

Just send an e-mail with the correct file and pretend it never happened.

Upvoting the above comment bc I think this the correct answer
"If you have to open relationship to save it, then it isn't worth it."
Its really easy to be the hottest gay in town.
Don’t be ridiculous. No one is having consistent sex with people out of pity. If he’s having sex with you he’s into you. End of story. 
"hey family, this is my daddy now "
"I'm a parent of a gay man and I've cut off communication with my father, my son's grandfather, until he accepts my son again as a member of his family. You disown my son then you've disowned me, by default. What kind of mother would I be otherwise? "

"When I was 20, I started seeing an adorable guy that I was really into. The first time I finally got to spend the night he kept pulling away from me when I tried to have some sort of contact. Apparently it was uncomfortable for him since he’s quite the furnace in bed. I didn’t realize until that night just how important that kind of intimacy was for me. I ended things with him shortly after. After that, all new potential guys had to pass the cuddle test to be deemed worthwhile since it became a deal-breaker for me. 

Fast forward to 15 years later and my husband and I are always cuddling. Curled up the couch, spooning in bed, holding hands in the car. If we are together, we usually maintain some sort of physical contact. 

I’ve been dealing with some health issues as of late and my libido has been non-existent as a result of the pain I’m in; my husband tells me it’s ok and that all he needs is cuddles anyway. Prior to that, my favorite thing of all time, though, was having sex and cuddling after till we both fall asleep."
I’d do that and transfer schools lmao 
"Awwwwwwwwww
Cmon more details please.

"Cutting out my father was one of my wisest decisions I’ve made. He stole my savings bonds that I was going to use for college. His reasoning was “well, my name was on the bonds too”. He borrowed $5,000 from me when I was in college and never saw that again. Fine whatever, money is lame anyway. The final straw was when I found out he joined some dumbass religious cult called the Crusaders of Christ or some shit. Looked up their fb and they had all this homophobic bullshit on there during pride. I was like “cool, time to block you from all means of communication” it’s easy kuz I also live 1,000 miles away from that shitstain"

"I have completely cut my father out of my life the moment I turned 18 and moved off. My father was a very easily angered and violent person, he had hit both me and my mother multiple times, he had also pushed my mother down a staircase while she was pregnant with me. The problem was mostly his mother ( my grandma). She was living with us and she hated my mother, she was always trying to make them fight, and she was successful most of the time. The final straw, was probably the last time we fought, was a few days before I decided to move out, I don’t even remember the reason he got angry that time, but I remember being locked in my room shaking and crying while he was outside using a hammer trying to break the door so he can hit me, he did. For the record, since I moved out my mother told me that he has become depressed and no longer hits them ( my sibling and mother) on the contrary they keep throwing him out, and I would say bullying him. The only positive thing I can think about him is that he was unexpectedly supportive when I came out.

My dad will jump off a cliff for Trump, is a doomsday prepper, and only watches the stock market or FOX news. He doesn't believe 2 men can love each other in the way 2 straights can...Dont bother arguing with him, youd have better luck trying to argue with a brick wall, hes just that stubborn and opinionated.

"Bi dude also, used to think dudes were just better at head, until I met my current gf. She's also like you said legit starving for dick, like I'm doing her a favor letting her, and she gives the best head I've ever had. I think it's less of a gender thing more of a wanting to VS feeling obligated to "

We didn’t sleep together. One day he asked me to jerk off with him and maybe switch hands with him(he’s gay too). Ended up giving him head and it killed the mood. I guess I misread what he wanted and jumped the gun lol. It didn’t make things awkward though! Just kept on living like normal.

My dear father tried to convinve my mother and the best friend of my mother that I'm not only gay but also a prostitute who is to lazy to work for his living, so I have turned to ""selling my body"". Of course neither my mom nor her best friend believed him. Oh, he also outed me in front of her friend. The reason of him doing shit like that is because my family has severed ties with him ever since we fount out he was having an affair with two different women, one of whim he sticked with and is only 27 (he's 50). This man has stolen 66000 Euros from my big sister and her husband and has shown no interest in returning their money, he refuses to pay the rent he legally has to pay (because he lives with this new gf now but his name is on the contract of this appartment), he has stolen money that legally belongs to my little sister and me. Money I use for paying my rent because I am a full time student at uni. Neither my mom nor I  could afford to pay our rent now and uni si starting in less than a week here in Austria.

"Sexuality is not tied enjoyment of your asshole.  Straight men like to get eaten out like anyone else.  They can also enjoy prostate stimulation.  Women can and do put on strap on's and fuck straight men.  None of this stuff defines sexuality.  If gay meant ""likes butt stuff"", we'd call it analsexual, and there would be a whole bunch of female analsexuals and straight analsexuals.

I'd don't know what this stuff meant to his best friend, but, uh, I was jerking off and into a large variety organic and inorganic things at that age.  I didn't have a sexual connection to the blanket I jerked off into in the basement, it was just the first thing that worked.  Your dick doesn't have a sexuality, only your head does.

In college I actually shared a room with my best friend who is bi. We were close and we were cuddling on my bed and it just kind of happened. We did it a few more times before he stopped it. I’m glad he did because I was catching feelings super hard and it fucked me up for a little bit afterwards. He’s still a good friend now and we kind of laugh about. I’m glad nothing further developed between us because he would’ve been a terrible partner for me. So it was worth in that I learned not to always listen to my dick.

If it keeps eating away at you, I still think pushing the envelope would be best. I hope no matter what you guys remain as best friends, but it will give you a better idea of where things stand. He seems very comfortable around you. If you come out, perhaps that will give him the courage to do the same. Or he will say hes straight and you can move on.

"No offense, but having a train, to me, makes any distance a non issue. In america, in most places, 250 miles is a long ass drive, with tons of gas usage. Driving is more expensive, more dangerous, and way more boring. Being able to just sit and get there with no effort is a huge boon."
"A little backstory: My parents split up when I was 3 (born '99). They had 2 other kids before they split up (I was the middle child) but from what I hear they split up mutually. After they split up my mom tried her hardest to keep my dad out of our lives. We moved around a lot so it would make it harder for my dad to find us. She went as far as giving my dad an ultimatum: Revoke his rights to my younger sister (around 2 or 3) to the guy she was seeing (who would later be my step dad) and he can see his 2 other kids more (me and my older sister). He was tired of trying to fight with her so he complied but she didnt. We still moved across our state several more times. All while she put in our heads that my dad didnt like us and that's why he gave up my younger sister. ( I should also note that my mom didnt want my younger sister knowing my dad was her bio father so she made sure she was in the dark about this all by threatening me and my older sister alot.)

She still kept us away up until child support got involved and they forced her to allow him to start seeing us (me and my older sister bc he gave up my little one). By this time we had already settled down in the suburbs of our home town for a about 3 years (Around 2012). My dad finally got to see us more and that's when some of the truth started to surface about my mom. In the back of my mind I never believed anything he said bc my mom painted a bad picture of him for us. Eventually I started to warm up to my dad alot bc hes genuinely a nice guy and I think my mom started to notice this. 

2 years later (2014) she decided on a whim with no forewarning that were moving across the country. This move really messed me up bc it was so sudden. (literally the day I graduated 8th grade we got on a plane and moved). After the move we were pretty much homeless and couldn't afford to rent so we stayed with my step dads parents for a few months till my mom could find a job and move us out. (By this time there is 7 of us in my family total). I fell into serious depression after and my mom didnt help at all and my step dad just called me a pussy or a fag 95% of the time so it didnt make it any better. 

I eventually started to shake my depression up a little by being active in school and such. (I was a theater kid. I know how typical for a queer kid to be in theater) I made alot of friends and I genuinely though this was the last time we would move. I was VP of our schools drama club I was pretty popular, its every high schoolers dream really. I would go out, party, make friends etc. Typical high school things. I was pretty happy where I was at. 

Then in the middle of my senior year of high school (2016) my mom and step dad decided they're getting divorced. That same night my mom told me and my 4 other siblings to pack our things that we where going back to our home town the next day. I went to school the next day and pretty much had to say my goodbyes to everyone I ever knew in high school. I was so heart broken, so sad, so mad. It was tough to say goodbye to my entire theater class but I had to do it. That day my mom checked me out of school and we drove across the country back to my home town (we couldn't afford a plain ticket for 6 people). 

When we finally arrived at my grand parents house I told my sister that I didnt want to go inside, that I didnt want to talk to my mom. I told her to take me to my dads house and she did. When I arrived I knew that this was the moment that I was cutting ties with my mom for good. 

Its been 2 years since ive moved in with my dad and I can honestly say I'm so much happier with out my mom in my life. 

TLDR; My mom was manipulative and kept moving us across the country to get away from my dad, our last move was the final straw and I cut her out of my life and moved in with my dad.

My tl:dr of it, gays put up emotional walls when in the closet and don't tear them down when they come out. Sex is supposed to compliment emotional intimacy, not replace it. "
Probably because they are socially conditioned to do so. If they could actually only do it when they really wanted to. So not see it as some kind of duty. Than they'd probably do it much better.

I’m always in disbelief when I hook up or hang out with hook ups who appear to have no imperfections in our eyes, but they’re into  you and you’re obviously bringing something to the table they like! And vice versa. It makes me feel better about myself because where we find flaws in ourselves someone else finds treasure and isn’t paying attention to what we believe are our flaws. You have to learn to embrace it! I’m not saying I don’t get what you’re saying, I do, but you have to stop focusing so much on appearance and focus on what’s making you happy! Of course I know it’s easier said then done, but he sounded into you and you sounded into him, but you are just focusing so much on looks... where he probably isn’t at all! But hey maybe it’s a preference, you just aren’t into fit guys? But it definitely sounds like you’re dwelling over looks, I mean do you like your hot fwb for who he is? Sorry If I talked to much. "

Although I’m sorry you are hurt, and I can empathize with your feelings :( I hope you feel better soon and don’t dwell on this too much "

I'm vers. I do like the power play stuff but it's just that - play. My boyfriend and I switch up the power dynamics sometimes and sometimes we just have intimate mutual equal playing-field sex. I think any one kind of sex gets boring after a while. Half the fun of sex is novelty.
"I slept with my current roommate who also happens to be my co-worker and best friend (she's a girl, I was a little curious at the time, if that changes anything). Not only did it reconfirm that I'm 100% into guys, I think it brought us closer in a way. No awkwardness what-so-ever. We woke up in the morning to get breakfast and made jokes all morning. Even now we make inside jokes about it frequently."
"Assuming you're genuinely curious...

As a bi woman, speaking only for myself, I'll blow someone as a mutual exchange of oral sex and really only if it's a dick I'm comfortable with (maybe its human and I have seen each other a few times, so it's a peen I'm fairly familiar with). Unlike a vulva, a dick often involves gagging and the general discomfort that accompanies sticking something girthy in a main breathing hole. I will never know what receiving a blow job feels like, so I can't gage for myself whether the pleasure is truly worth the (temporary!) discomfort. Also, as someone who has experienced nonconsensual dick-suckage, it took a while for me to get to a place where I was okay with consensual dick-suckage

Ma ain't have Grindr or Tinder in her day so definitely
"I’m an Uber driver and it’s happened twice in the little over a year I’ve been driving. First time was with a guy I’d previously hooked up with on Grindr months before. We recognized each other and he asked if I was still on Grindr, said I was, found a spot to park and sucked him off. Got caught by a parking officer, who simply told us we couldn’t park there after a certain time (it was around 1am) and recommended a better place to park, so we moved and I finished him off. Gave me a $5 tip lmao 

Second time was about a month ago.. dude was about a 15 minute trip. He was quiet most of the trip until he randomly asked me where I was from. Then he asked if I was gay or straight and I said “Gay. Why..?” - “Just asking... what time are you off?” I told him I was probably gonna head home after I dropped him off. He didn’t say much else but I could tell he wanted to say something. I dropped him off and drove away, but not even a block later I busted a U-turn and when I found him, asked him “hey man, do you want your dick sucked?” He hesitated a bit but agreed, hopped back in my car, found a hidden place to park, and sucked him off. He wanted to fuck me, but I wasn’t down because I wasn’t prepared and didn’t have any condoms. After he finished, he asked if I could drive him back home so I did! "
"There’s this guy at the gym that looks like a frat boy and he wears these tight ass shorts that give his ass the best damn look!!! His ass makes me wanna top so hard, I would cum so fast if I had the chance, can’t stop looking when he does squats he’s so dame cute!! "

"Every weekend,  my boyfriend and I go to our local bakery for bagels. Thats a little tradition that we really look forward to. We also have this ""competition"" always running about who opens the door for who more. So we always pick up our speed when approaching a door, sometimes even curse at eachother for getting there first. Even for automatic doors,  we'll walk up together,  he will step ahead ever so slightly as we walk in so ""he opens the door, "" then stop and let me pass through. 

For a specific time....I'd say our 6 month anniversary. He got me a single rose. I have never recieved flowers before,  and dammit....I get it. It was the sweetest thing ever. He's a romantic, and I as absolutely love that.  Humble brag.... but I've got a keeper. "

Gotta find the right kind of frame. I had to have a friend come to the store and tell me what kind of frame to get since I didn't think it would help. Completely changed my look. 
"I am a junior in college. I have been living with my seemingly straight guy friend since august 2017. At first we were distant friends. I was openly gay to everyone in the house, and he was openly straight (however people had suspicions about his sexuality since I first heard of the guy). The entirety of fall semester and January of spring, we were nothing but buds. Truly, I felt only platonic towards this guy. But as spring semester continued on, my whole house would watch movies together, and he would put his head on my shoulder. He would wrap his arm around mine. Gradually we were getting more intimate to the point that we had to stop doing it in front of everyone. One night we started kissing, then grabbing, etc. etc. We hooked up up until this summer, when we both decided that we should just date. We are almost at 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW

&amp;#x200B;

The pros: great time and frisky in the beginning. Plus now i have my first ever boyfriend, and also i didnt mention this but he took all my virginities. EVERY SINGLE ONE. even kissing. so that was cool.

&amp;#x200B;

The cons: now we have moved in with each other for senior year as well. He kind of caused my sexual awakening BC he took all my virginities, and I now feel this natural urge to explore. But I live with him now. So if we break up that's awful. But I feel this need.

&amp;#x200B;

so wrapping it all up: was fun, now stressing me out, and kind of making me feel trapped."
"Yes, my mom made me pee sitting down while growing up.

Yes, I’m a bottom.

So, in conclusion, my mom made me a bottom.  Thanks mom."
"Bottom here.  Really don't care.  I have never encountered someone with too small of a dick.

Have definitely encountered men with very large dicks who don't want to take it slow and that is a no go for me."

"Lack of empathy / compassion. I was dating this one guy who was super sweet to me but an absolute ass toward service staff, like a waiter for example. I found it so off-putting that we broke up."
"Yes I'm totally the traditional 'woman' in my relationship. I make less money, do the domestic stuff, and constantly nag my bf for leaving his shit every fucking place and pissing on the toilet seat. If we had kids I would be the principle carer and they would resent the hell out of me and think their 'Dad' was cool and funny. 'Dad' would constantly undermine my authority infront of them so that the kids would love him, and the resentment between us would simmer away for years until it boiled over into a messy hateful divorce. Thank fuck neither of us has a womb. "
Only time I have said it where it completely backfired was having sex after dating for about 3 months. Clearly he didn't feel the same way as me and we broke up a week later.
"It wasn't my first time and it wasn't even intercourse but I was definitely new to gay sex... I was getting pinned down on my stomach and licked all over the back of my neck.  It was playful,  ticklish, intense, and overwhelming to my senses. Minutes later (felt like 10?) This feeling welled up inside of me and I started crying really hard. 

&gt; For once in my life, I felt so safe and loved. And good.

Exactly this. Very well put... Its too bad that the moment was spoiled. You're not an idiot and you should not feel bad for letting yourself feel all the beauty in that moment.  Crying is always a gift."

"I lived in Paris, France in college. Anyway, my apartment wasn't too far from the Eiffel tower and a guy on grindr said he wants to hook up but loved risky semi-public play and to meet him on the champ-de-mars (park in front of the tower) . Anyway he was hot so I was like, ya dude sure. I meet him in the park and he was a paramedic assigned to the tower for the day because they were hosting some event where people were zip lining from the tower.(Not everyone just certain people)  So, I see him and he throws on a spare paramedic jacket and tells me he wants us to have sex on the tower in a bathroom. He sneaks me through the employee entrance posing as a paramedic intern which I didn't know existed. We took the elevator half way up and walked the rest of the way but on the way a 16 year old girl has a panic attack and faints. Well, I had to pretend to take her vitals (she was from the US so didn't speak french and I do obviously ) while he was telling me to play along while he was making sure in general she was okay. This took like 40 mins btw and I was like what the actual fuck am I doing. Anyway, we eventual get to the top but they wanted him to watch a couple people zip line down so I had to go through another security line.(As a fake paramedic intern)  So while people aren't looking he is constantly grabbing my dick (my crotch area) and whispering how he can't wait for me to fuck him and I'm just trying to figure a way to go home. Another 30 mins passes and we manage to sneak off to some restrooms but it was too packed and as we are giving up he gets a call about a heart attack at the base of the tower so he's like, ""Yea I'll just go to your place when my shift is over "" (since I lived close.) Anyway he showed up at my place like four hours later and we fucked like rabbits(Found out he was married to a woman after) but the whole situation felt hella illegal and odd. xD
