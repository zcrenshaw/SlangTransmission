"I don‚Äôt find him annoying because he‚Äôs overtly flamboyant. I find him annoying because he is generally an annoying and cringe person, all gender expression shit aside."
"Seems like he cheated on his boyfriend and is trying to make himself feel better by accusing you two of rape, which is totally wrong and ridiculous."
"&gt; is it selfish to not want to be the girlfriend he keeps around for appearances?

You‚Äôre a person, not a prop. Doing this to you would be extremely selfish of him. You need to do what‚Äôs best for you."
"No. I want a gay camp crystal lake, or a sci fi movie where the scientist needs to save the world and is motivated by his husband and children at home. **We need more gay characters, not more ‚Äúgay‚Äù movies**

You can‚Äôt tell me a horror movie about a bunch of twinks in a cabin is not gonna be gold."
I‚Äôm glad for that. I do like him a lot. But I still can‚Äôt consider voting for him until his website has a policy section and he starts getting specific about just what his policies are.
"No it‚Äôs not weird, but most people looking for a quick hookup aren‚Äôt trying to grab a beer and get to know someone beforehand."
"bitch stop panicking. he is cool with it, if he wasn't he would have whopped you and your boyfriend's ass on that couch."
Being gay doesn‚Äôt automatically make you a good person
"Whether it was a guy or girl, if the other partner isn't comfortable with their partner being that affectionate with others (especially when they were the ones that initiated it) then it's kinda inexcusable. There's obviously no way for us to know, or assume, his sexuality. But it's clear that there's something happening where he at least wants to kiss random guys and is concerned with others knowing he is. Depending on your age as well, this can be even more telling in regards to where he may be at in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unless I was in a mutually understood open relationship, I don't think I could personally be comfortable enough to continue a relationship with someone who's willing to just kiss a stranger and not even be willing to discuss the situation as a whole, and understand why it made you uncomfortable."
"Because conservatives are not pro life, they're pro birth.   That is all.  If they were actually pro life, they would make sure every morher had access to excellent pre-natal care and nutrition.  Once the child was born, they would be pro universal childcare, pro excellent education, pro universal access to healthcare and good nutrition.  Once born, conservatives wash their hands of that fetus, and they're on their own. The hypocrisy speaks for itself."
"I strongly dislike him for how much of a bitch he is. I remember hearing about how he acted at drag con the year he ""made it"" and could cut lines thinking he had the right to. There's also the transphobia and how he's waaaay too into straight guys to the point it's disgusting (listing his gender as female on dating apps so straight guys hit on him, pressuring them to hangout with him even though they're clearly uncomfortable, then posting about them on his social media). He's just a huge fucking mess."
I'm mostly annoyed that he's rich enough to own two pianos but can't play for shit.
"Wow, that honestly sounds like the best case scenario in your situation. Sounds like your brother has no problem with it. Maybe talk to him about your sexuality, you may as well at this point. I know you probably want to jump off a bridge right now, but trust me when I say how much relief you'll get when you can tell someone close to you (I'm assuming) about yourself. Obviously you don't have to tell anyone, just a suggestion.

Goodluck with it!
Oh and go get dinner with him, it's bad to think on an empty stomach :)"
"I'm quite short (5'2) and I prefer other short guys, but it's not a strong preference. There's a guy who's interested in me who's 6'7, though, and that may be a bit too chihuahua-humping-great dane for me."
"James Charles isn't in hot water for trying to sleep with ""straight"" dudes, he's a shit because he tried to (or did) get people to sleep with him against their own wishes by manipulating or threatening them with his money and fame. 

Homophobes aren't homophobic because of anything gay people do or don't do, they're homophobic because they are bad people."
Yes. I also like to see more of the every day Joe with the average body.
"A Jehovah‚Äôs Witness friend of mine (no judgment here, they don‚Äôt vote and didn‚Äôt vote against my marriage)  told me that as long as I didn‚Äôt have gay sex it was ok if I loved another man (my husband).  I asked him if his marriage to his wife was based on sex.  Of course he replied it wasn‚Äôt.  My reply was, ‚ÄúThen why do you think my 45 year relationship with my husband is all about sex?‚Äù"
"I think lying and trying to placate him is probably the worst thing you can do, because A) he won't believe you B) now he may lose confidence in you too if he feels you're just trying to placate him.   


I think a very gentle and caring manner you can empathize, reassure, and express your feelings.   
e.g. ""I understand you feel insecure about your size. However I do not have an issue with it and everything has been good for me. My only issue is with you unnecessarily beating yourself up about it.""  


Additionally, without getting too personal (too late?) if the sex is just alright i would stress the importance of communication as he may view any dissatisfaction and attribute it to his existing insecurity."
"Plot twist: he has been stalking you on social media for weeks and manipulated you by lying about his birthday coinciding with yours. I anticipate you will be buried under his garage within the next 30 days.

He is probably watching you right now."
"I'm from the Philippines and I heard some horrific stories of some of our ""pretty"" looking male overseas workers who went there and end up being raped not by one but multiple guys. I heard one of them is now mentally ill. Guys who go there to work are advised to grow facial hair to not look that pretty and not attract Arabs."
The professional stuff is way too sterile.
"Whoever those gay guys were, they did it right.

You fight ignorance, misconceptions, lies with exposure, education, and kindness.

Isolation, confrontation, and anger will usually have the opposite effect on people and only serve to confirm their biases and force them to dig in.

Change is gradual, one heart at a time, and takes kindness and patience.

Entitlement and ego are not your friends and will not serve you well if your goal is honest change.

Great post, OP."
"if you search for bears, twinks, college, whatever, you're going to find white guys.

to find Asian guys, you basically *have* to search for that specifically."
"I've had two employees who thought I was a ""hot"" boss - one of them even tried to proposition me after a company Christmas party that we had all been drinking at.... it took some serious effort to say no üòÜ"
"I think there is a LOT more insecurity about how the general public will see your partners appearance in gay couple's than straight. Like we are already worried about people judging us and standing out, add in your partner being not conventionally attractive and than you feel like people think your even more of a pervert. 

Basically I absolutely find myself attracted to bigger guys pretty frequently, but I also know I would be less comfortable introducing them to my parents than if it was a fit guy."
it's not gay if you're on top. ugh uh...
"Duuude one time I met up with a guy at 4 in the fucking morning cause I was so lonely cause my boyfriend had just broken up with me. 

This guy ordered an Uber for me and dropped me off at his place ~ 20 minutes away from my dorm. As soon as I got there, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to do anything and I wanted to go home. I forced myself to have sex with him cause he paid for the uber and I didn‚Äôt have a ride back home. Horrible experience :("
Not weird. Smart.
Yes. It's more genuine.
"Same.  I'm tired of the three tired plots: 1. Gay people coming out and getting beat up for it. 2. Gay people in a sort of relationship but not really because someone is out. Or 3. Gay people dying of aids.

I need a character who is interesting, doing real life things and who, oh btw, has a husband."
A cabin in the woods and a dog.
"There's nothing wrong with responding this way. If he was only willing to be friendly cause he was hoping to date you, he doesn't sound like a very nice guy anyway."
"For sure it doesn't.

That's why I laughed so hard when a poster said that Peter Buttigieg is ""one of us"" - like we all are on the same level of the playing field and all share the same experiences from society just because we're gay! What a joke."
"being anti-fem is dumb as shit and probably a result of internalized homophobia, but i hate james charles and find him annoying because he's a dweeb lmao. plus the whole ""influencer"" thing reeeeally rubs me the wrong way."
"&gt; Some Saudi \[men\] can‚Äôt have sex with women, so they have sex with guys. When the sexes are so strictly segregated‚Äù 

I heard this about India too."
Arrogance kills it for me within moments of the first sign. There is a fine line between confidence and hubris. Some people are just incredibly full of themselves and Jesus it is the most massive turn-off.
I would SERIOUSLY contact a lawyer right away. Also to prevent him slandering you to others he needs to know with the weight of the law that he can't tell people you raped him. This is beyond serious. Take it so.
"I think it's definitely important and caring if you have genuine concern for someone to sit down and have a talk with them. However, how they react and what they do is their choice, and honestly, its not without risk: they could denounce your friendship due to their own self rejection. In the end, though, it's not your place to make anyone else's choices."
They are not trying to get to know someone at all:D
This wouldn't bother me. Spend those nights with the brother's girlfriend. You can drink wine and bitch to each other about how weird your boyfriends' family is.
Plot twist #2: Twin brothers separated at birth.
"Really? I think there's too many movies about a slightly effeminate very attractive young white gay liking a popular closeted masculine very attractive young white gay. I want more gay themed films where romance and sex isn't the main plot, like gay thrillers with psycho ex-boyfriends or two gay best friends comedy type films."
"You're not being unreasonable but most people are looking for quick sex only I guess. I asked the same to a guy and he replied ""if you didn't like me and my body, you could've just told, you're being too careful as if l proposed you or we're getting married, its just a hook up"" and then he blocked me. And i really liked him but whoa.. it just happened in a few seconds and he blocked."
"Unfortunately, many gays reduce homosexuality to sex too"
"It's never the blue-haired gays, it's never the flamboyant gays, it's never the feminist gays, it's never the barely-clothed gays. Homophobes are homophobic because they hate/dislike gay people. That's it. That's the only reason. To blame individual gay men for the oppression gay men AS A WHOLE face reeks of internalized homophobia."
"&gt; How could anybody love me when my parents, my friends, and I can‚Äôt even love me? 

You don't get the parents you want or the parents you deserve. You get the parents you get. Some people are unfortunate enough to have assholes for parents. If that's the case, you both have to suffer the burden of being without them, and are better off without them anyway. (I speak from experience, I haven't spoken with my mother in about 28 years. Yes it still hurts sometimes. It's better than the alternative.) 

If your friends don't love you, *they're not your friends*, you need to get new friends.

If you don't love you, you have a self esteem problem, you need to see a psychologist."
"It might be easier to have gay sex but that still doesn‚Äôt mean freedom or gay liberation. 


I stand with Saudi gays first and foremost, bottoms AND tops. But nobody is really a winner here. The straight men are also suffering, as are the women. Under such a repressive regime, who wins? Sure, we enjoy gay sex, and it‚Äôs an interesting side effect. But given the cost..."
Smoking
"Uh...no.

We don't share the same spoon.

That would be *disgusting.*"
"The therapist is going to be looking for a reason why you're being withdrawn. Give them a good one that they'll understand. Your introversion is a great example. Explain that it's exhausting being around them. You want to contribute, but you're never quick enough in your remarks or witty enough in what you're saying or feel like you wouldn't contribute meaningfully to the conversation like everyone else. 

Your goal is to make yourself sound insecure in light of your family. They're all better at socializing than you (try to say this with a straight face) and it makes you want to give up when you're around them. You don't hate or resent them, but it's difficult for you to keep up with them when they never give you a chance to recharge your battery on your own.

The therapist will hear ""self-esteem issues"" and write you off as a normal teenager going through normal teenager angst and tell your parents it's normal. The therapist might even tell them to give you some space! 

For the record, I'm completely opposed to lying to a therapist, but I would not trust your parents to find a therapist that has your best interest at heart. Having grown up in the South, it's probably some pseudo-religious quack that calls themselves a therapist. Say and do whatever you need to in order to escape and achieve financial independence. That is your only priority."
"No, he didn't report directly to me so it was easy to maintain that level of professionalism. I'll be honest tho - after I resigned from that position I fucked the hell out of him - oddly enough, he identified as straight and even had a girlfriend and two kids.

The other guy was actually someone I had hooked up with thru Grindr prior to one of my managers hiring him - I made it pretty clear to him when he started that there would be  no more hooking up...can't win em all."
"I wouldn't say no more hookups, but of course that's up to you. Just use common sense by verifying. Snapchat is literally a gaybros bestfriend, use it. If he doesn't have, then ask him to dm you from his Instagram account, if he doesn't have that then ask him to send a picture holding a spoon or something. Lastly, I get the appeal when you're horny late in the night, but I don't recommend late night hookups, I never meet someone after 9pm ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"you‚Äôre just conventionally attractive and thus garner more attention

guys are more likely to be more direct and hit on you than most girls would be so that‚Äôs probably why it seems like you attract more of them

you‚Äôre just better looking than your friends lmao"
"On the one hand you're right that is the best way to change people's views. on the other practically speaking it means we're constantly held to a higher standard than other people until we prove our worth as human beings to them. Just as you take the 'good' gays and say therefore gays are okay, then the alternative view is interacting with 'bad' gays means it's acceptable to be homophobic. I don't want to live my life with restraint and second guessing every action because of other people's homophobia, I just want to live a normal life, as did all the martyrs in our community who didn't want to die for our cause they just wanted to live.

Still though this is a nice article and I don't mean to make it negative, this is a positive example of people changing their views and I understand the complexity of the situation."
"Guys who are mean to waiters

I dated this hot guy for a while but he was embarrassingly rude to a waitresses once and I remember thinking ""wow I am never going to see you again""."
"
Hey you have a strong online presence here and I really enjoy your content. You‚Äôre still super young and have all the time in the world to go out there and find friends who care about you and your special day. It‚Äôs going to be work though, it took time, effort, patience, and a little right place right time attitude to find my friend group. 

When you do find those friends that pay special attention to you, cherish them. Thank them for wishing you a happy birthday, thank them for coming to your birthday parties and getting you gifts. The love you give is equal to the love you take. So even though you‚Äôve been dealt some shitty cards in life, don‚Äôt forget the hearts in the deck too.

If anything this random stranger online wants to wish you a happy birthday. 20 is a big year and I hope it bring you peace, growth, and satisfaction üôÇ"
I support it
Lol he probably knows by now
"My boyfriend is 6' and I'm 5'5. I can say that kissing quickly becomes a chore because I feel like an over-ambitious midget giraffe trying to eat leaves off a tall tree in the middle of a savannah.  


So yeah... I might have a thing for short guys!"
"""I‚Äôve always set myself on fire to keep other people warm""

Ain't that the truth for many of us... Well said."
He‚Äôs obnoxious and his voice is annoying too. There‚Äôs a difference between being somewhat effeminate and self expressive/flamboyant and having an entire ridiculous fabricated reactionary persona that is hypersexual and acts as a terrible role model for the gay community while simultaneously making the world think gays act like that normally.
"You are probably the hottest guy in your group and these guys are just very cocky.

Unless you are interested in guys...."
Is this on Grindr? Is so it doesn't matter what you look like. Flakes. Flakes everywhere.
"I've never had much interest in any of that myself, but I've never been uncomfortable around it either. Some people just place a different level of value on some things than I do."
"This guy has some SERIOUS issues. It is definitely an unfortunate situation and one I am sorry you have to go through man! But I would not sweat the rape accusation, they would be incredibly unlikely to prosecute(I am only a paralegal at a mid size firm so I am no authority but I have relatively strong knowledge in regards to this sort of thing)  and he is most likely just trying to threaten you with it so it never gets brought up and his partner never hears about it. 

I would do nothing. Most importantly don't tell his partner or any mutual friends about it in the near future because that is probably the only thing that would set him off enough to go on the defense and perjure himself about it. I would count it as a blessing that you found out he is a little bit unhinged and just separate yourselves from that entirely. People make their own choices it shows a pretty dramatic lack of character and integrity for him to try and pin something like this on somebody else."
I'm so sorry for your loss
Because believe it or not... their view of heterosexuality is JUST as sexualized.  So when they think about homosexuality... they are doing so through a sexualized lens... but from a heterosexual perspective.
"I‚Äôm not sure I can vote for someone who, in the middle of a measles epidemic, says ‚ÄúI support vaccine waivers‚Äù. It‚Äôs tone deaf. It shows a lack of understanding for public health, which is the area that needs so much help for LGBTQ suicides. And frankly, it makes him look very unintelligent to not understand that."
Tammy should've left him in nature after their walk.
"Gah this is what I've been getting! Like bro I'm into you but I don't wanna fuck someone I can't have a beer with, chemistry and safety are important (to me at least)!"
You'll be laughing about it with your husband 20 years from now.
"I'm glad someone commented on this specifically.

Absolutely not selfish, at all.  If that's what's happening, he's using OP."
45 years?! Congratulations man!
"You can be fem and not annoying, James Charles is both fem and annoying."
YASSSSSSS This comment is where it is AT!
"So, you got caught. It was going to be revealed sooner or later. And trust me, he probably already knew you were gay. 

 ‚Äúyou can bring your friend if you want, too‚Äù. 

That was his way of telling you he's okay with it and that he still loves you. 

Go to dinner and don't talk about it."
An article talking about how masc straight tops want to fuck pretty gay boys appears on                r/gaybros? Shocking.
My dad used to tell me that gays caused the fall of the Roman empire and that the same thing would happen to America if we aren't careful.
"Lmao exactly it‚Äôs actually kind of cute the whole charger gag too knowing damn well his charger wasn‚Äôt in there 

Yeah stop panicking lmao at least ur having fun I wasn‚Äôt that confident at 16"
"please..just don‚Äôt change, you seem like really nice and open-minded guy"
College is better the high school for meeting people. I meet my fiance in college and never dated anyone in high school.
"I thought this was normal, haha.

The only thing to do is have restraint.  Every now and then you'll meet someone new and become enamored with them; they have a lot of good qualities and being attracted to that is typical.  

Part of commitment is the mutual agreement than when you meet those people in your life, you don't let it negatively affect your relationship.  Which it sounds like you did; you never let it get physical and you dialed it back.  

This doesn't mean your love your husband any less.  It's possible to think the world of your husband and still ""fall in love"" with others.  

That said, IF you feel there is something missing between the you and your husband that's a conversation to have with the guy."
"Yeah seems like he initiated and pushing for further actions. I agree, he cheated and is trying to use you two as a scapegoat to make himself feel better."
"This is serious. 

The guy is unstable, is freaking out he cheated on his boyfriend and didn‚Äôt have permission to play with others.

He is trying to change the narrative now. 

My suggestion:

1) Right now, you should each, in your own words and independently, write down all details of the night. The dinner. The conversations. The trip home. Everything that happened at the house. In your bedroom. The next day. How long he stayed.  Also detail and copy everything he said in text and your replies. 

2) Obtain all the Ring video footage of him entering and leaving your home. Hopefully it is time and date stamped. 

3) Seek legal counsel. 

I say this because he is already showing signs of defamation. Spreading lies about you and your partner. 

A) lawyer may suggest filing your own police report?

B) lawyer may suggest sending him a letter stating you will sue him for defamation if he spread this lie to anyone. He is to cease and desist speaking of this to anyone in terms of a rape accusation. 

C) Lawyer may suggest you bring friend into his office and discuss the matter in a formal and documented way. 

To me this is about saving your good names, your livelihoods, etc. Whatever happens to this friend‚Äôs relationship is his problem. But a gag order may need to be sent to his boyfriend as well. 

D) You May want to track down your waiter from dinner and get him to write an overall statement about what he/she heard and witnessed at your dinner. Overall demeanor of each of you.  Maybe do the same for the taxi/Uber driver home. 

Hopefully you can get some good advice!

4) Moving forward, maybe you should take a short video of anyone going to join you in the bedroom. Asking if they want to go up and have sex with you two? At least you‚Äôd have some tangible thing to revert back to if you got another accusation. 

This is not over. It will have ripples. People will ask why all of you are not hanging out on both sides? Things are going to get out and it will paint you and partner in a bad light. Deal with this shit today!"
"Oh god yes, 6'4"" and built like a brickhouse, not only hot but smart as hell too! But I take fraternization pretty seriously and so does he, so I've resigned myself to just eye fucking him from a distance. üôÉ"
"There's a supervisor for another department who's really easy on the eyes. Japanese-American guy, 5'9"" with cherry blossom sleeve tattoos and built like a tank. He and his wife (who's a sup in one of our other buildings) actually interviewed me for my last promotion interview. Really nice couple, but too bad she doesn't know he's actually married to me.

Too bad he doesn't know that either LOL"
"My first comment is, ""Sex is alright.""? What does that mean? I'm hoping it means super-awesome. It's only been six months, you should still be feeling each other out - so to speak. 

Otherwise - 

Dicks are dicks. Some are smaller than others, some are bigger than others. It has nothing to do with pleasing a partner. My advice? Confront it head on. 

""Yeah, your a little smaller than average, Who cares. But ya know what? Guess what I get to do?  I get to take all of you in in my ass like a porn star without screaming and writhing in pain while pretending to love it - which really is a good thing.""(the prostate is only about 2-3 inches inside - which I'm assuming he can hit)."" I can get your whole dick in my mouth without feeling like I'm going to die of suffocation or dislocating my jaw. I get to focus on getting you off without worrying about keeping me out of pain. I love that.  I love sucking you off and getting fucked by you, it's fun. Huge dicks are too much work. And if I ever want to have that ""huge dick"" experience, we'll work around it. We'll buy a big dildo and you'll fuck me with that - or vice-versa. You are more than your dick.""

Of course, this is only advice if it's sincerely not an issue. If it is, that's a whole other thread. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see - I love smaller than average dicks. LOL."
"idiocy. i mean just plain dumb as fuck, with no interests or personality."
"Honestly as a black guy, I feel you. I prefer honestly to be with nonwhite guys, simply because my race almost never comes up. With 50% of white guys...it's like ''oh, I love men of color. I love black men! You all have the biggest cocks"". After a while, it's...annoying.

Not to say liking someone's race isn't something that should happen. I tend to have a preference for Arab, Irish, Samoan and Brazilian dudes but I don't see them as this walking stereotype. I just love their features I guess."
Tati really did end him.
"This post is not glorifying HIV at all. What it‚Äôs doing is letting those who are positive know that this terrible thing that happened doesn‚Äôt have to make your quality of life worse. It‚Äôs all about the attitude. It‚Äôs like half the people on this sub want HIV+ people to be miserable, sick, and literally on their death beds so they can keep justifying their prejudice. Nobody (except a few crazy people) wants this disease, but some end up getting it, and your life doesn‚Äôt have to end there."
"&gt;I'll be honest tho - after I resigned from that position I fucked the hell out of him - oddly enough, he identified as straight and even had a girlfriend and two kids.

"Unfortunately this is extremely common, and I have been in your shoes before. One of the podcasts I listen to recommends to ‚Äúfuck politeness‚Äú aka in these types of situations we often feel obligated or compelled to ‚Äúbe nice‚Äù but in reality you have no obligation to do anything for any stranger. It is in fact okay to say no. You and your person should be you‚Äôre number one priority. Stay safe out there y‚Äôall! &lt;3"
"Lying to him also reinforces any potential beliefs he might have that other people are just lying to be nice. Someone with low self-esteem probably has some ""they're only being nice because they have to"" thoughts, which you'd be proving him right if you lied to him.

Personally, I'd make a no apology about his dick size rule, and just make sure you show affection towards him in the bedroom. Doing that consistently over time will help him a lot I bet."
wow! thats $215 more than i charge

"I am a straight passing somewhat broey gay dude, and pretty much exclusively date the same.  I can handle a lot of vices from people, but the one thing I will not put up with are guys who look down upon ""gay"" venues or ""gay"" things.

We all like dick.  You don't need to enjoy the circuit scene or club scene (lord knows I don't) but don't shit talk people who do or people who like to live in gayborhoods.  Will turn a 10/10 into an insignificant dating partner in my eyes."

Once a guy or gal is out, after hiding it for so long, sometimes he/she can get carried away with the novelty of it.

That‚Äôs my take."

"Ultimately, you have to do what is best for you. If that means letting him go - then so be it. That does not make you a bad person in the slightest. You know where you are in life - you know what you want. And he doesn't seem to be on the same page.

My advice?
Talk to him.

Tell him how you feel, ask him how he feels. Where does he see this relationship going, etc.
Understand where he is coming from and assure him that he is free to talk with you without judgement. Relationships need boundaries and he crossed one. Going up to random people and asking them to kiss while being in a relationship without your partner's consent is not okay. If he wants to be in an open relationship and mess around with guys, or even other women, is a conversation you both need to have.

If that is not something you are not interested in, that is okay. You have the right to want and have the relationship you need to feel fulfilled. And so does he. 

But you need to talk to see where he is at in his life. What he wants, etc. And be open telling him the same.

I wish you the best of luck."
"In high school I had this incredibly hot boss. So hot that I was nervous just talking to him. (He was one of three of my bosses, this was in a restaurant kitchen). On a smoke break once he told me I didn‚Äôt have to be scared of him because he was a nice boss; he confused my crush for fear ha. That made me like him even more. Ahh"

"So true. One of us. Whatever. I went to a Pride parade once and didn't feel like anyone. The ads were full of hot white men, the floats were all hot white men ( with a few black dudes ). Being gay is pretty much being hot white and fit. If you don't fit into that mould you're not one of us !"

"Throwaway account because my coworkers know my other username.

Not directly my boss but VP of sales. Built like a brick house, nice scruff, does a lot of ""bro"" stuff (like patting me on the back really hard by surprise at the water cooler, and many other jock-like fooling around going on), smells amazing... you get the gist. Ex-military. Has wife and two kids.

Went out on a run with him after work, and I've never smelt a sweaty man as good as him before. Couldn't stop eyeing the little sweat stains under his tight fitting shirt (sorry bros got a pit fetish here), the fine chest hair peeking from the top of his shirt, and his nipples showing through his sweaty hoodie. And to make things worse we went back to the office to change, and the moment he got into the office (it was empty with only two of us left) he just took his hoodie and shirt off altogether. He propped himself up against the window and caught me staring, and said... what do you want with a wink.

He knows I'm gay. What a cocktease.

Of course I couldn't bang him, we still work together T\_\_\_\_T"

"&gt; and when gay men have been fighting to let go of this stigma of them being predators 

Yoo this struck real hard because it's so real. A lot of good gays out there being ruled as predators just because some bad eggs decided to do it. I've had straight friends apologize to me because they ""used to be homophobic,"" and I asked why, and they told me they've had predatory gays go after them in the past."
"I met a guy a few months ago and we hit it off right away. He's a professor, smoking hot, very thoughtful, sweet guy. Kinky, seemingly in a lot of ways that would be a good fit for me.

We went out a few times and had a nice time. Grabbed drinks after work one day and he convinced me to come meet up later that night at a dance party. Not usually my thing, but sure.

We showed up and this dude was absolutely out of his fucking mind plastered and all over everyone. Completely different person. Had zero regard for other people's personal space or whether they wanted him up in it. 

All that attraction evaporated pretty much instantaneously. 

Oh, and he wound up getting arrested that night for groping someone."

"Sounds like you were being honest.  NTA.

But if they're separated then he's not married and therefore that's taken care of, and if you're not ready for a relationship that's also fine but it shouldn't preclude friendship.  Your shut down is easily countered, unless he's specifically looking for someone to date because you're not that.  And you're eager for friend/companionship.

You can be all things and no things all within a moment."
"Enhanced emotional intelligence and empathy in a lot of cases.  Some not so. 

Having a double wardrobe if you happen to marry a dude who is roughly the same size as you like I did. 

Sometimes being the person that everyone relies on to be the glue holding the family together because of your ability to see both sides of the coin. 

Having to come out over and over and over again untill you suddenly realise you don't need to any more and you just are yourself without thinking twice about it.  

Resilience."
"I'm sorry this is happening to you.  Unfortunately, this seems to a common experience among gay men of color.

"I‚Äôm glad to see this was brought up.  The common theme in ‚Äúheartwarming stories‚Äù about change like this is often that the people in the out-group have to do something extra and go out of their way in order to have the in-group ‚Äúlike‚Äù them.  So this perpetuates the idea that **if you‚Äôre in the out-group, it‚Äôs not enough to just live your life normally, you have to go out of your way to placate members of the in-group**.  A more telling piece of information would be this woman‚Äôs stance on gays if they hadn‚Äôt done all kinds of special favors for her.

And yet, this is the world we all live in and so I realize there is real importance in making these kinds of connections and changing minds.  As the parent-commenter noted, it‚Äôs a situation with complexity and this is overall a nice article."

The takeaway for me is that you are treated equally. You and the brother‚Äôs girlfriend are treated the same.
"I think it's because the sex is the only thing that's reliably different between straight and gay people. It's only natural that it becomes a point of interest.

"This is exactly what people not using current pictures are counting on. They're counting on someone being too polite/non-confrontational to reject them to their face.

I did it once. Just a BJ, but after that I thought about it and realized that the other guy was a total jackass for doing what he did. It's not shallow to be upset when someone is intentionally using pictures that misrepresent themselves.

Happened another time. I told the guy that he's at least 100 pounds heavier than his pic, and that wouldn't matter as much except that he lied. He told me I never would have come if I saw a pic of him the way he was, and I was like ""well you'll never know now"". And left. Jokes on him I like bigger guys as long as they match it with confidence, personality, and honesty."

Kissing another person like that. In that context seems very douchey. No one deserves that. He sounds like he's got some figuring out to do. I say go for a guy that's not confused and won't kiss other people

"How old do you think they look? They seem plausibly 18 to me.

And I think pedophilia has more to do with an attraction to prepubescent people, rather than attraction to those who look like they could be minors.

"I was once in your exact situation

I found this super hot daddy who I fooled around with and we ended up being friends. He insisted on paying for everything. At first it was lunch, then he surprised me with a new coat and wanted to take me shopping. I'd have to make up a story of how I got a $1,000 scarf to my friends. 

But my guy was NOT a sugar daddy because I wasnt having sex with him for the things he bought me. He just did that as a way of showing affection. This is a very important distinction.

If I ever called him a sugar daddy he would be incredibly offended. I did have an explicit conversation with him explaining that he didnt have to buy me things and that I couldn't reciprocate financially at all. If your bond with this guy grows you should consider doing the same. 

Once everything was out in the open with my guy I ended up going on trips with him and everything. He ended up being one of the richest men in my country.  Insane wealth. It was easily the most glamorous time of my life."

"I think he hasn‚Äôt rolled policy out because he had no name recognition before February or March.

If he started like Warren he‚Äôd be dead on arrival with a hard to pronounce name *and* ‚Äúboring‚Äù policy talk. It‚Äôs taken Warren this long to find some momentum and she‚Äôs incredibly high in name rec. I think he‚Äôll start rolling out policies around debate time and during to capitalize off of the enormous national platform, rather than do it on puff piece interview shows like Ellen. Those are good for expressing where your heart is and vision. Obama did this same thing but it wasn‚Äôt as visible as now due to the smaller interconnectivity  of everything in ‚Äò07-‚Äò08.

I come from a working-class background, engaged to a middle-class man who has some very upper-class friends and relatives. I joke that the reason I'm so uncomfortable at some of his family gatherings is that I feel like I should be serving canapes. 

Thing is, it's just something I'm trying to get over. It's not their fault they have money and of course different classes are going to have different cultures. That's all it is. So Money will never be my natural habitat, but it's OK to take a holiday there sometimes."
"I'm a top and I take long. Some guys just take a while. It's not your fault, it just sucks. In fact, we can tell when you get tired/impatient and it makes it worse for us because we feel like we're under pressure to not disappoint you.  I've always had a low sex drive relative to other guys. My ideal is to have sex every 3-4 days for best results. If I've cummed any time before that, it can take me some time to finish. It's great if a bottom is into long sessions, but not if he gets tired quickly. Bj's, you can forget it. I have to have not cummed at all within the past week to cum in any fast timeframe from just bj's."

Just because cruising is easy and maybe Herero male on male relations can be sought does not mean life for gay men is easy."
"I completely understand where you're coming from. Its just something that has kind of evolved out of hookup culture. Guys expect to turn up at your place, get down to business, and be gone fairly soon after. Going for a drink first makes them think you're looking for more than a hookup, that you're after a relationship. And thats not what most folk on Grindr and the like are looking for. 

Unfortunately there's no real advice I can give you on how to fix this. Some guys would be up for getting a drink with you first, I'm sure. You'll just have to get used to most guys reacting like you described."

Democratic socialism is the path forward to correcting the material conditions that lead young gay and trans people into ruin and suicide. They need things. They don't need to see a gay president. They need a president who will provide healthcare, counseling, and a living wage. If you want to support lgbt people you should support the legislation that protects them from discrimination and provides a social safety net for them. That means not Buttigieg, not Beto, certainly not fucking Biden. Bernie or Warren are the only options for a president that truly supports lgbt people."

I absolutely have no respect towards people who agree with these principles because as a gay man, I see religion creating violence against me all the time. So I‚Äôm not going to tolerate Muslim people, Catholics or anyone of this kind who supports this kind of behaviour and thinking.

If somebody looks at James Charles‚Äôs behavior and paints the same brush on all gay men, they thought negatively of the gay community to begin with."
"&gt; My dad used to tell me that gays caused the fall of the Roman empire and that the same thing would happen to America if we aren't careful.

Both Trajan and Hadrian led the Roman Empire to greatness, even though they preferred men. 

Homosexuality had nothing to do with the collapse of the Roman Empire lmao"
"Close the app. Now that you know he's gay, flirt with him the next time you see him. Do not stalk his profile or memorize what he's into. Let it happen naturally."
Yup in 5'9 and I dated a guy who was 6'4 and I really didn't enjoy it.
"I followed something like 80 fetish blogs, and probably 60 up and left because of ""the purge"".

Meanwhile the 20 that stayed post whatever they want whenever they want and maybe one or two videos a week gets removed. 

Nothing changed but people leaving, essentially."
"Then there's the opposite. Guys who have to say and do everything gay. 

In a conversation with an aquaintance I was explaining about a wine tasting event. His first and only question about it was ""is it gay?"". Like do you have to live your life in one big gay bubble?"
It may be fun for you but where will it lead to? Sometimes flirting is just flirting.
"I had a similar experience a year or two back. I was never what I would consider fat, but lost like 15 pounds and suddenly was getting hit up way more. Honestly, guys are superficial as fuck, and I would pretty much just drop contact with someone if I found out they were. Those are the kind of guys that would never stick with you when you need them most."
My birthday is also tomorrow! Twinsies!
"Mhmm no. Homosexuality was perfectly acceptable in Roman society. Same as Greek. Romans didn't think of sex and gender the same as we do now. They were far more gender based, in terms of your masculinity. Where the powerful and prestigious men had to be masculine. Also to note, they must be tops.

You were perfectly fine fucking any guys(or boys), or even being in a relationship with one. Assuming you are not the passive partner (Bottom). As that was seen as something shameful. This is mostly for the elite, common citizens really wouldn't have to deal with this.

This is also where Christianity got it's homophobia from, as to differ themselves from the more larger and popular Roman religion. They chose beliefs that were of the opposing view.

It sounds like something Nero would do, but your quoting something he did and saying that the actions of a crazy man somehow how define an entire empires history. Which simply is not really a good rule to go by ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
"I know someone who's gay, closeted, and never willing to come out.  He's now working in politics at the local level, he's conservative.  
  
Our friend group went to SF for the day, just to get out of town and ""do things"", right?  Friend splits off from us, is GONE for hours.  He comes back after ignoring our texts/calls and introduces us to his friend Calvin.  
  
When we're at a restaurant, Calvin is like wtf is this dude's problem.  Goes from super sweet and nice to suddenly uptight and freaking out now that he's around his friends again.  
  
Calvin doesn't have to tell us anything, our friend's obviously messed up hair and wrinkled clothes tell the story.  
  
We've all known since middle school and he's still denying it.  I feel like I'm going to see him in the news for being ""caught"" with another man someday.  
  
-- edit for clarity  
Calvin(the name I'm using in this story) is my friend's obvious hookup he found on Craigslist or something(this was nearly ten years ago, long before the removal of m4m and the like)."

"There are new challenges (study, work after college) but socially it gets better. High school drama bs dies out, and since colleges tend to be a lot bigger, it's easier to find people you can be friends with."
Fap fantasy material...
