You didn't ruin your parent's marriage. Your dad did. End of story.
"In fantasy, I'd watch this porno.  In reality, I'd scream for help"
"In medical school it was the day to practice the digital rectal exam (i.e. prostate exam). My classmates were getting nervous and I said ""what if I go on autopilot and stick a second finger in there? This is just another Tuesday for me!"""
"There doesn't seem to be all that much good advice out there about this problem, which is a very common one. Brace yourself for all the 'I've been with my husband for 25 years and I fuck him twice a day' comments that will be of no use to you whatsoever. Likewise the 'leave him' comments. 

It sounds to me like your husband is more into strangers than he is into you. I recognise it because I'm like this too. I think my problem stems from shame. Once my partner knows me intimately, I get awkward about having sex with him. I get pissed off and tell him he's doing stuff wrong. He's not seeing an image of me I want him to see any more - he's seeing *me*. He knows me too well, and I'm not confident enough in myself to think that anyone who sees the real me would find me attractive. I'm still turned on by him, but I don't believe he's really into me, and this makes for a humiliating experience. My reaction to it is anger, and perhaps a desire to humiliate my partner in return. This is just my experience in case it helps. "
"Was at a bar with friends. Some hole in the wall chill place. Anyway my friends looking at their cocktails and he says ‚Äúwhat do you think a ‚Äòslutty redhead‚Äô tastes like?‚Äù And without missing a beat I said ‚Äúsuck my dick and you‚Äôll find out‚Äù

Set up was too easy though"
"So she basically shopped around for a therapist that would tell her exactly what she wanted to hear?

She has a lot of issues and that‚Äôs on her, not you. 
It sucks, but it sounds like she will never accept she is wrong about this, and never accept you. You‚Äôve done the right thing by staying away from them."
"This is a general thing for both gay and straight people.

Attractive people are simply respected and highly valued. Thats life, its unfair.  Just focus trying to improve your own life, and the right people will come along, who cares about the rest."
When a man has his sleeves rolled up and I see his big forearms 
"Hey dude im a gay amputee with some scars myself.  It puts some guys off, but I figure that's a free screening method for guys that do really want to get to know me and know more about me. 

I follow some power lifter amputee blogs and workout a bit.  I also try to focus on my good stuff. 

You'll have to make sure you do that too.  You don't want to hide your handicaps but don't advertise then as your first feature. 

Dm me if you want to talk more.  And I'm sorry you're dealing with this.  "
The Lannister‚Äôs send their regards. 
"During Wrath of the Lich King, my previous GM and his wife were stepping away from the game to focus on their family. He asked if I would be the GM and I accepted. One day on vent they were going over some things they had learned. It went something like this: 

Him - Sometimes your strategy just won't work, even though you've been pushing it attempt after attempt. And so you'll have to abandon it. You'll have egg on your face, but that's it

Me - I've had worse on my face

His wife immediately burst into laughter and he was adorably awkward. "
"Life, in general, is easier if you meet your culture's standards of beauty.

If you're ugly you better be talented."
"My straight coworkers sometimes call each other out to check out customers wandering around. Last year on April Fools day they did it and one of them I wasn't sure if he knew. I went in the back and very straight-faced asked ""How come you guys never come get me when you're checking someone out? Do you think I'm gay or something?""

The awkwardness was so palpable. So satisfying. Stammers were had.

I broke the silence with something like ""APRIL FOOLS IM GAY AS HELL I DONT GIVE A SHIT"""
"Next time record them and send an email to the council.

Or... *death drop*.

"This. A thousand times this. Read it over and over until you truly \*understand\* what is being said here. And I know this doesn't help but... fuck your fuckin' dad, man. He sounds like a real piece of work."
I saw my crush teaching something to some teens and just about died. He'd be such a good Dad.
"When I was coming out as bi to my parents my Dad started going down the""it's a choice, you're not born like this"" road. I cut him off and said ""nature vs nurture, either way it's your fault."" 

Fortunately my parents also have a good sense of humor and were able to appreciate that one. It definitely could have backfired very easily. "
"""I like my coffee like I like my women.

... I don't like coffee."""
"Is this what it was like before Grindr!? 

There was this one time I was showering at a different gym and this muscle daddy with a MASSIVE dick (it was soft but I could tell) was showering. I got out and started drying off then he did too and was facing me so we both got a good look... Then as I was leaving he caught up to me and struck up a conversation about the shirt I was wearing. This was last week and I don't normally go at that hour but I might again just to see him. "
"Congrats!

I'm assuming if he's the first guy you ever kissed, he's also the first cock you sucked?

Sucking cock is amazing and getting another dude off, seeing him cum, makes for an amazing time.

Hope you enjoyed it and you'll remember your first forever."
"Pulling a shirt over his head, so for a moment he‚Äôs vulnerable and I can see every muscle flex with his arms over his head. Slowly his back and shoulders are revealed üí¶ bonus points if he uses the balled up shirt to wipe sweat off his neck and chest with the fabric clenched in one hand. 

Extra bonus points if he then wipes his forehead with the back of his wrist, then throws the wadded up, dirty shirt on a nearby milk crate and bends back over the engine bay, frowning at whatever is wrong in there. "
Nothing better than a guy just smiling at what I have to say or looking interested in the conversation.  
Musculy guys into getting plowed is my happy place.
Lol I‚Äôd feel so patronized if a guy called me a ‚Äúgood lad‚Äù for coming but congrats on having a good time
"Haha - this happened to my ex's classmate. They were practicing and he went to use 2 fingers. The supervising doc was like ""No, no, just 1"". "
"Caught in a shower stall, no escape from reality üéµüéµüéµ"
"&gt; I literally just let the guy out of my house who took my anal virginity. 

I read this and thought you meant you had been holding him hostage there for some amount of time"
"You are not alone.  It is not that I have never had anal, it just isn't my thing."
The person she's singing about came out as gay eventually. Fun fact.
"What's a non sexual act that turns you on? ""Oh you know  just your usual being treated like a human being"""
"My friends were talking about a girl who blows her friend for weed. They all said ""wow, free blowjobs"" and I was like ""dude, free weed!"""
How'd you end up at this? I'm always curious how seemingly most other gay guys' lives are basically pornos.
"This is more as a result of the gay lifestyle.  My buddy and I were going out to get dinner and we hooked up while I was picking him up from his house.  So we finished dinner and the waitress who we‚Äôve been joking around with brings the bill. I put my card on it and tell her ‚ÄúYou can just split it down the middle‚Äù and he responds ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre not gonna pay for dinner?‚Äù  To which I responded ‚ÄúIf you wanted me to pay, you should‚Äôve waited till after dinner to put out.‚Äù"
I'm just hopeless
It's never too late. And university kids are usually open minded. Congrats tho
"The law is antigay but my close friends have accepted me. My family don't know about my orientation and I don't want to say it them. 
I can say else that people in Russia getting tolerant day by day and it's awesome. "
"Yes he was the first. It sounds weird but the feeling of my mouth being ""full"" was awesome. And its so soft but yet hard at the same time. "
"I came out over Christmas break. When my parents were together in private for the first time my dad said ‚Äú well, he sure made the Yuletide gay‚Äú "
Good old fashioned cruising.  Feel free to write in again when you've built up the nerve to participate.  Hot üòÅ!
"I work at a restaurant in the kitchen and held the door for a waitress and she was all ""Thanks so much!!!"" And I replied ""Well, I may be a princess but I was raised a gentleman"""
"&gt;So she basically shopped around for a therapist that would tell her exactly what she wanted to hear?

We don't call it ""the christian echo chamber"" for nothing."
Where is this even coming from and who is even saying this...
This is not your fault... You did no wrong. Maybe see if your brother can help your mom if she won't let you help her?
Is this the real life? Or is it just fantasy? üéµ

Don't know why this made me laugh so hard

What a positive way to think about it"
"Fun fact, this song isn't actually new... Just newly produced.

There was a video online that was a young Billie singing this song while playing a guitar (no editing, just a simple phone video). She even talked about the meaning behind it in that video as well. Unfortunately, I can not find this video, but I do know it was online before ""You Should Me in a Crown"" was posted."
Hope you safe
"One time my family was visiting my grandma, who was slipping into deep senility, and she was talking about some family member/ancestor of mine. At one point she goes, ‚Äúand you know, he was actually a Rear Admiral.‚Äù And from the back of the car I was like ‚Äúoh, me too!‚Äù

And we all started laughing (Grandma didn‚Äôt get it, or maybe she did, who knows) and my mom turned around and gave me the smirking but wide-mouthed OMG YOU DIDN‚ÄôT. "
I Know it won‚Äôt solve my depression and anxiety and bring me a lifetime full of happiness and rainbows but it would be nice to connect with someone romantically emotionally physically etc. 
"You're a good writer. Just can't tell if it's creative fiction or creative non-fiction.

"You should simply ignore her until she understands that it‚Äôs not all about her.  You did not ‚Äúsucker punch‚Äù the family.  God, talk about a drama queen!  

If she ever wants to have a conversation, it must start with her acknowledging the bullshit she wrote and how she has come to terms with and accepted you as you are.  Without that, you leave yourself open to more of her whining, self-absorption, mudslinging and attempts to guilt trip you.

Get rid of toxic people in your life (even if they are family members) until they grow up and can have an adult conversation with you.  You deserve far better than you‚Äôve been treated!"
You joke but yes.

&amp;#x200B;

It's the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, try to help your mom, maybe tell her that she can stay with you until that other house is fixed or something? A temporary solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Ignore your brother, he was raised by your dad, so you know."
"Same here, seeing a big guy get topped by a smaller guy is incredibly hot!"
"THANK YOU!!! Really appreciate your response! This helps a great deal. I recognize the anger component very very well. This is my man as well. It is so weird. I can walk up to him and hug him and kiss him through out the course of the day and he responds warm and lovingly. If I touch him in sexual part of his body (his cock, ass or nips) I have gotten anything from cold indifference to flat out ""I don't like that at all through a shirt!""   HUH? Not a problem for all these years all of the sudden it is uncomfortable? 

I believe it is tied to shame as well. I read ""The Velvet Rage"" and it totally makes sense. The more we fell in love the more indifferent he became towards me intimately. I am SURE this is why his past relationships failed. 

I have tried talking with him over the years. It gets better for a little while then RIGHT back to where it was with added ""rules"" when it comes to sex. (Every other area he is loving, kind, and a FANTASTIC husband) I've been damn depressed lately realizing all the talking in the world won't change this. HOW can this be healed? HOW can I help him heal this shame? that is the real question. 

You are right. Most are just ""leave"" but I am totally in Love with him. He is my best friend and husband. Our home is loving and full of laughter. Why would I leave the love of my life? He has helped me heal in so many areas...I want to help him heal as well. "
"In my masters of counseling program, we took a class on culture and diversity. We were splitting into groups to present on different cultures or minority groups. The only rule was you can‚Äôt be in the group presentation if you belong to that group (so for example because I‚Äôm white, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to volunteer for the group on European cultures). The teacher is asking for volunteers for the different groups like Latinx cultures, African cultures etc, and hardly anyone was volunteering for any group. Then the teacher asked for volunteers for gender and sexual minorities (LGBTQ group) and half the class raised their hands super fast. 

I blurted out ‚ÄúWOWWWW! We get it, you‚Äôre straight!‚Äù

And that‚Äôs how I shattered any doubts about my sexual identity in the program. "
Fan fic probably. Nice writing still
"Open your eyes, look up through my thighs and seeee......"
"I'm a chubby bear, and one of my straight coworkers made a good joke last year about me. My manager came to check on my progress on this big project I had been assigned. When he was satisfied with my progress, he walked back to his area and spoke to my coworker. In regards to my work and how I was coming along my manager said, ""Zobe seems to be in pretty good shape."" My coworker, with a straight face says, ""If he was in good shape then he'd be an otter."" It took a minute for the joke to sink in. "
‚Äú...Nowhere near my genitals‚Äù
"I dated a man in a wheelchair for awhile, and when we first got together some people I knew were crude about it, asking shit like if he could get it up for if I was the top, just to remember one instance. I cut those people out pretty immediately. 
There will be someone that sees your scars, inside and out, and sees the beauty in the valleys and landscapes of your pain. They‚Äôll see that you‚Äôre more than these things, too. 
You are not alone. "
"God I love those gay bar jokes 


Some guy was serving me and my friends. He‚Äôs very British so we were talking as he was taking our order, he said ‚ÄúKnow what I could really go for a fag right now‚Äù and I replied with ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm right here!‚Äù 


He ended up asking for my number at the end of the night so we could go out but I never received a text lol "
A lot of the commenters saying ‚Äúleave him‚Äù probably haven‚Äôt been in a _12 year relationship_. That‚Äôs a very long time and I‚Äôm sure things work differently than a relationship that‚Äôs gone on for half a year. Take advice here with a grain of salt.

Because the black hole everyone else is excited about represents a technological marvel for our entire species.
Some people just don't like gay guys in general. Being feminine just makes it obvious that you're gay.
"Mamaaaaaa

"Construction is one of the last of the old-fashioned ""he-man"" occupations where the men employed are constantly trying to prove their masculinity to one another. (Jobs like these are some of the last in our technological society to require physical strength.) When they yell things at you, it's less about you and more about them signalling their hypermasculinity to one another. They probably see your pants as ""women's pants."" Just remember that it's about them and not really about you. You simply presented an occasion for them to posture for one another."
That‚Äôs always worth a stop and stare
"The host messaged me on grindr, we had coffee over the weekend and he told me all about the party plans. "
"Not my joke, but about me. Just yesterday at the dinner table we were discussing beverages. I don't like to anything but water, really.

Sister: ""How do you not like milk in your coffee?""

Me: ""Just don't. The consistency bugs me. Like pop, I'm not about swallowing thick, syrupy shit.""

Brother in law: ""HA! You fuckin' liar.""



Also, my favorite go-to joke -

"It sounds like your friend has expressed a reasonable request to you that you're ignoring. You should be a good person and friend by respecting that.  If touching of any kind is non-consentual, you shouldn't do it."
Is it only the law antigay or would your friends and family report you? 
"I think some of the sexiest none sexual things that I could imagine a guy doing are:
1. Looking in my eyes and doing that like iconic ""I'm going to die by your side"" smirk.
2. Contagious and real laughter
3. Doing any type of handiwork, especially if we're doing it together
4. Wearing shorts... I'm a legs guy lol"
...reads like a porn plot line.
"I was talking to a guy on Grindr and pretty quickly switched over to text. After talking for only TWO DAYS, he became clingy and I got such a bad vibe from it. I made up a dumb reason that it wouldn‚Äôt work out. He was devastated, tried calling my phone over and over, sent me voice memos of him crying, had two of his fiends text me from their phones, and posted an Instagram story (which I only saw because one of his friends sent it to me) about how much he hated some shallow gays along with screenshots of our convo.   It was literally a night from hell."
"Mine neither. However, I'll do anal if the other guy wants to. But... I'd rather not do it lol."
"My take on this is that it depends a lot on who I'm having sex with. I've been up for sex with some guys, but others I've been ""side"", because it doesn't work the same way or it isn't as satisfactory."
Fuck. This made me laugh. 
Man. I'm also stocky/bearish. I speak 4 languages. My greatest aspiration in life is to get slim so I can be a Polyglotter 
Piece of work = piece of shit.
"For me, it was like the 4th or 5th time I had sex with a guy (when I was 19), I suddenly realized... yes. I'm 100% gay. Not bisexual. No more girlfriends after this. It was quite the epiphany."

"As far as I can tell some Queer people are getting pissy because they expected the song to be an LGBTQ empowerment song. It's a song about a straight girl who would prefer that her disinterested boyfriend were gay as the reason he wasn't interested in her. It's an interesting take on the situation because there are people broken up when they learn their SO/spouse is gay and not into them.

While the song doesn't seem fetishizing to Gay men to me, I welcome alternate thoughts on subject."

"We can but it will have bad effects... I mean that if I just say ""I'm gay/ I love guys"" someone can hit me and if I'll go to court and the court will decide in the direction of the one who hit me... Also it Russia is a law about gay propaganda, due to it some gays are it the jail. 
Of course not every time it happens but... "
I think that says a lot about us as a society lol
no lol. As an athlete I‚Äôm quite desensitized to that body type so it‚Äôs really not something I expect or need
"I look at porn. I look at random hot guys. I notice people for totally shallow physical reasons. And my brain makes up a backstory to fill in the blanks about how we know each other, how we met, to complete the fantasy with a human connection. 

It‚Äôs easy for me to see I enjoy totally shallow lusty things about men. But I‚Äôve always imagined the rest of the relationship to go along with it."
You have holes. He may want to be into them. 
"I was standing in a crowd, waiting to get our ""class picture"" taken when I was volunteering in AmeriCorps NCCC and the photographer says ""Look straight, everyone,"" and I don't even think I thought about it and just yelled back to her ""I don't know how!"""

"I encourage my husband to eat healthy with me, but never shame him about his body. Likewise, he encourages me to keep a healthy eye on my finances, which is a good reminder considering my personality. 

So I guess yeah, we both push each other to be the best we can be within the context of our lives. For example, his work is more time consuming and stressful, so it would be shitty of me to assume he could hit the gym as often as myself. "
It was actually in the parking lot outside which I feel makes it even more likely he is gay because he went so far out of his way lol
Wow. I live in Moldova and people here are getting LESS tolerant and less tolerant every day.

"""Who's the dominant one now, good lad?"""
Man I hope you find your guy eventually! It's really sad that happened to you. You seem like a great guy from how you dedicated your life to saving others and all. I'd date a caring man like that even with physical handicaps.
"I'm sorry.  That sucks.

Your mom sounds like she has some serious mental health issues.  Many people with undiagnosed mental health issues tend to invest themselves too much in religion, because it's designed to cater to people in mentally weakened states.  My boyfriend's mom was the same way.  Turns out she is a rapid cycling bipolar manic depressive.  She's now on lots of medication and it has really helped her.  She stopped all the religious bullshit and is now quite normal.

Your mom wants to make this all about her.  How it hurt her.  How it affects her life.  She's being an incredibly selfish woman.  It sucks when you realize your parents aren't the superheros you expect them to be.  You grow and realize they sometimes have significant flaws.

There's not much you can do.  Keep her at arm's length until she agrees to see a fully qualified psychologist - Not some religious nut-job that will tell her exactly what she wants to hear.   It sounds like the first therapist tried to explain to her that she was the problem, and she bailed on that one."
"I'd suggest emailing her back stating:
""Do not bother emailing this address again, this message is to inform you I will have blocked all incoming emails from you, and other accounts that I do not have in my address book.
If you decide that you will just come visit me and show up at the apartment, you'll find new tenants, so visit them if you wish, but you won't find me there as I've moved. Goodbye. ""

Then I'd suggest changing whatever door mat or front door decor and curtains etc.

"Here is my honest thought. As someone who spends a lot of time studying and arguing about ethics, morals and the law, I have never understood the stigma against incest. Of course, the inbreeding argument is valid, but in your case that obviously does not apply. Sexual abuse and even rape (sometimes statutory rape) are also concerns, and in many incest cases these unfortunately happen to be present. Again, none of these apply in your scenario.

When it comes down to it, if you ask people what's wrong with incest in your specific situation (that of two consenting twin brothers), they cannot rely on any of the above arguments people usually raise against incest. What they will usually tell you is it's disgusting, it's unnatural. Why? No answer. And aren't these precisely the adjectives people used to, and sadly some still do, describe gay people with?

That's just my humble opinion of course, but I think advocates of gay rights are hypocrites if they are, for whatever reason, against your relationship with your brother.

Tread carefully. Whatever happens in life, stay happy and stay safe are the mottos I go by. Do not give up on love, if you truly believe in it, but be very careful about telling other people as well, for fear of the severe stigma of it. Even telling family might not be a good idea. Sadly, this is not something people ever address and it is a gigantic inadequacy in the realm of human rights.

Whatever happens, I wish you all the best."
"&amp; to actually answer your question, it‚Äôs just because they want somebody to bully. It‚Äôs as simple as that really."
"You shouldn't feel bad. I don't see any reason your sexuality has any place in your work. If you want to tell people fine, but a coworker has no right to do that."

Nvm. You could be ugly from a super rich family. Then looks or talent wont matter much.
"&gt;If she ever wants to have a conversation, it must start with her acknowledging the bullshit she wrote and how she has come to terms with and accepted you as you are.

Unfortunately she has escalated things to the point that OP can never really speak to her with any kind of trust that she will give such an acknowledgement instead of abuse - even if he cuts her off and she gets a third party to try to arrange a meeting, he can't trust that it's not just a ruse on her part to get him where she can be abusive to him again. 

(I'm remembering when I was in college there was a guy in the gay student group whose family reacted very badly to him coming out. A month or two later he got a call from his mother that his father had had a heart attack, was dying in the hospital, and was asking for him. The guy I knew hopped on the next plane. When he arrived at the airport both parents were waiting for him, with their christian minister there to take custody of him to ""convert"" him. He walked up to the airline desk and used the remainder of his bank account to book himself onto the next flight back to Boston and never spoke to them again.)"
"I once changed urologists as my old one retired. He came bathing into the exam room and told me to drop my pants, underwear too. He then proceeded to feel my malls and stick a finger up my ass. I just thought to myself that I‚Äôd had dated like that"
"So I was sitting at the kitchen counter at the firehouse I used to volunteer at, and I'd gotten into a car accident earlier in the day on the way in. There was like 8 of us there and I said, ""Hey, does anybody know a good body shop? I got rear ended on the way in, and no that's not a euphemism."" I don't know if everyone was just awkward or missed it, but I locked eyes with one guy and he just started laughing. "
Suck dicks....he made that pretty clear.

"Summed it up perfectly.

"The sensitivity training does a few things.

First and foremost it covers the company to an extent by showing that they made steps to curb and inform people that  this behavior was inappropriate on a broad scale.

The real benefits come from the fact that anyone who might be encouraged by that guys behaviors are discouraged from doing so. 

From that point on, people who act is such a manner have already been informed that it's not acceptable, and HR may be clear to take more direct actions up to and including termination."
"I mean... It's not so bad if the guy across from you is hot and there's no excessive perviness from either party. I don't mind glances my way, but beating your dick is another level. "
Damn she even starts with a disclaimer lol and the guy she made the song about actually ended up being gay.
"Maybe you can respond in this way:  "" I am in receipt of your recent text.   You are not ready to deal with me as I really am, and I am not not willing to deal with you unless you can do so.   I am not going to respond further to your efforts to guilt-trip me.""

"I come from an extremely religious back ground and my uncle and cousin are pastors. My cousin happened to be the youth pastor at this church and I went with him (for support) and he started a prayer circle. So we formed a circle and they decided to get on their knees. 

So I piped up: woah, THIS is a prayer circle? I just did this last night....

Needless to say, I wasn‚Äôt invited back. "

I‚Äôm not really that feminine. I mean I‚Äôm not really masculine either I‚Äôm just surprised that I was picked on this harshly
"I've evolved to becoming a side. Not that I feel anal can't be fun - it can. But I feel like sex that requires training and constant practice just no to get get hurt is not worth my time. I literally see more value in an hour at the gym.

A side note (lol). Once I ""came out"" as a side on Grindr, my hooking up day were over. Between the laws of attraction and the limited scope of what I'm willing to do, the interest dwindled to practically nothing."
Well I am a pretty short guy 5 foot 4 bi guy and guys care less about my height than girls
"I wouldn't worry about it too much.  It's porn.  I like watching some messed up stuff too but that does NOT mean I want to be on either side of it IRL.

At most, just metaphorically backhand him (assuming it's a 1v1 talk, not a group conversation) if he brings up it being weird again.  ""Yeah, it's weird.  And you jack off to it.  You can stop lambasting it now."""
Yeah I only realized it in my 20s even tho I was watching gay porn since i was 13

"My worst hookup was when I saw what I was confident was a worm wriggling out of this guy's asshole. We were 69ing and I was underneath so I had a fairly comprehensive view of his anus. Earlier when I asked him if he liked being rimmed and he hesitated before saying no... I think he totally knew he was contagious as hell. Three weeks later my ass is on fire and I'm running to the STI clinic to get checked out and *surprise, surprise,* they tell me I've got worms. I confronted him about it on Grindr later and he just insta-blocked me.

Would it really have killed him to wait just a bit long for meds to clear him up before meeting someone? Also, he had red leather sofas and was generally really leery and creepy, but the worm was the... cherry on the cake? Urrrgghhh."
[blinking intensifies] 
"I‚Äôm definitely a side.  I used to top or bottom but realized it didn‚Äôt really spark joy (plus it can be messy), so I usually do oral and nippleplay; both of which are far more pleasurable to me."
"I'm FTM trans and have a small beard, deep voice, etc. 
Short one: 
Every opportunity to say ""Well before I got my boobs removed..."" 


Long one: 

I spent a lot of time at work with a girl and she was one of two people there that knew I was trans. We were in a meeting and I was super obviously grumpy and I realized I had started my period so I whispered to her if I could borrow a tampon. She's got the same sick humor I do and she immediately took out a tampon AND a pad, set it on the table for everyone to see right in front of me. 

I took it and immediately went to the restroom and apparently as I left she told everyone I'm on my man period. Everyone took it as a planned out joke since I was, after all, being a dick that day out of grumpiness.

"Unfortunately one of the biggest reasons i carry the label *gay* is for male genitalia. It seems that phalloplasty (i think that's the term) is in its infancy stages. So of they did have a penis, yes.

I understand many gay men are gay for gender and not sex, aswell as some are a combination and more, unfortunately i am not. I both have genital repulsion to every real life vagina I've seen and most drawn I've seen and i would find it very hard having a partner without a penis.

Nothing but support to trans people though. I know your struggles are really rough and i hope we can see some unprecedented progress relatively soon"

Talking with a torso for a couple days only to realize it was a good friend of mine (with no chemistry)....super awkward for a while. But now we laugh about it.
You need to stop doing it in the kitchen
Thank you:)
"""I know they are just saying what everyone else is thinking"". No. You're assuming. Children do not by any means have some kind of unclouded, true view of the world. They misunderstand many things, are not aware of context, lack experience, etc. In no way should you assume that the reactions of children reflect the true feelings of adults."
I had a fashion model roommate for a couple of years. Can confirm. The way people would fawn over him was highly amusing.

"1. You can email to tell her you're blocking her email and no further messages from her will be received, before you block it. 
2. If she shows up at your doorstep, tell her to go away, and if she refuses, pull out your phone and call the police. Just because she was your mother once before she threw you away doesn't entitle her to special treatment if she decides to act stalkery to you. (I also had to order my mother to leave me alone, call the cops, get a restraining order, etc, for different reasons.) 
3. You could move. No doubt sooner or later you *will*."
I get turned on by big forearms of guys who are rolling their sleeves. I just find it so masculine.

"And I gotta say, this might sound totally cliche but carrying yourself with confidence may be one of the most attractive things ever. You may not be physically attractive but a confident look and sound is incredibly hot. I know a lot of guys who aren't exactly conventionally attractive but the way they carry themselves in other areas makes up for it. Things like intelligence and personality really do sometimes overtake physical attraction, and there are people who are more mentally attracted to others so I'm sure you'll find the right guy eventually, just don't worry man."
SCREAMING
"It's very possible. People often project their experiences on others and assume them to be universal.

Another example would be gay people thinking bisexuals are just gays in denial because they themselves first came out as bi as a stepping stone before finding out/admitting to themselves they were gay."
Thank you. I‚Äôve been planning to get two dobermans. Nothing‚Äôs cuter than a femme guy (I mean I‚Äôm not even femme!!! I mean I don‚Äôt consider myself one) with two dogs that will easily rip you apart üòé
Thanks Oprah.
"I love feeling patronized and cared for. It's like pretending that I *need* an older man to be in charge and to help me through mundane goals like coming. lol If the top said ""good boy"" or something like that to me, I'd be super happy, satisfied, and proud. Maybe I have daddy issues?"

I think it's great that you encourage him to experiment. Would you like to be involved in that? If that's the case I'd recommend setting up a joint profile may be  in Grindr and try to find someone you both like.
I wonder what's this called in spanish
"It's really not that uncommon, it's where the mentality of ""if you can't love yourself, no one else can love you either"" comes from. 


An individual that has low self worth will inevitably start to resent individuals that see value in them because they're so incapable of seeing that value themselves (this is especially common in relationships where a high level of openness is often achieved). The logical conclusion within this mindset is that the other person is the problem, delusional, has low standards, is being pitiful, etc."
"My coworkers and my boss wanted to surprise me with some cake or something for my birthday. When they were discussing what kind to get me my boss asked ,""Does anyone know what flavor A1ni1am would like?"" To which a coworker responded ""I think he likes fruity flavors."" And a good friend of mine just sighed and said, ""of course he likes the fruity flavors.""

They all told me the story after I got the cake and I thought that it was hilarious."
"My boyfriend plays the bass and nothing turns me on more than him playing a song and really getting in to the tune. The concentration, the determination and the proud 'i'm smashing this' look in his face. Damn."
"New perspective: the 30 and up guys in my classes through college were total zaddies and liked by everyone specifically because of their age. It‚Äôs different for sure, but if you highlight the positives about your age instead of the negatives you‚Äôll have something nobody else has. Just be you, nobody at university has their shit together as much as you! "
"I've had a threesome with identical twins Bennie, so... wouldn't bother me.

The whole breaking up with your boyfriend for you is a red flag though. I'm more worried about that than about the twincest aspect."
You need to call the cops 
"Fairly attractive, straight acting gay guy. I am indeed no one's ""gay best friend"". 

My sisters both tried temporarily when I first came out, but they quickly realized that my poorly decorated room and wardrobe of hoodies and cargo shorts weren't a facade - I genuinely have no sense of design or fashion."
My hoe phase was an anthropological study of gay living spaces.
"Congratulations on making the leap from the security guard job!   Listen.  DON'T be embarrassed.   Be proud and glad.   I am now retired, but I went through two career changes before I settled into my field in my mid 30's.   That is very very common in this economy."

"My partner and I have sex when we feel like it... If there's some impending reason why he can't f*cked at that moment he just tells me and we postpone or masturbate. 

Go with the flow. It's a lot more fun that way."

"So definitely none of their fucking business, it sounds like"

Absolutely not. But other guys were. 
My friend (openly gay) and I (bisexual) are in a drawing class one day. And he was unscrewing something and the cap popped off in his face. Then he goes  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the first time something‚Äôs shot off in my face.‚Äù I was crying on the floor. 
That is so ridiculous and backwards. Hope you are okay

"I don't have social anxiety or anything, I'm just generically introverted, and experiences like this are the bane of my existence. I just can't deal with not being able to interact with guys (and people in general) on my own terms (like, say, trying to take a shower and having random strangers staring at me at their leisure).

*Huge* nope. Even showers with my boyfriend don't come naturally to me."
"Porn Tumblr getting destroyed has completely deprived me on any interesting, actually diverse porn.  It‚Äôs so sad"

"The person that wrote the pride.com article they're citing has like the worst self description blurb I've ever read. I understand the whole ""Beyonc√© made me gay"" thing is a joke, but it doesn't actually say anything about the person's credentials. I know that he's a Texas Gay guy with a love of YA fiction, that's it. No credentials, at all. I'm pretty sure he's one of those not growing up people in their 20s too. It used to be that if you collected something or liked something that wasn't a substitute for your personality. Having all the Harry Potter/Marvel Funko pop figurines in your house seems like a really tacky way to express love for something. 
[RANT]
Cheap Vinyl Figurines are fine if you like that sort of thing but it's strange to be 27 and see the dichotomy of half the people my age being young working professionals with tastefully decorated homes and the rest turn their entire space into a teenager's bedroom of sorts where they watch Anime and collect cats.

Oh my god
"Thats awesome! I‚Äôm glad that you had a good first experience dating.  Go out there and meet guys. Take your time to find out what you like and don‚Äôt like before you settle down. Enjoy yourself but just be safe and wear a condom. Since you just became sexually active with men, have you considered taking PrEP? Along with condoms, it reduces your chances of contracting HIV to practically zero when you take it as directed .  And of course you decrease your risk of other STI‚Äôs with the condom.  It‚Äôs just another line of defence as you continue to discover your sexuality :-)"
"I usually consider myself verse bottom, but when I see a guy that's taller than me and has a scruffy and beefy body, my dick twitches for that ass."

"Got into the car of a 53 year old who just didn‚Äôt look like what I was expecting when I was 16. He was scary and his photo was mad deceptive. Convinced him to pull over somewhere and I ran home in the rain. I‚Äôm 19 now and it‚Äôs feels like it was a while ago so I might have been younger but I‚Äôm pretty sure I was 16.

You have daddy issues
Looks like a great way to get hurt and have an amazingly dumb story to tell after. 
I wish my husband was real 
"I was working in the kitchen at work and had to clean the bench where we prepare the food during service. I scraped it down and it was pretty gross. I turned to my manager and a team member, showed them the dirty spatula and said ""this is what my ass looks like after sex"". The looks on their faces before they laughed were fucking gold."
"My husband and I recently have much better jobs that we had for the first several years of our relationship, and are finally living a very comfortable lifestyle. The other day we were shopping for a new desk chair for him and while discussing whether to go with a cheaper option or splurge on something really comfortable. We started to think about it and decided that if he REALLY wanted to, he could buy pretty much anything he wanted and it wouldn‚Äôt affect our ability to pay our rent or bills or whatever this month. I swear to god it made me so horny that we almost had to go to the car and take care of ourselves. There was something about the security of being financially stable that was a huge turn on. I can‚Äôt explain it better than that but it was intense "
Since when did average size become ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù? 
"It‚Äôs gonna sound corny, but things get better man. Hang in there, okay?"
I wish she‚Äôd make a music video out of this with a very hot guy.
"&gt; The President of a gay hookup app is against same sex marriage? 

It makes sense from a financial perspective. His company benefits from gay hookup culture and non-monogamy. Why should he want gays to get married and settled down? "
"I am very pro trans rights, and I have yet to encounter any trans person who demands that I sleep with them. 

However, I do wonder what trans women are doing on Grindr. I get that you are still attracted to men, but I am not on there to look for a woman to fuck."
"He should have been a little more up front about himself. It's sad, but he's only setting himself up for this reaction every time."
That sounds absolutely grueling.
I love your dad's humor. 
BOTTOM TEXT
"must be, but first I read GM as ""general manager"" and none of it fit together at all."
"Literally none of this is your fault and don't let anyone make you think it is. 

First, your dad is a major asshole.
Second, your brother is a minor asshole.

If they can't accept you for who you are then they don't deserve to be in _your_ life.

*Most importantly, don't feel like it's your fault that your dad kicked out your mom. Obviously they didn't have such a strong marriage if after one argument he kicks her out. Your mom will probably be happier without him.*"
"No, he is fucking with his brother"
"Wow. What the fuck do you need, an engraved invitation?"
"Were you equally attracted to all the guys, and if not how did you handle the ones you didn't find attractive? You said they all sucked your dick but was it in any way reluctant from your side?"
Doesn‚Äôt have own any books or reads. Really into taking dumb Snapchat pictures. 
Similar situation but there‚Äôs no third involved. Just indifference and annoying rules when it comes to sex. It‚Äôs tiring and idk what to do. I don‚Äôt think opening it up is the solution for us. 
I'm the complete opposite - I almost never fantasize about people I know irl. It happens occasionally but it's pretty rare.
