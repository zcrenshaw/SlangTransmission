the gay agenda needs more people being whoever the hell they want to be as long as they're not assholes.
"Plot twist, they're the same guy."
I brought croissants to my saturday morning hookup a couple weeks ago.
"When guys started growing body hair, I started getting very interested. I used to straight up stare at happy trails and chest hair and armpit hair (I still kinda do). Before this, I just assumed I didn‚Äôt like anything or anyone but when I was in my freshman art class, a senior TA came in wearing a tank top. He yawned, sat back in his chair and stretched and I literally drooled over his stomach hair, armpit hair and the top of his pubes docking out of his shorts. It ruined me! I‚ÄôM WEAK!"
Maybe was the guy catfishing you and hoped you‚Äôd fuck him even though he looked nothing like the pics he‚Äôs sent? That has def happened to me.
Because America is so greedy they would rather people die than help them live if it makes them money

Jack off twice before you go to your appointment.
"You're supposed to bring glazed donuts to a hookup.  


""Maky my hole look like this"""
17. My parents were divorced and didn‚Äôt compare notes. Told mom I was going to dad‚Äôs for the weekend. Told dad I was going to mom‚Äôs. Bought a cheap flight to Miami where I met up with my internet boyfriend. We rented a cheap motel and fucked all weekend.
I thought that the guy from Grindr and his dad pulled up TOGETHER
"I had been thinking about it but wasn't sure until:
16 playing rugby and I scored a tri. Another player (a prop) hugged me from behind and I felt that he was half hard on my ass. I didn't want to let go ao I held his arms against me for a little while. 

Fun side note, we're together now!"
My friends started getting interested in girls and I started getting interested in my friends.
"Yep. I 'm in the middle of changing my Grindr profile from ""EAT MY ASS"" to ""Cuddle-Little Spoon-Boyfriend Experience"""
"Holy crap I FUCKING LOVED THIS SHOW AS A KID. I STILL DO, ACTUALLY.

That's crazy. I never thought this show would have covered gay marriage."
"We needed more wholesome content here and less ""owo i wanna succ pp""

Good post OP. Your husband sounds rad."
I had a hook up help me fold laundry before we messed around. I want to make that a thing!
How did she find out? Did she read your notes from the meetings?
I could never invite a stranger from Grindr to my parents' house when I was living with them.
"I‚Äôll comment just because mine seems so different to most! 

It was the mid 90‚Äôs. I was 15 he was 14 and my best friend. It was a sleep over with another friend  and we ended up touching each other whilst half asleep. Just us two, we kinda left out the 3rd friend, who was fast asleep anyway.

Next day at school we were both terrified, terrified other people would find out, terrified we‚Äôd lose each other. After a very difficult, quiet conversation we agreed not to tell anyone and I distinctly remember the  last few words ‚Äúbut I‚Äôd like it to happen again ‚Äú yeah me too‚Äù and us both beaming with smiles. 

The following weekend I stayed over at his house and we immediately fell into each other‚Äôs arms and couldn‚Äôt keep ourselves apart.

That was over 20 years ago and he‚Äôs still asleep next to me right now :D

We‚Äôve had our ups and downs but I have no doubt I will be with him for the rest of my life"
"It‚Äôs bizarre isn‚Äôt it. Like, if by some miracle you managed to get a straight guy to sleep with you, it‚Äôs gonna be a pretty boring, one sided experience. It‚Äôs hardly gonna be a fully reciprocal, enthusiastic, passionate experience.

I slept with a closeted bi guy a few times. He clearly wasn‚Äôt comfortable with the fact he was into guys, and sex consisted of me sucking him off and him fucking me. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs not a great experience for me. I‚Äôd much rather be with another gay guy where it‚Äôs no rules sex."
"Grindr hookup who was kinda crazy and I never saw again

:/"
"Get that dick, slut."
It's normal to hate/resent your family for a multitude of reasons.
"I was 20 when I met a guy that was my colleague's friend. We started to chat but I didn't came out to him.

My colleague made a party in his house, I talked a lot with him and I saw the way he looked at me. I was drunk so I kissed him in front everyone, hat's how I came out to my friends. After that we went to a room and had sex."
21 and still wearing the V card. I am not in a rush to have sex I would prefer to met someone I like first.
"So long as what you're disliking about James Charles is his atrocious, perhaps even predatory personality, then so be it. But all to often with this kind of talk it's just a thin veil to bash on femme people as some kind of ""caricatures"" that aren't even true to themselves, and glorifying straight-acting as THE way to be. It gets pretty grating, pretty fast."
"I think you're underestimating just how thirsty gay guys are for straight guys.

If you told them to put a firework up their arse they'd probably do it."
A week? You wouldn‚Äôt even be dumping him - it‚Äôs a WEEK
"Americans don‚Äôt view healthcare as a right.  Almost every industrialized nation treats healthcare as a right any they focus on preventing disease.

Here you have no right to access medications to prevent disease, unless you‚Äôre wealthy enough to obtain it.

Our healthcare culture is profoundly broken."
My Arthur slash fiction has become canon!!
"In a corn field, some distance away from a bonfire party I was at. This involved numerous mosquito bites, and a very pervy groundhog."
"What the actual fuck.. I will never understand the level of narcissism and assholery required to fuel this kind of behavior.

The universe has a way of dealing with this foolishness."
"no, it's not on you.

he has a heart condition."
I‚Äôm naturally hairy pretty much below the waist. I get nothing but compliments. Especially from naturally smooth guys.
"A lot of my hook-ups are like this, and it's not too hard to find guys looking for that sort of thing. There just isn't a commonly understood way to ask for it.

I've been saying for a while that we should adopt the idea of the ""girlfriend experience"" from prostitution (or at least from prostitution in TV/movies lol)."
"NOT Chocolate glazed, though."
I‚Äôm going to print this out and make it my mantra so that I can be the type of husband you have.
"Sophomore year, college in the 90‚Äôs. Chapter room fraternity house. I was a closeted pledge. We had a graffiti party... everyone wore white t-shirts and wrote with marker  on each other. As a senior, the chapter VP had his own room.

I ended up alone with him at the end of the night in his room. We started wrestling and writing on each other‚Äôs shirts. I got a raging hard on and thought I can‚Äôt let him know. Meanwhile he wrestles so he‚Äôs on top of me and while I‚Äôm trying to twist my hips so my hard on isn‚Äôt pressed against him, he starts kissing me and grabbing my dick. Yeah I know, two drunk fraternity guys wrestling, not gay at all. I was totally shocked in the moment but totally into it.

I really wasn‚Äôt expecting something like this to happen with a fraternity brother at that time. If only I knew then what I know now. Lol.
We almost got caught by some other seniors who started teasing him why he had a pledge in his room. 

The next weekend following another party, we snuck into the chapter room which was off limits during parties or at night. We got full on naked with each other on the pool table. Very classy, I know. Totally awesome. Almost got caught again when someone starts banging on the door asking who‚Äôs in there. We froze, mind you he had just started rimming me for the first time in my life. Thank god the door was locked.

Funny enough years later I ran into a fraternity brother at the eagle in NYC. Turns out a lot more gay sex was happening in the house. I had thought we were the only ones at the time although I had my suspicions."
"I don't think we should be judging who is the right ""gay""

&amp;#x200B;

Do people say "" we need more women who are the Michelle Obama types and less the Kim Kardashian types""?

&amp;#x200B;

People need to see gay people as being every day normal people who range from punk to boring, from smart to idiotic, from talented to homeless. Gay people are just people. That's what we're fighting for. We're not fighting to be a model minority. We are fighting to be just a standard part of the tapestry."
"Download grindr and put on your profile that you‚Äôre straight and looking to experiment.

Sit back and watch the messages flood in*



*presuming you‚Äôre decent looking"
"On the other hand when a guy says he's open to anything, I ask him out on a date and try to figure out if he wants more than sex."
"Us army, intelligence analyst school,   I was 18, he was 19.  He came out to me.  He asked if I was.  I said no. 
He hung out with me a lot give me back rubs.  He slipped a kiss on my neck.   He told me I really wish I could kiss you right now and I kissed him back.  


Then he‚Äôll let me tear up his booty for about four minutes üòÇüôÑü§£"
"Being gay I would say is a part of you, personality trait, lifestyle choice, I hate when people say that, I‚Äôm the same person I have always been, only difference really is that I prefer cocks and ass to tits and ass. As an American living in Europe its quite confusing as being gay means something everywhere for everywhere. There is no one way to be gay. I too get mistaken for being ‚Äústraight‚Äù especially be it in Italy or New York. The fact is that being gay doesnt mean that you have to subscribe to some particular ethos or live up to a certain ideal that other gays have propogated, being authentic and being comfortable in ones own skin, that is what‚Äôs important."
Awww sweet
"I‚Äôm not sure McConnell will even bring it to the floor. If he doesn‚Äôt, he doesn‚Äôt risk the moderate republicans going on the record with a vote on this."
"Gay agenda needs assholes as well. 





Minorities are people. 


People can be assholes sometimes. 


Minorities can be assholes sometimes. 




Being on our best behaviour out of fear of how the community is perceived is a sign of tolerance not acceptance."
"I think we all need to realize that the average penis size is 5 inches, 4.7 is pretty close to average so you should never feel bad about it."
That's getting everything done at once!
"Then it‚Äôs glazed chocolate, not chocolate glaze"
"That is sooo illegal no matter where you live. If it is safe in your country to do so, report it to the police and press charges. You are probably not the only person he has done this to. If you dont want anyone finding out, don't press charges but still have the police intimidate him!"
"I'm tired of people thinking the most extreme members of a group are somehow representative of the whole group. 

James Charles isn't ""the gay agenda"" just like Donald Trump isn't ""America""."
"Does anyone remember the 2005 firestorm around an episode of Postcards From Buster (an Arthur spinoff) where Buster visits a family in Vermont and the parents happen to be lesbian?

PBS pulled the episode ahead of release after the Department of Education demanded they return any federal funding used to produce the episode. Some stations aired it super late at night but had to get it directly from WGBH (who produced the episode) since PBS wouldn't distribute it.

It gives this episode an extra level of significance where we can go from not even being able to mention lesbian parents in passing on an episode mostly about maple syrup to 14 years later being able to air an entire episode about gay marriage."
Omg Notre Dame!
Like every night before I go to sleep üòû
F#cking hot..seriously?
"Health care/insurance in the United States is an absolute mess. I'm lucky enough to have health insurance through my company and I'm still trying to fight an $8,000 claim. We're so lucky to have people like AOC fight for the people instead of for a profit."
"For the record, out of 181 Republican votes, 173 voted against the equality bill.  Only 8 Republicans voted in favor  As always, the vast majority of the Republican Party wants to keep you a second class citizen. 5% of House Republicans voted for the bill.

I thought the whole idea of LGBTQ+ was to be yourself and didn‚Äôt judge others.
"I just came out to my roommates Ray the other day, [this is](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41db7ac07081fab330e110bc026574d5/tumblr_ownecaqkd91w44agko1_r1_400.gif) a pic of his face."
Wow that made me realise how bad the situation is. Jesus thanks dude
"No the guy that answered the door was actually confused and it seemed like he was in the middle of doing something. He had no idea who I was, at least that's what it felt like."
Idk why this was so funny to me but tbh it might work.
"IMO cuddling is better than sex. I mean, cuddling after sex is the best of both worlds. But if I had to choose one or the other, I think I‚Äôd choose cuddling to sleep with someone I really care about and cares about me"
"It is kinda odd but if you're both adults and cool with it....go, have fun.

Other people's opinions are their problem. Not yours."
And they say romance is dead
"\*record scratch\* \*freeze frame\*

Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation."
"Please PM me. I also come from a Muslim family, and people like us don‚Äôt exactly have the luxury of coming out and being accepted in the way that westerners do. I‚Äôm so sorry that you have to deal with this, but I want you to hang in there. I remember when I was 16 and every day felt like a year until I finally became 18. Just know there are others out you who have experienced a similar situation and have come out stronger than ever!"
I will take this story over another 15 year old talking about falling in love with his straight best friend.
"Yes, it‚Äôs normal. But here‚Äôs where you have to buckle down and pass your exams so you can then go off to university and have freedom. Keep your eye on the prize."
"In theory. In practice this sub is full of contradictions. 

But it goes both ways.

People get bashed for simply having preferences of ‚Äúmasc‚Äù men, because it‚Äôs discriminatory. But they are entitled to preference. Even if it might hurt others.

Then fems get bashed for being fem, when it‚Äôs probably a scientific occurrence in reality. Like there are subtle behaviors people pick up on which tells them: this guy is gay, even traditionally ‚Äúmasc‚Äù men. Why? And some of this might be a subscription to cultural stereotyping, but there is some super feminine gay guy who grew up in a rural area with 3 brothers who played football, without another gay in sight. Why does this occur? I‚Äôm convinced that there are patterns of behavior and demeanor that are scientifically based. It‚Äôs not exclusive. But trends mean things. 

There is also some corn fed white dude who loves guns and tractors who is into dudes. And he detached himself from the ‚Äúgay community‚Äù. detaching yourself from the community is seen as abandonment, and homophobia. But if you don‚Äôt identify with a lot of these stereotypes or even ‚Äúscientific occurrences‚Äù (as previously referenced because you are a statistical anomaly or an outlier), and it makes you happy, who are we to judge? It might not be fair that you benefit from a fight you didn‚Äôt take place in, but it‚Äôs their choice. And that‚Äôs what this movement is all about. 

It‚Äôs ironic that we applaud the fluidity of sexuality, yet insist on labels. 

Bisexuals get bashed. People insist on people being gay here. 

But objectively, if a ‚Äústraight guy‚Äù is curious and experiments, and decides he doesn‚Äôt like guys. What is he? 

People here complain about being labeled, then label everyone in return. This entire sub is a clusterfuck of people pushing what they think ‚Äúgay‚Äù should mean."
I like hairy anything
"Sweet, best to you both."
Why don‚Äôt all these lonely guys who‚Äôve upvoted  come together and cuddle each other
"100%. I remember this drunk night with a guy I was on and off again talking to. We get into bed, I lay on my side and he literally backs up right into me... I put my arm up over him and he grabs 
my hand and wraps it tight around his chest before he K.Os. Best fucking feeling ever. We slept good."
This would probably be a whole chapter in my autobiography.
If that makes you weak then I'm happy to say I'm weak as fuck too!
"Hey Twinks for Trump, how's your God Emperor looking these days?"
Plot twist your dad is on Grindr.
I mean straight guys and their dads go to strip climbs together so...I don‚Äôt see the issue here.
I'm so sorry for your loss. Animals are really something special. ‚ù§Ô∏è
It would be a disaster. Bitter angry people will spam one star reviews if they feel spurned by someone.
Got my apartment now. But I did... a handful of times. Even had my brother cover for me sometimes too. To this day my Mom doesn‚Äôt know. It only works if your rents have a consistent work schedule...and you‚Äôre off üòÇ
"Don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs normal sometimes. Doctors and nurses are used to seeing people naked all the time. Even if you get aroused it‚Äôs not a big thing for them, it‚Äôs part of their job attending patience under any circumstances. Now, if it makes you really uncomfortable try to find the reason why that occurs. Is it the doctor itself? Is it just your anxiety playing against you? Try focusing on that the next time."
Modern problems require modern solutions
This post is terrible. Let people be who they are and stop trying to make them fit a mold. That'd be boring as duck.
"False, just ask james charles."
Probably white and blonde
"Thick, hairy legs are the best. THE BEST!"

"It is not your fault one bit!!! As someone who has had a heart attack, it has nothing to do with you. It was caused by poor diet, exercise, genetics, etc. This would have happened even if you weren't there. Don't let family members bully you over this. Good luck."
Every homophobic person should post on this sub!!! We'll change their mind with our gaybros power üòò
I'm trying to figure out why you posted this story
"Please NEVER suggest that anyone, including yourself, use suicide as a means of escaping. That absolutely will not help you in any way.

I hate to say it but you might just have to play along and say you were cured. Get through therapy as best as you can, get a job, and find a way out. Seek asylum in other countries if possible."
"The GOP controlled senate seems to get off on refusing to even bring bills to a vote so I don't see this pressuring anyone.

Keep in mind only 4% of the House GOP voted for the bill. The GOP is simply uninterested in legislating any sort of LGBT protections.

Cue the butthurt turbonerds from the rightwingLGBT safespace coming to gaslight everyone about how the GOP is actually the most pro-LGBT party across the entire world or something."
Sounds like a true gentleman. We should always treat each other respectfully üòä
"There was a spinoff show called Postcards from Buster that once tried to feature a lesbian couple (in like early 2000s I think), but I remember there being protests and it wasn't aired."
I thought his dad was meeting someone from grinder. Was wondering why he chose his sons house out of all places to meet up
"Looking in this thread, I feel more secure now with my hairy body. Thanks guys!"
in b4 threesome
Tell her she‚Äôs basically right.
In the mens locker room at the swimming pool. I'd see bare naked men walking around or showering with their penises gently flopping around. I was shocked by how big their penises were and how they were all surrounded by thick dark pubic hair. I was mesmerized. It was mostly just curiosity but I was definitely attracted as well... although I didn't really understand it.
Exactly.
"By that stat, 95% of ugly guys are straight. You know it's true."
Had a conversation with a homeless man in an elevator last week so ya not really single here
"These are the type of encounters I've preferred.... if the chemistry is there. The whole run and gun mentality only works for me in my profession. 

Stay and cuddle, play a board game and have wine. Only ever at my place though so I guess that's telling."
It's prostitution. Whether or not it's immoral is up to you.
"Alright, bring the downvotes...

ffs James is 19.  Do you all remember how horny you were at 19?  

In the not so recent past, **every** guy (me included) was ""straight"" except that one random guy like James who was out and proud, that got mercilessly picked on in high school.  But then, we just ""messed around"" or whatever... suck my dick bro, no homo.  smh.

Now let's talk about that complete fucking hypocrite Jeffree Star (whose tattoos are bad and whose personality is worse).  Fucking grown ass man bullying a teenager, calling him a ""danger to society"" (have you seen James?  He's literally only dangerous to a makeup cabinet, or drawer, or wherever the hell you keep makeup). 

Not only does he have recordings of him (at age 23) sexually assaulting an ACTUAL straight guy (read: not someone who was curious or questioning) but he tries to put a knife in 19 year old kiddo's (James's) back while he's already going down, after some grown ass woman (Tati or whatever her name is) starts a bitch fit over the fact that she wants to promote scam vitamins? 

Come on... This whole thing is beneath contempt. 

James needs to grow up, obvs., but doesn't every 19 year old idiot? 

Tati needs to put the big girl pants on and stop being a fucking drama queen.

Jeffree Starr needs to be fuck right off.

Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. 

Please..."
they're clearly not both on good terms if his brother is doing this to you. i would tell your boyfriend what happened and show him the messages. then go from there.
4.7 isn't even that small. also thickness is far more of a factor than length though
I tell people straight up (lol) that I'm gay and cannot donate blood in the U.S.
"nothing hotter than touching a pan on a stove, thinking it was cold!"
"they didn't know she was his sister until the wedding, where it's revealed she's the officiator and related to ratburn, lol"
To a Grindr hookup with a guy way older that me. I should‚Äôve waited but I didn‚Äôt sadly.
"I honestly think its just like the mixed thrill/terror of being naked in front of another person, and then also add to that, the fact that the other person/people is/are fully clothed the entore time so it almost feels like im on display"
"In my times, it wasn't like that. There's been this great invention called tumblr.

But then the fire nation attacked."
"To a beautiful spanish guy I talked to on grindr last year while I was on vacations in Barcelona. 

No regrets."
can you travel alone if you are under 18?
"He won‚Äôt. It also risks sending to to trump to veto, which destroy the ~~delusion~~ ~~facade~~ belief Trump is moderate in LGBT issues"
"ya im 4'3"" 60lb and my bf is 9'6"" 560lb so sometimes if he needs to reach nuts or fruit in a tall tree he throws me into the branches to collect it"
Straight women care a LOT about height
"Hey, people talk about the first time like it's supposed to be legendary, but first time sex is usually awful and awkward.

Let your special sex be decided by who you're with and how it makes you feel, not what order it came in.

"Personally I prefer ‚ÄúWEST VIRGINIA!!! MOUNTAIN MAMAAAAA, COUNTRY ROADS!!!‚Äù"
I didn‚Äôt cuz I‚Äôm 16
bold of you to imply I have any friends
"It happened to me once as well. I was chatting with this guy several times over a few days. when then found a good time to meet, he sends me his address and when I got there I messaged him and he just blocked me. Waste of time ... I am not sure where they get off treating guys like this ..."
"Yes, ‚Äúa French crescent-shaped sweet roll eaten for breakfast.‚Äù"
Same! Except I'm pretty hairy above the waist too. I like the fact that I attract naturally smooth guys because they're the ones who get an instant rise out of me. There's something truly erotic about the dynamic.
"Non-dominant, got used to it because I needed the dominant hand for my mouse, lol."
*claps in Spanish*
"Report the profile to Instagram, I think they can block the content from being uploaded to their sites in the future after they take the post down. And call the police, I assume if he filmed you hooked up at his place and can give them an address."
"You can breath more freely and I personally think dicks taste better than vaginas, *way* better."
‚ÄúHis family aren‚Äôt racist they just haven‚Äôt met any people of colour they liked‚Äù
Cute dicks.
"That is just so utterly beautiful and sweet! Loveliest post of the month, easy"
"Yup, rugby kits are so f#cking sexy to me now."
What if you're black
I'm sorry but what have I ever done to you to be called out like this?
"At first I thought both boys and girls were cute. The truth didn‚Äôt dawn on me until I saw that late night softcore ‚Äúporn‚Äù on Cinemax. I was sooooo frustrated that they never showed the dude‚Äôs dick. I reasoned at the time that the producers didn‚Äôt think anyone would be interested. Well I WAS DAMMIT

But now there‚Äôs the internet, so, y‚Äôknow, I scratched that itch more than once since then."
"These kind of hookups are great and I love having them. However, they leave me feeling lonely cause it was just a hookup and nothing more. It‚Äôs so nice to cuddle and fall asleep together. Then the next day I‚Äôm all alone. The struggle üò≠"
Will guys be chill about me looking to receive and see if I‚Äôm comfortable without reciprocating?
"I'm pretty flexible and I definitely wouldn't kick a leaner/muscled guy out of my bed, but I like my guys ""softer""/less defined. The guy in the picture has a great body. Ideal for me would be like him, but a bit thicker. 

I fucking love nuzzling all up in a soft, furry belly."
"Just remember in British slang, the fanny is in the front. In American slang, the fanny is in the back."
Empathy
"This person has decided that he is willing to risk a bacterial STI because the pleasure he experiences during bareback sex is worth it to him. You prefer to use condoms because you like the peace of mind they give you.

You are allowed to have your dealbreakers around safer-sex practices. So is he. Neither one of you is willing to compromise; so you two are not a match.

This is only a problem if you feel entitled to impose your choices on other people."
Btw I don't know what is preventing me doing it. I used to say I would never come out and hide everything but fuck that. I wanna live and love.
"I've had sex with curious or desperate straight guys before, and it really isn't that exciting of an experience."
"Yup. Also I've been with beautiful boys and whose personality initally fitted with my interest but it went downhill because they turned out to be assholes, so I don't even care about my own preferences anymore, I just want someone that will make me feel loved and comfortable"
"Won‚Äôt someone think of the anthropomorphic animal children! 

/s"
Exactly this. I see so many straight boys ecstatic to jump on this hate wagon using the same repurposed homophobic jokes from their middle school years.
"Op, a bit of advice so you don't get taken advantage of. Morality aside, if you do decide to accept, make sure you:

# Stay safe and use protection. Go on Prep if you aren't already, as another safeguard.
# Know and enforce your limits.
# Get tested two weeks after and as recommended by your GP thereafter.
# Remember that this is prostitution. Get the money beforehand and not after."
28 with someone I'd loved for a long time. In a church but that's just a random fact. 2 year relationship but it crashed and burned.
"I absolutely love the size difference between me and my boyfriend. I'm 158 cm tall and weigh 49 kg, so I'm quite skinny, and I prefer to bottom. My boyfriend is 186 cm tall and weigh 83 kg and he's exclusively a top. He plays sports and goes to the gym often, and he takes good care of his diet, so he's nice and muscular. 

Outside of the bedroom, just standing next to him makes me feel safe and protected and looked after, even in the dead of night in the dangerous aftermath of nightlife. His mere presence is enough to announce to others that I'm taken and that I'm his. When we get caught in the rain outside, if I cuddle close enough to him in the right position, his much bigger size is enough to shield me from the elements. No need an umbrella when I have him. 

In the bedroom, his much bigger size and strength makes it so much easier for him to dominate me. He can lift me up with ease, throw me around, physically manipulate me, and very effectively pin me down and restrain me with his own muscular strength. The large shadows his broad shoulders casts over my smaller frame just before he devours me just feels so right and reminds me of my lesser position. 

I admit that video of the smaller guy topping the bigger muscular guy is really hot, but I'll never be able to try that with my boyfriend, because he's an exclusive top and dominant. My boyfriend has commented that he appreciates my size because it makes it easier for him to assert himself, which he enjoys doing. However, in his most tender moments, such as when he's cuddling me and whispering sweet things into my ear, I am reminded that I'm not just his, but he's also mine, and the thought of having that hunky man in all his strength and power at my disposal is lovely. 

So yeah... I think size differences between two guys are hot."
"Last year of high school, early 90‚Äôs. I was on the starting string of our high school football team,  not because I had any real athletic ability, I was just big and could run pretty fast for a fat kid. 

I went to a super poor high school in the Midwest and we frequently had to make due with substandard equipment. Instead of a hot tub we had giant metal animal drinking trough with a 10 hp Johnson outboard motor inside. Someone had graciously welded a metal screen on a third of the tank to prevent losing any toes, but the danger was real.  The tank held two people, who had to cram into the non toe mangling side big spoon / little spoon style.   

Coach had rules for Franken-tub.  You had to use the tub if you got hurt in practice.  The water was 108 degrees. You had to stay for an hour.  You went in bare ass.  You had to double up.

Late July, football practice began, in a series of morning and evening work outs known as two-a-days. The schedule amounted to a grueling 8 hours of practice interspaced with naps and lunch. The evening hours were reserved for weight lifting.

Coach‚Äôs schedule always included squats and deadlifts.  I was the team leader for heaviest 5 rep set of squats, at 405.  Out star running back was the leader of deadlifts at 495. 

I pulled my hamstring while trying to squat 415. I tried to walk it off but coach saw me and banished me to Franken-tub. A short while later, star running back ‚Äúpulled‚Äù a muscle too, except he was quicker to the locker room than me. 

When I got to the locker room, star running back was in the big spoon position.  I crawled into little spoon position, and we waited for our hour. 

Thirty minutes in, everyone has showered and left, even Coach.  I‚Äôm sitting in the little spoon position with the biggest erection of my life because star running back is basically hugging me and I can feel ever ripple of his toned svelte body. And then, the timer goes off. 

My 18 year old brain thinks I can just stand up and slide out of this hunk of metal gracefully. I only manage to fall out, hard.  Somehow, my body is able to still manage a rock hard dick.  I scramble to my feet trying to find words to explain.  Before I can mouth the words,  star running back grabs my cock with one hand and pulls me towards the group showers.

His first kiss felt electric all the way down to my toes."
At least this ain‚Äôt like the James Charles situation lol
"This is why I never meet at first contact. I'll say I'm busy but would def like to meet another day. If he's serious he'll chat and be nice. And a few days later I'll message him if he's online and gauge if he's still interested. 

The ones looking to be assholes are ideally look in for a quick victim because they are bored. Also older guys less likely to waste end doing that."
"First time getting blown was with a much older guy. He was about 20yrs older than me and a photographer. He was taking nude artistic photos of me. We were talking one minute, the next he was blowing me. After that time it became a semi regular thing.
      The first time I bottomed, I met a guy in a chat room. We eventually got together at a hotel and had sex for hours, it was awesome."
As long as you have the means to get out of there if you need to I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about it. Just make sure someone knows what you‚Äôre doing.

"I think both are rooted in the belief that the gay stereotype is completely arbitrary, and therefore anyone who conforms to it must have been culturally coerced.

Objectively speaking, being gay (i.e. being sexually attracted to men) should have *nothing* to do with being flamboyant, or femme, or anything else. There's no rational reason to group those concepts together. The fact that we do is a cultural and historical accident. And yet... so many gay men conform to the stereotype. Conclusion? It must be some kind of peer pressure, or self delusion, a fashion trend, a subconscious display of tribal loyalty, etc. *Something* must be influencing their behaviour. Something must have tampered with their core personality.

It's honestly kinda creepy, when you really think about it. It's no wonder a lot of gay guys feel an instinctive need to distance themselves from it."

"Yes and no - people like Pete Buttigieg tilt the public perception of gay people away from stereotypes, and yes, that‚Äôs because they are boring. Because they are palatable.

But that isn‚Äôt always a good thing. Back when Love, Simon came out, the same arguments were made - A big studio was able to make a movie about a gay person because every other aspect of the movie was *palatable*, down to the actor that plays the main character, the middle-class neighbourhood and somewhat predictable plot.

This comes down to a discussion about what benefits the queer community more; palatable and boring for slow changes that are incremental at best, or radical devil-may-care attitudes to force change one way or the other? After all, aren‚Äôt ‚Äòfabulous‚Äô people also valid, and shouldn‚Äôt they get to be represented and accepted, too?

The way I see it, there‚Äôs no right or wrong way to be gay. ‚ÄòFabulous‚Äô people who break through norms like James Charles (minus the being-an-absolute-shit part) and ‚Äòpalatable‚Äô people like Pete Buttigieg who abide by them are both incredibly important for there to be meaningful, positive change.

The actions of a few should in no way be representative of the entire community, whichever way. We‚Äôre not all like Pete, nor are we all like James."

"Same thing happened to one of my friends. When she was a kid, she pulled a pot of boiling water down on herself and ended up with scars in all the same places.

She‚Äôs married now with 3 kids, a great husband and a thriving social life with loads of friends.

Feeling sorry for yourself won‚Äôt make things magically happen. You gotta put yourself out there just like everyone else does. When the right guy comes along, he won‚Äôt see your scars in the same way you do.

Stay positive."
"So in my country we have the term ""Sunday boyfriend"" (well, the boyfriend/girlfriend word is actually gender neutral, but that's another story). I think that entails approximately what happened here. It's basically cuddling, dinner, netflix etc. Sodomy can be included or not. You can have the same sunday boyfriend several times, or you can change them, up to you."

She said have a nice day."

"Happened to me a few years back. I got off the elevator and there were two guys with their backs to me as I walked by. I didn‚Äôt think much about it but when I got to the room and knocked no one answered. These two guys walked towards me but didn‚Äôt make eye contact and just walked by. I‚Äôm 99.9% it was one of them. 

I get back in the car and drive home feeling like an ass when he messages me again saying he‚Äôd been in the shower. I didn‚Äôt believe him at all. Then another guy messages me right then and yelled at me for talking to his boyfriend. 

It was the two guys just totally fucking with me. To this day I don‚Äôt get what possessed them to do that."
The cutest story here
"On the other hand, when you tell your dad you're gay, his response will be "" Yeah rigth """

you might wanna date me

Beautiful
My parents had consistent work schedules but also security cameras outside the house. Not as much as a single unmonitored window...
"Do not confuse yielding with weakness, or force with strength. Real strength lies in the balanced combination between suppleness and power. Part of the work we get to do as gay men is see our strength in owning what we find attractive."
I had a National Geographic when I was a kid with half naked Maori men in it that made me so hard lol. I still think Maori guys are generally so attractive.
Replace ‚Äústraight‚Äù with masculine lol
Damn... all i see are red flags...
Your boyfriend is lying. Hanging out with a guy to make him jealous means you‚Äôre probably a matched set. Enjoy the drama that you both thrive on.
"Feel ya! 
I call it ""I'm afraid he'll reject me because I need love so I just manipulated him, lying, for him to love the fake detached version of me."" feeling.
It comes mixed with ""If I say I want to be loved, he will run and there will be no sex tonight, so I will be smart and keep things open"" feeling.
It all fades when the feeling ""fuck, I started it with the wrong foot"" comes."
"I'm sorry you're going through this. It's not only difficult emotionally, but also incredibly unfair to you. 

Yes. It's time to call it quits. Not only is the emotional trauma of being cheated on bearing on you, but also if hes gay....then hes gay and is also in the wrong relationship (with you.) 

To be clear, what he is doing..is 100% wrong, for both of you. But you dont deserve that. Also, if he IS cheating (which he probably is) I'd be concerned of him using protection or not. I'd be concerned about any potential STDs if I were you. 

Do yourself a favor. Love yourself like you deserve, and walk away. You dont deserve a cheater."
"Oooof, this was me in high school. Jocks in cut off tanks with their hairy pits and legs... that was my ultimate weakness in HS"
"Okay, I've talked about this previously in another subreddit, but your erections and the fact that you're naked, male and in the office is essentially a non-event for them. You may as well be asking if the fact you have eyebrows is upsetting for them. 

You may have an exhibitionism streak - no big deal, some people do. But it's not as big of a problem as it's made out to be. Relax, we're all conditioned to consider nudity to be synonymous with sexuality, and so you subconsciously respond to the mental juxtaposition of yourself in a medical office, nude, as a potential sexual interlude.

Just chill out, and maybe go to a nudist beach or two, and use it as an opportunity to get used to the concept that there's no inherent sexuality implied in nudity. It might help. 

Alternatively, go find a guy equally into exhibitionism and get that particular itch scratched, yeah?"
He already knows. I came out to him 6 years ago. Which is why he also looked a bit confused I guess.
Don't get the hype. Straight guys are boring because nothing is ever going to happen and if it does its going to be one sided and lame.
"It's just how they naturally end up playing out a lot of the time. Like maybe he knows I'm coming straight from work and offers to make something to eat. Or we have sex and then just end up spending a an hour or three laying in bed talking and cuddling.

I also see profiles that go into detail like ""I particularly enjoy spending whole evenings in bed together with lots of making out and body contact"".

What I'm saying is the concept of the ""boyfriend experience"" isn't as clearly defined and widely understood as say something like a ""blow-and-go"".

Obviously a lot of guys don't think this kind of hook-up even happens--let alone that it's something that they can ask for. It's just rarely ever explicitly talked about as it's own thing. They're usually referred to just as ""hook-ups"" which a lot of people assume always means more anonymous/emotionless. This sub seems to have tons of guys who want the ""boyfriend experience"" and therefore decide to not hook-up because they don't realize the ""boyfriend experience"" is actually something that happens.

Agreed on your last point. My best, longest, and most intimate FWBs are the ones who do the raunchiest, kinkiest, and most casual stuff with me. We're comfortable together so there's no hesitation to ask to do the dirty stuff that might be off-putting to a new guy."
And gay men are way more into big muscles.
"He was closeted, he wanted to marry  have kids etc. we are in a pretty conservative country, and his family was extremely conservative as well, no one knew his sexuality (i was/am open if it matters) he basically wanted to marry a woman and still be with me, I was not okay with that, because it would be unfair to both me and his future wife. We decided to stay friends, but we basically ghosted each other because, atleast for me, it was easier not to see him."
"I was watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in theaters, and I remember randomly thinking ‚ÄúHuh.
