What part of America is that? ^^/^^s
DO NOT LIE. That's a terrible idea. If you don't want to quit then just be honest and then it's up to them
"That's kind of a non-answer. I think OP obviously is aware of that, but is trying to get a gut-check of what a realistic level should be for her. My standards can be Emilia Clarke or bust, but that doesn't mean they should be. OP is asking a legitimate question that deserves more than a rhetorical answer like this.

"If you get rejected, you didn't lose anything. You are literally back to where you're at before asking whatever question you asked.

You had all to gain from asking them, and pretty much nothing to lose.

That's my mindset anyways. Also I ask early on so there's less pressure built up. As well I find it weaselish to pretend to be friends with someone in the hopes of becoming more.

Other than that, you should have your own life going on already, so keep trucking on as usual. Might sting a bit, but things will be normal again soon after."
All the god damn time
Had sex with a girl who was quiet and just laid there like a starfish. 
"Very abusive dad who pointed a gun at my head when he was drunk, thinking it was loaded pulled the trigger. It’s this account’s first post if you wanna read more about it."
"i'm not crying, you are crying. Honestly though, as a father, this wrecks me. My biggest fear is I wont be there for my kids as they grow up. "
"Full stop, I won't date someone that smokes and I CERTAINLY wouldn't date someone that lied to me about their smoking when I eventually found out about it."
We use to call those [Dependapotamus](http://nextgenmilspouse.com/is-there-truth-behind-the-dependapotamus-myth/)
You missed the chance for comparison. 
"I had a similar occurance once at a friends dinner party. After shaking hands with a guest I hadn't met before, they loudly proclaimed that I had soft hands. This lead to a round of everyone in attendance getting up and jostling eachother to feel my hands.

I didnt have the heart to tell them that no, I don't moisturize. I just beat it pretty often.

Anyway, what is a buffalo bill situation?"
Well now you gotta marry her

"Men are not constantly horny, sometimes we just want to sleep."
"I would never date anyone who smoked, regardless of what they were smoking, and if they had that from me knowing I wouldn't be okay with it, then there'd be a pretty damn substantial issue when I found out."
"Do: the dreamer wants to have sex with me in real life.

Don't: the dream does not want to have sex with me in real life."
She had stanky genitals. So I shut it down and wiped off my weapon and went on my way...

"Exactly, I don’t get the hate I’m getting. Clearly she was crossing a line without even warning me what I was about to get myself into lol. If she warned me ahead of time I likely would have at least stayed the whole night "

"I am that person who hates smoking.
Smells disgusting, sticks with the smoker for a lot longer than they think it seems, kills you, among other things."
"Library, it's almost next door and it has deck chairs on the roof."
"Sitting in a comfortable chair, reading or doing nothing for a few hours sounds like a mighty fine time to me. Meanwhile, the GF cannot sit still for 5 minutes. Gotta watch TV, play games on her iPad, text multiple group chats and talk about work at the same time."

As a 31 year old single man it is damn near impossible finding anyone in my age bracket who is both single and childless (in New Zealand at least). I can see how a lot of guys would just bite the bullet.
"Only when you see a girl pass by that all of you look at, or if they ask about your gf. That’s about it I think. Also sharing crazy chick stories."
"Except it obviously happens at random moments and only tells you some odd fact about a person, like he's a Vols fan."
"I have PCOS and have recently been losing weight on the keto diet. It was hard at first but I am getting more and more used to the diet. -10lbs so far for me in about 2 months, whereas NOTHING was working before."
"I hate smoking, if you smoke I will not date you. If you hide it I will eventually find out, probably sooner than later since you will smell of it. Then not only are you a smoker but a lying sack of shit."
"When I realized how consciously selfish she was.

Or maybe when I realized how often I'd desire other women who weren't her. Something that has never happened in my previous relationships."
"I have 3 Ex's that I would regard past serious relationships, but who broke-off on good terms and who immediately went on to date and marry someone else a short time later. Fast forward a few years and 2 are already separated/divorced. The third is early days, only wish the best, but don't see it lasting either.

I am long over them but in these social media times, I find it interesting to learn what became of people who were once a big part of my life."

"2-4 depending on free time and annoyance of task. I can do most things, but I'm not spending my whole weekend on something to avoid the mechanic, nor am I going to have my main vehicle out of commission for a week to fit it into my free time.

On the other hand, my motorcycle has never seen a mechanic other than me. That can wait a month if I'm busy."
I'm going to look at your post history now. . .
"ya that happened to me one time in college with a friend I had hung out with freshman year....we're facebook friends but if one of us where to like either mine or his status, we'll most likely revert back to that stupid party.

"I realize that the worst anyone can tell me is ""No"".

I'll recommend it.  Weed took me from 3 hours of sleep to 7 hours of sleep.  Edibles work better for me than flower or dabs.
"Only to get a general idea of their interests, to figure out if mine mends with hers. Majority just skimming, anything more is weird"

I was wondering if you were South African cause they're the only people I've heard use that haha
"Have to agree, I think it's called just being a horny bugger, lol.
I found the same thing with clothes too, like ""fuck tight jeans are so hot"" and ""fuck short shorts are hot"" and ""damn it's hot when I girl wears casual sweatpants"" and I realised it's probably just that I like everything"
"My smell. This means how my breath smells, my hair, my clothes, my armpits. Fucking anything. I brush my teeth twice a day simply for the clean smell. I shower twice a day to make sure I’m clean. My clothes stay in the laundry closet so they smell like fresh laundry at all times. Any time people’s smells are brought up I’m always told I smell like clean clothes and it’s probably the best compliment I can get because it takes my anxiety down 5 notches. "
"Exactly! I saw a few comments saying how girls tend to lose interest once you mention anything ""geeky"". You probably wouldn't hang out with a dude with whom you have no common interests, so why would you want to date someone like that?"
"All I can say is, hopefully the answer doesn’t involve prison. "
"I rarely do this, but when I do, I have a very specific data point I am interested in. Where did they work at some year, are they connected to a specific person, did they attend a particular school? Or pictures. A picture often says more than 1000 words."
"If she had read me she would have known how to hit on me. Did the linguistic math in my head and I think I have negated it often enough to say that. But hey be kind... Me is not native English man, me foreign.

Well, I laughed so I must have passed the test, I guess? Perhaps I was put on one more government watch list or something."
Cigarettes is an immediate turn off. Weed I don't really care about.
"Kinda funny how that works huh? Some friends and I were talking about this like 2-3 weeks ago. All of us really enjoy cunnilingus and do it any chance we get yet every girl we have ever dated are always ""mildly willing at best"" to give blowjobs like once or twice a month. 

I can't even remember last time I got a blowjob to completion. Usually they're half-assed and then she stops halfway through and wants to start fucking."
My _ex_ (as of last night) fell asleep as soon as the tv turned on. Gotta say I don't think I'll be missing that about her.

Agree with this.  
"i was playing this psychological horror game called doki doki literature club while high, im a kissless virgin and i got to the part where the neighbor girl says she wants to spend the rest of her life with the guy and it made me sad. also she was depressed and it was a very realistic depiction of depression and i could relate to parts of it. the first half of that game is really good but the second half is pretty much shit because it turns out she wasnt actually depressed because she was being controlled by magic, really lame."

"My gynocomastia. Kicked in when I hit puberty many moons ago. Even when I was muscled up and cut, I still had “bitch tits” so it’s not from weight. Apparently it’s a hormone imbalance. I’ve been on testosterone injections, Androgel, etc to try to bring my T-levels up and balance shit out but it’s just not in the cards. I know surgery is an option but I’m not one to go under the knife for something so vain. 

Luckily, the woman I married couldn’t care less and for the most part I don’t seem to care much myself anymore. But you’ll never catch me shirtless out in public. "
Had quiet sex with my wife with my mother sleeping in another room. 
"Depends on how you talk about the women tbh.

I talk about relationships and ask for advice all the time with women. I'll save my one night stand stories for my close friends, but only if it is a worthy story. Not that this happens a lot lol. Just be respectful about how you talk about women and honestly there shouldn't be a problem. 

Just like anything in life, relationships are key, sexual or not, and it always helps to have good judgement around you. Remember though that the final decision of actions should be ones that you are comfortable with because that is who you are. "
"Shit, sorry, wasn't supposed to reveal the fact that all Democrats get together for orgies..."
"4 by your metric. I did a head gasket, timing belt and skim on my last Land Rover, done a lot of my own brakes, suspension and servicing. Did the gearbox and clutch on my current one but I had help from a mate who's a master tech. Just don't have the time these days, as fun as it can be. So I give to a trusted specialist if the work is urgent."
Used to be a 5; now a 3.5.  That’s what she said.
"Honestly the best way to cope with it is to get rejected more. You realize how big of a deal it isn't and so you care less about it in the future. Every guy ever gets rejected at some point.

Remember, if you're getting rejected often, it means you're putting yourself out there more. That's a good thing. Shooters shoot.

If it gets to be a lot after a while and your self-confidence is taking a hit, just take a little time off for yourself. It's okay. Go for a long run or grab a beer with a friend. "

you're not gonna end up with a happy relationship if you don't see her views as just as valid as your own
"If you think you're coming across as a fuckboy or shallow, just step back and ask if something you said made you come across as one. If the people you talk with are reasonable people, they'll tell you and you can adjust from there."
"so you wouldn't even put up with someone who smokes like 3 cigarettes per week? I like smoking after lunch occasionally, but from what I understand, some people are really against smoking cigarettes. "
"Jealousy.  This is very fortunate, because I’m one of those odd men who doesn’t have many male friends, so I interact with other girls socially more often than many guys.  At this point, we’ve been together for 9.5 years, and she knows me well enough to credit me with not being a cheater.  

In fact, hilariously enough, an old friend of mine that I briefly went FWB with before I met my then-girlfriend was still my friend when we got together, and they actually took a shine to each other - now her family and ours are great friends, and the fact that we banged a couple times in the past is ancient history to all 3 of us.  *That’s* how not-jealous my wife is."

"Ehh maybe 3 but I don't bother with my oil but I change my own fan belt and whatever else is easily accessible so any filters, pulleys, alternator, battery.... you get the point. I installed a CAI and new throttle body in my mustang along with a few other cosmetics without taking it to a shop. 

Both my work truck and my car are kinda high on mileage so I'm trying to stay on top of everything especially my truck."
It's all in present tense except the second sentence.
Oh dang
It is what it is. Made me stronger and give me expectations of what I will tolerate and not tolerate IF I get into another relationship. Which I'm not rushing to get into no time soon.
"Friend of a friend in a discord lobby while everyone else was AFK:


Guy: stop touching my dick

Guy's GF: but I want to

Guy: I'm trying to play video games 

GF: I don't care I want some dick. Come to bed now. 

Guy: (joking but only a little)no go away 

At this point I laughed a little and she could apparently hear me through his speakers

GF: who are you talking to? 

Guy: nicsaweiner

GF: well nicsaweiner, he doesn't want to have sex as often as I do. I told him that I wanted to have an open relationship and fuck other guys and he cried himself to sleep like a little bitch. 

Me: uhhhhhh..."
"You could say that. It's just part of life. Partners, jobs, schools, banks, bouncers, etc.. will reject you. Don't be an ass about it and move on. "
"That would make it even more awkward.

On the other hand, I wouldn't assume someone who could read me well enough to guess my humour wouldn't hit on me in a way that I could respond to."

"Sorry to hear this. I had a ex who did the same. Almost 3 yrs.  Mentally, emotionally abusive. BPD disorder. I loved (past tense) this cunt with my whole soul. Didn't make enough at my job, even though she quit hers and I was supporting us both for month. I paid rent with my hard earned but little cash while she paid rent with money her parents gave her monthly and spent ballot of the money in weed. She broke up with me out of blue, and ended up seeing her guy friend (who actually came to our house a couple time before as one of her ""friends""). Pretty sure she fucked around during our relationship but it's over and done with.  And the thing she had with her guy friend. That seemed to fizzle out in no time. She's basically hanging with her whore friends now and being a slut. It is what it is. I see her for who she really is now and will never even give her the time of day of I see her again. "
"I don’t know what kind of women you know, but yes it’s completely true. That said, do I make lighthearted complaints about my husband — for example, do I poke fun at his need to DVR every single show on earth? Sure. Does he make fun of me for being late to everything. Sure. But are the comments ever nasty or demeaning? Absolutely not. First of all, you have enough respect and love for your partner not to belittle them. And more practically speaking, you wouldn’t want to put your friends in an awkward situation anyway. "
Kids get free stuff all the time
I was dreaming that I was among thousands of people who were crying. Their sadness was so incredibly overwhelming. It was like the sadness felt at a funeral but thousands times the sadness. I began crying loudly in my sleep. I woke up crying and cried at least fifteen minutes after. I'll never forget that sadness for as long as I live. 
Smoking is my only real deal breaker. Any smoking at all would kill my interest.

So we meet at a (totally empty) bar and he texts his guy.  The whole time we're discussing the show we met at and he's showing me and the bartender his collection of crystals.  now he needs the money to run outside and leaves the crystals as ""insurance"".  I ended up grabbing the crystals and booking it two blocks down all the while keeping an eye on the corner to see if he would come back (or if it was a set up and cops were rushing in).

"I'll just let them see. I don't care what they think. I got my own shit to take care of and think about. But to avoid confrontation, or the fucking cold having my tears freeze to ice on my face I stay indoors. I just now rest on the floor, crying a bit as I stared into the ceiling. It happens.

I don't suppress them at all. I allow myself to feel the feelings I have. The only restraint I have is how my body sometimes reacts as a result of being sad. Self-control as a man is very important, but one shouldn't stop oneself from feeling feelings. If women think it's weak for a man to cry then that's on them. I don't give a shit and I cry whenever the fuck I feel like it's a good time for it. No one will stop me."
"I felt slightly sad, lots of memories in that car. I got a much better and newer one though and the second I sat in the new car with the knowledge that it's mine, all love for my old car vanished. Much like moving on from an ex. "

"I gave my first truck to my grandma, it was supposed to just sit in her back yard most of the time and be mainly for going to the dump. The rest of my family wasn't supposed to touch it(this was specifically part of the agreement because they absolutely destroy cars). About a year later I went to visit and found out my uncle used the truck a lot, trashed it and they parted it out and got rid of it. 

I was fucking livid. I have never had an argument with my family even remotely close to that in my life. "

"Right, they know what they like. They dont know what other fish like. Thats my point.

"This has always been difficult for me to adequately explain.

I want cuddles, yes. I also want sex. Truth be told, I'd be happier if the cuddling were to transition to sex. However, even if sex doesn't happen, I still crave the cuddling itself. Feeling your body against someone else's is this wholesome, healing, soothing experience. I'm not into cuddling for sexual reasons; I don't cuddle just because I want to have sex. Cuddling isn't something I ""put up with"" for sex, and it's not something I'm ""settling for"" if sex doesn't happen. I thoroughly enjoying cuddling, in and of itself.

It's just also that, if I enjoy cuddling with you, then I also really want to be fucking you."

"This is my primary concern with going to therapy. I'm one of the most introverted people I know. And by introverted I don't mean I lack social skills, I just prefer my own company most of the time. I can go weeks without seeing friends if I want, and when we do hang out it's more a ""go out for lunch and catch up"" kind of situation. Maybe play some board games or something. So I rarely meet new people. All that being said I've been using online dating since before tinder even existed, and in the 6+ years I've been doing it I got 1 date. At this point it definitely feels like ""Why bother? Clearly Nobody is interested. I guess I'm defective somehow.""  Which seems like where therapy may be able to help. But to my mind the root cause is 30 years without any real interest from women since I remember not feeling this way."

Checked social media, her and her friend had blocked me on everything. They blocked my roommate too. No idea what we did, honestly the night all four of us had was amazing. Together for partying and separate for hooking up. "

"At the time, I wasn’t upset because I sold my first truck for a different truck that I had always wanted

But close to 20 years later...I can tell you with absolute certainty that if I won the lotto today...tomorrow I would be looking into getting the same make and model of my first truck so I could restore it to a perfect replica of my first

It wasn’t my dream truck when I was a kid.  It was old, the ac didnt work well, it was slow, and it didnt have any fancy gadgets or gizmos

But I’d give anything to drive it one more time

I still have dreams about that truck

"With my wife, I met her right after my divorce. I was not really looking for a relationship, but I was not opposed to one, either. Looking back at my romantic past, I suppose this was my attitude for most of my life. I really cannot remember thinking, ""I am looking for a relationship.""

Not that I'd like to view my views on the issues in the first place, especially at work.

"Dear God, yes! It was a 1997 Subaru Impreza. I learned stick in that thing at 16, and drove it all over the country at various times over a 10 year span. It had no cruise control, and it seemed like more and more electronics were breaking as time went on, but I loved that thing so much.

"You guys writing my biography or something?

During a visit down south to see my few remaining friends, my best friends' wife mentioned that she knew someone who might like to meet me - she'd been through a lot, and could do with the company of someone ""nice and genuine"", I think her words were.  She gave me her number.  In a rare moment of bravery I sent a text saying who I was, and she rang me back.  I only had 24 hours before I returned to Scotland and the girl said she had a salivary gland infection (nice!) but I was welcome round hers to say hello anyway.  I went round that evening and despite her looking like Don Vito Corleone, we hit it off straight away.

We started talking after I went back to Scotland - mostly by postal letter, but sometimes by very long phonecalls.  I could just about get a reception on my mobile phone if I stood on a chair in the corner of my bedroom in the forest, so I spent hours in this weird position having the most amazing conversations.  In a further act of bravery, she came up to visit me two months later and stayed for the weekend and we had the most incredible time of our lives - we stayed up all night talking, dancing, laughing, drinking, playing the guitar and singing together.  By the end of the weekend, we knew we were made for each other.  Within another three months I had sold almost everything I owned and moved back down south.  Crashed in my brother's spare room for a while and looked for work, before we moved in together.  This about seven years ago, and we got married in 2017."

Depends on the drinks. Straight shots is probably like 8. Mixed drinks I’d say like 12-15. Beer 10-20 depending on the pace of the night and what drinking games are happening.

"I really dislike posts like these just because they start to force out some of my insecurities. I'm 27, average looking, and I've never even kissed a girl before, much less had a girlfriend. I don't know, I guess I just don't have the natural characteristics physically and personality wise to have that natural magnetic attraction. I mean don't me wrong, I can see why. I am very introverted and quiet most of the time, and I dislike social interaction so naturally I have armor up almost all of the time in public situations, so I mainly blame myself for this. 

Still, it is disheartening to be so late in my 20s and have 0 experience in terms of romance or physical affection. 

I'm still holding out hope, but the older I get the more that starts to wear down. And I really don't like the idea of going to bars or other public attraction to fish out potential opportunities for that sort of thing. I kinda want a relationship with a girl who is friend material first as I value that more, and then have that hopefully evolve into something more. Problem being making friends, much less female friends is a difficult endeavor. I don't have a lot of interests and hobbies that would cause me to go out and try and mingle with other people.

I know this is all excuses, but I think this is probably my biggest failing as a person. It is the one hurdle I am most afraid to climb over."

"&gt; A lot of women feel profoundly uncomfortable and disrespected themselves when their s/o watches porn. 

Oh, guys too! I've seen those threads here. Plenty of people are bothered by things that people do, say, or believe that don't impact or concern them. 

Their feelings aren't relevant unless they're impacted. 

Don't like gay marriage? Cool, don't get gay married. STFU otherwise. 
Don't like porn? Don't watch it. No one cares how you feel about anyone else's consumption.

I totally get your point -- a lot of people *feel* really uncomfortable with their SO using porn, dildos, vibrators..having mixed gender friends, a password on their phone.

I just don't think those feelings warrant action on their partner's part.


No level of emotion  means their SO actually has to *do* or change anything, nor does it mean the person experiencing that difficulty gets input just because they have feelings about it.

Sometimes, you have feelings about something, and ain't shit to do but get over it.

If it's something that's having a real-life impact on your relationship, fine. If your SO is watching porn to the extent that they can't have sex with a human being, it's a real-life problem they need to fix.

If you are just insecure or jealous and aren't handling it well, that's a real life problem, but that's yours to work through."
"&gt; Just saying that you don’t seem to have considered her feelings.

I didn't, at all. I didn't feel that her feelings were relevant to how I choose to masturbate, and I felt like she was crossing boundaries trying to tell me, an adult what I'm allowed to watch.

&gt;you chose porn over her, case closed.

No. I chose my right to bodily autonomy over dealing with her insecurity.

She could have tried telling me not to eat scrapple, watch Lifetime movies, or listen to Kenny G CDs and gotten the same result. I detest the *idea* of all of those things and would never consume them, but I'm an adult, and no one decides what I am allowed to consume but me.

If you try and tell me what I'm allowed to consume, I'm going to take it as disrespecting my ability to make my own choices and leave you.

&gt;don’t put it out there if you’re not okay w a response

Spent a lot of great alone time just cruising back roads, finding new places. I’m a family man, and it was one of the things that was truly mine. My wife would ride sometimes with me, but not very often so it was essentially the one thing that was just for me. Now that the accident is in the past and I’m healed as good as I will be, I think about hunting that bike down and trying to reacquire it!"

I know that you have your own situation of life, and i may not understand it, but neither do you know about others, to talk like you know the effort the put on changing things or define if their advise is valid or not.

What I'm trying to make you understand and people who gave the advise is that everybody has its own life, stop caring about others, success is in the eyes of the observer.

Why do you care so much about being a virgin?
And it is not only being a irgin but also you want intimacy?

May be it was easy for lots of people to get laid, and everyone you know got laid, but it isn't easy for you. Try to work on small steps

Would you go out with youself? If not what would you think you need to change that, if you would not go out with yourself then why would someone else do it.
If yes then what are you not looking that may push away the girls that you like or the thing that you are missing?

There is a lot of things to think about, and most of them are self exploratory. Thats why you waste your time comparing with others.

"Yesterday at a funeral. Didn’t know the guy personally. I was there to support my GF, they were friends. He was robbed &amp; shot. He was 24 with a promising future. The screams coming from his mother &amp; fiancé was too much for to hold it back."

"Hey! You remind me of my guy. He said the same stuff when I met him. He works out (strong man workout, he blew up my phone about sqauting 395lbs last night lol). Apparently, he had a crap relationship with a dingbat, dumped her and focused on
1. Working out 
2. Coding (we're both into it) 
3. He focused on himself and stayed single for a long time

You said there aren't any studies, but honestly, what he did (similar to you) did work out. When I met him He was happy, content, knew his standards, and was never a bastard.

He always mentions to me that men need a male role model and to focus on themselves ..because he was always sexual frustrated and had a difficult time.

The interesting factor is i did the same thing except in the female(?) version..(got pissed off, swore off men, enrolled college, bought a wardrobe, worked on my skill set and fucking standards).

Bottom line: 
You're working hard. Other people have tried your method and it works. Be what you want and be relentless in What you desire. It's worked from my POV.

"I wouldn't say society gives us this advice, I'd say it's a circle that will never end unless more people are educated on how greedy others can be. 

It starts with boy taking advantage of girl, or girl taken advantage of boy, girl is left insecure, boy is left hurt, both grow different managing mechanisms which conflict with each other. Girl wants to be reassured she is worth something to someone after being hurt, and Boy wants to never be betrayed so puts up a ""tough"" guy act to deal with it. 

Personally I'd say it's down to parents to help children manage these feelings. I was left in the limbo that is being an asshole for a short time until I started reading and educating myself on how taking responsibility and valuing other people around me.

"WOOOOAAAHHHHHH there. Did I say something that you took personally, or anything that insulted or offended you? I'm honestly asking to be sure here, because frankly, I think you've read into this. Hell, maybe I worded it in a way that seemed all inclusive, but I'd like to think most people can uphold and suspect a little assumed discretion. Against my better judgement, I should have made clearer because I realize my previous response was very abrasive.

I am well aware of women who know hard work, sacrifice, and carrying their, if not MORE than their own weight. I am the luckily kept, unplanned byproduct of an abandoned mother who managed to become naturalized work, get her degree and teach others, raise me, and believe it or not, she was able to instill what little morality honestly say I have. If it wasn't for her, I'd be in pretty deep shit about a lot more than just women, sir.

I can NOT and will NOT speak for anyone. I'd like to think it's pretty evident that what and who I refer to is all sourced from my own personal experience. In said experience I've found myself with every manner of incorrigible discontent from yes, women, romantic partners (which I'll clarify in a bit in case there's a confusion) who, otherwise, I've noticed are very capable and contrasting, well-meaning people. However I'VE reached a crossroads where I don't want to repeat the same mistakes I've made, and, right now that inquiry comes in the form of finding out whether I've been too submissive and unnecessarily forgiving, or too  stubborn and insatiable leading to torpedoing anything either way.

To answer the first part, in case I still look as if I have a foot in my mouth, yes, it DOES have all to do with romantic partners, but in my case that transcends more than forgetful encounter, It's not quite a solidified relationship yet, but in that sort of middling stage. The easiest part of my life, I only realize now, was when I worried about how I was going to get laid. I don't know if that's what you've interpreted my end goals here, but I've definitely something more long-term in mind, something that can't be laughed or explained away in in a cheap gag. So NO, I DON'T think all women are worthless, or freeloaders, or worthless freeloaders.

Honestly, I'm at a point where if a hookup is all that's on the table, I'm really not going to lose any sleep or have the urgency to spout off anything hateful or, negative even, about women or anything in any capacity. I not completely opposed to an asshole sort of pursuit, but bitching and berating women is not the way I go about that. If you'll forgive me, I'm getting accustomed to absolutely unleashing in this outlet that I don't find to be harmful. I don't realize that, whatever I find cathartic, is going to come off like some serious issues to anyone who envisions the same nerves offline. 

Well, these nerves especially manifest themselves, namely because I'm unfailingly surprised; I always wind up in the loop of insanity, even though I don't seek the exact same resolution more than once. None of this ever seems to go down a predictable route, but it's always the same disappointing outcome. I was pretty juvenile when it came to what women wanted, and then when started to accept the individuality, I became doubtful, if you can believe the arrogance of just what was being asked or expected, and if each woman really had a warranted request, and if I felt like it was something that I should be doing because I never liked compromise, but that's the whole point. As of now, I'm lost in thinking I'll be dissatisfied regardless, but I also worry about the potential of losing a good thing on account of backing out because I needed everything to feel good.

I just want to do what's right, and not something that's premature, not knowledgeable, insincere, inconsiderate or anything that seems generic or whimsical without at least some kind rationale and explanation. I'm sorry if I've upset you, really. If I've come off discouraged to any degree whatsoever, it's only based on my personal experience. I'm a big ""broad strokes get the fence painted faster"" kind of asshole. I've always considered it presumptuous and time-consuming to lay out acknowledgement of the possible variables, exceptions and wildcards that apply to any commentary on collective wrongdoing. I'll be sure so not leave anything that can be so easily misconstrued like that in the future. 

As I've said, I can never speak for anyone else, I, do not know understand or live anyone else's life but my own. I can live for years with someone and still never be able to fully comprehend what they feel and what's hurting them, even if I had a pretty good idea. I lived for quite a long time having a lot of trials dismissed or ignored  and, especially after that, I could never marginalize anyone else. I don't pretend to know why, but I do believe I'm within reasonable right to question and express discontent for something that still amounts to, at the very least, questionable and inconsiderate behavior."

So if you have 6 disagreements/conflicts, 5 of them should be addressed amicably/positively and only one can be ""bad"". Researchers showed that they could use this ratio to predict divorce with 90% accuracy.

"A few weeks ago on one of the subs here, there was a post from a girl telling a story about how her boyfriend beat the crap out of her (admittedly dick-ish) ""guy friend"" because of like *one* snide remark the guy made, and got physically violent with *her* too in the heat of the moment. She was rightfully freaked out and scared by this even though her boyfriend ""said he was really sorry the next day."" I was insulted, berated, and vilified for stating that beating someone up for ""saying something I didn't like"" is *not* okay, and that losing control of oneself to the point that they are getting violent with their girlfriend too is some *psychopath* shit. When I tried to explain that violence is for defending yourself and others from actual harm (unless authorized to do so for some other reason) and that this is rule #1 in pretty much any martial arts or combat training, people just kept calling me all kinds of names (Soy Boy) and saying ""that's why you'll never be respected anywhere you go."" When I explained that I don't feel the need to go around beating people up to earn respect, they just doubled down. It pissed me off at first, but eventually I just let it be. I have a similar mindset when I see things in the news that piss me off. ""Yeah, that sucks but I can't control it and getting all worked up about it isn't going to help anything. I can't change the world, but I can do right by the people around me and that's enough."" Some people are just assholes, and there is no reasoning with them. I was more scared that some of these people were claiming to be military and supported the guy because ""applying force is actually a quick and effective way to end a conflict... not just in the service but in your *personal life* too!""

I’d lean more agnostic personally since the possibility of a god who exists outside the universe solely as an observer and outside of our ability to observe is ever present.

"Making it a habit is the best way to go. then you can get fancy with different routines later. When I've occasionally slacked off on working out, the way I got back in was to get a wall calendar and say ""okay if I work out for five minutes on a day (doing some pushups, crunches, running, whatever) then I can put an X over that day on the calendar."" After a few days I get a streak going and then I don't want to break my streak, so I keep doing my five minutes a day and that gradually turns into more. Basically the idea is to set a very, very low bar and then stick with it, because once it becomes a habit you'll find yourself doing more. After you get used to doing some type of exercise every day it's much easier to then do fancier stuff. Like if you want to go to a gym, start by literally just going there, and if you've gone there on a day you succeeded and can put an X on your calendar. Once you have the habit of going there that will turn into working out there. Having the physical calendar or even a computer spreadsheet helps you feel accountable and also helps you feel like youre making progress as the Xs start to pile up."

"Sweden and it's rape stats sure they are high but only because every single instance of rape count separately. e.g. someone raping there spouse every day for a year counts as 365 cases of rape. In other countries it counts as one.

On a similar note India's rape stats aren't any worse than any comparable nation. (In fact lower than some western nations though likely under reported) It's just that around a 5th of all humans live there so, combined with a free press, you're more likely to hear a nasty story from there."

"I have really bad social anxiety and last week I went to a nightclub. I saw an attractive girl at a nearby table, and I wanted to get up and talk to her and when the music came on, I wanted to ask her to dance with me.....but I couldn't. I was absolutely frozen with fear. I was so upset  with myself for not finding the courage to aproach her it completely ruined my night and I left. I was walking down the sidewalk fuming. I swore I would never go to another nightclub again.....but I'm going to the same nightclub again tonight and going to try again if I see another woman I find attractive, I'm going to do it this time. No excuses. Suck it up, swallow the damn pill and do it."

"The difference is to the extent that you would go for someone. 

Infatuation mimics the sensation of love. You see them and smile, you think of them often, your eyes and face light up at their mention. You get the warm and fuzzy feelings. You want to be with them.

&amp;#x200B;

But love, love distinguishes itself because you want what will be good for them even if you're not with them. You want them to have the best that they can however great or small it may hurt you. When it's love, even if you do have them; you're willing to concede to their desires sometimes without quarrel. You feel so deeply in love with them that no labor is too great, nothing is a ""sacrifice"", and even if it feels that way because whatever you're doing, or not doing for or because of them. You're doing so happily. 

&amp;#x200B;

Infatuation feels as love does; but love fearlessly travels places where infatuation dares not. "

If a woman wants to be sexy, she can absolutely express that. Low-cut tops, showing midriff, short skirts, bras that push the boobs up more, and so on.

Jews certainly don’t “control the media” etc. but are definitely “overrepresented” in a lot of high-profile industries in terms of population, for a couple of major reasons:

1. Judaism is a religion that values education and intellectualism. In many Jewish schools of thought, questioning scripture and religious figures is seen as a virtue rather than a vice. This lends itself to an environment where people actively seek out higher education at a rate which isn’t paralleled everywhere in the US. Turns out getting more education on average prepares you for better white-collar jobs.

2. Jews were heavily persecuted in medieval and post-medieval Eastern Europe (and wherever else they ended up post-Diaspora) by Christians. Christians were disallowed from lending money etc. to other Christians, and also didn’t want to patronize Jewish shopkeepers, merchants, etc. So, in many places, they banned Jews from holding those jobs and heavily pressured them into providing the banking services they needed. So Jews having a history of banking is much the fault of Christian persecution. Congrats, you played yourself."

"First date, we bonded over what she immediately recognized as a [semi-obscure 30 Rock reference](https://i.gifer.com/origin/96/96d57473d1eaa606773e16c54cb36d7e_w200.webp) that I had said more to amuse myself than anything else. We are now married."

"The real point of this little story comes at the end.

My wife and I were parked at a gas station.  Nearby, a lady got out of her car while it was still on, in order to clean the windshield or something, and after she took a couple steps away from the car, it started to crawl forward.  Evidently she forgot to put it in park.

She realized what was happening, but the driver's side door was on the other side of the car at this point, and it was starting to move faster and faster, and the car was about to bang into a big concrete post.  She panicked a little bit (with admittedly not a lot of options) and made gah-oh-no-oh-no-stop-STOP-AH gestures.

I hopped out of my car and ran over to hers, and just got in front of her car and pushed.  The car wasn't going fast, so it wasn't like I was stopping a speeding train.  I just needed to stop a car that was idling forward.

I got the car to stop before it hit the concrete post, and she ran around to the driver's side and turned off the car or put it in park.  She said thanks,  I said ""No problem,"" and went back to my car, happy to have done my good deed for the day.

Here's the point of the story: My wife said that there was a car full of guys watching when this started to unfold, and they were all laughing at the lady with the car.  My wife says that, when I ran up and actually tried to help, my wife felt really proud of me, compared to the car full of able-bodied young men sitting on their asses.

I have flaws, including a tendency to discount other people's emotional journeys more than I should.  I think this can cause me to not realize when someone's feelings are being hurt, but I also like to think it makes me less susceptible to the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect).  If no one is helping, it doesn't even occur to me to just watch without  helping because it might feel more natural to fit in, because fuck everyone else, their motivations are boring and irrelevant.

My wife mentions this little incident every once in a while when, for whatever reason, she needs to come up with something nice to say about me.  So it's nice to have done something that your wife can honestly say is a reason why she thinks you're worth her time."
Uhm my hair maybe? But only because I’m 32 and no sign of thinning or balding. I have hair like the men on my moms side. Both my uncles full heads of hair in their 50’s and my moms grandpa had a full head of thick hair in his 80’s when he died.

Girl game is weeding through the pile to find a quality, in demand man and getting his commitment and ""drawing him in"" if you will. Women these days, for the most part, try and fuck their way into a relationship. That's the male game equivalent of trying to get in a relationship by being nice and buying her stuff."
"&gt; Without being patronising, you’ll get teased for anything when you’re young/teenage, and it’s horrible at the time, but as everyone grows up, it’ll get better. 

I'd just like to confirm the other person's point that this is usually the case.  Adults are usually more kind than teenagers, just because adults' peers are typically smart enough to realize that cruel people are poison, and to stay away from them.  If you are a typical adult and you want to lose your friends, let them see you being cruel for no reason.

Adults also have more choice regarding whom they hang out with.  Being in school with other kids is a lot like being in prison, and the society teenagers make for themselves in some ways ends up being a lot like prison society.

The development of empathy and the [prefrontal cortex](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14738243/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/study-teenage-brain-lacks-empathy/) may also have something to do with it.

I also don't mean to be patronizing.  I know from personal experience that there are lots of young people who are very kind.  For example, I'm sure that you are unlikely to hurt another person for their physical appearance.  Your situation has hurt you (obviously), but you also have a stronger sense of compassion than your peers as a result."

"I am happy that in my country it is not that common, although I know some people are doing this here too mainly due to dating apps.

I just don't imagine how that could work for me. I don't have that much time throughout a week, so I could do maybe two dates per week, but would need to stop seeing friends. I am also poor as fak and I can't afford buying drinks and food to random girls. The most I did was texting multiple women from tinder at once, but even that is draining since I don't like texting. I don't want dating to be my life, I have more interesting things to do.

Even though I probably would not do that, I think it is okay to have like multiple first dates, but for me that should end as soon as you have a second date.

"You tried your best and I don't blame you for your sorry comings because I know you grew up with no direction or support but I need you to learn from your mistakes too. 

When I fell into the bon fire when camping as a teen, there's a reason I called your ex husband for help and not you, despite him being a state away.

When your current husband abused me and my brother and you told us to turn the other cheek or ""it's just because he's insecure"", that just made me stop telling you. 

When I told you about my first gf and you dismissed it, I turned to the internet for help with girls which wasn't good enough. 



I needed you in my corner unconditionally. I needed an ally. I needed guidance. I needed someone to be logical when I couldn't be.

"Prices may vary from pharmacy to pharmacy, but IIRC the cash price for generic Viagra where I work is less than $1 per pill.

You should see a doctor for a prescription, to make sure that you're getting a safe and legitimate product, to make sure you get proper instruction on how to use it appropriately (there *are* risks involved, especially with improper use!), and so the doctor can screen for any underlying health issues that may be behind the ED.

True physiologic ED usually is caused by a circulatory issue that might mean you're at higher risk of heart attack and stroke, so the sooner you can get on top of that and get on appropriate preventive treatment the better your chances of living a long and healthy life. Alternatively, there's a small chance it could be related to a hormone imbalance, if you're having other symptoms related to that sort of stuff. If you're physically capable of getting an erection in some contexts, but not when it really counts, that indicates a psychological cause that a doctor could refer you to a counselor for. These are all things you want to have checked out before you just start popping pills!"

"Having most of what I need ready at home makes it easier. I no longer have the excuse of being to lazy or tired to ""go"" to the gym. The gym's already at my house. 

Start with something simple like Mondays being arms or shoulders. Use the weekend or workday of Monday to make a simple routine like curls or presses. Tuesday do lower body or abs and use your free time to look up some simple exercises. Wednesday do upper body but not the same parts you did Monday, hopefully your not too sore. Rest on weekends. Always look up new stuff to do to keep it fresh and interesting. Start small and build then you'll look forward to it like I do and feel worse if you end up skipping a day.

"To build on what you’re saying, the Official Word from the church has never been hostile to evolution. The very first mentions of it by a pope in the late 1870s were essentially saying that as long as it doesn’t deny that God created the universe *somehow*, there’s no issue.

Also,[here’s a fun little list.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_clergy_scientists) To be quite honest, I don’t really know why the church got so worked up about Galileo, but it gets such a bad rap because of that one incident."

"All of reddit thinks they’re over 150 lolol. 

When only about 2% of people are over 130. 

My wife has been a high school counselor for ten years and has a lot of insights on this. I was actually identified as “gifted” in school and was over 140iq at the time but I’m aware that this number changes through life. 

A lot of people with higher IQs have difficulties in the classroom similar to kids with low IQs. Kids who understand the material faster than the teacher can teach are just as restless as kids that simply don’t get it. I NEVER did homework when I was little because it was incredibly boring and redundant. This got me in similar problems as the kids who were failing their classes.

Mind you I've got years of experience in the role, so if anything I was slightly overqualified. 

I blew the phone interview out of the water. 

The interview was going well when all of the sudden I got thrown a curveball I wasn't expecting.

""Well Mr. \_\_\_\_, that's nice enough for some but I'm really struggling here to deem you as competent for the role.""

I stopped and turned around to him and did something that was very stupid in retrospective. But it was in the heat of the moment. 

""Look at me. If you think there are candidates that are a better fit. That's one thing. The professional thing to do is say, we'll get in touch and call me back saying someone else was selected. But listen to me. If you EVER call me incompetent again. I'm going to show you how 'competent' (I used air quotes) at feeding you your fucking dentures old man!""

(despite being, in my own opinion, not particularly good looking.)

However when I actually *interacted* with him, he never actually treated me badly nor ever did me wrong. Even though he wasn't a guy I would hang out with, he seemed to be an alright dude overall.

I came to realize I was actually just jealous of him: he was this dude who I viewed as an ""asshole"" and always got hot girls (despite not being particularly great looking in my own opinion) when I myself couldn't get a girlfriend if my life depended on it. In the end though even if the guy was really an asshole, he was never an asshole to *me*."

"I was 21 and had just got my first well paying job out of grad school. I moved across the country (from southern CA to the east coast) and was looking at trading in my 2WD mustang for something more suitable for winter roads. So I went to the dealer and asked to test drive one of their used vehicles. The salesman, assuming that I was 16, said “No, I can’t let you do that, son. How about you go get your mom and come back so I can make a copy of her license”. 

Now, I understand that I look young, but regardless, that’s no way to treat someone who’s about to make a $20k purchase. I was speechless for a second, tried to think of a good response, but only came up with “I’m 21, how about you fuck off!”. Needless to say, I didn’t buy the car from him."

"My father is a wonderful man but a very hot-headed one and I got a nasty temper from him (woman here -- and yes, I know you're truly shocked, but women can get angry too ;)

It took me years but what finally worked for me was putting myself in the shoes of the other person I was angry at. A driver cut me off? I've done that before too. Maybe he's late for his job and could get fired or he has some other emergency. That cashier's taking forever? She's probably making shit for a living and having problems paying her bills. I'm jealous of a gorgeous woman or someone who got that promotion I didn't? I remind myself that they've probably got a ton of personal problems just like everyone else -- or they inevitably will at some point in their lives.

Figure out exactly why you're angry in each situation. Once you really analyze it, you'll begin to realize how petty and unnecessary it is -- and how much the anger is ultimately only hurting you in the end -- not the other person."

Outside of that, right up there would be winning a 2nd division scrabble tournament one time.

"Most ultra orthodox Jews are actually not ambitious at all these days. (The community has moved more religiously to the right, meaning in the future most Jews will be ultra orthodox since they have 6-15 children). Many of them work at B&amp;H on 9th ave and 34th street to pay for their washington heights mice and roach infested apartments. So your Jewish doctors, bankers, lawyers will now be your asian, African, and latino doctors, bankers, and lawyers. Hell, most of them dont even graduate from high school anymore. However, this is MOSTLY true for jewish MALES. The girls are normal and very bright and are going to law school and medical school. 

There’s actually a huge drug problem with chassidim in crown heights, boro park, and williamsburg in brooklyn. Ive had many Jewish boys express their drug issues with me on first dates (they’re off the derech/religious path which means screw morals, let’s put everything bad into my body and have sex with anything that has a vagina).

Many of the Jews in media are not even Jewish anymore, they just have their father’s last name. And they hate zionism and the the state of israel. 

But wait, there’s more!!

The yeshiva system is in fact a money grubbing institution. So this is how it goes. Your rich less religious parents sent you a fancy yeshiva from k-12, sent you to seminary/yeshiva in israel for 1 year, and now you’re brainwashed by the system now become more religious, have a low paying job, and make sure to have at least 4 children. More children=more money for the yeshivas. With tuition costing $20/child, that’s $80k per year! But wait, your husband is either learning talmud all day and/or is a social worker earning $40k, and ideally as a female you earn $60k from being a pt/ot/spl/teacher. So how do you afford your residence in Lawrence or Midwood that is walking distance to a minyan?? Your parents pay for stuff, yay! Either yeshiva, or your mortgage, perhaps. But wait there’s more! You need to always go on vacation during pesach/winter/sukkot break so your kids can have something to say when the teacher goes around the room asking the children what they did during their week off! Israel or north miami beach or disney world is preferred, obviously. But wait, we aren’t finished yet! Now that it’s summer, you have to send your kids to camp like morsha, seneca, lavi, or mesorah! Can’t look cheap and poor and have your kids go to those other crappy camps. So what’s our total?? Who cares, your parents will pay for everything! 

And this is probably why people hate jews.

"Oh well I think shy and awkward is attractive for some reason it’s always turned me on. I’m my head it makes someone way more genuine than people who say some smooth line....

But in fact I found because most awkward people think it’s a negative trait they try to overcorrect which also makes them less genuine. Then in my experience because I love them for exactly who they are, they start to assume because I know they’re shy and awkward that I have no right to expect them to talk to me directly and honestly about a situation; they assume because it makes them feel awkward to do so that they don’t have to and I should just understand and read their mind. 

Shortly into those types of relationships it turns emotionally abusive where they have me walking on eggshells because they’re uncomfortable with everything and then it just is too much effort for me to maintain and still feel ok myself.

If I met a man who was shy and awkward and had open conversations with me where sometimes they say the wrong things or are a little too blunt, I’d love them even more for it because it makes me feel like I have the room to be human too- just need to find a man who knows how to be what he is but also doesn’t excuse himself from the effort involved in maintaining a respectful relationship. 

Communication is still key.... but I like messy communication where people are themselves without the weird pretence 

I hope that makes sense! "

"The fuck is everyone recommending protein shakes for? There is not many calories in them.  It's gonna be useless money if OP isn't working out. 

Protein shakes are for getting enough protein.  Not Calories.  If you wanna do  protein shakes use whole milk.  

Pasta.  Rice.  Oats.  Nuts.  Ground Beef. 
Chicken (Use thighs, more calorie dense than breasts) Peanut butter scoops throughout the day

I mean, I would support her 100%.  I'd even film her using the vibrator, just because I'm a nice guy.

But really, it would be kinda gross if some guy didn't 'let' his girlfriend use a vibrator.  And it would be a joke, because she would do it anyway.

"The labeling is a constant problem.  You'll find that the word atheist fits a lot of lexical gaps.  Atheist doesn't have a consistent dictionary definition.  The word originally referred to the Christians (who worshipped the wrong gods), and I still own a dictionary that defines atheist as ""deviant, immoral, pervert"".  Some modern dictionaries get it right, others go with the definition you just gave.  So who is right here?    


Most in the atheist community take atheist to mean the opposite of theist (someone who believes there is a god).  So atheist just means that a person lacks a belief in a god.  Folks in that community also use the word agnostic to refer to someone who doesn't know if there is a god or not (the opposite is gnostic, which is someone who knows for certain).  Most folks under the atheist umbrella would consider themselves agnostic atheists.  


This leads to a labeling crisis, and you get all sorts of flavors of atheist.  We all tend to use atheist as short hand, but you'll find:  
Agnostic atheist (doesn't know if there is a god, but doesn't believe in one)  
De-Facto atheist (waiting for anyone to show facts that there could be a god)  
Strong atheist (The kind that believes there is 100% no god out there \[the kind you described\])  
Weak atheist (Simply lacks belief in any god)  
and the list goes on.  


I'm an agnostic atheist, but most folks don't care, so I shorten it.  


(This doesn't even get into the problems that the term ""god"" isn't defined.  The sun is considered by a god to many, and an atheist can still believe that the sun exists.)"

"I will fully admit that I have this. Mostly cause I just don't care most of the time. For context, I live in a very small town (less than 100 people). Lived here all my life. So when I'm here I really don't care what I look like because the only women I can impress are my cousins and 90 year old widows. 

Now if I go to the city, to visit friends or family. Then yes I will shave and clean up, simply because there is a higher chance of running into a chick that I won't have to worry about having a Hapsburg type kid if we hook up."

"So, when it comes to film industry office jobs you absolutely positively need to be here in person. No exception. There's no way anyone here hires anytime who doesnt live here. Things move way too fast. You'll have an interview at 3pm. You'll get hired on the spot and start the next day at 8am. That's 99.9999% of the time. What's left is when a studio head has a nephew who goes to college out of state and hooks him up with a job. And they'll give him time to relocate. That's the only way you'll find someone who'll how you out of state: if you're related to a big player in the film industry.

When assistants leave whoever they work for the producer/agent/showrunner/whoever needs a replacement immediately. If you're serious about getting into the industry then save up some money to live on, sublet a room here, come out for a few months and just blanket the city with your resume for assistant/entry level positions. Also temp agencies out here are really amazing for some people. A lot of the time people temp when someone's agent moves on. Then the boss likes the temp so they just hire them to stay on. 

It's tough. Real tough, not going to lie but you can do it. Everyone I know who works in the film industry now has done it. I know people who went to film school at USC and they're not in film anymore. They're back home working in retail, which is fine and all. But, they were the ones who for one reason or another didn't take steps to get into the industry.

So man, you can do it. Save money and make it happen."

* Is the beer spending too much for the budget?

"I totalled mine in a crash and had to walk home. I didn't have good insurance so I went a year without a car. It wasn't a super bad crash, but for the next year driving was so stressful that I barely got behind the wheel even when people (housemates) had offered their car to me. Sometimes I would convince myself to drive and I would get so stressed that I would park and walk the rest of the way. Getting rid of my car wasn't super sad, but it took a long time to get over. on the bright side the day of the car crash I got the rest of the day off work, and my coffee shop gave me a free drink.

Ok, for some context we were juniors in high school at the time, my parents were divorced and i had a fairly abusive father who shared custody of me week on week off with my mom (that'll make more sense when things start to get weird), and when we met, she had initially only approached me to tell me that her friend (another girl in our class who was a year younger than us) was into me. I wasn't really into her friend because of this, but this mormon girl was kinda cute, athletically coordinated, and kinda goofy, so naturally i was kinda more into her. We talked for most of the class, hung out at lunch after too, and walked home together after school. Things were going pretty normally and a conversation was able to be held pretty easily, but my first warning that i totally missed was when the friend drove by, saw us, and gave her the death glare, her response was ""oops, she wasn't supposed to see us.... oh well, you're too good for her anyway."" I think that stroked my ego a bit because at the time i saw that as a green flag rather than a red one. So we got to my place and i opened the door (we have a combination keypad lock rather than a key, because my dad was a paranoid shithead) and we played some pool, after a few hours hanging at my place, i leaned in to kiss her and she backed away, saying that she wanted to but was nervous and would be against her religion. I didn't push all too hard but she gave in and was really happy about it, and i was pretty excited about it. I walked her home, said goodnight, walked back to my place and went on with my night. Next day was when shit started hitting the fan. We talked a little less, didn't have plans to hang out after school or anything, just kinda had a normal day. Ends up raining so I call my mom to get a ride to my dad's. My mom pulls up at the school and seemingly out of thin air, Mormon girls pops up and is walking towards our truck. Walks up to my mom's window, introduces herself,asks how my mom is, what her name is, proceeds to have a conversation about how nice i am and how much of a joy i am to be around. Thought to myself, okaaay this is a little weird, right? Convince myself that she's just a really sweet, extremely upfront person, second mistake. Mom drops me off at my dads, get a few messages from the Mormon girl telling me how sweet my mom is, how she was happy to meet her, insisted that she really wants to meet my dad, and that we should hang out soon. I assured her that my dad is most definitely not the kind of person you'd want to meet and i made it clear that i had absolutely no intentions of introducing them, and that there was no way he'd let me leave the house that day because well idk he didn't like me going out i guess. She wasn't happy about it but conceded and understood. Now i added these details about my dad, and this conversation because it makes this next part all the more crazy, and also embarrassing for me to admit that it's not the point that i decided to break it off. So the next morning, my dad leaves for work at around 6:30 am, and i wake up at 7. My dad leaving usually half wakes me up, so like rustling of shoes and various sounds but i never fully wake up and end up falling asleep again until my alarm goes off. Wake up at 7 and open my eyes to the MORMON GIRL'S SLEEPING FACE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF MY FACE. She was not there at 6:30 when my dad left or when i fell back asleep. I was taken so aback i fell out of my bed in shock, but so shocked i had absolutely nothing to say. I just kinda looked at her not really believing that she was there, and told her that i was just gonna go take a shower to get ready for school. Didn't occur to me until waaay later, but in order for her to be there in the first place, she would have had to peer over my shoulder for the door combo 2 days prior, remembered it, camped out in front of or around my house waiting for my dad to leave which btw, i never told her his schedule, and then sneak in without being seen by neighbors, my dog, and trust that nobody else was in my house. Creepy. Next step was when i got into the shower, i was still waking up, kinda taking my time, heard the door crack open, thought it was my dog. Nope, it was her. sneaking into the bathroom while i was in the shower, quietly. And i could see her silhouette through the sliding glass shower doors. Not a word, not a sound, and she just sat down, next to the tub, for my 30 minute [shower. Got](https://shower.got) out and wrapped a towel around me, to which she just said, oh hey whats up. Considering this was day 3 of knowing each other and being i think 16, i was very, very uncomfortable. I decided it would be a good idea to skip school this day, and calmly talk with her about how i was feeling about this, I was very much treating her like a hair triggered lunatic. We took a walk and the conversation we had was aaaaall over the place. Talking about taking her virginity, sports, school, friends, home life, talking about our difference in opinions of religion. That's when she brought up the aforementioned ""i would leave you for the church if the church wanted me to"" thing, i said that i had a problem with that, and religion in general, which is when she decided that i wasn't right for her lol and we left it at that. She later did try to sabotage a few future relationships i tried to have by telling the girls that i tried to use her, but hose stories are far less interesting.

I don't wanna reread this to fix typos so if you have questions ask.

TL;DR: Kissed a mormon girl on the first day that i met her after hitting it off, she then proceeded to forcefully meet my mother, attempt to forcefully meet my father, sneak into my house and my bed, watch me silently while i was in the shower, and then decided we weren't gonna work because i didn't agree with her Mormon religious beliefs all in the span of 3-5 days.

"I was 23, she was mid to late 50s.  She was also a pornstar from the golden age of porn, and just so happened to star in one of the first pornos I ever owned on VHS as a kid, so it was kinda cool.  "
"I am 6'1, not particularly tall but tall enough that it's never really an issue. I see a lot of people lamenting their shortness and don't envy them.

"Your in a good situation. So your living with your parents which is totally normal for the millenial generation. This is going to give you the opportunity to save as much money as possible. If your not dating that means you can save even more money. So do the money thing first. 

Go out this week and get a personal trainer and set some targets for building up your physique and health. This will do wonders for you self esteem and confidence and is good for you health. 

You put dating and sex first so I'm assuming they're issues causing you some anxiety. I think you need to shift your focus away from this dating and onto improving yourself. You will be more successful dating if you are happier and have a more positive attitude. So focus on that first. 

Set goals: 
1) Do at least 30 minutes of exercise daily and build up muscle by lifting weight. 
2) Save 80% of your pay each pay cycle. (aiming to by a fucking awesome car in 2 years.)
3) Aim to reduce screen time on the by 60% and get outside. 

You also need to set a career goal. What did you study at college? 

Also what are your hobbies? and do you own a dog?

"Getting older.

One thing that has really helped me is in finding a gym that has scheduled sessions led by coaches. I've always had a problem with not knowing what to do at the gym and being reluctant to try and get help from someone else and also with having the motivation to go to the gym regularly.

I've found that having coach led sessions means I need just enough motivation to get to the gym for the session and after that there's a feeling of both peer pressure and not letting someone down that makes me stay and do it. The coaches also have their workout plans set up to exercise what needs to be exercised and are there to provide encouragement and advice on form. 

This won't be the cheapest option but for me the cost is worth what I'm getting out of it."

"Depends on the circumstances. If she calls him cute with lots of kisses, then that's hot as fuck. If it's more like ""nice try"", then we won't date again."

"I'd probably be pretty stoked about it. It might not be the ideal phrasing, but she cared enough to say something."
"Try a few sessions. A lot of gyms usually have some trial period so you can get a feel for the format and decide if you want to sign up.

Don't neglect nutrition either. Getting fit requires good nutrition because you don't want a poor diet to cancel out any exercising you're doing."
Nah. Then again switching companies has always worked better for me than gunning for a promotion so I pretty much ignored it all.
i don’t think i’ve ever been complimented on my penis. Cute kinda sounds weird. like you call a puppy cute. not a penis.

"I've done this.  My workplace has alternating Mondays off, federal holidays off, etc, and sometimes the alternating Mondays off will get knocked off course because of a Federal Holiday (they don't like giving us two three-day weekends in a row) and unless you pay attention to the work calendar, you could forget that you have work on Monday.

So anyways, I had a really laid-back supervisor at that time and I'd been working on a project where I just went in my office and stayed on my computer doing paperwork almost all day every day.  I start work at 7 in the mornings.  I wake up at about 10:30 AM and see a text from a coworker saying ""Do you mind if I borrow your label printer?"".  It wasn't unheard of for this coworker to do overtime on an off day, as his section was short-staffed to just him doing three people's jobs.  I text back ""sure"".  He texts back ""thanks, enjoy your day off"" - I just though ""It's weird that he'd refer to a weekend as a day off"" but dismissed it because he's the weird guy in the office.  I got up, cooked myself some pancakes, went fishing, and had a hell of a day.  I came in the next morning and my coworker tells me he put my label printer back in my office, and I said something along the lines of ""Man, you've been coming in and doing overtime a lot, you need any help?"" and that's when he told me Monday wasn't an off day and that he assumed I'd taken leave.  I practically ran to my supervisor's office, and burst in with ""I forgot yesterday was a work day and didn't come in, I'm so sorry"".  His response was perfect: ""You... weren't here yesterday?  Like, ever?""  I said yes.  ""How close are you on your project right now?"" I told him I was close.  ""You think you could finish it today?"" I told him no, that I'd need a day and a half.  ""You think you could finish it today if you stayed a couple hours late?""  I told him sure.  ""Then don't worry about putting in a leave request for yesterday.""

So that was great.  Sidenote:  I finished the project an hour early that day, and he was so happy that he just told me to go home early.  

I miss that guy sometimes.  New guy is big on checking in with your supervisor when you get to work, all office doors must be open, no music, no smoke breaks, he needs a report on your tasklist at the beginning of every week, wants to micro-manage your projects, etc.  All practices that only work in theory - in reality, people hate coming to work and their reduced productivity shows it.

"I manage a large team and hire folks pretty regularly. Personally, I expect the candidate to try to negotiate so I generally come in a bit low with the first offer. It still amazes me that 90% of candidates just accept it. I've never just accepted an offer.

"Idk. It's much easier to win debates with women, if they are romantically interested in you and respect you. They are just too emotionally stubborn otherwise.

I managed to convince a lot of men over the internet of my positions in many debates, but women kinda shut down. Ignore half the arguments and then say ""breitbart is not reliable"".
I think it's a defense mechanism. They dont want to submit to anyone that isn't their boyfriend."
