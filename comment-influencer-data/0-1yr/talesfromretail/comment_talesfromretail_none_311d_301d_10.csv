"A shocking amount of people have no concept of ‘percent’, despite the fact that the word actually tells you what it is."
She is one those unicorns you get while working retail. 
You did the right thing
"When people make me stay late I have no problem making them stay late too. 

We have one woman who routinely gets an entire cart full of stuff and only comes up to the self-checkout registers a couple minutes before we close. This isn't a case of ""oh sorry I didn't know you guys closed right now""... she does this *every week*. And without fail she usually has 5-10 items she decides she isn't getting. 

Recently what I've started doing is I'll wait until she's almost finished her order, and *then* I'll go put back all the things she didn't want. She then has to wait at the door (which I've locked by this point, you know, because we're closed) until I finish and can come open it for her."
"I had an issue like this too!

I'm a manager at a drug store that specializes in cosmetics. I'm also a guy, bigger build, RBF, mean looking at rest basically. This lady approached me in the cosmetics area and asks, ""can I speak to a cosmetics employee?"" I tell her, ""oh, I'm free to help you out!"" She laughs and says, ""oh, no, no. You don't know anything about makeup."" 
Now, I dabble in special effects makeup and do a lot of studying for it, as well as basic makeup so I at least know what I'm doing at work. I managed to convince this woman that I could help her and all she needed was an affordable eyeliner. She apparently didn't think I would know the difference between a brow liner and an eyeliner."
SO happy the dad didn't take it out on you. Too many of these kinds of stories end with someone getting angry. A+ Dad.
She actually asked someone else in line for a nickel!
She waited until they were engaged to be comfortable enough to unleash the crazy
That is such a common tactic now it's nice to see people don't get sucked and pay attention especially after working a long shift. 
"The best part would have been had she ended by saying ""ope don't have enough"" and pulled out her cc"
I got nervous reading your title this would be a story about rude customers. But this just made my day! It makes me so happy knowing there are still nice people in this world who appreciate good customer service 
"10 minutes later than normal?  Sorry, that's a ""meh."""
"People tend to judge. I did not look the part of a manager (understatement of the year), and got into a lot of funny situations because of it.
The funniest was some hotshot seller walking in of the street, all smug in attitude. Brochures with flower supplies neatly under his arm. He looked around and saw me standing by the cash register. He walked up and didn't even look at me when he demanded to speak to the manager. I asked him what for. He got irritated and said that i could not help him. I said that he could tell me what it was about. He got more frustrated at told me to just go get the manager. I said ""You are talking to the manager."" needless to say, he did not get a sale."
"Retail can be terrible,  but sometimes the interactions with strangers can be pure magic."
At our *INSERT STORE HERE* we explicitly tell people DO NOT REFORMAT YOUR XBOX ONE. At ours the internet is so bad we once sat there THREE HOURS waiting for the download only to hit 50%.
The best little old I ever had was one after an extremely difficult customer. She patted my hand and said “don’t worry dear she’s just a bitch” in a very loud voice. The first woman heard and went ridged and while walking out.
How do you not process something so simple as 'we do not sell this brand here'? I would have shown her the paint aisle and said ok go find your brand!
"I’ve had this attempted on me as well, only the guy tried to confuse me as much as possible by hiding the $100 (he put it in the counter, but put it under his wallet) then asking for the oddest assortment of change in order to confuddle as much as possible, then make off with all of it.

I caught on, but ultimately only because I got so confused by his requests that I put everything back into the register and started over.

He got grumpy at me, and took back his $100 bill and paid for his $1.69 total with two ones.

I won that round."
Kinda glad his dad called him out on this. All too many parents would still blame you
"Good for you, I'm so glad a manager didn't make you accept the return anyway"
"To all new couples: The way your new love treats service staff, or anyone else they feel like they have power over, is how they'll be treating you in six months."
"Good idea to tell the manager and possibly police. In our times, people making threats like that need to be taken seriously and be put on record. Hope your employer never leaves work into a deserted parking lot."
"What a good lady. Not only did it give you time to calm down, but it probably make you laugh a few times. There are sometimes good ones out there."
"Nice!  I had a gent do something similar to me at work a while back. I was sent over to help him with networking and approach him with a smile and a ""I've been told you need help with setting  up your network-"" and he looked me up and down. I was in full work uniform, same as any of the boys, and he says ""Oh, did they send me the cleaner?""

I smiled, forcefully. ""Oh, so you don't need help? I'll just-"" and turned. Then he back tracked and I helped him with a rather simple issue (which type of router for his connection etc) and some questions.

I have no idea how he can imply a girl can't help him when he, as a man, is standing there looking clueless.
"
And it's not even Black Friday. I'm already beginning my mental prep list. 
"This triggered a flashback from working at an name brand surf shop at an outlet mall ... we’d get busses of tourists(mostly Brazilian) who would come to us to get as much merchandise possible, for the least amount of money, so they could take it back to their country to resell it for triple the price here... 

“There’s no discounts you can give me on this?” 
“Anything you can do for me to make it cheaper?” 
“Can I take this book bag with this promotion but instead of the two shirts can I have another bookbag?”  

NO none of that is how these prices work ...

The “you are very bad at this” comment set me off... 
it’s like they think shopping in stores is a barter system and we NEED to move product right now... like ... I don’t care if this sells now, or ever, I’m not giving you discounts.. 

/end rant "
"If he is really fighting off cancer at 2 year old, why does she have in a busy store full of people and potential germs that could kill him or make him sicker??
I live in TN also, and my friends son is frequently at Lebonuer and ALWAYS has a mask on when in public."
"Why did you let her do the multiple transactions? You should have just stood your ground. If she doesn’t know elementary school math, that’s not your problem and your time sink. "
"I always hated doing carts because the weather in my area is never comfortable for our uniform clothes. I was always either sweating, freezing, or wrapped in a big coat. Plus, people throw their carts in random empty parking spaces before I could get to them."
"Why did you serve her? I would have told her to get out and banned her from the store, and if she didn't leave I'd have got the police to remove her and banned her from the store.

I don't understand this bend over backward mentality. This is exactly why they behave this way."
Is butter a carb?
"""We don't want it then.""  
Good. Because we... Don't sell it."
"""aaaaaaand it looks like we're out of boxes. Do you want me to put them in your hand?"""
"She had me laughing, but also the people behind her in line, so it just made everyone happy!"
"True, I saw a video of some cashier falling for it long time ago, and never thought I'd have someone try it on me. Glad I was paying attention."
I work at a video game store and I have to learn how to deal with tough customers. I always tend to excuse myself to the restroom to cry a bit. 
"This is why I shake my head whenever people get engaged and then married so quickly, this is the kind of thing you want to know about beforehand."
"I work in the seafood dept at an upstairs grocery store. Above my service counter is a 50 foot ""seafood"" sign and an 8 foot fish on a hook. Directly to my right, no more than 80 feet is the meat department. Their sign is almost twice the size of ours, and it's in red neon. At least 5 times a day people will come up to me and ask where the ribs/chicken/steak/hamburger is. All I do is point. "
"I get that a lot. We repeatedly get customers asking for a specific employee, thinking they are the inly ones capable of helping them. Here’s a recent conversation I had: “I’d like to speak to jack”
“Sure, can I ask what you’re calling about”
“He was helping me with a jacket”
“Okay sure, and what jacket was that?”
“Do you and I have a problem?”
“Um... no... just seeing if I can help, as the store is busy and jack isn’t available”
“I just don’t see how you can help”

Like damn lady let me know what you want, if I can’t I’ll get jack but he’s busy and I’m already on the phone with you "
