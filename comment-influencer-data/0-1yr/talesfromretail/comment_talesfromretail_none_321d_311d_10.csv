Why doesn't corporate realize that they are alienating more customers? I know it's the job but I don't want to be asked the same question after I've said no. 
"""maybe you should put up warning signs"" 
???? Maybe watch your fucking kid???"
"I had one of these but with a trespasser. They said they knew the owner and the owner had said it was ok for them to fish there. I asked who the owner was and he stuttered out a ‘Jeff somethings, it’s been a while’. I’m the owner, a woman. Women have owned this particular property for the last 3 decades with no husband or son named Jeff. "
"Seems like he looked at the original total before they paid $40, not the amount still owed.


I hope he understands the severity of his error."
I feel the same way. I would’ve let it go after the first no but my store manager was standing across from me hounding me over the walkie talkie to not take no as an answer 
"As soon as a guest says they know the owner or will contact their lawyer, we are told to immediately end the conversation and walk away. Really pisses these idiots off."
A popular one I've seen (Canada) is;  Unattended Children will be given an espresso and a free Kitten.
I'm convinced aliens are among us and some of them haven't fully grasped how to human.
"I don't like it when they get away with things like that. If she used a credit card so your company had her data, I wish they would at least send her notice that they know what she did and that she is banned from your store and all future purchases in person or online will not be accepted. "
"That’s when you say he can take over the transaction and show you how he would ask her 3 times. “She might sign up if you ask her, she’s already upset with me. Show me the best way to ask.” Put it on him to do it. "
"“... faster than I can jerk off.”

Well that’s an expression for the books if I ever heard one."
"""Hi, I'm not a baker, butcher, or anything like that at all. However, here's why you're running this place entirely wrong because I've been inconvenienced."""
I definitely do not miss retail.  
How the fuck did the bounty hunter find the house?
"Yeah. some hunter pulled this with my mother once. Wanted to argue with her that he had permission to be there, even though it was her own property, and she knew where the lines were. "
"Until I started in retail, I couldn't believe the amount of people that will literally throw their money at you (most of the time they've given too much), or hold a hand full of change out for me (the cashier) to count. Then stare at you like they think you're going to rip them off.

And he actually complained about you using the word prorate? Sounds like he's annoyed that a ""lowly retail worker"" is smarter than he is."
My manager did step in and it understandably only made the customer even more annoyed. I never push that hard for a ‘yes’ from the customer bc I know how obnoxious it gets but I can’t afford to be in bad standing with my managers 
"Because 2-year-old children can read (and pay attention to) signs better than their mothers can, right?"
"Should've driven to another spot thirty feet away. She'd have followed, and then you repeat until she gives up. Try to make it far enough to be a burden, but short enough that you know she'll follow because she's a bitch. The goal is to get her all the way across the parking lot, and then zoom back leaving her there. "
"In tech support the number one rule is that users lie.  Maybe not intentionally, but tech support people assume that the user is lying and never take a users claim on faith.

I wonder if there should be something similar for retail"
"I love this version of these stories.  Although the favorite one that's happened to me was the other way around.  I was doing some shooting on public land, and a police officer stopped by.

""Do you know who's property this is?""

""Yes sir, BLM""

""Oh.... uhhh... You're the first person who's ever gotten that right!  Have a good day!"""
"Well, the silver lining is that someone raised that kid well. It could technically have been the mom; people have off days."
"If she didn't know her daughter's size, the minute she heard it was final sale she shouldn't have continued. She could have asked if you could hold them until she was able to speak with her daughter, or she could have come back later with her daughter. But she chose to buy them knowing there was a chance her money would be wasted. She made that choice, she needs to live with it."
"Got one better, My last job was a large retailer of automotive products.

Had a customer come in over an alternator that was ""chinese junk"" because she had had to replace it once every week for the last 3 weeks and that she wanted a refund

&amp;#x200B;

Well I go through the trouble of explaining a LIMITED lifetime warranty to her, and why since she sold the car the warranty doesn't apply.

&amp;#x200B;

""But it's UNDER WARRANTY"" 

Ma'am if you will kindly flip your contract over it tells you the ins and outs of how our warranty works.

""I just want my money back, you are refusing to service me""

Alright I'll humor you, I'll REPLACE the alternator, ONE MORE TIME, but ONLY if it is done by an ASE certified shop and not bubba the mechanic down the street...and thats really going above what the company tells me to do.

&amp;#x200B;

""Well I sold the car because I wrecked it""

So you no longer have the vehicle?

She gave me this smug look that made me want to force feed her some 40 weight...

""Nope"" she said with a smile...

&amp;#x200B;

Oh that makes this easy then, No refund...Enjoy your paper weight.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

&amp;#x200B;

I'M GONNA SUE...

As luck would have it our legal team was doing some paper work in the back for the end of the year and they all heard it, one of em snickered a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ma'am, are you sure you want to sue? Keep in mind this will be an official statement""

&amp;#x200B;

""Did I fucking stutter?""

She wasn't even looking at them, didn't see their name tags, and their evil evil smiles.

""Can you wait a moment miss?""

Yes I Ca....She looked up to the faces of 6 well dressed corporate lawyers...All of them wearing her former smug look...only there was a hint of malice to it.

&amp;#x200B;

One of them came back and handed her a document...

They made an official document..

Filed it with the county...

&amp;#x200B;

Their last words to her were ""Then we will see you in court, I suggest you hire a good lawyer, and we hereby legally ban you from this establishment, and any others that share the name.

&amp;#x200B;

Good day ma'am.

&amp;#x200B;

That was about 2 years ago, Never really found out what happened other than a blurb about our lawyers getting new desks."
"&gt; TL;DR Woman comes in with a flat tire, doesn't understand the concept of other customers being in line before her.


That's because it wasn't her fault!"
"The game store I frequent has one that says ""taught to play Magic"" which is probably worse"
"Happens at the bank all the time. If people are in front of the doors when we are trying to come in we cant even enter the branch. We have to call the police to ask them to move because it's too much of a risk to the staff to go up to a car themselves. You know, armed robberies and stuff."
Thank you for making her pay and take responsibility. At big chain stores in America we aren’t allowed to do that anymore.
"She didn't want to buy clothes, she wanted the dopamine rush that comes from buying stuff when its on a good sale"
Even ignoring that. The bounty hunter is just straight up breaking the law. (Used to be one) we can’t break down an associates door. Only time we can do that is if we knew for a fact that the person were going after  was in there. (And even then we tried to not do that.) 
I hope he realizes how BAD this is.
Should have told her that the white part comes with it for free. Customers love free stuff lol 
"You never know. Lots of great people have been raised by terrible parents, and lots of terrible people grew up with incredible parents. Let's not forget to give that girl credit for choosing to stand up to her mom, regardless of her situation."
"Well that's something that's probably never been said by a human being before: ""James Taylor's music is too aggressive"". "
"I’m so glad the daughter stood up to her mum. People have no idea how terrifying it is knowing food can potentially kill your child. 


Children with allergies miss out on a lot of stuff, they know they do and it’s sad. They deserve to be able to be included. I don’t understand how people can see allergies as a weakness or a fad. "
"Apparently two drunk girls locked themselves into a supply closet a week or so ago thinking it was a bathroom. :/

Also, I agree with the whole thing about people getting behind our desks and registers. About a year ago now, I was in one of the stores with a coworker, and this Brazilian lady asked about a fitting room. We didn't have one in that store. Know what she did? She grabbed a towel and held it up around her two boys so they could ""try on"" some swim trunks.

They came up to buy a minute later, but they had ink tags on the trunks. My coworker tried to say they had to be taken off to get the inktags off. This bitch then decides to SHOVE my coworker out of the way, walk BEHIND the register, and take the tags off herself. I'm watching this happen, and my coworker and I are both just standing there with expressions like ""Did she really just do that?"" As soon as she pays and leaves, I walk up to him and confirm that I wasn't seeing things.

And yes, she left the towel unfolded on a far away shelf."
I once had a customer bring a bottle water to the counter at the coffee shop i worked at and ask....how am i supposed to drink this.   I still giggle when I remember that moment. 
"I was in line at a grocery store today. The guy in front of me had $66 showing due, and put 4 twenties on the counter. 


The clerk asked if the customer had a rewards card. When the customer said no, the clerk picked up a new card from a stack he had set out,   and swiped it. 

We all watched as the display went from $66 to $56. 

The clerk turned to the customer, and asked ""You want to keep it?"" as he offered the card. 

The customer said ""Sure,"" and took the card.

I told the clerk I was impressed after the customer left. "
"I agree, but unfortunately our companies philosophy is ""Needs of the customers first."" Even our GM is a slave to what the customers say about it. For reference, we're one of those chains that have a ""secret shopper"" and the standards we have to meet to get a decent customer service score are ridiculous."
"I mean, even if he was, breaking in and attacking him would still be SUPER illegal "
i hope your manager was observant enough to realize his pressuring was what made the customer even more irate.
Ugh. Just. Just *ugh*. Retail workers don't get paid nearly enough for this garbage. I wish you could've sent a nice note along saying next time he should bring his own candy.
