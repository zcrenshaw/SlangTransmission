"I too work in the seafood department. I have a slight clarification for anyone else reading. Argentinian shrimp are red/pink when they are raw, so they kinda look like cooked shrimp but in no way feel like cooked shrimp. I have to remind people that they are still raw all the time. "
"I don't know what it is about this story in particular, out of all the stories I've ever read on this subreddit, but this one absolutely boils my piss.


What a horrible bitch. With a personality like that, I bet her grandson hates her anyway."
Not even a thanks. Why am I not surprised?
Oh this is horrible **munches away** Just awful! **shoving fists full of raw shrimp down gullet** How can anyone eat this?! **chewing noises**
Really i think the issue is your coworker. He expects it for free beacuse he sometimes can get it for free. You need to get your cowowrker to cut it out its making your life harder.
"Yup.. I think the reason why I remember it so well is that it wasn’t a mess up or just ignorance, she obviously knew exactly what she did and how wrong it was but she didn’t care. Sometimes the employee have to pay for the thing in these situations and she still did it. "
The story has a certain appeal. 
"THIS is key info, thank you."
"I've had someone in person do the same with soap. Refused to specify the type. Insulted my intelligence. ""Soap for washing! Why do they hire idiots like you?""  So I took him to car soap, which was all the way on the opposite side of the store. When that wasn't what he wanted I asked again ""What kind of soap then?""  "
"Here's the thing though: blood is a biohazard. And while other customers have only a very small chance of catching anything from the blood he spilled, there's still a chance. What you did was taking care of the biohazard as quickly as possible, and a bathroom floor can be bleached to kill any germs, while a carpet is harder to clean, and other customers may have walked on it with bare feet (with possibly open scratches or cuts) during that time. So I think what you did was in the right."
"I'm sorry ossifer, but the propane at the lady store wouldn't come to me, so I had to go to them. That's why I was drunking drive."
"Recently had a client call and ask for a broker. Not any one type specifically, just a broker. Well, how am I supposed to know what you want? There are real estate brokers, mortgage brokers, investment brokers. This is a bank, we have a lot of options. J asked her if she was looking for a mortgage rep or something and she just went, ""no. A B.R.O.K.E.R.""

Okay. I'll just pick one and hope for the worst."
"I wouldn’t have given them anything. You’re closed, you owe them nothing. They could’ve called ahead. "
"I don't expect anyone to become an expert in another language overnight, but when you're in someone else's country, it's not good manners to expect them to speak your language without you doing your best to speak theirs.(You don't have to be perfect, just do your best and people are usually patient, as was my experience in Germany) You did the absolute best thing, which was using the iPad to translate, and she refused. She caused all of her own problems, and she didn't deserve a discount for how rude, demanding, and downright impossible she was being."
"Managers are too soft. They still believe in the whole ""the customer is always right"" thing when that is never true. I used to hate that in retail. Get mad? Have it for free."

"How dense do you have to be to not know the difference between a gas station gift card managed by that gas station, and a bank credit card managed by that bank? I'm scared to ask how she even got a credit card in the first place....."
"So, by his logic, I could take a book by a known author, let's say Alastair Reynolds for sake of the argument, change the characters, and viola! I'm an author.

Yeah, I don't think that's going to get me on the New York Times bestsellers list.

Also, I doubt anyone will buy a crappy, bad knockoff of a low resolution graphic for the probably inflated prices he'll sell them for when they could buy the original, professionally done, from you. "
Because they think they’re special. And they’re old.  
These two are meant to be together
"George Carlin's comment is very apt for this customer. 

""Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize half of them are stupider than that.""
"
"I always say to these people (jokingly of course) « would you like a bag for your bag? » the answer is always no, with a laugh."
Forcing an employee to pay for a mistake is illegal in lots of places
"Fear of embarrassment most likely, pride. "
"I mean, it's not like thousands of pigs died on the hog farms or having the hog farms flooded out may have slowed down distribution. No, you're purposefully keeping the pork in the back of the store since you're lazy. 

Some people are so dense it's unbelievable. "
"&gt; I'm scared to ask how she even got a credit card in the first place.....

She's the type of consumer that credit card companies love.

"LOL he kinda had a deer in the headlights look for like 4 seconds. Then his face turns red and he busts up laughing and saying he can’t believe that he thought that were already cooked lol. I explained that raw Argentinian wild shrimp has that pinkish color so it’s understandable. He said, “Well let me try to cook them and I’ll let you know how they are next time I come in!” Lol. The next week after cooking them, he did like them! "
Did she pass the ID test being a nine year old?  WHHYY???? 
"A merry tour of the store ensues as we visit dish soap, laundry detergent, etc..."
"Well, the hurricane was named 'Florence', and Flor sounds like pork, while rence stands for remove every nice chop enthusiastically, and 'hurricane' has hurry in it, so obviously, it's code for hurry up and hide all of the pork. I'm pretty sure aliens are involved too. That's why the hurricane is a spiraly thing, it has to do with gamma ray rotation.

(Or something like that?)

Edit: spelling"
"Yeah if it was up to me, same! I hate when complainers get their way by complaining lol it isn't right. "
"I had said ""I'm pretty sure theres nothing I can do for you, as we ARE closed on Sundays?? I can call my manager??""  

So I sent them off for their tan, called my manager who agreed this was a very very silly thing to be pissed off about but told me to tell them: ""Listen, we don't HAVE to do this, but to be nice we will credit you a free tan on your next visit, but this is a one time thing""

When I told the man he said ""Well thats all we wanted, its only fair!""

I WANTED to say ""No it isn't but okay!"" But instead I just forced a smile until they left lol "
"I hear insurance brokers are *always* looking to help new customers. She was probably after life insurance.

Did you send her to buy life insurance?

Hey, speaking of which, do you have life insurance? Life insurance can help your family save *hundreds of thousands of dollars* in funeral costs and other expenses in the event of your untimely death. Don't leave your loved ones burdened with that in an already difficult time, do the right thing *for them* and call www.1-800-take-my-money.com now!"
No no no no fuck them they get NOTHING their prize is EMPTY that is NOT how this story goes
"There is a line between giving in to get the crazy out of the store, but all your manager did was make this an ongoing thing. They will be back at the next clearance, and will be shouting **IT WAS 50% off the clearance price last time!!!**"
"I do agree, the thing is though most people with common sense would understand that if you have a good relationship with one server that gives you something free once in a while, doesnt automatically mean everyone there will do it. Most people understand this, old guy evidently did not. "
"I am sure that's how he thinks authorship works too. We deal with people trying to sell crappy low res knock offs of our stuff all the time, someone emailing us to brag about their plans to make a knock off doesn't happen every day though. The absurdity was really in that he felt like he was the one being ""wronged"" in this scenario. "
"The proper answer to any question involving ""Why..."" is ""because corporate  said so and the computer makes me do it"""
"""But... we stole a banana!""

""Yeah... on free banana day..."""
