"I don't want to use a negative word, so I'll take a completely neutral word and *make* it negative.

Great logic right there."
"Says she‚Äôs being treated like a criminal even though she isn‚Äôt being treated like a criminal even though she is a criminal. 

It‚Äôs a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma!"
"Stupid comparison but I have this problem with my 3 1/2 month old kitten, except the opposite. He loves ham, so whenever I have ham I call his name 'Gage!' 'Gage!' But I guess the only time I was calling him was for ham. So, now he thinks Gage means ham, so whenever I call him for pets he just gets disappointed there's no ham and leaves. üòí"
"Many years ago I worked at Blockbuster, and we had a promotion one summer where if you donated $1 to Children's Miracle Network, you got one free family/kids movie rental per day, M-F, for the entire summer.

Now movie rentals were more than $1 each, so every person who went to rent a kids/family movie got the deal, but occasionally people would start to bicker.  I remember one time I told a guy ""Look, this rental is $4.50, the charity donation is $1.  I'm going to scan the barcode on this piece of paper, you're going to give me $1, and you get your movie rental.  You also get free movie rentals for the summer of the summer with this piece of paper, but honestly you could tear it up and eat it and you would still be saving $3.50 right now.""

Some people just assume you're trying to screw them over."
"Why did you even bother to ring her up? Just let her come up to the counter, then tell her ""we closed 10 minutes ago, you'll have to come back tomorrow"", maybe then she'll get the message"
"I didn't read this right the first time over, and skipped that it was about a kitten, and read year instead of month. In my head you had a toddler that loves ham so much he thought his name meant ham. It was a very funny story that way, but I was confused.

When I reread it slower, it was a very cute story. But that mental image of a toddler coming running for ham was hilarious to me."
That's where vidalia onions are from.
Are you in Georgia?  Why would you know anything about onions?
"I make a point of teaching customers at self-scan how to do things rather than doing it for them. It takes longer, and I can't say I always stick to my guns when things get hectic but it reinforces it's self-scan not a full service lane. Usually though people use the excuse of not knowing how (so they can't really complain when I teach them how) rather than just straight up admitting they expect full service at the self-scan."
"But you're an employee, and everyone knows they know the location of every potential customer down to the coordinate!"
I expected a bad ending but this was so wholesome and cute
"&gt;honestly you could tear it up and eat it and you would still be saving $3.50 right now.

That's such a fantastically hilarious way to make your point, vent your frustration, and still be ""professional""."
Possible dementia? Older person.
"But...words have the meanings and connotations we ascribe to them. Isn't she just transferring all the negativity from the word no onto the word octopus for her kid? And what happens when this kid goes to school? Is she going to insist the teachers to along with this? ""There will be octopus talking during the test""..."
"‚Äú...You‚Äôre treating me like a criminal.‚Äù

That‚Äôs because you are exactly that!"
I tried to explain to him while we waited on the manager how gas pricing is relative to the area it's being sold in and has nothing to do with the price at each sister store. He just kept going on about how it had to be a mistake on our end and he should get it cheaper lol
"Free entertainment, lol"
"Learn from this. That was 100% deliberate. I've had people yell at me to distract me, to try and pressure me into giving them what they want, and to try and intimidate me so that I won't research what their problem is and find out they are lying. That woman was probably sociopathic to some degree and she knew what she was doing. Not your fault - I've had to explain this tactic to many employees."
I actually am. Why?
I didn't but my cashier did. I should have stopped her but i was waiting for the police to show up so I can unlock the door.
"I'm confused,  these come with a charging cable and have buttons.  How could you confuse one with real lip gloss?"
This definitely sounds like dementia. I had an elderly relative with Alzheimer's and money became more and more impossible for him. It was one of the early signs.
It's like that famous story of the guy who had the cops called on him for using a 2 dollar bill.
"Right, teens can be dumb but not that dumb. Probably she zapped herself on a dare (many teens are dumb enough to do *that*) and parents caught her so she made up the story about confusing it for lip gloss."
I like D&amp;D! Wanna see some D&amp;D memes?
"We have a regular customer who knows damn well we close at 9pm. She will come in at like 8:40 with several bags of items to return, and leave them at the counter to find other items to exchange them for. Every time, without fail, she will continue to browse until we've reminded her at least twice that it's 9 and we're closed. Then she will bring her mountain of new items to the register. Processing the return while she browses would expedite this process, but she won't have it. She has to go through and sort all the old items to make sure she really doesn't want them. Then she sorts the new items to make sure she really does want them. Rinse and repeat for 2 or 3 nights in a row. And the best part? She apologizes profusely through the entire ordeal. ""I'm so sorry, i know I'm a pain in the ass!"" Lady, if you were sorry you wouldn't have turned this into a hobby."
"Now I feel kinda bad about it because what you‚Äôre saying seems like a real possibility. At the time though, I was shook."
"Ahhh okay! I actually didn‚Äôt know that, I live closer to the Tennessee line though, that may be one reason why."
Yikes. She sounds like she had some serious mental issues. Demanding to know why it's one chain instead of another is the kind of thing my 3-year-old would ask.
How dare you do your work instead of being on the lookout for tiny customers
"She is a criminal, so no matter how she is treated, she is being treated like a criminal, as evidenced by the fact that under identical circumstances, a criminal (her) was treated exactly the same way.

After that, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate!"
"I'm gonna be laughing at that ""logic"" all day. Reminds me of a time a coworker and I went on lunch and had the most absurd experience trying to give someone directions.

Driver: ""Excuses me, can you tell me, where is George St?""

Me: ""You're on it, sir. This is George St.""

Driver: ""Yes, ok, but where is George St?""

Coworker: ""Sir, this street right here? The one you're driving on? This IS George St. What's the address you're looking for?""

Driver: ""No, I am LOOKING for George St. Where is George St?""

Me: ""You're on it!"" 

Driver: ""Yes, I know, but where-""

Coworker: ""Ok dude, go down to blocks to the traffic light, make a right, go up two blocks, make another right. Then go down two blocks, make another right and you'll be on George."" 

Driver: ""Thank you! Have a good day!!"""
"I know I have trained myself to just say no every time a cashiers asks me to donate - I hate being pressured to donate when I just want to get out with my gallon of milk.

But jeez, if I am going in specifically for a sale/price reduction, I will make myself aware of the procedure to get it and follow that."
"There was a similar TIFU a while back ago.

Kid got upset (crying) when parents said ""no"". Just a sensitive kid. So they started saying ""n word"" for ""no""... literally the phrase ""n word"".

Parents get called into school. Kid told teacher that her parents used ""the n word"" all the time at home."
"Describe Vidalia onions? Sure, ""4159."""
She would explode in the U.S. where we pay sales tax on top of the listed price.
"How dare you accuse her of doing exactly what she did?? Dont you know that she is a customer and the customer is always right?

Oh God, I cant believe those words came out of my mouth."
Why stop there. Why not substitute the letter N for octo and the letter O for pus. That shpusuld make life a little bit more ioctoterestioctog aoctod I caocto't wait tpus see the pepusples faces
Im in indiana and i know about Vidalia onions.... Couldnt really deacribe them in anyway other than theyre supposed to be extra sweet. Ive heard of people eating them like an apple
"""Does this work how I think it does?""

""No, actually it works like this.""

""You're lying! It must work how I think it does!"""
