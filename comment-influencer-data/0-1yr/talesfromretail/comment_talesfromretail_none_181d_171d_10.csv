"I have had a lady do this to me too, she apologised and said it was because she could no longer see the numbers even with glasses, and did not have the dexterity left to take out her card or press the buttons. Made me sad for a few minutes until I forgot about it. "
People are surprised when I tell them I am 22 or if they see me with my three month old they are surprised I have a two year old at home too. Apparently I look like 16
You were absolutely right in refusing the sale despite the age misstep.
some people just want to be angry for no reason.
I think YOU might wanna lay off the booze for the night lnao
"I mean, the data is probably is being stored and sold."
"man, this could be inspiration for an r/nosleep story.  
"
"This is Australia, right? I have seen way too many Woolies employees screamed at for 15c bags, It‚Äôs been what, 8-9 months now? How are people still so useless at the concept of ‚ÄòBYO‚Äô?! No one bats an eye when you have to bring your own booze somewhere, but ‚Äúshit don‚Äôt make me remember to bring my own shopping bags‚Äù *facepalm*"
"If it's the same company i'm thinking of, I also happen to work there. It tends to be a lot of elderly/middle class people. "
"Sometimes when you're seeing red, you dont think straight. Plus I thought a free burger would at least shut him up. "
"Perhaps. Matches the description. If so, hi there colleague!"
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
Yay thanks 
"I since called a work order in rather than sending it on the computer. The person asked, ""What do you mean the door needs to be fixed.""  


""I mean...the door does not close at all, therefore...it needs to be fixed so that NEXT time I go wheeling into my receiving area, I do not find a person urinating in the corner to mark their territory. I used a \_gallon\_ of store used bleach on that, and threw an entire power panel into damages. That single urination cost the store $88.50.""

&amp;#x200B;

They have since sent people to fix the door, but apparently nobody can understand how to fix a door that needs its door jamb replaced. Let's keep fighting with the old door jamb and trying to make it work. So...on the bright side, the company finally took my work order seriously. On the downside, there's still a real risk of repeat urination."
You guys anime protagonists or something?
Why was it removed?
That is arguably the most wholesome thing I have ever read on this entire website. We should all aspire to be more like that kid.

As in literally three fries. 
"Personally, I think they're huffing the gasoline...     

Of course the cigs are more expensive on a gas station. Everything else is, so why not those, too.    

(Here in Norway, gas stations typically get 1 - 2% of the gas price, so they need to get their income somewhere else)    "
You obviously don't know where you are. 
"The incident shut down Verruckt completely. I mean, it should be shut down, it was way too tall of a water slide "
"Texaco, if they are still around."
I think you should have served her only three fries. What a horrible costumer!

I worked in a homebrew shop for a few years. Best time ever! 
I read the first headline and was like ummmm üòÇ
"Thanks for answering my question, hope you have an awesome day Xpialidocious (love your username). "
The company is Dutch/British. The ‚ÄúShell‚Äù part of the Royal Dutch Shell name is the British trading company that merged with the Dutch oil company. 
Call them out on it!
Lol yeah i can‚Äôt imagine taking that much in at one time. Probably enough to kill a grown bear.
"It makes me mad when managers don‚Äôt support their staff anyway, and like I guess the burger comment could‚Äôve been plausible for him to believe, but AT WHAT POINT WOULD SOMEONE ONLY SERVE 3 FRIES?! Like even the worst of the worst in food industry wouldn‚Äôt just serve 3? How tf did she get away with that?"
"Dang, you‚Äôre a good writer. Upvote"
"Oh god the classic ‚ÄúI came from half an hour away!‚Äù When I get this I‚Äôm always tempted to let them know there‚Äôs employees here commuting twice that, twice a day. Gah! "
"&gt; I assume all the largest chains here are US owned

"My dad was 50 and married to a 22 year old when I was 17. 

Parent-teacher conferences were awkward because she had my same teachers just a few years prior..."
"So maybe I'm misunderstanding, but why do you guys print coupons if your system automatically applies discounts? (Unless this was a manufacturer's coupon)"
Same
"none of the coupons are printed, some discounts just come from buying specific items together, some are on the customers phone as a QR code. "
"I feel like she might have missed where you said you were closed for maintenance.  Doesn‚Äôt excuse her stupidity, but at least it‚Äôs a different kind of stupid."
"One fish, two fish. Free fish, more fish.

Hangovers are a hell of a thing
"My dad has always been a bring-your-own bag guy, well before cities in the US started banning plastic or charging for store ones. I remember going to the grocery store with him when I was a teenager in the '90s and it would take like three employees to understand that we just wanted to re-use the paper bags we had from a previous trip. Like, the store logo would be stamped on it, but someone would have to call the manager because they would all be so confused.  "
I too worked in the gas station at a stop and shop (I‚Äôm assuming because Shell accepts their points) and boy do I feel your pain.
"LOL, true, I suppose. I don't mind thieves getting caught. If they do, I hope I'm in the vicinity so I can snicker."
It‚Äôs the age that the company put for us. Probably because the use of weapons and extreme amount of violence?
"I probably said it wrong, I didn't look up the quote up to make sure it was accurate. But hey, you got it, so it worked"
"Not weird at all to card everyone. I used to work for a small store that sold cigarettes but didn't have the alcohol license yet, and we had to do a video course on IDing before we were allowed to touch the tobacco cabinet. Specifically told to card everyone, regardless of if they ""looked old enough"". I had so many old men berate me for carding them because I didn't want to lose my job and knew my manager was watching me on the security feed. You're just covering your own ass, ignore anyone who wants to fight it."
