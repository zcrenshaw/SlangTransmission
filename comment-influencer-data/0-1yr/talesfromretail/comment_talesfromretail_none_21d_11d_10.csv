"Worked restaurant management for years. I've seen almost every permutation of this. People suck. My favorite and most satisfying interaction was with a woman who had walked in after hours expected to be seated and served. I basically shut her down, telling her that every piece of equipment in our kitchen had been shut down and is in the process of being cleaned. We had closed 10 minutes before, so this was normal. 

After all of her cajoling and harrumphing and me not budging on the fact that we were closed she uttered my favorite phrase from these people; ""What ever happened to the customer is always right?!?"" I replied with ""It was a thing in the 90s, then people like you ruined it for the rest of us. We're closed, have a nice night.""

Her jaw hit her chest and I got a sweet, sweet ""WELL I NEVER!!!"" in the Karen voice you hear every so often and started for the front. I followed to secure the door and replied, ""Well, if you mean 'been courteous to those who help you' you should try it. You might have better luck. Have a good evening."" Then locked the door on her."
"It didn't even originally mean what people think it means, it was the idea that to be successful you should be selling the products that the customer wants to buy rather than selling the products that the customer should buy, it doesn't mean you should bend over backwards for every demanding customer"
"If you work customer service you are there to service, not to serve.  There is a big difference.  Anybody who thinks that customer service workers exist to serve them, regardless of the context, needs a reality check."
"Literally, same thing happened to me last Sunday. We closed at 6pm. (I shut everything down around 6:10pm.) Announcements were made, signs are up, all the lights are out, music and displays are off. There is no indication of being open, at this point. I closed our store after a usual walkthrough while other associates were still tidying up. A few minutes after already putting away registers, here comes a disgruntled Karen to the register trying to check out with her kid. I gave the same speech, politely. Needless to say, she was irate and left inaccurate and false reviews just to make us/myself look unprofessional. Totally hate people, sometimes."
"It was a thing in the 1890s. Lol.

Good job, you!!!"
"""No, I'm just here for money and they stopped paying me 15 minutes ago. Good luck, though."""
This sub makes it seem like not everyone does.
I've found that for some people anyone working in the service industry isn't a real person. I guess it's because we're there for them due to our job description in their self centered myopic opinion we have to be there for them at every moment of the day. Business hours are for peasants...
Damn girl you spicy
"It would have been so funny if you had locked up the store with her still in there. 
Then she would be trespassing."
"""While you may be hoping I'm a mind reader, Ma'am, the problem is that there would have to be a mind for me to read."""
"I'm so glad that my time in retail was before internet reviews.

Sorry you had to deal with that."
Have you actually read the rules of the sub?
"Thank is. And me, too. We watched the cameras and her and her son were hiding out in the fitting rooms. Not sure if intentional, but nobody called out after we asked if the store was empty or when the lights were out. Lol oh, well. Too bad so sad."
"Yes, but one can offer service and serve with the expectation that he/she will be treated with respect, not like a servant."
Yep. Simple supply and demand economics. It’s a shame that even simple concepts elude some people.
Not after 9pm. Please leave.
Try it sometime
"I'm lucky, my job title is Customer Advisor, so I can get away with ""advising"" a customer that the store is closed, and we can't process their transaction."
I nominate you for president of the United States
"It's only absurd in certain fields. If a customer buys a sandwich from my restaurant, then comments that the tomatoes taste off, I don't care what the label says--maybe their tongue is more sensitive to rot than mine. If it's the first dish of the morning and I just prepped all the food, myself, from scratch, and someone complains... *then* it's a stupid Karen trying to get a free meal. 

The idea behind the concept will always have a hint of truth in food service, but people's misinterpretations of it have resulted in all complaints being held suspect due to a rise in dishonest customers."
"Nice.  Lately my comebacks are, ""No, you are."" Somehow I turned 6."
"&gt;""The customer is always right"" was *never* about doing whatever the customer wants

Gotta play Devil's advocate here, [it was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right).

&gt;""Variations include ""le client n'a jamais tort"" (the customer is never wrong) which was the slogan of hotelier César Ritz who said, ""If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked"". A variation frequently used in Germany is ""der Kunde ist König"" (the customer is king), while in Japan the motto ""okyakusama wa kamisama desu"" (お客様は神様です) meaning ""the customer is a god"", is common.

 

&gt;and even if it was that's an absurd policy.

But at least they caught on quick! 

&gt;However it was pointed out as early as 1914 that this view ignores that customers can be dishonest, have unrealistic expectations, and/or try to misuse a product in ways that void the guarantee."
"""I will always serve those that are worthy, you are not"""
"For some reason, people like that Karen never want to hear a long explanation of how ""The customer is always right"" was *never* about doing whatever the customer wants, and even if it was that's an absurd policy."
"I have been informed that I have ""a sharp wit and fast tongue"".    Sarcasm is just one of the services I offer, but I can tell you, I have gotten myself in hot water for blurting out lines like, usually at people that deserve them."
The name of the store wasn't relevant to the story.
"*For those who can't read it because of formatting...*

On a warm summer night a group of teenagers  came to the store,  since it was the middle of the night and they had nothing better to do.

The first thing they do was to grab all of the motorized handicap carts. They went racing thought the store, angering all of the employees  they went past. They  drew the attention of store security as well. 

After a while they grew bored of their game and abandoned the carts scattering them thought out the store."
"We recently had a power outage. Manager on shift didn’t know at first how to close the automatic doors at the entrance, who open automatically in case of an emergency when we need to evacuate. 

We blocked the entrance with carts and a movable clothing rack and put a sign up that were closed because of the outage. 

People still came in. 
“Oh I’ll use the flashlight on my phone and pay cash.”

Yeah as a safety measure, even employees are not allowed back in until the problem is solved. 
But sure. Shop away."
"i used to work in a place that insisted on being posh and calling them guests not customers. my last week I had a ""karen"" demand something that was not happening and popped off ""the customer is always right"". I took great delight in saying ""yes but you are a guest and guests are sometimes wrong"""
Another good one.  I'm not very good with comebacks!
"Haha, yeah that would have been funny.  But I was just a salesperson and didn't have that power!"
"After over 20 years in different retail jobs, I could write a book of blatant shopliftings.  My wife still works retail, and the list of stories are still growing.  Some from the ""Don't even pretend, they're straight up stealing"", to ""I think they can't see the really obvious way I'm stealing.""

First one happened my first day in retail.  I was getting carts from the parking lot, when suddenly I see two women sprinting towards me, carrying one case of really cheap pop (soda).  When the pass me, I see them jump into a car waiting with a man, who then drives backwards out of the parking lot, so I couldn't get his plate.  This happened 24 years ago, in a state that confiscates cars used for shoplifting.  One woman lost her shoes, and they risked losing their car for a $5 case of Sam's pop.  Unless they stoled the shoes too, they lost money.  Manager checked the camera, the women walked in only far enough to grab the pop from a display, and run out."
"Nope, you are repeating wishful thinking. Read the Wikipedia page on it."
"But I got them here last week!

Sir, we haven't had them for a week, we got them yesterday. 

Are you calling me a liar?? Get me your manager now!"
"You must have taken the sign away!!
  Sir, there was never a pond freezer
I'm calling corporate, you can't treat me like this, I'm a customer !!!"
"Oh, you couldn’t even imagine."
