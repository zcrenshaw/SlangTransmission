"Oh yeah they stole from the 1 euro store I was working at. When caught you had to pay a 50 euro fine. For something that costs 1 euro, it's pretty stupid on principle to steal and then pay 50 instead but you know, what goes through their head is a mystery."
"&gt;it's pretty stupid on principle to steal and then pay 50 instead

You realise the idea of thieving is to not get caught, right? So, the 50 isn't guaranteed. Therefore they aren't thieving just to ""pay 50 instead"""
"I too hate thieves. This warms my cold, shriveled heart"
I'm 51.  Apparently I'm old.  I am sad now.
OP said the old man hates *fucking* thieves. He may still like them
"Can confirm, work retail for years and people steal all kinds of things."
"I swear, all apologies get you in customer service is more headaches, time, and money. Don't give them a reason to think you're sorry and they're not going to doubt you."
Kids born after Y2K can vote now.
"My 3 and 5 year old pick stuff up off the floor at stores and hang stuff back up. I love using them to make people feel bad, like when someone knocks something over and doesnt pick it up, my kids race to do it and we talk about it.
""Great job picking that up honey! When we see something on the floor, we pick it up""
Now they talk about how adults don't put stuff back where it belongs and that they should know better haha"
That family should be banned from your establishment.
"As much entertainment I get from ""the chase"" of  a shop lifter, I was not hired to do security. I am not a cop or a guard, and frankly at close to bare minimum wage I do not care enough to risk any part of my well being to take back some shoes. When I get some authority, benefits and a predictable, stable schedule them maybe I'll care."
Yep you're old üßì
This dude rocks
Hate to say but cops don't care about this.
"A study back in the 1960s found the Bushmen of the Kalahari - one of the last few hunter-gatherer societies - have figured out a way to work only about 15 hours each week acquiring food and then another 15 to 20 hours on domestic chores. The rest of the time they could relax and focus on family, friends and hobbies. Based on the archaeological record, this is typical of the first couple hundred thousand years of human existence. While some people have worked to address the consequences population boom - a result of industrialization - that has led to mass poverty, disease, and starvation within this system, the system still has far and away had as its greatest consequence an acceleration in the disparity between the wealthiest one percent and [everyone else.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth#/media/File:Share_of_wealth_globally.png)"
"She made the comment because her life hit a point, probably in her 40's where she realized she was trapped in a loveless marriage, with children who resented her, a job that brought her no joy, and her own insecurities staring her back in the face every morning?  Or she's just an ignorant old biiiiiitch who nobody likes.  Asking for a friend üò≠"
FUCK
"Fucking hell, that poor guy!  Did nothing wrong and now he's out whatever he paid because somebody didn't look hard enough?  Yeesh.  At least they didn't blame him for it, that's some consolation I guess."
"My very first Black Friday shopping adventure involved a store selling Fleece tops for $5 each and if you were one of the first in line and spent $40+ you got an waterproof digital camera for free. The ad *clearly* stated that they would be handing out wristbands for the camera, no wristband, no camera. So, needing small gifts for 12 kids, I took my naive self down to wait in line nearly 3 hours early to make sure I got my wristband.

Of course many, many people didn't read the not so fine print and rushed into the store the second the doors opened, grabbed enough random crap to get the magic amount (fully intending to return it all later, sans camera) and hit the register. I could hear them screaming from the back of the store. I took great pleasure in sauntering up to the front with my arms full of cheap and easy Christmas gifts and presenting my wristband to the cashier. I still use the camera for taking pics in and around water so I don't risk getting my phone  wet."
You don‚Äôt know a good thief is a thief.
"I used to tell my coworkers the same thing. I'm not getting hazard pay to potentially get stabbed for 12/hour. We lost an average of 96k/year through theft, but they cant pay a guard to hangout on a stool and walk around for 40-50k/year?"
Fun fact about me.  I can eat small amounts of cilantro and its delicious.  Large amounts taste like soap.  Makes me sad because the small amounts are so good
"Sometimes the benefit is not having to pay benefits. Personally, having 8 staff members full time, 2 part time, would be better than having 15 part time. 

I‚Äôve done shift work for most of my life and am incredibly upfront about needing full time hours if I‚Äôm promising full flexibility in schedule. Otherwise, I‚Äôd have to work two jobs, sometimes three. Work-life balance is important, but mutual respect between company and employee is more important.

Why should I care about their bottom line if they don‚Äôt care about mine?"
Then run over.  By a marching band.
"As someone who does eviction work before, yeah, we just use black trash bags and duct tape."
"A coworker fell off the *bottom* step of a stepladder while doing work on his bathroom. He knocked out several teeth (and drove one up into his upper jaw), broke his wrist, and need about two dozen stitches to sew his lip back on. And a mild concussion. The ER doctor told him he was lucky to be alive, and having seen the pictures (he's our literal poster child for ladder safety), nobody disputes it.

You'd want to check local laws for the actual sentence, but yeah, if I were on the jury, pushing someone off a ladder would most certainly qualify for felony assault."
"""I was in here 4 weeks ago, do you remember that one thing I got? Is it in stock somewhere?"""
"Yep. I was gonna say, this is a world where some people will as a grocery store employee, ""I'm looking for that snack that comes in a box or maybe a bag. I think it's Asian or maybe Mexican. It was like $2.99, or was it $5.99? I bought it last month, I don't remember exactly. It tasted really good and I want some more. Do you know what I'm talking about?"""
"They probably believe that they have the power to send in complaints that can be worded strongly enough to cause someone to lose their job, and would prefer to use this power as leverage to get whatever they want."
"I know, but they are pretty much guaranteed to get caught in our case. The camera is recording always, and there's always someone at the back watching. So.... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"That's awesome, great parenting skills! Thank you on behalf of probably all retail workers üëå"
"The first time I had someone commit return fraud (or whatever you call it when someone returns stolen items to get the refund), my boss explained to me what happened and it seemed like an awful lot of actual work to get that amount of money. They pick receipts out of trash cans and then steal what's on the receipt and try to return it with the receipt. From the loyalty account they used during the transaction, we could see they were making returns all over the city. Given that they're driving all over the place to do this and are intentionally making returns for items worth less than the limit that requires manager approval, I don't get how this pays more than working an actual job. Or why the hell somebody would run the risk of getting caught for a crime that pays within the amount they could get from working a legitimate job they could obtain that requires the same level of ""skills"" demonstrated by coming up with these schemes and executing them (they have to be able to work in a group successfully if they're being told what to do by someone else, or be intelligent enough to study these things and find out how to exploit them to commit theft)."

It is making me crazy that I don't understand this."
