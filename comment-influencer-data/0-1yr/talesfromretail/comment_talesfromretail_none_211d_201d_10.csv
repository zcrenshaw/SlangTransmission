Same and he was gonna pull out some Captain America ID out and try to say he fought in WW2 or something 
"Was her name Karen? 

I bet it was Karen"
I really hope this is the worst thing that happens to you all year.
UGH our system did exactly this too and customers would always be like “YOU FORGOT TO GIVE ME THE SALES” like yes i told the machine to ignore the sales specifically for you. lmaooo 
"*Pounds chest violently in face of baby kitty*

While I am sure it is a reddit popular opinion, I have not honestly noticed it said that much, so didn't actually 'know' for certain.  And the unpopular opinion tag mostly comes from habit of having to keep some sort of peace with my extended family(ies). I always throw out the disclaimer to them (and while at work, just in case) and I guess it translated to my post."
It seems a little ridiculous that there are only 2 people certified to use the forklift.
Was it an extra-loud ticking sound?  The gearshift(s) was/were probably not calibrated very well.
Where is tracey grimshaw when you need her
I'm not a cowman!  /s
"My grandparents have a mobile phone -- it can send SMS and make calls. A map, to them, is still something printed on paper."
"Yeah, that is one of the reasons I can't go back from using a smart phone. Get directions to any place on earth, and if there is a traffic incident we won't even tell you, we will just update the route, because you don't need to know.

That and podcasts..."
"&gt; Okay, I'll get this one at half price (a $40 book) and this one at full (a $20 book)

I tried this once... as a kid, on some cheapo earring sets.  I thought I was clever figuring out how to save the most money.  That's when I found out it never works that way and I have known that since.  I don't know how people like this lady make it to adulthood."
"Yeah, if your not even reading your receipt to check it over how do you know you even grabbed the right receipt? Oh wait maybe this explains why so many bozos come into our store and get angry we can't return something cause they brought the receipt from some random other store and thought it'd be fine."

Was expecting some guy to come in dressed as Cap for Halloween or something. Beanboozled.
"&gt; Customer: ""You're meant to address customers as Sir""

When dealing with military try this line: 

""The last guy got mad when I called him sir. Said he works for a living. Now I play it safe since I have no way to tell.""

The reason for this is in the military, only officers are addressed as ""sir"" and a lot of military folk get upset when you call them the wrong thing (which, as a vet myself, I find stupid as hell to bring to the civilian side of things, where ""sir"" is a common designation for any male you might ever encounter). 

It's not guaranteed to work, but it's shut them up 3/4 times. "
"It's rather elementary, if you put all the pieces together.

The sheer weight from the density of their brains makes time go relatively fast for them as opposed to the dullard viewer like you or myself.

You see, time is not a fixed aperture, it can be bent, and that appears to be the case in this instance."
"No definitely not. I know this will be a shock,  but he also did not sign up for the credit card when,  following policy,  I asked him again. "
I thought this was r/showercomebacks and I was worried you were gonna make a joke about her needing crutches. Very happy that didn't happen
"Back when I worked retail, I'd have spouses and children of military personnel trying to get a military discount."
"Friend worked at a sub shop that did not accept bills over $20.  Some guy tried to pay for a single sub with a $100 and started arguing when told they can't accept it.  Finally he yells, ""WELL HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW!  WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT!?""

"
"I don't get why they get so angry. Like nobody is forcing you to buy these products. If you want them cheaper, go to a discount or thrift shop, or order them online."

"I've literally never seen a BOGO sign without the ""equal or lesser value"" clause included. "
I feel like explaining sale signs to customers is 99% of my job lmao. Just open your eyes and READ people
"As if you, a cashier, have the ability or authority to reprogram how an entire corporate computer system processes transactions. "
"Damn, so what happened? Did he give up the address eventually?"
"Or deals in servos (gas station to you) where you save 4 cents a litre by sending $5 in the shop on chocolate. Like yeah, the 80 cents I save on fuel this trip definitely outweighs the overpriced 200g bar of Cadbury. "
"I've read ""umbrella"" so much here that it isn't even a discernable word to me at this point. "
Either that or they hope you haven’t read the sign yourself and know nothing about the sale so they can say whatever they want and you “have to” believe them. When that happens (whether by mistake or on purpose) I just ask the manager since there are sales that I don’t know about frequently but I still can’t take the customer’s word for it because a) they’re often wrong or have the wrong item for it and b) I don’t have authority to change the price. 
Although there are some cheaper ones listed on the same page for about $25.
Ha. That was hilarious. 
"I think we've all experienced that, reminds me of this comic I read a while back.

But why male models?
"I mean, I wont lie and say I've never had the stray intrusive thought.... "
r/murderedbywords
The stray thought of not wanting to kill someone is really quite jarring.
Oh no. I do this... I'm so sorry to the people I said this to. 
"Isn't an Umbrella umbrella very expensive for an umbrella? Like, you were literally paying for the Umbrella brand. And it is not even a real company."
"And at a book store, no less."
"Sure, I get it too. But is the customer really then doing it out of the goodness of their hearts or to get a tax deductible?"
"&gt;L: Okay, I'll get this one at half price (a $40 book) and this one at full (a $20 book)

Are they new to shopping? Is this their first day?"
Oh man she would probably explode if she was told this 
more like r/showercomebacks
"We don't take big bills at night because of threat of robbery, so I have a sign on the door and one at the register and people will still whip out the $100 for like a 75 cent Big Gulp."
