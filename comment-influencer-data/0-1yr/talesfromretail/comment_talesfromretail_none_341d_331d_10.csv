"Wow, talk about being detached from reality. "
"You: Turns around, rattles the locked door. ""Sorry, can't opener."" "
it's crystal clear— they made a methtake
"I never understood the people who think that we’ll just take their word for it. Like sure, here’s your free money, I trust you random lady."
"My sister and BIL had video of an employee stealing from the safe.

His response when confronted was that he would pay it back, they replied with the that the police had been called.

They owned a store in an area that had major worker shortages and this dude figured that he was safe because they needed staff. They didn't need them that badly."
"""Yes sir, we stole your phone to turn it off so you'd be mildly inconvenienced when you got it back. Never mind that battery life is finite and it may have turned off because of running out of power. It was DEFINITELY us that made the mistake here. Yes, please do bring in your goons and beat us up, Im' sure it'll make your manhood feel bigger next time you have a wank."""
Ask Management to check the cameras.  That will prove you are telling the truth.
"“We’re required to have you enter it due to the Patriot Act. Are you not a patriot, sir?”"
"So he was trying to get you to overload his truck so he could say you damaged the truck by knowing it couldn't handle that much weight, then try to say the costs are your fault?"
"You're sick, man."
"Oh, that's a lovely story :) "
"Ever since I left started my first retail job, I become more considerate for the hardships retail workers have to go through. I will put back clothes neatly and not just leave things a mess. I will try the best I can to NOT pick up products without barcodes (unless there is one left) to avoid issues.

Wow the situation you went through is the number 1 I never wanted to happen to me at retail. I'm so glad that I never accidentally hit cash before."
"If she wants it done for $5, she can go to the nearest supermarket and buy those iron on sheets that you can put through your printer. But, having used those often to design my own t-shirts as a kid, I can guarantee they won't be the same quality as a professionally printed shirt. Good quality costs money, and $20 for something that is going to last seems perfectly reasonable."
"I had a similar situation in which an employee stole an unknown amount of lotto cards but at least $300 worth. Those $25 tickets add up fast. When we confronted him he *offered* to pay it back out of his pay. Like seriously kid, you think we're going to keep you on after that??"
"I was a server and had a lady try to pay with a card type we didn’t accept and I had the same argument you had. I finally had enough and literally told her, “Look, I don’t care if your card works at (competitor restaurant), it doesn’t work here. Arguing won’t make it work and only wastes time. I either need a different card or cash or I can have the manager come out and tell you the same thing.”

Without another word, she pulled out cash. I don’t remember if I got a tip or not, but I assume not. 

Screw customer service jobs. "
"I do FBI background checks for people, taking all their info including fingerprints, but people still get weird about the social security number. "
"I'm honestly amazed she survived long enough to reach employment age if she's THAT unaware of how the world works.

Last minute customer on Christmas Eve? Those are some of the worst. They'll leave everything to the last possible time and then blame you for their poor planning and time management skills
"I found a phone on my way to the gym one day. It rang so I answered in the hopes I could get it back to the owner.

I was yelled at by the caller saying ""you stole my phone, you thief"". I eventually calmed them down and told them I found it and they could come and collect it once I'd finished at the gym.

When he collected it he was thankful but no apology for yelling at me. Some people are just nuts I guess"
"One of the girls at my job (non-retail) was told by another employee that they could get snacks from concessions for free while they were working. The only thing that’s free on shift is water bottles. 

She was caught on camera and was messaged by the area manager and said “someone told me the snacks were free. I’m sorry, I’ll pay for it when I come in for my next shift!” Luckily this girl is fairly new and, because of the other staff member, was told she could keep her job if she paid for it and told the managers who told her they were free. 

She told the area manager she didn’t know his name, but when she came in she told the store manager the guys name and what happened when he told her. Basically, when he said they were free, he meant they were free if you don’t get caught because he printed out a receipt for the item he’d taken in case a manager asked him"
"It was so nice that both you and your colleague were more concerned for their emergency that you forgot to ask them for payment, and it was great that the customers didn't take advantage of the situation but came back to pay later. I loved that the story ended in a great way instead of being a nightmare reprimand from your boss."
"Probably first job and Mommy and Daddy never punished her for ""borrowing"" from their wallets."
"One of my first career positions out of college, I was supervisor to the contract security guards at an industrial site. Think early 90’s. Cell phones and laptops were rarities, and expensive (esp for what little they could do). 

One day the sales manager comes back from vacation and reports his laptop missing. It was on a shelf in an unlocked cabinet in his office. The office was locked, so was that whole section after the day staff went home. Anyone walking out with it during the day would have been seen by a dozen people, at least. It had to have walked off overnight. The only ones that could get in after the section was locked? The dumb-ass security guards. Even the plant manager had to get security to let him in after hours. 

We knew it without doubt, but couldn’t prove it. We also didn’t know when it disappeared, so we didn’t know who was on duty at the time. There was nothing we could do. I had tried to talk them into security cameras after a couple of forced-entry events, but they wouldn’t spend the money.  We had nothing. 

One day an employee came in and told us the lead security guard had tried to sell her a laptop. She realized that the security tag on the underside marked it as ours. We set up a sting and let the lead security guard walk into it, carrying the laptop, only to be greeted by a room full of police. He couldn’t understand why we called the cops instead of just making him give it back. 

A crappy job it was, but that night was a hell of a lot of fun. "
"We had a guy come to the customer service desk saying he lost his phone. We helped him retrace his steps but it didn't turn up. He was freaking out. This was first thing in the morning. He was waiting outside for us to open when he did his quick shopping trip - meaning that not a lot of people had been in the store during and since he lost his phone. He berated all of us. He left. He came back yelling the find my phone said it was in the store and one of us had to have it. Finally got him to calm down and give me his contact info. I explained to him that sometimes when people find things they try to find the owners themselves and if they can't they bring the item back to us. About a half an hour later an employee brings me a phone she found... wait for it... in the Ladies Room. Our manager checked the tape and that's right, when he was here he went to the bathroom but he went to the wrong one. So of course when we retraced his steps we checked the Men's Room. Best part? I called him to let him know Good News! I found his phone!! and the phone in front of me rang. The number he left was the number for the lost phone. He eventually came back screaming about find my phone and I retrieved it from the office and let him know where it was found and let him know he had a message from me on the phone he lost letting him know it was found. He denied that he went to the Ladies Room. Denied it loudly. Good times.  edit: fixed fat finger typo"
" I really loved that job, we were lucky and had a great time and amazing customers ( only the boss was the issue, but what a big one he was ! )"
Well now how's your pops gonna get the farm?
"Right? Like, ""our bad, let us  just get that $2k for you since you seem honest and upstanding."""
"But you gotta admire the stupid audacity.


Or should that be audacious stupidity?"
I only make a fuss about anal probes once I realize the prober has both hands on my shoulders
LOL that's great! I love that she decided to do something funny to brighten your day.
"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals. ....emphasis on panicky. And dumb."
I know. He'll never have his free-range dachshund ranch now.
" You'll never get my brother's farm

"
"You should have told her that she can have a receipt, but it has to be emailed or texted. All legal!!!"
"Wait, what if she just believes that is just what you do when you need someone to wait while on the phone and isn't just something phone operators do when they need you to wait? What if she's gone her whole life believing that the person just starts playing music by the phone? O.o

Either way that's so precious. "
