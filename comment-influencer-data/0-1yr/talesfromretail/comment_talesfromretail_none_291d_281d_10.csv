"The kid probably has a good role model in his life, and it is not the mother."
"Honestly can't believe your manager did that. Let his employee be called a pervert and child molester and still buckle to the customer's stupid demands.

I'd have been fuming if mg manager had tried that. I expect crazy from the general public, I don't expect my manager to pacify that crazy at the expense of my dignity."
"Other things I believe this customer might say:

""I had to make my plate MYSELF""- at the buffet

""I had to fill my tank MYSELF""- at the gas station

""I had take money out of my bank account MYSELF""- at the ATM"
"Would have been hilarious if your manage had told you to go cashier and she ended up in your lane.   

Sorry I can’t ring these up for you, I’m not allowed to touch them.   "
"""Why on Earth would a business that exclusively sells ice cream sell me a cake that was made from ice cream!?! Let me talk to your manager!"" 

I'm so curious what is going on in these people's heads."
I worked retail in a city with a heavy military population. We would routinely have customers complaining that they could get certain items cheaper at whichever military exchange. I would tell them to take advantage of their deals since we weren’t allowed to price match them. So much rage from that simple statement.
"Also fun is the people who dumpster drive (or comb the parking lot) for discarded receipts, go grab something off the shelf, and then come up to the service desk to 'return' it. "
"&gt;she's going to go to a different pool from now on

Lucky you"
"I once randomly made eye contact with a customer who proceeded to flip the hell out. She pulled out her phone and started recording me saying she was going to put my ugly ass face on facebook for accusing her of stealing. She then stormed out.

The cart she left behind had a trash can with $800 of power tools in it."
"By god, Karen will get her $2.75 back if it kills her and everyone else in the store!"
"In a year from now you'll be like ""Bitch, do I LOOK stupid?  Then why you wanna treat me like I am?"""
"I hate when people say "" I've been waiting for X amount of time"" when the store /pharmacy whatever clearly is not open and has clearly posted signs stating the hours of operation. Just because you got here at 9 Karen doesn't mean we're behind when we open at the posted hours of 10. "
"Being the owner of said Ice Cream shop, it brings me dark pleasure when I'm asked for the manager. &gt;:D"
Do they at least do rain checks?
"I was worried for a minute they thought they were getting all of it for only $10. 

I love the ending though :)"
"I once had an AP “Officer” accuse me of trying to steal something in my shoe.

He just couldn’t and wouldn’t believe the bulge in my ankle was a plexiform tumor. I was detained and forced to remove my shoe when the cops showed up.

Watching the smug look on his face turn to utter horror was fun, watching him get fired was better.

I should’ve sued."
The type of loser that would continue stealing beer from a store is the same type of loser that wouldn’t pay his debts. He got what was coming to him.
"When I worked retail, a semi rolled up after the store and therefore loading dock was closed, but employees were still locking up. When the receiving manager politely but firmly refused him entrance, he drove down the street, parked the semi, walked back and beat the crap out of her.

EDIT: He was arrested. That’s all I know."
  I told her if I was working register when she come in I wouldn't be able to sell her that stuff since I couldn't touch it.  
“I had to eat my food MYSELF” - during lunch
I hate to admit I can see how he misinterpreted it. But the rant? No excuses. If I did that I’d have felt so dopey I’d have been laughing at myself.
But of course she's a cake decorator - she buys a box from Pillsbury and follows directions *to the letter*.  /s
I hope some of the receipts were outide of the return date just so you could say no to some of them
Honestly if I were up for thieving that sounds like a good idea. Why wouldn't it work? 
"""So why are you trying to get it here if you could get it cheaper there?"" would've been my response, but that's just me. I'm not sure how much trouble you'd get in for saying that, but it seems like more of a reasonable than condescending question to ask."
"My work has a self serve coffee line with one cashier where you can get basic coffee or tea.  It has a big ""Self Serve"" sign above it. You pick up a cup, place it under the coffee spigot to fill, then pay at the cashier. 

Across the hallway there is a full serve coffee line (of the same brand/company) with multiple cashiers and multiple coffee attendants that do more complicated orders and will get your coffee for you. The line is a little longer for waiting at the full serve. 

Every time I've gone through the self serve there is always someone who will demand the cashier help get their coffee. Usually someone else in the line will help the person figure out how to work a spigot and fill the cup. The person will then complain about the horrible service. 

Yep it's called self service. If you aren't happy with the service you can only get mad at yourself. "
"If I've learned anything from growing up with a mother who can be pretty toxic at times, it's how not to treat people who are just trying to do their jobs the best they can."
"I work retail, and right now a sickness is sweeping the store (it's a really bad cold, super contagious apparently). Yesterday I saw a coworker with his hands in plastic bags ringing out a customer, making sure not to touch anything, including the customer's card. I thought it was odd and asked him about it later, he said that the customer was in chemotherapy and so he wasn't taking any chances of getting the man sick. I thought it was really touching. He wasn't asked to do this either, he just did it. "
Reminds me of the time I was driving  home from a long trip and forgot I still had my sunglasses on after the sun set. I was wondering why it was so dark for 4:00 at night. It didnt actually get dark for another two hours.
"I'm laughing out loud at work. Thank you!

Also, goals. He sounds like someone I want to be when I grow up. "
At what point do unfair customer reviews count as libel?
Unfortunately I think she was a regular and knew about the return policy. The few dozen receipts I did help sort out were all within the return policy. Maybe the receipt my co-worker had to get a manager for was the one out of date lol. 
"I actually once had a customer ask me not to touch their stuff because I had a cold. tbh I was a little weirded out/offended but they apologized and said it was important because they were buying things for an old folks home and any germs could be a serious problem, so I just had them hold items up for me to scan and they bagged everything themselves. Looking back now that was kinda funny but this woman just sounds ridiculous to me lol

&amp;#x200B;"
"&gt;deadass

I’m dying of laughter twice as much after reading how you told your customer you’d be fantasizing of selling to a deaf person lol

Great job though! &lt;3 that was truly wholesome. "
Tell them you fucking gave them one already. Everything is tax free. Wtf do they think that is?
"I figured out a Spanish speaker wanted disposable litter boxes and ordered them for her.

I was so proud "
Sounds like she'd done it before and the manager knew what she looked like... or your LP folks saw her doing it and alerted your manager.
I bet her mother and father are ecstatic to have such a kind and caring woman be their daughter.
Why did she get a refund?
"He paid the ass tax, and he still thinks he got a good deal. Fantastic."
"Yeah this annoyed me more than the initial ignorant customer. The woman was an idiot. You would have to be not to realize that men were likely involved in every step from design, production, delivery, marketing of those tampons and diapers. 

She deserves to be called out for her idiocy but a simple ""I am sorry you feel that way but there is nothing wrong with a man stocking feminine hygiene products"" would have sufficed. 

Seriously how much flak was the manager expecting from this had he not caved? So she goes and leaves a review or makes a social media post complaining of a man stocking tampons.  I don't think many other shoppers would care. If anything I think she would get shamed for he idiotic position. "
"I've had countless customers start shouting at me because ""They drove for 45 minutes"" or ""Waited for half an hour in line"" just to find out we don't have something.

Some dude yesterday (Day after Black Friday, mind you) got mad at me because we didn't have 7 of a specific webcam in stock and he said he drove for 45 minutes to get here. Like man for fucks sakes"
"To be fair, he kept stealing because he knew we couldn’t do anything about it. But that begs the question - why not sell off some of the damn beer!?"
Or maybe it is and she was having a very bad day and got shut down by her own conscience.
"We get followed all the time.... never stolen a thing ever. And to top this off, at Wally world to make it better, we went black friday shopping and bought headphones went home and the box was empty. So we had to go back and they told us there was a chance we would have to come back the next morning so they can review tapes. But then we told them who rang us up...."" OH TYLER IS A FUCKING MORON. NOBODY LIKES HIM HE SUCKS ASS. God.... well here, we can refund you and you can go get a full package of your headphones. """
"Those who get caught, geniuses that they are, often come directly from the back of the store (instead of circling around so that they appear from my perspective to be coming from an entrance) and Loss Prevention can view tape to see if they even came in with anything. Attempts to do this are also why some stores (and I wish mine did as well) have the greeters log in and mark things coming in the store with something like an initialed or dated sticker. 

That said, I'm sure a lot of them get away with it by not being completely obvious about it. "
Why would she get a refund when she's clearly at fault?
