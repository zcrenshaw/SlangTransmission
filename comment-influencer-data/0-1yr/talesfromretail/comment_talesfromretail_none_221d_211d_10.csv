exactly! Like Stewie in family guy
At my nearest one they use them for demonstrations all the time and bratty kids frequently yeet bath bombs in without permission.
"Just don't tell your boss-self why the ad budget was so high last year, maybe he-you won't ask..."
Oooh this is interesting! They’re friggen strict here. Pharmacists have to sign off EVERYTHING which really puts a damper on your day 
I'm so glad it all worked out in the end.  She sounds like a wonderful person to know.
"If she wasn’t stupid, then she totally thought she was being maliciously compliant and clever. "
If you can't help her just pay it forward and help somebody else in a similar fashion. You're lucky you got such a sweet lady to really help you in a sticky situation.

I should have phrased that better XD. I loved my original Nokia!

Honestly some people. Just cut the mould off. It's cheese. That's the whole point. Also it'd be kinda funny if she boight blue cheese.. 
"I only just figured out how to reply on mobile, so please forgive me on my lateness to reply. 

Sadly,  she did this on a regular basis with the crocodile tears if not with me it was to other staff members. The only time where she didn’t do this is when her relative was working, she would always ask if they were that day. We should have really caught on tbh now looking back. 

Also, due to the county council (if you haven’t guessed I’m from the UK) we were the only supermarket within 30 miles radius and because she was blind we had to accommodate her. Wished my manager negotiated harder with having someone with her. :( "
**NEK MINNIT**
"&gt; it usually isn't about the interviewer's bias, but about the customers'

Yep. My first real job was as a cashier in a grocery store in a town that was mostly elderly people. We weren't allowed facial piercings, unnaturally coloured hair or visible tattoos. The same grocery store in the bigger city 45 minutes away (where I live now) totally allows that stuff."
"I'm trying not to feel old, but I've had many similar experiences. How am I supposed to respond without HR coming after me?

""Hey Trisha, your ass is hanging out of your pants. Can you wear something more appropriate?"" I'm fired."
"Or... And maybe it's just the way I was raised, don't fucking lie. Just point them to the bathroom. "
"If we work late nights, no one cares. If we're open, look professional."
The store I work at actually has that. 1 of the entries is locked 15 mins before closing and security stands at the other 2 entries. People are only allowed to leave the store
"My particular store has a promo where on a certain table we have food items for ""free"" as in get back that price in the form of gift credit. I'm waiting to see someone over there just chompin' down going ""all I read was FREE"""
It was 1000% worth it!
"It's 11:50 pm. I can't sell you alcohol.

*dodges thrown bottle of booze*"
"Again, how'd that work out? "
"How do you let customers come in with large bags? 

That's flag #1

Most places have a policy in place to prevent at least that much theft at one time."
"Trucks with dual still have two separate tanks though? Unless that's changed in the newer years??

I had a truck with two separate gas tanks. You just flip a switch inside the truck on the dash for the tank you want to use but one tank was in front of the back tire and the other tank was behind the back tire. "

Maybe a psychotropic for uncontrolled and misplaced anger.
Years later. 101 smiley. 103 star. 105 and I believe 132 are also really common. Worked there for 2 years

I’ve been through a similar experience. I honestly fucking hate women like this. Why can’t they just fuck off!?

"....this is the first time I truly understood that phrase. I never really thought about why ""airhead"" meant first, but that makes sense. "
All guitars are probably the same and sound the same to a lousy  musician.
I honestly fucking hate men like this. Why can’t they just fuck off!?
"Are you serious?!?

A parent being concerned about their child’s wellbeing is natural and the sign of a good parent

Last thing I’d do is tell such a person to fuck off"
"I was held a gunpoint when I felt this way. I refused to hand over my wallet.

Turns out, the gun wasn't loaded. Everyone in that car seemed to think it was hilarious as they drove away."
"""Hey, Trisha, your pants aren't meeting the dress code.  If you need the policy explained, talk to HR.""  + ""Now clock out, go home, and change"" or ""If you show up again like that I'm going to send you home to change"" as appropriate."
"Gotcha beat - at Home De-pot or Walmart, can't recall, a few years back, usual jeans, work boots, black t-shirt...

Apparently I gave off effing Retail Worker Vibes™ - had people, multiple people - coming up to me asking store related questions.

Weirdest shit ever.  Worked 20 miles away, so, I dunno.

Strange."
"&gt; Trucks with dual still have two separate tanks though? Unless that's changed in the newer years??

Apparently these were linked together without a switch. This was like 20-ish years ago, so I don't know how typical or legal it was.

&gt; the other tank was behind the back tire.

Yikes... I've seen enough cars plow under the rear bumper of a truck to think that would be a good idea."
"My long term medication is caffeine, staying hydrated, and not shying away from sodium. "
"While I'm not trying to defend this woman, nor would I ever attack someone about it, I too prefer the yellow Hydros over the new white ones. I'm sorry that happened to you!"
