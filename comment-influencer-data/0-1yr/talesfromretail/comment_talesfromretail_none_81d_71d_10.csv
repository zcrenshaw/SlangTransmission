"Whenever my mom took me grocery shopping with her she'd let me pick out a donut from the bakery. If I was good for the rest of her shopping she'd let me eat it in the car on the way home. At the register, after paying for it, she'd hand it to me and ask ""And what do we tell dad?"" And I'd saying ""Nothing!"" and she'd give me the donut and say ""That's right, unless he asks. We don't lie."""
It varies. There's a nice old mexican lady that comes in when I'm working the closing shift. She calls me mijo and talks about her cats and stuff. It's a lot better than standing there staring at the clock after I've already faced up everything within reach.
You probably made that kid's week.
I love when people tell me they‚Äôre never shopping here again. Good riddance.
"My husband's mom likes to sneak him money. Like $20 here and there. It's hilarious because she goes to some strange extremes to do it. She's asked my husband to cut a branch off a tree because she knew her husband (his dad) would fuss the whole time he was doing it and would follow him outside, then as soon as the door shut behind them she ran to the closet where her ""secret stash"" of cash is and told me to put it in my purse before my FIL came back inside. 



The thing is my FIL knows she does it lol. There has been a few times where they're at our house and my husband and MIL will be talking quietly and my FIL will deliberately turn his back to them and whisper to me ""she's going to sneak him money,  pretend you're talking to me so she thinks I don't notice"".


I love my in-laws"
What the actual...?? I would have refused the sale just for the sheer stupidity.
"‚ÄúHe probably is too smart for all your toys!‚Äù

Then why are you here? If he‚Äôs that smart, make him go out and get a fking job. 

I *hate* braggart parents."
WTF?  Why didn‚Äôt the mum just give the kid $100 and use the gift card to pay for her own purchases?   Logic fail there
Your company needs a new bank.
"Gotta love calling their bluff. Someone threatened to call the cops on my dad for something stupid, and he handed them his cellphone and said ""Go ahead"". They got flustered and left."
"My mom used to do this too, but it was my brother I couldn‚Äôt tellüòÇ"
"Happened to me with a receipt from 2011. Ot was underwear that was never worn and still in the package but our system was like NOPE. When I told her she could do a non reciepted return but it wouldn't be what she paid she pitched a fit.

Like lady, you're returning underwear from 9 years ago... If you needed $20 that badly why'd you hang onto them so long!?!"
"I worked in a cell phone store. The number of people who asked me for directions around town always confused the hell out of me. You just spent $1000 on a new iPhone, fucking use it! I got to the point where I would just take their phone and ask Siri for the directions right in front of them. Several still wanted me to explain how to get there. I just wanted to scream, ""YOU DON'T DESERVE TECHNOLOGY!"""
"Plot twist. Parents planned it ahead of time, cause they knew their kid deserved twice the smiles today"
"I had a bitch customer who said to my coworker, ""If i had her job I'd kill myself!"" Clearly she didnt see the scars on my arms or even thought about the words splurging out of her mouth, but her card got declined immediately afterwards."
"Can confirm.  

&amp;#x200B;

There was a cashier when I was young at a local grocery store.  She had the longest nails I've ever seen in a functioning human but she was awesome.  I still remember her showing me the bar codes and letting me scan things.  The store was quiet and it didn't cost her anything to be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

As a note, it's been 30+ years since that occurred.   I haven't been to that store since I was over 5 or 6.  I still remember."
"Theres a difference tho between the little old lady talking about the minecraft tshirt shes buying for her grandson  and how much he loves minecraft and the people that come in and tell you every detail of their life including what their last surgery was like and the fact that they're losing their teeth, etc.

Too many people overshare. Theres a time and a place for that stuff and in the checkout at the grocery store isnt one of them imo"
"One of my customers (about 70 years old) told me he passed out on the side of the road. I tried to be sympathetic and asked if the doctors could help.

He told me he has PTSD. Then I nodded sadly and wished him well.

Then he continued to tell me how he saw a baby get shot in the head so he faints when anxious now. I continued to nod and say I'm so sorry.

Then he continued to tell me how his girlfriend doesnt understand his disorder and how she doesnt treat him right. I continue quiety nodding and trying to change the subject.

Then he continues to tell me how effed up he is and how he needs a better girl. Then he starts hitting on me and telling me how my boyfriend should treat me (I'm single but didnt say anything) for about 10 more minutes. THEN he told me I was a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow and left.

Whew, what rollercoaster that was."
I have worked at a convenience store off and on for 9 years.  The amount of very personal things people have told me is astounding.  I also don't care about any of it and having to stand there and listen kills me.  Especially if I have a line of other people who just want to buy their stuff and get out.
I‚Äôd love it more if they actually meant it.
"i can almost always break 100s at my job, but then everyone gets huffy that they got back a pile of 5s and 1s because that‚Äôs the only real change we keep. do i look like a bank? be happy i was able to take it at all."
"Yea. If a bank ever tried to charge me for swapping cash for coins, they would never see me again. Even a bank I don‚Äôt have an account with. 

Actually, especially a bank I have an account with."
A little touch of karma for a sketchy insensitive AH.
"Next time tell people like that it is the law, and to take it up with the state."
"Meh. Things like that can happen. You hide gifts for people in the closet in the guest room or on a shelf in the garage, and other stuff gets pushed in front of it -- the difference is, if something like this happened to most people, they'd donate the item or put it in a yard sale, not try to return it!"
"&gt;because everyone that happened to work at that time were in fact Hispanic and did speak to him in Spanish.



So why the hell do you need to learn it if there‚Äôs plenty of people in the store to help the Spanish-speaking customers?"
This seems like such a nice job! Im sure you get your fair share of weird and rude clients but I would love to be face painting instead of getting yelled at by and old lady trying to get irrational coupons!
"My divorced parents both gave me Friday lunch money. For years. My dad was ""I don't know weather to be mad or impressed"" when he found out.

I never lied about it. Just kept my damn mouth shut."
I know the pain of go backs but I'd rather customers hand me everything they don't want instead of having me to find it later. We'd avoid situations like this and so many other annoyances.
She wasn't addicted to heroin 9 years ago
"Worked with this nurse that asked.me to translate Spanish for her. Told her I dont speak spanish. She said ""But your last name is Perez!"" Her last name was Martinez."
"And when they still argue - and they will - point out that the liquor board runs stings on a regular basis, and those who participate act *exactly* this way.

""Are you working for the liquor board? Is this a sting?"""
That‚Äôs what my mom did when I was younger. I got a few amazon gift cards for birthdays and Christmas but when I was younger I never really online shopped a whole lot so my mom would give me cash and I would give her my gift cards.
This is why I always encourage people to get addicted to heroin as soon as possible. If she had gotten addicted to heroin earlier she wouldn‚Äôt be having this problem.
"My dad still gives me cash for ""gas money"" when I drive home for a visit (I live about 4 hours away.)


I'm 52. My dad is 90. I'm so lucky to have him.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I love when they try to bring legality into play.

They're in a private store. At least here in the US, we can refuse service for any reason whatsoever (within reason, of course; I'm not gonna tell someone I'm not selling to them because they're a minority, but I AM going to deny service to anyone who curses me out or threatens me)."
"I also work in southern california and deal with this all of the time. Like you can't complain about me not learning Spanish if you're not learning English, it's a 2 way street"
I would refuse the sale since it was attempted by a minor. If multiple people talk about it bring me alcohol I need to see everyone‚Äôs id. I ain‚Äôt trying to lose my job.
"To be honest, she probably did the exact some with the brother. Mom's are shady."
"I don't even like carrying such big Bills, I always try to break them down, because I know there is almost no place (that I usually go to) that would be able to have enough change. I would only consider using them if I had to get something more expensive.
Usually I hand out a bill that is around 1/4 more than what I have to pay.

I'm sorry that you had to deal with such unconsiderate behaviour. 
Like sure I'm gonna pay with a 100$ Bill for a 5$ purchase LMAO"
"I totally understand that language barriers are tough, and I‚Äôm learning Spanish to help that issue at the store I work at. But my goodness you can‚Äôt complain about someone not knowing Spanish in a country where most people don‚Äôt know Spanish. Especially if you ain‚Äôt learning english"
"It's funny how much further you get with politeness than screaming. 

Maybe that ought to be a t-shirt...."
"never happened to me. I can not even imagine that. I either deal with OK or rude ones. just 5 minutes ago (yes I am working right now) asked me where the bathroom was and its not on this floor, when i told him that, he started swearing and shouting and left. I mean???? sorry that I didn't design the building this way???"
"How sad is this lady's life when ice cream, one of the greatest inventions of the modern world, can't make her happy for a few moments?"
"I had a similar situation happen to me last week.  Two girls come in looking maybe 16 or so, I ask for ID and they said they don't have it but they do have a picture of their IDs.  I let them know that isn't valid ID.  They get pissed and leave, for the next half hour or so I have customers trying to buy the very thing I turned the girls down for (very specific cigar, I sell maybe 2 of them a week) and no one has a problem with it when I call them out, just complete their purchases and move on.  

About an hour after this started the girls are back, throw their IDs on the counter and start cursing up a storm.  I see they were both 20, remark on it, and they go on about ""we ain't no kids, don't treat us like ones"".  Well I had enough and told them if they're going to treat me so poorly I'm not going to sell to them regardless.

The outrage in their voices was worth it.  ""You have to, we have ID and money.  Legally you can't refuse us.""  Of course this isn't true and I tell them so.  ""We want to talk to your boss and they'll fire your ass.""  to which I laugh and say ""My boss isn't going to be mad I followed the law.""  At this point I'm more annoyed than angry and just let them know they can apologize and I'll sell to them or they can leave.

The one girl just walks away shaking her head and the other says ""sorry"" so I thank her and rang up the damn dollar cigar they spent an hour of wasted timed pursuing.  Honestly I'm just confused they didn't just go to one of like the 3 other stores within walking distance."
"This cannot be real.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe you but at the same time. What the actual fuck."
"Sometimes the universe listens...

And she definitely deserved to be heard.



I hope that you're in a healthier place."
"Lol reminds me of when i once had a manager ask me to remind her to make a call at a certain time

I grab my phone and say ‚Äúhey siri, remind me to remind maureen to call lucille at 2:15‚Äù

My manager (who had a newer iPhone than me) just went ‚Äúhow did you do that?!?!?‚Äù

You literally just saw me do it, you really gonna ask me how???"
It wasn't a bad gig! (I don't work there any more.) I still got yelled at plenty and a few kicks in the shins...oh and I wrecked my back leaning forward out of my chair to paint small children sitting on their chair (the chairs were the same height). But it was pretty cool.
