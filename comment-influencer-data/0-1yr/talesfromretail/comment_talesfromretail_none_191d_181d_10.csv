"Should have added that we are next to wally world that has exceptionally clean restrooms, so...yeah."
"One of my jobs is a bakery thats only closed on mondays and we get this CONSTANTLY. Its not a pastry bakery but instead makes tomato pie and stuffed breads, etc. Theres meat and dairy in them so they cant really sit out overnight and it’s a VERY small place so keeping them overnight for customers is prioritized for people who specifically requested it frozen. If, at the end of the day, i call someone to ask if theyre still coming to get their order and they ask me to keep it for the following day, i usually say no. If im feeling nice i let them know we’ll keep theyre order but it will get frozen or refrigerated overnight (depending on where we have storage space). 100% of the time they insist they still expected the order to be made fresh. Like they figured we’d just make their order fresh a second day in a row, and they didnt care about the wasted product from the previous day. People are ridiculous. "
"I don't think she uses it to keep warm, it's more like a white noise machine for her. She's admitted to basically having the same kind of addiction that u/esoper1976 references below. Are you a member of the Swamp Family too? :-)"
"Did his last name rhyme with ""Door""?  Sounds eerily familiar to an old DM we had in my district of used video game &amp; electronics retail."
"One of my best friends used to work as a rep for a PoS servicing company (basically, the business would hire their company as a service to install, update, and maintain the PoS system), and it was a common occurrence to be out for drinks or something with him and he'd help out/explain an issue or something to the worker, if not actually walk them through it.

"
"IDK but I am pretty sure that is slang meaning the guard actually took her out back, pureed her in a James Bond villain sized blender then sold the liquefied remains to the highway department to be sprayed on grass and flowers planted along the highways."
"Previous employees have asked about doing that too. And the owner, he visits frequently, won't do it I guess? I'm not sure why he won't,but I know we've asked a couple times."
"Sometimes people just need someone that'll listen to them, and since getting therapy has such a stigma (at least here in the US) that often falls upon customer service people."
Guess you guys don't have uber or lyft.

Reminds me of the plane that was having trouble flying. A passenger offered to help. Who was he? The designer of that aircraft. 
I still can’t believe that there are people out there that don’t set up their own instruments. It’s really the only way to be positive that you’re getting optimal performance at all times.
"As a fellow string player, viola, I mostly just keep it in my case and keep it inside as much as possible. I honestly don’t know how to properly take care of it, but I know not to drop it, tune it etc. I’m a middle school student in the music program who’s been a part of it for 1 and a half years, and I’d like to say I keep my $200 instrument in better condition than this man."
"&gt; Alright, so I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but please do not keep your guitars in a de-humidified room ...

Next you should have challenged the characterization: This was not a ""repair"". This is ""maintenance"" due to normal operations. Just like aligning the wheels on your car. You drive straight, smooth and true, you may never need to do an alignment. But if you scream around corners, bump into curbs, etc., you will likely need to both align the wheels and rotate them much more often.

For instance, keeping your guitar in a dehumidified room during storage and then making that transition into a non-dehumidified space to use the guitar can cause expansion and contraction much more often than necessary. Try keeping the humidity ""Constant"" and never let it dry out (which will damage the wood) if you want to avoid this maintenance. Now that you've moved here, after retiring, the humidity rules are different. Where did you come from? Colorado? Someplace with almost no humidity?"
"Not the OP, but I repair violins. String instruments can vary a lot in price. I recommend going to a luthier or music store with a solid string background. Don't buy something on the internet. 200 might get you an okay used student violin, but you're most likely going to be looking at least a bit more. Cheapo instruments are difficult to maintain and sound like crap, so make sure you get a solid student instrument.

Something I encourage a lot is to find a shop with a good rent to own option. Luthiers that do student instruments usually offer this. You will be able to afford something a little nicer that way, but don't have to commit to it all at once if you end up not sticking with it. I also recommend getting at least a couple lessons to get started."
"&gt; You need to keep them away from moisture - I keep mine in a de-humidified room!

I work for a piano shop. Reading this just made me die a little on the inside."
"Similarly, if you bought tires for Minnesota that were manufactured in and shipped from southern California, *probably* some PV=nRT variables are going to have changed along the way. :)"
I work in a music shop. We keep our acoustic guitars in a humidified room. When our humidifier broke for a week or two a bunch of them developed cracks and became unsellable.
"I think everyone that uses a POS eventually encounters it in the wild and helps someone out.

Plus, they're usually industry specific. It's shocking how many car-audio shops use TSS, how many golf courses use CPS, how many contractors use Intuit/Quickbooks, etc."

Wait till my Father hears about this! 
"Right out of the oven they will be hot, not cool."
"I'm the assistant manager of a small luggage store in an outlet mall. We sell suitcases, duffel bags, backpacks, all sorts of miscellaneous travel accessories &amp; all that junk, the store is filled with luggage. We have sets displayed in the window and a large sign that says our name, which includes the word 'Luggage'. First customer today walks in, I greet her &amp; she looks around confused and asks me &gt;""Is this the Ugg store?"" .... Yep, we hide the shoes in the luggage, lady. It's like 3 stores down with its own big sign. How do you mess that up? "
"No, but I'm not surprised to hear that sort of thing was a common occurrence at that place. "
"Honestly, that woman and her spawn (think Dr. Phil) are a pox on humanity."
"thanks for that. the sentiment seems to be ""let this lady vent! don't try to help at all or point out the emperor's nakedness, just let her vent."" but TBH if a business owner just gets mad in response to a mad customer, it's akin to being that guy who can't resist a ""dare"" and ends up in trouble all the time. there was a source for the client's anger. trying to resolve that for the future is NOT a bad idea."
It’s part of a major sale for the weekend but a lot of people just don’t want to “spend” that much money. Supposedly. 
"Thanks! I'm still new with this type of front desk work.  
And yeah, my dad can be pretty cool everynow and then :)"
Likely it's his first or second time there. I find the more someone claims they're a good customer the less they've spent.
"I really should have done that, but I was so taken aback I had no clue how to respond, and also I have the habit of taking things too personally so thought I was just overreacting. I now know for the future!  


And yeah, he can be kinda awesome sometimes lol"
"Exactly.

Extremes in temperature or humidity, or especially extreme, sudden changes are bad for guitars. It's not necessarily the presence of a dehumidifier itself, but if it's a normal room in your home with a dehumidifier running full-crank 24/7, the room is likely to be rather dry, which isn't good for the wood in the long term.

If your dehumidifier is always running, then it's possible it's never catching up to 50%, and that the humidity is higher than is good for your guitars. It's unlikely it would be that humid without you knowing it, though.

So long as you avoid unreasonable extremes and do regular maintenance, you're fine. Even if you're in a climate where unreasonable extremes are unavoidable, keeping it in a room that's comfortable for you and transporting it in an appropriate case will go a long way toward minimizing the extra wear and tear."
"I scrolled down to find this comment, I was going to say the same thing. 

One purchase, 15 years ago. "
Fucking onions!
You’re most likely unfortunately right 
"We were open about a week or two before this happened, so I’m assuming that someone forgot to change the hours back to normal on the site after that week"
"Happy birthday!

And woah, that's dark."
I just got stuck on the kids in the backseat part. I immediately think that they'd probably get treated badly by her in weird ways all the time.

IT SAID MY CAR CAME WITH LIFETIME OIL!
"It's almost like return policies are a new thing and no one has ever heard of them, right? /s"
"Just in a few major cities. I think Zurich, basel, Lausanne, and Geneva.
This because uber drivers here need to adhere to the same standards as taxi drivers. Yearly (I think) health check for drivers, car must always be top notch (every month inspecting or something along the lines, I didn't follow up) and so forth.
Taxi companies sued uber successfully once they wanted to expand here. And these standards rise the cost for the drivers significantly.
I think uber operates in these cities at a loss, because I doubt any driver would eat those costs for uber. "
"Sounds like my district manager before I left a certain gaming retailer.

&amp;#x200B;

Any time anyone complained about anything we would get scolded and forced to give people free things and then get scolded again for having so much loss in profit. I've been gone from that place for 8 months and nothing's changed at all and I still get to hear about the nightmare customers mistreating my friends and getting rewarded for it."
