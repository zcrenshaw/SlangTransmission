"Every now and then when I'm at the grocery store I see people walking through the aisles munching on family-sized bags of chips or in extreme cases even eating cookies straight out of the containers they come in. Yeah they pay for it at the register and it's technically not against the rules but like... *dude!* You're in the middle of a public store, not on your couch at home! You can wait 20 minutes to get outside before stuffing your face full of calories."
Must be rough on goldfish.
Honestly thank you SO much for standing up for the cashier. It‚Äôs frustrating when we can‚Äôt really say anything but so relieving when another customer does!! 
Always sad when these people get their way for being awful. 
"Omg yes! I answer the phone 

""ya'll fix motorcycles""  

""yes we are a repair shop""

""How much for a stator for my Suzuki?""

""um, we can order you one, but what model bike do you have?""

""Its a Suzuki! how much for a stator?!""

""There are hundreds and hundreds of models sir, I need to...""

""I think its an R6""

""sir that is a Yamaha""

""no I said Suzuki""

...dear god please kill me"
"Well, you gotta get your card scanned with the Magic Money Machine‚Ñ¢Ô∏è at the store, I'm sure it automatically connects to the bank, since it PAYS the store, so therefore the store has access to my banking info!! /s"
He should said his wife was very very fat and there was a spring poking her. Deep down. In the middle. But only if you're Real Real fat. Imperceptible to tiny salesmen.
"Just before the big heart holiday, I was stocking some shelves in our seasonal dept, and a lady was standing right in front of what I needed to stock. I waited a couple minutes while she talked to somebody across the aisle to her left (shelves were to her right), then said, ""excused me, could I get in there for a bit?""

She turns and focuses on me, and draws a deep breath while I cringe knowing I just woke the dragon. She snaps out, ""aren't I allowed to look?!"" and immediately turns back and tells the other person she was talking to that I am a raging bitch, and should shut up and wait because customers are more important. 

I bite my tongue and walk back to my cart, and proceed to hang out there opening boxes until she moves. She watches where I'm going and attempts to get in my way deliberately. I ignore her and walk away. 

It was just... I dunno, she was hell-bent on being nasty. What a miserable way to live."
Don't you know everything is in the back? /s
"Should have yelled after him ""Thanks for your service"""
The fun slang term for spouses like that is dependapotamus
"Aren't hams, by definition, smoked...? o\_O 

I mean, of course, with the exception of steamed hams. [Mmm, mm, steamed hams!](https://www.thewrap.com/simpsons-steamed-hams-explained/)

I was with a group of friends and I asked if I the store offered a military discount. They didn't and I said it was fine and that was the end of it. Or at least I hoped it was. My bestfriend's girlfriend's friend called them out for being unpatriotic in a joking and sarcastic way but everyone there just felt awkward after her comment.
"Crap! I just came home from the garage, I had my brakes swapped. The mechanic said that they, in fact, relied on customers paying for their work. And then he gladly accepted my payment. "
I have had so many similar experiences before (I work at a main chain grocery store in the bakery on the west coast) where customers insist that they‚Äôve gotten something here before that I have never EVER sold in my two years of being there. I had one lady try and convince me we had whole wheat bagels and I told 3 different times that we never sold them and even confirmed with a coworker who had worked here for almost 20 years. She was obviously mixing it up with the multigrain bagels but wouldn‚Äôt stand down when I told her we have never sold whole wheat bagels. It makes me chuckle but at the same time makes my blood boil when customers think they know all our products better than we do 
"&gt; I told him chickens don't go cheep

Especially the ones that have been beheaded and roasted..."
Stories that make me wonder if some people are even human beings.  :(

I like to go into our walk-in and have a drink. 
Yes B≈î√ò»öH∆è≈ò
Are you smoked? 
"Unless you are getting fresh side meat, the only difference between cured and un-cured bacon is where the nitrites where sourced from."
"Yeah, they use celery juice extract which contains sodium nitrate instead of an isolated nitrate additive. The important thing is that they don't use 'pink salt' or nitrites."
"That is exactly what we did,  and they'd ask us why sales were down. Good natured regulars who we knew would not sign up would cut a deal with us where they pretend to listen while we asked 3 times in a row and then reported results to the gm lol."
"I feel you, trying to explain to people the payment terminal screen is not pressure sensitive SO PLEASE STOP STABBING IT. Or when I‚Äôm overseeing the self checkouts and everyone gets real confused about why the computer is yelling at them. Well gee, if you tell it you didn‚Äôt bag it and then you put it on the bagging scale when it‚Äôs no longer expecting that weight, why yes it will in fact tell you that there‚Äôs an UNEXPECTED ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA. Sure, sometimes the scales are wonky or an item is incorrectly coded, but that‚Äôs maybe 10% of the scale problems. At least 90% is ID 10T errors. Oh well I tried to put it there before I scanned it and then I pressed the button that I was using my own bags even though I‚Äôm not, why do you have to verify it. 
Couple days ago had someone ragequit the self check and go to a cashier after not being able to figure out how to ring up their own avocado, after I carefully explained it to them (after watching them try to scan the tiny barcode on the PLU sticker for about a minute). Showed them where the numbers were, where the ‚Äúkey in code‚Äù button was, etc. ‚Äî walked back over a minute later when they were trying to re-enter the PLU on the ‚ÄúQuantity Needed‚Äù screen. They couldn‚Äôt figure out the bagging or hitting the item not bagged button part and left for the nearest register. Plenty of our customers this kind of confusion is understandable, but both of these people spoke clear unaccented English and were at least almost adults, so how they got this far without basic reading comprehension I‚Äôll never know. But that goes for a lot of people I encounter. "
"Worked in retail delis and every honey ham that I've ever seen is also smoked, just not as heavily as black forest."
"This was obviously all your fault.  You didn't have her size in the junior department, and the right department didn't have anything she liked despite her fitting into them.

See?  It's your fault."
I mean is that not how it's supposed to be? ü§î
"I buy uncured bacon. It's a bit of a misnomer though, it's literally just sliced pork belly."
"You know, outside of retail I had noooo problem being an antagonist and saying that sort of thing. Back then I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I was too polite."
"We treat everyone in uniform as a hero. And it becomes accepted and expected. Some even begin to think they're a better class of citizen because they volunteered for the job. 
The uniform doesnt make the man.
"
Just keep being proud of yourself. One day in the future I hope you re-read your comments and realize exactly how you sound.
"I had a coupon for one box of cereal up to a $5 value with a line for the cashier to write in the actual value.  I brought up a $3 box of cereal along with some other items.

After arguing with the cashier and then the manager I gave up and let them give me $5 off my entire purchase instead of $3 off my cereal.

It really makes me wonder though...if I had not been buying anything but the cereal would they have worked out how the coupon actually works or would they have handed me $2 from the register along with my free cereal?"

"Eighteen hours later and it still gives me a chuckle. 

I need to get a life."
"Son, you're in the wrong subreddit."
I demand to see a manager.
"I agree, for the last few decades they signed up to ruin America's reputation abroad for corporate interests that don't put value on human life, yours or theirs. What part of that is patriotic? "
"Right?  Good job, you are doing your part to protect America's freedom to operate in capitalism and screw you and every one you work with for resources, keep it up!

Damn, that is hard to spin as a pep talk..."
