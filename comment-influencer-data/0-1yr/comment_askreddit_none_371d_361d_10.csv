"I’m sure it’s possible but I don’t think they do. I have always gotten positive reactions and they tend to hang around and chat with me for a longer time than they tend to chat with the men. 

Maybe they don’t hate me so much because I usually ask before touching the first time and I try to seek out the strippers who set off my gaydar. Obviously the fact that they were making money off of me helped too. I wouldn’t just walk up to a random girl and grope her without any introductions or anything. 

Basically, if you are a woman and you want to get away with breaking the rules at strip clubs:

1. Pick one who is actually bisexual (they will all say they are, even if they aren’t. Use gaydar)
2. Make it clear that you are worth her time by tipping her for table dances or inviting her to sit at your table and buying her a drink 
3. One you have chatted a little, complement her bodacious booty and ask if you can touch it 
4. If she’s comfortable being touched by you she will usually tell you something along the lines of, “those rules are really just for the men.” 
5. Now it’s pretty safe to go for it during lap dances. Grope away. 
6. Stop going to the strip club and find a real girlfriend because you’re going to go fucking broke"
"&gt;Mr. P told us what was going on. Against the express wishes of the principal.

I don't get why so many teachers seemed opposed to telling students what was going on. Even a little kid can understand, ""There was a big plane accident in NY/the Pentagon this morning. Lots of people were hurt, but your teachers and families are going to make sure you stay safe.""

Even being so close to one of the plane crashes, you can dumb it down for kids so long as you tell them *they're* going to be safe. I don't get why adults chose to hide it from kids that day."

It's one of my most marked experiences of the day. Everyone's shields were down. Everyone was raw. People were just looking each other in the eyes like long lost lovers or like children. And silently walking by. 

Thank you for sharing this. I hadn't known anyone else with this experience."

I am currently 42 now and healthier than most of my friends with no issues. I have only recently had to start taking meds to control rhythm, but my mom was told I wouldn't make it to 20. 

I have great doctors and never miss an appointment. I get tired faster than most people because my chambers are reversed, but I keep up pretty well and I don't over-do it. If I am out of breath, I don't push on, I chill out and yoga is one of my best friends. Transposition can't get me down. "

"It was a complete shock to me. We grew up in church together and he was always a nice guy. In high school he was in a really bad car accident and was in a coma for a while. The only difference I noticed from the brain damage he sustained was that he spoke and read much more slowly and seemed to have lost a few IQ points. He was never a super bright kid to begin with so it was a minor change. After he was convicted of first degree murder I read the police report. Apparently his neighbors *did* see it coming because his behavior at home had completely changed after the accident. Neighbors reported that he killed puppies and tortured small animals for fun leading up to the murder, and were saddened and disgusted, but not particularly surprised that he killed a person.

The scary part for me is that I knew him after he had changed. If I had only known him leading up to the accident and then he dropped off the face of the planet, it would be much less of a shock to hear that his personality had done a 180 and he was a psycho. But it turns out the nice guy I saw in public every week was actually just hiding the fact that he was deranged, and I completely bought it."

Apparently I was the only one in the district to write something in the spot.

"It honestly depends on the form of feminism. The most open form of feminism I'm familiar with doesn't push for *rote equality* in all things, it pushes for equality of expectation and opportunity.

So, for instance, there is nothing anti-feminist about a woman *wanting* to stay home, raise a family, cook dinner, etc. *So long as that's what she wants and what she chooses.*

It is similarly not anti-feminist for a woman to appreciate ""traditional chivalry"" and so on, but it's not fair or reasonable to expect the man in that scenario to appreciate it as well. I mean, he *might*, but you can't expect it.

I know guys that are kinda useless, and just mooch, and coast, and so on. I wouldn't expect women to be any different, it just isn't a comment on their gender. They're just a person I don't really like being around.

Consent isn't really just about sex. You and a partner, SO, etc. can have any kind of relationship dynamic that you want, so long as:

1. You both want it, and communicate that fact.
2. You don't engage in unsafe behavior as part of your dynamic. (For instance, two people might both like it if the guy is usually displaying a lot of machismo personality, but don't get into a bar fight because of it).
3. You don't engage in insane behavior as part of your dynamic. (For instance, two people might both prefer it if it's the ""man's job"" to provide and the ""woman's job"" to clean, but don't actively sabotage her career in doing so, she might need to provide for herself if you break up.)

Feminism, at its core from what I've seen, is really about the fact that a lot of shit happens to women in their lives *outside* of sex without their consent that men usually are given consent options for. But *what you choose* should not have any bearing on *whether you have the choice*.

I don't view the sex aspect of feminism to really be ""feminism"", that's more just... basic human rights."

"Depends on the ultimatum. I was in an adult multi-year relationship.

To my amazement she qualified for **free** (no copay, no billed time) behavioral health visits! 

About twice week she would have some kind of interaction with her mother or even just remember some terrible shit that had happened and I would become the outlet for her anger. Often, she would apologize after the fact, but it didn't change how terrible it was in the moment. 

After a particularly bad incident, I told her ""I know you can visit a therapist for free. If you don't start going to a professional to work through this, I'm leaving you."" 

She didn't, so I left her. 

There's a happy ending. She eventually did see a therapist and her life is a lot better now. We still keep in touch, and she seems happier with her current boyfriend.

"In my last couple of years at school, my group of friends were sort of the clichéd ""misfits"", so I suppose it's not surprising that someone a bit strange gravitated to us.     
    
This guy (henceforth known as Jim) came from a very religious family (I grew up in a religious area) and had clearly had a very sheltered and somewhat isolated upbringing.  I was going through my edgy atheist phase (still an atheist, no longer edgy) and he would constantly try to win my soul for Jesus.  When I asked him why he wouldn't stop, he said it was because he liked me and didn't want me to go to Hell.  At the time I joked that it was the nicest thing anyone had every said to me and just put up with it.  This is not the creepy part.    
    
A couple of my male friends had a running joke about being in a sexual relationship with each other (they weren't and are not gay).  Jim must have found our joking about taboo subjects liberating and would join in.  He started texting one of the girls in our group about his dreams.  This started off as ""haha, my dreams are so surreal and random"" but over time the dreams (while still surreal and random) started to include explicit sex (always with a man).  This was not where we cut contact or even had the good sense to involve an adult.  There were some talking-tos about boundaries and what not but we felt sorry for this isolated boy and stayed friends with him.  One day he licked another boy on the hand during a study session in the school library.  I've never seen anyone sprint so fast for the toilets.  We had another discussion about what crossed the line and still didn't cut contact.     
    
One weekend we all went to stay at a house at the beach owned by the parents of one of the group.  No adults present.  At some point during the trip, Jim confided in one of the others that he wasn't taking his medication.  Now, Jim was pretty sickly and was off school a lot.  I'm still not completely sure whether his medication was for a mental or physical illness.  Anyway, everyone was messing around doing their usual innuendo laden banter, when Jim whispered to one of the other guys to meet him upstairs.  This guy then (not knowing what was going to happen, but probably should have known better) persuaded one of the girls (who was very childlike and innocent) to go in his place.  She opened a bedroom door to find Jim lying in bed, apparently naked.  He was under the covers, thankfully.  From then on, understandably, this girl was too scared to be in a room with Jim without the rest of us.   
     
The final event was on the way home on the bus, when Jim confided in the guy sitting next to him that he had stolen a pair of his underwear, and was wearing them.  That was the point where we noped out.   
     
I've since tried to figure out what made him act that way.  I'm not sure if it was mental illness, like loss of inhibition due to bipolar disorder.  Maybe he was just so poorly socialised that he had no idea where the line between a joke and sexual harassment lay.  Maybe he was gay and was trying to provoke us into raising the issue, as there was no way his family would accept it.  I don't know. 
     
Oh, and by the way, Jim is a minister now."

"From an evolutionary standpoint, it would make sense. Back when humans had little scraps to throw out, the only wolf to eat was the one who could catch the scraps before all the other ones. 

So the ones that were bad at catching didn't eat and most likely starved and the ones who were scarily good at it got to eat, survive, and pass its genes down to another wolf. "

"I understand how that can be confusing. Truthfully, women orgasm a lot of different ways, and some are actually not as “sexy” as guys realize, particularly when guys are referring to porn as inspiration. Dry humping (see r/girlshumpingthings) is a very common example. 

But I absolutely agree with you, if a girl says that she is fine and doesn’t need anything else you should believe her. And as many have mentioned, we still love sex without orgasm! But if it keep happening and you want new options, you can try if you’re comfortable with her to ask how she masturbates, etc. It may help open some doors. "

"When I was 12 (1999) while shopping at KMart, my stepdad entered us into a raffle. One day several weeks later I came home from summer camp and saw a message on the home phone answering machine. The message informed that I had won the Banna Boat raffle.  As a 12 year old I was estatic. Me...won something, even better it was a boat. My friends were gunna be so jealous. But what was a Banana Boat? Oh well who cares. So I called my mom at work and told her the news. She of course was confused but said she would stop by KMart to pickup the prize. When my mom got home she took me outside to show me my glorious prize. I of course was confused when I didnt see a boat in the driveway. She then opened the trunk and there was my Banana Boat. Sitting in the trunk was a gift basket filled with $100 worth of Banana Boat branded  suntan lotions and skin care products. Needless to say I was highly disappointed.

"Nothing against my parent or friends, everything against my hometown and my own depression.

My hometown is dying very rapidly. There's nothing there. I have to drive nearly 40 min from the house to go to Walmart or to a non fast food restaurant.

My family is very overbearing, especially with me (brother died when we were kids, so everyone subconsciously pushed their ""the good die young"" complex onto me) They've learned to chill these past couple of years that I went off to college, but it was suffocating. I couldn't hang out at a friend's house for a couple hours without someone freaking out about texting them where I was every hour (surprise: we're still at her house, we haven't moved from her sofa in the past hour). And then they'd get worried that I wasn't going out and socializing enough--even if I wanted to, which I didn't really, I couldn't go to any parties or anything without having to text ""hey update: I took a step to the left due to instructions from a pop song, please do not freak out"". 

But the main reason I came to the realization that I had to leave, was because of myself. I am always horribly depressed daily when I visit home, and while depression doesn't leave me alone when I leave, it isn't a daily thing when I'm not home. I mentioned before I had a dead brother, his loss was very hard on me, and I think being in a house that is just bleeding with memories of someone who should've come home but didn't is negatively impacting me. That, coupled with the fact that there's no place to escape to in town, and the fact that I can't take a day trip more than an hour away without someone inevitably freaking out about my wellbeing, my depression doesn't handle that all very well.

This all became very clear to me about midway through college. I was talking with my roommate who mentioned she didn't want to go back to school and do work; whereas I was totally fine doing the work if it meant I was back on campus. Then I realized that I am much more active and less anxious on campus than I ever could be in my own home. There was all sorts to do!!!!!!within walking distance even!!!! I only had to answer to my roommate about my whereabouts, specifically for safety reasons or if she wanted to join me when she was free--and I knew she wasn't projecting my brother's death onto me! She didn't even know him!!! Speaking of which, I was in a new city, nobody knew me! Nobody asked about how my family was doing or looking at me with immense pity! Sure I still had depressive episodes with unpredictable triggers, I can't help that, but those moments were less common than the good moments!

So I decided to stay in my college town after graduation. I'm currently home packing for my new apartment, and I'm still ok with doing the work and paying the bills if it means I get the chance to be happy."

"A lot of them are really scared too. I work near a college and I'm a bigger male with unruly hair most of the time. You can see how TERRIFIED some of the girls get when they're alone around you, even if you nod and smile and say hello. Because they've been taught men are nothing but horrible rape monsters who can't help themselves or be trusted. 

I remember listening to NPR at work one morning and listening to a woman say ""We have to teach our men NOT to rape"" to a group of people who were agreeing with her. It's sickening the divide that's growing between all the groups in this country, even men and women. "
"Who the hell wants to go through life ""surviving."" People want to live and be happy. Things that make her happy differ from things that make you happy.

"I'm gonna go with ""all of the above but mostly number 3"".

Real talk though, it's not a dealbreaker for me by any means, especially since I'm 5'5"", but it would be nice to be just a couple inches taller than a girl. I dunno, I just feel like it's kind of cute that way. But again, not a dealbreaker.

Somewhat related story that I feel like sharing because it's legitimately one of my favorite memories, I was in an audio group chat with my friends and one of them was talking to his girlfriend about height of people and dating and stuff. Relevant note is that the girlfriend used to have a crush on me when we were in school together but I turned her down and after a while started dating my friend. I don't remember exactly how the conversation got to this particular point, but I just remember her saying (negatively), ""Yeah, like if you're 5'5"" and a guy!"" Everyone can hear her but she can't hear anyone else because of headphones, but despite this I loudly call out, ""*Bitch!*""

My friend immediately asks, ""Wait a minute, are you 5'5""?""

""Uhh, yeah.""

""*Well then...*""

And we all burst into laughter. I legit was crying from laughing so hard and when I randomly think about it in public, it makes me smile like some kind of weirdo. Anyways, no real moral to it. Just wanted to tell that story."

They get a little further down the road and his friend, who had been walking on the outside, and a half a pace behind says ""You know he had a knife, right?"" Which ... he totally didn't. Apparently the guy had the knife out, but held down by his waist where he didn't see it, but his take-no-shit rejoinder disarmed (so to speak) the would-be robber, and he didn't push the point. "

Most women who obsess about 5 pounds... it's not that she actually thinks she's fat. It's that if she's gaining 5 pounds and exercising and eating like a bird, she's afraid her metabolism is going to shit and that 5 pounds will soon be 30."

Then, suddenly years later, I look around, girls are *filling their brows* with makeup! What?? If that was the thing when I was a teen I wouldn't have had to worry about doing anything!


Now I love my naturally thick brows, and occasionally get them waxed just to define their natural shape and feel really sharp. Even if the trends change again, I'm simply secure with them, even when they grow out. (Thanks, Emma Watson ❤)"

"Strip clubs. The floors are sticky, the chairs are sticky, the women are sticky (insert teenager joke here). And once they find out you aren't rich you become invisible. I've fallen asleep in more strip clubs than I'd care to admit.

"I remember this one time, several years ago, a group of friends and I were going for a day at the river. You know, kinda hot out, hiking and swimming involved. There were two girls coming with us, and one of them, instead of helping packing or even just socializing before we were ready to caravan down there, spent over an hour doing her makeup in her car. Then when we get down there, she refuses to go in the water, and spends a great deal of time just taking selfies and touching herself up.

Later on, my friend and I judged her pretty hard for that behaviour. Idk why. It's not usually in my nature to judge people for shit that doesn't negatively affect me or other people. Anyway, reading your post has made me realize that there can always more to the story, and that it was wrong of us to think those things about her."
"Your definition of a ""good relationship"" is delusional.  Truly loving someone involves honesty,  respect and commitment.  If you perceive those things as a ""fairy tale"", then you are incapable of a true relationship.  I don't care that you're a whore as long as you're the only one it impacts.  What bothers me is the mentality that someone believes that their ""biological needs"" gives them a free pass to leave collateral damage. Grow up and be honest with people who are foolish enough to think they can trust you. "

"I moved to shanghai and a few weeks after arriving had to call the landlord to send someone to repair the handle/lock to my balcony door in the bedroom. The door wouldnt stay closed. It was rented fully furnished. A few minutes later a guy shows up with a rope and ties it to the door handle then lies down to the floor and ties the other end to a hook underneath the bed. He said something in chinese and took off. 

It worked but I had lot of questions whirring in my head. Was this now repaired? What if i want to use the balcony? How did he know there was a hook underneath the bedframe? Does this happen often? Will he be back? 

During the years in China i saw a lot of weird solutions that after a while you barely noticed anymore. Its exactly like what you see in photos posted online. "

"It's okay he'll just replace her too. After all, young hot women only want to be with disgusting vapid old men like him, it will be fine. "
"I get that and that the social expectations put on men are very different but it's also very difficult being the only emotional support for a man. Women have their friends and family, but imagine one person playing that role. If a woman helps you tap into those emotions -- great! But please look into spreading to the rest of your social life. Other men will want it; be the person you needed. 

There was a great post that explained the connection with male emotional repression (which also comes from cultural homophobia) and the creation of incels. To summarize, some dudes form an emotional connection with a woman while becoming friends, and since they are so emotionally isolated, they confuse and force that to become romantic love. So they feel jilted when they are considered as friends, even if to the girl, it truly was just a friendship."
"Idk, androgenous women are pretty hawt."

"&gt; I am absolutely more attracted to women without makeup.

I mean, to each there own, no hate, but I'm kinda sick of hearing this. Probably because it makes me think of a neckbeard niceguy™ saying it to his crush. If I am attracted to a woman then I am attracted to her. Period. With or without makeup. I think makeup can be great and it's a legitimate art form that many people are into. And like somebody else said, a lot of times when a guy thinks the woman isn't wearing any makeup, she probably is. The vast majority of guys don't know jack shit about makeup. I know I don't, but I watched some Jeffree Star videos recently and it made me realize just how little I know."

Duuuuuddee. A few years ago the same thing happened to me. I worked out religiously for months. Every lift went up at least 50 pounds. In the end I gained 10 pounds total. Which meant I was still underweight lol. It was absurd. Lately I've accepted I'm skinny and just rock climb. It's fun

I’m an accountant, and he was also extremely intimidated by the fact that I am better at math than he is, so basically he was an insecure, sad person.

My best friend growing up was like this. His family built a 7-figure house next door to their first house, which they struggled mightily to sell, so for about 3 years they were stuck paying off two behemoths. It was the same sized lot, and a bigger house, so they ended up having less usable land. Oddly, the interior was so poorly laid out, that they had less usable space inside too. Then they stuffed it with as much “rich people shit” as they could find. Hot tub? Inside and outside! They never used them and the interior one kept causing water damage, because they didn’t properly ventilate the steam. Home theater? Yep. The other issue was they had absolutely no clue how to decorate so you had their living room, which because of the vaulted ceilings took up about half the interior space and made the upstairs cramped, with like random posters on the wall. The house always felt dirty and unkempt and just motley. They were very nice people, they just had no idea what they were doing. Also, they’re long since empty nesters and the parents are still there. It’s a complete white elephant. They’ll never get rid of that monster. "

"Because of the way laws around trees are written, you have to pay for the full value it would take to almost exactly replace the tree (exact age/species, transplanting to the exact location etc). 

Its not just the cost of the lumber or some fine like you might think. Its sometimes adds up to being very expensive. There are cases on /r/legaladvice where an angry neighbor who cut down a handful of trees they didn't like on their neighbor's property had to pay out tens of thousands of dollars. Hundreds of thousands if its a rare species and older tree.

Its pretty interesting because its not something people really think about but some species of trees are expensive as hell."

"I mean, those kinds of tattoos are so aggressive that I would probably question whether I could have a serious relationship with such a woman, but I’d definitely be like, “fuck yeah, I came to the right party.” However, in the unique situation of this conservative woman, she might be doing that because she and her husband have to be super proper all the time in their community but they are crazy swingers on the sly. So it’s hot, but kinda scary. Like I have no idea what this person is capable of. They are probably way more hardcore than me. But I do think butt sex is hot though. "
So height?  I think that's also bullshit.

He steps forward, grabs the guy's arm, and putting his broad, 6'5"" frame to full effect, says, ""First, you give me back my wallet, then I let you run away, screaming and rethinking your life."" "

This was not a regular shit but the dreaded meconium poop (think black tar in soft serve consistency). 

A meter long strip flew at me and was all over my arms and chest.  Whilst I stood there in complete shock, my dearest son decided this was not enough, and proceeded to piss on me.

Whilst mortified at the time, I think it's now one of my funniest memories. "

They seem like genuinely laid back and funny guys. I'd will it beer with them.
"&gt;Its not the getting laid that bothers me its the being single. 

Your not single if your part of a group. I have not had a girlfriend for all thirty some years of life and one thing I have noticed about successful bachelors is they are only alone when they want to be. Otherwise they're always surrounded by friends and family or even just some random person they just met. That's another thing remind yourself that there are plenty of happy single people out there. The wife, kids, picket fence propaganda makes it seems like it's wrong to not have an SO but that's bullshit. There are plenty of advantages of not having a life partner that you always have to compromise with.

&gt;So now that I'm out of college who knows when or if I'll naturally meet someone else and do not tell me about dating apps, they suck. 

Work. Half the married people I know meet there spouse through work. The other half is a friend of a friend.

&gt;I just want to be away from the world and be alone.

You mentioned therapy but does that include medication because all of the posts I've read in this thread kind of makes it seem like you have some social anxiety / depression issues.

There’s always one guy that says this like the overwhelming majority of other short guys are full of shit. 
Ow. That sounds even worse than just being too rough. Friction burns are ech. 
"There isn't much to advocate. Your saying that the majority have a complex about their height. I'm 5'9 i'm neither tall or short and I'm pretty comfortable bout my height. Maybe theres an issue if your a guy shorter than 5'2 (I honestly don't know). My point, is that tallness is considered attractive to many girls, that and average looks will get you a long way. "

Hooked up with a girl on a cruise ship, went back to my room.

Halfway through eating this girl out, from the light of the TV, I notice this girl has a pretty massive birthmark on her leg and stomach area, which is weird coz I definitely would have noticed it before.

I run my finger over it and it comes off. Then I taste blood. I wipe my face on a towel first before letting her know she's bleeding, everything was cool though. 

Blood was soaked into the mattress I had to call the maintenance people to get a new mattress"
"Gonna rant for a bit: Honestly? When it comes to these girls I think it's just them being shallow... that... or girls honestly find it ""embarrassing"" that they're dating someone who's making less money, or think that the guy is somehow a loser for making less.

So I found out recently from a friend that this one girl I was into won't date me *because* I'm only making a certain amount of money compared to her. She tells people that while I'm a catch in some departments, I'm a loser who won't provide for her financially. 

While its true I'm not making much currently: I just graduated from college with a high GPA, am currently studying for the GRE, have been working at a lab in the university for 2 and a half years now studying / working within the field I like, have done paid field research in the arctic for 2 summers now, and am working on writing a research paper to hopefully submit to a scientific journal... hopefully...

Yet in her eyes, despite all of that, I'm still a loser because I'm making ""chump change""...

After that we became really good mates but went our seperate ways the next day. 2 weeks later I saw him on a random island at the full moon party. We partied all day and night for 5 days straight. Got each other’s details and kept in contact. A year later I ended up moving to Sydney for work and I hit him up. 4 years after that I was his best man at his wedding and I feel like if we didn’t jump in that shit pond together, we would never of became best mates.

"I do work for a bounce house rental service that a family member owns during the summer. It’s very labor intensive, and the Texas heat doesn’t help so our employee turnover is pretty high and every summer I come back it’s a new set of guys.
When I come back from college in May, none of the schools (K-12) in my town are out yet, but they’re having their end of the year parties or field days, so it’s really our busy season.

One of the groups of workers had to set up 8 or so bounces at an elementary school. This usually takes a couple of hours but depending on the heat it can really slow some of the unmotivated workers down.

One of the guys let’s call him andrew, says he has to go inside to use the restroom or get a drink or something, which isn’t unusual cause this work is like a death march and if you can get a minute or two in AC then it’s been a good day. Meanwhile everyone is continuing setting up.

Fast forward a couple hours and the event is fully set up and we wait around to make sure everything is staked down properly and the teachers know how many kids are allowed on the bounces.

About an hour into the event three cops cars pull up and immediately come walking over to us. They said there had been a theft at the school we were at and all the iPads from the computer lab had been stolen.

Turns out Andrew snuck into the computer lab on his “restroom break” stole the iPads, and had posted them on Craigslist, and told people that wanted to buy them to meet him at the school.

Dude got arrested and sued by the school district.

TLDR; guy tried to sell iPads on Craigslist that he stole from an elementary school, and told buyers to meet him at the elementary school we hadn’t left yet."

"My daughter was about 18 months old and had the most ridiculously fat baby legs. My wife put her in the cart at Home Depot and proceeded to shop and when she was done, she couldn’t get her leg out of the cart. She asked an employee for help, and it turned into a huge event. They had to cut her out and called everyone, so there’s 20 people there witnessing my daughter getting cut out of a cart. We had to sign the obligatory please don’t sue us papers and I think we could have walked out with half the store. 

This happened a year before my daughter did a half-gainer into a glass purse shelf at Dillard’s. Glass. Everywhere. I thought we were going to be in trouble. Nope. Called the paramedics and the store manager was just convinced we were going to sue them. They were horrified. Daughter was fine.

Eventually some customers would return and ask why they were charged $10-$20 more on their bill.  A short investigation showed that these were all Ron's customers, but camera footage showed Travis fucking with the paper.  Travis gets talked into a confession and is fired.  Don't leave those tickets blank people!  Even if you're stiffing your server and feel bad about it, write the $0."

"It's not inherently insulting in itself. It's just when someone says ""men love it when females..."" or something like that it sounds really weird. It's treating men like people, and women like some kind of alien species because ""female"" is very clinical or scientific language. If instead they said ""males and females,"" it no longer feels as weird (though it is awkwardly formal in some settings and feels appropriate mostly in scientific or medical settings for example) because they are addressing everyone the same way. The problem is acting like women are like animals or an alien or something, which is what some sexist men do. To say ""a female chef"" for example is not inherently insulting. But to say ""Men who are chefs"" but then ""Females who are chefs"" comes across creepy.

Creepy... not necessarily insulting. It suggests something about the person speaking it; that they see men as people and women as something else.

Obviously it is also heavily context-dependent.

TL;DR: It becomes creepy-sounding when both: (1) they call men ""men"" but women ""females"" and (2) they use ""females"" as a noun, like ""Females like to eat ice cream"", not an adjective like ""a female customer"".

"You never know when you're going to die. You might die tomorrow, you might die in a week, you might be dead by this time next year. Hell you might even die in 10 minutes when you go to the bathroom to take a piss and you slip and hit your head on the floor. 

You could die from a car accident tomorrow on the way to work. You could be diagnosed with a terminal disease next month. Completely mundane every day things like a rogue baseball or a flower pot can kill you. None of it would be your fault, but that sucks. You'll die anyway.

You think the guy who was listening to music while taking a walk in his neighborhood and got killed by a reckless driver was anticipating death that morning? Do you think any of the victims of 9/11 or the runners in the Boston Marathon bombing was expecting to die? No, they were just happily and anxiously getting ready to race with all their family and friends watching them or going about their normal workday in their office building. You could die from a terrorist attack at your workplace tomorrow or get murdered in a school shooting next week. There are people who get hit by lightning and get crushed under vending machines and refrigerators. Those people definitely weren't expecting to die in such a ridiculous statistically unlikely situation.

The more you think about it, the fact that you might die at any given moment for any random reason outside of your control is pretty freaky. But nobody ever thinks about death, since it just seems like something that happens to other people. Something you only see on the news or in the movies. Something that might happen to your family members or your friends, but never really to you.

That freaks me out. And even after typing all this I'll probably just walk around tomorrow doing everything I normally do without a single trace of death in my mind. 

You might die tomorrow. You might die today.

Isn't that freaky?"

Hey, here's a new cool plot line, totally gonna be an amazing arc. Oh whoops, we killed the Big bad of that arc. Guess it won't be a thing. But here's another new plot line... Which we also just aborted. But hey, here's... Whoops, aborted again. It was an exercise in anticlimaxes. 

And then they had to solve everything using a rasengan. If they had Naruto battle world hunger, he would somehow have pulled a brand new type of rasengan out of his fucking ass and done it.

Boruto is... okay... It's a return to familiarity. Something a little similar to the old show before it went to shit. But it lacks many of the thematics. It's a much happier show than the original. The original had a certain edge. And it's a slow burn. I know a bigger plot line is coming, but it's developing slowly. "

"More a 'why the f*** did I do that' moment but here goes. This happened yesterday.

So I started a new job this week, and I was invited to go bowling with people on my team from work. In walks a husband and wife that are on my team that I'd been getting to know and they're seemingly looking at me and waving at me, so I enthusiastically wave back. 

Then suddenly they're sticking two fingers up at me as well as their middle fingers, and I'm like 'hey this is weird' because I don't know them THAT well yet but it seems to be a joke so I roll along with it and start sticking my fingers up at them. 

Then the wife comes over to where I'm standing and she starts talking to the guy who was stood behind me and hugs him, and then it hits me.. she and her husband were waving at HIM and showing HIM the finger so basically [I was randomly waving my middle fingers](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ldh0hPT) in the middle of a bowling alley like an idiot.

Don’t soley rely on the door jam as that PSI rating is intended for temperatures between 60°F to 70°F. If your average temperature is higher (i.e., summer) you should lower your PSI to improve the tred wear. In winter, generally, you should have more PSI than the door jam.

"If you get a very very good shower mat and the girl bends over, grabbing the faucet for support, the two of you can go to town standing doggy style. Requires some work to figure out a rhythm, but once the partners learn it, shower sex can become a really fun time. 

Edit: also, by doing it standing doggy style, you both get some amount of hot water. And most importantly, never change positions. The only reason to change positions is to switch to foreplay or to switch to a blowjob or facial. The only sex to do is standing doggy. It's relatively safe and both partners understand what to do.

"It depends how many UTI's they've had or any other issues to cause an overactive bladder, once the bladder muscles are weakened uncontrollable squirting during climax is pretty much guaranteed. The glands that produce some actual female cum are so small that they can only produce like 3ml of fluid at the very most. 

It's also been proven via studies that ""squirters"" empty bladders fill rapidly during sex with urine then give out, the resulting fluid tested as urine with the tiny traces from the actual lady cum glands which is as expected. It would also seem a lot of squirters are often dehydrated because their squirt is clear (due to rapid bladder filling and kidney working) and are used to dark yellow acid piss, this shows low knowledge of health and explains why they genuinely believe squirting is not piss.

Well we did end up having lots of fun together, but not because she was a great wingwoman. In fact, I think the only time she ever helped me get laid was the time she told me that, while she was homoromantic, she was curious about having sex with a boy but had never acted on that curiosity because, well, read some of the comments on this thread for reasons not to have sex with men and then add to that a risk of violence if you don't know them that well. But she really liked and trusted me, so she asked if I'd be willing to fulfill her fantasy of pegging a boy.

"My players had to fight a dragon. They rolled shockingly well throughout the fight and were surprisingly winning. So being in the open I logically had the dragon flee. This was surprising given they were only level 3 and only bad rolls from the dragon had kept them alive. 

Most everyone got an attack of opportunity in or ran as it thrashed out of the tower making it collapse but the half orc barbarian wasn't having any of it.

She had a custom weapon from a special orc bad guy the party had fought. It was essentially a hook on a chain you could throw and drag people to you and her usual greatsword as a weapon. (thus will become relevant shortly).

As the dragon flew up she said she wanted to grapple it. Rolled, succeeded. ""Ok you're holding onto its tail"". She then spent the next couple rounds as this massive dragon flew hundreds of feet into the air climbing to the middle of its back. The dragon was rolling and thrashing trying to throw her off but she rolled great every time and hung in there. Then she wanted to throw the hook and latch it onto the dragon's face or eye. Rolls a freaking 19, hook lodged in dragon's eye and now she's riding it through the air like a venom breathing bull at the world's scariest rodeo.

Then she started hacking at the dragon's wing. At this point she's like 300ft in the air and is expecting this to just be a badass way to kill herself. First attack hits, okay damage. Second attack crits, almost max damage. I say that the wing shears free in a gout of blood, the brittle wing bones splintering under the weighty blow.

Now she's riding an almost dead dragon as it plummets to the earth from a height that would kill anything like a green Slim Pickens planning to go out in a blaze of glory. As the dragon and orc smash into a building in the town the other PCs run there to surely find their friend dead.

Well half orcs have a feature that makes them particularly hard to kill and I figured the spirits she worshiped would be pretty damn impressed by such a move so I gave her one last chance.

Roll a con save with disadvantage. (non-dnd players this means you roll 2, 20-sided dice and take the worse of the two rolls).

First roll is a natural 20. Everyone is laughing saying of only it wasn't disadvantage.

Second roll, another fucking natural 20. Table loses its mind.

The other characters dig through the rubble and among what is left of the splattered dragon they find a barely alive, unconscious half orc barbarian with a giant grin frozen on her face.

I ruled even with healing magic she'd be so wounded she needed a week to recover so the party had to drag her around in a cart for a while.

But thus began the reoccurring legend of Urhe the Dragon Slayer through my games. "
"I feel like this is akin to someone asking you to do a chore when you were already planning to do it in a few minutes. Like, yeah dude, I know. It is my fucking body, and I've dealt with this shit for years... but now I don't want to do it just to be contrary. Maybe I have those issues you speak of..."

"Here, sexed is compulsory and both genders learn the same thing (I went to a public school). They went over basic biological function, a bit of consent (too little imo), puberty, and some things about inappropriate relationships. We were told about contraceptives, mainly condoms I think. This was in primary school, ages like 10-13 I think? In highschool we got a bunch of scaremongering around child porn and drugs. Some stuff about safe drug use, and a bit about contraceptives, particularly plan B. I think it was alright, could do with a bit more, but way better than whatever shit half the people on reddit seem to get."
"I'm only 5'10"" - 5'11"", but drunkenly making out with a girl the same height as me was an absolute revelation. I didn't get any pain in my neck, and I didn't feel like I was awkwardly looming over her. Would recommend!"

"That was the implication of the ending. One of the last things he says is ""This place makes me wonder, which would be worse to live as a monster or die as a good man?"" and then exchanges a look with the doctor. The implication being that he is choosing to be lobotomized rather than live with the knowledge of what happened to his family. "

"This movie’s twist was ruined for my friend group. About 12 of us got together at my place; I had already seen it, and one other guy had already seen it. But everyone else hadn’t. 

Halfway through the movie somebody asked about chronology (“What is happening right now, and what’s a flashback?”) and the other guy answered “The part that’s happening right now is the police interrogating Keyser Soze”. 

Cue everyone looking at him, shocked. His response, after a few seconds, was to go “Oh wait... fuck...”. I spent the rest of the movie quietly trying to misdirect to allow some shadow of reasonable doubt and still make it twisty, but the damage was mostly done."

I was really busy and didn't notice it until about 30 minutes after I'd taken the order, and I already threw their order sheet away. They thought it was just *hilarious* and ended up leaving over 20%. I've literally never in 7 years had someone get angry over me making a mistake and owning up to it. It's always things that I have no control over that people chew me out over, like something being taken off the menu, me being overwhelmed due to understaffing, food taking too long or being cooked incorrectly, etc. Part of me thinks I should just lie and say that these things are my fault."

It was well accepted in my family that every activity I did would be done with a book in my hand if it was physically possible to do (eat, bathe, walk, etc.). It was such a big part of my life and personality, and book impacted me so deeply and meaningfully. I was always in love with a new book.

"This verse always misses the final part which is the most significant in this story, IMHO.  After Jesus says this, everyone except the woman(an adultress, not a prostitute, I thought), and says he does not condemn her either and she goes away(to sin no more).

"Holy fuck do I have a story for you guys and gals. I'm in Italy right now on vacation. So a few nights ago I made the best mistake of my life telling a buddy I met that I was hungry. His grandma overheard... She runs up like a track athlete and invites me to dinner and tells me to be there in two hours. I accept and when I show up there is a massive table full of appetizers. So we start eating and after about 5 minutes she walks in the kitchen and brings out a huge tray of lasagne and gives me a huge slice. It was the best thing ever. So I finish it just as I'm reaching my limit. She assumed that since I finished it that meant I was still hungry... *BAM* another fat slice. *heavy breathing ensues* I manage to get through most of this and I notice his grandma disappeared again. I ask my buddy where she went and he's just like, ""to grab the second course"". O.o So she comes in with steaks and ribs... So I'm looking at this food wondering how the hell I'm gonna do this and she pulls a god damn cake outta the oven and casually says with a big smile ""after this, then cake"". I managed to pull it off and ate every god damn thing she threw at me. It was so fucking good too. But holy shit... I thought I might actually tear a lining in my stomach. They eat like fucking professionals.

Tldr: Italian grandma overheard me say I was hungry. Ate more than the last week combined. "

"Kind of unrelated but some months ago I went to bar with my fiancee and we bumped into my old best friend there who joined us to play billiards etc. What I didn't know was that whenever I wasn't looking or was a bit further my 'friend' would grab her ass, even after she told him to fuck off. She left the bar a bit earlier to sleep and I stayed with my friend drinking for a couple more hours and then he talked himself to coming to sleep to our place. In the morning I heard what happened and it took all my willpower to not punch him, I threw him out and told him to fuck off and never contact us again.

But the feelings you described you felt is what my fiancee also said she was feeling, this guy was my best friend for 20 years, ever since we were 3 years old and he abused that position to do something like that. I still get so angry whenever I remember the whole thing. "
I just watched a GQ video on YouTube where he broke down all of his roles.  That goofball character he does in the rom-coms is nothing like his real personality.  He said the jerk he played in Bridget Jones was much closer to his real personality.  I've always thought he was probably most like the sarcastic loner in About a Boy.
"Their rant is entirely justified.  
  
About nine-ish years ago I was driving back to Las Vegas from Phoenix. I had a little shitty '91 Dodge Shadow with $20 retread tyres on it, because I was poor. While driving down the deserted desert highway, my front drivers side tyre just came apart, taking my entire wheel well and other assorted bits out. I almost went straight off the road but managed to haul myself over into the shoulder.  
  
Just to set the scene, it was the middle of July, it was around 110°F outside, I was on an infrequently-traveled bit of road, and I had no food or water with me except for two cans of Sprite.  
  
I jacked the car up and tried to get the wheel off so I could get the spare on and make it to the next town. However, the force of my tyre coming apart had jammed the nuts on and they wouldn't come off. I kept at it for about half an hour, growing increasingly desperate, when finally I conceded defeat and sat down for a bit to take stock of my situation. There was no shade, it was hotter than Satan's asshole, and there was exactly zero traffic. I popped open the boot of the car, spread an old poncho over the glass and tried to make a little shade for myself while I waited for a car to come by. Naturally, I had zero cellular signal out there.  
  
After a few hours of baking in the sun, I spotted an SUV headed my way. I flagged them down and they pulled over. Half a dozen Mexican lads got out of the vehicle and came over, asking what the problem was. I explained the situation and they got right to work trying to free my frozen-on wheel, but they had the same luck with it that I had. I didn't want to leave my vehicle alone and get stranded somewhere else, so they took down my insurance information and promised to call me a tow when they got farther up the road and into cellular range. We had a bit of a laugh at my situation after one of them told me that when a carload of Mexicans couldn't get a wheel off a car then you knew it was fucked. They hopped back in their vehicle, but not before leaving me an umbrella and a six-pack of Corona. About four hours later, my tow truck arrived and everything was alright. If it hadn't been for those amazingly helpful men, I'd have been well and truly fucked.  
  
Don't buy shitty tyres, friends. Get the good ones."

"2 ER/OR Stories:  


1) Had a pt present and say that he was having abdominal pain, his wife was with him. We take him back, XRay, and we notice a foreign body at the edge of the film. Send him to CT, there was a 30 cm mass that was undefinable (no idea what the hell it is) when reviewed by radiologist. Well, about that time, a second woman shows up at the front desk saying she is the wife of Mr. Doe and is demanding to go back and see him. I go back and tell him this, IT WAS HIS MISTRESS WITH HIM AND THAT WAS REALLY HIS WIFE AT THE FRONT DESK. Turns out, 'ol boy got freaky with his mistress at the HoJo and they stuck a zucchini up there. Yeah, that was a field day to watch the actual wife walk in and ask why we were signing surgical consents.

&amp;#x200B;

2) 54 yo male, AO4 GCS 15 (as awake and alert as you are now reading this, so no dementia or anything like that) complaining of penile pain. 1 XRay later; DUDE HAD SHOVED AN ACTUAL LIVE ROUND RIFLE BULLET IN HIS PENIS!! LIKE ALLLLLLL THE WAY IN. We send him to surgery to have it removed, I camped out and checked the progress of the surgery about every 15 minutes or so. I was making it a point to know when they finished so I could ambush the doc after scrubbing out. I succeeded, and when I asked the doc if they got a ""WHY?!"" answer, Doc's response: ""Hell no we didn't, dude was fucking weird, asked if we could just numb it so he could watch, he didn't want to be completely sedated for it."""

"Yeah, paying off a car loan would hurt your score (types of credit is 10% of your score), but shouldn't be by that much? The only way to really combat it is to watch the other factors. So 35% on-time payment, 15% credit history length, 10% new credit, 30% credit utilization ratio. Pay your bills on time, keep all cards open for now, don't apply for new credit just yet, make sure your utilization ratio is 10% (how much you spend vs how much your available balance is). And you should be good!"

Could it work? Don’t see any reason why not.....how small could we get a normally proportioned, non-deformed human without any mental flaws?

I’d propose the same thing for giants as well. Take the biggest, most naturally muscular humans and breed them with the tallest. See how large of a person you could get without medical issues."

Also Irish pubs in America. I find them to always have weird names, like Paddy O’Flanagan’s or Sean McSeamus’ or something. Most of the pubs I frequent are named after things and titles (The Hill, The Harp, Duke of York, etc.), not the full names of the ‘owner.’ 

Why not call it “Paddy O’Irish-McIreland” if you want people to instantly know it’s an Irish pub?"

"Ooh! I have a story to tell for once!

One year, I was at a summer camp on a college campus. We went to watch a movie at a building about 5 minutes away from our rooms. We started the movie late, so when we were walking back it was around 1 AM. The first crosswalk we reach, one of the camp counselors almost got ran over by these dudes drag racing down the street. Cue an argument between our counselor and the driver of the car. Now, when we were right outside the gate to our dorms, they showed up again and the driver got out and stood between us and the gate. At one point, I think that there was a gun pointed at us. I don't remember what happened next, but someone said something and they took off. Later that night, no one could sleep and we heard gunshots in the distance. Turns out that when they were caught by the police, they tried to shoot at them. "

It is terrible for those truly suffering because it justifies suicide. It blames everyone around her. It shows how everyone is so affected and distraught by this.

Michael is not equipped to be in a relationship with anyone. Holly is constantly shamed for her attempts at maintaining professional boundaries.

"Seriously. The only characters in that show that were likeable were the dark skinned cheerleader girl (I forget their names) and his boyfriend. Like, she was a bit of a bitch to Hannah, but due to a misunderstanding and she felt remorse after. And the guy... he did a terrible, unforgivable thing. But his whole story is just so sad. How he came from a broken home, how Bryce used that to get his loyalty, basically buy him, get him feeling like he owed him, how he used that to take advantage of him and how the guy, in a moment of weakness, allowed it only to immediately regret it. He was the only character with real depth, where you could see his internal strife and anguish, and see him develop and deal with the consequences of his actions in a way that made for a genuinely interesting character. 

Everybody else falls into one of two categories: either a scumbag with no redeeming qualities or a person who makes extremely poor decisions to the point of exasperation. "

I hit her up a week or two later to set something up. She's out of town for work, but is free the next weekend, but I'm busy.

We miss each's other's available weekends again, and the third time I asked her out, she just told me ""No."" Okay, my bad.

About a month later she hits me up and asks me why I never asked her out again. Turns out, she won't go out with a guy until the 4th time he's asked her out - she wants to make sure he's interested. "

It's supposed to be. 50/50 isn't just splitting everything down the middle but a equal share system with equal rights. 

One person makes less? They're probably going to be expected to contribute less unless they're personally against contributing less.

There's hidden costs everywhere. Such as the emotional cost for men lacking the social and emotional support system that could be related to our early deaths due to higher stress levels over the course of our lives.

But we're not talking Feminism. We're talking expectations while dating. 50/50 is a reasonable thing to expect from new people in your life."

"Rules of conversation aren't intuitive to them because they don't passively notice many of the messages the other person is projecting.  Your conversation partner may be uncomfortable or frustrated, as shown by their facial cues and body language; most people will pick up on this and change the conversation accordingly, aspergers will not, unless they're paying attention and they've done social cue training.

Aspergers may have slightly different process rate, but that's likely due to the amount of attention being paid to the topic at hand.  Sometimes people with aspergers put their entire attention into a conversation, often disregarding the aforementioned social cues.  Other times, they may pay little or no attention to the conversation at all, due to all the distractions around them.  Both cases can be frustrating to deal with.  Aspergers tend to require someone really understanding to be their friend."

I was able to get out of bed at 7pm the next day, still drunk. I totally missed i should be somewhere else and I also forgot my phone at that party. So at some point later that night the doorbell rang. I opened and it was her. With her parents. To see if I am alright.
She literally searched about 300 houses for my name (she only knew my last name and the street I was living on, not the number) and her parents helped her. Many people thought that cute, I thought it was creepy. I told her what I do and why. She was not content. She still messages me. I had her number blocked for years now. Changed phones and the number got unblocked because of that. She seems to still send me texts regularly. Every time I unblock the number I receive messages from her again. Kind of creeps me out."

“Mom things” vary I think greatly depending on the situation; you have single moms, moms with one kid, moms with four kids, moms that work, moms that stay home, blended families, etc. 

For me personally, I am a stay at home mom to 5; 4 are biologically mine (7,6,and twin 8 month olds) and the 5th is my 5 year old step-son that lives with us full time. 

My “mom things” include:

- forgetting to shave one leg
- doing bathroom things with someone at the door with a question/problem/fact that dad can handle *just* as well as I can
- buying cold coffee b/c it’ll be cold before I get to finish it anyway
- blissfully taking my time at the grocery store b/c I managed to go alone 
- hiding snacks that I don’t want to share
- avoiding other moms
- being made Public Enemy Number One because I made them try a vegetable/clean after themselves/literally anything they don’t want to do
- wearing the same shirt for days at a time, shamelessly.

I bought into the hype, but just never really enjoyed it. The gunplay never felt right, and I just never found a hero I liked playing. 

I'd play a single game, and then hover over the ""quickplay"" button and then think, ""No, I'd much rather play something else"" "

"Truthfully no.

We have several races between horse and man and the horse rider has to pace the horse right around the same speed as a person and, it is a toss up who wins. So, even when paced, we can keep up with the best running animals on earth. 

And, those races are usually like 20-25 miles. There are several people who have run over 100 miles straight. World Records are like 350 miles. The endurance that can be learned from proper training is pretty insane. If we didn't need to crap or sleep, we could probably keep going until we died from lack of energy (starvation) "

The okder generation is a mostly lost cause. But if you make it easy and put it on the containers kids will learn and do it. To the point of it being second nature."

I can’t stand that forced high pitch valley girl accent that some gay men has chosen to adopt. It just comes off as a fake facade they put on for some unexplained reason. It’s like they want to be a living caricature of homosexuality.

We all write a story in our minds that explain why someone does a thing, when you consider their perspective, you write a story that puts them in, at the very least, a neutral light. It doesn't mean you agree with them, or condone their actions, but it does help you see them as a person, and remind you to be kind.

But then I do this when talking to someone else, and say ""well maybe they did it because ____"" and they get angry, assuming that I'm taking their side if I'm explaining their thought process."

"All used games have a sale price dependant on availability and popularity.  This is why Phoenix Wright games on the DS can cost more than they did when new, but games like Corey In The House can be as low as $0.50. 

Its supply and demand, but as the supply is much slower and restrictive than new stock, the pricing structure can be much more inflated.

Reprints of video games often have special liveries on their covers - think Playstation Platinum and XBOX Classics.  They are reprinted games in the sense that only so many physical copies of a video game are printed when its new.  If the demand is high enough they get reprinted with these covers (and sometimes in GOTY formats which includes all DLC).

These reprints are often sold at budget prices.  I remember Playstation Platinum games were never really above £20.  Even the digital versions of the re-released games are sold at knockdown prices.  Any sales are good sales.

Oftentimes by the time a re-printed game is released; the second hand price of the game is actually higher than the 'budget' re-release.

In the case of non-GOTY games its the exact same game.  They aren't breaking laws by calling it 'used.'  Actually in retail, just opening an item qualifies it as 'used' so technically if they open the cases and reprint original labels it is a used game.  If the original and reprint are the exact same, its not illegal.  Just highly unethical."
"The party had just cleared out a cave full of goblins. Further exploration revealed the chamber in the back where all the goblin women and children had hidden while the warriors desperately defended their home. 

While the other PCs began discussing how to deal with this unexpected discovery, the paladin had checked with me by secret note. Then he strode in, slaying the defenseless creatures with his mighty sword. The other players and their characters were appalled. His motivation - they were evil creatures in his power. Sparing their lives would have violated his paladinly oath. It was a demonstration of how Good is not always Nice."

"I am the youngest, my sister is 4 years older than me. When I was at the age to finally run around outside, my sister had to watch me. If I started to cry, she had to come home. The neighborhood kids were mean to me, so I cried a lot. Naturally my sister hated me for it, she never got to play. 

Eventually my parents caught me teaching myself how to cry in front of a mirror, so let her do what she wanted and I found friends my age that didn't tease me. But man, that first year running around the neighborhood was rough for both of us."

"Spanked? Yes. All the time. Like damn near every day. For really stupid shit too. I used to catch beatings from my dad when he was having a shitty day. And mom would smack me around when she was pissed at dad because I looked like him. All in all it made me sort of a hardass which really isn't that bad. Especially considering that I eventually joined the Army. My entire military experience, from beginning to end, was probably a lot less difficult for me than it was for other people. Drill Sergeant screaming in my face at 2:00 AM? Hell, at least he wasn't half-drunk and wasn't putting hands on me so no big deal. Like at all. Some dickweed in Iraq shooting at me? Fuck it. Drop him and go back to base to play Gameboy. I'm not, or never will, lose sleep over that shit. 

I have a kid now and I've raised him the complete opposite of how I was raised. Every day I tell him I love him and that he makes me proud. And I couldn't even imagine putting my hands on him in anger. I mean I'll wrestle the shit out of the little bastard but I wouldn't spank him for any reason at all. Spanking is the tool of stupid and lazy parents."

Expecting sex from your partner is a fallacy, no matter how you coat it or define it.

Some years ago some guy called a cop a horsedick and the officer charged him with being rude to an officer. Every term for police  other than constable or police is derrived from 'pig' so its illegal to use these terms or be rude to their face. He challenged the case because everyone up there has always gotten away with it. He won and it was decided that people from the north may call a police officer a horse dick."

One day, she rang up a customer on one register. I had been at another register on the opposite side of the counter, and was walking toward hers as she finished ringing up a customer. I saw her put the customer's bills in the register...and the customer's change in her pocket. Needless to say I told my boss ASAP. And thankfully the cameras caught her and they fired her."

Because the administrators were short-sighted dipshits.
"A couple of reasons. Consoles are a great places for roaches as they're dark, easy to get into (the vents), and then get warm from usage. And most people set them up and then don't move them and especially if it's in some sort of entertainment center, you now not only have the darkness of the inside of the console itself but also the console is now sitting in a little nook or something. I actually saw an article about how repair places are finding that the PS4 is like the OPTIMAL console for roaches due to the size of the vents and that that's a common thing for when people bring their console in for repairs. It's broken because bugs are everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason though is that so many of these people stop using their consoles and then just plop them somewhere until they sell it. Like they'll just go set their unused Wii or whatever up in their attic or their basement or their fucking outdoor shed and let it sit there for god knows how long. So now you have the aforementioned luxury bug/roach condo sitting in a place where these kinds of bugs already are and it's like finding luxury real estate. And these people literally don't check the console whatsoever. They'll grab that shit straight from their basement and bring it right into Gamestop.

&amp;#x200B;

MOST people are really understanding about it. All the stores I was it all staff always denied trades over reasons like this and people were cool about it most of the time. But every now and then you'd get some complete dickwad going ""But it works so why won't you just take it???? You can just clean it right????"" Like dude. I'm not taking in a fucking cockroach infested console and the only way to truly 100% know it's bug free would be to take it apart which we don't have the time to do nor the tools to do so. I'd ask these people how they'd feel buying a console infested with roaches and if they'd like buying a product that infested their house and that usually shut them up."

I guess we could ask more often, but girls could tell us more often too. Some positions are a very leg and ab orientated workout. And many of us like variety because different positions feel different in an equally good way (or some positions are good to finish). Also so we don't instantly cum. Do you know how much pressure gets put on many of us? We cum in 9 minutes it's too short, we cum in 10 it took too long.

We used to screw for 1-2 hrs each session. now its about 5 minutes I don't want her miserable doing something she doesn't like. I hate pressuring her for sex in the first place but I'm really worried that I iwll end up cheating on her. I am not very strong willed when I am horny. I know that sounds stupid but it's honestly the truth my mind just kinda takes me to a fantasy land where nothing is real. Very well may be a sex addict, and while we were swingers It's a grey area as far as having sex with other women goes right now and I feel like if I asked her it would really hurt her. She's my baby and if shes not ok with it i'm not ok with it. I have tried to get her to have some fun with other guys thinking maybe she was just bored with me, but she flat out refuses to do that and is just not interested. Sometimes she gets sparks of her old self she will start playing with me, give me a blow job, etc and then all of a sudden just not horny anymore and I'm left horny as fuck from it. Gotta be something that can be done without removing the implant to mitigate her libido. "

Anyways, gave me a almost 10 minute sob story on how he lost his brother to a gang fight, and about how much he missed him. And then proceeded to ask me if I could sell him a PlayStation 3 for $50 off. His mood change was so sudden, that I knew he was bs’ing me.

"It's not sun exposure. Most forms of baldness occur by basically miniaturizing hairs. They don't stop growing; the follicles just shrink down into producing peach fuzz, which is usually translucent on everyone regardless of their dominant hair color. Incidentally this is also how laser hair removal works. It doesn't zap the hairs completely out of existence. They mostly atrophy and shrink down.

My husband was pretty bald for a 25 year old when we met. He's now quite bald by any measure, and it's fascinating to look at his head under intense light. The hairline is still there if you just look for teeny tiny peach fuzz hairs. Bodies are so weird and cool!

Edited to add - d'oh, you mentioned sun exposure. For the love of bob and in the name of all that is holy -- you are bald! Wear hats!!! Terrifying old man liver spots are so terrifying. If you google ""driving cap"" that's the kind of hat my husband has like 6 of. In the car. At his desk in the office. At home. In his gym bag. In his random carry on luggage bag.

"I've got some issues with your comment here. You sound like a rational person who would be receptive to talking about it, so I hope it's cool that I'm going to share my thoughts.

Just because you, anecdotally, can't believe that a majority of men are like this, does not make it so. Maybe you keep with a chill crowd. In that case, good for you. But men as a whole are still incredibly misogynistic. Most of the men a women will encounter would be horrified if she did not pluck her eyebrows or shave her body hair. Many of us are even held to these standards by our fathers. And even if the misogyny isn't that overt, men will say things like ""I need to see what a woman looks like without makeup"" - because women aren't allowed to be ugly, so they gotta check first, right? 

There are so many microaggressions that play into this broader issue, so it's frankly hard to know where to begin. Women exist under an unrelenting male gaze. I cannot exist in public without men viewing me as a potential sexual partner - which, no, is not normal, it's actually part of how men are conditioned by hypermasculinity to be hypersexual brutes. I cannot eat pizza in the break room where I work without a man commenting on my weight, asking if I'm having a cheat day on the diet he assumes I must be on - because women are all worried about our figure, right? A male coworker once told me he was shocked to see me eat doughnuts, because I only weigh about 110 pounds - dangerously underweight for my height. I told him that I have ovarian cancer, and will literally waste away if I don't eat 4000 calories a day. 

His response, without missing a beat: ""Well, you look great.""

I cannot wear a dress without being visibly eyefucked by men younger than me, men my age, and men older than my father. I cannot wear loose jeans and a flannel shirt without being asked if I am sick. I have been honked at and catcalled almost every day as I walk to the bus stop. And every woman has experienced all of these things since we were children. I remember the first time a man followed me home - I lived in a ""safe"" suburb. I was 11 and tall for my age. But even though I was a child, and still spent my free time pretending I was a harry potter witch, I knew I could be raped. And yes, I said the *first* time. The gaze is constant and unrelenting. 

The second problem you're describing is internalized misogyny. Women are conditioned to hold themselves and others to these standards of beauty, because of that hypersexualization we experience from birth. So many women who have not analyzed this issue within themselves, who have not worked to undo this conditioning, act as agents of - yes - the """"""""patriarchy"""""""", a colloquial term to refer to the intersection of the agressions above and their effect on whether we are viewed as competent or independent enough to do the same jobs or activities men do."

I can blow an office workers monthly salary on a single dinner.  I have been working full time since I was 16 and I'm never going to forget being in service jobs, etc so I always tip like crazy and am polite and friendly as possible, but I still get many reactions from ranging from ""this idiot is terrible with money"" to ""good for you"" to just seething anger or jealousy.

I hate seeing an attractive girl who has fucked up her brows, removed her lip hair, or shaved her arms, especially if she clearly would have had beautiful thick brows or a nice fuzz. Yeah it's a partialism but it's one millions of guys have. Plucked brows or a waxed lip are actual deal breakers for me. Thankfully college and European girls are trending towards anti-depilation everywhere. The natural look is more youthful and easier to upkeep but admittedly only works with the confidence usually found in very attractive people. "

On the other hand, I wear lip gloss because i love the colors and shine. I wear lip gloss almost every day, whether I'm going out or staying in. Same with highlight. (I am OBSESSED with highlights they're so fun... my god.) 

So some of makeup is purely just for fun and for me, and some of it is for the image i present to the world. I think it's that way for most women."

You might not be very good at sex at first, but lots of experienced people are also not good at sex either, so don't worry about it. The most important thing, anyway, is that you communicate well and are attentive to your partner's needs and reactions, because everyone likes different stuff.

1000% this. Don't tell people. Honestly. If you find yourself in a serious relationship, tell them. But anything else, just no. People are going to hook up with you because they want a good time. Telling them it's your first time makes things waaaay too heavy. It's really not a big deal. If you're good at foreplay and attentive to your partner they will enjoy sex with you after you get through the minor hurdles of figuring out the minor mechanics of it. Everyone knows how sex works.

"Yeah. That was a big, big part of it. And honestly really inexcusable. I could understand being mad about how intense the fans could be. But being mad that we were girls??? Sorry that we spent tons of money on you while having vaginas. Whoops. 

Also in the article they sort of joked about having sex with fans and having three-ways. It was naive of us to assume that a bunch of young boys wouldn’t do that when they had such easy access to it, but obviously it’s kind of heart breaking to have this pristine image of these young boys really abruptly change with one article - especially in one that was kind of crude. 

Another big factor was Luke Hemmings girlfriend Arzalea - who was legitimately nuts. I know fangirls are notorious for antagonizing the girlfriends of band mates. But Arzalea was genuinely just...something else lol. And not at all in a good way. I could rant about her and all the bullshit she pulled for hours. 

Ultimately, they were so focused on being a “real band” that they kind of ruined their band. They didn’t write their own songs I don’t think, and their whole image was very artificial. If they wanted people to have taken them more seriously, I feel they should’ve made both their work and their presences far more personal and authentic - rather than begging for male fans. "

I don't know how the rules work--this was one encounter several years ago, but it sounded great. Each gig she took lasted several months, she pocketed the whole fee because room and board were included (because on a ship in the middle of water far from land). Then she would travel till the money ran out, then take another gig. She had been all over Asia. "

"Well in reality, each of their death's have been a turning point in the show. Most series will kill off a character, mention that in the next episode and never mention it again.

"Economically speaking, trade deficits are a *good* thing. When we export more than we import, we give out more goods than we get in return. On the other hand, when we import more than we export, we get a lot more goods in return compared to what we have to give away.



The amount of flak I've gotten for saying that has been insane, but to me, it is total common sense. A trade deficit means that we are getting the most bang for our buck.


EDIT: I should clarify that trade deficits are good when they are a result of free-floating exchange rates. I’m not suggesting that we should tax exports to create an artificial deficit (that would be completely ludicrous!)."

How to kill a man's confidence for dummies
Do women know about shrinkage?
Why thank
"Goal 1: don't focus on girls/girlfriends.

Goals 2 and 3: do things in life because they make you better able to get girls/girlfriends.

Real talk, coming from a dude that has had the gym as a top priority in life for the majority of it now(started lifting in 7th grade, 32 years old now): you will hate the gym if you do it for vanity alone. You may put on a facade that you don't or build up a coping mechanism of sorts because it can indeed help attract women, but fulfillment is a totally different ballgame.

Goal 1 is 100% the truth, you can't live life worrying about what women want, or what they think about you. That doesn't mean you should ignore relationships and opportunities and compromise within those as they come up, and it certainly doesn't mean it's easy, finding yourself and being really secure in who that is is probably the hardest thing in life but you have to do it or even when you do find women it will be some fake shit you're trying to make it out to be instead of anything real."

"You wouldn't know what alpha was even if someone smacked you up side the head with the first letter of the Greek alphabet.

An alpha would never actually refer to themselves as an alpha because everyone already knows it and they don't give a fuck.

Only fucking insecure losers refer to themselves as 'alpha'. "
"I feel you. The same thing happened to me. When I was 14 I used to spend tons of time styling my hair, and spent years in denial that it was thinning and receding. Finally at 17 there was no denying it, especially when others started commenting.

The worst part for me was how for so many people it became my defining feature. Who's cruftbunny? He's the bald guy. 

I got really depressed about it and wore a hat all the time. I wouldn't bike with a helmet because I didn't want to be seen between taking the helmet off and putting the hat on.

Shortly after high school, I started reading baldness support forums and the universal suggestion was shave your head. So I did it. 

I immediately started feeling more confident and felt secure enough that I could get on with my life. It was maybe the best decision I've ever made.

 Shortly after that I met my first serious girlfriend, lost my virginity, played in bands and performed stand-up comedy. When I had hair I was too shy to raise my hand in class or talk to girls. The best things that ever happened to me were as a bald man. Losing my hair didn't make those things happen, but it didn't hold me back like I thought it would.

Yeah, it sucks I never got to dye my hair crazy colors or grow it out, but honestly there are so many more (and more meaningful) things in life to enjoy."
"Well over a decade ago, in High School, I watched a completely randomly selected innocent teenager get hit in the face with brass knuckles by a drunk bastard - that was bad.

Also, kind of mild, but I saw a girl bet a random guy that he wouldn't go down on her in the middle of a party in front of 30+ people - he did, everyone stopped and watched. It was really awkward. "
"Honestly being part of the mlp fandom was what got me through my freshman year of college. I went to a college out of state and didn’t know anyone, so I resorted to the internet. I stumbled across a reddit thread containing a documentary about the brony thing and decided to give the show a chance. It was a nice show, gave me some good vibes, Daniel Ingram is a fantastic composer and producer, and the music that was made for the fandom really resonated with me due to it’s unpolished, amateur nature (I was just learning how to produce music and it made me excited to hear something out there that wasn’t perfectly created that people still enjoyed). I then got involved with some of the online communities (shout out to /r/mlplounge!) and met some great people who I played games with, had conversations with about life, and connected with. If it hadn’t been for those individuals encouraging me to keep my grades up in school and go to class irl, I probably would have dropped out of college my first semester. The mlp fandom will always have a special spot in my heart because of that. It’s been like 5 years but I don’t ever regret being a part of it despite the weird shit that went on. There were some truly wonderful people that really embraced the show’s message of love and tolerance for all."
"When I was younger I had a nightmare where I was being chased by two serial killers. Long story short- they caught me. They stabbed me in the heart, and I could feel the cold steel plunge through my skin, then muscle, clip a rib, and then feel my beating heart pressing into the tip of the knife. Right as it reached my heart, my extremely loud alarm clock went off.

I spent the next minute grabbing at my chest to find the wound, all while my heart was racing and I was freaking the fuck out, and then I finally realized it was just a dream."

"The PvE Survival gamemode was in development for years, yeah, but the free-to-play Battle Royale gamemode that everyone is referring to when they talk about Fortnite was literally created to compete with PUBG.

Seeing its rapid growth and commercial success, Epic Games saw the opportunity to create a battle royale mode of their own. Originally released as part of the paid Fortnite game, Epic spun out a dedicated version of the game offered as free-to-play funded by microtransactions

"A friend of mine did did this and was cleaning off the motor for a yacht one day. The guy who owned the boat was drinking on the boat with some friends at the time and decided to turn the boat on to show them how it works. My friend then got chopped up by the motor and died...

"It is pretty true most wouldn't shoot you. Unless they're on some drugs or something, they usually just want your cash and nothing else, they probably aren't emotional enough to fuck up and shoot you just because you didn't give them your 30 bucks. Killing or hurting people attracts police, the last thing they want. Same thing as robbers who completely avoid houses with people in them, they want to avoid confrontation at all costs, they just want money. Like the guy from OP probably wasn't someone who desperately needed the money enough to try to pawn off the watch and so felt empathy for the guy, since he was already robbing him and everything. Plus, if the person just resists giving you something, you're better off taking what you got and running away rather than fighting."

"On at least one occasion the latter actually worked out :)

In the early 60s General Electric went out on their own to produce their first diesel-electric locomotive, the four-axle U25B (the B being AAR-speak for 2 powered axles in a row, per truck). Well one day a GE salesman meets with a heavy haul client, and a deal is struck to purchase a handful of U25-series locomotives with *six*-axles (better for heavy haul usage than four). The salesmen triumphantly returns to the factory only to be told that such a locomotive does not exist...

Rather than lose the sale, GE cobbled together what was dubbed the U25*C*, essentially a six-axle Franken-loco of U25B bits. It was good enough that other railroads wanted some too, and about 100 of them were produced before the design was superseded 2yrs later."

"I worked in a supermarket in the late 80's/early 90s that let us buy beer underage after our shift was done, but we were warned never ever to steal. 

One night I get called in by the owners and I find myself in an empty warehouse with just one other staff member. The owner explained that one of us had been stealing beer by putting it in the garbage bag/dumpster, and either one of us would fess up, or we would both receive a beating. 

He overtly said, then you can go home and say whatever you want, cause I know you are not going to tell your parents you got a beating when caught stealing beer. 

Well shit, I had not stolen anything ( I was scared of my parents catching me and would have paid for it if I had been brave). We stood there for like ten minutes (likely 3) and finally the kid next to me burst into tears and admitted it was him. 

Holy crap, never so relieved in my short life. They patted me on the back and told me to go home. Never saw the other kid again, never really told anybody the story (not suggesting he was deaded or something, I assumed they just fired him/scared him)

Every now and then I stop in to grab something there, its the only store for miles (at my grandma's) and I always look back at that warehouse door and remember. "

Then, when you're on a treadmill, they tell you to do a ""base,"" which is the green zone, which is a base speed that you can maintain for a good amount of time.  They also tell you to do a ""push,"" which is the orange zone that you have to struggle to maintain for any length of time.  Then there's ""all out"" where you are in the red zone, where you struggle the whole time to maintain it at all.  They set up routines based on that to either work on endurance (a lot of push, interspersed with base), strength (usually that will involve more incline on the tread mill), or performance (a lot of all out with walking rests between sets).  There's also the power walking option where you keep a constant fast walking pace and just increase the incline to make it harder."

"While WaterPiks are very popular and a good supplement to flossing they are not an actual replacement for standard flossing.

Take it from me, someone who got 4 cavities despite brushing and using a Waterpik. All of my cavities were in between my teeth, and my dentist told me it was because it wasn't a replacement for flossing."

"What a lot of people fail to realize is that in many ways, we are *already* living out a post-apocalypse. We've had empires collapsing and entire peoples wiped out, and...our species bounces back pretty quickly. The Early Middle Ages of Europe is only really called the 'Dark Ages' because it was the few centuries of Europe following the collapse of a centuries-old empire...but more and more historians find that term misleading because people lived through that. Most people lived through that and weren't even directly affected, they just went from being 'Romans' to being people of smaller countries or city-states. They were still *there*.

And I can't find the link but an author once pointed out that many indigenous and Native peoples in colonized countries are basically *already* living out the after-effects of an apocalypse. Most Native Americans were wiped out via genocide and had their land taken by invaders from another world they didn't even know existed until those invaders showed up on their metaphorical doorstep and wiped them out with a devastating virus (smallpox). That's the premise of basically every over alien invasion story in science fiction, and *indigenous peoples are already living it*."

"I went to school with a guy who I kind of befriended because in my mind he would be the person most likely to shoot up our school. This was middle school from 1996-1998, right in the time frame of a lot of school shootings. He didn't come across as violent, but he said a lot of weird things and had a fascination with torture. Always wore black, painted his fingernails and most people outside of his circle swore Billy would eventually go crazy. I learned a bit about his music, Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, Marilyn Manson, Tool and Skinny Puppy and would talk to him about things not related to torture. He always said I wasn't like most of the other jocks, I was cool and didn't try to conform to the bullshit. I mean, he was right, I personally listened to a lot of ska and punk but would also rock a Packers or Gators jersey some days. He got expelled in 9th grade for bringing a knife to school with the intention of using it on his math teacher, who in all honestly was a dick who only treated the popular kids or smart kids fairly. One of his best friends was another friend of mine and she said his intention wasn't to bring the knife, he wanted a gun but his grandpa who he lived with kept them locked up. 

Last I checked he is in prison for assault.

Edit: Looked him up on the DoC page, 2 burglary counts, 2 aggravated burglary counts in our county and a felonious assault in another county where I'm assuming he was locked up in another facility. Been in there since 2011 and will be out in 2021."

"Some friends and I used to call this the Disney Syndrome. 

Essentially little girls for decades have been conditioned to believe that they are princesses and all worthy men are hunky knights. These people are typically delusional to the outward appearance. They believe that they rank high on societies scale for beauty. These women wait and wait for their knight in shining armor to arrive, but have already passed up a great deal of potential suitors because they aren't theyir type. Eventually said princess gets older and desperate. Most relationships from here, if any won't last the test of time. A good portion of those who don't find successful healthy relationships grow old and become the wicked step mother."

"I see where you and your so are coming from, but a lot of these roles are ingrained pretty deeply in society. It wasn’t until recently that women were entering the workforce on such a large scale (past 30-40 years or so). 

Many people still hold notions of traditional gender roles and see house chores as womanly roles. 

I think it’s more about discussing it openly and being willing to address the situation instead of letting it fester. 

Also, to your SO point. No one asked her to do it, but that’s not the point. Even if the roles were gender reversed, the point is if the person didn’t do it, then it wouldn’t get done because the other partner isn’t even thinking about it. "

"Girlllll. I thought I hated fingering. It was a tolerable part of foreplay until I met my ex and BOY did he ruin it. 5 years of him insisting *this is how you do it*.  Got fed up eventually and told him to never put a finger in me again. And eventually never ANYTHING in me again :) 






But then there’s my current headache. He’s much older than me, 40, and I’ve kind of wondered if it’s because his teenage years were mostly just before internet became popular. He didn’t “learn” about sex through shitty porno’s, he learned by fuckin. His fingering is mind blowing. Same with anal, which I had sworn off due to my ex as well. I try to take notes of what exactly he’s doing but it’s like his entire body is just coated in magic. He’s so emotionally unavailable and I love him unfortunately. But the sex is just too god damn good to let him go 😪"

"I recall some really stupid videos stating that this is a failproof way to get a girl to continuously cum in a state of giddy ecstasy and squirt like a lawn sprinkler.

Same here. I was in 1st grade playing in my friends gated front yard sometime after Halloween when a car pulled up and some guy asked if we wanted his leftover Halloween candy. I remember him trying really hard to get us to come closer. I froze and stayed sitting on a little bench they had close to the house. My friend ran inside yelling mom and he sped away. This was in about 2001. Creepy ass people out there.

"My cousin ran up a ton of debt right after college living in Florida, traveling around, partying, etc. He declared bankruptcy and had pretty much nothing left in his name except his condo. He told the family he wanted to retire while he could enjoy it, then work the rest of his life. His credit would get back where he needed it eventually since he was so young. Kind of makes sense.

While having fun, he met some people that knew he was a good golfer and owned a very nice golf course. They offered to let him live in an apartment right off the course and pay for his Pro training. He took them up and is now a golf pro at the course. Works 3 days a week and mostly just rides around with rich old men keeping them company as they play a round while having free golf and housing. He is pretty much living his entire life as a retiree.

"Something that helps is to try to remember all the embarrassing stuff you remember other people doing. Except for some extreme cases, I can’t really remember all the embarrassing or awkward stuff I’ve seen people do. When I do remember I don’t really judge the people that did negatively. In a lot of cases, I remember those things fondly and find the people endearing. In much the same way other people probably don’t remember all the embarrassing stuff I’ve done. And even if they do, I doubt they could be harsher on myself than I am."
"It makes absolute sense. Pre-marital sex was extremely frowned upon until the 20th century. Due to religious reasons, society expected people to only have sexual intercourse while married. It'd be shameful (and sinful) if they didn't, and the only way to restore the honor would be that the couple get married.

Now, men especially of a higher class, like Jamie, could get away with extramarital sex. A woman wouldn't, especially if she got pregnant. Jamie's values would never allow him to do that to a girl. He's a genuinely nice guy, even naif from our poinr of view. If you see more of the show, there are more examples of his ideas about sex, and the problems of extramarital sex in that society."

"Please take my advice with a grain of salt, but having lived while two who loved me did not, I have some advice. You don't have to be strong all the time. If you refuse to cry in front of folks, make excuses, and wail in the car, but you owe no one any emotion. Cry if you need to, don't hold it in, it will take longer to heal if you do. 

I have learned to put a limit on my grieving time as well though. I set a timer, and listen to music that I know will make me dig it all up, collapse on the floor and let it all out. When the timer is up, I sniffle, collect myself, and go watch a TV show with people more messed up than me ie Cops, Revenge, Nip/Tuck etc. When I feel a little better, I watch something that makes me honest joy like Duck Tales. 

I started with a cycle an hour, then every two, etc. The thing is, when you love someone and they leave, they take a piece of your soul with them, and just like any open wound, it will take time to heal, longer because it's on the inside. Hugs."

"Remember Stussy clothes?

In coastal Australia, where surf brands were massively fashionable, but comparatively expensive, the local dollar store equivalent got in a huge shipment of fake Chinese Stussy t-shirts.

Chaos ensued.

Some of the popular girls realized that the tags were different, though. Authentic Stussy shirts had a recognizable Stussy logo on the tag, while the knockoffs just had a generic tag. They promptly formed The Stussy Inquisition, and their inquisitors went around the school (at that stage years 10-12, the final years of high school, wore street clothes, rather than uniforms) identifying heretics. They weren't called poseurs, but the intent was there.

The bitches used to size up my knockoff t-shirts, and those of some others, with the gleaming eyes of fanatics, going insane that they were too afraid to demand we show them our tags, and lacking sufficient male muscle to make us take the tag test, because we were outside of their little caste system, the stoners and weirdos, and we had absolutely nothing to lose socially.

It got so bad, and the bullying so intense--branded surf clothing was, after all, the identifier of the wealthier, more popular girls and the natural order of things had been overturned--that Stussy clothing was banned from school outright."
"I had a similar experience but a few years ago. I'm only seventeen myself, and in eighth grade I joined my school's pole vault team. I became obsessed. Practiced almost constantly everyday and talked about nothing but pole vault for months. My team mates quickly became annoyed, and excluded me from their social group. This led to many nights of no sleep, thinking about what I did wrong. All I did was talk about something I enjoy. And no one said anything about why I wasn't included in anything. Thankfully this also led to me being more extroverted, and now I'm on great terms with all of my team members. "

That's honestly the best explanation I can come up with too. We never had any negative interactions directly or indirectly outside of that event. The lie also painted her in a bad light by admitting to attempting to circumvent security procedures and engage in sexual misconduct when none of it was even necessary. All while there were witnesses that I escorted her to her destination and didn't give her any access codes. So trying to inflate her ego is the only thing I can grasp. I just hated that she chose such an irresponsible and hurtful way to try building herself up.

"This is really not a good policy to have as a guy. you should always assume that she cannot orgasm from penetration alone, as this is going to be true the vast majority of the time. it only happens consistently for about 20-25% of women. (Women fake a LOT, particularly during casual encounters.) If you aren't including her clitoris, you are doing it wrong. Nearly all women experience the most pleasure from clit + vagina stimulation at the same time, even if she happens to also be able to get there via penetration alone.

"My cousin was arrested as a suspect in the strangulation of a young girl. They were friends for a few years. He was the last person seen with her on public transportation. When i first heard the news i was very upset. Not so much shocked because I've come to the conclusion that the men on my dad's side of the family all suffer from some undiagnosed mental and/or emotional illness. This includes myself. My grandfather was an alcoholic, my dad is a drug addict. My uncle had a mid life crisis in his early 50's and just left his entire family one day. No warning, no hinting where he was going. My other uncle, like me, can be very sensitive and aggressive in situations that don't call for it. Since ive realized this ive tried very hard to watch my mood and temper. Ive ended up in the ER with liver damage due to alcoholism. I quit drinking, but now i think i may be dependent on marijuana. Anyway, after hearing about what my cousin is accused of doing, i started hearing more stories about him from our family. Apparently one day in college he tried to kill his brother and roommate by stabbing them dozens of times. They say he was high on a drug cocktail. Now im scared for his life if he's convicted because it's possible he has a mental illness like my brother. My brother was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder when he was 18. By the time he was 25 he was a diagnosed schizophrenic. I think a lot of that had to do with abuse from our father. We are pretty fucked up over here. "

So maybe check over your shoulder every now and then, but don't lose sleep watching for knives, if you know what I mean.~~

"I think that keys are super impressive. It's an item that you use for your house, car, work, etc. (usually) at least once a day and the actual mechanics of them aren't really thought about.

And pompous, proud delight -

Emboldened by banality,

And self-important trite.

'All-right,' I said - 'I'm gone, and glad.'

She turned with dark dismay.

'You see - your worst is really bad.

Regardless of what you want, cumming on an unexpecting woman without her consent is wrong. You can jizz in your pants by yourself or with a woman who is cool with it. Just cuz I sell you a dance does not infer that you can cum on me, when the agreed payment is for a Dance. If it's for a dance and for you to cum, then go for it. But boundaries my man, they're important, so is consent. "
"Yeah after the whole #metoo movement, the boundary is pretty simple. If I approach you and you seem disinterested, I'm going to walk away and I WILL NOT TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

"It’s going to get so much worse too, unfortunately. As the boomer generation rushes into its silver years and start to require more care and effort, expect these cases to skyrocket. 

I worked as a chef in a retirement community that had an assisted living side. You had to be a millionaire to live there, 10k+ monthly living bills and the like. So these are the kings of their industry style residents, being directly cared for by people making under 10$ an hour. People that got in trouble for taking the coupons from the newspaper that would go to the common room area. The residents were used to leading all their life, but now that they can’t and need help with the basics they are belligerent about it, as to be expected. And the staffing was apathetic and avoidant on its best days. The amount of times I watched my management go outside and walk around the building to avoid being seen in the halls was staggering. 

Valid complaints were often brushed off as “Oh So-and-so?  He has dementia of course he’s mad. He will be fine”. Except that was managements excuse for most things. Wrong diet for a resident? Well clearly the residents wrong, unless their family complains and then it’s the base level employees fault. 

We never had severe physical abuse for the five years I was there but off the top of my head the things that did happen were: lots of jewelry stolen, medication made a nice old lady into a weird sex hag and was a laughing point for staff, verbal abuse in terms of yelling, emotional abuse in terms of making a resident with severe Alzheimer’s make animal sounds, moderate levels of neglect from apathetic management, financial abuse by family siphoning off their parents accounts, and alleged physical neglect/abuse in that a resident got dropped off a bed during a rotation by nurses. For everything but management being lazy assholes and the one house keeper robbing jewelry the appropriate actions were taken, employees terminated/ect. And then the time a 102 year old lady got removed because she outlived her money, not technically abuse but damn depressing. 

TLDR; bad shit happens even in the best establishments. If you’re putting your parents in one or hiring a care taker, do your research and talk with employees and look at their job postings. You wouldn’t want your mom/dad moving into a place with higher turnover and less standards than fast food after all. "

"Typically it's not actually the fact that they prefer to hang out with guys. It's the reason they would be prompted to say that. Often an unhealthy sense of obsessiveness, competition, or general hostility towards other girls, etc. could spark this line. Alternatively, they could be uncomfortable in their own skin and immature, thus leading to them seeking a situation with more control instead of accepting their current situations and becoming a more well-adjusted, confident person.

So again, it's not a red flag if they enjoy hanging out with guys vs. girls, it's the spoken phrase that can indicate some underlying issues."

"Years ago I bought a Dell XPS 720 desktop PC from someone selling it online.  At the time it was the newest high end gaming rig Dell sold  (weighed 70 lbs!) and was pretty expensive to buy new.  Everything was brand new in the Dell boxes - monitor, keyboard, etc, and the boxes were still sealed, they never opened any of them.  The price was really good so I was suspicious.  I asked why they would buy a high end gaming setup and then sell it.  Turns out they won it and had no interest in keeping it.  They gave me all the paperwork to back up how they got it so Dell would give me the warranty.

She told me they (husband &amp; wife) are ""sweepers"".  They enter every contest/sweepstakes/drawing they can find, and by doing so at such a high volume they win a lot of stuff.  She was really into it and started telling me how they search for available contests and all the things they've won.  Her husband was unloading the boxes out of their SUV (we met in a public parking lot) as she was going on about it.  When he heard he telling me how they go about it he shut her down pretty quick.  Didn't want the wife giving away any secrets I guess."

"True story from my work.  I’m a software engineer but I had to take over our IT department for a couple of weeks.

G = 20 year old girl from customer service who spends an absurd amount of her time using technology to be so unfamiliar with it

M= Me

G: “Hey my computer isn’t working; it just stopped working.”

I’m 90% sure she even semi-joked about it “blowing up”

M: “Yikes.  Let’s see what I can do.”

I’m expecting death.  Like some hardware shit just exploded.  Nope. We go over to her department and take a look at her computer.  Everything is fine.  There are browser windows, excel sheets, everything’s normal, and I notice that her Microsoft error reporting window is open.  Very typical to have Microsoft suite crashes (at least on OS X, which is what she is using).

So I’m just kinda like looking for a problem for a couple of minutes. And I ask her in the nicest way possible like, “What the fuck am I doing here? Are you fucking okay do you need something else from me? “ and she’s like, “it’s not fixed” and so I ask her what she was doing when she had a problem, and she finally explains that her Microsoft Outlook is “gone”.

Really.... so I just spotlight search that shit that’s still on her machine and pin it to her dock, and she’s like, “wow thank you so much”

Fuckin hell man I don’t understand"

"Eh, maybe I'm wrong but I always get the impression that most ""rich person problems"" are self-inflicted anyway. Like, just because you *can* afford some extravagant lifestyle or a downpayment on a boat or some shit, doesn't mean you *should*.

Obviously I'm not counting the shit that money just *can't* solve, like mental health or shitty family or personal issues. But people are going to have those regardless of whether they're rich or poor, so obviously being in the ""money is no longer an issue"" camp is going to put you in a position 1000x better than anyone else.

I guarantee you, if I could maintain my current lifestyle, but never have to work a day in my life and yet still have the means to take care of myself, I would be pretty much set. As, I would imagine, most people who don't just immediately go crazy with money or try to live above their means.

Don't have to burn the majority of my waking hours every week selling my soul to some faceless corporation? Fuck, money aside, that's a huge stressor and mental tax lifted right there, not to mention all the time that I would get back to pursue my own hobbies. Hello, motivation and self-fulfillment.

Not having to worry about random medical bills or shit. Get injured? Fuck it, go get it squared away. Car break down? Buy a new one. Out of shape? Get a personal trainer. Want to eat better? Take a cooking class.

I'm honestly curious what sort of ""new"" problems money would bring that aren't 100% self-inflicted or aren't the same problems that poor people would encounter too. If money was no issue, there's nothing forcing you to dramatically change your standard of living to an extent that you're introducing all these new problems onto yourself.

Even though I'm fortunate enough to be at a point where money isn't a major *direct* concern (I'm not living paycheck-to-paycheck and have some savings and disposable income), I'm damn sure that it's the *indirect* source of just about every concern I have, whether it's my job or worrying about something broke on my car or dealing with people that I would rather just not deal with..."

"I rode the school bus until senior year of high school.

In junior year, one of the sophomores asked me on the bus what my name was. This was at the beginning of the year. And I could've told him, but instead I told him to guess. He said Austin. I decided harmlessly to tell him ""no, but it's close. It's Houston. Texas cities, ya know?"" Note: My name is *not* Houston, nor is it my middle name or anything anyone could remotely associate with me.

Because this kid was a year below me, he didn't share any classes with me and had no way of knowing if I was lying. And why would I lie? So he just accepted it.

I started crafting an elaborate backstory for myself. A few weeks later, I casually mentioned that I was an Orthodox Jew. This guy was pretty religiously Christian, so this kinda threw him off for a bit, especially after I told him that the New Testament reads like poorly edited fanfiction. A few weeks after that, I told him that I had lived in Tennessee (where this whole thing takes place) ever since my family's deli burned down in Brooklyn, which is the most stereotypically Jewish thing I could think of. He accepted this story and a month later, he introduced me to one of his friends on the bus as ""that Yankee Jew.""

For the record, I'm Anglican, and I lived in California before Tennessee, but I didn't see any reason to tell him that.

I then started hinting that I was gay. I'm not, but I knew it'd bother him even more and since realizing how religious he was, my mission was to hit him with as many stereotypes as possible and seeing if he'd buy them, hence the Jewish stuff. I would make eye contact for a bit too long, I'd put my voice up half an octave around him, stuff like that. I wasn't sure if he was buying it until I walked off the bus one day, wished him goodbye, and was promptly texted by my friend on the bus that the guy had loudly exclaimed ""Dude, that guy is *GAY.*

I started driving to school in senior year. I didn't get a chance to talk to him much and keep messing with him, but the aforementioned friend started working at a grocery store with the guy. When prom season began, I started telling my friend to tip him off I was looking for a date.

For the next few weeks, I'd walk up to him, breathing as if I were nervous, then walk away like I lost my nerve. Eventually, after doing this maybe a dozen times, I finally cornered him and said I had an important question to ask.

He was clearly uncomfortable but he said ""okay"" anyway, probably not to be a dick.

I pulled out my phone and showed him a picture of me in a tux, then my real date's dress, and asked him if he thought the colors would match.

He got really confused, then said, ""wait, I thought you were gay.""

To which I replied with something like, ""What? No. *No.* Look man, I'm flattered you feel that way about me and whatnot, but that's not the way I swing. You gotta shut down those feelings for me, man.""

He was speechless, so I added, ""For what it's worth, I'm not Jewish either, if you were wondering.""

He managed to say, ""Yeah, right, Houston.""

""That's not my name"""

"Men do care, but the data overwhelmingly suggest that women care way, *way* more about their male partners being both tall and taller than them.

The modern ideal for western women, however, is much harder to achieve once you get past a certain height. Things don't scale linearly, and that's actually true for tons of size-related matters in the universe - like, basic physics'n'shit.

But I digress: it's terribly unhealthy to be a waif at 6'5"". At 5'1"" it's not even really a yellow flag at a doctor's office. The non-linearity of it is a serious, serious bitch for women that are close to the threshold.

But then, not all men like waifs, so really, there's not much to be concerned about. The best advice is to lean into your body type to accentuate it for those who are inclined towards it anyway. Exceptions do apply if you believe your body type is ""sphere."" I'll believe it when I see the X-ray."

He was playing video games with his headset on and said he heard the loudest fart coming from me OVER his headset. We both just laughed and laughed. It was super embarrassing but I still chuckle to myself every once in awhile that I was the first to break the ice with farts. I still giggle like an 8 year old when one of us lets one slip out unexpectedly. "
How do I super upvote?!!
"YES. I think Leonard could have been played just as well by another actor, but not Sheldon. Parsons was born for that role."
Sometimes it's hard to draw a line between people that only like chill bars vs people that like dancing in clubs. The group I've been hanging out with does like chill bars but also really likes dancing. So they do both. I'm just very much not fond of the clubbing portion and feel weird leaving halfway through the evening while everyone else stays and bonds.

"I do a lot of contract work for one of this cities biggest property owners.  I also know the owners on a somewhat personal level. One is partially retired, owns a couple planes, bought a brand new corvette a few months ago, has a house on the lake of the ozarks, one in Vegas and now 2 here. He built a new multi million dollar home just so he could be in the parade of homes. It is a really nice house, he’s even putting in a shooting range in his basement. To both owners credit, they’re both really nice people, they don’t walk around like they’re better than everybody else and are not afraid to get their hands dirty and work. "

"When I was about 7, I saw a story on the local news where a man was being arrested for rape. I asked my mom what rape was, and she told me ""It's when a man does something very bad to a woman."" 

Let's fast forward to Thanksgiving a few months down the road when my uncle was telling a story about his terrible, nosey, complaining neighbor.  Seven year old me blurts out in front of my whole family ""you should rape her!""

As you can imagine, that caused an awkward silence.  "
"Hopefully this might allay your fear a bit ... a girl can easily and cheaply experience a bigger dick by ordering a fake one from the internet.

If she's telling you she prefers average size, she's may just be talking from experience, even if she hasn't dated a huge dude.

She may have tried a bigger toy and decided it's not for her -  seriously it can take a lot of effort to make those things not hurt. Thickness-wise you need lots of lube and lots of time, and if it's too long it'll poke your cervix and that's also not fun. And that's when you're in complete control of the monster cock yourself. With another human on the end of it who's after their own pleasure and can't feel your sensations, you're much more likely to have a bad time.

So yeah, we're not lying."

Game of Thrones is still popular, but I'm going to do one last stock at the start of the last season, and then no more, probably doing a ""Show Finale"" sale at the end of the season.

"On the local level, you can start by calling/writing your representatives for the repeal of SESTA/FOSTA, which was a law recently enacted to fight human trafficking, but has done more harm than good. Legalizing sex work is important, because then sex workers will be able to be able to better screen their clients, and go to the police without fear of repercussions if their clients or pimps harm them. Many of these trafficked women and children are scared to go to the police because they will be arrested for prostitution/solicitation/etc. trafficking victims from other countries cannot contact the police because they will be immediately deported (and often times banned from the US because they’ve “committed a crime”) and the pimps in their home countries will see it as a “loss of merchandise” and can get violent with the victims and their families.

"I'm pretty short for a dude at 5'6"", and I've been shot down plenty of times by women who had no better reason than ""I like taller men, sorry."" I always figured it was dodging a bullet, if they're that shallow about it. Yeah, people have their preferences and that's cool, but to not even give someone a shot because they don't tick all the boxes on your chart exactly the way you want them to? That's like ordering the same meal at every restaurant you go to. You'd miss out on a ton. I'm short, hairy, and muscular(AND MY AXE). My wife had previously only ever dated tall, skinny, androgynous looking people, and I'm real glad she didn't decide I had to fit her exact mold. You'll find people out there who are into you, man.

"There's a distinct difference between masculinity and toxic masculinity. No one is saying it's not okay to be masculine, but what isn't cool is being so insecure about your masculinity that you judge and harass other men for expressing any kind of femininity or not conforming to a masculine ideal. If a man orders a ""girly"" drink at a bar, it's not unlikely that he'll be made fun of by other dudes. While if a woman orders a ""manly"" drink, her friends aren't likely to be like ""what are you not a real woman"". That's what toxic masculinity is. You shouldn't have to worry about how you're behaving unless you actually are toxic, in which case you should check yourself."

"But again, relationships are not one sided. If everything is great except for sex, then you should tell your partner that and see if there’s a way to move forward.  If they give approval, then both sides are getting what they want, and it’s a happy relationship.

If one side cheats so they are satisfied, and so they don’t lost the other person, especially if they know the other person would be hurt, then that’s 100% selfish, and I would question how much the cheater really loves them."

"If that’s your attitude, it’ll become a self fulfilling prophecy, that’s how I lost the woman I could see myself spending the rest of my life with.  You need to trust yourself, your girl, and learn to understand your qualities.  Your girl is a person that picked you for a reason, let her tell you what those reasons were, and fully believe that those reasons are why you are currently together.  Not acknowledging why you are together in the first place can send down a rabbit hole of depression, anxiety and resentment.  

Your next step then is to grow as a person, and deal with your shortcomings, if that’s your weight then it’s time to hit the gym, there is no factor more attractive than confidence, and confidence is built through hard work, discipline, ambition, all of which build you into a stronger person mentally and physically, a person that you will find it easier to believe in.  When you have self-belief and understand what you can control or influence in this world of ours, then there is nothing that can get you down.

Final point, opening up about your feelings with your loved one is a vital tool in helping your development, but relying on her help to show your emotions will put her off, finding the balance regarding accessing emotions is extremely hard for a lot of men out there, just take your time and and don’t let any failures define you.

I’m rooting for you."

"I have been a plumber for 22 years and it has been frustrating how hard it is to find young adults willing/capable of doing any manual labor. Using a shovel is comically foreign to them and they give up before learning how to do it correctly in a way that makes it far less straining. Gone are the days where 60% of your new hires bust their asses to prove themselves, it's down to about 15% now. Even the guys who clearly don't have much book smarts or that entrepreneurial drive to go do other stuff just shuffle around looking for ""easier"" jobs rather than buckling down. Trades jobs are in higher demand than they have been in like 20 years in the PNW so getting in isn't as tough as in leaner times. I am not one to say today's youngsters are lazy (they have a different kind of hustle in them than ""back in my day""), but the blue collar middle class is gonna be pretty different looking soon and not because of wages or greedy corporations."

A video (Sherlock is garbage and here's why) also made the rounds where a guy explains everything bad that happened with it that I feel boosted people's distaste for it a little more even after it was over and done with.

"As a tall skinny guy, one of my biggest sources of insecurity has to be the clothing rack.

&amp;#x200B;

It's painfully difficult to find casual clothing that fits well, especially pants. It's easy to get nice trousers, since they'll come unhemmed and I can get them made to fit, but things like jeans are difficult. The message I get is basically ""you're a statistical outlier, and any clothing we've got for you is a bit of an afterthought."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've noticed that brands that used to be good fits are changing their sizing schemes, and their clothing is now too large for me. I know I'm not losing weight, so it seems that even the relatively objective men's pants sizes are being re-interpreted. Someone gets to ""feel"" skinny, because they're suddenly buying 30-32 jeans, and meanwhile I need to find a new brand."
"My husband and I are the same height. I'm slightly tall for a woman; he's slightly short for a man. Neither of us has any hangups about this. 

We've been married 38 years!"
Women on those dating sites are quite often shallow. 
"You are very unusual among women, trust me. Almost every woman I’ve dated was taller, but your pool shrinks dramatically for every inch you are under 5’11” or so. I’ve tested this with online dating because I’m very proportional and people can rarely tell my height in pictures. Posted with my real height? No responses. Add 6”? Daily. No other change, exact same confidence. Straight women have huge hangups about height that just destroys our confidence."
"This is really sweet. Whenever I run into one of husband’s coworkers, they always tell me how much he talks about me. Always makes my day. "
"Holy fuck this reminds me about my schools band trip to Canada. One of the saxophone players is a jock football player who thinks he can get every girl. He and some of his friends went to play lazer tag on one of our free days. After the game he went up to the woman behind the counter, flirted with her, and asked for her number. She shut him down by saying she was lesbian. She then told one of his friends while he was right next to him, that she wasnt really lesbian, she just wanted to hurt his ego."
yes
"Oh, trust me they admit it. I've had 4 of my friends individually admit that height is the most important physical factor to them in a man. If you're under six foot, see ya!"
"I'm a guy that's had a lot of friends that are women, some close enough that ""girl talk"" has broken out around me a couple of times and they didn't think anything of it, so here are the things that I've noticed that men don't seem to want to believe when a woman says it to them:

1. Women's tastes are just as diverse as ours; when she says that she doesn't care about something about you that you don't like, trust that she's being honest.

2. When you're trying to impress women, they're pretty good at picking it out. Calm down, just talk to them about yourself like you would some random friend-of-friend.

3. When making a compliment about them in reference to something physical, go with something that was a conscious decision on their part. Shirt/earrings/shoes/bag/phone case/hairstyle/whatever. Noticing something that they took care in doing means a lot more than ""beautiful eyes"" or whatever other physical trait that they didn't have any part in deciding.

4. Penis size is what it is, stop being scared of it. I'm incredibly average in size and have never had a complaint, disappointed look, or even questionable result that couldn't be attributed to effort/exhaustion levels.

5. If you haven't noticed already, none of these replies have validated your insecurities, meaning that they're ultimately stupid and pointless. Go to therapy. We all need it.

Being emotionally exposed isn't as scary as your brain can make it out to be once you can take that leap.

"I’ve started to do this just to be a better sex partner, but having to is one of the things that has me considering whether I might be a little bit on the asexual side.

I sometimes become stressed out about providing my partners with a good experience and as a result generally enjoy it less than just masturbating. TMI? Sorry.

I just think it’s interesting that two people might be having sex and one might be thinking, “are they even enjoying this?” While the other is thinking, “god I hope they’re enjoying this.”

"I wouldn't feel bad about the DNR tattoo. Many doctors and medical professionals specifically will put them (DNR requests) in, because of the very real negative consequences. During CPR it's fairly common to break ribs. Liver damage isn't too uncommon. Success rates of even PERFORMING CPR CORRECTLY from a common bystander are around 1/2. (We're talking about using the right techniques, not actual chance of recovery) If you don't get it in the first 5-6 minutes, you're going to probably be permanently brain dead/severe mental issues. Even if you get it in the first 5-6 minutes, there's still a decent chance that you're going to have permanent problems. There's a 15% chance that CPR actually saves you.

* [Balamb Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eU0tRBHnE0)

* [Besaid Island Remastered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvK90o7GX3Y) is one of my favorite tracks in the series. The way the violin comes in @ 1:20 is perfect. The original is also a solid track.

* [To Zanarkand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-0G_FI61a8) is pretty iconic. 

* And talking about iconic songs in FF games, you can't exclude [One-Winged Angel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7h0JR1dZxo). 

* [A Fleeting Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eL7DUlUB_E) when you're walking through Zanarkand is something I'll never forget.

* [Blinded By Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfu0XBf8kmk) made fights in FF13 feel so hype inducing.

"There’s always room for someone to claim the victim of sexual harassment is being “overly sensitive.” I worked some place where a guy would literally grab and grope women in full view of other employees and managers at company parties. The consensus of other employees was that the predator was disgusting and wrong, but “that’s just how CJ is.” 

When some other women and I started to make a fuss, we were told we were the ones creating a problem (apparently there is no problem with sexual harassment or assault if the victims successfully fend off their attacker), that we were going to cost CJ his job, and we were responsible for whatever happened to his wife and daughter if he was fired. The guilt trip worked, and we didn’t go to the owners. 

Anyway, my point is that even if it looks super easy to confront someone or go public with harassment, there can easily be a hidden cost that witnesses don’t see or, if they do see, don’t think much of. "

The real Creed Bratton changed his name from William Charles Schneider. Implying that William Schneider killed the real Creed Bratton and stole his identity. BUT, he still uses the William Charles Schneider identity to transfer his debt to.

Furthermore, the real Creed Bratton has four toes on one foot, and speaks mandarin. Ok, you say, so they (the writers) decided to incorporate some funny elements of the real Creed Bratton. Except that the part was originally supposed to be a bit part with very little dialogue, and Creed himself actually created the Creed character.

I think the real Creed Bratton is insane and killed the other real Creed Bratton. "

"I like to hire escorts (I stay mainly in Southeast Asia) because I work from home, don't really want a relationship, and when I feel like having sex I don't want to go out and actually do the work to convince someone to do it with me. So, I'll often just call up an escort service and have a girl come over and fuck me for a couple of hours, have some drinks, chat, then I'll go back to doing my thing.   


Simple enough, right? No bullshit, no attachments...until this one girl.   


So I call the escort service pretty late one night - about 1 AM. I hear the knock on my door, and I open it and the girl is pretty (so far so good).   


We talk a little, have a drink.   


Then we get down to business. But for some reason this sex was better than ANY sex I've ever had in my life. I'm 32, I'm fit, I train, I have money, I travel - I've been with lots of girls (escorts or not). And I've been in a few long-term relationships and I thought I knew what ""passionate sex"" was.   


This was otherworldly. We fucked for at least four or five hours (the time was only supposed to be two hours). She ends up staying the night, then we fuck several more times when we wake up.   


In between we chat. Turns out her ex-husband was a US Marine, they went to China once and he wanted to have a threesome, so he calls up an escort service and she had so much fun and thought ""Oh! I could do that!"" So it was cool that it wasn't a story like ""I have a kid that I need to support"" or something. She just liked sex and money - fair enough.   


But when she left I couldn't stop thinking about her. I couldn't get any work done. I had her info so I messaged her and to my surprise she comes over that afternoon and we fuck for another couple of hours (no charge - in fact she didn't charge me again after that).   


But then things started getting out of control. I don't know how to properly explain this, but I have NEVER been more primally, chemically attracted to the point of destructive addiction as I was with this girl.   


When she wasn't around, I would jerk off thinking about her. I couldn't STOP having a boner all day whenever she crossed my mind. It was destroying me. I started to feel depressed the longer she was gone - I NEEDED her, wanted to taste her, touch her, smell her.   


It had nothing to do with her personality, had nothing really to do with her looks (she was great looking, but not like... drop-dead gorgeous fantasy good looking).   


It was something completely raw and chemical.   


Eventually I cut it off.   


She had me wrapped around her finger and she knew it. She had me begging for it. She had ALL the power - and I hated that feeling. Usually I'm the one who is aloof and can ""take it or leave it"" in any situation, but I was over my head.   


She started taking advantage of it, too. For example, she'd start having me meet her at specific times, if I said I couldn't do it then, she'd withdraw the offer, which means I would completely shift everything to fit her time.   


I could tell that this simply wasn't going to end good...that this girl could basically get me to do anything. So I just shut off all contact, left the country for a couple of months, and got drunk.   


Still think about it. I don't really understand why that happened. What was the reason i got so goddamned addicted and drunk off her? Out of all the girls I've seen, talked to, and been with around the globe over the years?"

edit: a word "
"From what I know from people who were awake while I was asleep when this happened, it doesn’t take more than two-three minutes tops between me starting to show signs of having a nightmare and waking up, and I can go to sleep afterwards, so I can’t really tell how it affects my sleep patterns. I do wake up from this particular experience drenched in sweat, as in I can literally squeeze liquid out of my T-shirt, and out of breath. 

I remember one time, years ago, when I was with my current boyfriend for only a short while - he is a very heavy sleeper and was not yet used to this - this went on for too long I suppose and I could feel sore muscles all over my body for a couple of days afterwards, so I imagine it’s nowhere near “having a good night’s rest” .

People with mental disabilities of one form or another have a hard time fitting into society because of it. It puts them at a disadvantage.

Providing a social safety net of mental health services helps these people by giving them treatment by mental health professionals. This in turn helps some better integrate with society, and thus have less need to turn to crime.

The ""fiscally responsible"" GOP loves axing programs like this and making life as harsh as possible for those the least equipped to deal with it. I don't know if it's because they truly feel that someone born with a mental disability is somehow less of a person not worthy of opportunity to exist, or they are so corrupt that they want to perpetuate the for-profit prison system by stripping crime-mitigating social programs out of the country.

One day I went over to my friends house. It was about a ten min walk. I remember eating hot steamy rice with pickled beef and eggs. I remember eating about 5 bowls of rice. 

It got late, past mid night and I knew I had to go home so I dont get the whipping ( with a thin branch). Opened the old school paper door( you can poke a hole in it with your fingers). I remember my heart dropping, if I translate to my language now I said ""shit"" in my mind. It was freakin dark.

I started walking and I swear I can hear foot steps and laughter behind me. Yes laughter. Someone laughing behind my back. I couldnt even turn around.  I still get the goosebumps as I write this. I started running in full speed towards home. I can still remember the laughter and my fake Adidas flip flops slapping the ground beneath me. It sounded like I was in a cave. scared out of my mind. I couldn't ask anyone since no one was there with me...sorry if it was boring but that's my 2 cents "

"I have two stories from different places:

**1. Rude customer:** Wanted a half sheet birthday cake for her son last minute (aka in an hour). We didn't have any sheet cakes available that were to room temp so we would have to get one out of the freezer. Told the lady the cake would not be able to be thawed and decorated in time in an hour. If we put icing on a frozen cake, the icing would crack causing the cake to look terrible. Lady said she didn't care. She needed the cake NOW!! 

We get out a frozen half sheet and decorate. The lady doesn't come by for the cake hours later... and then gets angry that the icing is cracked on the cake. She goes to the store manager and files a complaint. She gets the cake for free plus another free cane whenever she wants. Store manager cusses us out. When we explain he doesn't give two shots, despite our 24 he cake order policy. When the lady came by to order another cake a while lady, the look on her face made me want to spit in her cake. I didn't though...

**2. Rude customer:** I had came in right before the store closed (I should have taken that as a fucking sign right then and there). She told me she had an easy return (okay...). Turned out she wanted to return a product we sold more than a year ago that was used up. It was a little weird but our store had the policy that ""if you don't love it, we will accept any return"", so I began the return process. She didn't have her receipt (this is key right here). Anyway, the system priced her item at only a few dollars because the product was so old. Lady was a bit peeved at that but went on with the return. When it came to the refund, we could only offer store credit because she did not have her original receipt. This is when the bitch went psycho.

Why may I ask? She wanted to be refunded on her Walmart credit card specifically. ""Why can't you do this? This store is fucking terrible, you're such a bitch, blah blah blah"". At this point it is well past closing time. My manager comes over and tried talking to her. Lady was not listening one bit. She refused to leave until we refunded her on the goddamn Walmart credit card. We ended up having to call security to get her out of the store. At this point, it was almost 45 mins after closing time. She must have thought she could try to pay down her credit card bill with that return or something. The look on her kid's face as security was escorting her off the premises was fantastic though. Man, she was a nutter."

"Sorry to hear you and your dad went through it too.

To partially answer your question; he was furious when he found out - less than a year ago. My dad was preparing to sue -- I told him I wouldn't testify or see my rapist again, under any circumstances. I finally gave the police tips and told some people in positions of authority what happened to me. I say rape but there was more stuff. It was really, really bad, and it would destroy me to have to go back to that period in my life.

My dad and I were both boarding school kids. He never had a problem and loved it. His abuse happened in summers and on breaks by the priest at his family's church, so of course he loved boarding. He never wanted to leave school.  I went from age 9+ and loved it until the middle school years, when the abuse started happening. Eventually I transferred to a different school in high school, convinced my parents I wanted to transfer for academic reasons. 

At that point I was used to boarding and I blamed my almost as much for what happened to me, for being so negligent, that I just wanted to move schools rather than move home. Of course I later learned that my dad, because of his experiences at home growing up, probably thought I was in the safest place I could be. So it helps me understand his neglect, if not excuse it. My mom ... I still have a very bitter time about her. Ironically, my mom has been raped as well in high school by a boyfriend. This she told me voluntarily, when I got older, before she ever even knew about my abuse. But instead of bringing us together it made me more bitter - all this time, she should have known the signs if she had been through it herself, I couldn't think or speak up, she should have spoken for me.


My dad and his family are a big can of worms for me. 

They are wealthy immigrants; my mom and I are estranged from them. My parents had a years long and brutal divorce. I was their pawn. My dad hardly endeared himself to me in this time because it felt like he only thought about destroying my mom at all costs, damn the consequences. He didn't even think about how it would hurt me. My mom made a lot bad choices, put a lot of stress on me I shouldn't have been involved with, but at least I felt she loved me. I grew up without seeing my dad for years at a time, though he was distantly involved in executive decisions (ie if I could transfer to a different boarding school). 

Despite this and having no influence from them the similarities between myself, my father, and his family are so undeniable it's almost eerie. I look nothing like my mom. I've always felt like an outsider in her family. Despite the fact that my dad's family rejected my mom I've always secretly felt that I'd fit in better there. We look the same. We think the same. We have the same calculating personalities. 

I love my mom but it's always been a nurture thing with her, not nature, a labor of love. We're so different and the gulf widens as I get older. She's just so emotional. Sometimes I look back and secretly find myself taking my dad's side, or wishing he'd taken custody of me instead, because at least I would have grown up financially secure and stable. My mom and I were always moving. 
(I was only able to attend boarding school as a gifted student.)

It's more heartbreaking with his mother. He has the relationship with his mother that I have with him. It's not exactly the same but it's similar. She's just such a formidable woman. She came from an era where women couldn't do anything in her country and deeply resented this, understandably, and takes it out on her husband and sons. She was abused by her own father; I'm not sure if it was sexual in nature but I wouldn't be surprised. 

My dad, my gma, and probably her dad all have the same personality disorder. It's heartbreaking to me. It ties me to my family in a way that is so visceral. I'm the only one who has been diagnosed but I know they have it because I was exhaustively genetically tested and know that it comes from them. And it makes me angry, because I want to be angry at my dad and gma, but knowing the abuse and the disease, I can't. And that makes me angry, because I want to hold  
them accountable. For failing me as a dad and as a grandmother. But I cant. I know what I'm like with kids, what people with my disorder are like. We cant connect with people below our intellectual capacity. Most people's primary 'gateway' is emotion, so they are able to connect with children, ours is the mind. We are not able to connect with the mind of a child, who cannot stimulate us. But as an adult... Talking to my dad feels like the prodigal daughter or something. We're just so much alike and so in sync, I can't even. It rips my heart out. 

I thought that maybe if I could seek treatment for my disorder, and come out about my abuse than my dad could come out of the shadows and maybe heal. Together. I feel like he wants to, but he feels like he can't because he's a guy, he's a successful businessman, he's upper middle age. It's not ok for him to be seen as a victim. It's ok for me because I was all the right things to be if you're going to be a rape victim; young girl being abused in the place that was supposed to take care of her. My case just inspires outrage while I think he thinks people would just pity him or view him as damaged, or less of a man.

What really is sad is that my dad probably IS gay. He's never confirmed this but I'm like 80% positive that he's at least bi.  My mom overshared and told me they hardly ever had sex - he seemed to want a daughter more than he wanted sex. She told me that she was his second choice; his longtime gf before her committed suicide. From what my dad has told me about her, he wasn't in love with her either, but he cared deeply about her - she came from a background of abuse too, and one day she just couldn't take the depression anymore. I think they were just best friends, and they coped together. When she died dad lost the only person who could understand him. I think Dad is gay but just wanted to try and be normal and have a family, and married my mom when it didn't work out with his ex gf, but that inevitably didn't work out either, because he couldn't make himself love my mom.

It would make me so happy to see him happy in a relationship with man who loves him but even if I hope that will happen I doubt it ever will. I think what happened to him hurt him so deeply the thought of being with another man is unfathomable. Not to mention what people would think. 

To try and encourage him I've even told him that I've been with other women and men both. I don't know if it helps him to know that I for one wouldn't judge him.

As to if he supports me; it's hard when he won't admit what happened to him. He doesn't even know that I know. He definitely does support me but it's more of in the way of a parent who doesn't know what their kid has gone through - are you ok, etc. Except there's more to it than that. He clearly does know what I've gone through and there's a dynamic boiling below the surface of how he interacts with me if he's ever comforting me, if I ever decide I want to talk about things. Like he's on the cusp of opening up but can't bring himself to speak the words. I actually wonder if he's ever told anyone that he wasn't forced to tell; when his parents found out about his abuse, it was because another child told their parents what was happening to them. 
From what I understand, Dad confirmed what was going on, the priest was taken to prison, and dad had to testify, but never went to therapy or anything. It wasn't as common back then and they lived in a small town, and they didn't have that at his school - counselling at his school at the time (if needed) would be handled by the school's priest or a professor. No one was going to make my dad talk to a priest after everything, and no one was going to come home and be with his family when his school was the only place he felt safe.

I also think my dad feels immeasurably guilty about what happened to me, and that he has fundamentally failed me in every way that matters as a father. It's ironic because before he knew what happened to me, he didn't seem to care, and thought his duties extended to a child support check. But he seems to think he failed if I was abused like he was - like, if she just struggles a bit, not my problem. But being abused like I was... anything but that.

I can tell they're trying to be flirtatious so I just do my best to have a normal convo, since I don't expect to see them again.

"Not how it works though, since the top of that triangle will be at the joint between the legs, your torso and head are still straight but either way would not effect the height of your dick from the ground.

The proper math would be x-0.133x where x is the distance between the floor and your dick, and not your total height.

But do take into consideration that the first few degrees of spreading your legs doesn't do much to your overall height given that it works on a cosine curve, the more you angle your legs from this point on the lower you get per degree.

As an example, you only drop 13.3 percent from 0 to 60. But you drop 30 percent by adding another 30 degrees to a 90 degree angle with your legs.

This post is retarded but let's finish it up anyways. Since I know the proper values for the human anatomy, let's say the penis is 0.45 up the total height of the human. Using the same 180cm figure as the previous post, you get a 81cm dick height (these values are rounded) and 70cm dick height at 60 degree spread, and a whopping 56.7cm dick height at a 90 degree spread. Imitating a 155.55cm and 126cm body respectively.

Now that I've done the math, I hope you don't have to spread to 90 degrees or you should probably be arrested. (unless of course you have a very short but legal gf) "

"I accidentally disintegrated the DM's and the entire party's favorite NPC, (he was my favorite too...)

Hobgoblin-bro (Grackle-snarell) was recruited by our 'iron fist' city ruler samurai, who slaughtered thousands of goblins as revenge for the death of 5 NPC adventurers our group had hired to explore the area.

Grackle-snarell was introduced with the survivors of this massacre being interrogated, and he spit in our samurai's face... Thus he was the only NPC with a spine. He immediately endeared himself to us by saying he killed the adventurers. quote, ""Those weaklings were pissing me off walking around like they owned the place, so I killed them all and took their shiny stuff"" We are not a 'good' party.

We were forced into a conflict shortly after with a vampire overlord (we were 5 players around level 11 who were slightly OP), the hobgoblin stole our hearts by successfully grappling the vampire overlord for 2-3 turns while the others wailed on it until it died (I died too :/ )

Grackle-snarell was cemented as a long term character after that, he had his own character sheet, and was built by the DM to be a truly impressive figure of min-maxing. But he still only level 8.

fast forward 2 sessions and we have our ship raided by pirates, while the ship's captain is completely unconscious, and being cut into like a fresh slice of ham. Grackle-snarell is supposedly knocked-out too. 

Last round of combat, all that's left is the enemy attacking the ship's captain. I run forward, round the corner, and blast an enemy with the Disintegrate spell...

But that enemy was actively being torn in half by Grackle-snarell. Grackle-snarell failed the DC 19 dex check, and took a total of 81 damage. He had 63 hp.

He was instantly reduced to ash, and cannot be revived by anything our characters have access to...

Our DM tore the poor hobgoblin's character sheet in half, and the rest of the group doesn't look at me the same. Our DM is also my roommate... He is still not acting the same around me and my character.

We held a memorial service in-game, as a final testament to his spirit. My character still carries his ashes in a necklace, as a reminder, only use powerful spells when they are absolutely needed, and when you know you absolutely want to kill something.

"In my experiences, that narcissism and disregard for others is pretty common amongst junkies. I’m specifically talking about junkies; addicts recognize the problem and even if they aren’t actively trying or have tried and failed, they know that they have a problem and feel not-good about it. 

It makes sense anyway. Recovery groups are all about connecting with others, holding each other accountable and listening. You know who tend to be bad at these things? Narcissists. That’s a big reason why junkies give into addiction. It’s easier to get a fix than it is to connect with others, especially about such a difficult topic. Plus, junkies prioritize feeling good over themselves and loved ones with little to no guilt.

I’ve lived the life of an addict and a junkie, and I’ve loved both as well. It certainly takes an emotionally strong person to be on the other end of it, but the strongest aren’t the ones who tolerate the abuse. They’re the ones who know when to say enough is enough, give an ultimatum and act on it if necessary. These are often abusive relationships, and it’s easy to get sucked in. "

Oh boy. There is one actor in PH that he is fantastic and cracks me up. If your interested I will try and find it.
"Let's talk **SQUIRTING**.

I'm going off on a tangent but I still want to share all this. First are a few problems I've had because of squirting. The big wall of text at the end describes what you might feel like if our roles were reversed (when someone is trying to make me squirt).

Those who have never squirted do have one up side. After I squirted for the first time years ago my boyfriend started obsessing over trying to make me cum like that again. Some girls can say ""no, I don't squirt"" and that's that. My SO **knows** it's in the cards so he won't back down gently. Don't get me wrong, it feels fan-fucking-tastic when it happens and I appreciate that he tries, but there are a few issues. 

**-1-** is that it's just something that's not going to happen all of the time, an uncommon occurrence. Both my body and mindset have to be in some weird sync for it to happen, not to mention the required stimulation. It can't just be turned on/off solely by making the right moves or stroking the g spot. 

**-2-** is that when he's trying to get me there and it's just not happening, he usually throws good technique out the window out of desperation. It does **not** feel good to have my g spot (or anything for that matter) jackhammered with a finger.  The g spot is a *very* sensitive area and needs a gentle touch when it comes to direct stimulation (fingers/toys). Like the advice given by other ladies, I WILL tell you if i want you to go harder or faster - first with my body, and then my words if he's not getting it. When he goes too hard too fast it hurts, subsequently drying me out and making me sore (sometimes badly enough that I can no longer orgasm at all).

***--3--*** is the BIGGEST PROBLEM by far IMO: *the pressure*. Honestly, your approach shouldn't be different from normal other than keeping g-spot stimulation in mind once I'm extremely aroused. You should simply act like you just want to make me feel good, with squirting just being a possible outcome - because that's all it is. Don't set out with the sole purpose of trying to make me squirt. It's okay to try, but if it's just not happening, *let it go* for the love of all that is good and holy. It's just going to go downhill if you try to force it, so learn to let it go and be satisfied with a 'regular' orgasm. There's nothing worse than hearing ""come on, squirt for me baby"" over and over again when it's just not happening. I always end up feeling like a failure for not getting there and the increasing pressure to 'perform' just stresses me out to the point of getting turned off sometimes. I'm just here to have both of us feel good, and it's never fun feeling like a regular orgasm is a sad consolation prize that you don't want to happen.


**So, let's put you in my shoes now. Imagine this: ** You're fooling around with a lady trading hand jobs and you just can't get very hard for some reason (can't get past a semi).  It's just not happening no matter what you try and no matter how good you feel. You'd still able to cum just fine, it's just that you can't get any harder. Lady friend is repeatedly telling you ""come on, get hard already baby, come on, it's so *sexy* when you get rock hard for me"", even though it's clearly not in the cards tonight, so you tell her as much: you're feeling amazing but you don't think it's going to get any harder; let's keep doing exactly what we're doing. She seems to take that as a challenge- she knows you can get harder than this since she's seen it before. She thinks that if she works hard enough she'll get what she wants out of you, despite you warning her otherwise. She starts going really rough and fast on lil softy with her hands, working it with an iron grip that is painful in your current state. Her intentions are good, but the obsession over whether or not she can get you harder has blinded her to your actual needs and what feels good.  You're content with it being a little soft as long as you're both satisfied to completion. She keeps focusing on its softness though and soon you start to feel insecure about it, like you've failed for not being able to get harder, despite being able to pleasure her just fine. And finally, after your member has been abused for a while you grow even softer from all the pressure to perform. You wonder why she can't be okay with you the way you are and why she's not satisfied unless you get harder (I.E. do ""better""). Why does it matter so much to her? :( Now you're questioning whether you'll even be able to cum anymore, despite how amazing you felt earlier before she brought up how soft you were and started mistreating your member. 

IDK why I felt the need to make that long-winded post and analogy. My boyfriend stopped putting so much pressure on me after I brought it up multiple times, but I never got the impression he really understood what bothered me about it. **I'll be ecstatic if this can help even one person understand how it feels during sex to have all that pressure and how it can ruin the moment. Enjoy each other and make everyone feel good. That's the important part.. &lt;3**

Sometimes people have certain topics that they aren't comfortable talking about. Sometimes people have went through some trauma and have a hard time trusting people because of it.

On top of everything, humans can be quite illogical when emotions are involved."

"I usually just tell them it's my treat without any given reason.

I think I've pretty much always paid for the dates. There's a lot of reasons for it though. I know, even a lot of modern feminist girls, will pay for half of the date but they won't go on a second date with you. I think I may have only ever gone on a date with one girl who makes even close to what I make (even people who make as much as me usually can't spend the way I do just because I never racked up debt I'm paying back). And mostly, I just don't really mind.

Also to some degree I pay for things as a way to measure the girl. To see if they'll try and pay by the 3rd date, or if they'll start trying to get me to take them to fancier and fancier places that they can't afford. I don't mind paying, but at the same time I don't like feeling like I'm being used for my money. So I'm interested to see what people do when they don't have to spend their money."

"The most important thing I’ve learned is that money isn’t a resource to be spent, it’s a tool to be leveraged to earn more money. That’s a common way of thinking among rich people who have maintained wealth over the long term, but not among poor people or the newly rich. By that I mean even personal expenditures are evaluated based on their potential return (i.e. a fancy car depreciates quickly, whereas a nice house will usually gain value over time). Even just $5M managed wisely can set up a family for generations. 

Rich people who have been rich for a while don’t work for their money, their money works for them. "

"God people like that piss me off. I can understand if you can't afford to take time off work or your boss is an asshole about taking sick days. But if someone can take it off, and still comes in? That person is a selfish prick. Especially when I see people come in sick, blowing their nose at their desk, and then touching a bunch of other shit in the office. Like really? You can't even make an effort to be considerate? 

In some ways it's like stealing other people's sick time/PTO because they don't want to give it up, then bring it to work and make other people sick who WILL stay home. Plus, what if you get someone sick before something important they have in their life, like a vacation, family reunion, etc. And then there are people who have medical problems which can be made worse by being sick. My asthma was made worse for a couple of years because I got bronchitis. Woke up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe, had to go to the doctors and shit. Was terrified to sleep for awhile. And I've known other people with medical problems that are made way worse by being sick. But most people don't think about that stuff. Sorry for the rant, this stuff just really pisses me off.

TL;DR if you have the ability to stay home sick, PLEASE don't be selfish and say home!! You have no idea what problems you're causing other people!!"

"I suspect that resource scarcity is not a planetary thing, but a structural one.

Any organism will naturally grow to consume all available resources.  Combine that with humans' penchant for social grouping, and at least local resource scarcity would seem to be an inevitability.

That's to say, if we had more stuff, we would've already evolved to consume more stuff.  I think we tend to evolve towards an equilibrium, on a longer-term scale."
My first day of high school ever I sit on the bus and this guy asked me to prom and asked me each year after wards.I politely declined each year. 3years  after he graduated he got arrested for child pornography.
"Dude I have a friend who does the exact opposite. I witnessed she and her boyfriend get into a fight that led to them breaking up and was pleasantly surprised at how she handled it all. First thing she did was call her boyfriend and ask if she could reply to this chick that was essentially tormenting her on social media because she knew that he was good friends with this girl. After they got into a fight she constantly kept saying ""I just want you to defend me, you are my boyfriend and she is tormenting me."" She constantly said what was bothering her and what she was upset about. It was honestly refreshing to see someone doing that because every other girlfriend my friends have had would just sulk for 3 days and it would get worse. "

A few days later I saw another one of her posts about gender equality. Another woman took a screenshot of her post ranting about guys not doing all the work and posted it in the comments, then asked her what is it that she wanted, gender equality or if she was waiting for a guy to do everything for her.   

That post was taken down shortly after.

"Idk man crickets have been known to cannibalize on eachother the moment they become even slightly hungry. I have a lizard and sometimes I buy crickets to feed him. One day I bought a bag of ten well fed crickets and by that night they had all already ganged up on one of their own and were eating its now decapitated corpse. Oh and armored crickets can spray their own noxious smelling blood out in all directions at will to ward off predators. The smell of their blood also happens to be appetizing to their own though so... yeah if other crickets are around cannibalism is soon to follow.

Couldn't manage to swallow the large one due to its size. Couldn't get it back out either cuz it was continuously beeing pulled into my throat by the first piece of meat wich was halfway down.

I was feeling like was about ready to pass out when i finally managed to vomit everything out with one final big push.

"Well, that may be partially true, but there were definitely some moments of significant growth for Dwight. One of the most powerful for me was, when, in the episode in which he finds out that he's finally getting promoted to manager, he thinks Jim's going to get the job. He says, ""I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager."" Contrast that to the first time Jim gets promoted and Dwight gets passed over (his first reaction is a blood-curtling scream."" He also acknowledges that the only reason (he thinks) he's not getting the job is that he ""made too many mistakes,"" a rare moment of humility. The Dwight of the first few seasons, who thought he was better than all his coworkers and hated Jim, would never have said that. 

In general, by the end of the show, he has much more respect for his coworkers and develops from a sycophant hell-bent on climbing the corporate ladder into a true leader.

Also look at the way he backs off of Angela when she turns down his marriage proposal, telling her he understands and respects her decision to stand by the state senator. Remember when she was planning to marry Andy, and in addition to literally trying to fight Andy for Angela, he tricked Angela into marrying him?

Yes, he doesn't totally overcome his flaws, but who EVER overcomes their flaws 100%? What I admire about his transformation in the Office is that it unfolds slowly and subtly. You learn more about Dwight's character over the season, as you say, but you also see him change in some fundamental ways. Not all ways, mind you, but enough that you can see a pronounced difference between beginning-of-the-show and end-of-the-show Dwight. The changes are substantial enough to redeem him, I think.

Plus, Dwight would be no fun if he completely overcame all of his flaws."

My party was investigating a demon cult that turned out to be summoning demons and devouring them to gain power, which the found out when a wounded succubi asked for their help in one of the antechambers leading to the complex.

She tasked them with capturing or killing the head summoner of the cult, so after a bunch of shenanigans, they polymorphed him into a guinea pig and threw him in a bag of holding, plopped him down in front of her, to which she just stared at the party like they were idiots.

Of course after the spell wore off she was pretty happy, but the party was really having a moral quandary of ""We're helping demons kill Humans, but the humans are the bad guys, but we're helping demons....""

"This. Right. Here. 

Holy fuck the number of people ive played with whos character was basically ""myself with superpowers but I take no shit from anyone ever"" and argued about every negative outcome and attacked people for literally looking at them wrong."
"See, that doesn’t make sense to me for a few reasons.

First, it presents a logistical problem. If you have anything as part of your character’s backstory, other players aren’t supposed to metagame using that knowledge. It can ruin the game and the party dynamic for someone to play as though their character had that knowledge. Also, it flies in the face of most alignments and would be unrealistic for most characters. So it’s just bad playing without players agreeing to the scenario.

More than that, one player has chosen to roleplay sexual violence against a player’s character without them agreeing to it. It’s one thing to rape an NPC, which is still messed up, but almost no one is going to be comfortable having you talk to them about how you’d rape their character. Even if you can justify it in the story, making your own party uncomfortable just because you can tends to end campaigns or groups poorly.

End all, you absolutely don’t open the door to having another player decide to play rapist because you included trauma in your character’s backstory.

"This is the plight of the horror movie enthusiast.  We have to wade through shitty horror film after shitty horror film until we become numb to how a horror movie is rightly supposed to make you feel - then whenever we finally find a good one it's both exhilarating and completely terrifying at the same time to the point where you start to ask yourself why you liked horror films in the first place.

That’s when I started walking back to the tills and I noticed him talking to a mother with her child that was around 3 months old in a pushchair. He literally asked the same questions to the woman as he did me, then all of a sudden without warning he bent down and just started tickling the babies feet! 

My and my co-worker couldn’t believe what had just happened and were dumbfounded by it all, the mother then abruptly left our store. 

We both then turned round to see where the baby tickler was and he was just leaving the store following yet another toddler trying to tickle them as well!

"Have you ever had an incredibly self-centred roommate who acted like they owned the entire apartment and like they could do no wrong, but everything you did was egregiously annoying? Well, my parents were like that asshole roommate except they DID own the place, being the parents, so from their perspective I had no right to complain about a single thing they did, ever, and if I didn’t like it I could move out, so I did.


I don’t understand it, personally - yeah, you as the parent work 35 whole hours per week to pay 100% of the bills and your life is so hard, it’s a real struggle etc etc, but it’s literally impossible for your kids to work because they’re children. How can you hold home ownership over their heads as a reason to disrespect them, when at their age they have no choice but to live with you? IMO you should treat everyone in your home with a minimum level of respect. 

But my parents acted exactly like that shitty roommate that everyone’s had at some point...


They make as much noise as they want, whenever they want, but if you dare to even cautiously open the door past 10pm you get screamed at. 


You aren’t allowed to have friends over because even a quiet conversation behind closed doors is too noisy and disturbing for them, but they’ll invite their friends with a SCREAMING BABY over at midnight on a weeknight.


They take up all the fridge, counter, and storage space in the entire house but they scream at you if you dare move THEIR coffee machine 3” to the left so that you have enough room to butter a slice of bread because how dare you disturb other people’s possessions?! (Our kitchen was REALLY cluttered, my mom has an appliance hoarding problem. You don’t need 3 coffee makers!!!!)


(I didn’t even have a closet to hang my clothes in because my mom used the closet in my room for storage LOL. My clothing was in piles on the floor.)



They take over the bathroom for 2 hours every morning doing their hair and makeup but they start banging on the door and shouting if you shower for more than 3.5 minutes. 


They leave dirty dishes and garbage all over the house but if you DARE drink a glass of water in your room you get screamed at.


They leave their wet laundry in the washing machine for 8 days at a time, so you have to wear dirty clothes to school and get mocked by the other kids, because if you DARE touch THEIR clothing, even to just temporarily move it out of the washing machine, you get yelled at.


I could go on... ironically none of my siblings give a shit about this treatment and all of them still live at home. It’s incomprehensible to me. Maybe I’m just the least favourite :/ "

"I think so. Sorry I didn’t type it too clearly before. Rough night and been kind of frazzled. The entire time I was there they spent raping and torturing me, doing anything they could to inflict as much pain as possible because they were getting off on it. I probably shouldn’t go into more detail than that here just for the sake of people reading and I’m so sorry if any of this is too much for anyone. But toward the end I was really bad off and I’d lost a lot of blood and if they’d kept me there they knew I was going to die. So they had a conversation in front of me about whether or not they were just going to bury me in the backyard at that point or take me to a hospital. They figured that I’d die either way but that if I was in a hospital I’d last a little longer and be in pain until I died which is what they decided they wanted. I know it was pretty naive of me but I didn’t realize back then that people could be so evil. They took such pleasure in hurting me, and laughed about it and made fun of me for crying and screaming and begging for them to stop. They told me they didn’t want their fun to end just yet and that’s why they decided to take me to the ER. I hope that helps clarify, if not I can try again. Just kinda tired so trying to put together coherent thoughts 😊"

He eventually got a response from a guy who wanted to trade a “gently used” coffin, with “slight stains from decomposition”. The guy even sweetened the deal with various jars of embalmed organs. My dad was pretty freaked out. 

Turns out my uncle heard about my dad’s new hobby and wanted to fuck with him, so he called up an old friend of the family and made up the entire coffin thing.  "

This Ad campaign means some really smart people put a lot of work into deciphering the likely political and consumer preferences of the future.

I had the fortune of watching that episode live with some friends back when it aired. We had all been on the same zip lining trip with like a church youth group back in middle school. It was an excellent portrayal of our experience and we laughed our asses off commiserating with their struggle 
"Double standards are real. I wish it was socially acceptable for me as a women to *not* have to shave my legs as I absolutely loathe doing it and don’t personally mind the fuzz, but society says I’m weird.

We see the menu and there's a strawberry milkshake, creamy, fluffy, sparkly unicorn jizz of a cocktail that came with umbrellas AND sparklers and was exactly what I needed after a hot day and it didn't have much alcohol cos I wasn't feeling like it. 
My girlfriend however ordered ""snakebite, death mega nuke"" or some nasty shit, it had whisky, tequila, vodka, hobo earwax ect. I remember being shocked because she isn't a big fan of alcohol but she was on holiday and it sounded ""nice"".

Anyway as always they put the girly drink in front of my gf and the manly horrible stuff in front of me, we smile and when they left we switch. I take one sip and it blows my tits off, it's like drinking straight from a vodka bottle or paint thinners so I say ""wow if mine is strong yours must be awful"" she's loving it but says it tastes like fruit juice. After a bit a waiter comes by, runs over to the table and in broken english is gesturing at the drinks and says ""this for you? sorry sorry, we though you wanted...erm this one fruit punch we make mistake, I sort"" and he ran off with both drinks.

In case y'all dont know, a 2014 compilation of studies of 15,521 men found that the average erect penis size is 5.16 inches long (13.12 cm). And the average penis circumference (aka “girth”) is 4.59 inches (9.31 cm).  

-Nearly 90% of guys have a penis between 4-6 inches.
-1% of men have a penis between 7-8 inches
-0.7% have a 9-inch penis
-0.1% of guys have a penis larger than 9 inches

Women will VERY likely feel your girth more than your length.

Something almost no men understand is our vaginas do not have the same sensitivity as your penis. Want to know what it feels like?
Push your tongue against your cheek, or your finger. Do you notice that the inside of your cheek experiences pressure but isn't sensitive to your actual touch? That. That is what it feels like. The most sensitive part is the opening and your girth affects that.

On that point, the SHAPE of your dick and the position you're in determined if you hit any of our sensitive, pleasurable areas. You can't change your dick (without surgery), but you can change your position. Fingers are usually better, anyways.

And if the girl likes the feeling of being ""filled up"", put her in a position that shortens her vagina...  on her back with her legs pushed back, or on her side with her knees to her chest.

And for the love of God, please understand that slamming your dick into us and bottoming out HURTS LIKE HELL. We'd rather you not. It's much better to be smaller than to be too big.

"I’ve never been particularly comfortable walking at night but I used to do it heaps. I don’t drive so sometimes there’s no choice.

So a few years ago I walked down the road just as evening turned to night. I could make out a shadowy figure up ahead but didn’t think much of it. It was early and not uncommon to see people out and about.

But something about the figures body language creeped me out. I quickened my pace and told myself I was being paranoid. 

As I got closer he pulled some sort of mask onto his face. A weird skull mask thing. He then raised his arms outright like he was threatening to strangle me. It was the creepiest damn thing I’ve ever seen. Then he slowly came towards me. Everything about it was threatening. 

I absolutely screamed my head off. Then like a cliche from b grade horror movie I tripped and landed hard in both hands. He seemed to be walking so slowly yet it felt like no matter how fast I ran he was still only a few paces behind me. Finally I got to a block of units and fortunately a young couple were leaving just as I approached. 

I briefly (and very incoherently) told them what happened and we sort of hovered at the entrance as he came into view. It was clear he had no interest in attacking me now that I was with other people. Either that or the whole point was just to scare the living shit out of me.

He cackled with laughter and yelled “it’s okay love!” and then gave this weird howl.

I got lucky, I think. It could have been way worse. But I never walk alone at night anymore. 

Tl;dr Walked alone at night. Creepy dude came towards me, wearing a hoodie and a creepy skull mask. I ran away and found help. Coulda been worse but still shut scary."

"Ex nightwalker here. I suffer from anxiety now so can't deal with it. I used to be nocturnal when I was in my later teens. I remember on the night before my 18th birthday I went for a walk (ended up staying out after midnight, so technically I left the house as a 17 yr old and returned a 18yr old). Anyway, at one point I just sat on a bench on a main road for a break, probably had a smoke. It was probably about 4 am. This guy, he looked late 40s, pulled up in his car and said 'get in the car'. He was fairly aggressive in his approach. I said no, then he asked again but this time I ramped up my tone, NO! He got the message and moved on. Admittedly it freaked me out but also I find it concerning, I wonder how many people get abused this way"
"A YouTuber who is MtF trans talked about arousal in both states. When in a mans body, arousal came from visual stimuli, but after the transition, arousal came from situations.

"I woke up one morning to find my car was gone. To make matters worse I had got some pretty expensive equipment in there that belonged to my employer, equipment that I was explicitly told to keep secure and not leave in my car all night. I felt horrible, not only was my car gone but I would be lucky to keep my job too.

I was just about to call work and the police to report it stolen when it dawned on me that I had stopped off at the village shop to buy milk on my way home the previous evening and then absent mindedly walked home on autopilot because I never drive to the shop. I have never felt so relieved.

"It's alright but there is some pretty legitimate complaints.

* Leveling to max doesn't give new talents or abilities. While Zones also scale with your level. Makes the experience unrewarding. I feel weaker at 120 than I did at 110.

* Story progression is locked behind reputation. Which isn't necessarily an issue. But with the only reputation source being world quests it gets pretty slow. Feel unnecessarily dragged out and as others have said creates pacing issues.

* The new artifact item suffers from the same reputation gate. Artifact Power gains are also low. I assume this is to balance I out for people with less time to play. However, it feels way to slow even as a casual player.


* Azerite gear is doodoo. It's the replacement of legion legendaries and tier gear. It's just bleh. Traits are locked behind artifact level, which as mentioned is slow. So it again feels like ""fake progression"" to make the game last longer.


However I will say world PvP is great right now if you like it."

"There is a famous quote which comes *from* an arab oil bazillioniarre which says the same thing (copy pasted from Wikipedia)


Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum was responsible for the transformation of Dubai from a small cluster of settlements near the Dubai Creek to a modern port city and commercial hub.[4] His famous line, ""My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will ride a camel"",[5] reflected his concern that Dubai's oil, which was discovered in 1966 and which began production in 1969, would run out within a few generations. He therefore worked to develop the economy of Dubai so that it could survive after the end of oil production, and was a driving force behind a number of major infrastructure projects to promote Dubai as a regional hub for trade

"Cluster headache. 

Let me put it in perspective for you, based on other things I have experienced. 

A broken tooth I'd put at ~5. 

A broken foot &amp; the accompanying surgery was a 6. 

A migraine is a 7. 

My appendix rupturing &amp; festering for 2 day, followed by surgery was a 9. 

Cluster headache is an 11. Literally, and I mean the actual definition of literally, the only reason I'm alive is because I'm in too much pain during one to kill myself. 

Imagine the worst pain you've ever felt. The kind that makes you puke, leaves you delirious, and pissing yourself. Now imagine that pain focused in one spot in your head. Imagine it lasting for 2 hours, and there's no relief for it, not even passing out. 

If I had to choose between removing the plate in my foot with a dull, rusty screwdriver or having another cluster headache, I'd tell you to pass me the screwdriver without a moment's thought. "

We were only standing there because the Registry listed us for an appearance and didn't bother checking with the Judge. We shouldn't have even been there, but when the court tells you to show up, *you show up*.

They didn't know what was going on either - so they just started arguing an appeal out of nowhere. No application made, no submissions, no disclosure beforehand. And the Judge entertained it. So I was flying by the seat of my pants - doing urgent legal research right there at the bar table on my iPad while they were arguing. (I don't think electronics were actually allowed at the bar table back then, but the Judge didn't seem to mind.)

We won, thankfully. So then we ended up with not one, but two costs orders against them.

"&gt;I can't believe nobody has said this, but it has always been a conversation with any of my SO's. Being emotional. A lot of girls seem to think that ""being one of the guys"" is the way to go.

As a woman who's always been ""one of the guys"" (no, seriously, a number of people I know have told me I act like a man, or that I want to be a man - thanks, Dad), I've come to the conclusion that guys...really don't like that out of women.

I mean, my friends are fine with me and that's cool.  Not looking to date them anyway, but when I was dating, guys were rather uncomfortable with me because maybe they thought I was being phony or fake to get them to like me better or something.  And believe me, I get that.  I'm sure they've encountered a twist or two in life that's all, ""I'm *totally* not friends with girls because they're all about *drama*, you know?"" (the irony...)

Trust me when I tell you, men like women who can be *women*.  They'll take it, emotions and all.  Be fine with that.  Like the guys upthread who will say that someone will love you no matter how you look, they'll also love you for your womanly emotions also.

I would bring my girlfriend chocolate and write her a note or something with flowers, and bring her friend something (obviously less nice, like just a chocolate as to not make my girlfriend jealous)

Then I'd visit for a little bit, kiss my girlfriend goodnight and tell her I loved her.  She would say it back, but then ask me to ""say it to Lexi too"" (the friend) and then tell me I'm a fucking awkward weirdo for being uncomfortable with it.

A medic sticks a syringe into you and the pain goes away, and you have this odd urge to keep fighting when you know you really shouldn't buy you pick up your gun and mow down ten men before you have to reload anyway. The only release is the sweet mercy of being vaporized by an airstrike. Of course it's the most selfish thing to wish for, side if you die nothing is left to stop the unspeakable horrors the enemy will wreak upon the civilians more as a matter of custom and tradition than any practical gain. "
Shit.
"I have no idea. It can't be that important to women or else less endowed men wouldn't have gotten to pass it on. But I think we've tied it to masculinity over time. A well endowed man is masculine  no matter what and it will trump most any other feature in that context. Funny looking? Bald? No beard? No muscle tone? No biggie man because  you got a hog down there! And if its bigger than another man's then you win! Also if you're small then everything you do will be tied compensate. E

Even though  we hate it we play into it. We allow something we have no control over and from what we can gather has very little practical effect on our lives to have so much sway."
"That’s is funny. Reminds me of my aunt who was walking down some street near her home in Mexico. Two gangbanger girls approach her and one of them pokes something sharp against my aunt’s back and tell her it’s a knife. They demand my aunt’s money and my aunt gets furious. 

Aunt (in Spanish): What the hell do you mean “give me your money?” I’m not giving you my hard earned money. Get a job you dumb bitches.

"Lmao! Had a somewhat similar experience freshman year of high school. I lived about a mile from my school so I used to walk home. One day I was walking home and I was already in my neighborhood near the street when some guy behind me asked me if I wanted to buy an iPhone. I was clearly confused and said no. Then he asked if I knew how to unlock an iPhone to which again I said no. And then he said, ""This is a robbery give me your money!"" I, clearly confused (almost laughing really since this isn't a bank robbery lmao), say, ""What?"" And turn around. To which he repeats himself and I see the knife by his side. I take out my wallet with about $15 and had him my cash. He takes the $10 and hands me $5 back and says he doesn't need it (the fuck?). Then as he walks away he said next time he'll take my backpack too. It's like um okay like what the fuck? Clearly the weirdest experience I've ever had. Now I'm more cautious when walking by myself and always check my surroundings. But yeah if you're gonna rob me at least take all my shit so I'm not left confused as hell lmao."

"Everything to do with eating is a huge habit. People forget that to eat more you have to break away from the feeling that you should be *eating less*. Like I've been eating the way I have for my whole life and I've always been right above the line that my doctor considers ""dangerously underweight"".

"There's some wiggle room there still, technically. I would assume that any wish would have lots of details that you probably haven't considered and so have no active intentions or desires concerning.

So if you say ""I wish for a boat,"" but don't explicitly intend or desire for the boat not to be an already existing cruise ship in your front yard, then the genie could pull a cruise ship out of the ocean and put it in your front yard. You didn't intend or desire to have a cruise ship in your front yard, but this action doesn't contradict what you did explicitly intend and desire.

You could lawyer way out of that particular and many other situations, of course. You could even try ""my wishes have no explicitly unintended side effects,"" but this might make it impossible for you to wish for things at all, since every particle of air displaced is a side effect, and you would have to intend every possible side effect of your wish for it to work.

Maybe try ""I wish that all my wishes will achieve what I intend and desire, and also that no side effects of my wishes are such that I, as I am at the time of the wish making, would disapprove of if I had thought of them, and that this wish be granted in a way conforming to these requirements."" 

(There might still be a loophole, none immediately come to mind.)"
"But isn't the genie legally required to obey your wishes? That's like the whole point of the genie yeah? Him throwing in diabolical twists that ruin your life is his way of ""rebelling"" against the chains by which he is bound, as I always understood it.

So, therefore, he would have to grant your first wish regardless of whether he was good or evil. Maybe he could throw an evil twist on it like ""if you wish for something that isn't truly what your heart desires you get what your heart desires instead, making your wishes unpredictable"" but he couldn't outright ignore your wish."

"I've always been interested in this. My older sister says we were abused, but she fell pretty heavy into drugs and is kind of crazy now. I have so many like... fragments of memories and unexplained dreams and I don't know what to make of it all. 

I had a dream that my classmate was kissing me (there were no sexual feeling in this dream. I didn't like him. He was really big and fat and mean) and he was holding me down and hitting my face with his pursed lips, around my mouth and then he held my arms down and opened my mouth with another hand and spit a bunch of stuff in my mouth. He then said ""oh, it's probably just the pills"" and that's all I remember. 
It was a dream, but I remembered it really well when I woke up, I know I did because I avoided the classmate from then on. It wasn't until I was giving a bowjob as a teenager that I remembered it again. 

Another memory that wasn't a dream was waking up in my back of my dad's car. My sister was there, also asleep. My dad friend said something like ""and she's got tits now so that helps"" and my dad was like ""yeah she's filling out for sure"" (talking about my sister, I didn't have any boobs yet) and I felt so groggy and I was laying on the seat and I asked where we were going and my dad asked how long I'd been awake.

I don't know if I've repressed anything, but if I have I hope it stays there. My mental health has been good lately."

They ask me if the day will be discounted and I tell her that unless it's medical leave then yeah and it sucks because I know that person is a hard worker but down to brass tacks (if I'm using that idiom correctly) we have to treat people equally in the same tier (seniority/hierarchical rank). Of course my boss does as he/she pleases but they earned that privilege.

I started at an oil and gas facility in a somewhat safety critical position. The entire first week I was  doing training courses and meetings with other managers and what not. I could not keep my eyes open. I was exhausted every day and finally was pulled into the head of the departments office and scolded for it. I understood why he was mad but didn’t get why I was doing it. The last straw was when my wife and I went to a Jerry Seinfeld stand up comedy show and I fell asleep during his entire bit. Went to the doc and I had a bad case of mono. Ended up being off work for the next 3 weeks. I was just happy there was a reason I was being a piece of shit.

You print some models you find online for a while, but you want to make something from scratch.  Wait, you don't have any experience with 3D modeling or CAD?  Uh oh...

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.

My I store girl called the cops twice on T and he manager to get away with it both time with enough in his system to blow over. I maybe worked on their shifts once a week and they did it all the time according to everyone else.


My aim was to get orders out the door and get my paycheck at the end of the week. I was a shift manager with less than no control over any of the staff ranging from 21-65 years old. 

I told my superiors and the cops were told at times. What else should I have done beyond quit? Cause that's what I did. But it's not like I could undo their actions or mine or anyone elses. I made pizzas and was forced into being a shift manager becaus I had the most experience. I'd never touched alcohol in my life once.

Unfortunately I spent a bit of money preparing to do snow removal to get through the winter and we had an incredibly light winter. I think I plowed twice the entire time. I ended up selling everything and not continuing the next year but I look back at it and it was fantastic.

I understand that most men are “fine” with the way my business looks and it “doesn’t matter”, but of course everyone wants to be THE MOST attractive and drive whoever you’rd with absolutely crazy with desire.  And so it’s just kind of disheartening to know that yours isn’t ideal. Second best. Good enough. Plus I watch a documentary once about how “messy” vulvas require more censorship than “tidy” ones.

"First day teaching. I was fresh out of college in the middle of a school year (December graduate). I was hired as a long term substitute for a classroom that'd seen 6 substitutes in as many months. I had ZERO experience as a teacher beyond teaching merit badges at boy scout camp. I was hired because I had the appropriate degree, I knew quite a few other teachers, and I was willing to try. I was given a laptop, a copy of the text book, and roughly 3 weeks worth of lesson plans. My first class would be a English 9 class. I went in the weekend before to get my classroom setup and make sure I was ready for my first day. I memorized the class roster and familiarized myself with everything I possibly could for the first day. 

Class started at 7:30AM and half the class was absent. Great. I start doing the roll and get through the list when a young lady sitting on the side next to the windows asks if she can get up to go to the restroom. 'Could it wait 10 minutes?

She replies ""Just some vitamins, i want my baby to grow up strong."" After a while the second woman puts something in her mouth as well, the other two ask what was that?! ""just an herbal supplement, i want my baby to be healthy"" they continue for a bit and the third woman sets down her needles and takes some medicine, the other two ask ""what was that?!"" and she replies ""Thalidomide, I can't get the damn arms to match."""

Obviously not the kind of sexual assault to get locked up for, but it was still sexual assault and the normalization of ""lesser"" behavior is part of what leads to people escalating their behavior.

Besides, your education doesn't depend on knowing where you live anyway. I'm from the UK and never learned anything more than being shown England on a map, in regards to where we lived.

But then I played BotW, and it did everything TP did but better, so today my fav game would probably be Breath of the Wild. I legit cried after I defeated the final Boss in that game, it really did feel like a culmination of the entire series into one awesome game."

I've proven multiple time I'm not the person I used to be and I refuse to go down that road again. My family is proud of how far I've come and who I am now. Except for my one sister. She harbors so much resentment towards me that it blinds her from seeing I'm not that person anymore. She still thinks I'm a junky despite there being zero merit to her claims. She uses my behavior during my addiction years to justify her cruel treatment towards me. Everything comes back to the pills. My family has tried to talk to her and help her see the changes but she's convinced I've manipulated them. What really hurts is she's working on her Ph.D in Psychology at Stanford but is blind to her own sister.

"As someone who did the walking away (and I know broke the heart of my ex husband), those years absolutely did not mean nothing to me. Relationships shape who you are, for better or worse, so the experience is never a waste. Compassion, support and love for years are never wasted either. It’s very possible that your wife is grateful for the good that came from your relationship and the years you shared, even if she feels that this is the time to move on. Cherishing the past and wanting different things in the future are not mutually exclusive. To think that just because she changed her mind now negates everything that you are or were does a disservice to you. 

You have value, with or without her. Your feelings and your relationship had value. Starting over is hard as hell. But this too shall pass, and one day you will wake up and realize you feel a little better. I am rooting for you in the meantime. "

It makes no sense, yar, spoilers be ahead.

So, we know that WWI is taking place in this movie, and we, the audience know that WW2 is right around the corner.  The logical, and frankly only sensical ending is to have Ares revealed, fight him, defeat him and find out that he wasn't controlling anyone anyway... only thriving off the chaos and giving subtle nudges to weapons development.  After defeated, the War continues because mankind is corrupt enough on it's own.

Hello There 
"If you can use that as an excuse for not calling, why can't your friend?"
My mom was very pushy in that I needed to make friends. I was a very introverted kid who did have one close friend and I enjoyed my alone time but she always told me to cultivate my friendships and she couldn't understand that this was something I was going to do with my own pace and way. It really affected me growing up . I am in my 20s now and I have a lot of close friends but my teenage years were a constant social anxiety which she didn't help with at all by this attitude. Her weird fear of me being friendless was very stressful and I've had to put some hard limits on what she can ask me about my friends or not.

"Charity work (mowing lawns, moving people,  and many other things), My parents were very religious and volunteered us all the time to help people out for the church. I had to do so many things for free and didn’t mind it that much until people started taking advantage of us.  They would wait till their lawns would be 3 feet tall to call us to cut it with a push mower. They also would have us move hoarders all the time and buy groceries for needy families. These “needy” families would be eating better stuff than we had when we would deliver them. I am talking about eating steak and potatoes. I did build some character doing these things but I also learned not to trust people and the church. I still hate mowing lawns to this day. "

She restated the ultimatum and I told her that in a year when he's embroiled in controversy and his incompetence incontrovertible, maybe she'd see that getting dumped over a foolish orange fuckstick like that particular man was the wrong way to go, and to just IMAGINE how she would react if the man she was dating told her to pipe down regarding politics on her Twitter.

"Guys, about your friends? What I've noticed in my lifetime of two marriages and many boyfriends:

If a guy's friends/family are kinda dumb, loud, rough, into put-downs; low-rent, low-responsibility, ""playahs""?  That guy  turns out to be a jerk too, usually pretty quickly.

When a guy's friends are well-mannered, kindly, considerate people, handling responsibility well in their lives?  The guy turns out to be a keeper.

"I had a college friend, we'll call him A, who was a part of our friend group, all Chemical Engineering students. He was a very large yet very nice guy, who was also religious. I even was partners with him during a design project that went pretty well.

Anyways, so one of our friends had gotten horrible news: Her mother had passed away due to brain cancer. A and another friend basically spent the whole day with her to comfort her and basically mourn together. In fact, they even all spent the night together. The three of them all slept in the same bed, and this is where the inexplicable shit happened.

Basically, in the morning, when the girl who's mother had just died woke up, she found A molesting her (fingering her). I was shocked when I heard about it and never talked to him again. And for those wondering, she did not press charges because she didn't want to go through that long process and just wanted to focus on getting herself mentally right."
"I'll cite my opinion from Titanic's love story.  

Cal Hockley was bailing out two broke women by marrying Rose, who he never even fucked before marriage was on the table.  He had enough respect to take them on the most expensive vacation experience of the period, not disrespect Rose sexually, and he went so far as to express his commitment to her that he sought out the finest diamond on the market as a symbol of his willingness to invest whatever it took to make her happy.  

He put up with her deviant and childish behavior, her back-talking in front of others to embarrass him and undermine his judgment, and she did not defend him from her predatory mother.

She actually deceived him by concealing their impoverished position, by taking advantage of his graciousness, and by eye-fucking gutter rats on the ship.  

Really, you're going to fuck a homeless dude in a stolen car over Cal?  Cal could've had any piece of ass he wanted, but he chose Rose, never giving any indication he was adulterous, and he even tried to make the relationship still work after he discovered she was deceiving him behind his back.

Women culturally promote this idea that a man should take care of his woman, be trustworthy, pay to impress them, provide them with status, be secure, trustworthy, and have social qualities that impress their parents. 

Cal embodied all of these things, yet women sided with the love story narrative with Jack as the savior of Rose, when he quite literally was a broke opportunist who fucked over Cal by taking advantage of his young and emotionally unstable cunt of a fiance.  The honorable thing would have been to speak with Cal privately, man-to-man, explain what he encountered with Rose.  

He should've said, ""Cal, I know I'm a broke drifter with no education, and I recognize that your relationship with Rose is none of my business Bro, but I want to be honest about what happened."" 

""Your homegirl is suicidal and emotionally unstable.  She tried to kill herself, then keep me from telling you.  It would be inappropriate for me to have dinner with you and her, because I do not want to partake in masquerading in a false narrative that is morally deceptive to you, the man who loves her and wants to marry her.""

""Futhermore, I thought you should know this information prior to marrying her so it can be addressed and resolved privately between the two of you, to which I hope will ensure the success of your marriage and happiness.  I seek no compensation for my service in pulling her off the rail, and I will keep this knowledge private because I realize discretion is important for someone in your position.""

""I'm sorry it had to be me to tell you all this, but your fiance needs your help and care.""

Everything Jack did was deceptive, disrespectful, immoral, and self-serving, except for pulling that crazy bitch off the rails.  

The irony is when you examine the context of his behavior relative to our cultural expectations and pressures as men.  Women will flip flop on how they frame romance, creepiness, and harassment based on superficial reasoning.  Like Titanic, much of it is merely an illusion of rational ideas.  

The fact is, if you have a sense of humor, are charming, and your female prey is vulnerable, you can be broke and deceptive and a woman will overlook everything wrong if they are attracted to you.   If not, they reframe SOME natural  male behavior as predatory and offensive, when it isn't.  It's often an emotional response, not a rational one.  This is critical because as men we try to be rational with our mating strategies and refine them because we want to be successful, not creepy offensive.  The problem is that the subjective perception of that behavior by people is often emotional and irrational based on everything from a woman's insecurities, feelings of contempt for some men based on previous relationships, and level of attraction.  

Not all sexual harrassment is harrassment, though some is.  And regardless of the prevailing pressures on men of being perfect providers and charmers, none of it means jack shit when it comes to emotional decisions of women.  

Women and society can be so God damned irrational that a movie like Titanic makes billions and is accepted as a moral story about love and disaster.  Jack is the hero who emerges, and Jack and Rose prosaically get the last laugh when it is revealed poor heartbroken Cal later committed suicide.

Even elderly Rose feels no shame in relaying this horrible information, with her directly being a contributing factor in Cal's ultimate feelings of despair, which eventually lead to his suicide.  

Fucking crazy bitch.  By all means, keep framing yourself as the victim.  But I'm glad her precious Jack became a lice-infested popsicle because fuck him and fuck Rom-Com logic in women's emotional and irrational expectations of men.  

As we have now just discovered with elderly Rose, many women are not Rom-Com princesses if their logic is self-serving and flawed by attraction and delusion.  You can't base male expectations on that kind of thinking.  Titanic's popularity among women is a testament to how pervasive this hypocritical and cunty movie logic can be.

Rom-Coms and romantic dramas can be equally damaging to society when their dysfunctional emotional logic is adopted and trusted to be morally valid.  The resulting labels and expectations and pressures on men are equally as unfair as the female stereotypes in Hollywood of how women should look, speak, and behave for them to be attractive or successful or to have status and be admired and revered. 

Fuck romantic comedies and fuck Rose.

You know what I hate most?  

That fucking whistle.  If it wasn't for that God damned whistle she would have not been rescued, but rather froze out there with that skinny bullshit artist boyfriend of hers.

Fuck that whistle.  The only valuable thing the whistle could have saved was the diamond, but that eventually still ended up in the ocean anyway."

They live in Ch'orti' aldeas in the hills and many still live without electricity. They are politically unmotivated, disenfranchised,  and uninvolved but very proud of their heritage.

In Honduras, most Ch'orti' only speak Spanish. They are very involved in the local politics and are actively trying to take stewardship of the ruins of Copán, which they claim to be directly descended from.

It had no magical properties and my wizard didn’t even have powerful magic yet.  

This guy got upset at the fact my character had a “cane sword”. But didn’t have the proper martial skill to use it.  And proceeded to belly ache and harass me and the DM.  To the point of being annoyed enough the DM ended the session and he continued to such a degree over the next few days the DM killed the whole campaign out of sheer incredulity that such a powerful character would take issue with such an inconsequential detail."

"Guy just joined our game. He was a previous dm we had awhile back, but the game broke up, as everyone else quit. So my husband decided to try dming. We invited our friends from the last group, and the dm heard about it. On maybe session 4, it’s now myself, sister, and one other player when the old dm comes in. I was working on a new character, one with a personality and flaws, my first time not just doing what the group told me to do. 

So the old dm is super intense through the whole session. He’s really animated, talking over everyone, and telling everyone else what to do. Gets to my turn, and I’ve been doing what my character would (she’s badass, but due to personal issues, doesn’t fight unless she feels it’s the right thing to do). A group of sharks appear behind our boat. I’m a Druid, and they have done nothing at this point. He first wants me to use a lightning spell, I say no. Next round, they still aren’t attacking. He wants me to shapeshift into a water elemental and destroy them. I again refuse. He begins to get angry and overly animated, demanding things be done. So I went out of character and tried to explain myself (I was tired of being yelled at and told I was wrong) and he leaps across the couch away from me, now freaking out that this is player knowledge and he doesn’t need to know. 

Also, he wouldn’t let me use spells or actions I have to figure him out, because he didn’t want us to know what he has/was up to. Even though he just appears in our party out of nowhere, and my character is highly suspicious. Of course my newbie dm husband sides with him in the moment, but I explained after the game that it was wrong. Oh, and the old dm kept making us play longer, by asking a billion questions and saying “well I’m doing this next” for an hour after we said everyone worked the next day. I finally told my sister to just leave, and the second the game ended the other player jumped up and left because he had an hour to drive home. He was not invited back. 

Edit: omg I left out the craziest part! The following week he posts to fb about how if you hear voices in your head, you’re not schizophrenic, it’s some higher power of empathy, and the voices help you figure out who people are. And that anyone who medicates, with legal or illegal drugs, is taking away from this power and should stop immediately.  It’s one of his things, make a fb post and comment 50 times on it. We thought he was just weird, or on something. In the comments it becomes clear that he’s one of those empathetic people, ie schizophrenic and off his meds. "

"Honestly, I don't know. Maybe she just found me attractive or something, but she went from 0 to creepy within minutes of meeting her. We had our initiation together and she wasted like no time in telling me about how she was bi (""but don't tell the guys, that's *our* secret, ok? *wink*"") and that she was married but it was cool because she and her husband were swingers so she could sleep with who she liked. This was in the first 10 or 15 minutes of meeting her.

Over the next week or two this progressed to her telling me, in greater and greater detail, about her sex life. What she liked, what she didn't like, how much she liked sleeping with women, what sort of women she liked (hey and guess what the descriptions sounded kind of like me!) and getting just way too close. She never explicitly said ""hey I want to bang you"" but it was pretty much implied. In the end, when she started asking me what *I* like, had I ever been with a woman or had a threesome, etc, I told her that I didn't think these conversations were appropriate for work and she was making me uncomfortable, so I'd appreciate it if she could stop talking to me about all that stuff. I probably should have spoken up sooner but I was just so damn uncomfortable I didn't even know what to say.

She went from always wanting to talk to me every shift to ice queen almost immediately. Started setting me up for mistakes. Biggest one (where I'm pretty sure her intention was to get me fired), I'd just come in to start my afternoon shift, she said ""Oh, this customer is having trouble setting up their new 3DS, could you set it up for them?"" and left me alone. I set up the 3DS and sent the customer on their way, only for them to come back a few minutes later saying she was never actually charged for the 3DS (co-worker made it sound like it was *already* her DS, just couldn't set it up, we always had people bring in their own consoles from home to set up for them, that's what I assumed this was - besides if it wasn't paid for yet, she shouldn't have been setting it up). 

Co-worker claimed she had explicitly said ""I'll let you handle this sale"" and went running off to the manager screeching about how I had given away a 3DS for free. She seemed so disappointed when the manager decided that since the customer had come back to pay, no harm done, but just told me to be more careful in the future.

I was so glad when I got another job a couple months later lol. She still works there though, so I never go in any more."

"This is a kind of a sweet uncomfortable moment. So my husband, he has been impatiently waiting for my son to be old enough to play D&amp;D with. He’s 6 now, so my husband DMed a campaign with my son and me. We started in a small farm town, but we were both adventurers just passing through. This was just my husband’s way of having our characters meet in a pretty low key way.

My son, bless his heart, is doing a great job asking questions and looking around when he comes to a blacksmith. The blacksmith introduces himself and asks John, my 6-year-old, who he is and why he’s here. John’s character, decked out in a bow and arrows, daggers, a sword, a whip, and armor says, without missing a beat, “I want to be a farmer.”  

My husband tries to coax him in the right direction. “Wow. You sure have a lot of weapons. You aren’t an adventurer, are you? We could really use an adventurer.” 

John says, “Ok... bye...” and walks away, Ha! He just really wanted the campaign to become Harvest Moon. 😂"

"I think the biggest confusion here  though is what is considered to be a ""big"" penis. I mean sure 90% of women(well people in general) don't want to sit on an anaconda which porn tends to convey people do seeing everyone in porn land seems to have at-least a 10 inch dong but I mean the average penis in the real world is somewhere in the 5-6 inch range depending on which statisdick you look at and I bet my king nut that there are many (not all because different strokes for different folks) people  (men/women everything in between) in this world who would really enjoy a 7.5/8inch dong in them if it was wielded correctly and wasn't like a coke can.  People are also horrible at accurately measuring things with their eyes and guys lies all the time so I think people are confused to what actually is a say 6  inch penis or 8 inch penis or a 10 inch penis.   

I kinda lost the trail of where I was going with this I think I just wanted to add my 2 cents and to also point out I personally find it hilarious  the fact that there are many camps in the dicksize war which is mostly about is bigger better and yet everyone seems to think they belong to the biggest camp.

One time we gathered up our group and just made a circle and started screaming as if people were fighting and when the staff started to approach one friend would lay on the ground and everyone else would take off running. They told us to stop so like ten of us started playing follow the leader. As we marched around the school more and more kids started to join our line. Staff told us to stop again but at this point we thought there’s way too many of us for everyone to get in trouble so we kept marching around. We ended up with like 30 kids marching around in a line playing follow the leader and after the leader took off running we all chased him. We thought we couldn’t get in trouble but by the end of the day we had all been given referrals and got lunch detention.

Maybe it isn't the most lucrative major, but it's a great way to differentiate yourself from the people you're competing with--ESPECIALLY those in STEM--if you can pick up a minor or certificate. I wound up doubling, as did everyone who graduated with the degree in my graduating class. It was easy to do because so many of the classes were cross-listed. Several have gone on to law school and social work. I taught in higher ed and work in publishing. Some are working at or running crisis centers and aiding with sexual assault survivor outreach. All decently paying careers related to our interests. True, without additional schooling many of us wouldn't have that, but if you hustle and find a mentor, an internship, or a grad school plan, you should be able to do well. I don't like seeing this degree get shat on because it's just not accurate to say there aren't jobs.

So there we was, walking through the dungeon, when a pack of wild bandits attacked us!

After complaining angrily to the dm, he gave chase to the bandit. We eventually caught him, to which the bandit offered the bow and information for his life. WOOT INFO! Always handy.  Unfortunately the fighter decided that he was going to assert his angry self into the game and kill the bandit. ""I cut off his head."" The group argued to at least let us get info and the dm explained that he had already surrendered. All of which just got ""I cut off his f***ing head!""

We have a seven year old who is the best thing in my life, so I put up with things. I make plenty of money and our lifestyle is intentionally simple, so her financial dependency is a minor irritation.  But in another 12 years or so when our son is ready to move on with his life, I won't have a reason to stay.  "

"To add to this great advice: if you go down on a girl, don’t use a pointy tongue. Porn gets that wrong soooo often. Or if you finger her, don’t use only the tips, try the flatter bits of finger when rubbing (near the) clit. And don’t just fingerbang her like your fingers are dicks, focus on the clit (too). 

This is general advice and some girls may like the exact opposite. But like OP said, clits are like really condensed dick and balls, pointy stimulation is more often than not going to be too much. "

"So during my first year at Uni I struggled to get to sleep almost every night. For most of those nights I tried to get to sleep by being drunk or high - eventually I spoke to a doctor and got sleeping meds but that’s besides the point.

So one night I went to this park near my halls to self medicate and go for a walk. Now I struggle with depression and anxiety, so I am really in my element when I’m walking with nobody around as far as the eye can see and with just like some music playing on my headphones or just thinking about stuff - working stuff out in my head.

Anyway so it’s around 1:30 AM and I’m walking in this park and I’m quite high. Now so long as there’s nobody coming toward me or capturing my attention idc, and I’m chill. But when there would be the paranoia kicks in super hard and my anxiety starts to go haywire, making me want to turn around and walk other ways, to run and hide in the bushes or whatever, it’s really daft and quite funny when you think about it but it feels necessary at the time.

So I’m just listening to some mellow music and walking, when at the other side of this park I see someone with a torch - and that’d be fine if they weren’t like, scanning the park with the torch like they were searching for someone. So I see this - much brighter than average may I add - torch beam glide around the park and it passed me at one point but at that stage it just disturbed me. 

However,

While I thought I could see that they were walking the long way round to where I was, I was walking much faster than I realised, and while I was walking counter-clockwise around this park and so were they, I was accidentally catching up with them. They hadn’t shone their torch about in like 5 minutes and so I didn’t realise where they were - it was a dark night in a biiig park. But yeah so I’m just walking around this park in my thoughts when around 40 metres in front of me this torch light comes back.

It’s scanning around the park and this guy is shining it from the far end away from us both in an arc coming toward me. In retrospect this guy was probably a bit like me, taking a walk to clear his head and was just a bit nervous about other people being in the park, so he was taking what he thought was a precaution against someone sneaking up on him and attacking him or whatever.

Naturally when he turned his torch and suddenly illuminated this young man in a tracksuit (it was a cold night) only 40 metres away walking in his direction it must have scared the shit out of him.

But I mean, I was wearing headphones, I wasn’t exactly barrelling toward him (naturally I’d slowed my pace as this dude was shining his torch about), and I raised my hand in a sort of ‘ow that light is really bright’ kind of way.

So the guy turns his torch off and keeps walking (thankfully), and I resolve to take a different path leading away from him and toward a nearby exit, thinking he was probably spooked + I didn’t fancy having that torch shone in my face again for obvious reasons.

But anyway this dude clearly let his nerves get to him because about 30 seconds later his torch came back on - he was shining it right where he’d last seen me, back on the path which I had now left, so there was nothing there. This guy then starts scanning about again and I’m watching this, and thinking ‘will this guy just leave me alone now? I’m trying to mind my own business too, I’ve changed my route for his benefit, what the fuck else does he want?’ 

So as he’s panning his torch around he passed me with it, and I’ve turned to face him as I’m watching what he’s doing and when the beam passed me he did that thing where he didn’t register what he saw until a moment later and then brought the torch back at me- like in a horror movie when the monster is hiding and the character gets a torch and spots it. So I just raise my middle finger to him. Didn’t say a word but I knew he got the message.

He clearly jumped to the worst conclusion that I was trying to scare him or whatever, but honestly he never considered that I didn’t care about the fact he was there and just wanted to be left alone, same as him. I’ve seen him around since when on a jog there (I found exercise an hour or so before bed has helped more in the long term), and he’s still shining his bloody million candle torch about, but I just avoid him and he clearly realises I’m just minding my own business. 

But yeah it creeped me the fuck out, but I bet if he were ever to tell it from his perspective it’d have been an even creepier story about a big dude (I’m 6’ and weigh in at 17 1/2 stone) in a tracksuit following him and then disappearing before flipping him off. Lmao."

"I think the choice of Poussey was perfect for what they wanted to convey. Any other black inmate we see is kinda morally grey. Cindy is a bad person, Taystee did bad things that you could not sympathize with unless you knew her story. Janae was just straight unlikable.

Poussey was in on minor drug charges, she was literally like a puppy she was so sweet. She was the only character that fully didnt deserve to be where she was at. Knowing that and still seeing how mcc tried to rebrand her into a thug. Taking photos when she was at a party to convey she was a criminal wouldn't resonate as much if theyd used another character who was pretty shady but we just liked them anyway.

That said it really did suffer without her, it should have been a later plot imo."
"Oh shut the fuck up. That's every fucking stay at home mom relationship too then. If you're a misogynistic twat feel free to reduce it to those terms, but adults in real relationships are capable of finding value in each other's company in ways that extend far beyond economic transactions.

If you're just a wallet to her and she's just a whore then you're both wretched humans whose ""relationship"" will crumble the moment your bank account runs out or her tits fall down.

You come off like a craven piece of shit. Sometimes people of vastly different economic means can still have relationships. Whether that's a guy footing the bill or a cougar. Anyone can joke about having a sugar momma or daddy, but that doesn't make the less wealthy one a literal whore."

Aside: I think in the 'top untapped markets' infographics online writing is usually a top 5 one, which correlates to the people who google stuff and try to get us onboard.

I always ask about the money.  Invariably, they tend to either offer nothing or have a totally unsustainable business model where it's both too little in the way of payment *and* I have no clue where they're getting that money on an ad-free platform.

And of course, they can't get audiences without having decent authors and they can't get decent authors on their aggregate platform without having decent-sized audiences (and/or the money those audiences can provide the platform."

"I don't care if the thing is internal so long as it can get the job done when it's time.  Honestly, I prefer shorter length for comfort, the g spot isn't very far in. Most don't want a cervix punch. I really couldn't care what a penis looks like when not in use unless there's tentacles or spider legs. "
"I don't think it's so much that they don't care at all, in general, as that it's not a deal breaker.  It's not the most important thing, by a long shot.  Any woman for whom a single physical characteristic is a deal breaker is probably not worth your time anyway.  

Would most women prefer a man who's a little taller than them? Probably.  But it's a preference, it's not the final word. A tall man has that one thing to recommend him to more women than a short man does, but it's just one of things that makes him attractive.  It's not ""the thing"".  But if you are short and you act like it's ""the thing"" though, that's now an actual strike against you, because being insecure and dealing with that in a negative way, really is a deal breaker.  

TLDR; Some dipshits will rule you out over height; you don't want them anyway.  For most women it's just a thing they don't care that much about if YOU don't.

"Many years ago my dear sweet cat Alex passed away at 17 years of age.  We were in the yard digging a grave for him when our pool service showed up to open the pool in the spring.  I was in tears so I just went in the house.  They went to use the garden hose and over the winter the pipe had cracked so when they tried to use the hose water began gushing into the house.  I removed the sillcock and was peening the crack in the pipe closed and soldering it to seal it.  One of the pool service staff came into the garage and began to ask me  how it was going when suddenly he exclaimed with a shriek “IS THIS CAT DEAD ??”  Apparently he saw the cat lying on the bench and began petting him.  I guess the cold body in full rigor must have been the giveaway.  I turned to look at him and the look of horror was very pronounced.  I have never seen a team of people open a pool faster and disappear.
I was just really sad at the time having lost one of the most wonderful creatures I have ever had in my life.  In hindsight though, the humor here is pretty hard to miss !!"

"Started losing hair myself at age 12! By 15 I couldn't put gel in my hair without my classmates pointing out they could see my shiny skull. After looking like a 40-year-old by age 18, I just shaved it all off. Good thing about Europeans is that by age 25, 70% of my classmates were balding. By then I had already been accustomed to my new hair style and all my girlfriends who liked it as well. These confident college classmates suddenly started to lose their mojo, covering up their hair with caps, and started looking for hair transplants on the net to get back their manly manes. Once you hit 30 or so, nobody cares since we're all bald and got great wives or partners. Now I'm caring more about the belly I've been developing, my teeth getting worse, white chest hair popping up, and nose hairs poking out. Second puberty here I came! Basically, some women might want the guy with George Clooney hair, majority settles with bald guys with personality as they get older!"

"That is exactly our situation with my grandmother right now. We had her in an independent living home up until Memorial Day weekend, when we discovered she had a cancerous tumor on her brain. After emergency surgery to try and remove it, she refused to do any of the physical therapy needed to go back to her independent living home. So my parents had to scramble to find a nursing home with a medicaid bed, all while jumping through the multitude of hoops necessary to qualify for both medicaid and VA benefits for her. And through all this, my grandmother has done nothing but scream and complain about how she hates the nursing home she's in, despite the fact that the only reason she's there is b/c she didn't want to get out of bed to do the therapy. And now she can't get out of bed anymore. My parents can't have her living in their home b/c they can't afford the 24/7 nursing care she would require and she can't get up and down their stairs. They would also probably go broke in no time, as they've already spent over $30K in the past few years supplementing her care in the first place. My dad has had to take out of his retirement in order to pay for her to live. And through it all, grandma has been grossly unappreciative of it all b/c it's never good enough for her. I know some of it is the tumor and some of it is b/c she's always had some narcissistic qualities but it's been really stressful for us all.  "

Then management got suspicious when they started noticing he had a high number of cancellations within the first few months.

Then one day, he slipped up. Called a guy, went through the speech, dude enthusiastically agrees to sign up. He finishes the call and ends with, ""All right dude, see ya tonight.""

Police eventually got involved, and since I’m replying to your post you know where this is going. They tracked the IP address to her house. Everyone hated her after this and her new friends pretty much abandoned her. She stuck around and people eventually moved on, but she was always kind of an outcast after that."

I was standing on the throat of the alert parking area, while we waited for a C-17 to come down. Those are huge cargo planes. It landed, and as it was taxiing by me, close enough to block the early morning sun, I looked up to take in the view. I had never been that close to an active aircraft at that point. When I looked up at the cockpit, the pilot was leaning out the window like James Dean, and he gave me a loose, left-handed salute. I sent him back a proper one, and I held it way longer than I needed to. I was just so awestruck by that.

I'm sure the pilot never gave it another thought, but I still think about that. I wish I could talk to him once. That personal moment made me feel extremely proud of the choice I made to enlist. It probably sounds silly, but it is what it is haha."

"I have a memory from the first time we went on the ferry near my parents house. My brother was about to turn one. I remember details from the day, like the smell of the salt water, the way the paint was chipped on the stairs, and watching my brother run around, but the weird thing is, my brother is 13 months older than me. My mom, dad and brother did go on the ferry ride, and I guess technically I was there, but my mom was 7 months pregnant with me. 

Added: what makes it more strange, I remember the colour of the boat, the colour of the stairs, and smaller details of it that you’d only know from looking at them. That ferry stopped running when I was 3, we never took a trip over to the island again until I was 8, and there are no photos of the trip from my memory. "

"Oh shit I remember working at the furniture store and this lady came in with a kid in a stroller and opened an account and furnished, like, a whole house that she was just about to close on. We ran her credit using the name given and it came back decent enough but also really short  for her age. We dug a little deeper, just for due diligence and found out she'd applied at one of our other stores with a *different* last name and was turned down. They faxed over the ID they had for her and bang! same photo. So we pulled the credit report using *that* name and holy shit it was terrible. Charge-offs, judgements, collections; I can't remember if Credit Scores were something we looked at as much back then, but hers would have been in the *negatives*, it was that bad. We also found out that the stroller she had with her *had been shoplifted from the other store.*  


So we called her and told her we were declining to extend her credit, and she acted surprised, and pointed out she had excellent credit. We said yes, Tina *Smith* had excellent credit, but Tina *Jones* did not qualify for credit with us. She was quiet for about ten seconds, then fucking exploded. Screaming at us that we had no right to pull credit under that name, we were not authorized to pull that report, that was illegal, we were committing fraud, and she was going to call every regulatory body she could to get us arrested for identity theft and punished. We just said we were sorry she felt that way and hung up.

Then we called the company that was mortgaging her house and gave them the heads-up and advised them to pull the report on her second name. 

She did not get the house, and we did not get back the stroller."

"At a warehouse I used to work at Best Buy had a spot in it and they did something with cell phones.

He got caught the same day when the boss was doing his daily reports and spotted an address he didn't recognize. The pallet had already been shipped out and the employee had left for the day so the police set up a sting operation and caught him signing for the pallet when UPS delivered it. 

He might have gotten away with it had he brought his own label from home but he clearly wasn't that smart since he used his own address to ship it to instead of a vacant home so it couldn't be so easily tied back to him."

"I work with a convicted child molester. (The kid in question was 15, which doesn't make it right, but I would've reacted very differently if it was a 5 year old.) Anyway, I was unaware of this person's past until one day someone fax-bombed all the offices in our building with her photo and info. My subordinate and I always came in early. She knew all about the case and filled me in. I considered what to do and concluded that since Ms. Child Molester had already made whatever restitution was required by our legal system, and her job would never, ever, put her in the company of minors, it was no one's business. I directed my subordinate to scoop up all those faxes and I disposed of them myself before our co-workers could see them. 

I never told Ms. Convicted Child Molester about this but sometimes I wonder if I should have because she's been a passive-aggressive bitch to me for most of my career, undermining me, sabotaging me and saying ugly things behind my back. One of us will be retiring in the next few years, and I'll be telling her how I once did her a great favor early in our careers and still kept my silence even though she's done nothing but shit on me. It will be interesting to see how she reacts, if at all.

Note: If you're wondering why I didn't return her bitchy favors by telling on her, it has never been relevant to her work, so I've tried to be the bigger person. She still does not work with minors, and considering the type of work she does, she never will. If she had ever gotten a job in which that might have been a possibility, I would've blown the whistle, no matter what our working relationship. "

"The selling point at a lot of these places is that you aren't forced to do these things, but they are available to you if you do. It also provides some flexibility into how you work. 

No one needs what you're working on immediately so you want to relax for a few hours and have a drink and play some Mario kart with a work friend? Go for it. Sure you might be there a few hours later than usual, but you get a chance to reset your brain. Don't want to do that? Fine. Grind out what you need to get done and leave work after 6 hours without having someone judge you for it. Also, a lot of these people genuinely just love the work that they're doing and like being around people with similar interests. 

At the last place I worked at the guys in my fantasy league would get off work, head down to the bar for free booze, get some food, and just put on four different football games in one of the lounges. So much easier than having to decide which house we go to, whether we need to be quiet because kids trying to sleep, what game to put on because there is only one TV, etc. Plus a lot cheaper because free booze and food. Like I said earlier, as long as they don't try to turn these things into mandatory events and treat you like children, the workplace doesn't necessarily need to be a place you want to get out of the second you can."

It's my absolute favorite time of year, but is so tragically short.

It's not cold and it's not hot. 

The weather alternates between clear, sunny blue skies and warm rain showers. 

Colorful flowers and trees are blooming everywhere.

Tropical birds arrive in droves, spring peepers sing on moonlit nights, brooks and ponds trickle through meadows and hillsides, filled to maximum capacity.

The days can get warm, but the nights are still cool enough for a good sleep.

I want to live where it's always spring."

"You also might get stuck by lightening on your way to winning the power ball. Just because it’s possible doesn’t mean it’s probable. I’ve worked as a teacher for years, and do summer camps and daycares in the summer for extra cash. I’ve definitely been in situations where kids get hurt ice skating, but the probability of *sawing a finger off* with an ice skate is nill. The worst thing I’ve ever seen is a parent take a skate to the face. 

There are a lot more dangerous things that can happen. That just seems...odd. 

If they’re actually concerned about dangerous situations, they should make sure that their instructors are first aid/CPR certified. That being said, what you’ll say you do versuses what you’ll actually do when a finger is on the floor are two probably very different things. "

If the dog is adopted at 10 (a puppy in the new dog lifespan) by a 25 year old, that's ~15-25 years where the human is more than likely dead or in a home. Obviously, the dog can't live with them at that point, the human's kids might not want to take him, and hardly anyone wants to adopt a dog that close to death (just look at shelters today). Something closer to 5-7x would be a better idea."

"My phone rang. ""America is being bombed"". 

It was 5am my time and about 6 hours after it all began for you guys. I sat bolt upright and smacked my head on the above bunk that I had forgotten in my haste. Between the phone ringing, the lump on my head, and the possibility of World War 3, I was now fully awake.

I spent the next three hours watching a continuous loop of footage on the five free to air tv channels we had back then and then started my two hour commute on public transport to uni. Every radio or TV I passed was tuned to the unfolding horror for our friends half way across the world. It was the quietest trip I ever took. No-one chatted. No-one spoke.

Got to uni and we waited in silence outside my lecture room for it to begin. A friend of mine comes up, all smiles, and starts telling me about her evening at work and wondering aloud if we've got time to grab a latte before class starts. She's just starting to tell me about her friend who's having yet another fight with her boyfriend when she realises everyone is looking at her. ""Dude, what the heck is going on? Everyone is being so weird today! Did someone die?"". I realised she'd somehow managed to get through the past four hours since she woke up without seeing one second of news. 

Lecturer arrived and cancelled classes for the day. Turned around and commuted the two hours back home and resumed my position watching endless loops of footage on five channels with my boyfriend. We didn't really speak..... because what could you really say?"
"Sorry for my english. Years ago my hometown had an electricity crisis. The power went out every single day for several hours. It was really bad and the corresponding authorities didnt take any responsibility. There was a lot of damage because the electricity was so unestable that everybody in town had lost at least one item due to shortcuts.
This guy owned a butcher shop and he lost everything (well Im not sure if everything but some big freezers and of course a lot of meat), so he went to the power company all enraged and explained his case and employees just ignored him, like ""well get a new freezer and stop complaining... next!"". They didnt offer him a solution, an explanation or at least an apology. They were fed up with people complaining for their terrible service. The guy made a scene (rightfully so) and demanded to speak with the manager. The manager came and had the same ""i dont care attitude"" so the guy just lost it. He went to his car and came back with a big plastic container. He poured the content on the manager and lighted a match. It was gasoline (or kerosene, i dont remember). The manager tried to scape but he hugged her to keep her there. This happened in a public office, on a normal work day with other people there. Both the manager and the butcher died later."
"3 weeks out of high school i got a minimum wage job working in a sweatshop. I worked 10 hrs overtime just about every week, paid my mom $50 for room &amp; board. I saved every other penny I could. I got a cheap car for transportation, continued to save all I could, and started going to business school at night. 50 hrs working a week, 20 hrs. school a week for a couple of years. After that, I've managed to get good paying jobs. I honestly don't know how I did it. I'm not rich, but I'm def not poor. I still worry too much about money, and I'm very careful with money. I still buy most of my clothing from the thrift store. Thrift stores today are way different then the rags we got a kids. Shoes I buy new. I own my own home. I'm warm in the winter because I have a working heater, and no boiling water on the stove to wash my hair. The one good thing I've learned from those poor times is that I can live without things and also I can fix things that are broken, I can sew, and I am great at improvising when I need to. "

I had been hearing the news all week and wanted to get back to some normalcy, but Saturday Morning Cartoons were cancelled and instead the channel had the news on all day.

I was pretty upset, not just because the news was dark, but also because I had been especially looking forward to Digimon after that rough week.

"I definitely went through this. I’ve had multiple surgeries to remove ovarian cysts. The last one was positioned weird and causing tons of pain higher than usual. I had multiple doctors brush me off. I kept at it and finally found an OBGYN who believed me and decided to do the vaginal ultrasound himself. There was a cyst big enough to need to operate (the previous one showed one small cyst on the left ovary). During the surgery, he discovered the cyst was on the right ovary. The reason they didn’t get the correct ovary is that the cyst was so big, it was lodged between the ovaries and basically moving all my organs around. It was about the size of a grapefruit. 

He told me later women know when something is wrong. "

Note that those hobbies of mine do generate income-they aren't just for fun. It's really rough and she cries sometimes that we never get time together and we have a conversation every now and then but there's really just nothing I can do about it right now. I want to buy a house this year or early next year, plus I'm helping pay for her tuition expenses. She understands why but it's visibly frustrating for her because she doesn't care as much about owning a house etc as I do but she's glad that I have goals and am working hard to achieve them. I have a feeling if I was just fucking off this whole time she'd be fuckin gone."

OR various feral child studies where kids are raised without language or skin to skin contact after they're weaned. One set of experiments you try to get the toddler to fall in with a group of social animals, maybe dogs who went wild after getting a taste for hunting, killing, and eating. Still like people, but also wild and not responsive to commands. Maybe some you put in gigantic enclosures like a solo mode hunger games and you make it solve puzzles or search around for supplies like food. Maybe some you raise in a clinical, low-stimulus setting with regular feeding and all visible surfaces have regularly spaced vetical lines (this had astounding results when we did it to [cats](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-food/201404/the-cat-nobel-prize-part-ii).

For each cohort, extract kids and try to teach them language and society at various ages. Let's say wean ASAP, no skin to skin after weaning, no speech at all in the presence of the kid (non-word sounds OK), and you leave it only when it is walking and somewhat dextrous, say around age 1.5 standardize the way they're isolated from humans somewhat, introduce experimental protocol around age 4 or 5, extract samples from cohorts at ages 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24, try to teach language and society, interview, record behavior."

"I have to bring to attention a few contradictions here. If you are simply a cog in the economic machine, isn’t that the final form of a group mentality? You are disposable for the betterment of the group, which goes against individualism. And yes, a dead gazelle handed to you is less satisfying than one you caught yourself, which one again supports the idea that individualism is a good thing. I think you made a few great points but it’s much more complex than simply abandoning a group mentality. If anything, social media has boosted this group mentality aspect, as you can see with political factionism and the overall idea of group think and trying to fit in. I’d say being concerned with yourself as an individual is definitely not a bad thing, but there’s obviously extremes in both scenarios. The extreme of a group mentality leads to “being a cog in the economic machine”, and the extreme of individualism is abandoning important relationships out of self interest and being just as mindless of a drone in either case.

There's an /r/empirepowers for 16th century style RPG, and I believe other historical ones that go back further. Unless I am mistaken, there are also futuristic versions of /r/worldpowers, and even a Game of Thrones one.

Unfortunately the one I was interested in is in hiatus right now, but if one of them appeals to you if you're reading this, you should check them out!

---

EDIT: here's a list as best as I can find them. Keep in mind some of them have very few people.

/r/worldpowers (As far as I can tell, the main one of the bunch, taking place in a more modern day setting)

/r/empirepowers (For your RP loving EU4 player :P Takes place in the 1500s onwards)

/r/SWWP (Second World War Powers. World powers but in WW2)

/r/HistoricalWorldPowers (Not seen much about this one, but it says it starts in the year 4000 BC and goes to modern day, so sounds like quite the journey!)

/r/GlobalPowers (More of a UN RP than a military or expansionist RP)

/r/ColdWarPowers (Cold War RP from the 50s - 90s presumably)

/r/SevenKingdoms (Game of Thrones World Powers. I have not looked into this one much but it seems like the most popular fantasy one that took off)

There are a few more but they seem to be more inactive/ fewer people. Take a look yourself and maybe you'll find one you like!"

"I think I've posted about it before, but the scariest thing I remember in full detail was walking back to my dorm from chem lab - for context, this would have been around 10:00, and I lived on the very quiet edge of campus. The lights along the sidewalk kept winking out exactly as I passed them. By the third one I think I actually stopped and looked around for god-knows-what because I was loopy from four hours of fumbling with titration and that timing seemed way too coordinated to be coincidental. Granted, every scenario *aside* from coincidence sounded like a bad horror movie, but I still gave the bushes a very, very wide berth for the rest of my walk."

"It worked out great for me IRL, but I should point out that we were both in really bad relationships.  my wife was married at the time, but she slept in the guest room and their relationship had really ended years before, they were just poor and depressed and never bothered with a divorce.   I had been seeing someone for like two years but hadn't been happy for a long time and as soon as I realized that I had feelings for someone else and didn't want o be with her I broke it off.  So .... there are times when it's a fine choice, but it's rarely the BEST choice. 

EDIT:  I should also point out that I did not expect anything good to come of it.  She and i were very close friends before the relationship and I just got it out there because if she was going to need to take a step away form me, I wanted to get it over with.  I never really expected her to return my feelings. "

But it felt like I was the special person who got to see the warm side of him - even if only rarely - and that felt like intimacy. And he admired the warmth and compassion I showed to people, so I figured it was something he valued even if he wasn’t always good at it. He also had a couple of breakdown moments, especially at the end, where it was obvious he was keeping a lot of emotions hidden from me (whether intentionally or not), so I know he had some emotional capacity, but it certainly was not a central feature during our time together.

&gt; What is the cause of discrimination against LGBT in India? 

Long story short: same as everywhere else in the world. Same-sex relations are not in the norm and thus considered ""unnatural"" and wrong to differing degrees by many. 

&gt; Religious? Cultural?

Ancient and Classical India (roughly 500 BC to like 1200 AD) had a relatively liberal stance on same-sex and transgender relations. We see evidence of this in scripture (svadharma concept), literature (kamasutra), mythology (Mohini and Shikhandi), potentially law at times, and art (poems and murals on temples(!)). This is not unique to India. Other classical cultures like the Greeks, Romans, Japanese, and Chinese also had somewhat tolerant views on same-sex relations. 

However, there was most likely still intolerance during these times, probably just because of human nature. Many argue that this intolerance was further cemented into the Indian psyche by the imposition of Victorian Christian morality on India's law and education systems. 

Edit: Please note that above I have been talking about same-sex relations and not same-sex marriage. Indian culture has been dominated by various schools of Hinduism for 4000 years. Hinduism has a flexible stance on same-sex relations. However, I can't think of any depiction or symbolism of same-sex marriage in Hinduism. I don't know if it explicitly forbids it but it certainly does not explicitly acknowledge it to the best of my knowledge. It does acknowledge transgenders as part of the Third Gender (a catch-all term broadly referring to LGBT+ people with some slightly different definitions) so this complicates the definition of marriage.

"Have you ever watched a kid throw something? They're fucking horrible at it. Cant hit shit, have no distance, and half the time the accidentally throw it behind them.

Practice. Hell, try throwing something with your off hand, I bet you suck at it because you haven't practiced it. That's what it boils down to. The people that cant throw for shit just haven't practiced enough. I'm assuming it's instinctual to learn how, but not everyone's instincts are the same. Lack of practice doesnt mean lack of talent"

"I got the perfect answer for this, I didn’t write this but it perfectly captures how I feel.

“I think it’s less that we “want to die” and more that many of us have an “indifference to staying alive.”

I don’t particularly want to die. There’s still movies I want to see, books I want to read, friends I want to spend time with. But if, say, I were diagnosed with incurable brain cancer today... I don’t know that I would be especially devestated.

I wouldn’t be thrilled, obviously. But a lot of that would come from the grief that I know my death would cause my family and friends; I detest making other people unhappy. But for me personally? Meh.

As for why, if I had to guess it’s because it’s very hard to see the point of it all. Life, that is. It’s not like my life is miserable, either; I’m not living like a rock star, but I have friends, family, a job. But what’s the endgame for me? Work 30-50 hours a week for the next 40-50 years with the slim hope of retirement so I can spend the last decade or so of my existence doing “what I want to do”?

The obvious answer is love. Which, ok, yeah maybe love is what makes life worth living. But how do we find love? Tinder? Hang out at a bar, or a festival, or whatever, and hope that by some incredible chance we find someone who makes life worth living? Go on a journey to find out soulmate? Except, whoops, don’t have time for that, gotta work all this week. Well, maybe during my vacation time (HAHAHAHAHHGAHGRHB) I’ll find someone.

And in the meantime, the planet, the literal, actual terra firma where we live, is actively being destroyed for the benefit of rich old bastards who won’t live long enough to suffer the consequences. But we will. I will almost certainly live long enough to hear a scientist say “we have passed the point of no return, the planet Earth is permanently damaged in a way we cannot fix”. That’s not hyperbole. That’s the future we’re heading towards.

So really the question should be: why shouldn’t millennial want to die, when the alternative (continuing to live) isn’t especially appealing?”"

We got married, she moved here but found it difficult to get settled and was uncomfy- especially that I was comfy (though I included her in everything; my friends and fam included her in things without me to make her get into her own) so we started fighting, she left to go back home:

Her: and I quote, ""I'm not coming back because more than one person told me that if you really loved me you would've been on the next plane 'winning' me back!""

Me: we're in our mid 30's, we talk shit out not test who's going to follow whom!

It’s sort of like trying to show a religious person that there’s no reason to believe in a magic man in the sky who’s secretly telling you to do things. If they’ve been believing that for their entire life, they’re not going to want to accept that it was all to satisfy someone else’s fantasy.

"Hmm... I'm starting to wonder if this actually happened to me.

After about a year, ex-gf wanted to break up.  It seemed like she wasn't happy in our relationship because she didn't think I was trying hard enough. (Truth be told, I think at the time I WAS trying hard, but I just was immature and clueless).  She said she wanted to break up.  

I asked her if she means it 100% and she breaks down in tears and says yes.  I was upset, but all I said was 'okay', turned around and headed home.  It wrecked me for a long time.

But after about a month of two, she would try calling me, or sending messages and I would ignore them with all my might.  I started to get bitter because why would she try contacting me after she was the one that wanted to break up?  After maybe 15 calls and just as many messages, I cracked and picked up and literally said, ""WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME?  Did you call because you want to have sex?!""

That set her off and thankfully ended all communication.... up until a little over  a year ago.  It's been 5-6 years and were both married now but she messaged me to apologize for how she handled herself.  I said I took it hard and made me say and do stupid things and apologized.  But then she talked about how she thinks about the past and how pure our love was.  I was pretty creeped out and said, ""we're different people now and living completely different lives.  I don't really think about the past anymore and I wish you and your family the best.""

And that was the honest truth.  I'm not bitter, mad, or sad.  I just don't think about the past anymore and I'm very happy with my life and in a loving marriage.  We were both good people, but in the end, we didn't work out because we wanted different things in life.  "

"Courage The Cowardly Dog

This show was ahead of it’s time, it was so obscure for being a “kids” show but the most interesting part is that when I watched it (I was around 7-9 ) I didn’t think it was creepy at all, now that I’m in my mid 20’s I can truly appreciate the darkness of the show and it’s characters

"Not me, but my brother.
So, my parents divorced when I was 12 and my brother was 13. We stayed with our mom and moved to another city with her. She got a young bf (like 15 years younger than her) who also moved in with us. We knew him before and didn't particularly like him, but while I was more or less ""whatever"", my brother REALLY, REALLY hated him. Plus, he was kinda fucked up by having to move to another city, go to another school, where he apparently was bullied, etc. So, he wasn't very mentally stable, to say the least. He would get mad at my mom's new boyfriend and kept saying stuff like ""I'll kill him, I'll kill him...""  
So, my mom went to a psychologist to talk about it, and the psychologist somehow gave her this advice: when my brother says he's going to kill her bf next time, she should just give him a knife and say ""Ok, do it"" and then just leave the house. The idea was that my brother would understand how stupid he was and ""that'll teach him a lesson"".  
So, she did as she was told. Luckily, my brother was smart enough to not actually try to attack her bf or something, but in his eyes it was our mother trying to set him up, so that she could send him away to jail and get rid of him. So, when she came back he calmly informed her that he wanted to go live with our dad. He did it and then didn't talk to my mom for like five years, I think. There was a lot of drama in general. Later they kind of reconciled and they're ok now, but my brother still has some issues and I wonder if they do stem from that time and that particular episode."

"Whether or not sexual assault (and other themes like drug use/addiction of various kinds, abuse, etc) would happen during the game WAS discussed during session 0 and it was agreed that while elements like that were welcome in character backstories, it would not be welcome during play. AT MOST, it would happen between NPCs, get a passing mention to make it clear the kind of people/place/thing we were dealing with, and then we'd move on. That being said, there were no rules at our table that said you had to tell the other players what kind of themes you wanted for your character. Our wizard struck a Faustian deal as a preteen to escape an abusive household, our paladin was on a redemption arc after realizing that the warlord he'd been serving had him slaughtering innocent people rather than enemy armies (there was mindcontrol of some sort involved... my memory is hazy as this was 10 years ago or so), etc. It was a dark world and as a group we were all interested in darker storylines and thematics because we didn't often get to deal with that kind of stuff during other games, which were typically much more standard high fantasy ""adventuring yay!"" type of stories, or stories that don't allow plots to get too in-depth and personal for the individual characters.

&gt;

Our roleplay group once adopted a black dragon hatchling after raiding a cave held by a bunch of Tiamat cultists. We were about to smash the dragon eggs when my paladin brought up the delemma of ""are black dragons evil by nature or by nurture?"" 

The hatchling ended up naming herself ""Vercor Maligent"" and my dork of a clueless Paladin quickly became referred to as ""Bachelor Dad"" as he and the sorcerer tried to parent a cunning little demon of a dragon baby who was already ""too cool"" for both of us. It was brilliant. 

My Palidan also sponsored a goblin work program for a little fellow named ""Snik"" who we ended up capturing a few times. After convincing him he kinda sucked at being a member of a horde my pali paid a retired adventurer to let Snick work on his farm and give him a wage.  Evildoers beware!

"Marinate your chicken in buttermilk + salt + hot sauce of choice, sous vide at 155 degrees, pat dry, dredge (flour + crushed cornflakes + seasoning of your choice), fry at 375 until golden brown.  

Marinating in that mixture keeps the chicken juicy, tenderizes it, and seasons it. Sous Vide allows you to cook the chicken completely and evenly before frying. Shorter frying times means it absorbs less oil so it's less greasy, and the higher temp means it goes crispier. "

"A guy I had been dating for a couple weeks wanted to show me his place after a night out.  It was around 1 in the morning. As we got off the freeway, I noticed that we were driving into an area that looked really sketchy, past old abandoned buildings with broken glass.  I don’t see any homes around.  I was afraid to say anything as I wondered to myself, “How well do I really know this guy?  Am I going to die tonight?”  We finally reach an area with some homes and he realized when we got there that he probably should have warned me about that part of the ride.  We’ve been together for nine years now and married for 4, so it all worked out.  "
"Had an incredibly similar situation happen to me. Walking home from the bus stop in like 2nd grade, some lady I’d never seen before stops and offers me a ride saying she’s my neighbor and knows my mom. I noped the f out of there and into the desert and took the back trail home."

"&gt; Sorry but government subsidized healthcare is just unconstitutional

That's not what those word means, but good on you for trying!

&gt; I should not be obligated to give MY money for YOUR healthcare. It’s not YOUR right for ME to take care of you and to expect I will

See, how this works is like this:

* a small fee (another response gave the numbers for the UK, it's up to $81 if you make up to $5000/month, below that it's less (it's a percentage, of course))

* that money goes for the medical system, with all of its components

* so, regardless if you, or your kid, or your temporarily out of a job brother, or you cousin who's up to her neck in student loan debts uses it - all of the money collected go towards that. So, if you get really sick today (knock on wood, don't wish that on anybody) and can't work for the rest of your life, you're covered by the others, and it evens out because some people need no or very few healthcare (until they do). 

* Shit happens. People that are temporarily out of luck or simply can't afford $20k for a hip replacement surgery because they didn't think they'd need it don't deserve to be penalised for that. Today it's someone else, tomorrow it could be you


And btw, the US has the highest medical costs per capita in the world, and at the same time the average health of the average citizen is below other developed countries. Do you think everything is working ok?

HR mainly exists to mold the ecosystem into having as few problems as possible with as little money, effort, and outrage as possible. So their main directive is to keep things hush."

"Perhaps it’s more to do with the timing and presentation of it all rather than who pays the bill.  Depending on the person and how they say it, I can sort of see how this kind of thing might have different outcomes, including coming across as cheap. It’s all in the wording and when/how the guy brings it up. If it’s something that comes up in a conversation beforehand it’s good to clear things up and for those who prefer equality in a relationship this can weed out those who aren’t a good fit, as long as it’s done in a way where the guy doesn’t sound like a dick. 

For example I went on a date once with a guy(been talking for a while, he asked me out and we went out for coffee) who on the way there threw out something like “just so you know, I don’t pay for dates so don’t expect me to pay for your half”. I’ve never expected a guy to pay for me, for first dates especially I prefer to split the bill, but the way he said it sounded a bit angry and even almost accusatory. Like he was assuming from the beginning that I’m just expecting free stuff? There were a few instances throughout the date where it sounded like he was trying to make sure I don’t get any ideas and the way it was all said felt like I was being talked down to which is not very pleasant to say the least. Overall the impression he gave was of someone who was either cheap, bitter, thinks very little of me or any/all of the above. "

"I was practically paralyzed with anxiety back in 2008-2011.  Expectations were a massive weight on my shoulders, and had me on a path where the past was nothing but regrets and the future was dread, so I spun in place and I floundered.

Key things I've figured out:

The result can't be the focus.  Goals are good, but focusing too much on the end result of X is a recipe for disaster, because it causes things to go tits-up when you don't get the result.  You'll just find yourself rudderless and wholly unequipped when it comes to trying again.  Instead of the result, pay attention to the process of getting what you want.  

For example, if you want a boyfriend, focus on dressing better, becoming an interesting, well rounded person that you yourself are reasonably happy with and that you'd want to date.  Don't get mired in 'I want a boyfriend / I can't get a boyfriend / I suck, I'm a failure'.  Find achievable steps and focus on those steps.  Where focusing on the boyfriend is going to be a whole lot of empty space and question marks with some floundering tries followed by disappointment and feeling like you're back at square one, achievable steps are going to feel good as you accomplish them and give you the grounding to walk away from a failed relationship thinking ""I know how to approach the next one better"" or ""I know what steps to work on now"".  Same for school, work, whatever.

Second thing, motivation doesn't matter.  Discipline does.  In pushing a boulder, the hardest thing is getting that boulder moving in the first place.  It's easiest to summon the strength when the task is new, and once you're doing that thing, keep that boulder rolling.  This is the case in everything from work to school to diets and financial sense- it's easiest to lose weight if you're already on the path of weight loss, easiest to save money if you're already getting a handle on your finances, easiest to go to work if you've gone to work every weekday for the past two years.  Don't let yourself take it easy or say no.  Once you make it discipline and habit, it gives you the momentum to push through the hard days.  If you're leaning on motivation and you have a day that's purely ""I don't feel like doing that"" and you succumb to that sentiment once, it's going to be easier and easier to succumb again.

Generally speaking, as someone who was very similar to what you describe when I was 20 and made all of the wrong decisions until I was 28, I feel that it's very easy to think that people think more about you than they do.  Try to be cognizant of when and where you're putting an imaginary spotlight on yourself.  That's more aimed at strangers.  When it comes to loved ones, in my experience, they just wanted me to be happy.  Some pushback and struggle as I found my own path, but I stuck to it (discipline!), I found my way forward, and they were (with one or two exceptions) a hell of a lot cooler than I thought they'd be."

I freaked the hell out as the knocking continued, but i gathered myself to look out the peep-hole... and i swear, it was there. it was the creature. 

i jumped back in horror right into my roommate. i screamed and she hurriedly tried to calm me down and explain what was happening. the knocking ceased and i told her to look in the peep-hole. she went over and stood there for a bit, turned around and said nothing was there. in my shock and disbelief i ran to the door and looked outside and... 

nothing. not a soul or otherwise was there. 

to this day, i still lose sleep over it."

"It wasn’t funny for me because it happened to me but at the time everyone I told the story to thought it was the funniest shit ever. 

One summer night while I was in high school I went for a night run in my neighborhood since in NC during the day it’s hot as a mofo. I was almost home and maybe another 5 minutes left in my run, got a second wind and starting picking up the pace. I was running against oncoming traffic when I see a car going at a moderate speed not slow but cruising. While they were passing I see a arm come out of the window and a white round object leave their hand. It happened so fast but the object was in slow motion when it smashed into my face. I got egged right in the face..the precision of the throw was spot on. I was so pissed off I sprinted home and got into my car driving around my neighborhood trying to find the car, never did. When I think about it now I laugh and applaud that person with such precision to hit me directly in the face."

"Done that, sort of. I was swing dancing with a friend of a friend, and we had been trying out some new moves all night. We decided to chain them all together into this long sequence, and it went pretty well- until the end.


Just as she went for a dip, I accidentally dropped her on her face. I panicked and tried to catch her, successfully doing so about six inches from the ground- but then I realized that my hand, quite accidentally, ended up rather awkwardly on her chest area. I swear it was like something out of a cliche anime.

I apologized and we pretended that the awkward catch never happened, and it didn't ruin the night, but still. "

"Have a friend who is a tattoo artist. He tells people he'll draw it on with a sharpie and for them to return in a couple days with it still visible as sort of a trial run. If they come back and still have it after a couple days without a black eye, busted lip, or any visible signs they got their ass kicked then he'll do it because they know what they're in for. Anyone that won't walk around with a big swastika in sharpie for couple of days won't be happy with the tattoo and it's likely a spur of the moment joke or stupid decision they're saved from. He said he's only had 1 person take him up on it and they never returned after he sharpie'd it on their chest. "
Usually a human trafficking ring is a *much* bigger deal than just prostitution. 
Thing is he didn't need to do a complete overhaul. His rants and musical videos could be his bread and butter while switching it up occasionally. Sad thing is he used to back in the day but either due to lukewarm receptions or not being routine enough he gave up on it. There's more than one way to be an angry Canadian. His cooking videos and bad head videos were some of my favourites but he never continued those. Also maybe it's just me but the rants were fun to listen to 6 years ago when everyone seemed to be living in bliss and he was the only angry person around (at least in my feeds). Now everyone's angry and cynical and his content just sorta blended in rather than stick out.

Directly outside my bedroom door I saw a girl who appeared to be trying to fashion a weapon out of vacuum cleaner pipe. I groggily asked, ""What's going on?"" My girlfriend replied that there was little time to explain but while I was asleep the night before, the whole unit held up medical and took the red box (medications etc) then barricaded the unit. This meant that there were now either actual cops or screws in riot gear, along with their dogs, lined up outside and about to charge in any minute.

"The scariest thing to me about climate change is how humans knew about it more than 100 years ago, it was measured and understood well by lots of people decades ago, but **still** many people think the whole thing is fake, including all of the political leaders of the USA. 

We, as a global society, are pumping out record amounts of greenhouse gasses even this year. I shake when I think of all the rules passed in the '90s and how many countries have probably just been lying about their emissions ever since then (looking at you Russia, USA, China, Brazil.....everyone....). VW and the car companies are caught lying about car emissions tests to make it look like their cars don't pollute as much as they actually do.

YES to everything you said about climate change being the single biggest threat to the modern world. And YES again because ""we"" know about it and not only are we not doing anything about it, we have leaders who *want to pollute more and more, faster and faster*.

"Well when I was young I thought it was.  Having a hot gf who will be there whenever I want, then meeting another hot girl who I can have on the side, my friends high fived me, and even some of the girls who knew didn’t change how they looked at me.

But then you get older, see how much it hurts the other person whom you care about, and it just doesn’t seem that great.  Plus it’s work to not only hide everything, but keep multiple partners happy.  You’re always on, always double checking your phone, your receipts, your clothes, and at least for me, it wasn’t worth it.

Who is her son. Who had not come out to anyone yet. I just knew, it wasn’t a question to me. But she was not talking about her son and was shocked by the suggestion. Suuuuper awkward!

"[Yes 70% of divorces are initiated by women](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-resilience/201508/women-initiate-divorce-much-more-men-heres-why)

I picked them as a source because I disagree with them.  The authors say that its because marriage is oppressive, whereas non-married relationships (wherein men as just as likely as women to jump ship) are not, and married women are oftentimes dissatisfied while the husband is content.

I disagree to a large degree and think its because theres a bit of an incentive still in the west for women to divorce in that they're virtually guaranteed custody, many states still have alimony, [feminists have fought against removing lifetime alimony](http://floridapolitics.com/archives/206474-womens-rights-groups-host-statewide-media-conference-sb-668) and presumption of shared custody, etc.  Whereas if you arent married then it may be less incentivized.  As a man its still a bit of a risky gamble if youll be able to have a meaningful relationship with your children post divorce so you better settle in.

But yes to answer your question, women file for divorce most of the time and when they outearn their husband they REALLY file."

The ""porn of it"" battle was lost like 20 years ago.  Every cartoon, every show, every game prolly has both porn and fanfiction of it.  Rocket Power porn fan fiction exists.  Calvin and Hobbes porn and fan fiction exists.  Nothing is sacred.  

The idea that any random kids show is going to be immune to this is just unrealistic at best and deluded at worst.  People cross sex and sexuality with ALL of their interests and hobbies.  

As long as it's all fully consensual and kept in clearly controlled areas I don't think there is an issue with that.  If people seek out the porn, that's their choice.  If people find the porn on accident, that should be fixed."

Play Final Fantasy VII
"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem 

I would love to see that game remade because it was so good and *fucked* with your head so much using the sanity meter. For those that haven't played it here are some of things that would happen:

* When entering a room, the character may turn into a Zombie, and ""die"" a moment later or after going through some doors.

* Attempting to cast Recover may cause the character's torso to explode, resulting in a (fake) death of the character.

* When entering a room, the character's limbs may explode in a systematic order, going for the head, the arms and then the torso, resulting in a (fake) death of the character.

* When entering a room, the character may shrink or grow while moving. This is most commonly seen in the strange curved corridors of the Forbidden City.

* When entering a room and when holding a gun, the character can shoot at nothing at random times or turn around and shoot at the camera leaving a fake bullet hole in the screen. (Similiar to the Prologue of the James Bond movies, and in Resident Evil 2.)

* When attempting to reload a gun, it may go off in the character's stomach, resulting in a (fake) death of the character. This is most prominent in Max's chapter, for he is the only one without a bigger gun than his flintlock pistols. Revolvers in other chapters have been known to cause this phenomenon to occur as well.

* When entering a room, the character's head falls off (but can be picked up), and levitates on screen reciting ""HAMLET"".

* The screen goes black, as if the TV went off.

* Bugs may appear to be crawling on the TV screen.

* The game will lower the gameplay volume while displaying a green volume bar, similar to real on-screen TV settings.

* The screen goes black and changes to video mode, and you will hear your character getting eaten until they ""die"". (Even without a ""Break Free"" control stick, the unseen Zombie can still be pushed away)

* A false sneak-preview of a sequel to the game, called ""Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Redemption"" (the original planned sequel to ""Sanity's Requiem"") will appear.

* Upon saving your game, a message will say, ""Are you sure you want to delete all of your Saved Games?"" If you say yes or no, the saved files will be ""deleted"".

* A ""Blue Screen of Death"" will appear.

* You will see the image you see when you start up or reset the game, quoting Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Raven"" in Edward Roivas' voice.

* When the controller is left idle long enough, a still ""screensaver"" shot of Pious will appear on the screen until a button is pressed.

* When you open your inventory screen, all your inventory spaces appear empty.

* When entering a room, the character may be unable to move or attack, and the player will get a fake system message telling that a controller isn't plugged in, while the many zombies attack them.

* A fake screen message will appear, congratulating the player for finishing the demo of the game.

* The camera begins leaning as the Sanity Meter lowers.

There are more of them too, I got these from [here](http://eternaldarkness.wikia.com/wiki/Sanity_Effects) where the full list is. "

Basically me. I started reading them when I was six (and started to *understand them* two or three years later!). That's basically how I (as an American, no less) learned how the English language worked. Language Arts in school was a freaking *joke,* but that might be a story for another thread.

As for depth, it's been 15+ years and it seems like every time I re-read one I find even *more* wordplay and cleverness that I didn't notice before.

If you give someone the power to decide who can and cannot have kids, we will for sure end up having people making it hard for certain social classes, religions, races, political beliefs etc. to have kids. So may as well allow everyone to have kids, but work on a better system to remove kids in harmful environments. "

I was going to reply that there are two different perspectives here. The point she was making was that although men receive far less validation in terms of appearance, women are expected to keep up with their appearance--a lot of our self-worth is tied to that, so if we lose it, we lose that as well. It's just two different sides of the same issue. All in all, societal expectations of the genders sucks and it's hard to break free from that, for men and women."

"Who’s talking about unnatural sounds or wounded dinosaurs? Just let it happen when it feels good.

Honestly I think most straight guys do sex according to porn or what they know they like. Newsflash, porn is made for straight men, and just because you aren’t attracted to guys moaning doesn’t mean girls aren’t. Seems like it should be common sense, but here we are."

""You really just could have had anything, you know. This wasn't a trick. You just had to want it. You just had to be OK with asking for it instead of doing it yourself."" He leans forward to make his point. Even though it's clear he's about to admonish you, he seems more sympathetic than disdainful. ""There is a reason that wishes have this middle step: when you erode the barrier between your imagination and your reality, there is no room for anything new in your world."" 

His gaze leaves yours as he looks up towards the silent sky. 

""So here you have it-- that's your wish-- I'm obligated to grant it, and now anything you can think of is real. Which means you might as well have just stayed in bed daydreaming in your own fantasy world, because that's all any of this really is to you, anymore.""

As he imbues you with your new powers and knowledge, there is no grand uproar, no cosmic chorus playing, and no violent shaking of the earth. Pageantry is for people who are possible to impress, and you've gained a sudden insight into all possible events across all possible universes which makes you immune to amusement.

You look back to the genie with your new understanding, and ask him a question whose answer you already know: ""So I guess there's only one way this ends, right? If I ever want to feel like any of this means anything to me, ever again?""

The genie nods softly and sighs, his eyes betraying an ancient sadness. ""Yup, you make your powers contingent on the wishes of someone who doesn't yet understand, and you hope that they don't make the same mistake we did."""

"&gt; way more people die from alcohol than opiates

This is an abuse of statistics. Alcohol is also consumed by way more people than heroin. Alcohol abuse, which includes but is not limited to addiction, is prevalent in ~10% of adult Americans, although an overwhelming majority have at least tried it once in their lives, and a majority consume alcohol regularly. Compare this to heroin addiction, which strikes about a quarter of people who have ever tried it once. I couldn't find a statistic among ""regular users"", which is likely because a ""regular heroin user"" who is not an addict generally speaking does not exist.

You can die from drinking too much water. You can die from alcohol poisoning. You can die from heroin overdose. Heroin destroys the lives of a far, far higher percentage of people who use it than alcohol does. I can have a glass of wine every day and experience no significant physical or mental withdrawal symptoms if I abruptly stop. The same is not true for someone who does a line of heroin every day. The two are in different classes of drugs for a very good reason."

Sleep minimum 8 hours every night, waking up at the same time every day. Drink lots of water.

Increase your strength in the deadlift, squat, bench press, standing military press and pulldowns/chin ups every week. Seems straightforward but so many fail to track and fall back onto what seems difficult, rather than what is an actual improvement over a previous effort. 

You should be aiming for a 100kg bench press, 160kg squat and 200kg conventional deadlift in the short term. Those numbers are achievable by the vast majority of men in a 2 year period. 

After that, 140kg bench, 200kg squat, 260kg deadlift is a good goal.

To give some perspective at 106kg lean I benched 182.5kg, squatted 252.5kg and deadlifted 290kg for 1RM.

If you want to be big you need to get stronger, I'll say it again because that and adequate food are the keys. Everyone knows it, no-one fucking does it because it is fucking hard work.

"She constantly smoked crack in her bedroom in OUR home. We found needles in her room (she was shooting up heroin) We also found thousands of dollars of stolen goods from a robbery in a town 80 or so kilometers from us that her then drop kick boyfriend committed. We found her diary after we kicked her out that stated she hated me because of the close relationship I had with my boyfriend (her brother) She hated how I was skinnier than her, had nicer hair and clothes, had friends, got a promotion at work, all these random things I had no idea she felt about. She wrote in her diary that she thinks about slicing me, covering herself with my blood and making herself cum. She also admitted to stealing my stuff (ipod, clothes etc.) After kicking her out, her parents gave her another shot and let her live with them again as she had nowhere to go since boyfriend went to jail. Their house ended up being raided for the stolen goods from a tip off that I got blamed for by the father (my ex- FIL) in the end. A few weeks later, she breaks into our house while my boyfriend is at work and beats the shit out of me while I slept while she was high on crack. She got one of her junkie mates to come into my workplace and threaten me with a bomb on my car a few days later. I finally lost it and went to the police. Ex-FIL finds out and went ballistic. Told me I was a grassed out pig and a snake etc. Literally like 2 days later, SIL comes to my workplace and overdoses in the toilets on heroin. Ex-FIL blames me for the stress that I have caused her because I went to the police about the threats and assault. He gave an ultimatum to my boyfriend (now ex), me or his family. He chose them. 4.5 years down the gutter. She showed a whole new level of jealousy I never knew someone could feel.  Anyways 2 years later, I get an official apology off ex-FIL and ex-boyfriend. It didn't mean shit to me though. They said she still hasn't changed and causes all sorts of trouble for anyone that gets involved with the family (e.g. other siblings partners or friends etc.) She nearly stripped me of my sanity. This all happened in a period of about 4 months when she lived with us after getting kicked out of her parents house. At the start, I felt sorry for her. I thought we were friends then she just switched and thought I was always out to get her and ruin the relationship between her and her brother (this was told to me from one of their other siblings) "

"I was in London, working for a large hedge fund and we had the TV on during a quiet lunchtime. 

Then we saw the first plane...

We all saw that. The whole world saw the same. We couldn’t make sense of it and we speculated about an accident and then the second plane hit.

The difference for me versus most people watching the TV was that we had speaker boxes from the brokers at Cantor Fitzgerald in the World Trade Center. We heard the panic, the screaming, the crying and then the silence. 

My close friend working for Cantor in Paris wasn’t cut off. He heard everything. The sheer terror, the confusion and the desperation and the messages to loved ones and colleagues. And the death. 

We all lost friends, or were at least one degree of separation away from someone who died. In most cases many of our friends died.

Some of us accidentally made money that day. We happened to have the trades in our portfolios that benefitted from death. They were investments made prior to the event. It was an awful feeling.  No one wanted to profit from this. The market ethics dictated that we all close every trade as soon as the market opened. This was not a time for capitalism. This was a time for solidarity.

Some people did react immediately and made huge trades betting on falling markets and interest cuts. Anyone and everyone who did so regretted it. They were trained by years of trading news flow to act first, think later. Usually it paid off, sometimes not, but this time no one wished they had listened to their reactions, Everyone knew it was wrong.

I happened to have a portfolio that was enormously profitable on the day. The markets were closed and there was no chance to close out without booking the largest profitable few days of my career (the markets were closed for several days). That was the worse money I ever made. Worst than the biggest loss.  It felt like blood money... but accidentally so. I didn’t trade on the news... I didn’t try to capitalise on death. It just happened by chance. It was sickening. That feeling doesn’t go away.

The trading floor during the strikes was silent. It was shocked to the core. We all knew that nothing would be the same again, and what we saw and what we heard could never be erased from our minds.

That day I’ll never forget, it was the day the innocence of the American dream died,"

Additionally, your use of methinks made me curious enough to look it up in the dictionary. It comes from *thyncth*, a word related to, but distinct from *think*, meaning ""it seems"". So it came from the Old English ""mē thyncth"" and would translate as ""to me it seems"".

Eventually i notice the little room i'm in has a slight odour, whatever I've got the door closed.

Fast forward to 11pm when my wife comes home and the moment she opens the door i hear ""what the hell is that smell!?!?!?"", apparently the entire house smelt extremely strongly of stinky blue cheese.

"If the body is in a casket, the casket has to be sealed with specifically-positioned holes (to ensure it sinks). If the body is not in a casket, it needs to be secured to enough weight (like wrapped in heavy chains) to ""sink rapidly"" and stay sunk.  Then you have to submit notification. So if any random body does accidentally float back up, they know who has been buried in the vicinity. 

Of course, that doesn't always [go smoothly](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39192386/ns/us_news-weird_news/t/sea-burial-botched-mans-body-resurfaces/), and then the body is identified and rhe family has to not only mourn the loss of their loved one, but now they have to re-bury the waterlogged, decomposing, probably partially eaten corpse of their loved one.

"Your credit score looks at your overall credit situation; it's not limited to any one card (or loan, or other credit line). It looks at the ratio between credit you're using and credit you *could* be using, but are not (unutilized credit). The more unutilized credit you have, the lower utilized credit ratio, and the better off you are. It shows both that other companies trust you with a lot of credit, and that you yourself know how to handle it.

Another important factor in this equation is the average age of your credit accounts. You should definitely keep your established $6500 card, but applying for a new one will cut your average account age in half (assuming you only currently have the one card). If you're thinking of taking out a loan soon, be aware that having new cards can negatively impact your credit score. Of course, having lots of old cards will help you in the long run, and old cards gotta be new sometime, so maybe apply for a new credit card or two when you don't plan on getting any loans. Oh, and getting a credit increase on an old card does not affect average account age.

Thus, the best option for you would be either to increase the limit on your one card, or else keep that card and apply for an additional one (even if you don't use it). As long as you aren't paying annual fees, there is no penalty to having multiple cards (except the average account age one I outlined above)."
"I don’t know that I have a favourite language per se, but rather there are features of languages that really fascinate me. Once you get out of European languages that people are familiar with, languages differ so much, and in ways that I actually don’t even know how to describe to non-linguists.

What I think is most interesting is that minority languages (and languages of ‘primitive’ people generally) tend to be so complex that they make your head spin. People denigrate minority languages as though they’re ‘just dialects’, when the reality is they are so rich and complex that they make English, French etc. look like ‘Me Tarzan, you Jane’ moron speech of knuckle dragging cave dwellers (The only code the Americans used during WW2 that the Japanese never broke was Navajo)."

He threatened to kick my mom and myself out of the hospital room when we told my sister that we would support her no matter what decision she made. He had pressured her into that decision before they even knew how bad it was. I've always thought how lucky he is that he got just what he wanted, to not have a child with special needs and multiple physical medical conditions.

\- Don't be too eager to start; good foreplay makes the rest of it way better. If you don't end up lasting as long as you thought, good enough foreplay will make up for it.

\- If she goes on top, keep note of the rhythm. When it's your turn to take control, use that rhythm as it's probably her preferred.

\- One finger is all you need when you're fingering. Face your palm upward and move your finger in a ""come here"" gesture, rubbing her ""roof"" in a repeating motion. Speed is not gonna get you/her there, the right amount of pressure and rhythm will. 

\- If you need a second to cool down because you're running low on mojo, stop and take a minute to just kiss/make out and grab one another. Wild making out in the middle of sex can be the best way to enjoy each other and buy yourself some time.

"I think you have a good point and 90% agree. But I wanted to plays devils advocate to try and point out another perspective rather than just agree with you and move on.

Society has moved on at a rate almost inconceivable to our ancestors. The last 200 years since the industrial revolution has been like going through the Bronze Age and Stone Age in a matter of decades. The world in 1600 would of been similar enough to someone born in 1640. Now somebody born in 1960 had a completely different life to someone born in the year 2000.

As an example from my own life me and my sister would from about the age of 10 virtually look after ourselves. We got the bus home from school and cooked dinner. Not every night all the time but regularly enough. My dad worked night shifts and my Mam 2 jobs so they did the best they could. But this would now be considered child abuse. My sister wouldn’t allow her own 10 year old to be home alone and especially not cooking food.

But this was 1990 not some mythical ancient past. Our expectations just keep moving on so rapidly and we don’t seem to recognise we lose beneficial things along the way. Those experiences forced me to learn life skills that few 10 year olds now would get the chance to learn. Early on I realised you had to look after yourself.

Now I don’t blame kids for the upbringings they had. But I think it’s perfectly reasonable to look at the evidence and see kids are growing up slower and slower. For some childhood seems to extend into their mid 20,’s. Is it not understandable why older people might resent this? People older than me would laugh at my upbringing as soft and easy. Compared to theirs they are likely right. 

I think we may have gone too far with the super focus on children. But the people to blame aren’t the bloody kids. It’s the people who raised them and the media that shaped that upbringing. "
"I once dated this person who goes by the name of ItsMrMackeyMkay - a little weird I know - but they were charming and lovable. They had over _300_ comment karma on reddit! But I'm sure you already know that.

I will always cherish the time we spent together, but I'm a bit happier now with someone who has under 100 total karma. Life is good."

"Paul.

I used to work closing shift in a backwoods town that had been long-forgotten after most of the industry/factory work had moved overseas. The only people left were a slowly-dwindling population of retirees who had managed to buy houses and secure pensions in the 'good ol days' and everyone else too poor and jobless to afford to leave. 

That general poverty-stricken population provided a lot of the 'color' in my Gamestop career, but this isn't about them. This is about Paul. 

Paul was a retired software engineer from one of the big companies that was part of the exodus. An old-school punch-card guy that managed to grab on to this whole computers business and get dragged along for the ride when this shit was basically magic made of logic gates. He was there to witness the birth of arcade and video games in the 70's, and he thought it was *glorious*.

But, like I said, this was a place that had been long-forgotten and left in the dust. And so was Paul. He was never married, no kids to speak of. He had a nephew, but that nephew had moved a few states away, so he didn't come through or call often these days. Sometimes even Paul forgot about Paul. Age had made his memory rather slippery, so things sometimes fell through the cracks a bit. Nothing major, just the little stuff. He wrote himself notes on little post-its to help with the remembering. 

I know all of this now. I didn't know it then. My first encounter was sometime during the summer of 2010, I think. 

Somehow, Paul found the number to the local Gamestop. He must have found it while he had been looking for some place to purchase or play those arcade games of yesterday that he remembered so fondly. I think the first time I spoke to him he was looking for an Atari. He called literal minutes before close on a Sunday, just as I was dragging out the vacuum, and my coworker hot-potatoed the phone into my hand and ran off so that he didn't have to be caught up on the call. 

""Thank you for calling Gamestop, where you can buy two used games and get one free! This is Jane, what can I do for you? ... Oh, no, sorry, we really only carry modern systems, nothing that's been out of production for that long.""

Usually calls like that are quick, you just direct people to ebay and other collector's sites and that's that. But Paul didn't have the internet at his house. Back in the day he was racing in the bleeding edge of technology, but he wasn't as young as he used to be and was outpaced. He had trouble keeping up with those sorts of things now. But back in the day, little miss, let me tell you...

And so that conversation went, winding and rambling and doubling-back, for about a half hour. My customer-service-approved attempts to wrap up and end the call with this stranger missed their mark; I was pinned to the conversation by politeness. 

I ended up cradling the phone on my shoulder and letting him talk while I cleaned. And as it went on, it became more and more clear that he hadn't actually had a chance to speak to another human being in quite some time. I was suddenly rather glad I hadn't managed to hang up on him earlier. He was never unpleasant, but I could still hear a marked improvement on his demeanor by the end of our chat when we said our goodbyes. 

Apparently Paul called back again a few days later to inquire about the ""nice young lady who helped me the other day"" because he couldn't remember my name. The folks working weren't privy to my long phone call, but I was the only lady employed in the district, so it wasn't hard to figure out who he meant. We got kudos for positive mentions on customer feedback surveys, so they happily told him. 

And that's how a sticky note on Paul's phone table came to be that said ""ATARI [gamestop phone#] JANE ^VERY ^NICE "".

After that, he called every day, sometimes multiple times, asking for me. I was dodging the phone and debating calling the police to see what you can do to stop an old guy from trying to talk to you about space invaders. Not much is cringier than an octogenarian stalker. 

There's a better ending, though. 

At some point a coworker picked up a Paul Call and just straight up scolded him for harassing me. Apparently, Paul was horrified with his own behavior and nearly in tears. He was having trouble remembering when it was he called last/if he had called at all. He'd just spot his sticky and remember he wanted to talk to me. He promised he was so sorry and didn't want to be a bother and he'd throw the sticky out right now and never pester me again. 

""Wait! Don't throw it out yet. Hold on a second, okay? Just stay right there, I'm going to put you on hold but I'll be back in a minute.""

And then I was fetched by this coworker for an impromptu meeting. We thought Paul was genuine, he was always polite and never pushy when someone said I wasn't there, so his story made some sense, and by now everyone knew I had chatted with him because he was lonely that one time. So what if we just put Paul on a schedule? If he at least mostly adhered to it, problem solved and we didn't have to break an old man's heart. If not, he was probably in a state where someone needed to do a wellness check on him. So it was decided. Paul was allowed to call on Sundays at closing time. 

We hopped back on the line and told Paul his new rules, which he was perfectly thrilled with. The post-it was amended to  ""ATARI [gamestop phone#] JANE ^VERY ^NICE ~~call~~ CALL SUNDAYONLY 9pm"". 

He did stick to Sundays, and we chatted nearly every week, although sometimes other coworkers would talk to him instead. I heard a lot of the same stories over and over, especially on his ""bad days"", but he was always polite and pleasant and I enjoyed his company while I vacuumed. I'd say we were friends. 

 At some point he must have smudged his note, though, because I became ""Janet"" instead of ""Jane"".

But Ted Lavender, who was scared, carried 34 rounds when he was shot and killed outside Than Khe, and he went down under an exceptional burden, more than 20 pounds of ammunition, plus the flak jacket and helmet and rations and water and toilet paper and tranquilizers and all the rest, plus the unweighed fear. He was dead weight. There was no twitching or flopping. Kiowa, who saw it happen, said it was like watching a rock fall, or a big sandbag or something—just boom, then down—not like the movies where the dead guy rolls around and does fancy spins and goes ass over teakettle—not like that, Kiowa said, the poor bastard just flat-fuck fell. Boom. Down. Nothing else."

"I've never blown up at anyone in my life, except for a select few times at family members when I was a kid. Never gotten in more than a mild argument, never fought. Everyone basically knows me as the relaxed, easy-going friend who avoids confrontation.

But damn if I'm not fucking angry all the time, I just don't show it when anyone's around. The littlest thing will set me into a screaming rage if I'm in my car alone for example. I badly hurt my hand punching walls more than once because I was just so fucking furious about some annoyance or other that I was seeing black and red. I'm in an almost constant state of stress and anger but I've spent twenty years mastering the art of never showing it to anyone else. It wasn't until recently that it occurred to me that that's probably not normal or healthy."

"On the other side of this - had an ex tell me that he wasn’t going to “fight” for me or plead with me to stay together. I wasn’t actually breaking up with him. I got a job offer back in his home country (Wales, we were in England - not that dramatic) and I sat down and had a conversation with him about how Wales is so far away from where we lived and how I was at a loss for what to do because the last thing I want to do is to uproot him too. He responded with “you fooled me for 4 years, I thought you weren’t like other girls with your game playing. No. I’m not fighting for you. You make your own mind up. We’re over.” Literally within 10 minutes of me telling him about this job offer he left the house. 

And no - there’s no weird shit about his home. He goes back frequently with his new girlfriend and last I heard they bought a house together in his old home town and we used to go all the time to see him parents. 

I mean bullet dodged but sheesh. Apparently having a discussion about the future with a guy you’ve been with for 4 years was too much for him.  I’m just glad I didn’t chase after him. "

"I had a weird family friend who was watching us and took pictures of us naked on my parent's bed. I actually don't think she meant anything by it, because she framed it for my parents. At the time my youngest sister would've been 3. Okay, I don't really think naked pictures of toddlers is necessary, but plenty of people do it, without any malicious intent so it's not that weird. My sister and I were also in the picture. I was 9, she was 7. I actually took the photo from their room and hid it. The same family friend showed up to my grad party and had that same damned picture. When she left, I threw it out. My mother admitted that she didn't like having the picture around, and she thought it was weird taking a picture of me and my older younger sister naked.

In short, I don't judge parents that take bath time/ naked pictures, but given that experience and not to mention how many creeps turned out to be in my family, that is something I won't be doing when I have kids, let alone putting anything super personal about them on social media."

"Opening up to people is a hard thing. I can readily count 3 people who I could trust and one other who I can talk to. I was too introverted and shy to make friends in college so at that point, only one of those 4 people were in the same  college with me and I felt toxic clinging to him.

I realized he can only help me so far in life as we were different majors and the junior classes were taking a toll on me. I made up my mind to talk to classmates in a study area of the engineering building. It was one of the best decisions I've made. We hit it off and I made friends with his friends. He was such a friendly person that he could rope in anyone to talk. He took a semester off to work on a co-op/internship but because of his help, I was easily more interactable (I dunno if this is the right word). Senior year was a blast partially due to him and my senior design team's Chief and my structures lead. They don't really know it, but I'm highly grateful to them. 

Sadly, after graduation I regressed. I was unemployed and had to move back to my home country (I studied abroad). I kept in touch but sparingly with them. I had lost some of my confidence during my self-isolation. I didn't  want to spend my parents money hence I hadn't gone out with friends, much less other people. 

It wasn't till I found a job that I regained some of my confidence. I'm almost 10 months into this job and have become less unapproachable with every passing month. I'm glad the friends I mentioned in the first paragraph stuck through with me during my low days.

In these past few months, I've found that I could talk with more people more easily. I was always too proper and too square with unfamiliar people. This one I have to attribute to one particular person. She has brought the most change in my confidence that 3 years of working as a teaching-assistant (encountering hundreds of people) hadn't (not that I don't appreciate the job, it was great). She was a great friend and I started seeing her differently. At first I was worried that it was because I hadn't had such a close female friend before. In the past few months I had been pondering on if it was because I was feeling lonely but I've determined finally that I really did like her and not just her company. Sadly, no happy ending here but that's life.

I've no clue where I'm going with this. I'm probably just venting my past week's emotion and maybe hope that you get some inspiration or epiphany from it. Don't worry about feeling lost and alone. Everyone feels that way, it's just how we go move on and not let it sink us. Lastly, just because they don't see you as a friend, doesn't mean you can't treat them as friends. If they don't reciprocate, it's fine, you either try harder or move on. Some friendships take a few little years to start and some takes 5 minutes. It's how long and how well they last that matters.

So, fight on good stranger!

"I would have to politely disagree with your last point there, even in light of all the ""Step 1: Be Attractive"" stuff that's spewed out below your comment. 

If someone is truly exhibiting behavior that's deemed to be stalker-like, or threatening, etc... it doesn't matter how good the person looks. You could be hot as hell, but people are still going to be turned off by that, if not downright fearful about it (understandably). I'll take it a step further (and liberally generalize), but most of the users on reddit are men (myself included). While general appearance matters, it typically matters  *less* to women. They're more interested in someone who carries themselves confidently, are polite to others, and can hold a conversation. Hell, maybe not even all of that - really just qualities that make you an attractive partner. Being physically attractive can help, but it's really not a be-all, end-all. Ladies reading this - please let me know if I'm off-base here, but I think I kinda (maybe?) have this figured out a little bit. Men on the other hand? I would generalize that they'd be more willing to overlook emotional flaws in a woman that is super attractive, at least for longer than women would men. 

The more people buy into the ""Attractiveness is Everything"" mantra, the more they find it acceptable to not work on bettering themselves - which is the *actual* reason women don't find them attractive. "

"I know why you fell through your sisters bedroom ceiling when you were supposed to be at school. (We found my dad's old air pistol in the attic but it had no pellets so me and my freind used match heads instead, he shot me and I lost my balance and fell through the ceiling.  We cleared off but forgot to close a skylight. When I returned home from 'school' the police were there, they thought someone had climbed in through the skylight, lost their footing and fallen through the ceiling). Got away with that one, I also managed to land on my sister's bed which was nice."
"I used to nanny for affluent families and I can attest to this. The preteen girls I nannied had never been to a public school, so they’ve literally never been exposed for long periods of time to peers who were not affluent.  They used to mock me for everything, from the car I drove (a basic sedan), to the shoes/clothes I wore.  They defined who I was by what I had, and saw it as a character flaw that I was poor.  They always had the newest and best of everything. For example, they made fun of my iPhone 4s a few weeks after the 5 came out because they all had it and I was outdated. It was stuff like that which just made me feel small and worthless, even though I was 19-20 at the time and knew better. I can only imagine what this does to the psyche of someone their own age who is just trying to fit in. 

The worst part is that their mothers would make excuses for them or teach them these behaviors. For example, they made fun of my boyfriend’s car once in front of her, and the mother simply said “girls that’s why you fall in love not just with your heart, but with your mind too.”  "

IMDb was founded in 1990.
"India. Nuff said.

There was a squat latrine in someone's home we were visiting. They weren't that wealthy (solidly middle class, typical home) , so I guess we can't judge too much.

The interior had roaches crawling around when I walked in, and other questionable tropical insects hangin' around the walls.

The squatty toilet thing itself had been lined with feces from god knows how long back, as it was dry and matted. There was other feces and stuff on the walls behind the latrine.

The ""floor"" (I guess) was covered in water and was moist, and I could feel some things while I walking on it.

A rusty tap and an equally dirty bucket were what we had to use to ""clean up"".

The soap had some mold growing on it.

We were gong to head home on a flight back to the US after visiting these people, so I decided to hold it in for another 3 hours before we made it to the airport, where I kid you not, they had the most fancy toilets known to man anywhere. It was a glistening bidet toilet, and was cleaned almost every hour by staff. The lighting in the restroom was almost heavenly.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost cried from relief when I saw the airport toilets.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: As advice if you are used to more quality restrooms and in no way can handle typical Indian toilets, I suggest you all to book a western Hotel wherever you can. In the end, losing that money was worth it when it came to taking a dump in peace."
"I'm pretty late to the party in this one. But, I thought I would add my stories anyway. 

I had a really bad dream once. I dreamt that I was on an operating table. The room around me was bright white. It might have just been bright lights but I don't remember seeing any walls, the whole room was just a really bright white. I remember there were several of these tall, and dark figures. They looked like shadows, I couldnt make out any features other than that they had glowing, and bright red eyes. They tried to cut open the side of my stomach, and it hurt really bad and I remember waking up screaming. My headphones were stabbing my side, ans that was the pain I was feeling. Still checked myself for scars though. No scarring or anything.

One last short story. I have a younger brother, we are 2 years apart. Everyone tells us we look like twins, but I don't see it. Anyway, sometimes when I'm thinking of a song. Like, not humming, or whistling, literally just in my head. My brother will start whistling the same tune i'm thinking of. Still freaks me out a little when he does it."

"The problem in my experience is usually not that people joke about rape, it's that the people who like to joke about rape make sure that the victim is always the butt of the joke. Wanda Sykes has a bit about leaving her pussy at home when she goes jogging that's hilarious and inspired no protests or boycotts, because she's making fun of the predators instead of the prey. It's not that people can't handle jokes about serious topics, it's that it's cheap and mean and not funny to pile on rape survivors. 

Also, on the off chance you're one of those dudes who wonders why you can't find women to game with you, it's this. This is why. I'm adjusting fine in current society because I don't hang out with people who think it's more important to be edgy than it is to be kind.

And if they care about balance of races, then the warforged need a complete rework before initial release, otherwise they will be hilariously overpowered."

"This happened to me, actually.

&amp;#x200B;

So i was sitting in my room minding my own business when the genie came and announced that i get infinite wishes since nowadays everybody wishes for those immediately anyways.

I started off with some little manipulations here and there, but one of the first orders of business was immortality (of course).

I made sure to include footnotes for when my whole body gets obliterated / i become insane or what have you.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i'm not ashamed to admit that i then spent a few hundred years (roughly) indulging in all sorts of pleasures, although i'd rather not recount the extremes to which i went once i was stuffed on the more sane practices.

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself the curious type, so once i was thoroughly bored of pleasure i ventured to explore the moon (which is quite underwhelming if i'm being honest), but before i could get any further, i figured i'd explore human knowledge first.

&amp;#x200B;

After streaming the content of every book ever written into my brain, i asked myself: why not go further? Why not every book that WILL every be written too? And alien knowledge?

After a brief moment i realized what i actually was going towards, so i made what i thougt to be my last wish:

""I wish to become god.""

&amp;#x200B;

It was the worst decision i have ever made.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, god isn't some sort of ethereal ghost, looking at the world from above the clouds.

God is everything.

Every human, every animal, the sky, the planets, the stars, the unknows universe and nothing at all.

God is limitless.

But because god is everything, god is also just one - and i never expected it to be so lonely.

A being without limits lacks limitation, and with it, meaning - there was nothing i didn't know, nothing i hadn't felt and no secret left to discover.

&amp;#x200B;

Realizing the mistake i made, now not needing the power of the genie, i went all the way back.

I made myself into the tiny aspect of god who was me before, sitting in my room all these years ago, staring at the genie that had just appeared out of thin air.

I remembered what would happen, but i can't say that i comprehend what i would become in the least.

But what i did unterstand was the utter terror of the path that was just being offered to me.

Now you might guess what my first wish was:

""Go away and never come back."""

"I was running a game for a new player and his girlfriend. We were all friends and the girlfriend was *very* excited to play. She used to be into RPGs and had never tried D&amp;D.

As everyone knows, DnD is in part about overcoming obstacles. It's not always rainbows and sunshine. This is important.

So we're 90% of the way through the dungeon (I was running Sunless Citadel from TftYP) and they attempt to take a break inside the dungeon. Most players will tell you that this is *usually* a bad idea - you're *in the enemy's base and you're trying to take a nap* for Pete's sake.

So I tell them ""OK we're going to roll for a random encounter. If you roll a 3 or lower something will find you."" I had intended to actually make the game *easier* on them by having one of the Big Bad Evil Guy's assistants, who is normally a part of *that* fight, break off and find them (an easy win for them) - making the final fight easier.

So the Boyfriend raises his hand all excitedly and wants to make the roll. We let him and yup... he rolls a 1.

This is where it all breaks down. He says, and I quote: ""I don't think *we're* ever going to play a game like this again."" after getting the bad roll.

Cue a complete breakdown of the game, I try to bring him around that it's not that big a deal and sometimes the dice are mean to you but it's nothing to get upset about and how they should be fine - the girlfriend starts crying because this guy is being a terrible sport and is trying to dictate what *she's* allowed to do or find fun. We break up the game to avoid any further unpleasantness and they escape to their room (we were travelling together) and a fight ensues where she's basically berating him about being a poor sport and how he's not allowed to tell her what she wants to do etc...

We all made up, there were no hard feelings or anything - but wow. That was *uncomfortable* for me as the GM, especially because I'm usually bending over backwards so my players will have more fun. The guy apologized and the rest of the trip went well, but we haven't hung out like we used to since that moment happened. I lost some respect for him because of his bad 'sportsmanship' and I think he felt ashamed because of it all. We see each other frequently enough but don't bother making plans anymore, just the four of us.

This guy was what... 26? *26!*"

"The double action means that pulling the trigger causes two actions to happen: it both cocks and releases the hammer to cause the firing pin to strike the primer. Some firearms are ""double action only"" and you cannot manually cock the hammer.

In a single action only pistol, pulling the trigger can only release the hammer, and it must be cocked manually. 

Then there are ""double-single"" semi-automatics where you can use the first trigger pull to cock the hammer and release it, and for each subsequent round the slide pushes the hammer back (cocking it) and then chambers another round for you as it returns to its closed position. 

There are also hammerless revolvers and semi-automatic pistols (where the hammer is not exposed externally) double action only and striker-fired pistols wherein you have a striker (a firing pin that is directly spring loaded) that strikes the primer and fires the round.

"Well to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Skippy peanut butter. The flavor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of peanut products most of the flavors will go over a typical consumer’s head. There’s also the brand’s negative attitude towards other peanut butter varieties, which is deftly woven into its image- Skippy’s advertising draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of peanut butter, to realise that it’s not just a sandwich topping- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Skippy truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the light brown color of Skippy,  which itself is a cryptic reference to the shells of the very peanuts which are used to make it. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hormel’s genius concoction unfolds itself on their lunches.

"So, this happened to me a just a few months ago.

I work approximately one mile from home and usually walk my way back, making my arrival time quite predictable. Given that, my mom usually changes the TV to the building´s cctv channel and waits for me to appear on the frame so that she can leave the door unlocked. 

This day I was returning home from my part time job at midday, got into the elevator, pressed the button as usual. Nothing new. *Just before* I arrived upon my floor and the elevator door opened I could hear an apartment door shutting and (nervously) locking, probably mine. I thought it was weird, since she should know it was me, but gave no attention to that. Walk my way to the front of the door, knock on it and get no answer. Mmm... Knock on it again. This time I could hear footsteps moving *away* from the door and my mom´s kinda worried/angry voice saying ""What are you doing, son? Why do you keeping doing this?"" (I have a habit of jumpscaring her by knocking on the door and hiding). I knock on it a third time, now worried, saying loud and clear it was me and that she had no reason to feak out. She opens the door really upset and asks me ""Why did you knock on the door *twice* and did not show up? Anyway, did you use the stairs? I could not see you on the cameras"". I explain what had just happened and now we are both in awe and feeling the same ""heavy"" vibe.

She swears to this day that she heard knocks on the door, opened it and there was nobody. Twice. Then she locked it. Five seconds passed by and then I *actually* arrived. According to her, that´s why she kept quiet the first time I knocked.

pf: the building isn´t known for weird stuff like ghosts or anything, so it was pretty unexpected.

"Just to kick things off...

I wrote a series of 10 secret admirer letters to a girl that I had barely talked to in class. I said some way over-the-top shit about how amazing she was.

In the last letter I said that I would ask her out the following day after of course telling her that she embodied the perfect woman in Proverbs 31. You know, totally normal shit for someone you've only said hi to.

I found a letter on her desk marked ""secret admirer"" the following day when I was supposed to ask her out. A logical person would have thought that this was a letter to me, but I thought that it was another male rival in the class trying my super awesome strategy. I tossed the letter behind the bookcase.

After class I asked her out and she replied with, ""did you read my letter? You probably should."" I went back in the middle of a period that wasn't even mine and fished it out from behind the bookcase with a yardstick. My science teacher looked at me like I had seven heads because he was in the middle of teaching. He was a good sport about the whole thing though.

Basically, the letter said the only man she was interested in that time was Jesus and that while my feelings were very nice she just wasn't ready for something like that. We were both 13. So, you know... Fun times. It was probably the most embarrassed I would be that year.

Fun fact: she now works at a fundamentalist Christian publishing firm and I'm a teacher in a *gasp* public school (our middle school was private Christian).

TL;DR... I wrote a series of 10 secret admirer letters over the course of a month. Chick said she only spread for The Lord."

"As a penis-wielding individual, sometimes it gets really difficult to basically be doing push-ups while focusing on pleasuring your partner, focusing on your own pleasure, and making noise. I usually make noise for my partner until I am close to orgasm, and then get rather quiet in comparison for a minute or two while I focus on what I am feeling, but get very vocal at climax (I force that for my partners). If I try and focus on 4-5 things at once, I am going to spend the entire night close to orgasm, but never getting there.

And most of my partners either don't like being on top, or are really bad at it (ever think your penis just broke when 130 lbs comes slamming down onto it pubic-bone first?)"
"I haven't really had the chance to try it with anyone else as I'm kind of terminally single ATM but I realized fairly recently it feels so much better if you make noise during, even if you're making noise on purpose and not involuntarily, you notice the pleasure more and the afterglow is so much better."

He definitely thought I’d like what he liked. I couldn’t tell him differently, either. He said all other girls got off that way. As if I give a fuck about their orgasms?

NO. I should’ve known right then and there that he’d never be able to see anything but through his own likes and dislikes. 

Also they had to be faking those orgasms. His tongue was one type of too much pressure, he didn’t like to move his tongue much at all, the noises were off putting, the eye contact annoying and he absolutely refused to use his hands to help me out.

But the lady was like 70ish. Later, she puts her arm around my waist again and said ""Tell me about your job. How is it going?"" Later, I was trying to grab my purse off the top of the cooler (like think tall cooler), and as I was reaching for it, this other lady, I'd guess in her 50s, does that weird tickle rub thing on both sides of my waist again. I didn't say anything, because I didn't want to make a scene, but  what the hell? Why on earth would you think that's acceptable to do? And I thought for a minute maybe it'd be acceptable if I were a kid, but then I thought, no, I'd be pissed and weirded out if they did that to me as  a 10 year old. Maybe this is the problem.

"Not long after reading the story ‘the goat man’ I was walking home at about 12 midnight after a few at the pub. Then just as i was in sight of home, a loud heavy panting noise started and it felt like it was right next to me.. on my heels.. i silently panic and cant bring myself to look behind because it was dark and i didn’t want to see what it was, the noise changed to a grunting and moaning panting noise. I sped up and jogged down my drive way and into the front door out of breath and scared shitless. 
I get home and my granny is awake, she doesn’t sleep much, she asked me whats wrong and i said i heard something outside.

"My sister has the same insecurity. We can't even FaceTime with each other if she's not wearing makeup (and if she's not, she'll ""wear"" one of the filters that covers her face). I rarely ever wear makeup and I can't help but wonder if she's judging me for my appearance, but I don't think she does... Her thoughts are only ever on her own appearance."

"Actually I’d love if someone described mine as pretty standard. Would ease my insecurities about them.  

‘They’re amazing, they’re so hot’ my brain goes hmmmm but are they??? ‘They’re pretty standard ‘ my brain hears well that seems genuine, yay I’m normal!"
Wtf? Kinda gross to refer to any choice made by a human who is fighting for her life as well as dealing with the after effects of a devastating surgery and course of treatment as “nasty”.  
I don’t think he meant that his crush herself was exhibiting he insecurity. He just pointed out that some folks are insecure and that he personally knows himself to find scars attractive and gave some proof. 
I think that those things aren't gonna be amongst the most common insecurities for women because women are generally taught that the only thing that matters is how they look and as long as you're pretty you'll be fine. Women worry about their looks because we're taught in the world that this is basically where all of our value comes from

"And outside of the government, people try to paint it like it is social justice warriors versus neo-Nazis, but it feels like if you don't intentionally seek out fringe left-wingers, you never encounter them, let alone in positions of power. Meanwhile, you have the right-wing having serious trouble unilaterally condemning the murder of an innocent woman by a neo-Nazi that was sanctioned by the organizer of the protest.

You have people like Dave Rubin championing this ""moderates are dead"" stuff, but then they spend all their time interviewing legitimately fringe figures like Lauren Southern and agreeing with everything they say.

It feels like the world's gone crazy, not because moderates are dead, but because people's perceptions of moderation are entirely divorced from reality."

So I've got a fair number of dressy clothes because I'd look insane if I wore my 'wedding guest' dress to work or a nice dinner out.

"Went on a dinner date with a dude. He wanted to take me to a place that had a reputation for having the best hot wings around. 

“Sure, but I’m not getting the wings. Trust me.”
“Why not? Do you not like chicken wings?”
“Oh, no, I do. That’s not a side of me I should really bring out on the second date, though.“
“Oh please, it’ll be fine!”
“It probably won’t, but if you insist.”

I think he just thought I was being a bashful lady about it. I was not. I eat hot wings like a fucking starved wolf. Perfectly capable of being polite with any other food, but not with wings. I take no prisoners. No words will be spoken and you will watch me pick every bone clean, crack it in half, and suck out the marrow until my plate is empty or I just can’t anymore. It WILL be uncomfortable. I DID warn you.

He didn’t call me back after that date. 

I went on a date to the same place with a different dude a good while later. Gave him the same warning, he also assured me it was fine. Once again I snarled over my plate of hot wings until it was a plate of bone shrapnel and nothing else and, when I looked up, he was *staring* at me. But not in horror. No, he had the exact reverent mouth-slightly-open-in-awe expression you see when the wedding photographer snaps a picture of the groom seeing his bride in her big white dress for the first time.  We dated for a LONG time. He was good people.

I guess the moral of the story is that I need to find some picture of Marilyn Monroe and superimpose “If you can’t handle me at my hot wingiest, you don’t deserve me at my Michelin-star French Bistro-est” and put that on my dating profile or something."

Oh yeah new clothing nowadays is total shit and really poor quality.
"My focus is usually ""don't cum yet its only been 4 minutes."""
"I grew up on a farm and we were poor, which I have zero issue with and never did. I just got used to not spending a ton of money on new clothes, especially since used clothing was so much more affordable. I also had hand-me-downs from my older sister which were awesome. I’m just really down-to-earth and practical and I hate the thought of working so many hours just to spend it on clothing when I could literally get amazing clothes in great condition secondhand for a fraction of the price. And new clothes to me are like new cars - you buy them and they’re instantly used anyway so what difference does it make?

Also I had some self-esteem issues in the past when I was a bit younger. I survived a traumatic experience which left me with a lot of ugly scars so it was always a struggle for me after that to feel ok with my body or even look at it. I wore a bathing suit in 2001 on a vacation - it was literally last year before I got the nerve to wear one again. I tried to buy one in the meantime but ended up crying in the dressing room and not buying it when I saw myself in it. Hell I haven’t even worn shorts really since then - I bought a pair of capris last year and feel pretty naked wearing them. But thanks to my amazing SO I’m comfortable with my body now. But I digress.

Anyway, I don’t really like peopling either if I can help it lol. The mall is loud and annoying with tons of people in it, and I don’t like having to deal with waiting in long lines and crowds of people. By far the best part of any mall is if they have an Auntie Anne’s pretzel place and they give me a free sample before I buy one 😂

I love yard sales because for 50 cents I can buy a pair of jeans or heels that are beautiful and in good shape. Amazing “fancy” shirts to wear to work, or awesome band tees that someone doesn’t want anymore but I sure do! The clothing I get the most compliments on is the stuff I get at yard sales. I love telling people where I got stuff because it’s fun to tell them I spent a dollar on something they probably paid $35 for in a store somewhere. And hell I prefer spending money on things like vacations or a new drum set 😁 Plus you meet some of the coolest, most unique people at yard sales! I love antiques and unique things and being able to shoot the shit with the person selling it, just having that no pressure conversation about where it came from and how old it is and that their great-grandmother made it by hand - the stories are great. By contrast one time I was at the mall buying a Christmas present and the gal behind the counter literally yelled at me because I didn’t want to give her my email address to sign up for their newsletter and wouldn’t ring me up until I did - although I told her to go fuck herself and take my money so she eventually did lol. Closest I’ve come to wanting to punch someone in a retail store 😅.

Oh and I used to work retail and buying new things like clothing just makes me feel like I’m probably being fucked over with the markups. It’s like when I decide to indulge in a lotto ticket and end up losing anyway - I just feel dumb for getting sucked into it. Idk how much the markup is on clothes but at $80 for a pair of jeans those people can go fuck themselves right in the ear 🍻"

She wasn't single, she was married and what she wanted was for me to have sex with her while her husband watches and masturbates. Right then her husband stepped out of the next room.

Anyways she died 2 years ago from today from eating something in our backyard, and we were all so heartbroken at the time. Of course, in my head I was always thinking “at least she died doing what she loved, eating” but I couldn’t say it out loud because my mom was really upset over the death. 

Literally 3 months ago I said that out loud to my family and they all started laughing and we brought up stories of how fat she was. She was a good dog though. :) "
"I like to think that that's more of an American school district thing, but I'm sure it's not.

"Not the commenter you're asking but as a 5'3 woman I dated a guy who was 5'6"". I was really into him but he never let an opportunity to bring up ""woe is me for my height"" pass. I never brought it up, thought he was extremely sexy and told him so. Not to mention, he was always tall to me! But he'd still go on rants about how being a short guy is soooo terrible. After a while it's less selfdeprecating jokes and more just an annoying whiny victim complex.

Currently with a guy who is only 5'3. He works out, has excelled professionally and socially, and I've never once heard him talk about his height. The only time might've been when we attended a wedding together and took pics where I was in heels slightly taller than him, and even then it was brought up by someone else. Height literally does not factor into our relationship at all, let alone how he views his place in the world. 

I have honestly no preference, but I'd be wary to date other ""short"" guys because of dude #1's shitty attitude.

Edit to clarify: I'd be wary to date guys who constantly define themselves by their height, unprompted, hence the quotation marks. Not wary to be with guys who happen to be short!"
"Story from my tattoo artist (and I’ve seen a picture to confirm) was that a female tattoo artist was at a convention and had been really itching to tattoo a self-portrait . . . of her vagina . . . on someone else. And this one dude said sure and let her tattoo it between his balls and his asshole. Apparently he was on all fours for a while so she could do her best vagina portrait. And by golly, she nailed it.

"I (female) am a ballroom dance instructor, and was participating with students in a studio showcase. My partner (male) had a few different students in the show, one did 2 routines. The routines were difficult: multiple lifts and stunts so she (his student) was in the air and otherwise in peril most of the time. 

She perfectly completed her routines only to improperly curtsy at the end, thus dislocating her knee, and then her shoulder when she fell. It made me laugh very innapropriately while waiting for the paramedics. 

It was the only injury in the entire history of both that studio and my old partner's or my dance careers."

"Pop punk has actually had an insane resurgence over the last 5-7 years or so. It doesn't have the benefit of MTV and radio play anymore but shows for lots of lesser known pop punk bands sell out sizable venues all the time now. Just a handful of bands who have been carrying the pop punk banner strong:

The Wonder Years, Neck Deep, Set Your Goals, The Front Bottoms, Man Overboard, Real Friends, Modern Baseball, Heartsounds, ROAM, Knucklepuck, State Champs, In Her Own Words, The Dangerous Summer, Forever Starts Today, and the list goes on and on. 

Hell, Newfound Glory still tours, the original Taking Back Sunday lineup got back together and played a reunion tour of their best album in 2013, then released a new album in 2016; Sum 41 got the original lineup back together and toured and now continue to tour regularly (minus the original drummer). 

Even better is that a lot of pop punk bands actually write *good* songs with meaning and substance now, too. There's never been a better time to be a fan of the genre. "

"I was a lot like you. I hate to be cliche but life is cliche. It gets better. Part of your problem is your overthinking. Your insecurities are being projected and picked up by the women you are seeing. My suggestion to you is to try and meet a somewhat older woman. I think someone with some wisdom on her will recognize the good things you have to offer and will not be bothered about all the negatives you mentioned. This will give you a chance to gain some experience yourself and allow you to let go of the negatives that are holding you back.  Like I said, I was a lot like you and it took a long time to get past it. casual sex was not my thing, but once I was able to get in a stable relationship with a woman who could see past the shyness on insecurities, I was able to shed them. Just don't be like me and struggle till your 35. "

"I asked an artist to tattoo U34093 on my lower lip.  It was while he already had ink and needles out for a larger piece I'd gotten and took all of 5 minutes to do so it's not like I was wasting his time, but he was very hesitant.  Gave me the whole spiel on how lip tattoos never stay, you shouldn't get meaningless numbers/phrases, etc.  

I explained to him that it was the same tattoo my horse had (thoroughbred racing horses have registration numbers tattooed on their lips) and while I'd thought about other placement, it could be misconstrued as something relating to the Holocaust and I wasn't trying to be offensive, as it was just a memorial that helped me feel closer to her after she passed.  Also told him if he went deep enough, it'd stay just fine, and I was aware it would be uncomfortable.  

Still took a stupid amount of time to convince him and he was dismissive and flippant about it, but it's been 4 years since I got it and it's still perfectly legible and I love it.  My favorite tattoo by far. "

In generally, if you have split ends or damage, it’s time for a trim. Tbh, if you have long hair, I recommend just going to a women’s salon, no shame. You can get deep-conditioning treatments for like $20 and I swear they’re magical. [some examples of split ends/unhealthy hair types](https://i2.wp.com/www.longnigerianhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/split-ends-types-chart-hair-damage-repair-1-e1526403427919.jpg?fit=500%2C420). 

You usually don’t have to worry about totally frying your hair unless you use bleach or heating products (flat iron, blow dryer, etc.). Invest in some heat protectant if you ever do heat style your hair. &amp; if you don’t use conditioner in the shower, starting is a great idea.

"&gt; You have 40 years to have a job/career. Don’t get in a hurry. 

False. What you do in your 20s MATTERS. That's ten years of building skills, accruing seniority, accruing pay raises, and saving money that you are missing out on by drifting around and doing bullshit jobs. 

Compound interest is a motherfucker. The people who have prosperous lives at 40 didn't walk into it at age 39. They built it by advancing in their career over the past 20 years. You don't just decide ""okay, grownup job time"" in your mid-30s and walk into an office and start making $70k a year. 

Success breeds success. Failure breeds failure. If you aren't working at and succeeding in a career by your 30s, that happy prosperous live with an advanced-stage career at age 40 *is not going to happen*.

This guy wants his whole head colored white to “make his dad happy.” Okay kinda weird. During the tattoo the guy getting the penis tattoo pinches his nipples and whispers “I’m daddy’s little princess.” Okay so all of that over, here comes the weirder part. Comes back like 10 minutes after the tattoo is done and gives the guy a Crunchbar to add to his tip. That bar is nailed to the wall in memory. "
"So typically with fandoms, there's always that one fan-favorite character. That character is commonly shipped with the most conventionally attractive character closest to them. For the film The Lorax, that character was the Onceler. More specifically, younger, pre-corruption, looks-like-he-shops-and/or-works-at-Hot-Topic Onceler.

However, with the Onceler there was no conventionally attractive character to ship him with. Fandom was reluctant to ship him with the Lorax aka Danny Devito's fursona, and the only other characters of importance in the movie are kids, the Onceler's family, the boy's grandma, or that one douchebag mayor. So fandom came upon the unorthodox solution of essentially doubling him and shipping his pre-corruption!self with his greedy!self.

[This post can further explain what the actual fuck happened with the Onceler fandom.](http://madredhattie.tumblr.com/post/110111848841/what-was-the-onceler-fandom)"

They travel and read and keep up with technology. They’ll most likely be around to meet my kid(s) if I ever have any.

My dad, on the other hand, was always an old guy. He played with me and my brother sometimes, but he mostly wanted to sit around and watch TV. He didn’t like to travel too far from home, and he was always asking me to show him how to do things on his phone, the same few things every time. He died almost a year ago at 60.

"Our Tiefling rogue offered certain... Services to a rich halfling in exchange for a bed for the party for a night as we'd just accidentally spent all our gold buying everyone in the pub drinks. 

His plan was to paralyse the halfling with some grease that our half orc has (it started as a joke but then the DM rolled stats for it as a weapon/ointment/we're not quite sure). It had paralysed a Tiefling earlier in the night but entirely failed to have any effect on the halfling. 

After our poor Tiefling noped and danced out of the room (literally), the halfling followed him and this resulted in what can only be described as Benny Hill as performed by lubed up Danny Devito. 

TL;DR Male Tiefling's failed attempt at prostitution results in him being chased round and round a mansion by a tiny, naked, greased up halfling. "

"Not that I’m endorsing his in any way, but based on my experience (research scientist in an industrial biotech lab), he probably was right. A BSA solution does not technically have to be made in a salt buffer, but it usually is for most common applications. And a glycerol solution would taste sweet (I’ve never tried it personally but it’s supposed to).

The funny thing about this is that there’s a much easier way to figure out which solution he used, something which most wet lab personnel will be familiar with. A protein containing buffer like a BSA solution will form foamy bubbles (similar to milk froth) when shaken in the bottle, whereas glycerol will not (unless the glycerol had also been supplemented with a protein, which probably isn’t the case). 

And depending on the concentration of the glycerol stock, it might be viscous enough to tell it apart from the BSA solution by seeing how the liquid moved when the container was inverted."

"The student went out for his first ride-along a day or two into the internship (which was supposed to be for a whole semester).

Officer comes back to the vehicle and sees the information pulled up. He looks at the student, shakes his head, lets the vehicle go, and drives right back to the station. Student was ""fired"" right then and there. We all got to hear about it by the end of the week because this was literally how our program worked. 7 semesters of regular classes and the 8th semester is spent out on internship. It was a huge deal because he was the first person in 20 some year history of the program to ever be dismissed from his internship like that. He got off light because the department decided not to charge him with unlawful use of a department computer system, but the college was so embarrassed that they expelled him from the program. They used him as the example of ""what not to do on your internship"" for the rest of my time there and I would imagine still to this day."

"At a big box grocery store chain, we had quite a few actually.

One was that one of the night crew guys (whom I never liked. He always asked to cash his $600 check right when I clocked in before I could set anything up or count money.) had apparently gotten so drunk on the job that he had to be wheeled out on a dolly. Apparently another coworker had also gotten drunk with him (though tried to put the blame on this guy) and drove him to fast food. The really drunk guy jumped out of the moving car and allegedly yelled “I’m gonna go back to (store) and fuck shit up!!”

Another case is I guy in the meat department I briefly worked with, but transferred to another location. According to the article I read, he and his coworker had been drinking in a park and my ex-coworker strangled him to death. His claim is that the guy was “making homosexual advances towards him” but in California you can’t use that as a defense anymore."

"I was in a shipyard, and we had shipyard workers and navy workers all working in the same ship. When the new navy crew would come on board, they'd complain because the shipyard workers would leave all their garbage in the navy garbage cans so the navy people would have to take care of it. So one crazy sailor came up with the idea that we should hide the garbage cans, supposedly forcing the shipyard workers to deal with their own garbage themselves. That struck me as being nuts, because I figured if they didn't have anywhere to put their garbage, they'd just leave it lying around, which would be even worse. But holy cow if it didn't actually work! We hid the garbage cans, and when we came back the next day, the shipyard workers had gotten rid of their own garbage. I couldn't believe it worked."

I was meeting some relatives in India and was spending my last day in Mumbai before heading to South India. My aunt told me to go to this place called the Elephanta Caves and look at all of the rock carvings over there. I was totally on board with that and bought my tickets. But there was a twist to this- India was about to embrace its monsoon season. The temperature would always be in the late 90s and early 100s, and even the shade couldn't save you. The only thing to save you was water. Immediately before I left I got three water bottles. I finished one on the walk to the dock and bought a jumbo sized bottle from a small stand on the island. But I didn't know that there was another threat to me- monkeys. There were \*\*hundreds\*\* of them on this island, and the government couldn't do anything about it (monkeys are sacred in Indian culture, so killing one is considered sacreligious). I was walking around the caves, boiling in the hot sun. My water bottles were finished, and I was halfway through my jumbo bottle. I took it out for a swig when I noticed a monkey eyeing me. His beady eyes looked greedily at the bottles, his legs were coiled and ready to bounce. I stood guard, closed my bottle, and backed a few steps. The monkey steadily crawled a few steps forward. I was starting to inch my way backward when the monkey hissed and started charging toward me. Without hesitation I threw my bottle at it and ran away. I looked around while running to see the monkey take the bottle and rip it open. That clever bastard stole my water bottle and caused me to drop out of my tour so I wouldn't die. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Indian monkeys are great at scaring you into giving them your water bottle. "

And then flat out telling me to deal with school issues if they came up(include stupid paperwork that obviously isn't the job of an 8 year old) because I have to learn at some point. Made me grow up way too quickly, and I'd end up having long conversations with adults instead of people my own age.

When my marks weren't perfect 100%(I had really high marks) or I was moody, I was verbally bombarded with yelling. On 1-3 occasions(I don't remember the number anyway thank goodness), I was slapped across the face because spanking had long ago fallen out of favor in the household.

End result was a mature and overly cynical person with little respect for their parents. Luckily, I did end up as a fairly responsible person and I humor them since they let me live out home and paid for schooling. But it took years to learn how to express myself properly and learn proper social skills, and I also am in the habit of rejecting help since I have a ""do it myself/ my way or the highway"" attitude that persists.

I'm sad by how it worked out. They clearly care, but they aren't the best at the parenting thing despite having wanted and planned for kids. We weren't accidents. They defend themselves by saying certain things never happened or by saying that I turned out fine, ends justify the means. I'd like to do better when I have kids."

I also found out that her ""asshole boyfriend"" before me wasn't a saint, but was also generally dealing with her being untrustworthy and getting way too close to all of her guy friends, which is why he was always paranoid and didn't trust her.  By the time our relationship ended, I was just the next ""paranoid, controlling asshole boyfriend"" in her list.

I wish there were more movies that addressed these sort of things so I might have had my eyes more open to it.  ""Take This Waltz"" is one of those kinds of movies to some degree."

"Do you enjoy and get invested in works of fiction, like movies or books or TV shows?

"&gt; Are we not making them feel welcome in largely male spaces, or do women just have different tastes than men?

Little of column A, little of column B. I know lots of women metalheads, for example, that don't like going to shows because getting groped in a crowded press of bodies in front of the stage is upsetting to them. So they'll only go if they have a boyfriend/group of friends around them to shield them. I would say metal probably attracts more male fans because the bands are mostly guys trying to be hypermasculine and aggressive (at least for more mainstream subgenres like thrash), and that kind of stuff can be off-putting to people, especially women. 

So I think that plenty of girls are into these things, but the public spaces for them have either been traditionally male-dominated or are de facto male-dominated by the fact that they're not perceived as welcoming to women. "

"Just because they're codependent, slightly more nuanced that a 90s cartoon or DC pring runs, or can be ""kind of sweet"" sometimes doesn't mean a relationship's healthy or even just the minimim standard of not abusive. Because abusive telationships aren't all abuse all the time.

 Abusers and victims *do* see themselves as loving their partners in their own ways. It's a large part of why victims stay and why abusers so refuse to recognize their own abuse. Abusers think they eould never hurt the one they love without provocation (shiftjng blame to their victim) and victims don't want to sèe that the one they love as hurting them without good reason, so it must be their fault.

Harley &amp; J in suicide squad are just as toxic as any other iteration we see but by being less overtly physical and letting them show that they love each other, allows people to ignore the abuse, normalize and romanticize abusive patterns, and signal to viewers in abusive situations that they won't be believed either if their abuser has ever been outwardly nice to them.

Alternatively, they could use a rechargeable battery (but then you have to remember to charge the battery on a weekly to monthly basics), or a more easily changed battery (but then the product probably has to be bigger to support a more robust battery connection and keep the delicate electronics away from static and clumsy people)."

An unidentified man was found dead at 6:30 am, 1 December 1948, on Somerton beach, Glenelg, just south of Adelaide, South Australia. The case is named after the Persian phrase tamám shud, meaning ""ended"" or ""finished"", printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the fob pocket of the man's trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, authored by 12th-century poet Omar Khayyám. The case had a number of unusual details like the fact that all his clothing labels had been removed."
"Don't worry, I'm fluent in idiot logic, I think I can explain: if a person's overweight, it means that they have flabs, and similarly ""loose"" pieces of skin/fat on their body. (I assume that's more or less why the term ""tight body"" exists) From there it's not much of a leap to say that if the rest of the body is ""loose"" their vaginas must be as well.

Of course the whole thing is utterly ridiculous, but I do think that was the logic behind it

EDIT: Somehow instead of explain I wrote escape, so I fixed that."

"My dads good friend is a rodeo clown. He does the show and works the barrel he is pushing 60. When there is a lull in the action the clowns are there to entertain and keep the ""show"" part of the rodeo going.

"Post below that gives sources mentions:

"In (what I think would translate to) middle school I was hugely into chess so I joined the chess club.

"French people don't hate Americans; furthermore, your entire country exists only because you were the enemy of their enemy (Great Britain) and your Revolution was heavily funded and aided by the French (and to a lesser extent their cousins, the Spanish).

And btw, the retreating thing is mostly Americans who, on average, are pretty ignorant about any history besides the names of their presidents and stuff like that. Most countries with decent education where WWI is taught (no idea if it's taught in Japan, for instance) know the French fought relatively well and not only stopped the Germans when it was needed (First Battle of the Marne), but kept the front steady for a few years until enough reinforcements arrived to override the Germans (which they tried multiple times, resulting in heavy losses on both sides)."

"I've wondered about that too. Obviously rape is one of the most horrible things a person can live through, but nobody lives through murder. Maybe that's why we see it that way--we live alongside rape victims who struggle all their lives to heal from their trauma, but murder victims are, by definition, not around anymore.

I also suspect it has something to do with dumb patriarchy shit, like overvaluing a woman's ""purity"" and/or virginity. Like, if I'm only as worthy as I am unspoiled, what's the point of living once I've been raped? I'm ruined now.*

"Super late to this one and haven't had many scary encounters in my life. Back when I was maybe 18 or so at my old home I grew up in I was laying in bed with some ear buds in watching YouTube or something. It was like 10 or 11 at night so everyone was for sure sleeping in my house but through my earbuds I could hear a whisper and it made me all chilly and I sat straight up in my bed and paused my video. And then I heard it again kind of sounding like it was coming from the side of my room where the window to the front yard is and it was very very clearly my name. I didn't even look over just sat there starting to tear up I was so scared and after a few seconds of nothing it happens again sounding like it's right from my closet about 2 feet from the foot of my bed.

This is also close to the door to the hallway so at that point I was just hoping I was disoriented and somebody just needed me and was trying not to be loud. Scared out of my mind I just say ""Mom?"" and immediately after I hear my name again but it's more forced and the first part my name is being hissed like Sssss and it's obviously my closet. I then lost my mind and was like ""What, what do you want"" etc and it had stopped, I reached up and yanked my light cord and got the courage to open my closet and nothing, but damn it scared me straight. Never had anything like that happen before or after."

We're about to close and have stopped seating tables. I'm wiping down the menus and finishing my side work so I can get ready to collect my tips and go home. Suddenly this absolutely massive, probably 50s woman waddles aggressively over to the host stand. I'm standing there, bracing myself for the verbal deluge of which I'm expecting to be on the receiving end. This woman raises her voice at me and DEMANDS to know why 43 cents were added to her bill for the RoundUpForCharity thing. I am dumbfounded, and immediately jump to the classic ""Oh my. Unfortunately that's not something I can help you with. May I get my manager for you?"" I grab Gio, my manager (and a really great guy) from the kitchen, and tell him to brace himself. This woman goes on a tirade, absolutely losing her mind. Some notable quotes include ""I pay my taxes and give THOUSANDS of dollars to charity each year"", and ""MY money shouldn't go towards the RESTAURANT getting credit for giving to charity"". Reminder this is over less than half a dollar. At this point her waitress is on the verge of tears, and Gio offers to give her 43 cents in change. She yells at him and DEMANDS that the charge be cancelled so the restaurant doesnt get credit for her charity, and the money be put back on her card. This goes on for 20 minutes after our official close time (though there are still tables, as per usual), and I'm stuck there the entire time. I was and still honestly am most baffled by the fact that a woman//landwhale that gives ""thousands of dollars to charity"" couldn't stand to give 43 cents by accident. Top tier cheap cuntiness all around."

"I would have let the real natural reaction play out.

“Oh no. Oh my god. You miss the jump entirely and fall to your death. You’re dead. I’m so sorry but you are dead.”

I would even act like I’m thinking about how I could make them not dead, and be sad to have to do it. Then after the group freaks out and that player is gutted:

“Wait! You hear muffled screaming from under the player. The other players run over and flip the player’s body over and there’s an old man with all his bones broken, yelling at you to watch where you’re going. He reverses his Petrify spell on the player, uses his wand to mend his bones, and walks away, lecturing your party about manners.”

I try to never make my players feel like I am giving them slack or ignoring rolls. When I make strong arbitrary choices, they just think it was all part of the plan and they can still suspend disbelief and trust me to DM well."

"Accents can ruin a game faster than just about anything. 

I have a story. We were playing a new game with our fairly normal group. One of our friends invited his wife and let’s just say, no one fucking likes that annoying bitch. She’s literally the worst person ever. So we got attacked by a swarm of rats and she had cast burning hands on the swarm, and my buddy and I on the frontline. Luckily I was a desert wind sword sage so I was able to shrug off some of the damage. My buddy was dropped. I got him back up and he picked up a dead rat and threw it at the sorcerer(horrible person). She proceeded to go on a 45 minute rant about how we were terrible people and my buddy Justin should be kicked from the group. To which I said ‘why would we kick the person we actually like?’ This lead to another hour of shrill argument and her husband had to quit the group. Was awful. "

"I kind of spoke about this on a previous D&amp;D thread, but let me tell you about the DM I had back in high school.

Goth kid. Very serious about everything. One hell of a storyteller, though, and he wrote some really awesome campaigns that he was more than willing to run for anyone who was interested. D&amp;D was like the one thing in the world that he seemed to have fun with, the only drawback being that he was *very serious about* ***everything***.

So, he decided to run a game for my group of friends: him as the DM, me, my best friend, his best friend, and this quiet, nerdy guy who kind of lingered in our periphery. I was a gnoll sorcerer (which... has become my thing anymore, as impractical as it is), my best friend was an elf ranger, his best friend was a shade rogue, and the quiet one kept having to be walked through rolling a character and kind of sat on the sidelines.

It starts out fine. We're all having fun. Me and his best friend are a little more into it than the others, but not obnoxiously so. We banter during dice rolls and make jokes and actually *roleplay* in an RPG. However, as time goes on, it becomes increasingly obvious that the DM is getting sick of us.

He's sighing. He's rolling his eyes. He makes jabs about how shades aren't supposed to be talkative and that my character was useless. Subtle jabs, but jabs.

Then, in the middle of the first big dungeon we were doing, he just kind of throws up his hands and decides he's done with us. On the fly, he creates a menacing boss monster for us to fight in hopes of killing mine and his best friend's characters... in the form of a souped-up cockroach on the floor of the castle hallway. He gave it insane stats that were so high that you'd have to roll near-perfect to damage it and just grumbles under his breath the entire time we're fighting it.

Which we do. It was my first D&amp;D campaign so I didn't even *realize* it was meant to kill us at first, and his best friend was just incredibly angry and wanted to win out of spite. He kept trying to call the DM out on his shit, which was always rephrased back at him in a way to indicate it was all his fault. Somehow, through some grace of some divine god of luck, we manage to crush the goddamn thing... at the cost of our elf ranger who had been the DM's ""model player"" the entire time (she didn't really say anything aside from what was necessary and therefore didn't ""detract"" from his plot).

We were half dead when we won, decided how to split the loot, and then called it a game. His friend decided to stick around with us while the DM stormed home angrily.

The session after this, the shy guy finally finished his character and was ready to join. He made it as far as handing his character sheet to the DM for approval when the DM looked at us and his friend, said he wasn't going to play with us anymore, and shoved the paper back in the shy guy's hands and... left. He just showed up to tell the quiet dude to fuck off, and *left*.

So, yeah. Being penalized for roleplaying in a table top RPG while the DM and his best friend exchange angry barbs during a boss fight created out of spite, eventually cumulating in crushing the spirit of a kid who just wanted to be our friend was *pretty damn awkward*.

**TL;DR: DM is a dick who didn't like players talking to one another.**"

"It's OK to embarrass yourself and make mistakes, that's exactly how you learn.

When I moved to France, as an English speaker I couldn't hear the vowel sound that is somewhere between e and u, but not quite either, and it took me awhile to learn when to use it and when not to use it. I learned this the hard way when I found out that instead of saying ""Merci beaucoup!"" (""Thanks a lot!"") I had been saying ""Merci, beau cul!"" (""Thanks, nice ass!"") to everyone for WEEKS and no one told me because they thought it was hilarious. The difference between ""beaucoup"" and ""beau cul"" is literally just making the ""oo"" (coup) sound versus making that ""eu"" (cul) sound. Was I mortified? Absolutely, but you bet your beau cul I never made that mistake again.

You hate it in the meanwhile, but you learn so much more in the long run by just saying ""screw it"" and trying new words and phrases even if they're far from perfect at the start. Just know you'll get there eventually. You can laugh nervously about your horrible accent/grammar when you first started out a bit more lightheartedly once you're fluent than if you focused on it then. After all, if you are reluctant to speak because you know your accent sucks or you use verb tenses improperly, it's going to take you so much longer to fix those exact problems you're insecure about."

So I'm wandering through their using my phone light when I see a guy in a tree. He's literally just standing on a branch watching me. Suddenly this motherfucker just drops down at least 12 feet and does like a roll right onto the highway. Here's where my adrenaline really kicked it into overdrive, because I just started running like a motherfucker. I left this crazy dude in the dust. I think he kept with me for maybe 5 minutes before I lost him, but there was no way he was catching me. I kept running and running for maybe 20 minutes, got to my door, threw it open, slammed it, locked it, and passed out on the floor. Never walking that way at night again."

"Your opinion is anatomically incorrect. Lack of orgasm doesn't mean lack of arousal. I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaginas and women work. Vaginas aren't penises. 

It's possible to be out of your mind with arousal and still have difficulty orgasming because maybe you're tired, perhaps you don't feel well, possibly the position is making it difficult, you're overheated, or ya know, bodies are weird and can throw curve balls. 

Just like loudness of moaning doesn't denote pleasure, the amount of vaginal lubricant is not indicative of arousal, etc. It's not a black and white thing.

"I am very attracted to tall women. Also to short women. I like women in the middle too.

What I've noticed is that guys who won't date tall women are highly insecure and concerned what others think about them. They wouldn't want anything making them look small as they are very invested in their image. 

Same as women who won't date shorter men, it's all based on an unhealthy obsession with their 'image', which for both is more important than who you actually are

Why you'd want to date an insecure narcissist who is so terrified what others think about them, I don't know.

He would ask questions, and I'd answer them to the best of my knowledge about myself and I would be soaking wet knowing he wanted to eagerly try to follow or experiment with my replies, and just plain listen to what I wanted in the moment.

Unfortunately we ended up not lasting in a relationship or hooking up, but what a ride. He definitely opened the door to something I didn't know about myself, seeing as I was usually the debilitatingly shy one in any relationship until I hit about 31. I'd like to think that he helped me out of my shell, and I helped him. I hope someone he trusts came along and rocked his world, and he theirs. "

The random Jynx, Skarmory and Tauros don't really make up for it and I wouldn't use them in my team so I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to *actually* play Pokemon Go (without spending money) since I don't really want a horde of rats and pidgeons "

"I've been a freelance Illustrator for years and have had very few instances like this (thankfully). I attribute this to a few things. Most of the ""exposure"" stories you see on reddit are from amatures who:

1. Don't value their time and charge way under any livable wage. (If you don't value your time why would anyone else?)

And

2. Don't act professional and argue with potential clients. (Seriously, if you're accepting commissions, don't argue with clients. That makes you both look like assholes, even if they deserve it.)

If you take your work seriously it goes a long way to avoiding bad clients.

"I don't know how popular it is outside of high school book lists but reading [Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichmann_in_Jerusalem), by Hannah Arendt, really stuck with me. It concerns the trial of Otto Adolf Eichmen, a Nazi SS who was in charge of the logistics of transporting Jews to ghettos and concentration camps. In his view he did nothing wrong because he was simply following orders, abiding by his duty, and following the letter of the law. 

The narrative really prompts you to take a hard look around yourself and consider that evil doesn't necessarily have to be an active force or acting outside of the framework of society. Sometimes evil is just a person's lack of care, or their desire to continue to promote a system simply because it is law as written, or it is how it has always been done."

It was awful depressing and they were genuinely worried about being the next Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor. "

I was out in the open and didn't see the guy anymore, so I relaxed. Then after some minutes I saw him standing in some bushes much closer and staring at me. Fucking creepy."

A drunk dude in Amsterdam casually ripped the fucking kick-stand off of a random bike. He did it in stride and threatened the owner of the cafe we were at with it and also threw a few pitchers of beer around.

At one point he tried to grab a glass bottle from my family's table but my mom just said ""no, no, we don't do that at the table"" in a calm voice and ripped the bottle out of his hand.

He fucked off and we had a nice lunch after that.  Great city, 10/10 would go again."

"It depends on how you like to sleep, your budget, and if you sleep with a partner. I'm a stomach sleeper so I need a firm spring coil mattress. Memory foam is better for back sleepers. Now they also have hybrid and latex mattresses which are in-between spring coil and memory foam. There are also certain brands that make mattresses for couples like [Helix](http://www.helixsleep.com) which can put a completely different bed firmness and feel on each side of the bed. Before you buy any mattress, **DO YOUR RESEARCH AND TEST.** Don't be afraid to go to mattress stores and feel different ones. What one person might think is the best mattress, another might hate. Also, know that buying a mattress online is far cheaper for value as they don't need to pay for a storefront or salespeople but also know most mattress stores can negotiate prices on the spot and if buying from a store, you can test it first, so there are good and bad to both sides. There's a lot to learn. I only know all this because I just started doing research myself after suffering with back pain for years. I can post some of the links I found if you're interested.

That is Batman. That is the superhero who inspired me.

Close second is Geoff Johns’ Batman in JL comics, who strikes a good balance of “grim PTSD Batman” of the modern era and “motivated, caring BTAS Batman.”

Johns’ Batman makes a speech to Lex Luthor about how he became Batman to help himself and his hanguls, but the very first night he went out, it stopped being about himself and it became about everyone else, and I think that was a great line and a great melding of the two characterizations."

"Following their ""passion"" instead of their aptitude.  The number of people I see living miserable lives because they are trying to make a living doing what they are passionate about instead of what they are good at is staggering.  I understand that singing might be your passion, but you can't sing.  Trying to build your life around something you aren't good at is a recipe for misery.  Instead, identify the things you are good at, match them with a need that others have, and go to work.  You will be happier and find more meaning in your life if you go that route. Then you can pursue your passion on your personal time."
That means a diss
"I actually tried to do a report on starving kids in the US when I was in highschool.
Couldn’t find a single case of death caused by malnutrition, Maybe it’s different in other developed countries but I’d doubt that it’s as rampant as you make it seem to be. "

"This. A good zoo almost always has animals live long, happy lives. Some animals struggle heavily in captivity - Slow Lorises, Pandas, Sand Cats. Others thrive, like Lions, Horses, Rabbits. Just like some people are going to do better in nature and will struggle to feel good. Others thrive in modern society.

This is just hokey bullshit evolutionary psychology. You're unhappy because you're a caged animal! ... Or maybe more people are depressed and struggling to survive. I'm sure people felt this way seeing a neighboring peasant have a bumper harvest when they didn't. We're just connected now and we can see those thoughts that resonate most."
"It was when I was little so I don’t know much about this one, but my uncle had problems with his wife/soon to be ex wife and the police. So he decided for himself that have the wife, daughter, or himself in the world was better then being alone. So he decided to kill his daughter who was only 3 or 4 and then his wife and then suicide by police. 

The even crazier thing is my other uncle his brother decided to do an almost similar thing not to long ago. He waited at the child’s daycare for her to be dropped off and jumped in the mothers car with a shotgun, thankfully the mother pushed the daughter out and the daycare workers took the child quickly. Then he drove his self and ex wife to a road and had a stand off with police for maybe 30 mins to an hour before killing himself and the mother. 

Having that history in my family makes me worry about how people look at my family not associated with them. Thankfully I have a different last name so my children don’t have to worry about it but the history is there so I worry at times."

"Ok I think your generation has been brought up valuing post secondary education too much.  The government doesn't need to spend billions of dollars educating people in interests instead of workable fields.  100 kids graduate from a physics program and 2 get a relevant job and we're still telling kids they need STEM jobs or office jobs or they're wasting their time.

Trades generally pay better are generally easier to get into at the moment and are much more needed then 10 million more unemployed graduates from liberal arts, poly sci, chemistry, etc.

I'm not saying there isn't work for some STEM fields, but it's almost entirely programming and computer work. 

It may be crappy, but the government (and through them taxpayers) can't affoes to freely educate everyone in what interests them.  The options are encourage people to learn fields that are in demand or to just let people take anything they want on loans.  The loans method may seem nice, but it means go he got billions in unpaid loans given to now unemployed people that are pushed into poverty because their costly education was in a field that is full up."

"Credit unions are owned by their members, where say each dollar is a share and total accounts is total shares. Other times having an account itself equals one share, putting everyone on equal footing no matter how big their savings. Thus, you want to make your shareholders happy so they remain invested shareholders.

Banks might be private institutions owned by a single person or few people, or might be a publicly-traded company where you buy shares in the stock market. Having even a million-dollar account there gives you no voting rights or ownership; it might give you a bit on unofficial leeway but no direct power, because you're not a shareholder unless you take some of that million dollars and buy shares. So aside from doing just enough to keep the people from doing a bank run and ditching en masse, they're typically focusing on keeping whoever owns the bank (whether private or the shareholders in public) happy.

Also some banks have grown very large and powerful, and it seems typically this leads not to better service from a bank with the muscle to give that kind of service, but more red tape to go through for everything and in the case of institutions like Wells Fargo a succumbing to greed where even the huge revenues they enjoy versus a small institution is not enough, so they start screwing people over and doing illegal or it-should-be-illegal things to aim for the high score. They have ""F-U"" money, where it doesn't matter if they're caught anymore."

Then one night she told me about how she purposefully tripped a skipping little girl in order to make her fall. The little girl completely smashed her face open. The girl I know told this story in the context of how horny blood and tearing flesh and pain makes her. and how hot it had made her to completely destroy this perfect vision of naive, pure glee when she fucked the kid up.  
She got arrested for murder in connection to some drugs she had sold someone that a person had OD'd on. In the raid, the police found not only machetes with dried blood on them (which I guess is.....expected?) but also a LIVE grenade and a bunch of ammo for an AK-47......The girl I know was caught/arrested because a runner for her had accidentally befriended/ brought over an undercover cop.

The girl who brought over the undercover cop was so sorry that she took out a loan and paid the girl-I-know's bail.

The girl-I-know was then talking to some of my friends about how she couldn't wait, was so excited and anxiously awaiting 'the video'What video, you ask?

In order to get back at THE GIRL WHO PAID HER BAIL, the girl I know had gotten a 65-year old dirty old man she knew to go and violently rape the girl, tape it, and bring the tape back to her.She was so excited to see the video of the rape she had requested. Of a girl who took out a loan to pay the-girl-I-knows bail. And she wanted it to be as awful as possible for the girl. Specifically got someone old, violent, poor hygiene, and to tape it.Consensual my ass.

I nope'd right out of anything to do with her.

PS: She also had a 24/7 slave. I'm okay with people doing what they want with their kinks but in this case I kind of wondered if it went into abusive territory. It was full-time, he wasn't allowed to interact or make eye contact with guests, I never saw anyone say anything even approaching nice to him when they HAD to acknowledge him. When the house got raided it came out that he was hiding out there and was wanted by the police for violating a restraining order against him by his mother."

"Man, same here. Broke up about 2 weeks ago.

She thought that, just because she did small things for me and I didn't do them as much as she did, that she loved me more. If I made one small mistake, like the time she came over but I couldn't buzz her in for a couple of minutes because I got distracted, she'd storm away and get upset for 3-4 days while expecting me to bend over backwards to make her feel like I love her as much as she loved me. I had to prove I wanted to be with her and she'd want me to change my behavior, which I naturally didn't want to as I'm not a pushover, and it would just make her more upset. She'd say things like ""I love you so much and I would do that for you, why can't you!?""

It was difficult because, while those 3-4 days sucked, the other times were especially nice with her. I just found that the frequency of her ""tests of love"" were increasing and it was adding additional stress on top of my stressful life at the time. Once I broke up with her she sent me a text about not being a real man and blocked me off of everything.

I kind of want to call her and explain this shit to her so she can work on it for her next relationship, but I honestly tried during the relationship and she never seemed to get it.

"I wish I could say I had a manly story behind the scar on my ass. Back in 2005 I was part of a World of Warcraft raiding guild (Inspire - Spinebreaker US). We had just started on Blackwing Lair. We were spending hours trying to get the strategy right to down the first boss. Things were frustrating wipe after wipe, but largely uneventful. Then, with zero warning, the screw holding the back of my computer chair in place completely sheared right through, the back came off and fell backwards, me falling backwards along with it, and my ass landed on to the metal bar sticking out of the back of the chair. This caused a 1 inch cut that went really, really deep. *(A bit of context: I was 16 at the time and actually underweight. I was by no means too heavy for the chair to cause the screw(s) to snap in half! It was just a defect I guess, the chair was only a few months old.)* Trying to explain that one to my mum (a nurse with medical supplies) and show her as I obviously couldn't really take car of it myself was so awkward. Then my older brother wanted to have a look. In the end it took ages to heal and made sitting down a literal pain in the ass for awhile. It also caused a very embarrassing raised scar that I still have today.

She would just go uncontrollably apeshit.

It basically taught me to never EVER own up to any mistake or cock up, no matter how minor it was because I was expecting a nuclear explosion if I did. This caused me major grief once I left home and went to university, and in my first couple of jobs. Its been a hard lesson to unlearn.

It's kind of hard to explain so please bear with me. Let's say I tap my finger kind of hard on a table.

(no thanos memes intended) It's unconfortable and completely induced by myself, but it can become a little unbearable if I focus on it.

Another example is when I play a game in first person. When I see people play games and stream them, they will sometimes do a full character rotation and continue playing. This shit annoys me and it really shouldn't, but in order to bring back balance, they need to rotate back in the other direction. But then they only rotated clockwise and back so now they have to rotate counter clockwise and back to make perfect balance again.

It's wierd and I feel like I'm the only person that has to deal with this. Sorry if this didn't make sense."

"**Relative penis size compared to overall body size (or pretty much any secondary sex trait) is highly correlated with where a vertebrate species social mating style falls on a spectrum from monogamous to harem-like.**  The more monogamous, the more pronounced the secondary sex traits (and the less sexual dimorphism).

Monogamy in this case refers to one-to-one pairings, even if they are short-lived or unfaithful, while harem-like refers to the practice of many females pairing with one or a few elite males.  Secondary sex traits are physical traits that distinguish the sexes but serve little other purpose (breast size or feather color).  Sexual dimorphism is the set of non-sexual traits that nonetheless differ between the sexes in a species (upper body strength, physical size.)

In a harem structure, mates for males are more or less guaranteed by elite status, while directly attracting mates via secondary sexual characteristics is largely irrelevant to reproductive success.  So, in a harem structure, sexual selection favors an arms race in traits that help males gain elite social status and largely ignores secondary sexual traits of both males and females.  All secondary sex traits tend to become less pronounced, including penis size.  

In a monogamous species, reproductive success for males and females is all about the secondary sexual characteristics - both mechanical and aesthetic - since females have to be either seduced (or captured) individually.  Thus secondary sex characteristics in such species tend to become more pronounced in both males and females. Larger penises are more visible and more pleasurable, and in the case of a less-consensual pairing, they stick in further.  

**Gorillas have a very strong harem structure,** with the alpha male generally chosen due to physical strength.  As such, male gorillas are very large relative to females, very strong, **and have very tiny dicks.**  

**Humans fall pretty far to the monogamous end of the spectrum.**  Our mating behavior depends heavily on individuals finding each other attractive - even in actual harems.  Meanwhile, social status doesn't help human males reproduce that much more efficiently, which means human males don't have to participate as much in the arms race to be the biggest and the strongest.  All this means that human males are not much bigger or stronger than our females, and we generally look pretty similar to each other except that **our males have terrifyingly large penises** and our females have incomparably large breasts."

#Steve Harvey throws his hands up in awe. He just can't believe it, he begins pacing around the place while that famous music plays. The white family shrinks in the corner, proud in an almost silly way while they're laughing and hugging. Steve is on his knees now in disbelief as the audience cheers harder. Steve is crying, Steve is bawling his eyes out as he walks around. Steve begins banging his head against the wall, and kicks a hole in it. A man walks up and Steve knocks his lights out, and proceeds to take a bite out of his face. People start screaming. Completely mad with disbelief, Steve Harvey chases the white family around the room. ""IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?"" he says, as he pulls out his massive 3 inch flaccid cock and chases them with it. The poor father of the white family is the first to go as he trips and falls into a corner. ""SURVEY, I'LL SHOW YOU A PENIS"" Harvey says as he jams his into the mans mouth, and then pulls it out and begins to devour the man's flesh. ""Stop Steve"", says the white man, but its too late to appeal to his moral barometer. Steve is still crying, screaming ""WHY, OH WHY"". Suddenly Steve rips off the man's pants and yells ""OH LOOK AND THERE'S BALLS TOO"". Suddenly the survey board makes that noise, and ""BALLS"" shows up as the number two answer.

"Bulk and skull from power rangers. Hear me out. They weren’t bad guys per se at the start of season one, but they were bullies. Their whole point was comic relief cuz they were inept, but they were still bullies.


Throughout the second and third seasons, they start getting different jobs, and go through different experiences. They adopted a pig once, that turned out to be a monster, but they genuinely cared about raising it. They actually wanted to be seen as heroes at other times. For purely self serving purposes, but it was growth from their initial bully characterization.


Then towards Zeo, they start hanging out with lieutenant stone. They help him out with his police duties. Then when he loses his job, they quit and help him with his detective agency. Out of pure loyalty to the guy. Similarly, they follow him and help him run the juice bar after Ernie leaves in Turbo.


Then, In Space they hang out with the crazy professor, and their characters take more of a peripheral role because the actual rangers are spending more time in space looking for zordon. But at the end of the season, when the army of bad guys are overrunning earth, Bulk and Skull have an I’m Spartacus moment, to help the power rangers. But it doesn’t end there. Once the power rangers, still weary from their previous battle that had ended in defeat, show up to reengage the bad guys, they’re hopelessly outnumbered once again. Bulk and Skull see the rangers can’t win the fight by themselves, so they charge the masses of foot soldiers, and encourage the rest of the civilians with them to fight along with them.


It was a fitting end to their characters, I think, to end up as real heroes."

"I think that the context of who is doing what and where also applies here. They have a small classroom of 12 children and there's 2 teachers there. The boy is a known trouble maker and he gets in trouble on the regular, while my girl is seen as very shy. From experience I know that if a kid who is not known to get in trouble came up to me and said they were punched and they punched back I would believe the shy kid pretty much all the time. Especially at the age of three where they haven't yet developed their lying skill and I have no reason to believe so otherwise.

It was very much a case on case lesson and was really meant for that specific kid. He has caused so much grief to my little girl. "

"Rear Window (1954) - I know its considered a classic, but there seems to be people I know who've never heard of this movie. Everything about the movie is great. The plot, the pacing, the dialogue and the tension, and of course Grace Kelly.

Akira (1986) - I still can't believe this was made in the 80s. It was way ahead of its time and there were movies that came after this which got inspired by this anime.

&amp;#x200B;

Sleepy Hollow (1999) - I'm a fan of Tim Burton and he made something of classic here, but doesn't enough credit for it. We also Christopher Walked, without his speech style. Still one of Johnny Depp's best movies.

"I don't think most people care about other people's health. They care that a fat person is fat and unhealthy but saying ""no, it's okay for me to be like this"" which insinuates to other people that it's fine to be fat. THAT'S the issue. Saying ""You can be fat and healthy"" is a blatant lie and you're out here circulating it. 

I would think people have issue with ""Healthy at any size"" for the same reason they have issues with Flat Earth and Anti-Vaxxers. It's purposefully spreading misinformation. And, in extreme cases, being refuted with false evidence.

If you want to be fat, have a heart attack, and die by 40. Cool. But you have no right to sit here and tell the next generation that what you're doing is okay. "

The bigger the word the better in my mom's mind(she had a Master's in Old English and was a linguist), so my word choice from these letters would be hydrochloride. If I was the first person to say a word that had every letter in it, I would get the points. For the points, you had to add 9+5+6 = 20.

"I see where you're coming from, but I suspect the OP is rather on the younger/less experienced side of things, and trying to get a general idea of what may or may not be acceptable before you... err... dive in... is not unreasonable.

I don't know about you, but when I was a teenager I was worried enough to fuck that whole sex thing up as it was, nevermind the additional pressure of talking out things I had relatively little clue about (even having grown up with a fairly open minded family) without much of an idea of what might get me a ""YOU WANT TO DO WHAT?!"" (Turns out my tastes are mostly fairly vanilla, but still)

We've since added so many more social mind fields (some necessary, some absurd) into the equation that I don't even want to know how stressful a first sexual experience is for a teenager today. Crowdsourcing a bit of prep work is a better approach than most.

You can't expect people to just sagely navigate human sexuality and all the social mores and rituals and ideas around it with practiced ease any more than you'd expect someone with no training to just get into an airplane seat and perform a transcontinental flight. Just saying ""talk about it"" doesn't cut it (Although it is, of course, correct, just not particularly helpful in those circumstances)."

"The beginning of porn when the two people just rip their clothes off and bang. What you don’t see is off screen there is a director and a script and both actors know what they will be doing in that sexual encounter. Men, to save hook up culture as we know it, please talk to your partner about their turn ons/offs as well as yours before sex. Not only does this make for better sex because you know what the other person wants, but it makes girls feel more comfortable with you and more willing to speak up if they like or don’t like something during sex. I know a conversation doesn’t sound sexy because we don’t see it in porn, but IT IS. It doesn’t have to be an hour long discussion, but it’s better than cluelessly jack hammering a girl for five minutes and leaving her completely unsatisfied. "

Somehow he didn't think to pull the trash can closer, so he was turning, taking a step and dropping the parchment in the trash, dripping bacon grease the entire way and making a huge fucking mess.

Whether you know it or not, you can't fit all your skills on one sheet of paper. I suggest altering your resume based on the job you are going for. For a building superintendent you will want to state that you are willing to be on call 24/7, that you have excellent customer service skills, and that you know your shit. It's good to have a little bit of experience in everything too (electrical, plumbing, and carpentry). You can usually work out relevant skills from any past job. I don't know if any of this will be helpful to you or not. I was personally in high demand when I loaded my resume to a job searching site.

"This is key. Everyone talks about the Aladdin movie's ""Three Genie Rules,"" no killing or resurrecting, no manipulation of minds or emotions, and no wishing for more wishes.

It's like a sharp something as my vagina adjusts at the first penetration. We had tons of foreplay, but the muscles just weren't fully relaxed and that's ok. It was a pleasurable sharp something and now it's gone. 

Or the tiny dull pains that happen in certain positions and I wonder to myself which organs are being assaulted now. It's not Bad Pain, the soft bits are ok and honestly would get more oomf from a kicking unborn baby. And the amount of pleasure I'm in helps me ignore whatever vague discomfort is being caused.

"The reason Kaepernick was kneeling in the first place... The equal treatment of black people by police.

Burn your Nikes. Seriously, listen to any show and the argument is always *immediately* shifted to politics and proper anthem etiquette. It's never the should we do something about the unequal treatment of black people by police debate. 

Here's a clue, it's ok to not be cool with kneeling and still recognize the very real concern of police brutality and racial profiling.  It doesn't have to be one or the other.  

Yes, I know. Some players have spent some money to help some communities... But it's not enough. This is systemic and no one in either political party has literally done anything to help the cause. They just all weigh in on the kneel debate.

"Actually, in my experience the really wealthy people are usually very purposeful people with good people skills. They give WAY beyond their ""fair share"" in many ways including money and mobilizing other wealthy folks to do the same. They help those around them in ways that are usually completly hidden to us common folk. There ARE some despicable people in the 1% but I feel like the dispicable ones are the 1% of the 1%, not worth killing the other 99% over.

I work for a guy that took a company from nothing to solid in 40 years. He has helped MANY in 40 years, with good solid employment, teaching the marginally unemployable learn how to keep jobs and become solidly employable, providing a safe environment for people to go as far as they ever would otherwise in life, and giving people who are disabled a place to work even if they can't really do the job to the extent that another could. 

I know th8s because I tried what he did and failed. He took a chance on me and over 35 years have gone much further in life personal, financially and professionally than I ever would have otherwise.

Yep, you guessed it, there are still people that think that the owner should bale them out financially with no questions asked and no strings attached just because they are wealthy. Why? Because they feel they are entitled to his money because they are bad stewards of their own life. They also don't see the things I do because they are not in position to see it and the owner keeps the charitable side very, very quiet.

Bottom line is I have tremendous respect for most of the wealthy and think they do massive good in our society and have tremendous distain for the 1% of the 1% bad apples."

"It should be. I’m not sure what the status quo is now, but our sex Ed started when we were in 5th grade. I definitely wasn’t taught that dicks were ever flaccid or hard and this was a very good school system, albeit in the Midwest. 

I’m really sorry but I’ve got to get things off my chest and I’m going to rant and share things because I really need to vent this stuff, and who knows- maybe someone will benefit from it somehow. Beware- this is a massive wall of text incoming. 


I learned about where periods and babies came from when I was maybe in 3rd grade- from Girl Scouts. My extremely Catholic and conservative parents never taught or educated me about anything. When I was in 1st or 2nd grade I asked my mom how babies are born. She said, and I quote, “You just have to ask God for one.” I remember this because as a small child and all the way to my 33 years of age, I was absolutely 100% sure I never wanted to have a baby. I remember praying to god every night and even during the day at school, saying “Please God don’t ever give me a baby” over and over again. Fast forward to the 3rd grade summer Girl Scout Talk. 

After the Girl Scout Talk, my mom for the first and only time talked to me about periods that night and that was the end of any and all talk about reproduction. She never once asked me about sex- just about periods. I remember being really traumatized and crying a lot because I was scared and my mother (whom I do love very much) was and is a very poor describer of specific details. She’s not very book smart but she isn’t stupid either. She happened to be very horrible at explaining periods, and that hers was really painful and heavy and that she was already going though menopause so that didn’t help any.

When PSR came about (that’s Catholic church confirmation- usually takes place around 8th grade) they touched on puberty a bit there. The class was divided between boys and girls. A husband and wife team taught reproduction (which by now we already had the basics of) and taught us about family planning. After that lesson, we were supposed to picket the Planned Parenthood building the next day. For reasons I’m just now learning, my mom-to her credit- didn’t feel comfortable letting me participate.  

I remember having to learn from my friends exactly what hurt and where and all that shit. I’d live vicariously through girls in middle school who would talk about their first gyno exam. (I didn’t start menses until 16, so I was pretty behind the curve) I had to beg my mom to buy me a training bra when I was in 5th grade, and I mean really beg. I was ashamed that all the other girls had sports bras or training bras and I had nothing. Fortunately, one of the Girl Scout moms suggested getting me a bra for school to my mom, and that worked. I remember trying to learn how to shave my legs in junior high- spoiler alert- it didn’t go well at all. I would ask other girls in gym class and they all said their moms taught them but I knew I would never be able to ask my mom. The night I tried, I cut my kneecaps so badly I got scared I couldn’t stop the bleeding. My aunt was visiting and I ran downstairs and they helped me clot everything. I lied and told them both I had got my knee caps shut in an old hope chest in my room. I was so embarrassed. 

I remember being a high school sophomore and had a Social Issues class. One of our assignments was to ask our parents a list of questions and have one of them sign the bottom of the paper- stuff like “What would you do if you found out I was in jail?”  or “What if you found marijuana in my room?” Well one of the questions was “What would you do if I was pregnant?” My mom got super offended and REFUSED to answer the question and said that the answer would be “that would never happen” and she signed it. 

When I finally did get my period, I was only allowed to wear pads. My tutor (a wonderful woman) helped me a lot during this phase. She articulated to my mom that wearing a thong for my homecoming dress was far more appropriate than showing an obvious panty line. She helped me understand why that kind of underwear wasn’t necessarily racy to my mom (which was tremendously helpful a few years later) and also about what to do when going swimming. She really made my mom face the fact that I was going to have to learn how to use a tampon if I ever wanted to swim on my very unpredictable and heavy periods. Mom still refused and was very uncomfortable and dismissive whenever these tidbits came up. (My tutor had a daughter that was a year older than me and went to a private school)

Those awful periods? Eventually they got so bad (I was missing school) and my mom agreed to take me to her OBGYN. I was so excited. I got put on a type of medicine that was basically “the pill.” The OBGYN, really drilled me on if I liked kissing boys, what I like to do when I go on a date, etc. It was definitely an uncomfortable visit, but thankfully I had done a lot of fielding questions from my friends, and it was just the really awkward questioning that was the worst. I remember my mom filling out all of my forms for me, checking all the boxes that say “how many partners do you have a year,” or “how many times have you been pregnant?” Etc. After my exam he talked to my mom for a super long time. 

When we got home, my mom asked me to get a knife for her. She took it from me, grabbed my right hand, pressed the serrated edge gently to my knuckles and said “For every time I find out you’ve been fooling around on this medicine, I will cut off a finger.”

The rest was blurry, but she said something about how I am not to ever come home if I’m ever pregnant or something like that. To just stay ran away. Think of what that would do to my father, etc. 

A good 6 months later, I finally could even attempt using a tampon. It took forever to figure out how to do it right. I didn’t get it right for a long time, and even before I did I proudly mustered up the courage and told her “man, these tampons really hurt, how do you manage to wear these?” and oh my god was she pissed. She said I had no business wearing them at all unless I was swimming. I told her that I also shaved my legs and that I wanted a more beginner friendly razor and she scoffed, once again claiming I didn’t need to. 
That was that. 

By the time I started to finally build up my confidence and establish my own boundaries, I was 18. I somehow found the balls to ask my mother a question no daughter should ever be afraid to ask their mother. 
“Mom? When is it okay for me to have sex?”
I’ve never seen her more mad and horrified at the same time. 
“WHEN YOU’RE MARRIED, MY GOD!” Then she said something about how I better not be messing around on my medicine and some other bullshit that I’ve mostly blocked out. 

Even though I’m at peak novel length, I’ll try and sum the rest up. I wanted to have sex before I went to college so I could prepare myself and learn more about sex before I was surrounded with the culture of being away from home (literally 30 min down the road) and what not. Gave away my V-card on my own terms (which I could write another novel about how absolutely not different what so ever I felt afterwards, contrary to millennia of forced purity bylaws) and ended up having a healthy amount of partners throughout college, re-evaluated my spirituality and religious beliefs, deflowered two men, and one of them ended up being my husband of now eight years. I partied hard and studied harder. I always had $500 cash I kept in a secret place and a best friend who I could trust to take me to planned parenthood if I ever got pregnant, which- thanks to self-taught safe sex, modern medicine, and not Jesus- I never had to have. No kids. Just pets. And I consider myself really lucky to have only a few mild mental disorders from my upbringing. 

I’ll never forget the day after I lost my virginity, though. I laugh about it now, but it’s pretty fucked up when you realize how far removed I was from my understanding and fear of sex. I called planned parenthood from a payphone at the mall. I asked the receptionist if I needed to schedule an exam. Looking back, I can almost hear the “oh honey” in her voice. She said to call back if I miss a period, and that I would probably be fine since I was both on the pill, (took it at the same time every day never missed a day) AND used a condom AND did it right after my period. 

To this day my mom thinks I was a virgin up until marrying my spouse. Oh and fun fact- she is the very definition of a gaslighter. She will deny all of this and say I dreamt it. She’s a piece of work, but I do love her.


Sorry to anyone that had to read this. I’m on mobile and I guess something struck a nerve in me. If it weren’t for the school and the help of a few adult women, I’d have an extremely unhealthy view of sex that was catered by Catholic PSR, a Christian organization (Girl Scouts) and my mother.

"I am the same, and I'm into comic books (and just nerdy pop culture stuff really, like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc) as well. But I'm always so self conscious about it because whenever I say that I enjoy one of those things as a hobby, I get teased by my friends and coworkers. ""What did you do last weekend? Oh let me guess, you played video games."" I'm even worried that other coworkers will see me as incompetent at my job because whenever I'm tired at work they like to imply that it's because of 'the video game'. It's not much better when it comes to dating prospects and whatnot, too. 

Also when I mention that I'm into gaming, guys immediately seem to back off and become intimidated by me for some reason. In college, my guy friends who I'd sometimes play local multiplayer games with will tell me things like, ""No one will date a girl who likes the things that you do."" And here I thought that having a shared interest might be a good thing, lmao. "

"Me and my wife were at the beach one night and decided to go out on the pier. Even from the beach end we can see a small group of 4-5  people all the way out at the end in a small little cluster. As we're walking down the pier we can faintly hear them talking but can't understand what they're saying. We get about halfway down when all of a sudden this one really big guy breaks off from the group and starts walking quickly towards us and we can hear one of the other people start shouting at us. We thought we had interrupted a drug deal going down, looked at each other and noped the fuck out of there.

A couple days later we get a call from one of my wife's uncles asking why we ran from him at the pier. Turns out two of her uncles went on a two day drinking and fishing bender and we happened to stumble upon them in the middle of it."

"OP is me, dork. I don’t give a good goddamn what anyone, Reddit or IRL, thinks about my number of sexual partners. Who taught you to think in such blanket terms, anyway? An entire half of the population lies about how many sexual encounters they’ve had? You think some men don’t lie about it?

Maybe other women lie about their number of sexual partners, but any woman having sex with 100+ people probably doesn’t care what anyone thinks and would just admit to it. I’ve always been completely open and honest about my sexual history with my partners, and no one has ever said “oh you’re not girlfriend material,” and the great thing is: I wouldn’t care if they did. Also, what makes you think the ultimate goal of my life is marriage? If the number of partners matters to you when finding someone, whatever. But don’t try to impose your arbitrary moral standards on others. What works for you doesn’t work for everyone else, and it’s not a big deal.

The point is that it’s okay to experience what you experience sexually. Whether that is a small penis, big penis, small breasts, interesting-looking vagina, large number of sexual partners, whatever, it’s okay. And it’s goofy to shame an entire half of the world because you have some weird complex about sex."

That was considerably more depressing than the depression at the time.

"I see this as a parenting issue.

Many of my friends had a similar reaction after high school (both those who went to college and those who did not, though to slightly different degrees).

I was thrilled to be done and had absolutely no issue “adulting”, and I attribute that (based on my own personal evidence and that of friends who felt the same way vs those who did not) to my parents. As soon as I could have a part time job I was expected to - not because I had to work, but because I wasn’t going to be doing anything fun otherwise, they weren’t going to blindly pay for everything anymore once I was able to help pay for things I wanted to do myself.

They also never shielded me from the fact that being an adult isn’t all roses. Work sucked and they were exhausted at the end of the day, but also glad to be home with the family. Paying bills sucked, especially when us kids left lights on or the water running. Worrying about something breaking on the car/house/kids/themselves sucked and if something did break it meant we’d all have to realize that we weren’t going to go out to eat or order a pizza and were going to eat at home. 

Not that it was ever something I had to worry about as a kid or was deprived in any way, but just that I was informed as to cause and effect - work sucked and that’s why mom wants to be alone for a few minutes before she deals with dinner, the electricity bill was way too high this month and everyone needs to remember to turn the lights off when they leave a room, the A/C broke and in order to stay on budget that means we’re not going to do x, y, or z for a couple of weeks. 

Meanwhile the friends who never had a job, never had to care about anything that went into keeping life running at home, etc. all freaked out when they got to the “real world” because they had no idea that all that crap didn’t take care of itself and they’d have to be mindful of it. 

Maybe that doesn’t apply to your situation at all, but it’s definitely something I’m thankful for and will be mindful of when raising my kids - protecting them is natural and healthy, but it’s not the same as hiding everything from them. "

I gave each nipple a very thorough inspection and found nothing ""weird"" in any way. I didn't want to ask her in what way they were weird, so I just let it be."
I can *see* why some men might think it’s “unfeminine” but I disagree with it. I love a woman with a great sense of humor! Own that shit and don’t let people bring you down about it. People only say things like that about women because of an insecurity within them. The guy has GOT to be the funny one and women can’t? That’s silly. 
I love drinking. Definitely not a fan of dancing. I like to drink and do relaxing things. Being around big crowds with a shitload of noise and a bunch of roided up bro's that want to start fights is not my idea of fun when I'm drinking.

Dude my ex gf worked at a convention center and had to work as staff during an anime convention. She actually cried when it was over. That's how terrible it was.

"I'm a whiskey guy too. I'm not rich by any means, but I make more than I spend most months, which means I can spend money on stupidly expensive stuff occasionally.

We've got a niceish liquor store in town. I occasionally order nice stuff I want to try through them. Think $100 dollar bottles, not $1000 ones... But a hundred buys you some pretty great scotches when you're not an ocean away from Scotland.

It's literally a mon-and-pop store, IE the people behind the counter are always the married couple who own it. They're mostly a wine shop, but they do whiskey on the side.

Whenever I order something special, and the husband is there, I always suggest we taste a drop. And we usually do. He likes that, and so do I. Geeking out with a fellow whiskey lover over the first taste of your new purchase is much more fun than having a first taste on your own!

(I offered the wife too, but she doesn't drink whiskey. So I don't offer anymore.)

Not allowing glitter or googly eyes prevents litter and possibly prevents animals from being harmed, but it doesn't ruin the game; people can still paint the rocks.

Groups making rules to prevent possible harm to others/animals/property/the environment is a good thing, but it's important that they follow two guidelines: they need to make sure there's a logical explanation for their rule (especially if it has a large impact on what's being done); and they need to stop their members from ""jumping down the throats"" of people who don't know the rules. Gently explaining to people the rules and why they exist usually results in an enjoyable, welcoming community, but torches and pitchforks almost always create drama and drive people away.

Unfortunately, too many groups neglect one or both of those guidelines, and that's when bitterness, pettiness, and ugliness cause alienation and ruin everything."

"Reminds me of what Hunter Thompson wrote after the attacks:

*They were the first flights of the day from American and United Airlines, piloted by skilled and loyal U.S. citizens, and there was nothing suspicious about them when they took off from Newark, N.J., and Dulles in D.C. and Logan in Boston on routine cross-country flights to the West Coast with fully-loaded fuel tanks -- which would soon explode on impact and utterly destroy the world-famous Twin Towers of downtown Manhattan's World Trade Center. Boom! Boom! Just like that.*

*The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now -- with somebody -- and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for the rest of our lives.*"

To be clear, I don't need a break from my wife or my kid, they are not the problem at all. I need a break from all the shit that accompanies a life of responsibilities.

House needs repairs, lawn needs to be mowed, baby needs to be fed, birthday presents need to be purchased, dishes need to be done, dog needs to be washed, cat litter needs to be changed, garbage cans need to go out on the curb.

Everyone has a giant list of SHIT they need to do. I want a break from that list because that list multiplies exponentially once you have a family and a house. I wouldn't trade it, mind you...I just want a break from it."

"First night on the job as the watch commander for a security / law enforcement group at an Air Station. I had been working there for about a year but got promoted and it led to me running one of the shifts.


I had another worker that was supposed to be my 2nd in command. He had more experience than I did but he was new and it became apparent over time that he was a major slacker and didn’t follow any rules very well.  Let’s call him Timmy.


So about 1 am Timmy decided he wanted to run a security drill. No big deal, just gotta brief dispatch and get a safety observer posted so that no one thinks it’s a real event going down. He wants to just cross the red line of a restricted area on the flight line. He doesn’t want to brief dispatch because he doesn’t want them to announce we are going into a training environment - this always led to the guards being more alert, obviously, as they knew something was going down. He wanted to sneak in and plant a box by one of the planes THEN announce the drill.


I argued with him for a while and finally he went back to his email or whatever he was doing. About 30 minutes later one of the guards in the F-16 area pipes up on the radio “Dispatch this is &lt;UNIT&gt;I have an intruder in my area - he’s carrying something and not stopping.”  I was in the office with another guy and he gets this panicked look on his face and said “Where the fuck is Timmy?!” The radio piped up again with “Dispatch, &lt;UNIT&gt;, I’m taking the shot.” Immediately followed by “Its me! It’s Timmy! Don’t shoot don’t shoot!”

If a financial crisis, automation, climate change or anything else makes the job market even more fucked up than it already is, a lot of young people are going to end up with massive unpayable debts through no fault of there own.

In the netherlands, the terms are very lenient (pay it back over 30 years, almost zero interest rate, if you earn minimum wage or less you dont have to pay anything back yet, if after 30 years you havent payed everything back you dont have to), but having a massive debt can still lock you out of the property ladder.

Basically, We grew up with instant physical and emotional gratification which conditioned us into our lazy attention whore habits. We didn’t do it to ourselves. And we didn’t know any better. We are the way the previous generation raised us. So before pointing fingers at us, look in the mirror and think about the world your generation dumped us into.

"You’ve described the exceptions, not the rule. Most kids don’t do AP classes, most kids don’t do varsity sports, most kids will never ever get anywhere near a fusion reactor. The vast majority of kids are average students who take normal classes and get mostly B’s. 


In 2013, 33% of graduating students took at least one AP exam. But that doesn’t account for AP classes because you don’t have to take the class to take the exam. You just have to pay for it. Only 20% scored at least a 3 on one exam. And these days, even a 3 isn’t good enough for college credit at a state university. My AP English and Calculus exams weren’t accepted by my college with a 3. Only my AP history exam was accepted since I got a 4. With two 3’s and a 4 + my GPA, sports, and extracurriculars, I’d have gotten automatic acceptance to any in-state university if I graduated 4 years earlier. 


So yes, AP participation is going up about a percent a year, but it’s still very far from “most kids take 4 AP”. Most kids don’t even take *one*. And 1/3 of the ones that do don’t get any college credit for it, which makes it a waste of time. "

One teacher told everyone that we just didn’t care about our kids education because we had a lot of chaos going on the first six months of school. (The hotel was far away from the school they attended, we didn’t buy the obligatory giant list of supplies the teacher wants us to get for the classroom, homework sometimes was messy or just not done because another kid may have had a meltdown and with no private room to go to it made it hard for the others.).

Edited to add: I heard about it from another teacher. She said to my daughter, Mrs. X said your parents don’t care about your education so I won’t expect them to come to” open house or back to school night. Bitch. "

"I know mine is. I once saw a video of a bridge covered in tourists, running from a mama bear and her two cubs. I saw that the people were taking pictures and such, but every time the mama bear moved they backed off even further. They weren't charging, just cubs playing and mama keeping up with them. I saw it and what I wanted more than anything in the world at that moment was to be there so I could go and pet the mama bear. I'm not stupid enough to go for the babies, but I'm definitely stupid enough to go to pet the mama.

My wife doesn't want me to go camping now."
"IQ tests are excellent for testing the types of intelligence tested in an IQ test, and nothing else.

"Holy shit you dense mother fucker. I’m not blaming her for getting raped. I’m saying she made a absolute terrible decision to go to an unchaperoned party hosted by a guy she literally watched rape her friend. 

In no way is that a good decision. She’s at fault for putting herself in an extremely dangerous position. She knew what that guy was capable of and went to his fucking house. This isn’t a “she was dressed like a slut” thing. This is a she picked up a rattlesnake and was surprised that it bit her.

There’s victim blaming and then there’s not doing obviously stupid things. And your crazy ass does a huge disservice by muddying those lines. 

It doesn’t take ANY blame away from the rapist to hold people to making rational decisions.

"I'm not advocating an increase of minimum wage. I'm saying we need to reconsider the power dynamic and equalize the negotiating power of worker and employer. 

It's much more complicated than passing a law that dictates the smallest hourly wage a company can pay. Doing that will largely do what you're saying because there is no balance of power and prices can just adjust to match. 

However, if employers actually consider how much it costs to run a household, and recognize that it shouldn't take a higher-than-average job to be able to afford a well-maintained roof over your head in a safe neighborhood, and having children and the reality of costs of childcare and healthcare are considered basic needs. Anybody that says they are less of a basic need than food or clothing is lying to themselves. 

Nobody should work for most of their waking life for somebody else that is making a fortune but still be unable to afford to have children, or have to choose between their electric bill or their healthcare copay. 

There are government centric solutions but they wouldn't be needed it employers didn't treat employees like a capitalist asset to be exploited and viewed them as human beings."

"I have a pretty bad case of ADHD. My social skills are garbage. There are many aspects of life in which I have a lot of trouble. I'm completely immune to so many types of medication, and the typical stuff for ADHD doesn't work for me; adderall, concerta, vyvanse, ritalin, what have you. So my only option is cognitive behavioral therapy and just dealing with it.

As I said, there are so many things in my life that I'm just subpar at doing. I always seek an answer that a normal person would seek, because I don't think of myself as being a person with a high-end case of ADHD, I just think of myself as a person. 

But pretty much everything, after I chip away at the reasons I'm not good, it always comes back to ADHD, which really makes me hate the disorder. It didn't bother me that I had it when I found out, it was relieving to know there was a reason I was the way I was. But if the plethora of things in my life that I just cannot be good at would be fixed by not having ADHD, then I truly feel cursed."
"Yea i hated that feeling tbh. It made me uncomfortable. Choke on my words. Blush. And behave very socially awkward. I only ever remember this happening once. And the strangest part about it? Im actually now repulsed by the same person today. Nothing really has changed. Hes still the same person and pretty much looks the same as before, just a few years older. My taste in men has just changed that much i guess. "

"That's how my girlfriend is!

Her last boyfriend was really abusive and a terrible guy to be around.  And I do believe her to an extent (I've met the guy once, he's an ass) but she's no bundle of sunshine either.

She always complains ""I gained 50 pounds when I was with him because he would never cook at home, he would always make us go out for fast food"". And now, SHE always makes ME go out for fast food. For somebody who seems to be hating fast food so much, boy we sure do seem to eat a lot of it when we're together!

There are other things too. She can't take criticism very well, at least not without saying ""but what about MY feelings!"" She'll never let you be upset about something, she always has to deflect and it always has to be about her. She also snaps often over the dumbest things, to the point where you often have to choose your words carefully when talking to her. It's just a lot of classic signs of an abusive partner coming from her.

So I'm convinced that her relationship troubles were at least partially her fault. I'm sure the guy wasn't much better, but there's no way it was one-sided because she makes me want to dive headfirst into a wood chipper at least once a week."

"In the 70's, a middle class/upper middle class house wife would likely not have been able to afford full time servants, but might have hired in for a dinner party. In any case, at that 'level', even if she could afford a maid, she likely would have participated in the kitchen somewhat, since one maid would have struggled to do everything by herself in a decent-sized house."

"Women can smell low self-esteem, and it’s as potent as you think.  They’ll sleep with you if they find you attractive, but they’re not gonna keep you around if you don’t value yourself enough to bring value and love into their life.

Self-esteem and hygiene can bring any 1 to a 4, and confidence will make you a 6.  If that’s your baseline, being competent and confident while emotionally mature and attuned to her will make you a 10.  You don’t need to look like Chris Evans to get a girlfriend, but nobody’s gonna dine at a restaurant when the staff slacks off and the food is gross."

"I met this girl a number of years ago who had a reputation for having casual fuckbuddies all the time, that's totally fine with me and when she got flirty with me I was open to it but she promptly shut me down when I flirted back. Fair enough, maybe I got mixed signals I thought, we were platonic friends for years after that and it never came up again... until she got engaged and mentioned to me that she lamented us never banging when she was single. Her exact comment was ""I would've ridden that dick like a pornstar if you wanted me to"", to which I replied ""you were the one to shut that door, you made it clear you were not interested""

When she said she was just playing hard to get I told her I don't play those games, if a woman wants a one night stand she should say so and if she wants a long term thing she should say so and if she says she doesn't want anything then I'm not gonna pressure her. Don't be surprised if you play a game and lose."

While objectively they are better than me it still hurts that my parents think so too.  Even thought they are conservative demons who gobble the corporate cock every chance they get.

"I thought the story was terrible. The galaxy was as shallow as a puddle. Seriously, the Angara were so uninspired.

On its own, Andromeda was an okay game. But compared to the depth and richness of the Milky Way galaxy in the original trilogy, the Andromeda galaxy felt flat, boring and bland. Oh no, another mysterious machine race. Oh look, bipdel alien antagonists. Oh look, a desert planet. The characters were also totally forgettable. Why do all of the asari look the same? Why do the planets all look like Arizona? The mission structure was overly repetitive as well. 

The characters in the original trilogy were amazing (bar some duds like Jacob and Kaidan). You actually cared about them and what happened to them. I honestly didn't care about any of the characters in Andromeda because they weren't interesting or engaging, besides maybe Vectra. Peetee was annoying, you had uninspired human characters 1 and 2, a krogan who is basically just Wrex but less funny, the Angara guy and I think there was another one.

I guess that's my issue with Andromeda. At the end, I just didn't give a shit. And that's a sign of poor writing. Even ignoring the poor facial animations and tedious gameplay, Andromeda could have been forgiven if it had an engaging plot. But it didn't. ME1's gameplay was pretty awful, tbh, but the story, music, world building and characters were fantastic. And that's why it's a classic and Andromeda never will be."

I had a desk job all through school (I went for economics) and *quickly* found out that that wasn't for me. I was a volunteer fireman for years before school in my hometown department (which is where I'm writing this comment from right now), and the love for the Fire Service that got into my blood when I was there never went away. At all. It's far more than a job for me. It's a calling. I love that someone can pick up a phone, dial three numbers, and immediately summon millions of dollars worth of equipment and dozens of people (on larger jobs) for as long as they're needed and with no questions asked. And while there's plenty of bureaucracy *within* the fire department—there's none at all that stands between us and the people who ask for help. How refreshing do you think that is?

It's not so much the adrenaline that drives my passion for this job. The adrenaline fades as experience grows. It's showing up at a house with fire blowing out of every window—threatening the homes on either side—and kicking that shit straight in it's fucking teeth that makes me giddy to go to work. I work with a crew of *fantastic* firemen who know the difference between 'good' work and 'Great' work, and it's the drive to do Great work that I find so inspirational. 

Our station is fully within the worst part of our city. It's an absolute ghetto that no one *wants* to find themselves in. But they deserve a Fire Service none-the-less, don't they? *Someone* will need to do this job, and if that's the case, I want it to be me.

"Haha in college I was walking my dog one day and I was sick of being single. This girl walks up to me and pets my dog, and we sort of flirt. We awkwardly part ways. I kick myself for like 5 minutes and decide to run after her with dog in tow. Ask her out. One of the most out there things I've ever done. 

First date she says she hates coffee. I can tell she's super conservative, annoying and childish. Never speak to her again. "
You kidding? I think Buscemi could do whatever he wanted to me.

"They are.  She got pregnant and they got married shortly after that, although she miscarried.

Truly I'm more hurt by the fact that all our old friends still hang out with them regularly and not only that, but everyond gets *so pissed* if I dare to seem less than thrilled with their relationship.  I decided to avoid going to a Halloween party when i learned that they would be there and got shat on royally for it.  Not going to their wedding (which, again, used our original wedding date, our ceremony and reception location, our DJ and catering which my deposit paid for, our decorations and colors, and even my engagement ring) was a huge faux pas and I was banished from our friend group for months after that.  No one would answer my texts, and I was blocked from most people's social media.  I didn't say anything bad about them.  I didn't throw a fit.  All I did was throw away the invite and not show up.

Sorry for the long posts but jeez you have no idea how good it feels to rant. In our small town I have to keep it to myself."
"This isn't due to them willingly picking themselves up, dusting themselves off, and moving on with the gumption of an action hero, it's because they're too preoccupied with what's happening in their immediate vicinity, which no longer contains the dead hamster, which has been sent to the back of their memory along with the everything else unusual that happened the previous week.

I have a deep voice, like guns and motorcycles, and work a manual labor job in a warehouse, but I also take a teapot to work for loose-leaf tea, had mostly female friends through school, and if I get too drunk in the club there is some chance I'll end up twerking on the bar.

Honestly I wouldn't have it any other way. After highschool I really embraced doing what I liked to do without considering whether it was masculine or feminine and it's the best."

"I caught my ex husband cheating. 

Over the next few days, an unbelievably sordid tale emerged.

He was trolling Craigslist for desperate women. 

He found one. 

She had had a stroke and was hemiplegic and suicidal. Her disability made it difficult to come up with ways to kill herself, but she had one idea. 

She would take sleeping pills, drink and put a plastic bag over her head. 

Of course, getting to the store was a hardship - enter Craigslist ad, which essentially boiled down to “I want to kill myself and need help. Will pay.”

Except my creeper ex didn’t want money. He spent a whole week convincing her that he would bring her the pills in exchange for sex. 

And he actually followed through on it. The day of, he sent her a photo of his bag overflowing with boxes of OTC sleeping pills, and she responded with her address. 

Of course I am left to surmise the extent of what happened while he was there, but her texts make it clear that she got what she was after. 

And so did he. "
Then you get to imagine all the monsters/ghosts/killers fight it out in an all out free for all smackdown in order to decide who gets to kill you.

"&gt; And there aren't any changing stations in men's rooms?

Only about half of them. I've never witnessed a guy take a baby into the restroom to change its diaper and I've only used one once.

We were in a department store and my wife asked me to change the baby's diaper. I take him to the men's restroom. No one is in it. This is a normal sized restroom -- 2 urinals, 2 stalls, 2 sinks. The changing table is opposite the sinks, not in a stall.  I start changing the baby and a guy walks in. He sees me and immediately stops, apologizes, and turns around and walks out. When I exited him and 2 other guys were all waiting outside ""in queue"" to go in.

Since then my wife hasn't asked me to change any diapers if we're out in public."
"Worrying about what others think of your job at all, I'd say.

I graduated this past May with a bachelor's in chemistry. I'm managing a coffee shop/pub.

I occasionally get flak or worse, pity because I'm not doing something in my field. But the thing is that I fucking love my job, and I'm making more money than I would in one of the *few* entry level chemistry positions in my area. To top it off, my husband and I have a bit of a pipe dream to open a bar, but we knew we didn't have the experience to do it well. Now? We're on a path that could lead to that silly dream becoming reality.

Two months into this job, and we're already able to start building our savings. We're in the process of slowly replacing our crappy shit with nicer shit. We're starting to actually be able to have a financial plan that isn't, ""Well, if we pay the gas bill this month, we can probably swing electricity next month.""

I could go on about all the perks I get (free coffee, a schedule that leaves time for hobbies, job satisfaction, etc), but the gist is that I'm about as happy as it's possible for me to be.

Oh, and I've lost 15 lbs since I started working there. I'm literally working my ass off, and I couldn't be happier. "

The girl in the prom dress and mask has been a really popular costume where I live for the last few years, I asked one lady about it at a convention (she was like, the fourth one I'd seen that day) and she said it was really exciting for black horror fans to have a fun character to cosplay. The rest of the character masks from the movies can be done really easily with EL wire so I think that helps too!"

"Well, the memes are incredible. Some say they're the best memes. The meme quality is YUGE!!!!"
"Yeah. The ""Liberal arts majors suck"" is such a fucking stupid reddit circlejerk, and so is the ""just study stem lol"" meme. For the vast majority of STEM fields, a bachelor's degree is not enough to secure a career. You need at least a masters for most fields with the exception of some fields of engineering and computer science, and even there only having an undergraduate degree will limit you. Also, CS careers don't automatically get you 6 figure jobs- the average graduating salary is about $65k, and that's skewed by the minority of people who land jobs at big companies."
"Buttcrack, once a week"
"No no, that's my interpretation. She said to me that I didn't take things seriously enough or something like that. I really don't hold it against her, she didn't like me. She could have been a little more civil about it, but she did change that when I asked her, so it's all fine. My point is some people are not going to like you. You may just be too different. That doesn't have to be an impediment to work together for example."

"There's something incredibly satisfying about taking a partner from being on top in bedside sitting lotus (where both parties have a lot of control), to man standing (behold me holding you up with my arms, legs, and dick!), to turning around and dropping her onto the bed and leaning down to kiss and re-enter for an energetic finish.

Honestly this was how the best single session of my life ended, with a mutual finish at the end. "
"Meetings can be extremely productive when they have a very tight, defined purpose with defined outcomes. 

The most productive meeting I was ever a part of was a weekly sales meeting (I was in sales). Around the table sat salespeople, managers, engineers, and marketing. We went through every opportunity in the pipeline and asked the sales people ""What can we do to move this forward? What do you need?""

When there was technical issues - the engineers jumped in.   
When there was pricing issues - the managers jumped in.  
When there was promotional issues - marketing jumped in.   
When things simply fell through the cracks - sales jump-started them. 

The best part was that when things went off-course (like sales and marketing getting into a full on conversation) the managers said ""write it down and talk after this meeting"". There was no ""side"" chatter allowed, just pure task-at-hand.

We pulled millions out of that meeting. Literally millions that would have died on the vine. 

The absolute worst meetings are ""general"" meetings where people just complain about how things ""should"" be. Which is like.. the rest of them. "

That means the LGBT community still has a lot of work to do in terms of acceptance in a world where gay rights is a relatively new thing.

Edit: Unless you meant the opposite, in that the United States is one of the more accepting countries for LGBT rights, in that I would agree even though my country still has a lot of work to do ,e.g., ban conversion therapy and include anti-discrimination to include the LGBT community in regards to workplace and housing.

Speak your feelings clearly. If you're unhappy in the relationship tell me before you find someone who will make you happy. And don't go into a long term relationship expecting near constant fireworks only to be disappointed once when we get comfortable together. Time goes on and sometimes I'd rather sit at home and watch a movie with you than go out and do something romantic every other day. 
"Right on the fucking nose!!! I learned the hard way that telling my ex-girlfriend anything in confidence is pretty much a guarantee that her best friend knows as well.

"I should probably point out that I disagree with Peterson on this issue, despite what I just wrote, because he entirely dismisses the effect of social conditioning on consent with the way in which he defines ""culture"".

And yes, culture can interfere in your ability to make informed, individual choices, which is why it DOES make sense for feminists to push for a very neutral culture."

"We had a guy at work that would have to top everything you said. At some point we just started making stuff up to hear his story. Come to think of it we did a lot of things like that to him. We used to take bets how many times he would say um on our conference calls. Then there was the time we isolated him saying ""oh shit"" in a video he was in (engineering, we are always shooting videos of test results and such). He left his computer unlocked one day and we added ""oh shit"" sound as his default notification in windows, but we renamed the file to be the same default  name as the sound he had setup. He was never smart enough, but too proud to ask for help, to get rid of the sound. Sitting in meetings if he had his laptop open and got an email, you would hear him say, ""oh shit"" and he would scramble to turn down the sound. This continued through the two or so years he had that laptop. Oops, that was a long tangent."

As others stated above, it would be understandable for a succubus, but you -might- be able to stretch that to her in the whole ""Laws if hell"" kinda way.

"I have not played for very long, but I run a game with a *lot* of players coming and going. Never had a problem with rape or sexual assault with any of them, in character or out. It's just that geek culture has a tendency to attract social outsiders, and that means that it will often times attract people who have less social experience and people who people tend to stay away from in general. So some of these players are not going to understand how to interact with people, and the ones with rape and racist fantasies are the ones that stand out.

The vast majority of players are awesome people and any decent DM would crucify a player who starts that shit. These stories are the worst of the worst and hopefully nobody who is interested is turned off from the hobby from them."
"Asking about people's hard and soft limits is a great thing to do in  a session zero. I always make sure to go first (I usually put ""rape"" as a hard limit and ""sexual content generally"" as a soft limit) to encourage the players.

For anyone who might not know my item terminology - a hard limit is something that you're not okay with happening in your game, at all, ever. A soft limit is something you're not okay with participating in, but are willing to accept at the table from other players. So, as a DM, I'm not going to allow any players to rape anyone, ever, nor will it be a plot point or even just background. Sexual content in general isn't something I'll participate in - if you want to get with an NPC it'll be a fade to black. If you want to get with a party member, however, you too can rp that as much as you want, allowing for other players' limits.

If multiple players have the same soft limit, I try to treat that as a hard limit as well."

"When I was in my early 20's I was constantly late for probably everything but especially to work. I'd constantly sleep through alarms and end up late. Back then I would go to sleep at like 1am and had to be up for work at 7 the latest. Now, I go to bed between 10-11 and wake up at 6:30 pretty much every morning even if I don't have work. I also used to be extremely tired allll of the time. My sleep schedule was super erratic and I didn't realize just how big of an impact it had on everything else. I used sleep very little or way too much but was still tired. I used to think I was just a ""night owl"" and not a morning person. Turns out, I'm totally a morning person if I keep on a good schedule."

We were talking about travel and I said I don't mind getting to the airport early. Because literally every single trip I find conversation and people to talk to. I don't seek them out. They tend to find me. But I'm happy and reciprocate.

He just paused and said ""I can't think of any situation in which someone randomly talked to me at the airport for any length of time."" I was like ""but everyone talks to everyone in airports!"" He said ""No, FM, they don't.""

And rogues have to actually hide from everyone else at the table in a couple seconds in order to pass a stealth check to hide. Otherwise they don't get sneak attack from the advantage of being hidden.

One night when my mum was tucking me in (aweh) she pointed out that the bear was looking at me and said “it’s as if he wants you to cuddle him to sleep again, he loves you.” I didn’t really think much of it but every night when I put the bear on the floor it would always seem to be looking at me. It wasn’t until about a year or so ago that I started to find it a little creepy. It always seems to be looking at me. I obviously love the bear cos of how long I’ve had it and I’d never throw it away but I can’t help but think its a little bit weird.

"Worked at eb games which is Canadian gamestop from 2012 to 2014. During the  midnight for the Xbone we had a decent line up of people who had preordered the console and only had enough for them. We had explicitly told people for months that we only had what was preordered and no extras and reminded everyone in line before we reopened at midnight that there were no extras. Skip ahead to us opening up and selling all the consoles and other stuff with it without issues because people are usually in and out quick and we are also trying to speed the process along because most of us had to be there the next morning. Most of the people there were regulars and had done this before so there was no issues until big red walked up to the counter. Now big red was a regular and got his name for being a fucking huge ginger but he was one of those customers would would barely interact and would just grunt what he wanted to you and then stare dumbly you until you got it for him. Now BR was with his buddy who had preordered and I knew that BR hadn't because I Remember telling him to and he just brushed me off saying he didn't preorder anything ever. Now I have him in my line and he walks up saying he wants an Xbone so I ask him for his phone number to get his preorders when he tells me that there isn't one but he still wants an Xbone. I explain to him that unfortunately there isn't any extras as we had told everyone in the line and over the past few months. He starts getting more and more upset and is starting to yell that he's not leaving without one and that we better get him one now or else... Now at the time I was prepping to be a Mountie and all stupid 145lbs of me decided to be mouthy and say or else what. He proceeds on some rant about he's going to fuck us up and wreck the store and the sorta stops and realizes he's in a store full of people all with their phones up recording and because we are in a smaller city knew him from around town. His friend look mortified and was trying to get him to leave. BR's face was crimson with rage and embarrassment and just before he walks out he spits a huge loogie onto me and somehow on too my boss as well who fucking exploded. Buddy left and we sorta forgot about it until or district manager brought up a complaint we had Recieved from this guy. We told him what really happened and he said it was a non issue. BR would still come around but after the second or third time of everyone refusing to serve him he got the hint he wasn't welcome. He would still come by with his buddy but would sulking outside the store after that.
TL/DR adult who can manage his expectations throws a hissy fit for not getting want he wanted, threatens then spits on me and boss and then isn't welcome back to store. 

Second quick story this guy was in our store near closing with his younger child like 4 or 5. Guy stops in back corner of store  near the employee door and is staring at something out of out view. My boss and I were behind the counter prepping to go home when my boss  walks out to talk to the guy and suddenly screams what the fuck are you doing. I pop my ahead out and I see the kid squating over the floor peeing on the floor and some product. The dad looks up at us with that  like what is your issue look and says we'll I didn't see a bathroom and she had to go ( there is a huge empty  lot  next to us if she had to go that bad). He then grabs her hand and leaves and goes into he movie theater next door. My boss already hated kids prior to that and I honestly thought he was going to punt the kid(not that it was really her fault.) 

Fun fact I am now a Mountie and was spit on more as an employee at eb games then I have been as a cop for the last 3 years

Without provocation, he says ""I'm glad you're around to talk to, cause I'm sick of all these *fucking* soccer moms."" As he says ""fucking"", he smacks a big ass final fantasy guide onto the counter.

Smash cut to my face: locking eyes with the woman bent over next to me.  She stands up, and bewildered says ""well, thanks a lot.""

She was actually one of our regulars whom adored us, so it didn't turn out all that bad. We had a good laugh after he apologized.  Me, I was just stuck in the middle of the most awkward exchange ever."

"I wouldn't go that far. When I was in basic, I don't recall ever missing a meal, but there were some times where I really did wonder just what the hell I had gotten myself into.

A lot of the people in my platoon said basic was probably the least stressful ten weeks they had ever experienced as an adult; no worries about clothes, food, where to stay, money isn't a concern (hopefully).  Now, granted, a lot of it is because you have no choice in the matter, but it's the best worst time of your life for a reason.

But I would sure get some weird customers. Porn. So much porn. Guys would always have pictures of pornstar boobs as their wallpapers on their phones when they would bring them in for me to figure out what was wrong with them. One guy insisted we transfer everything from his old phone to his new phone, opened the photo app to make sure everything transferred, he had a folder full of pictures of various girls with butt plugs in. Multiple girls, all with but plugs. But I would take a phone filled with porn over assholes that would yell at me for no reason any day. Definitely do not miss working for that shithole. "

"Had something similar happen in a game I was playing in. Guy was playing a ""Chaotic Neutral"" character, which to him (for whatever reason) meant that he should flip a coin between 2 arbitrary decisions whenever he was faced with an important action. At the end of a boss fight a player character gets knocked out but is still able to get resuscitated, this ""chaotic neutral"" guy is up next and decides his 2 paths were to ""coup de grace the player character that got KO'd"" or ""resuscitate him"". The flip goes to ""coup de grace"", and he kills the other player. The rest of the PCs see this and we immediately subdue and kill him as revenge. 


Guy then gets mad and throws a fit that he was just RPing his character and that it's not his fault the coin flip went that way, as if his arbitrary decision of killing another PC wasn't evil or detrimental to the group at all.


Don't ever kill another PC unless you have a really, really, good reason. It sours the entire experience for everyone, and people take that shit very personally."
"He did sweet talk a fictional character. How it works is this--each player tells the DM what their character is doing, and the DM tells the player what happens as a result, sometimes needing a dice roll. The DM controls the world and every character in it that's not played by a real life player. So in my scenario it went something like this:

That Player: ""I give her the flowers I bought.""  
DM: ""She accepts them and tells you they're beautiful.""  
That Player: (in character) ""Not as beautiful as you, my angel.""   
DM: ""Roll diplomacy to see how well you impress her.""  
(That Player rolls very well).   
DM: ""She blushes and seems very flattered. She asks you when she'll see you again.""

"Correlation, Causality, something something.

It's not like the ""researches"" went out and told a bunch of people to follow these three rules and then measured how well they did. They got a ton of data, filtered for 3 relatively obvious markers and looked at the percentages.

There is a strong possibility that there is a third metric (like being born into a middle class family - just an example) is the reason for managing to follow the three rules AS WELL AS having a reasonably large chance of being in the middle class.

Still. They're not *bad* recommendations. But the data these numbers were generated on is time-delayed. There's no weight behind the promise that IF you do this you will see the same results.

Make more eye contact when listening than speaking. 

Observe other people's patterns of eye contact when they are speaking to other people. For example, it's normal when talking to look around a lot and then make really strong eye contact when you finish to indicate an opening for the other person to speak. After a while, you will notice little patterns like this that will really help.

"D&amp;Ds been getting more popular since before Stranger Things and even before 5e.

\- Let's Plays like Critical Role and TAZ have lots of listeners who've never played before, and many have now gained an interest in playing and understand the basics of how to play.

\- Video game RPGs &amp; MMORPGs like WoW, Skyrim, Dragon Age, etc. have similar mechanics to D&amp;D (pick a race and class and go on a fantasy adventure), which has introduced people to the concept. I know a lot of people who got into D&amp;D because they liked RPG video games and wanted to do something similar in real life.

\- 5th edition is wildly streamlined for ease of play compared to previous editions and Pathfinder. Before, you had to know someone who knew how to play to you teach you/DM. Nowadays, someone who has listened to a Let's Play to get the gist of how to play and has skimmed through the Player's Handbook (or even the free basic rules) can DM a group of new players. That's made a huge difference in accessibility.

\- The internet also allows people to find groups, whereas previously you had to know people who were into it. Roll20 and Meetup are the main resources, even /r/lfg.

\- There are way more game stores now than there were even 10 years ago, partially due to tabletop board games gaining more popularity. Resources (books, minis, etc.) are easier to find locally, and many game stores have events where people can find groups.

\- Lots of adults are depressed, feel reality is bleak, have trouble meeting people, etc., and D&amp;D is a fun social event that is creative &amp; imaginative, it literally allows you to become someone else. Collective storytelling is something humans have been doing for a long time, but there aren't a lot of avenues for doing it these days. There aren't even a lot of social activities adults can do for free, usually it's pay to drink at a bar, but D&amp;D is a fun hobby where you're creating just for the sake of having fun, and it can cost as little as you need it to. It's even popular in prisons where people need escapism and something creative/fun/social to do.

There are a lot of factors. Stranger Things is one of them, but hardly the sole reason it's become more mainstream. Most new players I've encountered in the past 5-10 years became interested through The Adventure Zone, video games or just had friends who played and wanted to try it out. There are also lots of veteran players around who've been playing since the 80s. "
"He wasn't frail in the first movie, but he did seem kind of weak and ill in the second movie (he was in poor health by that time). But he nailed the first movie. When he shouted ""Silence!"" as the students were panicking, we got a glimpse of his potential as a powerful character with more to him than meets the eye. (Edit: I do think that some of my dislike of Gambon's Dumbledore is because of his costume. Instead of the rich, purple robe and flowing white hair and beard that Harris had, the designers gave Gambon old grey robes and a thin, straggly grey beard. I found him to look more weak and frail than Harris's Dumbledore.)"

"To be nitpicky: it is, but it is a watered down Italian espresso. Which is still stronger and more concentrated than the espresso you get at Starbucks (it has to do with the machine’s operating pressure). 
A proper Italian espresso shouldn’t be more than two thirds of an ounce, with a dense, creamy texture from how much is concentrated. If you let the machine running it will get less concentrated, as most of the oils have already been extracted. So you get a lungo, and if you go beyond you have an americano, but it doesn’t really go over the one and a quarter/ one and a half ounces mark.

"I think ""not doing it publicly"" is the most important bit to me.

If you're being stoic at me, and you're not able to vent or communicate emotions around me, then I only get your public face.

I don't want a partner that shuts me out of their private face 100% of the time. I get that some things you want to keep to yourself, but if you keep everything to yourself, then I feel like I'm trapped in the public sphere, not the private. And that's not a bonding thing."
"that reminds me of a similiar thing that happened to me. I was in a new town staying with an ex gf I was on good terms with. Apparently the room mate was into me and she asked the ex if it was ok before all this happened before I knew she liked me and got the go ahead from the ex. That night we had a party, a few hours in, we end up alone in the kitchen.

She tells me she is into me and all that and off we go to the back bedroom for a healthy make out session and foreplay. The room mate is straddling me and grinding while we are making out. My pants are half undone and after 30 mins being drunk we both have to pee and want a smoke. 

when I stand up I notice I am soaking wet on the lower half of my body. In the dark I chalk it up to her and we head out. In the hallway she screams. I look down her hands are covered in blood I'm covered in blood. We both dash into the bathroom since we are in a house full of drunk college students and we are both covered in blood we look in the mirror and have bloody smudges all over our faces and necks and our lower halves are soaked in blood. 
Frantically we strip down scouring ourselves to find out where all the blood has come from, nothing...

We don't have a mark on us, she isn't on her period she checked and neither of us are in any pain. Several more minutes of looking happens both of us going over each other's bodies looking for what happened. While examining my penis it gets a little hard and the blood starts to flow. 
  apparently while grinding the metal zipper of my pants pinched a blood vessel right below the head of my dick put a pin sized hole in it. With all the stimulus it bled like a stuck pig. When it went down in our panic it pinched itself closed and you couldn't see it. Neeedless to say we didn't work out. "

"They cast attractive people in movies because they want to appeal to the broadest lowest common denominator out there. The stereotypical male/women attractive person has the a set of features where most people are likely to be able to pick at least one or two and go “That’s hot”. Its not a guarantee that every person on the planet will find them attractive, and even in those that do, they won’t necessarily like every facet of the person.

People care about looks, sure. I mean, by and large I don’t care, but even I’ve outright said I could not date someone I consider ugly. I just have different standards of ugly and attractive to what you describe. It depends on culture, status, the individual themselves, and a whole bunch else besides. If you honestly believe what you wrote, you just haven’t honestly talked to enough people."

"That is probably true in regards to porn consumers, but if I recall, women who watch porn also tend to gravitate more towards watching other women regardless of their sexual orientation.

Women are generally just more appealing to watch and look at. Vaginas are seen as soft, sensual, and welcoming (mostly) and penises are seen as hard, rough, and intrusive (mostly). Not to say there aren't the exceptional outliers on both sides, though.

There's quite a few societal and cultural studies on the appeal of men vs. women. Interesting stuff."

"Honestly? From my point of view it's not even a lack of willingness, it's just that men don't know what kind of sound to make.

Hear me out on this one. There's a lot more media/pop culture that tells us what a woman sounds like when she gasps/moans/cries out in pleasure so they have more to draw from in order to be audibly sexy. This is true of mainstream movies, television, porn, literature, you name it. However, when was the last time you saw a movie, TV episode, or a porno where it focused on the guy making noise that wasn't strange awkward grunting? Imagine, in your mind if you will, the sound of a girl orgasming. Something comes to your mind straight away doesn't it? Sounds arousing (if you're a male, probably). At the very least, you have a very clear thought in your head of what it's supposed to sound like. Now imagine the sound of a guy orgasming... What actually comes to mind? As a guy, I don't really have a clue. The closest I can get is either weird grunting or some kind of overblown ""roar"" that sounds gross from an auditory perspective and partially from a social perspective.

Guys don't make noise because they don't know what noise to make. Better in our minds to make no noise at all than to make a really awkward, creepy, and mood killing noise. It's the equivalent of not talking dirty when the only thing you can think to say is, ""you like that, you fucking retard?""

At least, this is my opinion on the matter. Just don't let anyone tell you it's because they grew up jacking it silently. That's a bunch of nonsense. Girls masturbate too."

She’s the best I love her so much, I love that she doesn’t ask and just does it to show that she’s not taking my kindness for granted and to show that she loves me as much as I love her, while money isn’t everything, it’s a lot when your in college and making nothing, the fact that she does this over and over again with out fail blows me away."

My first time was with a more experienced partner and it turns out that making an effort to understand what your partner wants — communicating, trying a few different things, even not worrying when something doesn't work and brushing it off — goes a surprisingly long way.

And guides on the Internet.  This is one where you have to be careful, because some of the advice out there is just not good, but it seems to me that the advice marketed towards men tends to be better than that marketed towards women.  There's a book called _She comes first_ or something which is all right.  Just take stuff with a pinch of salt and, most importantly, be relaxed about it and have fun with it!  At the end of the day, there's not much point if you're too stressed out to enjoy it."

"I have a friend that owned a porn video/toy shop for several years in the mid to late 1990's. I helped out a handful of times and worked if people were sick or on vacation etc.

A few things I remember that were strange/funny/creepy.

1. A woman came in and was walking around looking at various things. A few minutes later a guy came in. At this point there were 4 or 5 people in the store including those two. A few minutes later I heard some noises so I walked to the back of the store and the girl was naked, bent over and the dude was doing her from behind. I told them to stop, they can't do that in here. The woman just picked her clothes up and walked out naked, annoyed at me because I was taking away her place to ""get her fuck on!""

2. Guy tried to return a jar of cinnamon flavored lube. When I asked him what was wrong with it he said, ""It burns my lady's asshole."" I couldn't take it back since it was opened and partially used. I suggested a few lower priced lubes he could buy and he just shrugged and said, ""It ain't my asshole,"" and left.

3. This was back when people still rented DVDs from places like this. A guy wanted to rent a few DVDs and when I entered his info into the computer it came back telling me he was banned from renting (it didn't say why). When I told him I couldn't rent to him, he flipped out and started screaming at me. I told him I could sell him the DVDs but I had to charge him the full price or he could come in tomorrow to talk to the owner. He insisted I rent him the DVDs. When I refused he exclaimed, ""Fine! I hope you feel good about yourself. My needy cock is going to have to go without because of you!"" and he stormed out of the building. I found out a few days later he was banned because he would rent the DVDs for a few days then when he brought them back he would try to buy them for $5 each since they were used. When the owner would refuse he would get pissed and make a scene.

There were a few that were creepy just because they went into the ""booths"" and moaned so loudly everyone in the store could hear it. My favorite was a guy who asked if I had any cheap ""cock sleeves"" before going into the booth. When I asked what that was he told me it was like a sock you came into. I told him we didn't but suggested a few things he might buy (like a male sex toy etc) he just said, ""Nah, looks like a sock is taking one for the team today,"" and he merrily headed into the booth.

Depending on my weight and time of the month, they are a C or D. My nipples are also a bit larger and go inverted sometimes. It's so hard for me to see them as attractive and even more difficult for be to believe my partner finds them attractive when you always see a completely different type of breast being idealized all over the place (media, porn, etc), which I'm sure is why so many women are so incredibly insecure about theirs as well.

Lo' and Behold, there is a mountain of evidence, he was so dumb, he sent her videos, texts, photos via snapchat. He said in court that they cant be real b/c snapchat deletes things, that's why he sent them. Wow. He is also a lover of guns, in one photo (with a freakin caption!) he threatens to shoot himself if she doesn't come back. Then tells the judge that he was only kidding b/c he would never really do that. Judge is visibly annoyed and pissed at the guy, b/c he was belligerent and interrupted the judge and girl constantly. He lost, had to turn in his guns, go get mentally evaluated, serve some jail time, could never contact girl ever again. Dude kept digging his own grave."

"I mean, I can see a reason there might be a weak correlation. When people say ""whites"" they are usually using it in a context where white people are the majority. So the idea is that a racial minority would be more likely to accept and understand that gender and sexual minorities would have different experiences than them. But that kind of logic doesn't always hold up in reality. Even in the LGBT+ community, people belonging to one letter will deny the validity of other letters. Gay and lesbian people will say that bisexuality doesn't exist. Plenty of people that are a sexual minority will say that gender minorities should be kicked out of the movement."

"For me, yes it really was that easy. For years (probably from age 8 to 21) I would constantly worry about being a terrible person because of these thoughts. I would obsess over them, I’d feel an extreme amount of guilt, I felt like something serious was wrong with me. I could temporarily distract myself from it by hanging out with friends, but when I didn’t have things like that to preoccupy my mind, my thoughts would just run wild and make me feel like shit. Then I came across an article describing a particular form of OCD without the compulsions, and as I was reading it I just remember thinking “this describes me EXACTLY”. One key point in the article was basically asking the question: do you WANT to be thinking these thoughts, or are they completely unwanted? I’m paraphrasing from a 12 year old memory, but basically it went on to say that you shouldn’t judge yourself by these unwanted thoughts, but rather how you respond to them. If you feel that they are terrible and don’t want to be thinking these things or acting them out, then guess what? You’re not that bad person you think you are. The thoughts don’t define who you are. And it was at that point that it clicked for me. These are just intrusive thoughts that I don’t want to be thinking. I shouldn’t give these thoughts so much power and I should just let them run their course and forget about them. I’ve been so much happier since then.

Absolutely go get professional help though if you feel you need it. No sense in wasting your life feeling terrible about things beyond your control. Good luck :)"
"There was no difference between ""before"" and ""after.""  Things like when people were born or when contracts were written (or w/e) would be simultaneously in the past and the future.  You can't start construction on your house until 2050 even though your parents finished building it 40 years ago.  Your grandpa that died in 1970 is, in some systems, alive and expecting a pension check for another 70 years.

Also maybe your Jan 1 bills would be past due as of 100 years ago and you'd have 100 years worth of interest due on that student loan you just took out.

Generally, sport ends up being an outlet and an opportunity for disadvantaged and excluded groups who may struggle to achieve or be prevented from achieving more mainstream success.

"In a similar vein, my wife and I recently went to a Microcenter on 3 different occasions to purchase some parts for a gaming computer that she was building. 

Three things happened - 

Visit 1.) A sales guy tried to ""help"" us when we were looking for an 8gb GTX 1080 and he made some offhand jokes about my wife not actually needing that much processing power because she was just gonna play facebook games. My wife, I love her to death, has a barbed tongue when she get's upset and I didn't feel guilty at all when she ripped into that guy. We left without buying anything after telling the shift supervisor what happened.

Visit 2.) We went to the same Microcenter and the sales guy who approached us is what I imagine a caricature of an incel would look like. Late 20's, early 30's, hunchbacked, greasy hair that was slightly slicked over a bald-spot, with illfitting clothing that very obviously hadn't been washed in a while. He first addressed me, and when I deferred to my wife and he found out she was building herself a gaming computer, it was like a switch got flipped and he went like the super-saijan version of creepy. He mentioned that it was so attractive that a woman was into gaming and that he was going to find her the best pieces that he had stashed in the back. He would keep shooting me dirty looks and try to edge me out of the conversation and made my wife so uncomfortable that we left without purchasing anything. He tried to follow us out of the store to ask when she would come back so he could make sure he was working. 

Visit 3.) I went in by myself, didn't talk to anyone, except for the guy standing at the display case to get a few sticks of RAM and the graphics card she wanted, paid and left with little fanfare. 

It was really disheartening for my wife who just wants to be a gamerbro too..."

"I foresee this going badly. Firstly, a biological sex change, even in the most scifi world, is probably agreed to be a one way street, otherwise there wouldn't be enough room in the normal human body for all the extra organs. Not to mention specifics, like nerves and muscle, etc.

Second, this is an extremist opinion. For one you are viewing this as a two answer question when it goes deeper than that. Imagine this for a moment: All the men in the world have gone through childbirth, and in your perfect world its all fine and dandy, but wait! Many religious, conservative, or generally opinionated women still object it. What now?

Or, more realistically, all men go through it, but still even half of the men against abortion standby it. At this point its backfired and they now have a reason to ask why you can't just accept, since they went through it and still believe in it.

Third, this generally mucks up morality and up to an extent responsibility. I understand we don't want overpopulation, and there are many perfectly valid reasons to get an abortion, but does that make it alright just for anyone to get an abortion because it's more pleasurable than practicing safe sex, or its easier to abort later than think about it in the now?

This also brings the issue of thrusting it into a new market never before thought up, which would itself require new regulations and laws due to just how volatile and popular it would no doubt become within the years it lives."

"I think people generally confuse life expectancy with the maximum lifespan. The maximum lifespan is almost the same now as it was 5000 years ago. 

Life expectancy is higher, but not just because of lower child mortality, there were plenty of things that would kill you. Even 300 years ago, you'd be very likely to die in your 50s, even if you survived childhood."

"I don't want you to keep thrusting after you've cum. I know your body goes back into regular-mode. But you could pretend to be into it and use your fingers or mouth. 

I tend to have to fake it in the beginning because it's the only way I get into it (thanks antidepressants). Or I'll be finished before he is, so I fake it until he gets there too and I would appreciate reciprocation.  Hell, I'll even do it myself, I just need you to pretend to still be into it. Keep grabbing me and acting like you find me sexy. Maybe even add some moans in there. At this point, I'm probably less than 2 minutes away, but if you suddenly fart and mention ordering pizza, the whole thing is ruined."
"My gf has a double whammy. She's incredibly sensitive, to a level I've never experienced before (mid 30s and had my fair share if previous partners)... But also has ocd which makes it almost impossible for her to climax.

She said she's not sure if she's had an orgasm before (and can't DIY it) which suggests to me that she hasn't.

We'll keep trying though :) it sucks a bit to know she's not getting the same level of enjoyment that I am but just got to accept it, be patient / responsive / attentive to her needs when she expresses them. "
"I am a man. I barely watch porn and I sure as hell don't copy techniques from porn.
My last 2 steady sexual partners were worlds apart. With one girl I could not be more gentle I have never been that gentle before and I will probably never be that gentle again. And still she was in discomfort and telling me I was being to rough. That obviously didn't work out.


So with the girl after her I started off more gentle then I would normally and for this girl I couldn't be rough enough the first few times she was complaining I was way to gentle while I was already being alot rougher then what I was doing with the previous girl.


You know how people like different things? 
SHOCKER it happens to women too. They don't all like what you like"
"That's how my boyfriend is! I went from a selfish prick who would pretty much tell me (hint that it was ending) I had about 10 minutes to cum when he went down on me. So I learned how to not enjoy the ride and just frantically force myself to orgasm. ....

This guy though. Whoa. I mean WHOA!!! He'll tell me he doesn't feel like doing anything when we go to bed (I sleep over there once or twice a week) which is fine. We meditate together holding hands and I pass out. I wake up turned on and very very wet and can feel him stimulating the upper parts and teasing the lower parts and then when I'm awake he'll spend an hour on my body. 

He doesn't really care for his own pleasure. His favorite porn is watching women enjoy oral. He says he gets off on making me happy....I tell him it makes me happy to get him off. So we compromised and he cums at the very end after I've had about 20-30(counting multiple) orgasms.... He said it feels alive in there after all those orgasms and it makes him cry out. It's my favorite sound! 

Make don't l some noise! "

"This doesn’t really fit the question but it’s something I’ve always wanted to share with my fellow peers.

A lot of people complain about how they never use Pythagoras Theorem and other maths stuff outside of school and it really pisses me off because you’re completely missing the point of school. School is mainly to test your ability in different areas (especially in maths, testing your mathematical ability) so people know what they’re good at and enjoy doing. Sure, in maths all we could do is basic addition and how to pay TAX but then EVERYONE would be getting exceptionally high marks, now when it comes to college/university how are they supposed to know who is going to be able to become an account/doctor/vet if everyone applies with a 98 for maths and 96% for Biology and how are we as students supposed to know why we want to be? I guess my question would be “Can you stop making a big deal about how pointless maths/whatever is?”"

"Though i can't say that I am very involved in politics, I can say the reason why I don't support Trump is because of his rampant unprofessionalism. He does not conduct himself in a way that any respectable man or president should, and in my opinion, that is cause for me to dislike him. I'm this way with any person who can't respect others and have civilized conversation. These kinds of individuals loose my respect. However, I would also like to say that I'm not one of those people who say ""He's not my president."" He was rightfully elected president, and though I may not agree with all of his policies. I respect and honor the decision of the voters who placed him in office, and obviously recognize him as my president. "

One man, a Brit during IIRC the wars in India, had his arm shot off, and instead of falling down and dying, he _pushed through the pain and charged up the hill with his weapon, slaughtering anyone who got in his way while blood spurted out his wound_. His fellow Brits were so inspired by this act of badassery they followed him up the hill while the opposing force was shocked at the cajones of this one armless man. His rampage would end in his death, but _only after his body was drained of blood_. Not bullet, not sword, but exsanguination killed this guy.

"Was helping my then girlfriend get ready to move out of her apartment and into our new apartment together, got into an argument and she handed me back a check I had given to her to pay for part of the move, saying pretty definitively that we shouldn't do it, she'll figure something else out.

Against my instincts, when I got into my car I didn't just turn it on and leave, I took a couple minutes to gather myself, and she ended up walking down and we talked it out with clearer heads even just that short time removed from the argument. Three months later it seemed like the best decision ever to calm down and 'fight' one team off that breaking point. Life was good, the relationship was good, we had made it through a really tough spot in her life that was part of what sparked the argument, and I was feeling like in hindsight acting against my instincts was the best decision of my life... 

Earlier I said 'my then girlfriend' for a reason though, because another three more months later it looked like the worst decision ever and shit came crumbling down FAST."

"Guatemala is a really nice place, but the recent history has been scarring and the corruption is (still) rampant. Part of the danger comes from being a white tourist (or even white local, although not to the same degree), especially if you don't speak Spanish. The locals generally know how to deal with most situations, but there are definitely safer countries in central America (like Belize, which has had a much more tourist-friendly development since since their separation from Guatemala, which is something of a hot potato).

Basically, don't talk about Belize to Guatemalans (or do). If you thought the masters of mass-belief in conspiracy theories were Yugo-nostalgists or Croatians you were wrong."

"It depends really. If it's a question of actual abuse going on in the relationship, then you should do what you can to help someone get out of that situation. It doesn't mean you get to swoop in and sleep with them as a reward though.

However, if it's just two people who happen to be in a mediocre or shitty relationship dynamic, I would lean toward mind your own business. You don't get to pass judgement on their relationship from the outside and take matters into your own hands. That is the literal definition of white knighting."

Hell, you don't even have to read far, it states in the second paragraph as much but they don't identify as religious when surveyed because Japanese people don't see religions the same way we do in the West and don't consider Shintoism an organized religion.

Also if you looked at the site I linked to you would see it states:

"[Human time perception and it's illusions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866156/) by Eagleman et al. (awesome name), is a pretty recent meta-review on our perception of time. Predictability modulates duration, is probably the most relevant section.

The short version is that repeated stimuli have a reduced perceived duration - which corresponds to lower neural activity. This is handy because it reduces the metabolic demand by the brain and is therefore likely why it's a trait that emerged/persevered.

The phenomenon is real but not fully understood. It's also super interesting because predictable stimuli (1-2-3-4-5), have a reduced perceived duration, just like repeated stimuli (0-0-0-0-0). There's loads more to it than that, and its not quite as black and white, but the experimental data is strong. 

Bottom line is that more stimuli =more time. So get stimulated!"

"&gt;My employer and people I work with like and value me, but I just keep getting more and more to do and absolutely no chance of receiving a raise.

If they do that they do not value your time, maybe just your personality. In a work environment your value is your time and skill. If anyone isn't willing to acknowledge that then they do not value you.

I appreciate loyalty and relationships a lot and I think money shouldn't always come first but you have to be able to find a threshold where money trumps all that.

I was in a position for 6 years and the last 2 years I stayed purely because of ease of aceess to work and relationships I had built there but ultimately they didn't value my time enough and I had to leave. Now, I work harder and building new relationships but I feel like I'm adequately valued which has done wonders for my self confidence."

"Part of the trouble is the massive difference between how men and women communicate.  Women are used to subtlety and reading layers beneath and between words. A lot doesn't get said out loud because it doesn't need to be - it was communicated in the negative space, or the extrapolation of what *was* said out loud. Repeating it in words implies that the person you're talking to is stupid and/or oblivious, and you don't want to call people you like stupid.

Apparently, men don't do this.

So you get a woman talking to a man, communicating perfectly openly and not deliberately hiding or withholding any information, and he gets in a grump because she's talking in code and obviously trying to confuse him into submission. He says ""Why can't you just *say so?*"" when he finally understands her, and she probably won't answer ""I did."", though she'll be thinking it, because she *knows* she said what she had to say in perfectly plain language, and he knows she did, so by now claiming that she didn't say it plainly he's obviously lying and trying to gaslight her.

It's a really unfortunate and infuriating situation."

"It’s my cousin but from the lack of replies I’ll tell his and the families story. 

My cousin, James*, and I were born a year and a month apart. I was the only blood related girl in the family, therefore I was showered with love as a child. He came from an extremely unstable and abusive home (that we didn’t even know about until he was 15ish and at that point the damage had been done). I only mention this because it will be important.

My aunt and uncle had more than their share of issues at home and around James. Drinking, vocal and physical fighting, lack of food, neglect, you name it, it was probably going on. James started out as a rude, nasty child towards the family. All the adults at the time chalked it up to jealousy towards the new “favorite”. 

One day, when I was about 8 (James 9) all the cousins were playing outside. We were just running around, playing tag and that sort of thing. I “tripped” on James’s foot. I fell face first into a fire ant nest (this is the American south). I tried to get up, but I felt an immense weight holding me down. I couldn’t scream, because the ants were all over my face and mouth. My older cousin ran over and pushed James away from me. He had been holding my head down. My mom was a nurse at the time and cleaned me up. I was in bed the rest of the day. I had 24 bites on my face and neck, at 8 years old. James never said sorry.

Years later when James is about 12 my mom gets word he took a knife to his mom. He sliced open their above ground pool and tried to stab her multiple times (succeeding once) as the rushing water pushed her towards him. 

He killed three of my grandmothers cats and threw them in the street to cover up the evidence. We found out years later after he was “better”.

This is only the stuff I know about. He eventually was diagnosed with diabetes and gained weight. His fits of violence were too much and his parents called the state; hiding their progressively terrible behavior. He was court mandated into a facility, put on a large variety of medications and released. He’s now morbidly obese due to medication and lifestyle habits. He can’t read or write but was passed through the education system with a full degree. I just remember him trying to kill me."

This hits all the right notes for progressives: reinforcing the narrative that women are oppressed, a woman sticking it to the patriarchy, and a possible transgender person.

I just commented that I thought it is unlikely that the story is true as told because it's just *too on the nose* to be true as stated. 50 downvotes. Someone responded and said they thought I might be on to somethings, 20 downvotes. 

We can't even *discuss* the fact that the dominant ideology on this platform might be burying inconvenient thoughts - that discussion has to be buried, too."

"Radiofrequencies. 

When layouting a normal PCB it's pretty straightforward: Just draw a line from A to B and make sure its 乇乂ㄒ尺卂 ㄒ卄丨匚匚 if lots of electricity has to go through it.

Sadly, once signals start switching really quickly, this gets more complicated. You can no longer treat the wire as a perfect connection: at those frequencies it'll have all sorts of capacitances, inductances and so forth that you need to account for as layouter (we call this impedance). So your simple ""Go from A to B"" job has gotten a lot more complicated because you can't snake the signal all over the place anymore.

Radiofrequencies have the fun property of being both incredibly high in frequency, and also incredibly weak. So you have to treat those lines like royalty. Simply putting the RF line too close to another wire is enough to ruin your signal. If I have to work on RF I specifically design the whole board so all the RF lines are straight. Just to save me the headache of trying to work out how curves work with RF.

And that's before you get some chucklefuck that decides he wants to use a PCB based filter and you have to draw some kind of [occult hieroglyphs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Stripline_PCB_Filter_2.JPG) to appease the black magic RF gods."

"One campaign I was part of was absolutely **FULL** of ""that guy"" characters:

•The bard who was loudly bi, ""Just like me ;p"" and would try to sleep with anyone/thing that was described as attractive. When one of the big bads appeared, she made a successful seduction check on our guide NPC and then left the world to its fate.

•The cleric who proclaimed their alignment as ""Chaotic Bitch"" and would refuse to heal anyone, hoarding all her healing for herself. She lost her God's favor after murdering a civilian for a Ring of Featherfall and left the campaign shortly after

•The mage that constantly had all the (wrong) answers. She made the brilliant decision of opening a book that was brimming with so much evil that **touching it directly** would deal minor damage, then touching the resulting Orb of Annihilation that appeared when the book was opened.

The other players were a blast to play with, both in character and out, so it's a shame that we had three other players that were so intent on ruining their experience. "
"I remember this so clearly like it was yesterday, I was around two years old and lived in a little cottage. Most nights a man would appear in my room. dressed as a kind of batman and take my dummy (pacifier) out of my mouth. Or point at me I would immediately start crying and he would disappear, and my mum used to find it on the other side of the room in similar places. Obviously a distance away from my bed. my mum said a few months later I used to come to the top of the stairs from my bed and say ‘there is a man upstairs or as I was young just kept saying ‘ a man ‘ and crying. and upon inspection she would find nothing. We spoke about it a few years later as I got older and she said she found out a man who lived their before used to dress up for children at fund raising events as a superhero and had died in the house. I seriously believe him to be some sort of ghost he was kinda faded and dark but the edges of his silhouette would be vivid with a kinda blue shine. He would either appear beside me or come through the bunk bed nearby. I’m in my thirty’s now and still remember the details. My memories of this time of my life are so clear which I believe as a child is something you may not remember so clearly but I could literally remember every detail. My youngest memory in this house is being washed as a baby in the sink by my mum and reaching out and touching her stomach. She then pushed my hand back into the water. No one really believes I can remember this so clearly but I really do! "

Jokes aside, the difference is that hard water contains a lot more mineral ions dissolved in it. This is caused by water passing through mineral deposits in the ground. These minerals are commonly magnesium and calcium.

Additionally, the softener works by displacing the ions with sodium ions, which will eventually need to be refilled by flushing it through with soda crystals.

"I just posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9d236g/whats_the_most_acceptable_form_of_abuse_these_days/e5fovl8/) a bit ago. Letting your kids do what they're interested in (while *maybe* attempting to give them a little nudge toward something if you can see they have a real aptitude for it) is definitely the best way to go. I was a D1 wrestler; my son decided he wanted to give it a try with the kids' wrestling club. He didn't have any special aptitude (no surprise, I only went so far out of love of the sport and many years of hard work, I wasn't particularly athletic, either). More importantly, he didn't love it like I did, so he quit. Why fight it? He's great at other things that he really loves, so I encourage those things.

You can't force your kids to be what *you* want them to be all of the time. You can expose them to the things you like, and they might find they like the same things. Or they may find a different path. They are, after all, fully realized human beings. If you force them into your idea of ""success,"" they may do very well at it. But they may also resent the fuck out of you for it. Is that worth it to get your ""second chance"" at doing better at the things you loved?"

My then boyfriend (now ex, broke up late 2017) and I were together only a few months then, and he knew I wanted to go through med school really bad. Was studying very hard for it. He called me saying he wanted to talk, so we met somewhere and he started asking me if I was sure I wanted to do it. 

He kept saying that 1) he couldn't see me as a doctor, or slightly imagine me in such a position. 2) I wouldn't be a good wife or mother if I decided to be a good doctor, and I wouldn't be a good doctor if I wanted to be a good mother/wife. 

I couldn't even say anything or answer him at the time. I just sit there and cried (I promise I have grown a spine since then), and he couldn't understand at all why I was hurt. He thought his reasonings were legit and I couldn't be so sensitive to be hurt by that. 

Occasionally I dropped the boyfriend, and currently in med school. The relationship lasted about 2 years and there were a lot more stories and gaslighting like that. This is one of the three things that still stuck to me this day. "

I would have normally passed this off as just a similar situation, but it was a very specific situation, with very specific details, that he nailed. He even quoted things I actually said to the officer. I never called him on it but my buddy and I got a huge laugh out of it after he left the room. "

"There's a reason sexual violence is left out of the books, and honestly out of most fantasy fiction. It was a very real thing in the time period fantasy settings are often loosely based on, but we are suspending disbelief already by acknowledging multiple humanoid sapient species, dragons and fucking magic. I don't really see any reason, even in a game with essentially a parental advisory sticker for mature content agreed to by all participants for rape and sexual violence to be portrayed in any graphic sense. In a more ""gritty"" world it could be a known consequence of the sacking of cities and such, but detail is unnecessary and usually just awkward and out of place. There are a few examples where the existence of rape being acknowledged could make for a good story point; a baby born after the sack of a city during which there were rapes by the conquering force could be a sub-plot, whether its the citizens being angry at the mother for keeping said child, or the inverse with the mother wanting to get rid of the baby, whatever the case may be and the only other example I can think of, that handled with care, could work is the party has helped take a city and is preventing soldiers from ""sacking"" it to their hearts content and will either put themselves directly at odds with the rank and file in direct confrontation or politic with the higher ups to convince them to act. I'm sure there are other mature uses where these things could be portrayed as a piece of backstory or motivation or other story telling tool, but I have never encountered a story of random rape descriptions and especially with a character involved being anything other than someones horror story about a terrible game. Essentially at its best its a distasteful shock technique, and any use is touchy, but direct use is ham fisted, often childish and really should be avoided."

"My sister lives close to my parents (~20 min drive) and pretty far from me (10hr drive). She accidentally locked her phone and keys in the car while at the grocery store one day. Our dad tends to overreact about stuff like that, and lectures us on how we need to be more careful (I got a 30 minute lecture when I left my headlights on and my car died once). He’s very nice and a great dad, he’s just protective and thinks making mistakes like that is dangerous. Anyway, rather than use the store’s phone to call my parents for the spare key, she called me while I was 10 hours away. I called the non-emergency number at her local police, gave them her car info, they came and unlocked her car, and we never told our dad. It’s been several years. We told our mom eventually and she thought it was funny just because my sister and I are so serious about keeping the secret. "

What?!? Yea she was pissed but it was already broken. You could tell by the exploded capacitors and fun blackening around the circuit board. She was still pissed.

Also, apparently, people living stateside don't do bomb drills. That sunk in after a while, but even then it makes me feel like so many in the U.S. live in a microcosm...

Every time these countries with waaaaay much more bad shit going on every week stop and respect the loss of 9/11 I just feel... Empty. And sad. Their trauma and hardship is barely considered by the average US citizen.  

I don't mean to be uppity, but we switched churches at one point. Why? The previous one was bombed.  This. Is. LITERALLY. Daily life for people too many places. Yet here people in the U.S. that were never really harmed, or even knew someone who knew someone who was harmed act like one of their limbs was cut off. Oh, the atrocity. Wailing and moaning.  

I do not belittle those that died that day, nor their families grief. I don't make light the toll on the citizens and responders to the attacks. It is a hard thing, harder than I would like to imagine. The world can be a scary place -- and who the hell would do bomb drills in America?

No, it's these people who have no CLUE what life is like other places, this fear that 9/11 is the worst possible atrocity, this DEMAND that the rest of the world pay repsects for the loss that sickens me.  If only the average US citizen were so sensitive to the losses going on in other countries.

He didn’t realize that was what was making her more attractive to him but that’s what it was.

"To be fair on this, quite a few women have had it drillled into their head that having any sort of tummy rolls or body fat makes them overweight and unattractive. 


Sometimes to incredible degrees. I'd likely not believe you if you told me that there was nothing wrong with my weight. On a logical level I know I'm not fat. But I feel like I am because I was being called fat and shamed about eating food by my own mother from age 11 onwards. I was was an underweight beanpole of a kid, my arms and legs looked they'd snap in half if the wind blew too hard. My knees and elbows stuck out bizarrely. The photos are a jarring contrast between how I actually looked, and how I remember looking.

It later came out that mum was insanely jealous (seriously, I'm not exaggerating) - she's a thin athletic woman with zero curves, I started turning noticeably curvy as a pre-teen, and it was later made known that she incredibly mad because that was the body shape she had always wanted. She dealt with this by turning said body shape as negative as possible - if I hated it and thought I was an overweight flabby monster, and that her body shape was the only ideal, then she was clearly superior. She needed me to hate myself so that she could feel secure about her own body image issues.


Even knowing all that as an adult doesn't undo all of that damage - seeing photos of myself now is always an unnerving reminder that I do not have an accurate idea of my own bodyweight. I might not be obese, but you try explaining that to my brain sometime. I have made myself understand on a logic level...

But I still see the same fat girl in the mirror every morning when I check how I'm looking."
"The people discriminating against you because you're white are racists. Let's just get that out of the way.


Now imagine the penis size insecurity thing... Imagine if every time you went out, you made sure to wear clothes that accentuate the size of your junk. You made sure your pants were tight, and maybe wear ""enhancing underwear"", just so you don't feel that insecurity. Plus a good majority of men wear the same thing, and you want to be on the same level as them. (It used to be that way with codpieces). And then one day you decide to just wear baggy pants, you get a bunch of women saying ""ew, how unattractive, I feel dry every time I look at you. I don't know why you even wear that"". But fuck it, you're tired of feeling insecure and trying to appeal to them and society's expectations, even if not wearing it makes you feel insecure in a different way now. That's more on the level of how it'd feel. 


As for the girls discussing your love life behind your back... That's based on who you choose to go to bed with. Some people can keep secrets, others don't. The principle is the same: people discussing the sex appeal of your body can and will make you feel very insecure about yourself. The difference is that you're talking about someone you personally chose and trusted compared to strangers in public."
"Greece or Italy. Historically quality of life tends to get better over time, and modern day life is the best. I want to live somewhere where I would either live well in the ancient world, be OK and chill after that, or worst case scenario be living in an economically fucked up country but in the modern world and with an EU passport.

If I end up pre-ancient world then I wanted to pick Africa and avoid being somewhere 100% alone, but that’s a really high risk strategy in every other way.

Anywhere with a native population that got taken over like Australia or the U.S. is also hit and miss. Before colonisation is good, modern day is great, but land somewhere in the middle and it could be messy."

"That’s a big part of it I’ve seen.  This whole, “I can still get a piece of pussy” mentality is a very masculine idea, although I’ve known several women who think that way too, albeit with dick.  It’s juvenile and pathetic, and some people just can grow out of it.  "
"&gt;Who knows? Maybe!

This is where I lost it. I can feel the frantic exasperation and the sense of slowly losing your sanity through mindless fear and exhaustion. I just lost my shit here.

This reminded me of something that happened to me.

I once spent about 4 hours weeding beans with a friend at their grandparents. Their grandpa had asked us in the car ride over if we wanted to make a little money. 7 year old me was ecstatic at the idea of pocket money and my brain filled with possibilities of what I could buy later. The 4 hours passed I was sweaty, filthy, sunburned and looked like a small, grubby third-world brickmaker, I was handed two quarters with great ceremony. My friend pocketed their quarters with delight and I didn't know what to say, but I was livid, bewildered and about to drop with exhaustion. 

I feel like we must have felt the same at the moment. "
"&gt; Hey it's okay to wear the same thing for more than a day if it's not smelly or dirty.

"I work for a privatized version of 911 for Doctors and Hospitals (we take other offices and businesses as well though). I had someone call in to one of our non-medical lines (It was a nearby city's emergency line for their sewage department) and try to schedule to have sex with me. At 2:27 in the morning. When I hung up, he called back 37 times. 

We also manage a property management company that is infamous to us (as dispatchers) for never picking up their fucking phones ever. As in, one of their apartments CAUGHT FIRE and it still took the maintenance guy four and a half hours to pick up the message. I had the NYC Board of Housing call in and demand the super's direct number, and I had to tell her that I didn't have it, however I could take a message and have him call her back. She threatened to sue me, and I told her that if she could convince a lawyer that the long-arm statute applied for someone out of state doing their job, then my name was FallOnThestars and she was free to do so. I also had a woman call in wanting me to send maintenance over at 3am to kill a centipede. Maintenance does not deal with any pests after hours, and I told her that. she bitched and moaned that it was big, and she was too scared to go in her apartment, and that she would withhold rent. I reiterated that maintenance did not deal with pests after hours, and told her to have a good day. I managed to not tell her to grow up and use her fucking shoe. "
"I mean, exercise is scientifically proven to release endorphins, which improves you mood, decreases stress etc. And objectively in terms of living, your body will be in better shape.

"There's a cat walk (about 4ft wide and the length of 1.5 football fields) that leads to the back of a middle school so kids don't have to walk a mile just to go around to the next block. It was lightly raining but no big deal as I had a hoodie. As I'm making my way down this dark (not a single light) cat walk, I see the shape of a torso dab-smack in the middle and much lower than if it was a person standing. Well that's creepy. Probably just a mannequin to scare some kids as a prank. But then I notice it's moving. It's the middle of the night. Good thing I have my Kabar knife. As I get closer (still a considerable distance but enough to notice changes in the silhouette) I notice that this thing looks like a human monster straight from 'The Thing.' It had multiple arms and I stood still. In shock. My heart was pounding so hard. I felt like this thing locked onto me and we were having a starting contest. I couldn't see a face, but there's no way that thing didn't see me. The way it moved was terrifying. I muster up some courage after standing there for a few seconds and press on; getting closer and closer. I clench my knife (still holstered but ready to go) and only notice what it actually was when I get to maybe 5ft away. I walked up from behind a teenage girl taking it doggy-style from a teenage boy on his knees. What a relief I felt. But then my inner cop came out and asked the girl if she was under duress and wanted me to take this kid down. She laughed, thanked me, and I kept on walking. Creepiest thing I've experienced on my night walks. "
"I feel like many people don't really know what they're talking about when they speak about muscle. Unless you are under 10% body fat, muscle is actually not that ""rock hard"" when relaxed.

But those are my tiger stripes and I'm proud of them. I don't care who sees them. I still wear a bikini because I can. I'm back to my original High School weight 4 Kids later and at 50 years old.

You cant just pick 2 states that are pretty much at opposing ends of the country and compare with 2 countries that share a border. Poland to Spain would be just as stupid for a weekend driving trip and a much fairer comparison.

Also states are different to countries, just because states can be bigger than countries does not make them the same thing. A lot of Americans have trouble with this."

I think I am not expressing myself well. I would never take a vacation without my wife. I love her more than life itself and I would sooner send her on a vacation alone than take one alone. I could not have done any of the things that I have in my life without her support and the frustration stems from not being able to provide her with the joy of experiencing a true vacation. She deserves to be pampered and have her whims catered to far more than I ever could.

That was pretty much my first date tactic too before I met her.  Offer to get the bill and when they offer to pay, just ask if they want to buy the next round at the next bar.  Presuming the date is going well so far, they'll agree and you can keep the night going."

"Sorry but that is a rather poor perspective and just utter nonsense . If I'm a psycho who gets happiness from murder or rape it's not okay because it's what makes me happy.  The purpose of a relationship is to make a deep lasting emotional connection, not to use the other person for self gain.  There's nothing wrong with wanting nice things but there's definitely a huge flaw in a person who prioritizes what they can get out of someone to justify being with them.  Even stepping away from an intimate example, if you had friends who only would hang out with you because you bought them shit and ditched you when you couldn't anyone would immediately tell you those aren't real friends and are just shitty people using you.

"Very anecdotal, but I have identical twin boys that are just shy of two. They had different personalities even in the womb (because they were twins and considered a high risk pregnancy, we had like 9 sonograms so we kind of got to watch them grow up before they were even born). They’re still very different, and their personalities mirror how they were prior to anything external from the womb. One is incredibly gregarious, loves meeting new people, smashes everything like he’s the Hulk, and generally bulrushes his way through life. The other is much more reserved, prefers playing with things that are more mechanical than toylike (like tongs, vacuum attachments, buttons, keys &amp; locks) to figure out how they work. They become frustrated and gleeful at totally different things, but react the same way to those differing stimuli , e.g. one will get mad if he’s restrained from playing with something dangerous that he just really, really wants, and the other will get mad if he’s playing with a container and can’t figure out how to get the lid on properly, but their reaction is the same...just a difference in what caused the reaction.

TLDR; I have identical twins not separated at birth who are very different even though they were never separated."

"I was also being woken up by my mom and in the 6th grade. My mom said “their making a movie in New York where these buildings get hit by planes”. She actually thought it was a filming of some action movie, me and my sister shared a room at the time watched the second plane hit and started screaming and my mom kept saying “it has to be a movie”. We got to class and there was fighter jets zooming passed every couple minutes. The city i live in at the time had top 5 largest oil fields in America and was supposedly on “the list” of next targets and we were under watch for maybe a week. One of my dads co-workers was on the plane and we didn’t know until a few days later when they were showing everyone’s name and picture on tv, it was such a terrible time. I was 11 years old at the time and had absolutely no idea about wars and terrorist attacks. It’s bitter sweet seeing the change in how easy it was to board planes from before then and now. Seeing the change in society from before and after was crazy, being half middle eastern and looking the part made me feel uneasy like i had never felt before at that age. What a weird time, it was also my sisters birthday. "
"A friend of mine lived under the path of SFO. They had triple paned windows but the jets taking off we're so loud they would still rattle. They said the silence was deafening. During the time when planes we're grounded, a random plane took off and it scared the shit out of them. Turns out it was military something going somewhere important, but still.  "
"they're on a fault line, all buildings must be built to withstand earthquakes"
Well I mean there is a lot of footage so I've seen it through that. It's hard to watch and hear the screams from the witnesses as the first plane hits. Can't imagine the horror felt by the people in America especially in the new york/Jersey where I am. My dad was working not too far from the world trade center on 9/11. I'll ask him about it tomorrow because I forgot what he told me about that day. I'm also brown in a Muslim family so it definitely affected me as a person. A day doesn't go by without me thinking about 9/11 even though I don't remember it.

"Moved halfway across the country to be with my then-girlfriend (now fiancee) and was also looking to pursue a more traditional teaching job after working as a dorm parent in an alternative boarding school for rich kids. I walked in to my first day at this therapeutic day school that was 100% special ed. I was the new middle school teacher they hired because they were growing very quickly, so my first day was already a few weeks into the school year.  


The principal was giving me a tour of the building. She brought me into one of the middle school classrooms, and 3 boys saw that I was new and screamed, ""GET HIS SHOES!"" So I had 3 fourth-grade boys attack my legs/feet. The act in and of itself wasn't intense, but the realization that I walked into a teaching job where kids didn't fear any consequences for doing that in front of the principal brought on an intense, ""what am I getting myself into?!"" feeling.  


I left that job less than a year later after a student sent me to the hospital twice. "

"My daughter dated a guy whose father left his family, started a new family and gave his new son the exact same name. They were both Asshole Shithead Jr. The kid had a messed up life for sure. However, he was emotionally abusive to my daughter. Always brought up his shitty dad and how it ruined his life and used this to manipulate my daughter. She went from a confident, intelligent person actively involved in extra curricular activities to an emotional train wreck that was crying all of the time and would never talk to us or her friends. He was always threatening to kill himself anytime she got anywhere near breaking up with him.

We finally got her to take advantage of the free counseling at her university and her doctor confirmed what we already knew. Asshole Shithead Jr was an emotionally abusive piece of shit. After two sessions with this wonderful psychiatrist, my daughter had broken up with him. She is back to her normal self with a much healthier outlook on what she should expect from a relationship.

University students- take advantage of the free counseling!

"When I was around seven years old, General Mills set up a little website where kids could play some basic online games and email their favorite cereal mascots. I was so distraught by those commercials that I wrote a long email to the Trix rabbit trying to give him some tips on how to get some goddamn Trix. I pleaded with the rabbit to just stop losing his mind halfway through every scheme and giving away the fact that he was a rabbit.

I needed him to get his head in the game. I needed the catharsis of seeing this poor creature get the cereal that so haunted him. I just wanted things to work out; work out for him, work out for me.

That motherfucking rabbit never took a single element of my advice. Fuck him, fuck those kids, and fuck Trix."

"Start by putting on the parking brake.  Pull out your jack, slid it under your car. There should be some metal bars, thats your cars chassis. Put the flat part under that and start pumping. Obviously on the side of the tire you are going to change.

If you were going under the car, you would use a device to hold up the car instead of relying on the jack's pressure. Now take your tire iron, and put it on your wheel's nuts. Some cars may have a hubcap that can just be pried off. Now, this takes some oof, and if you didn't use the parking brake, the car will make it harder by shifting.  Do this for each nut. Slide off the tire, slide on the spare. Tighten the nuts with the tire iron. Drive slowly (less then 60) to your nearest tire shop. Especially if your spare is not full sized(smaller diameter)."

"Radiologist working with ER imaging here. 

I have seem plenty weird stuff including:

- prison inmates fight, one comes over with a toothbrush sticked all the way into his ear

- girl arrive walking and complaining of being shoted in the head. Small wound at the back of her head, bloodied hair, normal neurologic tests. Turns out she was really shoted and the bullet transversed her cerebellum and stopped at the temporal bone.

- girl with psychiatric condition eats any small object near her. We have at least two dozen different exams of her. One time, he ate 3 pencils and a screw. Endoscopist found 2 pencils at her stomach and a lesion on her esophagus. The third pencil penetrated the esophagus wall and was stuck there. 

- seventh floor fall with broken legs and nothing more (failed suicide attempt...)

- old man with jaundice, MRI was inconclusive due to metal artifact. He reported being shoted in the belly when young, but says doctors removed the bullet. An xray and an old school cholangiogram show a fragment of the bullet in main bile duct. Probably migrate after years.

- lots of weird malformation on stillborns and newborns.

- this is non-surprising for doctors, but had 16yo girl underwent MRI due to absence of menstruation. She had testicles interested of ovaries (called androgen insensitivity syndrome, or Morris syndrome).

then i saw some of my more ""normal"" students some days when they forgot or chose not to take their meds. YIKES! some had manic episodes, some had unbelievable difficulty focusing on simple tasks, some just fell apart in various disturbing ways.

i still believe that medication is over-prescribed to young people in general, but i very much learned that it is essential for some to find a small measure of happiness, normalcy, and success.  most doctors are qualified and have their patients' best interests in mind."

"While there are a lot of word similarities between English and German, the grammar is, well, not the same. For example, the positions of verbs, case situations, the different suffixes for adjectives depending on the case, the passive voice, etc. can make German grammar a little confusing. 

Honestly, listening to German music is what helped me significantly (a lot of Rammstein) with my vocabulary. I also watched German newscasts. However, if you can practice with someone who is either a native German or speaks it fluently, that will serve you well.

&amp;nbsp;

People like myself with Aspergers struggle as it is, but more ""normal"" or as much as I hate the term, ""neurotypical"" people are feeling the strain and it's starting to show more and more often.

Especially with campaigns and awareness about some of the primary coping mechanisms people have gone to in the past, like smoking, alcohol, etc.

Combine that with less physical socialisation and interaction in public, like staying home and drinking, vs going to a pub and drinking, and I feel like it's leading to more and more isolation and less ability or willingness to vent.

Which then leads to more and more internalisation to the point of overload and people snap.

"&gt; If our ears were any more sensitive, we'd be able to hear the Brownian motion of the air molecules smashing together around us.

Our hearing is not very good compared to many other animals.

Our auditory processing is unimaginably better than anything else we've encountered though. Humans can accurately locate even a brief, quiet sound extremely accurately in a 3D space, and we do so near instantly. Most animals need to repeatedly reposition their head / reconfigure their ears across several instances of a sound in order to gain enough information to roughly locate it.

It's believed we are able to do this largely due to how sound of different frequencies and from different directions are reflected and otherwise influenced by the various folds on our outer ears, and our brains are able to use these minute differences to calculate exact 3D location (and much more).

We're so unbelievably good at this, if the shape of your ears were to suddenly change (or you were directly fed audio that passed through a different ear shape) your brain near instantly works out the new sound profiles and continue as thought nothing had changed.

Those trippy binaural recordings where you can hear crazy detail and tell precisely where every sound is coming from are made by literally sticking a pair of microphones in to a model of a human head with accurately molded ears."

"I had a female friend that I knew of from back home, but we didn't really hang out until we both ended up in a completely different state working for the same company. At first things were okay, she was kind of high maintenance, but we mostly got along.  
  
One night, we end up hanging out pretty late. One thing leads to another and we had sex. I wasn't looking for a relationship, but we hadn't really discussed it before sleeping together. When I let her know, she was upset. I didn't blame her, I did the asshole thing by waiting till after to tell her I didn't want a relationship.  
  
The next day I receive calls and text from a guy saying he's her brother, and he was going to drive 800 miles to come kick my ass. I explained to him that what happened was spontaneous, I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, and I apologized and eventually he gives up and I never had to talk to her again...  
  
Is how I wish this story ended.   
  
We start hanging out again, but things start to get weird after the first month. she keeps asking me to stay over late, tries to find excuses for me to ""catch her"" getting out of the shower, and tries to say she's comfortable with me seeing her naked, etc; but I keep insisting that I don't want a relationship, and I don't want to create an awkward situation by continuing to sleep with her.  It keeps getting more intense, she starts coercing me to sleep with her, and I've never been very strong willed, so I ended up doing it a couple more times... it was awful, even though I really didn't want to have sex with her, she would make me feel guilty, or make it seem like I couldn't leave until I did. For some reason, that would work and I would continue to let her manipulate for the next few months.  
  
When I finally had enough, I left the country for a month to get away from everything. I didn't tell her I was going, I didn't tell anybody when I'd be getting back, and I didn't post anything on social media about it. When I return from my trip, I turned on my phone and within 60 seconds my phone is ringing. It was her. I was gone for an entire month, and either she had been calling every so often for the last month, or she knew exactly when my plane landed. I just turn it back off and go home, take a nap for a few hours and go to work for a 12 hour shift.  
  
After I clock out at 4am, I start walking out to my car in the middle of a mostly empty parking lot and see another car parked right next to mine.  **It's her.** I immediately turn around and alert security, who alerts the police.  They pull her over as she tries to escape the lot and for 20 minutes the cop explains to her that she isn't to contact me any more.  She just keeps asking if she can talk to me for a second, repeatedly.  Finally she gets in her car and leaves.  I receive one more call, but that was it.  No more calls.  
  
The next day I talk to my roommate about my night/morning, and she gives me the description of this **same** girl, and says that she came to the apartment and ask for me the day before and said we were supposed to hang out. *This was at 5pm.* My roommate told her I was at work, and she said thank you and left.  **SHE THEN DROVE TO WORK AND WAITED FOR ME FOR TEN+ GODDAMN HOURS.** "

"A friend of mine, his mother spoke to him as he was getting married, and said 'there's going to come a time when you have to choose between your wife and me, choose her because I'll always love you'.  

That's not to say take your parental relationships for granted, but your priority is your spouse.  When you marry, you give yourself to your spouse.  Your spousal relationship, if you want it to work, should always come before your family, and your friends.  There are obviously exceptional cases such as illness, etc.  But across the board...when you give yourself to one another, they are your family, your 1st family.  That becomes your primary relationship.  You cannot serve two masters, especially when one of those masters is the living, breathing personification of Marie Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond.  

In my situation I made the mistake once(we weren't even married at the time) of putting my family's needs in front of hers and she still lets me have it about that to this day...that was 19 yrs ago.  Every day is consumed with her consuming herself with her mother and sister.  I get the time and energy that's left over.  I didn't sign up for that.

"Nowhere did I say I wanted to just not have a job and contribute nothing.

This is all about changing the absurd norm of having to work 40 hours a week, which sucks the life out of many people. Congratulations on that not being the case for you. Many aren't so lucky. Or maybe that does describe you, and you just think everyone else should have to be as miserable as you are. 

""You don't have to work 60 hours weeks if you don't want to. There are plenty of jobs out there, especially now.""

No, there aren't. And that is what I originally said. If you want to work 20 or 30 hours a week and just get by on less, jobs like that don't exist UNLESS you drop down and get a minimum wage type job or slightly better. At which point that is not feasible.

I'm not shitting on capitalism or conservatism. I am a conservative myself, yet you're talking to me like I'm a communist. All we are talking about is changing the amount of work that is expected of people. Not redistributing wealth. We are talking about increasing people's overall happiness, which in turn will increase productivity at work, and lead to more job opportunities for more people. 

You're basically just saying ""shut up, you're wrong. Stick to the status quo because it worked for me, so anyone who works as hard as me can make it work too. Anyone who doesn't is a lazy fuck."" What good does that do anyone? That doesn't change the reality of the situations people are in that you clearly have never even tried to empathize with.

"I make $9.50/hr, if my son gets sick, or has to come home for any reason, I am not allowed to leave work. I have to find a sitter, or my husband has to take PTO. (Taking PTO will cancel out any overtime worked. He will be paid regular wage for overtime.) My husband makes $30/hr, is on the cusp of a promotion that will garner him a significant raise, and is close to being done with school, which means more raises.

In the three weeks my son was in daycare my husband had to call off work twice, and we had to pay a sitter once. We pay our sitter $10/hr so I paid her everything I made that day, plus an extra $5. 

If my husband had to continue to call in, he would have lost his job. 

On top of everything else, our gas bill tripled. 

By the time we were done paying for extra gas, paying a sitter, paying for the doctor bills when my son brought home yet another illness, losing out on overtime money for my husband's work, and getting dinner out twice a week on the days we both got home far too late to cook, but our son needed to be to daycare at 6am, we were losing money."

"The problem with these questions is it inevitably becomes Democrats telling other Democrats what Republicans actually think in the most negative ways possible without bothering to consult any Republicans themselves to actually hear their response.  For this reason there are a lot of terrible answers here that just aren't really based on anything more than Democrats not liking Republican views.

The real issue is that the majority of the United States doesn't want to deal with the absurd (from an American's point of view) wait times that comes with universal healthcare.  

Canada, Europe, Australia, etc. all purposefully make it difficult to access their universal healthcare to keep costs down.  It's a ""feature"" that doesn't really exist in the United States.  ""Wait time"" in the United States mostly means you have a 2:00 PM appointment with the doctor but he's running a little late and won't get to see you until 2:18 PM.  [As a Swede, it means you get diagnosed with a fucking hole in your heart but have to wait 18 months for the surgery to fix it](https://www.afp.com/en/news/2266/swedes-enjoy-world-class-healthcare-when-they-get-it-doc-18l33e1).  

Massachusetts has embarrassing ER wait times by American standards - total shit.  [At 38 minutes - minutes - the state ranks 49th out of 50 states.](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-flow/11-states-with-the-longest-er-wait-times-021517.html) The average wait time in Stockholm hospitals?  About 4 hours.

This is the issue.  This is where the conversation breaks down every single time.

Every decade or so a Democrat will float the topic.  Numbers will be crunched, studies will show that taxes will go up but out of pocket healthcare costs will go down maybe not enough to offset the increase in taxes but close enough for most people, there will be relatively high support, then the conversation turns to wait times and even the Democrats will balk at it.

This is the answer to your question OP.  It has nothing to do with Americans being stupid, hating poor people, etc.  Americans just don't want to need surgery but be told they have to wait 18 months.

EDIT: It's cool.  You can continue to down vote me.  This is still the answer though."

They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.

Those are his words.  Some *Mexicans* are *not* rapists, drug dealers/users, and criminals.  He did not say that some *illegal immigrants are*.

"Sorta reminds me of the episode of Episodes where Matt LeBlanc keeps trying to persuade Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig’s characters to change their main female character’s sexuality from lesbian to bisexual to leave open the possibility of them getting together, even though the whole point of humour was the fact that, because she was a lesbian, she was completely unobtainable by the main character, and later explains his reasoning that, even though it was his favourite part of the British show, the British show only had 24 episodes throughout its run, which is basically one season in America, and they need to leave open the possibility of a romantic storyline to follow if, three seasons in, they’re really struggling for new ideas. 

24 episode seasons and 6 to 10-season runs are way too long for a show. It stops being a hit and quickly becomes a cash cow. The Office, How I Met Your Mother and The Big Bang Theory all made this mistake."

Girls simply don't understand - can't even begin to comprehend - how fucking painful and cringy it is to get turned down over and over. Guys generally have to live with it and get used to it as a fact of life, but girls DON'T... So they internalize one or two bad experiences and never attempt it again.

"Very true. The club I worked at was really strict on no touching no funny business but there are other clubs on the island that were straight brothels practically. Men would get so mad about the bouncer in the room for the cheap dances and the camera for the champagne rooms. Go on back page if its such a problem creep! The guys who were insistent about the camera being there I would say it was there for their protection too, once they thought about it they were usually okay with it. The way they think they can treat you is disgusting. When I would come around to collect my tips and they would ask to touch my vagina. What makes you think I would let you do that for 1 dollar? One time a guy straight up back handed a girl off her bar stool when she asked him for a shot...after he had invited her over. I had a guy literally shove me across the room one time trying to prank his friend. And the ones that think they can make degrading comments about your body make me the most angry. Almost as angry as the guys who come in and think they can sit at the bar without ordering a drink or tipping any of the girls. Its not a free peep show."
Tl;dr don't go to Guatemala.
"My generalization is basically that men who need to spend big money for intimacy and attention cant get it in real life because they're undesirable because of their issues, so we get the worst of the worst. My club is a brothel basically and I'm in the minority of girls who dont fo extras. It's pretty wild. Management protects high paying abusive John's over us girls. We need more rights. 

The 1$ for touching vagina is asinine. I love it when men offer me some super low backpage type number for sex, like $200, and I can be like: ""baby, lap dances here are $40 for a 3 minute song, I can make $200 in 15 minutes for 5 songs without ever having to touch your cock"".

"This is not exactly true. It's just easier to record conversations with these always on smart speakers. If you consider a phone or a laptop with a microphone, sure they can also secretly record your conversations however, they have gone through enough scrutiny to not do this by default. The bad actors have to actually invest resources in making malware for your particular computer, infect it without your knowledge to siphon the data. Most generic people like us aren't worth the effort. We are just fishes in the dragnet and it's hard to stand out unless you fuck up majorly which sets them off. You can do a lot of illegal things without actually coming up on the radar. 

Now compare this situation to these always on smart devices. They can just insert one little backdoor in the OTA updates and boom, you can now listen to the entire country. Now start adding voice recognition, analysis etc, it turns into a potentially powerful weapon. 

To summarise, yes they have already been tracking you. Always on microphones installed in your houses made by companies with ulterior motives just made it super easier for them. "

"Making your bed is a popular one because of how quick, easy, and early it is.

You crawl out of bed super groggy, then you turn around and start straightening your sheets.

Blood flow increases from the active use of muscles that have been stagnant for the past 6-8 hours. You finish making the bed, step back, and enjoy the light endorphins from accomplishing a task. You are now awake and feel good about yourself.

It hasn't happened as much I hoped, but there are little corners here and there.

In my view, there needs to be more cultural (and material) support for those who want a simpler lifestyle.  As long as you're willing to do the work to care for your own basic shelter and earn enough to pay for food &amp; necessities, that's all that ought to matter.

I started getting feelings for a guy who was in a relationship and I didn’t say or do anything until he had 100% broken up with her (on his own terms and for his own reasons, with no influence from me). He did tell me later that he did have feelings for me too and that it was part of the reason he broke up with her, but he had no idea I had feelings for him until after.   

And also, I find it super unattractive if someone stays in a relationship “waiting” to see if someone else makes a move first. It just comes across as very cowardly to me and I wouldn’t want to date someone like that anyway (obviously if there’s an extreme situation like an abusive relationship that’s different). "
"It’s gross that they like to do something that inflicts pain and it should be a red flag that something isn’t right. But instead society condones it and too many people don’t have the brains to realize that they are nurturing something destructive. Nurturing sexual violence. Thinking that is sexy. Darkness is sneaky and it loves when people listen to others inviting them into darkness, assuring them it’s fine, it’s pleasurable, what could be wrong with that? It affects people negatively but they are blinded by their desire and only want to hear from others that it’s ok because they are afraid to confront their guilt. They try to validate each other. I see it all time on Reddit. Just because “everyone” says something is ok, doesn’t make it ok. 

I used to ask my husband to choke me during sex. He couldn’t bring himself to really do it. And now I have no desire for it, because I know what it is to have compassionate sex with a man who prefers it that way, and I realize I wanted abusive sex because that’s what I was told was hot until I accepted it as reality for myself. It wasn’t conscious. But that’s what porn has done to society...Blinded people before their own eyes . That’s why you can’t see that it laughs in your face while you defend it. "

It's like choosing to walk the scenic route to work, maybe through a park where you'll see a street performer, an ice cream van, a fountain full of coins. There might only be a slim chance you actually engage with any of those things. If not, it's just another tiny part of your day.

On the other hand, a musician getting 1,000 people to watch them perform on stage is much more significant."

"There's actually a lot more similar in rodents and humans than you might think, they're very good model organisms for a lot of diseases. I personally study the brain, and you might think a rat and human brain would be too far apart to be useful. But many of the systems in mammals evolved so long ago, and are so good at what they're needed for, that they're very well preserved without a major changes through many species. So cardiovascular system, muscles, respiratory system, and the nervous system and brain, all have common features in rodents and man. They can suffer many of the same diseases, with the same mechanisms as when humans have them.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, there are lots of problems with using rodents to study humans, but you have to balance lots of things - the closer you get to humans, the more ethical considerations there are, for example. Plus, the cost of using primates is huge compared to rodents. Does the benefit of experimenting on primates outweigh the ethical costs? Can the lab afford it? In many diseases we want to study, there'd be no huge improvement in the research to be gained. Primate work still goes on, but it has to be heavily justified to funding and ethics bodies (at least here in the EU). The principle we work on is to try and do as much as you can with as little use of animals. This means not using 50 rats if 10 is enough to test your hypothesis, and not using primates if you can get a meaningful result with rats."

One day a herd of cattle got loose and got on to the tracks which in turn caused the trains to stop at the crossing. Half the school was late because of it. The first few kids that trickled in got tardys or whatever it was. They tried to explain it, but they were met with ""suuuure that's why you're late"". After about 100 more kids came in with the exact same story they decided to excuse everyone who was ""late due to cows"" that morning. "

"It's reasonable to assume that players can lose track of everything going on in a game, and not consider the fact that they forgot to specify what they did with the thing in their hands when they choose to do something else. The character in the game however would have a hard time not noticing that they are literally carrying FIRE. So asking the player what they want to do with the torch should be standard procedure for anything but a rather hardcore game, and in those games giving a perception or perhaps an intelligence? roll before either letting him burn on a fail or asking the question of what to do with the torch on a succeed. 

players get excited and fail to think properly when the characters might not have. A player's excitement and forgetfulness shouldn't be equivalent to the character's.

The strangest experience I've ever had was actually when I met my girlfriend's (at the time) parents.

I was terrified to meet them, so I tried my best to dress well, and thought over topics in my head that they might bring up. I knew from TV and books that I should expect the frostiest welcome possible, and that I would have to be on my guard in giving proper answers and having perfect manners. My own experience with my Korean family (her family was also Korean) told me that I would have to respect a lot of different traditions and be as polite as possible to get any level of respect.

What happened was nothing I could have prepared myself for.

At first, things went as I expected.
We went to eat dinner outside, and I got the questions I had prepared myself for from her father - what school I went to, what I planned to do in college (I was a senior in college), where I lived, what my parents did.

Then he asked me why I wanted to date his daughter. At this point, I don't know what my response was, but I was not ready to answer that, and I swear all the liquid in my mouth must have passed through my ass to pave the way for the bricks that were coming out.

Whatever answer I gave, he smiled at me, and told me not to take it so seriously. I tried my best to maintain my expression, but my jaw went a little slack before I closed my mouth. He told me to enjoy myself, and to not take things so seriously at this point in life in general - that there was a lot ahead in life, and things I shouldn't have to worry about yet. He basically gave me the go ahead to mess around with his daughter and break up with her without any threat of him gunning me down like I had envisaged what any father would do in that situation. I think he could tell that I had not been expecting any of that, since he seemed to be smiling wider.

At this point, I was very confused. This was not what I had prepared for in any sort of way. A warm and honest conversation about life? I'd never had that with my own father or my family in any way.

Then he asked me what my relationship with my father was like.

Many different memories rushed through my head at that moment. Some of it tinged with red, most of it with this blackness from being hidden away in the recesses of my mind. There were a lot of moments in there that shared a common theme. I was sitting somewhere, watching as sobs rattled my mom's body.

My father wasn't particularly abusive or violent beyond normal Korean traditions. I'm sure there was a moment or two where he had slapped my mother, but that was far from the norm. He beat me, often, since I wasn't an obedient kid, but that was the norm for a Korean family. He was as cold and removed from my personal interests and life as an asian father often was, and his main concern was beating good grades and a MD out of me - but again, that wasn't particularly heinous or unusual. 

No, my father was a coward.

Of course, I didn't say that. I instead vaguely said that my father and I weren't close, and that he wanted me to do well in school.

At this point, to my surprise, my girlfriend's old man scolded me, but not in the way that I expected from another asian father. He asked me to consider the hardships my father had been through, and how his own father probably treated him the same way. He told me that he didn't know love any other way. I'd never been so gently scolded in my life - he even smiled again afterwards.

I stayed silent, mainly because I knew it wasn't the time or place to bring up my family's history - no need for the sordid details, but also because I wasn't sure how to react. A thought was ringing in my head - *this is how a good dad should act*.

Our conversation continued like that, a mostly warm flow where I felt like I could be as honest as I could with a stranger, and not feel like I was walking on thin ice that could sudden submerge me in freezing water. It was a stark contrast with my own interactions with my father and family.

The strangest experience I've had with a girlfriend's parent is realizing what it's like being a part of a functional and empathetic family. Eventually, I did end up breaking up with my then girlfriend, for stupid and trivial reasons. But I always remember that interaction I had with her dad. In that moment in my life, in that one interaction, I think he filled a vacuum that had been left by my own father.

I still think about that a lot, and harbor guilt because I never did get to thank him."

There are cheaper alternatives out there. You could go to community college or a smaller public school for much cheaper than that. Wouldn’t that be better than being in debt all your life?  

You could also not go to college at all. Working a job where you don’t make a lot of money would be equivalent to a job where you make money but are forever in debt.  I guess this makes sense a little if you want a highly specialized job that absolutely requires a degree, but still there are way better prices out there.

"This is eerily similar to my experience, because I was also in 9th grade in a NJ suburb of NYC (in 2nd period English, though). The whole day was so strange and surreal. Some teachers tried to carry on a little bit, but most just had the TVs going, and students were crying in the hallway trying to call their parents (it was before everyone had cell phones so everyone was borrowing from the kids who did) and mostly not getting through because 9/11 fucked up the reception so much so everyone was freaking out even if their parents were in midtown. My Spanish teacher used our class as a therapy session while she basically had a panic attack. You could go outside to the big hill in town and see the smoking skyline... And I vividly remember watching the news and seeing basically the same segment and footage over and over again because they weren't getting new information all that quickly so we just watched the towers collapse over and over... 

I found out later that the dad of the family I babysat for worked in the 2nd tower but made it out and survived. Thank god. He was an extremely nice guy."

"I was up at 2 or 3 in the morning when I heard rustling out by my trashcan. I peaked out my windows to see what the noise was, and I saw a woman going through my trash.

My immediate concern was that she was looking for documents she could use to steal my identity, so I went outside and confronted her. When I got closer I could see that she was homeless- dirty face, ragged and ill-fitting clothes, etc. This coupled with the fact that she didn't run away made me think she was looking for something to eat, and not looking for documents.

I asked her if she needed food, and she replied in Spanish. I don't speak Spanish, and she doesn't speak English. So I mimed eating food- only my sleep deprived brain decided that the best food to mime eating was definitely a banana.

The look of suspicion she shot me after was enough to make me realize my error. I had just inadvertently mimed sucking cock to her. After midnight. Right outside of my house. With no witnesses in sight.

She started to back away, and I said the only Spanish I knew, ""uno momento, por favor."" But my tone was that of a man pleading for her not to go- because I didn't want her to go. I wanted to go into my house, and bring her some food so the misunderstanding could be resolved.

Unsurprisingly, she wasn't there when I came back outside."

"The rest of the world doesn't have nearly half of all privatized guns. What works there probably won't work here. Let's take everyone's favorite gun control love story, Australia. Australia at the time of their buy back had 17 guns per 100 people. The US had 91 per 100. Pretending like these countries are similar in anyway related to gun control is, well, pretending. Furthermore, gun control is not always a success story. Take Canada and Mexico for example. You can own plenty of guns in Canada that you can own in the US. ARs, AKs, SKSs, Tavors, ect..  all available to the Canadian gun owner. Mexico, you can own a select few rifles and a handgun no bigger in caliber than a .380, also, there is only one gun store in Mexico and it's government run. Canada has more guns available to the public. Which would you rather live in? Mexico or Canada?"

The second time I remember my mother telling me if I kept doing it, both her and my father would be put in jail and ""they"" (the police, I guess?) would take the house we lived in and I'd be homeless.

So then I became terrified of doing anything wrong or thought I'd end up homeless with both parents in jail."

"I disagree. The videos you posted show idiots and assholes, and that type of person should be avoided.

But to me (a veteran) it's not about hero worship. I don't like talking about my veteran status even though I deployed and was discharged honorably after completing my full contract. I get very uncomfortable when people thank me for my service. I never use my veteran status in an argument or discussion about politics or foreign affairs, unless it directly relates to my personal experience or training I received through the military. (Although one time I shut down the obnoxious co-worker who knows everything when he started running his mouth about weapon systems, and that was frankly amazing.)

I don't think anyone should worship veterans, and there are many reasons for that. We probably agree on them. But people do give veterans a certain (undeserved, imho) level of respect and deference when you're out in public. This is related to America's worship of the military industrial complex, which is itself a problem but a separate subject.

So, my point here is, it's bad enough when a servicemember walks around in uniform in public. It's against policy but people do it anyway, and sometimes they do it because they enjoy the way they're treated.

But when someone who hasn't made any personal sacrifices wants to be treated that way... that's even shittier. Nobody deserves the treatment soldiers get. But people who never served deserve it even less.

And this is just about people walking around town in uniform. It doesn't even touch on things like wearing tank or awards you didn't earn (this is a big one for me, because those things one does legitimately *earn* and they deserve recognition for them.) Or, even worse, people who claim something like a purple heart aka ""Enemy Marksmanship Badge,"" or a silver star, despite not earning them. That's just beyond shitty.

Edit: also I get annoyed at people who wear a uniform improperly. If you're going to wear the uniform, do it right, especially if you're faking it.

Also also, if you want to avoid the whole issue, just leave off the ""US Army"" (or whatever service) tape. That piece of cloth is what makes a uniform ""official"" versus just playing dress up. It's also the only thing I will actually talk to people about if I see them in person, because it makes your uniform a legal document."

"Sorry, I think we're misunderstanding each other.

If you're trying to say that the daughter has some responsibility for the situation as well, that's fair enough. I'm reacting to ""I hate to break it to you but your daughter is the problem here. Tim is Tim,"" which suggested, to me, that you felt that the daughter was the only one to blame.

&gt;Why does Tim need to be a better person when he can still get laid? What is his motivation to change his game up when the present survival stratagem yields positive results in what is our highest priority as animals? The answer is none because people like OP's daughter will accept him and his behavior will thusly be rewarded.

You can say the same thing for the daughter, though. What motivation does she have to be a better person when she can still get a mate, get laid, and procreate, since Tim accepts her and has awarded her behavior with these things?

While the biological imperatives of the daughter and Tim are being met, I doubt that it's enough for them to be happy with their situation.

OP is concerned about his daughter's happiness, like any parent, and thus wants to help her, even if she's currently resistant to it. I doubt many parents would write their kid out of the will, even if they have to cut them out of their lives temporarily, instead hoping that they will come to their senses, and offer some support to them when they do."
"It was my first week at In N Out, towards the end of the day I was asked to sweep the parking lot for any garbage.

“Fuck, not again” the manager says *The fuck you mean not again* He tells me to go outside and if I see the car owner, to carefully let them know.

"Randomly walking off to collect a box of data that that in best case, would allow them to start a civilisation on a planet right next to a black hole which dilates time so that 100 years on the planet would be about six million years in neighbouring space, massively increasing the likelyhood that they would be wiped out by a natural disaster (like a star exploding or something) and making it extremely impractical to go on any further (possible necessary) space journeys. Not to mention the risk to the current mission and the completely randomised chance that said random walk in a random direction would yield anything of value. I really hate Anne Hathaway sometimes."

"I think you're totally wrong on this one. We say we're Americans because that is the name for us.

Go anywhere in the world and American means someone from the USA. Functionally, an 'American' is only someone from the USA. Fill out any government form or buy an airplane ticket in any country and American is our nationality.

If people say they're a North, South, or Central American, that makes sense. But just saying you're American means from the USA. You might not like that definition but that's how it is in the real world."

"Event Horizon is basically unofficially accepted as the first time a ship entered the warp. Big E would have been around somewhere during that time, but not as the Emperor (He only revealed his true nature and identity in the 31st millenia.....26,000 years after Event Horizon).

But it really does make sense too given that everything during and previous to the Dark Age of Technology is basically just understood as myth and legend, with an added layer of propaganda thrown on top since we only learn about it via IoM sources.

This life is too short to be trying to live it the way others think you should. We are all different people and that is what makes humans so beautiful- the diversity- the fact that some of us want to be preppy while others want to be goth and still others want to be tree hugging, flower giving, barefoot hippies! If the young people stopping caring what others thought then eventually the impetus for bullying would lose its power, and wouldn’t that be awesome?

"Whoa, slow down there. Who is pressuring anyone? This is just my personal experience, and it speaks to the fact that the best way to get to know people is to learn how to approach them. The only way I've learned how to do that is to just start by being okay with being bad at approaching people. It's a skill like any other and the only way to develop it is to just go do it regardless of a little embarassment. Anything you do 10 times you will be better at, but I see a lot of people be seized by the potential of being embarrassed or having someone tell you ""no"", myself included at one point 

What if you dont know very many women? How are you supposed to find out what you are genuinely interested in unless you meet some? How are you supposed to get to know people without asking to open the lines of communication? Also, this advice doesn't just work for meeting women, I just happened to tailor my advice for a context that was regarding difficulty meeting women. This works with pretty much any friends. How do you know if you genuinely like them until you have an open line of communication with them?

Why do you assume I'm measuring a man's worth by the number of phone numbers they get? In fact, my advice seems to suggest the opposite and acknowledges that most people in the world are not going to be people you are interested in, or that are interested in you, so the onus is on you to find the people with reciprocal interest. The very nature of the advice is to go out and ask 10 women for their number *with the expectation of rejection*. The whole idea is to demonstrate that ""no"" happens, and there are plenty of other people to be friendly with who might see something else in you.

I'm not stopping anyone one from doing what they want, just adding my 2 cents because I also used to be extremely anxious and neurotic in social situations, and that is how I found to face it. My fear was rejection, so I found a game to slowly overcome that. I dont see it any different than slowly approaching an elevator if that is your phonia. I've met a lot of great people that way, both men and women.

Also, I find it very interesting that you are so dismissive of this approach as ""toxic PUA nonsense"". From my experience, the PUA community is just about luring girls in with mind games and pathetic lines in an attempt to just have sex with them. I'm not talking about sex, I'm talking about relationships, and not even just romantic ones. I'm not saying to go out and get 10 girls numbers so you can just go fuck them. It's a first step in just immersing themselves in a fair bit of rejection so that they get out of their own heads and realize that being rejected publicly isnt the end of the world. It's a simple matter of expectations, and changing your frame of mind.

I also like how you conveniently swept passed my advice to take time to yourself to develop a bit before trying to get back out there. Most people are highly suspicious of people who dont really have any substance to their character. This is characteristic of the PUA types who have 1 dimensional personalities and only want one thing from you. Developing interests is not only good for developing relationships, but it's also good for your mental and physical health. 

I'm really curious why you reacted to my advice the way you did. At the core, the advice really is the best way to meet people is to just go meet people and not worry about embarrassing yourself. You'll do less of it over time, and the people who tell you ""no"" are not going to matter to you in the long run. Those are just not the people for you. What you will remember are the great memories you get from the few who say yes, and overcoming a previously constraining fear. You turned it into something else entirely. Really says more about you than me."
Were these actual real slang terms?  My friends used to use it ironically but I've never heard anyone say it seriously.

"[There’s some interesting work going on in the field of psychology regarding the moral roots of political belief.](https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind/up-next#t-1083454)

My take on why things have gotten so scary is that all of the mechanisms the founders put into our constitution to blunt the tyranny of the majority (the plebs who wouldn’t tolerate a highly inequitable society basically), are being heavily manipulated today giving far more political power to a minority of people than they should have. And, people in the middle of the moral spectrum (people who respect authority and in-group loyalty more than a liberal, but not as much as a conservative) will shift to the right when they feel threatened, be that from worsening economic conditions or major demographic shifts.

Who would have guessed that people with more liberal tendencies would concentrate in cities in a modern, highly mobile world? And who would have guessed that highly accurate voting data could be fed into complex computer models to draw perfectly gerrymandered political districts? Liberals and conservatives used to just have to live side by side, and now they don’t have to, and it’s mucking things up."

See a therapist. You'll know after 2-3 meetings if it's a good one. A good one will give you coping tools, homework, journalling, etc. A bad one will sit there and just talk to you. You have friends and family that can just talk to you, and you don't need to pay them.  Unload on your friends when you need to. They're there for you. Be real with yourself. You won't get over it in 6 months. It's a loss that stays with you forever.  


I found that my journey was lonely. In a few months people stop checking in on you. That doesn't mean they don't care. Lean on your friends and family. Tell them. Even if you have nothing new to add to the same things you've said a dozen times, say, ""You know, I'm still having a hard time getting up in the AM, finding a reason to go to class"" etc.  They will help.  Don't let negative thinking overcome you. Your journey is to overcome, become stronger and more optimistic.  


Be easy on yourself.  


Above all, know that things get better. Have hope. It may take lot longer than you might think it should, but there is an end. It doesn't come quickly or easily and for that I am so sorry. Honor your father by living your life in a way that honors the best version of yourself that he saw in you.

For any fans of Hey Arnold who haven't seen the new movie yet, [The Jungle Movie,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMiE3yekxz8) which is the movie that was supposed to come out 15 years ago and wrapped up the cliffhangers the original series was left on, was released in November 2017 and you can get it for $5 on Amazon, Youtube, Vudu and iTunes, and the DVD is available on Amazon. And now on this new [Ultimate Collection](http://thegeekiary.com/hey-arnold-ultimate-collection/55576) version too that will be coming out in November this year.

A petition for a 6th season is going on now.

https://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/912/288/796/

Petitioning worked in getting The Jungle Movie made after all these years. Fans were even [thanked](https://imgur.com/a/POCKw) in the credits of the movie because of it. Craig Bartlett, the show's creator, really wants to do a new season, as does the rest of his team, to continue from where The Jungle Movie left off.

**The petition has reached and gone over its original 15,000 goal (which is what the original petition for The Jungle Movie had) and the goal has recently been upped to 20,000 now, which should be the last time it is raised before the petition is sent off. The petition currently has over 16,000 signatures. Every signature helps.** 

The creators of the petition are also giving the option for people to send them 1 page written letters (explaining why you want a 6th season) and/or Fan Art, to be sent with the petition, if anyone is interested.

It was recently [said](http://tunestoons.mostlyharmless.libsynpro.com/ep-25-jim-lang-hey-arnold) (49 minutes into the podcast) by Jim Lang (the series' composer) that while The Jungle Movie ""totally killed"" and did really great in ratings with the original fans and had millions and millions of viewers, they weren't Nickelodeon's target age audience, who did not have the same ratings, so Nickelodeon has decided not to go ahead with season 6. 

**But he says that season 6 is now currently being shopped to video-on-demand services like Netflix, Amazon and Apple and others.**

Since this news has been released, the petition has been picking up speed and has gotten around 2000 signatures in the last two weeks.

This could actually be great news rather than bad that Nickelodeon decided not to do Season 6, as the show would likely do much better this way, with easier viewing and a larger audience and ages, as well as possibly allow them more creative freedom. It could also possibly open the door down the line for the teenage Hey Arnold spin-off series Craig Bartlett planned to do in the early 2000's that Nickelodeon turned down because it was too dark for them.

**Fans of the series should help out and request Hey Arnold Season 6 here:**

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest 

**where you can request TV shows from Netflix and get their attention and show the fan demand for it. If you do, be sure to mention season 6 specifically. Also tagging them and other video on demand services (like Hulu, who already has the original Hey Arnold series and so might be even more likely to pick up season 6 than Netflix or others) on Twitter and talking about it on social media will help too.** 

**If they all get a lot of requests, they will be more likely to do it then. Spread the Netflix and Petition link around to other fans you know too! :) Fans need to be persistent about this. As well as keep the news going around on social media.** 

Signing the petition for Nickelodeon will still help too because the people running the petition said it is going to be sent to Netflix, Hulu and possibly others as well, not just Nick. "

"My freshman year in college, my roommate was a nursing student whose family had really high expectations for her. She spent way too much time studying and would get really stressed out about exams. She pulled quite a few all-nighters, and although she would sometimes tease me about not trying as hard I think she was a little put off by how I wasn't as stressed as her. One night, before a huge exam, she woke me up crying and said she felt sick, like she was going to pass out. I got out of bed and forced her to get some sleep. I think it was five in the morning and her alarm usually went off at six, so I said she needed to power nap until then and then she could go to her exam. I was really worried about her health though and I didn't know what to do, so I just sat by her bed for that hour to make sure she didn't start to have a seizure or something, and then I gently woke her up at 6am.

"Placing the entire blame on the British is nonsensical but so is absolving them of all of it. Historical evidence shows that pre-colonial and pre-medieval India had a relatively liberal stance on sexuality and same-sex relations, as did many other Classical cultures such as Greece, Rome, Japan, and China (China actually also blames the British to an extent but I don't know the details). 

That being said, intolerance most certainly existed to differing extents before the British ever came ashore. However, the British do get the blame for fostering that intolerance by imposing Victorian Christian morality on the legal and education systems. Remember that the British only provided education to an elite few (usually the highest caste), controlled what they learned, and appointed them to positions of power. 70 years is not a lot of time to cleanse 200-300 years of cultural distortion (more than 200 if you go back to Medieval times but that doesn't involve the British). 

As for why it took 70 years to abolish this law? In history we see that progressive movements tend to accompany periods of economic prosperity/growth. India spent decades trying to lift itself from the sorry economic state the British left it in and still is. India didn't liberalize its economy until 1991 because it distrusted the major western players. Only after liberalizing its economy did India start experiencing rapid growth. An increase in quality education and literacy rates also has been occurring since then. I think these are the major reasons why India is seeing many progressive movements now instead of 5, 10, 20 years ago like some developed western countries. 

From your other comment, ""If Britain can move on culturally and legally in 70 years, so can India."" Wow, I'm sorry, my brain.. just.... Comparing 1947 UK and 1947 India is incredibly disingenuous and borderline condescending. Given India's initial conditions in 1947, I and many other Indians I know are actually quite surprised this happened in 2018. A lot of us didn't expect it for another decade or two (other Indians expressed similar sentiments in the r/worldnews post). 

In my opinion, it's not ""What took you guys 70 years?"" but rather ""Wow, you did it in only 70 years!"" "
"I relate to this so much, like every single part of this comment. I'm at a point now where if I think this is happening I'll just ask ""Hey are you really interested in me, or are you just scared to say no? Cuz I get it, some guys go nuts from rejection, I promise I won't"". If even that gets an indirect response, I'll just assume they're not interested.

It really REALLY sucks that some people don't have the self-control to be mature about rejection, people like that make things shittier for everyone looking for a healthy relationship."

"I'm 19. This sentiment of ""we all thought that and were wrong"" seems crazy reductive. Conjecture of ""will the Cold War end the world?"", for example, is much less substantive than, say, extrapolating the trend of global warming. I think we're looking at our futures bleakly because there isn't much hope that the world doesn't:

1. Get overpopulated, which causes plenty of problems by itself

2. Continue on the global warming trend until it is nothing short of irreversible.

3. Achieve even worse wealth/resource distribution.

I won't claim that I really know, or that anyone my age could, but I think the ""doomsday"" feelings that kind of permeate my age group are much more substantive assumptions than some of the what-if questions that were asked when older generations were at our age."

I had an accident while moving a big antique mirror by myself at home. It broke and half of it fell onto my neck. It severed my jugular vein and I came within a few minutes of bleeding to death.

I was out camping with my family and there were kids running around everywhere. It was mid-afternoon and all the adults were preparing lunch. The fire was out for the most part but still had hot coals most of the kids were good around it except one 1 1/2 year old. I was roughhousing with the 4-year-olds about 30 yards from the fire when I catch the 1 1/2-year-old bolting for the fire looking like he wants to belly flop on top of it. His mom had taken her eye off him long enough for him to exploit the opportunity. He was to far for me to catch him before he got to the fire. His mom screams. I had one of those soft smooth plastic balls so I just chucked it at him hoping to get his attention so he would wave off. It hit him dead in the face and flat backed him. His mom ran over and picked him and then thanked me.

"What I absolutely hate, with a fucking passion; is the ""what, don't you know?"". 

Gave my GF my old phone, I wiped it but forgot to clear out the ""hidden"" folder.  She knows my passcode so its not like I was hiding anything from her.  Anyways their was a few pics from a previous relationship that were still on the phone because I had gotten a new one during that relationship and kind of forgot about them.

What upset her was I also had some porn on their, off the web.  One of the images was a 3 way GIF shot from a POV.  She assumed I was one of the people in the video and was so mad at me that I had lied to her about my sexual past.  

The thing is I had no idea what was wrong for 2 days.  I kept asking if everything was ok and she would say ""yeah"".  Finally when she did tell me, I asked her how come she wouldn't tell me something was wrong when I asked for 2 days straight and her response was...

""You obviously knew something was wrong, or you wouldn't have kept asking!""

Then was getting very upset that I didn't know what was wrong and we argued for like 10 minutes before she finally told me.  She kept on saying ""Oh, you don't know why I could possibly be upset!?"", ""Is their something you need to tell me?""

I was getting so mad at the games I told her I wasn't going to do this anymore and if she couldn't act like an adult and tell me what was wrong then I no longer gave a fuck.

I don't play games, if they ask if something is wrong I say no because nothing is wrong.  If I ask them if something is wrong, their is..even if they say no..but i have to WAIT and deal with the silence and attitude until they tell me what is wrong.

More of a relationship type rant then a ""first date"" or ""romcom rant"" but I think some of it stems from the constant failure of communication in those movies.  instead of talking about what upset them its these contrived assumptions and beating around the bush until FINALLY they realize ""hey, it wasn't really anything like I thought it was.  Becky is your cousin, how silly of me!"""

My phone is almost never in my hand and I know in the first few weeks of dating someone, in this era anyway, texting back and forth is apparently important to form a foundation. Which I get to an extent but it makes things harder when I'm rubbish in general with my phone. I just don't feel the need to be attached to it 24/7. Me not replying is never an indicator of how much I like a person, it is an indicator of how bad I am with my phone. If I like someone I'll let them know in person and I much prefer just to meet them and chat rather than talk over a phone. "
"Honestly when I hear of ultimatums I just think of the only time I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum regarding a very questionable “friend” who said something very rape-y in front of my mother’s husband at the time. I told him he needed to drop the “friend” or I was done. He didn’t, and I didn’t hold up on my ultimatum. Fast forward a couple years and this “friend” is homeless and I’m a naive sucker who allowed him to stay with us. He ended up using drugs in our home and making our lives a living hell for a month. Sometimes you should evaluate your friends when someone who loves you brings their bad behavior to your attention. Not saying this was your situation but I’ve seen this happen too often. "

"Dad reflexes are 100% a thing. No kids of my own but I’ve got two god sons, about two and one years old, who I see multiple times a week, and I’ve caught myself developing them lately. Last weekend they were playing and the two year old reached up onto the counter to grab a berry and knocked a 8” chef’s knife off the cutting board. 

I’ve spent the last eight years or so in food service so my reaction to a falling knife is always to get my hands and feet back and let it fall. 

On this occasion my spidey sense tingled and I managed to jump out of my chair, cross almost twelve feet of ground and grab the knife by the back of the blade in the fraction of a second between it starting to fall and almost skewering the one year old. 

I still don’t know how I did it. "

"This used to be me. I wanted a man to come and save me so bad. I found a boyfriend after a bit and I was convinced he would save me from  the ""terrors of life"". Well no. He raped me because I was smaller than him, and wayyy too young.

Then I thought the next guy would magically un-rape me. Nope. You can never depend on someone to fix things another person caused.

Now the only time I call people for support is when only they can fix a problem. Either they and I have an issue we need to find a solution to, or I'm lost and they can help me get to where I need to go. I call on the people who can actually help, but when I'm scared or sad, it's my job to fix it."
"Same. I've been trying to incorporate more adaptive habits into how I handle them (not leaving the screen until it's sent, for example), but some still slip through the cracks once in a while. Luckily the fella I'm dating and my family at least try to be understanding."

"I had the same situation. She'd tell her friends everything (in detail) and they'd tell their boyfriends. So I'd get teased and asked more specifics. When I mentioned to a guy that I was driving her to get her birth control, I got ""why are you telling them everything?"""

"Wal-Mart announced in early 2018, to great fanfare, that it was increasing the minimum wage it is paying all their workers to $11 an hour.  Everyone applauded Wal-Mart for being a good corporate citizen.  Wal-Mart did this for a variety of reasons, the first being that the labor market is tight and they couldn’t attract workers. 

The second reaason is that it didn’t cost them anything.  If you take out one time charges, you will see that their operating expenses (which includes salaries) has remained static over the last few years.  The accounts payable amount (the amount they owe to vendors who supply them goods) has increased every quarter. They are basically paying their vendors slower than normal. For example if they normally paid you in 60 days, now they do it in 90 days. This has a huge impact on cash flow and reduces the amount they have to borrow from the bank (and pay interest on), they are essentially getting free financing from their vendors who are struggling to pay their bills cuz Walmart is delaying payment to them.

Their success in football has allowed them to increase there enrollment by 15,000 students in the past ten years and increase the incoming freshman average ACT score by 3 points. Football has allowed them to grown, bring in better students and become a better university. While it's certainly an outlier, it does happen at other places. "

I came over the day after he got home to pack my stuff, he tries to rope me into another conversation to try to get me to stay ( we had been having a lot of issues, I had been coming to him/trying to repair things for months prior to the actual breakup ) so I wasnt having any of it. He only wanted me to stay and talk to try to convince me to not breakup. I forget the exact words said but eventually he gave me an ultimatum, either stay or go so I went. I did drive to the end of the street and sat at the stop sign to cry and calm myself for a bit, he walked up to my window and said he needed a broken, not working GPS I borrowed from a mutual friend to give back to said friend, so I gave it to him and he walked away. Once I was calm enough to drive, I did took off and never looked back.

He later messaged me over Facebook saying all he wanted was for me to turn around and come back. "

"I don't know if I'd call it abuse, but it is a violation of sorts. If a relationship was sexually active before marriage, and then a marriage happens and sex stops, the person who is no longer getting sex is not able to seek it elsewhere or else risk losing half their worldly possessions.

If one considers workplace mistreatment abuse, they'd have to consider this abuse as well, since in both cases the party in question is leveraging the power dynamics of their arrangement to force what they want out of another, but in both cases the victim can leave, though it is not costless to do so."

"Frozen vegetables are better than fresh vegetables because they are frozen so close to source so the level of nutrients (vitamins etc) is locked in. Fresh vegetables are typically hours old by the time of cooking so have already lost some of those nutrients.

"I also went on a Tinder date with Carmen Callaway a few years ago. She was already a porn star at that point, in semi-retirement, using a different name on Tinder, I’m guessing her birth name. 

The date didn’t go overly well. She didn’t want to talk about what she did for work, and was obviously very secretive about it. This led to a lot of awkward silences because she would start to tell a story and suddenly stop. 

This time, I can say I did have sex with her, but she didn’t give me a callback after that. 
She messaged me a couple days later, and told me she had a nice time, and enjoyed the sex, but was in a weird place and didn’t know if she wanted to go back to work. She told me I had a right to know, so she said I could look her up online and gave me the name “Carmen Callaway”. 

I googled the name and was pretty damn surprised. 
We followed each other on Twitter, and still talk from time to time, but I moved to Chicago and she still lives in Souther California. I have a girlfriend now, so I don’t really go out of my way to talk to Carmen anymore. She keeps getting back in and out of porn. She’s done a few films since I met her, but will drop back out. "

Kids need to socially transition at home first so they can try out a different gender identity without pressure from the outside. Doctors and therapists don't want parents to just cut their kids hair and give them new clothing and a new name and send to school where other kids can influence them into either going back when they are really trans or not to go back because they feel like they can't take their words back. It's a real process to go from trying it out at home to trying it out in public.
You now are in posession of a magic thumb that you should probably be careful where you have it pointed.

"I have three major stressors in my life - money, a stressful career, and an ex-wife who just isn't great when it comes to the way she is with the kids.

If money is no longer an issue, then the stressful career lightens up a lot, as I could stop dealing with any cases or clients except a selected few that really interested me. I wouldn't need to take on enough work to get so overwhelmed sometimes, I could hire a young attorney and train him or her up to create something great, and I could step back from the stressful day-to-day stuff.

That would just leave the ex - and enough time to try to find a way to apply the right pressure to calm her down, too.

Money would make a big difference in my life."

"Played a campaign with a sorcerer that specialized in illusions. After saving a town, he declared himself mayor (the NPCs did not agree to this) and cast Minor Illusion to create a mayor’s sash on him at all times. He’d cast that every chance he got, and always introduce himself as the mayor of that town, even when the townsfolk were standing right there, actively denying that he had any representative authority over them. 

It was funny how much this would irk our DM, so of course he made sure to summon the sash at least once per game."
Fascinating

"&gt; You can't just kill another PC unless they give you their okay because they want to quit or make another character though.

Yes you can.

You can't if you're playing the ""let's all try to make this session enjoyable for everyone and play around each other"" but if one player of your group acted against your will in a way that severely impacts your character, I don't see the issue in making your PC act accordingly to what he experienced.

&gt; In short they don't want their character to be defined by the other players' actions.

Well that's understandable, it's like writing a story and suddenly someone come and introduces a huge change that forces you to rewrite the ending. But I think that's where the beauty of D&amp;D is, your character should change according to what surrounds it.

Anyway I think the n°1 rule in D&amp;D is good understanding between the players, once you get into that kind of ""an eye for an eye"" scenarios, you're doomed. I would just go for the kill of the other player PC if it feels appropriate and/or offer to leave the campaign after that as I don't see a reason my PC (if hurt by the act) would stick around.

"Get a cobbler to make a custom fit pair of boots or shoes. You won't believe what you're missing. It's like walking barefoot, yet protected. The comfort of a bespoke shoe can not be overstated. I spent $800 on a pair of boots 10 years ago that still look new, I've had the sole replaced one, they still feel amazing as when I first got them. No break in period, they go equally as well with a suit as they do jeans at a cost of $80/year

"&gt;I also suspect it has something to do with dumb patriarchy shit, like overvaluing a woman's ""purity"" and/or virginity.

I think that does play into it a lot. I have a friend who was raped and her boyfriend actually dumped her because she wasn't a virgin anymore - it's that moronic.  


I think another big indicator is if you look at a lot of the female Saints - the vast majority of them were virgins who died rather than give up their virginity. Philomena, Catherine of Alexandria, just to name a couple. It very much gives the idea that a woman's ""virtue"" is more important than her life, at least on a subconscious level."

It took me about 45 minutes until after I left the house to realize that’s what was going on with no options of returning home to change. I keep the litter box clean but this was a moment of rebellion for the little fool and the pee area was small, near the bottom of one pant leg. I was so embarrassed. For someone else who doesn’t keep their cat box as clean they may never notice because they’re desensitized to that awful stench. Not trying to say it is ok, just trying to say they may not be aware at all. "

"Yes, and the worst part is, they're so good at the manipulation, people don't see it as wrong, that YOU are the one in the wrong to reject their help.

Source: Had parents like this for a long time. Moved out when I was 21. Told me if I did it, not to expect anything from them. I laughed and said I'd manage. It wasn't without struggle but I broke free. And then, at 24 , I decided to get married. Then, all of the sudden my mother is mother of the year and wanting to drop thousands of dollars on our wedding, just to look good for the relatives. I told my husband flat out we do not accept money from her. So we paid for it ourselves, but she still acted like her opinions mattered more than mine. I would try to vent and tell people how she's trying to do things behind my back and drop money she doesn't have on this wedding, but people were saying ""Aww, that's so sweet of her"". No. It isn't. Not when she ignores what I say, despite the fact I don't want her money. Not when she'd take out loans to throw an elaborate wedding when she has two under 18 kids as a single parent with an ex husband in prison and didn't pay child support (not why he went), just so she'd look good as mother of the bride. 

Also, I find it disturbing when you have people with these manipulative parents that kick their kid out for something stupid (usually they're over 18 at this point), and then a week later the kid comes back saying ""You know freedom is overrated"", and they stay at home bending to their parents' will. No, freedom isn't overrated, your parents just did a piss-poor job teaching your life skills so you could remain dependent on them.

"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.  Your brain is essentially in a fishbowl suspended in liquid. If it takes a hard enough blow, you experience bruising. This is known as a concussion. This causes a protein to form in your brain called Tau. Normally, the buildup is not cause for concern; no case has ever been observed from a single concussion. Sustained prolonged hits to the head, especially while the brain is already bruised, causes the complications that are CTE.

Muhammad Ali in his later years showed signs of CTE (mainly the Parkinson's side of things). However, it can affect someone's decision making, judgement, emotional, and behavioral traits.

"F1 engineers fight weight more than anything else, including aerodynamics. Millions of dollars a year are spent developing every inch of the car to be as light weight as possible. For example, in a standard F1 transmission the gears are machined to the highest precision, and the gear for reverse is lightened to the extent that they even drill out material from within the teeth of the gear. The reason is that gear sees little use, and it needs to withstand minimal torque, so even the grams of weight that can be saved from removing material from inside the teeth of the gear is useful. 

The point of the weight savings is so the car can be weighted specifically where the engineers want. The minimum weight of a F1 car this year is 733kg including the driver, and most F1 cars only weigh around 550kg before ballast. It's so serious that most taller F1 drivers face a serious handicap because their added mass reduces the amount of available ballast on the car, making their cars handle worse than their competition.

"Everyone in our newsroom does their absolute hardest to report the facts. More specifically, I work in local news, but in a very large market. You’ll find most newsrooms really want to do right by our viewers, and that means providing the most accurate facts we can. (Obviously accidents and updates happen!) However, where I think we’ve failed is in “plug and play” reporting. We are not a Sinclair station, but it’s still very easy to run national stories we have access to without asking any questions. It doesn’t always necessarily come down to dishonesty, but laziness and disenchantment. Be nice to your journalists friends! We are trying, but we’re in the same boat as everyone else in America.

"Not OP, but it's a little bit of both. I fucking loved Adam and Drew when they were on Loveline. Actually, I *still* listen to old episodes relatively consistently. It's hilarious even today.

Modern Adam doesn't have the same... sharpness? He's repetitive, which he was before, but back then he made the repetitiveness funny. He just had a refreshing and brilliant sense of humor, which seems to only flash through on occasion now. I find it a bit difficult to describe.

u/JohnnyRyde wrote this earlier and I tend to agree:

&gt; The dynamic between the two has changed. When Adam joined the Loveline workplace, Drew had already been doing it for several years. Even though they were billed as co-hosts, it was essentially Drew's show that Adam was new to. While Adam was there for a long time, it takes a long while before that initial dynamic changes...
&gt; 
&gt; When the ADS show started, the dynamic was reversed. Adam had been doing podcasts from his studio for years and now Drew was going into Adam's turf. It changed the work relationship between the two.
&gt; 
&gt; I feel Adam works better in the first scenario than the second. In the first, Drew is the teacher and Adam is the class clown that makes going to class a little more fun. In the second, I can't even think of a positive analogy. Adam is the drunk guy ranting at the bar and Drew is the guy with his eye on the clock and taking Adam's keys away from him."

"It depends on where you live in the USA. Deep south might teach you abstinence only, but funny enough, I was raised in a Catholic household that taught us this: ""If you're going to have sex, these are the awful diseases that can happen to you, along with pregnancy, but condoms WILL help prevent them.""

I believe the idea was to scare us into not having sex but they were still like ""here are the alternatives if you just can't fucking help yourselves"". They gave us all the info. ""Here's how sperm works. Here's how the vagina works. Here's why STDs are an issue."" That kind of deal. 

Granted, we were also taught that evolution is real and the earth wasn't flat, which is something that most people don't seem to get. I'm an atheist now but I don't have a single bad memory where I was intentionally misled in Catholic school. Hell, to get to 8th grade we had to have a basic understanding of physics and not just ""God made it so"". 

I imagine it was the diocese though."

"I live in Malaysia. We had a family picnic and didn't think to take precautions against the monkeys, which were absolutely everywhere. There are at least two species of monkey where we live: Macaques and Silvered Leaf Monkeys. The Macaques are more numerous and aggressive, but they usually maintain their distance. You'll rarely be able to get within 2 meters of a Macaque without it running away, although it will behave in a threatening manner before you get that close. So we were surprised when, in the middle of our picnic, this gang of Macaques literally raided the picnic blanket, jumping on us, stealing everything they could grab in 0.5 seconds. Drinks, fruit, bags, bread...everything. But the funniest part was my daughter. She loves bananas. The sight of her standing there with one arm reaching out and screaming in slow motion: ""Baaaa-naaa-naaa!!!!!"" as she sees her prized bananas disappearing into the sunset. Years later, we still tease her by spontaneously calling, ""Baaaa-naaa-naaa!!!!!"" "
"That can make it a past tense verb.

"My sister dated a guy that would argue with you for everything. If you told him the sky was blue he'd make up an argument to tell you it wasn't. One day my dad got these gorgeous ribeye steaks that were on sale for dinner. My sister's favorite meal is steak. Her ""loving"" boyfriend was coming over to eat. He decided that we shouldn't have steak. We should have sandwiches because ""everybody loves sandwiches!"" No regard for what was already planned/defrosted or what the rest of us wanted. I'm still trying to figure out  why my parents went with it. 

This jackass couldn't drive and expected my sister to drop everything and chauffeur him places. If she was in the middle of something or just didn't want to do it, he'd go off on her for hours until she caved. Never once did he offer to pay for gas.

One time, out of NOWHERE, he blindsided her with the sentence, ""If you ever broke up with me I would live a miserable existence until I was 21 then drink myself to death.""

Here's the best part, they started dating in high school so eventually they had to cross the ""going away to college"" bridge. My sister fell in love with a school 3 states away. From the minute we visited she wanted to go. Everybody was a little worried because her depression and anxiety get real bad during ""transition periods."" It was about 20 minutes away from my school though so my parents felt more comfortable. They also considered renting us an apartment 1/2 way between schools. The point is, she actually got in and everybody was on board with it because for the first time in her life my sister was taking charge of her future and being responsible. Everybody, that is, except her jackass boyfriend. The minute she tells him that she's going to apply to this school he tells her he's enlistinging in the army (he was this scrawny, non-athletic, unhealthy asshole that never got off the couch). This sends my sister spiraling into anxiety about his well being. She focused so much on him she missed every deadline for actually registering and ended up staying home. The same day she announced she was going to start by taking some credits at the community college he decided that ""the army isn't for me."" That was 2012. They ended up breaking up a few years ago but the damage is done. My sister has taken about all the general electives she can at community college and then dropped out. She has no idea what she wants to do in school anymore and has no desire to pursue education. I don't think she'll ever go back. 

He destroyed her life because he was abusive and needed her love to validate him. He sucked away what could have been amazing opportunities for her. She is so bright she just struggles with executive dysfunction. And once she had finally started to master that he kicked out the legs from under her and she's been unable to get back up. I will never forgive him for that."

Often forgotten because his career as an athlete was cut short very early, he was and probably is the most impressive American pro athlete ever aside from maybe Michael Jordan or LeBron James. He was all-state in three sports simultaneously and was setting records in all three at the same time in high school in Alabama. He is also the only person to be named as an all star in two major professional sports leagues at the same time, (MLB and NFL) and on top of that he won the Heisman at Auburn in college. Generally understood to be a freak of nature who was both inhumanly fast and strong, story after story points out his incredible athleticism at the highest level of competition."

"I began casually dating a guy who told me he was in an open relationship with a girl who was in a different country. They had apparently decided to become open because she was going to be gone for a year or two. 

After hanging out a few times he started to really like me, so I told him that he needed to inform his girlfriend that he had met someone else. Which, shouldn't have been a big deal since they were open and she even gave him permission to move on.

Well, after he told her I learned some shit about her. She was a 17 year old high school dropout traveling in Thailand for her ""spiritual journey"" or whatever and I started getting these messages like, ""hahahahah don't fuck my boyfriend k."" 

I was 20 going on 21 and beyond that kind of shit. He then started telling me all this nasty shit she was saying about me saying that I ""looked like a 12 year old."" She was *actually* a child. 

The relationship endured for like four months of this girl going back and forth between dumping him and wanting him back as soon as he was with me and he'd always go back. 

All of his friends and family started treating me and talking to me like ""the other girl"" and I'd be informed constantly how much cooler his on-again-off-again ex was. I was only ever with him when they were ""off."" He even compared me to her physically. 

It was one of the most emotionally abusive rides I've ever been though and at the end of it he and his friends called *me* an abusive psychopath for just wanting him to admit what he did. He knew I was naive and that I liked him and that I was vulnerable after coming out of a previous abusive relationship. So, I was used as a cash cow when he was ""off"" with the girlfriend. A whole Facebook status was made about how I'm ""mentally ill"" and abused him. 

I did it because I had no self esteem and I wanted him to care about me. Manipulative people feed on that. "

So people are forced to literally burn up nearly $2k worth of casket! Not very green.

"I think it has less of an effect than just being constantly badgered by your family like people used to be. 

The main difference nowadays is that people can talk about these feelings. We still have stigma about depression and mental illness, but since we're talking about it it's lessening. We still have stigma about homosexuality, but were talking about it, so it's lessening. Transgender is the latest in this line. 

It's not that these things never existed before, it's that people can finally talk about them without just being shamed by their small minded local village. People used to just pretend everything was OK, and that was considered strength and the appropriate way to behave. That is what has changed."

If you don't feel it carries any moral weight, then why are you personally against it?

If you feel it does carry moral weight, then why is it ok for other people to carry out that which you may find immoral?

EDIT: Just to clarify, if you are pro-choice I don't really find much logical inconsistency if you do not consider an embryo/fetus a person.

"Back in high school I had a gf give me an ultimatum - you need to stop talking to you best friend (also a girl) or we can't go out anymore.  

Walking home after being dumped, I realised two things:

1. the best friend probably meant more to me than I had admitted to the now ex-gf
2. Ultimatums are a form of manipulation and control

As a result, I decided I'd never give anyone an ultimatum like that, and if I ever felt it necessary, it was time to walk away and that if anyone that gives me an ultimatum like that is not going to get the outcome they want."

"For me, and I'm sure for a lot of other people, testing is just something that will make me extremely angry, probably to the point that if we were still just dating and not living together I'd leave. I don't want even the first thing to do with any kind of drama whatsoever. But I'm not territorial or manly man either, and if you put me into those situations it would at the very least be time for a serious relationship talk.

If you have to force someone into situations to bring out traits they don't normally display you are going to be extremely disappointed. Find someone with the traits you are looking for in the first place."

It's just not important to men.

How do I balance out these two conflicting ideas of wanting to have some form of relationship, but knowing that it will just kill me along the way?

Do I walk away and never speak or see her again, as it won't be helpful for me in the long run. 

Or do I tough it out?

"I am 52 so not sure if I qualify as 'old' but when I was a kid the world was in just as bad of shape.  The big difference I see is that we received our news from the morning paper or the local/national news in the evenings. Small, easy-to-digest morsels with little details. We read or heard the bad stuff, thought about it for a few seconds, and went back to playing in the back yard or riding bikes.

Kids today are constantly barraged  with the most horrific, soul-sucking, depressing news from around the world. Murders, robberies, wars, famines, political fights, abuse, lying, betrayal. I could go on and on. The worst of the human species is being served up at an all-you can eat news buffet and and kids are gorging on the dishes. The level of mental trauma being experienced by this generation is staggering.

So back to my original point, the world was just as bad when I was a kid. I will choose 1982. I was 16 years old and here is a few of the things happening that year.

* The Cold War was in full force
* Argentina invaded the Falklands Island starting a war with the UK.
* Israel invaded Lebanon
* All time record lows in dozens of cities throughout the Midwestern United States with talk of a possible ice age.
* The terrorist group IRA continued it's bombing campaign in London and Mainland Britain
* Around 700,000 demonstrators gathered in New York City's Central Park protesting the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
* Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide kill 7 in Chicago September 29th
* We were in a severe recession
* The inflation rate was 6.16%
* Unemployment was 10.8%

So yes, things look bad to you. The world is a bad and there will always be problems. Don't let it stop you from living your life, having fun,  and trying to make the world a better place.  Take life a little at a time, not all at once. Do what you can. Be happy.

Then, Halloween night rolls around and he bursts into my room and is in panic mode!  His friends are going out and he doesn't have a costume and he needs one RIGHT NOW!

I ended up giving him my pizza hut polo shirt, my pizza hut hat, nametag, and had him wear black shoes and black pants.  I also happen to have a pizza box in the fridge, so I emptied that and let him carry it around.   

He went around knocking on doors and letting people know that their pizza was there.  When they said ""But I didn't order any pizza!"" he would open the box, which said ""TRICK OR TREAT"" in it.  He used a delivery bag as his candy bag. "

"**Story Time:** back in like seventh grade there was this girl who I thought was gorgeous. Dancer, thin, cute. I was non of these things. Her friend had a huge crush on my friend (he wasn't interested). So anyways, after hanging out at the mall one day, I gathered the nerve to ask her out. She said yes. I was ecstatic. Like a giddy school girl. Anyways fast forward a few months later. We broke up probably 5 times by now. All brake ups initiated by her. Welp each time I begged and graveled for her to take me back (wicked pathetic shit). So it's our 6th go around and I've decided that I'm fed up with this relationship. (if you could call it that) so I called her up, (she was camping with family) and told her straight up that we weren't going to work. It was just too exhausting to deal with the constant breaking up. She then manipulate me into taking her back. Telling me she wanted to die, crying. She hit every sympathetic check mark on the list. So of course when she gets home she tells me to come over so we can talk. First me and two friends rode our bikes there. My buddy got in trouble and we had to head back. Then me and my other friend said fuck it let's just get a ride. (I was so stressed out by this shit I didn't even put my bike away and it got stolen right from my front yard.) We get there and her and two friends lead us to this Beautiful abandoned mansion right on the lake. Me and my friend feared for our lives as they led us through this dark and creepy house. Eventually they led us upstairs so me and here could *talk* in a locked bathroom. ""This is it"" I thought. ""They are going to kill us right here and now."" I looked at my friend for what I thought was the last time. I follow her into the bathroom. We talked for a whole 5 minutes then began making out on the floor of this gross ass bathroom. We both survived they day in this house. Needless to say we got back together only to break up a month later. And I was totally OK with it. I was emotionally and mentally drained at this point. After awhile I started to realise she was only with me to try and get her friend and my friend together. Felt used but relieved at the same time. Anyways now I am a proud papa of two, very happy with my current relationship, and my buddy went off to be a rockstar.

My take is that making decisions to “test” people in the ways listed is manipulative. I don’t care if my GF laughs at another guy’s joke because I’m not the only guy in the world that is funny. But if you are laughing at stuff or flirting in order to get your BF to become angry/jealous/protective then that is incredibly manipulative. Dating itself is a test between 2 people to see if they are compatible so we don’t need to devise plans to try and bring out people’s bad sides. If you want to see that side of him then it will come naturally you shouldn’t try and make him territorial

The best thing ever, though, was when I was on a trip with a group of people and this guy was there. He was bragging all about his new phone, and how much better it was than everyone else’s. He then proceeded to drop the phone, and it slid all the way to the other side of this platform we were standing on – right through one tiny hole and into the water. Unprompted, the 12-year-old kid of another person who was there said “ wow dude, your phone slides into tiny holes and into the lake way better than any of ours!” Most unexpected and hilarious response ever! Almost worth years of his ego… Almost."

"Oof, I have a good one. When I was still in cosmetology school, I had a woman come in for a cut and color. You know when you meet someone and immediately get negative vibes radiating off of them? I got them from her. I colored her hair, rinsed her, and got ready to cut. She moved her head constantly, slouched over, and basically wouldn’t sit still enough for me to cut properly, and I was too nervous to ask her to sit still. She ended up with her hair being extremely lopsided and was furious. I told her that because she didn’t keep her head straight, I messed up. That was the wrong thing to say. She was pissed, and loudly told my instructor that I blamed her entirely for what happened. The instructor finished the haircut for me, and I didn’t even go to school the next day because of how embarrassed I was, which was probably a good thing because I was told her husband came in looking for me."

Not saying hot guys get an infinite pass to be creepy just saying they get a little more leeway than ugly guys, where rose tinted glasses may obscure a girl or her friends from realizing something is crossing their boundaries. I think it's silly to think attractiveness has no influence on a person's perception of someone and their actions when scientific studies clearly show that they objectively do. "

My boyfriend and I are working really hard to get our own place soon though and I'll finally have my own bed to call my own, but until then I'm just here."

"truth be told i secretly pushed things so that when I was ready to move out I could just do it, no permission or arguments as to how I won't like paying bills necessary. 

The last real conversation I had with my dad was over the phone. I was at my therapists place, during an appointment that my dad refused to go to bc I wouldn't tell him what it was about. 

I told him, to his face, that I was tired of dealing with him.

when he asked me why, I told him that everything I could say has already been talked about and he just didn't listen. He and my step mom both act like it's just one long temper tantrum, but it's been a year, and I do what I want.

" Walmart would go bankrupt if they had to follow OSHA rules, the company cannot actually unload and stock that much freight safely. I have worked at a super center for 1 year today, and have came close to many injuries that were never in my control. One of the most common break of rules is in the backroom (of course) where piles of boxes that are not properly secured reside. Even opening one of the Walmart trucks is a hazard, you wouldn’t believe how many times large pallets of heavy boxes just fall right out, it would be death for an inexperienced worker to open a truck. Also a couple months ago, the management created a huge safety hazard by relocating our plastic waste bin, to a new area that had an exposed electrical outlet that was still in use. Another time i was almost squished to death because a manager was fed up with his job and didn’t care that he was knocking over loaded carts with the fork lift.  Its absolutely horrible and i don’t know why they get away with everything they do.

"The 'tragedy of the commons' is not fundamental to life. It was an idea that took root as a justification for early agro-capitalists to seize and enclose common land which had been sustainably farmed for centuries. The commons have to be well managed, of course; they only become 'tragic' if people stop thinking in terms of their social obligations to the community and start thinking about the short - term maximisation of their own gain; in other words, when they stop thinking like associates co-managing a common resource for the common good and start thinking like capitalists.

The family friendliness of her tours makes the “gross older lady hitting on young studs” thing not really happen.

"I once went on two dates with a girl, we hooked up at her insistence (and with little resistance on my part), and then she texted me saying it wasn't going to work out. I was upset, but moved on. She messaged me the next week almost as if nothing had happened, just making conversation about some news article. When I asked about the past texts, she said she was just in a weird mood and didn't mean any of it.

I tried to look past it and go on another date or two, but amidst a lot of weird mixed signals, I had to end things. She just wasn't good at communicating. Not that I'm stellar either, but if you can't manage it as a couple, it just won't work."

"It's a South Park reference. ""Hell on Earth"" is an episode that played on the Sweet 16/18 parties that super rich spoiled girls would have. Instead, it was Satan in the birthday girl role, and he's having a halloween party. 

Satan initially gets dressed up as Brandon Lee's Crow and warns his minions to not duplicate his costume idea, but one of his assistants has a slutty schoolgirl outfit that he gets jealous of so Satan forces a switch and goes to the party as a schoolgirl. It's a pretty good episode, much better than recent seasons. "

"Some background: my favorite quote lies in the middle of a novel, which is an odd place, perilously located on none of the traditional conflict-climax-resolution pyramid points readers learn around age twelve.

At the outset of the novel, the reader meets an enchanting, clever, experienced, self-effacing, poetic, incredibly *interesting* narrator, who admits to a minor personal flaw that he mostly keeps under control. Through the ensuing pages, the reader begins to warm to and identify with the narrator as he strides and stumbles through his nondescript middle-aged life, all the while making clever multi-language puns and surprising his newfound fellow traveler with keen insights into the people they meet together. A particularly charmed reader may come to find some merit to the narrator's assertion that but for his small and common failing, life would be fine and dandy for him and everyone who matters to him. *So what if he drops a few inconsistent details now and again?* thinks the reader. *My memory certainly doesn't speak with absolute confidence, so I shouldn't expect such from his.*

The narrator is subjected to a dreadful scene, the highest drama in the narrator's story so far, punctuated by a full stop of senseless tragedy. After a brutally final denouement, the exhausted-yet-pleased narrator confidently lays two sentences before the reader, like a waiter serving an aperitif of black coffee or fortified liqueur at the end of a fine meal. But instead of aiding digestion, this brew of thirty-five words constricts and curdles the reader's stomach in agony, as they realize (too late) that the narrator they accompanied and admired has never been anything but a poisonous beast wearing a man's skin.

I have no interest in making someone cum, sometimes accidents happen, but it's very violating for me to agree to dance for someone and for them to cum, when that was not what we agreed on nor was it my intention. Can you see how if I'm offering lapdances, intend to only dance, and to make a man cum how that could feel violating to me? I never agreed to get someone off. "

Third time I said ok fine.  I took her out, went to dinner, walked her around town, and went back to my place, nothing more.  We had drinks, laughs.  The gf freaked out, and said ""I can't believe you took her out"".

"Don't fucking do it! If there's one thing I've learned through my relationships (I'm into my lower 30s now), it's that knowingly putting up with a toxic relationship is one of the worst things you can do to yourself. You'll feel good while it's working, and they'll humor you because they know you're being kind to them... but just when you think things are starting to work out and they're maybe getting genuine feelings instead of just pretending to love you, they'll drop you just like you knew they would and you'll feel even worse about yourself. Alternately, you'll both care about each other but some sort of PTSD has created an abusive knee jerk reaction that causes them or you to feel some acute insecurity and then lash out at you or manipulate you with guilt subconsciously until you get into an endless loop of bad blood with someone you care about. I don't know, I guess I'm not an expert, but there's a reason I'm not dating anyone now after 7 straight years of giving my all to other people in spite of perhaps ""knowing better"". In the very least, I've resolved to be a hell of a lot pickier in who I spend my time and energy on, as the aftermath of my poor relationship choices left me with a lot to deal with mentally and emotionally. And believe me, I'm no perfect person, but to my credit I always gave 110%, even if only by principle (which is another trap you should try to avoid, because I think it's a tad dishonest even if your intentions are good). I'd like to think I'm willing to do that again... but only if it's reciprocated and backed by logic and not bursts of emotion. So now I involve myself in other social activities and spend my personal time creating things. Eventually I'll love myself and maybe I can meet someone who was willing to spend the time and effort to develop themselves as well, or if not, I can still be proud of the effort I put in for my own sake. Good luck and though it's difficult... you can be happy."

I didn't make fun of him, but I also let everything he said go in one ear and out the other. So... pretty uneventful on my end. Restocking, cleaning and reorganizing the store kept me moving because he often smelled. He would finish ranting or talking trash then leave. He wasn't all that much worse than some of the know-it-all nerds who would simply stand around talking shit about games or try to troll the customers. He seemed like a harmless kid with a mental disability."

"No, their logic checks out. If a man has a larger penis then they are viewed as more desirable by potential mates, leading to larger sizes as time goes on. With the invention of clothing it lessens the importance of size by a fair margin. It is more difficult to judge a potential mate by their size because you likely won't see it before having intercourse with them, so it's easier for less endowed individuals to mate."

"Sourcing from [this what-if xkcd article](https://what-if.xkcd.com/44/)

It gets even cooler when you look at the neuroscience and timing required for throwing things; the difference between throwing a strike or a ball is about half a millisecond in either direction.

It takes about 5 milliseconds for the fastest nerve impulse to travel the length of the arm. That means that when your arm is still rotating to the correct position, the signal to release the ball has already reached your wrist.

In terms of how insane this timing is, it's like a drummer dropping a drumstick from the 10th story and hitting a drum on the ground on the correct beat."

"Why exposing politicians as hypocrites doesn't work to affect their careers and what people should do instead if they want to replace someone in office.

I am pretty sure that the reason it doesn't work is that most people think of politicians as people who are, by nature, somewhat...let's say ""uneven"" in their opinions and in how their lived lives match with their espoused ideals. In other words, the bar is already low for pretty much anyone in elected office. So merely showing someone to be a hypocrite just confirms most people's unconscious bias against politicians. It also means that it is really low hanging fruit, which I think is what makes it so tempting for the opposition to go for. Probably every person in elected office has some huge inconsistency in their history. 

This why no one cares that Trump tweeted for years about what a lazy president Obama was when he was golfing, but Trump himself takes way more time off now that he's president.

"Canterbury Tales is really fascinating to me when compared to, say, *anything* written in Old English. Canterbury Tales is different enough to be hard but similar enough to Modern English to be at least somewhat intelligible. It seems to me that the language changed a lot more between the Norman Invasion in 1066 and Geoffrey Chaucer's lifetime (d. 1400, less than 300 years) than it did between, say, Chaucer and now! (more than 500 years). Arguably, English underwent two separate Creolization events, one from the vikings and one from the Normans (or French vikings).

Look at the *Codex Exoniensis*, the Exeter Book (composed in the 10th century CE). It has some lovely dirty riddles in it, composed in Old English. [For example](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Riddles_of_the_Exeter_Book/74):

*Ic eom wunderlicu wiht     wifum on hyhte*

*neahbuendū nyt     nængum sceþþe*

Edit: Translation:

I am a wonderful thing, a joy to women,

to my neighbors useful. I injure no one

who lives in a village; save only my slayer.

I stand up high; and steep over the bed;

underneath I'm shaggy. Sometimes ventures

a young and handsome peasant's daughter

a maiden proud, to lay hold on me.

She seizes me, red, plunders my head,

fixes on me fast, feels straightaway

what meeting me means; when she thus approaches,

a curly-haired woman. Wet is that eye.

"I had a player that was, at the best of times, hammered during our sessions (he was on so many shrooms our first session that other people had to make his character for him), regularly made rape jokes and other weird comments. He would have been *that guy* if not for the facts that A) everyone else already knew and liked him, so I gave him a chance and found that I too really liked him, and B) he's a professional chef who cooked something interesting for us every session and saved us from the cliché of ordering cheap, crappy pizza every week.

So, he rolls up a Dwarven monk whose unarmed strikes are cockslaps, and, for the sake of my own sanity, I just don't treat any of his rape jokes as in-character. Until the day the party passes through a small town where shit keeps going wrong, and a beautiful human woman is looking for her sister who ran away, said she was in the town, but is nowhere to be found.

Of course, this guy says his character wants to rape her.

I stepped outside and laughed for a good 5 minutes at the mental image of his character unwittingly wandering into the reach of a Green Hag's claws and getting his precious dick slashed off before he even knew he needed to defend himself. Eventually, I decided that revealing her disguise and disfiguring his character wouldn't resolve the problems I had with him, and I returned to the table and continued my policy of ignoring the lewd comments and rape jokes of this player, but I still wonder ""What if...?"""

"Well, we really liked to set stuff ablaze when we were young

And we once found a tree with lots and lots of resin coming out, so it was an ideal target to light up.

So we hit the fire with sticks for some time to no avail. That thing burned like satans dick, and we thought we were fucked. But then we saw a plate of hard plastic / elastic (I dont really know how its called in english, its like something you put over a shed and is very flexible plastic) just laying around. We wrapped that around the tree and held it there until the flames went out.

The forest was full of smoke, and we just laughed about it and moved on.

We could have burned down dozens of square miles of the woods, hadnt it been for some guy just throwing his construction trash next to the tree. Didnt hit me until I told the story to a barkeeper years later how fucking dumb that was"

My parents weren't manipulative but more-so coddled me and were helicopter parents.

In high school, i was passionate with sports, and long story short things got fucked up and I lost a ton of scholarship money (part of it was due to how they raised me).

I fell into a giant depression, ended up staying at home for 3 years barely scraping by In school, nearly attempted suicide, until I was 22 (just recently) and said I have enough. My friend has a house near Michigan and he booked a sales job for me, so I hitched a train here and I might stay.

It was horrific, for a while to hear them say ""you have it easy at home! If you leave, you will get depressed. You can't possibly work and go to school on your own"". I had no life. I couldn't bring girls over. I had a curfew. I was like a teenager. They used to convince me to stay home.

Now I'm working 40-60 hours a week, gym. Food shopping, doing hard jobs and it's insanely EASIER because i have my own sex life, own independence, own happiness, own money. They made it clear that I would have to depend on mommy and daddy, but they were fucking wrong and I knew it. Keep in mind, I was struggling to take 2-3 classes and work part time when I was at home. It was just too depressing and overbearing.

I just wish i would have done it sooner. I love them and they mean well, but they need to teach their kids how to fend for their own and be independent.

You *can* communicate what feels good, but after enough time both parties should have a general idea of what feels good and what doesn't. After that, it's all about taking your time and just enjoying the moment. Lots of kissing, slow rubbing, and embracing. It's not about rushing to the end, but basking in the journey and the sensations.

"In our CAD-based course we had an assignment where you had to build a model out of Lego, make the Lego bricks in the CAD software and use them to assemble the same model in CAD, superimpose the model into an image, do a cross-section of it etc.

Most students spent ages measuring Lego blocks and making little CAD models of them for assembly. Some students spent ages measuring them with verniers. Some made up their own dimensions so the width of one brick was 1, etc. Some made some of the bricks solid to save time if they were not going to be part of the cross-section view.

One girl realised that she didn't have to do any of this because the folders in which our CAD data was stored were not protected in any way, so she just stole random blocks from different people to make her model. It was not immediately apparent, but the cross-section view was a joke as some of the blocks were solid, they were all slightly different sizes, etc.

It was immediately apparent that she had simply stolen her components from a number of different sources but luckily she had enormous boobs and was able to easily pass."

"I have to partially disagree here. When you go the more expensive route with dentistry, more often than not, what you're paying for is a cosmetic improvement over the cheaper option. Crowns and fillings that match your tooth color, etc. If that's important to you, then by all means pay the extra cost.

But for someone like me - middle aged, married with kids, and a mortgage to pay - it's rarely worth it to do anything other than the cheap option. Silver fillings (although the color matched fillings are *almost* as cheap as silver now), gold crowns, etc. The gold crowns, in particular work perfectly fine and I've never had any issues with them.

I've had the expensive CEREC crowns, and honestly I had way more issues with those than I've ever had with gold crowns. Chipping, cracking, coming loose, etc. Even though all the dentist's fancy marketing material claims that the CEREC crowns are not only better looking but also more durable, I've found the complete opposite to be true regarding durability.

One thing to keep in mind with those expensive crowns is that it's in your dentist's interest to push you toward the CEREC crowns. Not just because they charge more for them either, but also because they can 3D print them on the spot and not have to sub it out to a shop that makes crowns. This also means fewer visits per dollar spent, which helps them see more patients and make more money. 

I had a dentist who would always try to push me to the CEREC crowns, but I'd always say no and insist on a regular gold crown. He'd say okay and then just give me a CEREC crown anyway, but at the price of a gold crown. This was because even at the lower price, it was still more convenient and profitable to him to just go print one up on his CEREC machine than to contract it out to a shop. That should tell you something about what the markup is on those crowns. My guess is that they charge exorbitantly for them because they're trying to break even on their investment in the CEREC machine as fast as they can.

At first I thought I was getting a great deal. Getting the ""better"" crown at the cheaper price. But like I said, I've had nothing but trouble with those crowns. I ended up having a couple of them replaced with gold crowns and haven't had any trouble since. It's also worth noting that the oldest crown I have is a gold crown, and it has lasted 28 years with no issue except for having to be cemented back on once or twice."

"I second asking for current license.

My husband has done electrical work but under someone with a license for years. He got a new job at a big name company who franchises and has Mr in their name. It was a husband and wife that ran the company out of their house. My husband told them his experience (which was minimal) and they talked about how he's gonna move up from a grunt basically and how he'll be making good money.

They put him in a truck by himself within the first month. He had only run wires in new builds and they had him going to peoples houses and diagnosing and fixing problems. He kept tellimg them he wasn't ready. He'd call on every job for help because he didn't know and they'd get mad at him for it and mad that he was taking longer to do the jobs. He had no training or licence or anything. He was so scared of doing something wrong and causing property/personal damage that he quit. (There were other things they did like screwing with his pay and trying out the company finances on him but the risk really scared him).

"I'm not OP, but the past few decades have been really awful for working people and people of color. The war on drugs, mass incarceration, the militarization of police, dramatic increases in immigration enforcement, the invention of ICE. 

For working people more generally, the federal government began slashing the social safety net in the 1970s, leading to dramatic increases in homelessness, economic insecurity, and poverty. This coincided with serious under-enforcement of basic labor laws, along with free trade policies that forced U.S. workers to compete against low-wage labor abroad. The upshot has been that millions of Americans have far less of a say over their working lives than they did "

"Fun 747 fact time!

So as you know the early 747 models only had a very short hump, the current ""classic"" proportions really only came around with the -300 and -400 models

In adding that 2nd deck stretch for the -300, they actually *lowered* the cruise drag on the plane by inadvertently area-ruling it - the hump starts to shrink right about where the wing starts, and the overall cross-sectional area stayed much more constant, reducing wave drag and lowering overall cruise drag despite higher skin friction

"Not a son or daughter but the relationship of a very close friend who was pregnant at the start of the relationship. She dated this guy who started out all sweet and wonderful for about 6 months, and then went downhill from there. He started being manipulative relatively small at first, if she went out while he was at work he'd make her feel guilty because ""I would have liked to go there, why couldn't you wait for me to come home/to have a day off?"" Then he upped it from there to getting pissed at her if she went out without him. They'd argue a lot because he always had to be right about everything and wanted to do what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it. If she didn't help clean at the exact moment he wanted to, huge fight; even if she suggested he just do half now and she'd start on her half in an hour or two, it wasn't like she was just being lazy (although being 8 months pregnant she'd have a good reason to be). If he was going out for food and she told him ""I'm not hungry/in the mood for w.e., don't get me anything,"" he'd bring home food for her anyway, and then start a huge argument if she didn't eat it. Several times he threw things at her while she was pregnant.

After she had the baby he'd call her 10 times a day while he was at work and have a fit if she didn't answer immediately, meanwhile she's trying to juggle a new baby, doing laundry, making herself something to eat, and cleaning the apartment all at the same time. So she just drop everything the moment he wants something from her. He mentioned several times that he was jealous of the baby for getting all of her attention.

Finally one night they had a huge argument because the baby had been crying all day, and when he came home from work she wanted a bit of a break to take a nap. It wasn't late, only 5 pm and he had the next two days off so she had a bit of time before he'd be going to bed to get in a nice nap. He wakes her up not even an hour later saying the baby wouldn't stop crying and he doesn't wanna deal with it. She was pissed that he pretty much refused to help with the baby (this wasn't the first time this had happened), and they got into a huge fight. He told her she should just kill herself so she picked up a knife and said ""maybe I should"" not really meaning it. She wasn't holding it to her wrist or anything remotely close, just holding it. He physically restrained her, forced the knife from her hands, and threw it across the room; which if he'd stopped there would have been absolutely acceptable. He then proceeded to slam her face against the kitchen counter, and essentially beat the shit out of her until she was covered in bruises from head to toe. Then he called the police and said she was still trying to kill herself, he continued to forcibly restrain her and hit her until the cops arrived at which point he said all the bruises were from him trying to restrain her because she'd kept going after the knife, she insists she was absolutely not trying to get to the knife at all, except maybe towards the end thinking he was going to seriously hurt her and fearing for her safety as a weapon to defend herself with. The cops end up taking her to the psych ward because its mandatory.

After they take her out of there the other cop asks ""Who's gonna watch the baby?"" He says he can only watch her over the weekend but then he has work, this is a child he legally adopted mind you, so he's supposed to love her as his daughter, and work was apparently more important. Work is of course important, but when it comes to ""go to work"" or ""baby gets sent to foster care"" I'd pick my kid every time. Besides that he was friends with his boss and definitely would have been given the time off if he said their was an emergency, the mother was in the hospital, and he was the only one there to watch the baby. On top of that he then didn't call the baby's grandmother (my friend's mom) to even inform her about the situation, who would have happily watched the baby for him while he was at work; or even taken the baby for the whole work week if that would have been easier; he had her number saved into his phone and two days to think about this so its not like he couldn't reach her or he only had a minute to think and blanked. No instead he let the child get sent to foster care. My friend was only in the hospital for a little less than a week and came out to find her daughter had been taken away. It took her over a year to finally get her daughter back. To this day she believes he did it because he was jealous of the baby (which he'd stated himself several times in the past) and wanted her all to himself again. Obviously they broke up, but he'd sincerely thought they wouldn't after all this. He then tried to play the victim to everyone, but accidentally told everyone a different story. The night of he told one of his friends (along with the cops) that she'd tried to to get to the knife after he threw it, he told another person she'd gone to grab another knife from the drawer but he'd stopped her, he told me that she'd successfully escaped him several times to grab more knives, he told another friend that she'd grabbed another knife and tried to stab him; his story changed every week and when we all (mutual friends) got together and talked about it became very clear he was lying about the whole thing.

TLDR; So he used a ""suicide attempt"" as an excuse to beat the shit out of her and then called the cops to cover his own ass. He then refused to watch his own kid, despite being able to get time off of work, or call anyone who could and would have watched her so she got taken away to foster care. He did all of this because he was jealous of the baby because she got more attention from his girlfriend than he did."

&amp;#x200B;

Reading through this thread I feel sorry for young women these days.

&amp;#x200B;

Men and women all need to either stop watching porn or people need to start making better porn.  "

"Let me tell you about Gerald the Gay Blacksmith.

I was DM, and I had 5 friends, 2 female 3 male. One of the female friends was playing a male character, a very tall, very muscular dragonborn. At some point towards the end of the session they walked into a blacksmith's shop, met Gerald the Blacksmith and started looking at stuff to buy. Everyone took turns ordering and asking about prices and people bought a few things. Then it came to the dragonborn.

They asked how much a sword was, and in my head since I was talking to the irl friend, I forgot her character was a man, so my brain wanted to say ""for a pretty girl like you i'll give you a discount"", but I remembered that her character was a man halfway through, so I ended up saying ""for a pretty man like you i'll give you a discount"". Cue laughter from everyone at the table and the establishment that Gerald was gay and has a thing for tall, muscular dragonborn men. Not exactly awkward but hilarious nonetheless."

"A good friend of mine is currently in a secure hospital after committing a *seriously* nasty murder. Honestly, I would never have expected anything of the sort from the guy - we spent a lot of time jamming (he played bass in a black metal project of mine, so maybe I should have seen the murders coming?), he was a lovely, chilled out fella.

Anyway, he moved away to a tiny town in Wales, and started smoking spice. It seems that this was self-medicating for mental issues he hadn't told anyone about, and when he moved home and couldn't get hold of any more spice, the voices in his head that he had kept hidden from everyone came back. I have a few text messages saved from him that show his deterioration; a few friends and I were trying to keep an eye on him but we didn't know it was as bad as it was.

The things that he did were *horrifying*. But it wasn't really *him*, if you see what I mean - he's very sick, severely mentally ill, and needs help. While I was shocked by the severity of the crimes, I've forgiven him, and have been to see him a few times. I don't think he's getting out. "
"Of course you can experience nostalgia. It’s nuts that anyone would deny your experience.

"This is one of the few I CAN answer with authority! So I actually am an adult who works with middle school and early high school. And there are some hard facts that back up that comprehensive sex and drug education leads to less sexual partners, higher age of first sexual experience, less spread of sti, less unwanted pregnancy, higher use of contraceptives. Less drug use, safer drug experimentation Basically talking to your kids about drugs and sex  and giving ACCURATE non judgmental Information does the opposite of what helicopter parents are worried about. When teens are informed they are more likely to make logical informed decisions. The goal isn’t to ban teens from sex and make it a forbidden fruit- it’s to educate so they are fully aware of the CONSEQUENCES of sex. 

If you’re interested in this check out: https://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education

"I think your comment is an overreaction to a genuine question. My gf had never cum from PIV before as no guy she had been with had tried to focus on actually making her feel good. There's no telling the age or experience of a person based on a Comment from reddit. I'm not saying what the person suggested is a sure fire way to make a girl cum, I think I've only made my gf cum 2 or 3 times with PIV + stimulation. If it wasn't something she'd tried due to lack of guys experience she's been with and maybe lack of her own sexual experience then it could have been an idea of something to try.

I think your reaction speaks volumes to the type of person you are."

"Death? No, you're right about starving *to death*. Someone intervenes long before then.

But, I am a good example of it. I never had breakfast growing up and the only meal I had was at school. Sometimes, I would have dinner with another student but, my family never had money for food. We did for other things but, not food. (Turns out, my parents just went out to eat without us, a lot). I was hungry from the day I was born until I turned 16 and got a job.

And, worse of all, I am far from the only one. Children go to sleep hungry all over around here. Probably 1 out of 6 kids in the US do not get their recommended daily caloric diet. Now, is this as bad as starving to death 20,000 years ago? Of course not but, they're still hungry. They're still suffering from the lack of a most basic need and, by definition, they are starving. Not to death, they get enough food to actually live. But, not enough to grow to their potential.

though, I will end with ""It is definitely better in the US than in many places"". But, I will also end with ""There is no reason anyone should go without food in the US. There is more than enough thrown away to feed those in need"""

Religion, at its basest core, is about teaching morality. Giving people some kind of line, something they can cling to. Beyond that, I feel that religion is a pillar of support to a lot of people. When someone's life goes south and they nothing seems to go right, it can be incredibly comforting that to them it will all be worth it. That at the end of their struggle they'll be rewarded with a paradise free of their earthly concerns. 

Religion isn't faultless, but it isn't a wholly negative or evil thing. "

"The reason those reflexes are ones that have been to minimise intoxication or infection in the first place. Your body may not know it’s food poisoning per se but it knows when there are high risk factors. Examples are the fact colours such as blue &amp; pink cause people’s appetites to be minimised. These colours &amp; other bright colours in nature usually warn of toxins.
Foul or rancid smells can cause people to heave. That is the body ejecting possible contaminants. Food textures can also make people feel off-put by food. None are sure preventatives but they are all survival instincts.

It's where they talk to someone else about all of their complaints and issues in their relationship instead of talking to their partner. If your partner doesn't know that there are any problems then how can they be fixed.
"Enchanted is the prime example of this. Girl I was interested in made me watch it with her, and Idina Menzel did nothing, *nothing* to deserve being cheated on.

"We have a management meeting every morning. Literally all we do is tell everyone what we're working on that day. Anything more important, if there is anything, is handled after the meeting just with the people it affects and/or need to give input.

About half of the time spent in the meetings is taken up by the maintenance manager, who describes every project in way more detail than anyone needs. He can turn something as simple as, ""We're going to replace the impeller on that pump,"" into a 10 minute monologue. It would be impressive if it weren't so annoying.

Also, the maintenance lead is there. He has to say what he has going on that day, too, which is mostly the same stuff as what the maintenance manager has."

I had a pt who did not have a  garlic clove to treat her yeast infection. She DID have a jar of minced garlic.

She could barely walk in the clinic and the image of her vagina is burned into my brain. "

"Omg yes. I was seeing this guy the last two weeks since I moved up for uni. We would make out and stuff and we're part of the same friend group. We had had the talk about him only wanting to be friends but the making out and stuff continued all initiated by him. I never initiated any of it. I even stayed over at his place in bed with him and we were right on top of each other all night. I just went with the flow, never pushed anything or talked about it.

Now, this week he barely even acknowledges me. Like I feel like he actively makes sure he's on the other side of the room with our other friends between us and when we talk he never says more than one or two words in response and it's always me initiating it."

"Honestly I'm no expert. I've had a lot of manipulative attention seekers in my life and it has been a long journey to break the cycles in myself and how I interact with others to avoid gravitating toward and enabling those traits in others.

So I kind of have a knee jerk reaction to a degree. I'm still clawing my way out of my last relationships with these cycles.

So with that in mind, what I personally do when a friend is going through rough times is bring it up once at the start and leave the issue in their hands after that. If they want to discuss it then, they can. If they want to discuss is later, they can. Otherwise I just try to stay in touch with phone calls to catch up on basic shit and I don't bring up whatever the main stressor in their lives unless they do.

Really what they might need if anything is the recreational activity of just talking about normal stuff or having something to laugh at for a brief while. All their other time is devoted to worrying about their stressor.

When I'm going through a rough situation I'm often trying to keep a handle on myself and maintain perspective as the situation progresses. Since the situation is often larger than my immediate view while I'm feeling stressed, I don't like to necessarily define the situation just for the sake of explaining it to someone else. The worry being that I might define it incorrectly in my haste and begin a loop of reinforcing the incorrect definition before I was ever done observing and interpreting the issue.

On the other hand, often time blabbing things out unfiltered with a trusted friend can reveal a lot to us they we may not have seen in our own minds. I think it has a lot to do with where the person is with their issue and how much energy/ability they have to confront it fully."

"You're underestimating the out of class time by quite a bit, especially when it comes to grading papers. A typical 10-12 page paper will take on average about 75 minutes to read and write feedback for. For a small class of just 20 students (the type I teach), a single paper can produce 25 hours worth of work. In a writing-intensive class you might have 2-3 such assignments, as well as some smaller things that take much less time to grade. Grading alone for a single class can easily take around 100 total hours.

Class prep is going to be somewhere around an hour per class. Some classes take very little prep, but if we're doing a reading, the reading alone (not to mention finding appropriate readings and doing lesson planning on top of it) could take more than an hour. Assume about 30 hours of class prep (1 hour per day of class for a class meeting twice a week for 15 weeks).

Add in office hours of 2 per week for 30 more hours, but discount it by half since some other work is being done then.

That gets us to 45 hours of class time, 30 hours of prep, 100 hours of grading, and 15 hours of office hours. That's 190 hours, more than double your 90 hour estimate. Even if I'm overestimating some of these things, I think the low end for me might be something like 150 hours. And, $4,000 per course is near the high end of the pay scale.

An adjunct working 150 hours and earning $3,000 isn't making $44.44/hr, they're making $20.

And it's not simply a matter of teaching more classes. Universities tend to cap the number of courses adjuncts can teach to avoid having to give them benefits as full-time employees. There's not always other universities to teach at unless you live in a large city with many schools (like NYC or DC). You can add community college courses, but the workload will stay the same while your pay drops to about $2,000 or less.

Finally, teaching 6 courses per semester is insane. The normal full-time load for a non-research faculty member is 3 per semester. If I'm teaching 6 courses that each have 2 substantial writing assignments, I'm going to have to stagger due dates (but can't by much more than a week, otherwise it screws with the course design). Let's say I spread out due dates over 3 weeks, with 2 courses turning in work each week. That's about 50 hours of grading on top of the 18 hours I'd be in class, as well as class prep and office hours. I'd be putting in 65-70 hour weeks when essays are due, which is now 6 out of the 15 weeks. Yeah, no."

"I think that’s a pretty strange stereotype. (I’m neither gay nor a dude, though, so maybe I have no clue what I’m talking about.) Like, it seems very manly that there are men who love manliness so much that they can only be attracted to other men. What’s manlier than another man? Idk, stereotypes are stupid. It’s also weird when you think about them too much. If gay men are supposedly super 100% effeminate, then who is their partner going to be, another super womanly man? Is a gay relationship between two men basically like… a relationship between two women? What? Are gay men so womanly they’re basically lesbians? But wait… lesbians are stereotypically manly/butch. Does that mean lesbians are so manly their relationship would be like gay men’s relationships? What?"
"I had a very similar experience. In highschool I talked to this girl for a while and was pretty much ready to go into full relationship mode with her, but she'd just gotten out of a lengthy, abusive relationship. She said she needed some time to sort herself out which I understood and respected. After about two weeks however she suddenly went ghost on me. (not responding to texts, avoiding me, etc.) I'm a very straightforward person and told her point-blank, ""if you're not feeling this anymore just tell me,"" to which she replied, ""I'm not feeling it anymore."" Fine. We hadn't been talking very long so I got over it. She then started dating my neighbor about 10 days later, so I figured she must've just realized she liked him and didn't know how to tell me. However, she dumped him as well about two weeks later. See a patern? 

Anyway, we stayed friends throughout the rest of highschool and beyond. One day, maybe two years later, she mentioned our short fling while we were reminiscing and asked, ""why didn't we date back then?"" I told her it was because she didn't want to. she says, ""Yes I did! I totally did. I just wanted to see if you liked me and you didn't fight for me."" 

What kinda bullshit is that? How was I supposed to know after two weeks she was testing me, and who would pass a test like that so early in a relationship? I told her all this and also added in the fact that she was dating my neighbor less than two weeks later. Her defense? ""I just dated him to get over you. I liked you so much it scared me and I had pretty bad issues with commitment back then.(Ya don't say...)"" It's like she was trying to live out some bad 80's rom-com and she apparently had no problem toying with everyone else's lives to get that. I'm so glad I was too dense to see through her games back then. It probably saved me a lot of heartache."

"We had to rush my son (2yo) into hospital as we suspected menegitus. The doctor agreed and we have to get him on the right drugs quick, so he injected him with an incredibly big needle.

We then proceeded to the children's ward when he wouldn't let go of me (he's always and still is very very close to me).

They called us in to get a needle in his vein (one that stays in and they connect other things to). They spent about 10 minutes poking holes in him because they couldn't find a vein. The whole time he was just balling his eyes out and staring at me crying, ""daddy help me"". I was a wreck, absolutly destroyed me. They didn't find a vein and we had to go through it all again, took just as long.

That's my worst experience, seeing my son in pain and crying for me to help while I hold him down so people can stab him.

I know parents have been through a ton worse than this with their kids... Anyone who can handle worse is an absolute hero in my eyes, and I saw a lot of worse off kids and parents in the hospital that weekend.

We stayed there overnight, he wouldn't let go of me, but turned out the next day it wasn't even menegitus, just a standard virus."

"Trebuchets were *mostly* used to throw things over castle walls, rather than to tear them down. So, they just had to be large enough. Extreme size would have made them difficult to transport. The *Loup de Guerre* really was designed to level castle walls, and the fully extended arm likely was 30 meters high at least (the exact height is unknown; six stories is the fully extended height of the reconstruction at Caerlaverock Castle, which is often treated as a functional scale model). The counterweight, if proportional to other trebuchets, would have been at least 100 times heavier than the 300 pound projectile. Even lowballing it, a 2,000 pound counterweight would have been small in comparison. It was the exception to the rule, though, and proved the general rule because of how difficult it was to transport and assemble.

It's worth noting that the guy who fielded it, Edward I, refused to let Stirling Castle surrender, which they wanted to do. Seeing the weapon under construction was enough to make them give up, which makes the most extreme estimates of its height (over 100 meters fully extended, which would dwarf the castle it targeted) seem more plausible. If accurate, that would make it one of the largest single weapons of war ever built prior to the 20th century. Edward I just really wanted to put his sophisticated and expensive war machine to use to prove his prowess in combat, which was the biggest part of chivalric concepts of honor. It knocked the wall flat down."

"This is a huge issue within the stripclub industry, because every girl offers something different and every girl has different hard limits. I know girls who give extras like blowjobs with condoms but will absolutely not let men touch their vaginas, or girls who will let you finger them but wont touch you, or girls who will let you get rough but wont do anything else, or girls like me who won't let any touching of genitals happen. It makes it hard for even the girls with higher mileage, because their boundaries are constantly being pushed and violated. 

This is why I believe that if you go to a stripclub, assume every girl is only going to give you a dance, just because that is what has been blatantly agreed on, and then negotiate what can happen beyond that while respecting everyone's boundaries. This is healthy and appropriate, safe, and you will get better service. "

When you're comfortable with those move on to the F chord. It's a bar chord, meaning your index finger will be holding down multiple or all the strings at once while your other three fingers are in formation. It's tough to pick up at first but bar chords change the game."

So I take her home and she just goes to sleep so I go play WoW or something for an all together disappointing evening.

I honestly don’t need to be wined and dined and doted upon to feel loved and all that crap. Sometimes I just wanna get down and dirty. I also believe that men probably like to be told they’re loved and feel special too. But who knows, I’m a woman and clearly a different species. "

"What precisely is the justice system's goal? When we send someone to prison, and put a black mark on their record that makes it hard to get a job when they get out, what exactly of is the purpose of doing so?

Is it to protect society from criminals by locking them up? That argument has some merit, but really only for violent criminals. For addicts, dealers, petty thieves, and other non-violent criminals, the cost of incarceration is orders of magnitude greater than any fiscal damage they could possibly do to society. 

Is the goal discouragement? To disincentivize criminals from committing crime again? If so, it doesn't work very well - the best way to turn someone who made a single mistake into a career criminal is to incarcerate them; you put them in an environment devoid of positive role models, then limit their ability to find meaningful employment once they get out. If you're trying to prevent repeat offense, sending someone to jail is pretty much the worst possible thing you can do. 

What about punishment? These people did something wrong, they deserve to suffer the consequences, right? Except that most criminals aren't evil conniving masterminds who had plenty of opportunities they ignored, these are mostly people who grew up with very little, surrounded by people who told them that crime is okay as long as you don't get caught. They're products of their environment, and punishing people for having a rough upbringing doesn't solve anything. That's not even going into the mental illness side of things either. 

If we actually want to limit crime, to reduce the amount harm done by people breaking the law, we need to rethink how we deal with criminals. We need a system that provides opportunities for growth and change, not one that limits them. It might be expensive at first, but in the long run it would save billions by preventing repeat offenders and breaking the cycle of poverty and broken upbringings. "

"Started playing 1.5 years ago. One friend joined and took it serious at first. Then he got bored and decided since he was the only one who didn’t enjoy it anymore he would make it his mission to ruin the game for everyone else playing.

Think the DnD episode of Community where Pierce shits all over Fat Neil.

How did he do this? He made his character *obsessed* with rape and slavery. Like he started out trying to rape party members any time there was actual role playing going on. Then he tried to enslave every NPC they saved. People started complaining and threatening to quit, so being the DM I made it a point to put a stop to it.

At first to stop the rape I either made it catastrophically fail no matter what he did. Tries to rape the Gnome shop keep? He does it in front of a window and the guards catch wind.

Then when he couldn’t rape he started trying to take slaves specifically sex slaves. My solution was to kill his character at that point. The next time they stopped by his slave plantation he was tracked and surrounded by the local lords forces and died in Red Dead Redemption style standoff with like 20 guards.

He quit playing for like a month then joined back and he made a new character. his first action was to try and rape one of the Players mid fight  so I did the only reasonable thing. Had a goblin single him out, corner him, then incapacitate him, cut his dick off and fuck the wound. 

He said “this is gay” and quit playing for good."

I had given no indication that I wanted my character to pursue a romantic relationship since role-playing that is not something I find appealing, less so with my dad. I had the only single character in the game when I left. I role played my character as a loner. And my dad marries him off to someone who would have caused immense problems for the party if the relationship turned sour. Rather than do that, I stopped playing the character after that session"

I feel that societies are often structured around the idea that children are an extension of their parent's autonomy  not too different from how female spouses used to be such of their male spouse; parents are also typically held responsible for the crimes their children commit who aren't regarded to have their own culpability yet.

People often come with a lot of ""personal freedom"" arguments with regards to how parents should be free to raise their children (and mutilate them) ignoring that children have their own rights as well. People really seem to treat children a lot as falling under their parent's personal autonomy hence  often these kinds of things are considered okay as long as the _parent_ approves and not the child per se but still wrong when the parent doesn't."

"Basically, if you have an older relative but you can't afford their medical care in an old person's home (trust me, you can't) there is Medicare and Medicaid that kind of covers their expenses, to a point.  You cannot transfer their house or assets to yourself for under marker value, meaning that in the five year period where you realize that you have to get rid of their assets before applying for government aid, you can't do it.

I get it from the government's view, but it pretty much means that you, the child of said parent is about to get majorly screwed out of any assets, like said house and savings to let parent into the nursing home.

It truly sucks for everyone because the nursing home deserves their fees, but the parent deserves their lifelong care, but the children get screwed out of an inheritance.  Nobody is a winner here.

Pretty much, if you transfer assets below market value, aka selling your house for a dollar, the government gets seriously pissed off and forces you to pay market value which might be seriously over-valued."

"Hi, climber here.. no, you don't replace a rope after a fall. I fall probably 10-20~ times per day of climbing. The ropes are made to withstand falls due to their cores being dynamic. I replace my rope about once a year because it finally starts getting worn enough to be worrisome. I'd say the average rope could withstand around 500ish falls as long as they are normal falls sport climbing. If you are taking huge falls with traditional protection then obviously it won't last as long. However, i'd still say on average ropes last around a year or two depending on how often you get out."

"I don't know. I'm sure a good bit of the population could be classified as having some degree of narcissism if my therapist's definition is correct. But I think that is something we probably shouldn't self-diagnose. Having high standards for yourself, alone, doesn't make you a narcissist even under that definition."

"BC here. I watched the news after my mum told me what happened, then called my dad to let him know that my aunt and uncle weren’t going to be able to fly home to Australia that day. Felt sick watching everything unfold, and didn’t eat breakfast. Went to school but mostly just discussed what was happening. So surreal. 

I went to the 9/11 museum in NYC last year, and it brought back a lot of grief from that time. There was so much uncertainty, particularly for a 17 year old just coming into adulthood. "
"Well played!

The short answer, though, is that our brains are unbelievably lazy.  The first time I read your title, I probably didn't even ""see"" more than five words; and of those, I didn't really *read* them, the general outline of loops, ascenders, and descenders is enough to let a native reader ""know"" (sometimes incorrectly) what word they're looking at.

So basically, we don't notice it because it doesn't belong there, and so we don't bother to look at it.  I would dare say this question only got my attention because you quoted the last word, thereby forcing me to slow down and *actually* read it, then I had to go back and figure out what it was referring to."

"It was 1998 and I was taking a biology study abroad class in Costa Rica. I didn’t have my passport when the rest of the class flew out from the US so I had to wait for 4 days until I received a temporary travel visa. 

When I arrived in San Jose I flagged a taxi to take me to the bus station which would take me to Arenal where my group was awaiting my arrival (my university faxed my professor). The driver offered to take me to Arenal for $500 and when I told him I couldn’t afford it he got angry and dropped me off at the wrong bus station. I stood out like a sore thumb with my brightly colored backpack and khakis. When I looked over my shoulder I saw 4 guys trailing me and say in Spanish to hit me and grab the bag. Spanish was spoken by my household as a kid so although I don’t speak it very well I understand it completely. Anyway, with my oversized JanSport on my back I booked it toward the largest group of people near the ticket booths. 

This guy taps me on the shoulder and I thought I was screwed. “Those guys are following you,” it was a US Army soldier visiting his family in Costa Rica. He explained that he’d watched the entire situation and followed me to the ticket booths to help out. He explained that they were more than likely going to jump me and rob me blind and no one would’ve stopped them. But once they saw he was on to them they took off (he was a big fucking dude). He helped me get a taxi to the other bus station and he gave me his family’s telephone number just in case I got in trouble. 
After about a 5 hour bus ride I finally arrived at the base of Arenal in La Fortuna where this guy offered to take me to my camp. While we were diving up the mountain I saw a big tourist bus and made eye contact with some familiar faces. It was my class! I jumped out of the truck and into the bus. I had arrived safe and sound. Oh and btw, they didn’t know I was coming, my school never actually sent the fax to my professor. 

I am eternally grateful to that soldier who helped me. This would’ve been a totally different story had he not arrived. "

"I am not into collecting scissors, but they were (before trash culture) an item that was decorated and made of quality material.  One could see the influence of different styles from different eras on things like these.  Flowery Victorian to art nouveau and so on.  I can certainly see the appeal.  They were a craftsman item.

Edit:  I mean trash culture as disposable.  Can you conceive taking a pair of scissors to a blade smith and paying for them to be sharpened (unless you are *really* into sewing) today?  That used to be a normal thing to do rather than throw them away and buy another pair."

"The whole point from Captain America perspective is that they aren't controlled by any government at all. His entire premise was that if you let regular government officials, who are prone to corruption, control the Avengers then they are no longer what they originally tried to be.

"The difference between facts and opinions. It seems my mom really can't see the difference. I do something she doesn't like and it's wrong.

"The strippers. As a dancer we face so much exploitation at the hands of the club. We pay them to work, we are not given wages, benefits, etc. We are legally independent contractors yet we are treated as employees in the sense that we have to abide by the club’s rules regarding tip outs, schedules, what we can and cannot wear, etc. I never feel exploited by the customers because at the end of the day I only do what I wanna do. The customers have absolutely no say. But I am always at the beck and call of the club and the club managers. I know the club will almost always take the side of a customer because they care about money. I know I am 100% disposable and replaceable to the club. If I do something they deem unacceptable I can be replaced with 5 new dancers within the night. "
"Yeahhh, I'm gonna have to agree with you on this one. You were pretty delicate with the wording which I thought was classy. I gave up world series tickets for my buddies bachelor party. Didn't want to think back on it every time I turned on a game and wonder...hmmm I wonder if I did the right thing. Not that there is an explicit line determining right and wrong here, that was just my train of thought. Like OP's friend, my buddy passed out not two hours in but I can still say I was a part of that. Still watched the highlights on sportcenter that night, but without any guilt or wondering. Not quite sure if our friendship would have been as strong if I had not gone, but who's to say. I'm not OP nor am I her friend, so I guess everyone handles things differently. Hope they are still close

EDIT: after thinking about this for a bit, I don't think it's attending the discussion panel that made me question things. It was the after party/concert part. I get it, it's a pretty big once in a lifetime rarity to have all of these surprise bonuses added on...but so is a best friend's wedding festivities. The panel ended and instead of leaving for her friends party and having the opportunity to say she experienced both, she chose to attend the concert. I don't know, we all think differently and who am I to judge, but the concert/after party decision just seems in poor taste as a friend to me. Again, hope it didn't result in any animosity and they are indeed still close. "
"Don't expect to be able to go from Sydney to the outback for an afternoon walk.  Australia is mahoosive and very spread out.  There's a vast amount of absolute nothingness in the middle.

"When I was first trying substitute teaching I took a job at middle school that I hadn't worked at.  I had heard it had a bad reputation, but I thought nothing of it as I had worked a couple other middle schools with similar schools.

I should have known that it was going to be a problem in the morning when I got to school, two different teachers made a point of telling me that 1st and 4th period would be tough.

First period got off a little rough, but I had it under control until a policeman delivered a student to the class.   Honestly the problem started about ten minutes before that, when the students saw a police car pull up outside and one of their classmates get let out of the back.

They were supposed to be working on some worksheet and they were working in groups.  One of the groups started getting worked up.   I wasn't sure what was up, and I was really that concerned.

Then the student gets dropped of by the officer, who I'm sure had brought her by the office first and was now delivering her to her class, showed her into the class.

I don't recall if he said anything.

That's when one of the girls in the group that had been getting worked up said, ""that bitch thinks she's so bad cause the cops dropped her here; fuck that bitch.""   as she lunged at the girl that had been dropped off by police.

I got between them.  Separated them, called the principle.   Both girls were taken from the class.

The rest of the day went downhill from there.

"I have a friend now whom I dated for a bit in high school. Parents were extremely judgemental of me, didn't like me, and weren't even very comfortable with the fact that we remained friends afterwards.

Fast forward to mid-late 20s and they're nothing but friendly towards me like I'm their best friend, and according to her sister were apparently hoping I'd ask her back out. 

It's funny how sometimes parents just need perspective. I think I was overly judged based purely on the fact that I was one of the first people she dated. After dating some actual assholes, they realized I wasn't so bad.

Edit: as a quick side note, In high school/college every time I saw them I just got the stink eye. Didn't see them for awhile until I was about 25-26. Was preparing myself for some serious stink eye action when the mom rushed up to me and gave me a huge hug, asking how I was doing. My brain couldn't even immediately comprehend what was going on because it was so caught off guard. "
"I find this horrific to type, but...

Without a doubt, Replicate Nazi human trials. Specifically Bone, muscle, nerve transplants, but also stemcells galore. We learnt so much from the freezing trials about what treatments of re-heating can and should be.

To start, we throw human experiments for many types of Cancer, Heart Disease, and some of the high killers first. Throw those already terminal onto crazy experimental drugs ignoring clinical test procedures so the 'chance' one may work/survival will be found. Then we dilute and start again using variants of that drug.

The nazi sea water trials likely found a level of diluted sea water that could sustain the body, but how far could we go. investing into non-pure desalination plants so that it's survivable for periods of time, such as 6 months, 2 years, etc. before renal failure.

"How many times has Batman caught Joker and put him away? How many times has he caught all of his rogues? He has done his part. He is not judge and jury. He doesn't get to decide punishment. He delivers them to those who should, and those people continually fail the city. Gotham fails itself. Why does Bruce need to murder him finally? Why can't Arkham hold him? Corruption erodes any progress.

 Where do you draw the line? So the Joker is a murderer, and so he kills a murderer. So ok, all murderers are now fair game. Kill the murderers. But what about soldiers? Freedom fighters? Revolutionaries? Killing in self defense? Manslaughter? Does Batman decide who is fair game and who isn't? What about drugs? Do you target the suppliers? Dealers? So you kill the dealers. Do dealers and murderers not have families? How many more criminals are created when Batman decides who lives or dies? "
"I'm an EMT and did CCT at the ambulance company I used to work at. First CCT shift was something similar to what you experienced, except it wasn't our patient. We had just transferred care over to the receiving doctor and nurse when screaming commenced. Patient was coming in from Med-Surg (I believe) and coded. We hooked up our monitor, equipment, etc. Our CCT-RN worked at this hospital also and went tearing down the hallway for the crash cart while my partner and I did compressions. The nurse I'd been chatting with 5 minutes earlier was trying (badly) to keep hysterical family members away. We ended up getting the patient back. 

TL;DR: Dropped a patient off at a hospital, another patient goes into cardiac arrest and I do CPR on them in front of their family. 6/10 would do again."

"My partner and I often take late night walks and use the center of the street rather than the sidewalks. She was taught to walk like this, growing up in Baltimore, as a way to put space between yourself and someone stepping out of a side street, alley, or doorway to approach you. They have to cover some distance to get to you, giving you time to assess the situation and react.

I like walking down the street as it gives a better view of our surroundings and a sight-line up into the night sky. "

"&gt; He did do some pretty shitty things though, like have an affair with a married woman.

Obviously this was bad, and a bad decision, but I think it makes him come off as human.  For some reason he just couldn't resist this woman and being around her made him make bad decisions, so it actually says something about his character that he could see that and eventually separate himself from her.  Kind of reminds me of what Tammy does to Ron Swanson, only that's a bit more exaggerated."

"This is only a rumour and happened maybe 20-25 odd years ago just as my parents moved into their new house. I wasn't born at this point or was only a baby., but this story wasn't about our neighbor. 

Bit of context, I live on a street of detached houses, 1960's English estate style, however directly behind our rear fence is large 1400's thatched cottage. 

Now the family living in this old cottage had a couple of VERY loud dogs, according to my parents night after night they would be outside into the early hours of the morning and bark frantically at anything that moved. As you can imagine, the whole street hated them. 

Most people would just ignore this, or make a noise complaint. But no... The old couple who lived maybe two or three doors down from our house, (all of our houses backed onto the cottage and its garden) decided to take things into there own hands. They had a long rivalry with the people in this cottage, something over some overhanging trees. Needless to say, they didn't get on.

One night they broke into the cottage's garden and laid down pieces of meat for the dogs to eat, that meat was laced with poison. Of course nobody ever found out, I'm told the dog owners just assumed they got ill. My parents only learned of this from our neighbors (who knew the culprits well) several years after. They had moved at this point, or died (they were apparently quite old).

Since then, the thatched cottage was changed hands several times, so the family doesn't live hear anymore. Good news is, the new family is finally going to cut down those damn trees!

tl:dr Old man and his wife got pissed off at his neighbor over some trees and dogs barking so he killed them as payback, apparently.

"Skateboarding caused me to burn through shoes, and my dad always have me a hard time (jokingly, mostly) about spending too much of his money on shoes. Years pass, and he tells me he finally spent over $100 on a pair of shoes. ""Now I know why you always wanted to buy expensive shoes."" there was a bit of regret in his voice from buying cheap shoes his whole life. "
"The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness."

"Umm. I live in the US and saw plenty of anti-smoking ads growing up. They *currently involve showing people suffering from the effects of smoking. Like people with holes in their necks to breathe, or there was one where someone had a premature baby that died due to smoking while pregnant.

Thing is, they mostly show up on kids channels or programming targetted at families/teens. You can look up CDC smoking ads.

The biggest issue right now though is definitely vaping. Cigarette smoking rates have declined steadily here but vaping really took off. Huge lack of regulation so I'm afraid we're going to get news stories in a few years talking about all the crap producers are putting in their vape liquids."

Why would you not use that data to draw the reasonable conclusion that the drug is very effective if taken early enough?

"Shark week actually streams a lot of these informational shark facts purposely for shark conservation. They also always say how their purpose is to bring light to all shark species and that they are not as dangerous as you think (to the human, statistically speaking). For the past 4 years they always show NSFW videos of people slaughtering sharks for their fin and then throwing them into the ocean to die, etc. I've learned all of this strictly because of Shark Week. Literally if you google the beginning of shark week, its specific purpose for the show was to let people know sharks aren't these human eating beasts, as Jaws and multiple other sources had made it seem. Its a huge misconception to this day. Shark Week is pro sharks and all for conserving them as many species are endangered also because of commercial and recreational fishing. "

"By not letting shit like that slide when you hear it. By shaking off the fear of ridicule and living how you want to. By not ridiculing others for deviating from Manliness^TM

All these comments in the thread talking about the problems with how “society” treats men. Society is half men. Men are treating other men poorly. 

Men are making prison rape jokes about other men. Men are getting on public media and congratulating child rape victims for being victimized by teachers they think are attractive. 

Men talk about the anguish of not feeling allowed to express emotion, but men are accusing other men of being pussies or gay for doing that. 

Men are the ones by and large making the key and lock jokes that cast sex as something men pursue and take and women as sexually passive beings that are supposed to withhold and be convinced to give into it. That feeds the bias of who is the aggressor and who is the victim in these situations. 

Men are basing their own self worth on sexual conquest and sexual ability and then men who don’t embody that ideal for whatever reason feel less-than and isolated and are sometimes even driven to kill themselves or others.

The Man^TM box wouldn’t be in place still unless men were policing themselves and each other back into it. 

It seem like it should be an uncontroversial opinion that even “positive” gender roles have dark sides. You can’t keep the positives and think you’ll be free of the negatives. If we broke down these prescribed boxes and let everyone just be themselves, we’d all be better for it.

It’s confusing to me how people will be unhappy with the status quo of gender roles, but get very defensive at the idea they should go away.

"Obligatory not my son/daughter but my older sister. She has dated nothing but losers her entire life even though she attracts all of the good people. She must have low self-esteem or something. Idk why she likes all the douches. 

She left the house at 18 and moved elsewhere. Not long after she met her fiancé, who definitely sells weed. They’ve been together ever since, and she’s 33 now. She’s a dumbass so when he was about to leave her she got pregnant to stop him. He’s a misogynist so the fact that she gave him a son made him happy. Then she gave him another son a year later, on accident. So she had him firmly trapped for god knows why. 

He is an abusive piece of shit and I hate his guts. I hate him with all my heart. And I hate what my sister has done to herself. He paid for their living expenses for four years after the kids were born while my sister got a two year nursing degree and  took care of kids. After that, it was mostly her paying for everything with whatever he decided to give her. She barely got him to watch kids on weekends. Our mom was the main babysitter. 

So basically he believes that the man is the one in charge, so my sister cooks for him every night and does all the house chores, raises the kids, gets them to school, works, pays living expenses. He’ll give her like an extra $200 every month and babysits reluctantly on weekends if he feels like it. 

He has physically harmed her, broke her shit, cursed at her, manipulated her, and cheated on her. But she forgave the cheating. Forgave everything. She was even in denial when he hit their autistic son with a belt and the marks were there and she said he just scratched their son by accident. Even when he came crying to us that his dad hit him because his fucking dad doesn’t understand that he is going to be slower than the average kid and he can’t read the fucking Bible and he doesn’t always put his shoe on the right foot. My nephew is fucking terrified of him and the one that isn’t autistic has straight out told us that he would rather have his father dead than alive. During the summer my autistic nephew would beg us to take them on days when dad was babysitting. Because he doesn’t fucking feed them so my nephews have to feed themselves when they are just kids. They can’t even talk to him without getting yelled at. What a fucking piece of shit he is. 

Yes, we reported this loser to child services. They checked up my nephews and his daughter with his ex (yes, my sister is raising the daughter too of course) and they deemed the case not worthy enough for action. 

I am so sick of his existence in our lives. I just want him to leave and never come back. But he has it too good. She takes care of him. She’s his slave. 

My sister is one of my favorite people and she is so charismatic, funny and beautiful. I cry when I think of what she has gotten herself into. I wish she didn’t do this to herself. She could have done so much more. She’s so smart and talented. She could do anything. She deserves so much more. 

Fuck her piece of shit fiancé. "

"I’m 26, so I’m like to a decade removed from this. In my experience transitioning from teenager to adult, it seemed like the people who weren’t expected to act like adults as teenagers continued to act like teenagers as adults. If no one expects you to take accountability for your actions until you turn 18, you won’t be able to deal with it when it counts. I don’t know if that’s a perfect parenting strategy, but keep in mind that the adults in your life know that you aren’t an adult. They’re trying to prepare you for what life will throw at you. If they earnestly believed that you had already crossed the line into being an adult, you would get evicted for not paying rent. 

Basically, asking teenagers to act like adults is how you teach them how to act like adults. It’s a painful process, but otherwise you might not have the tools to flourish independently later in life."

"I had a friend in elementary school that my mom warned me not to hang around with because he was a troubled child.  Of course, he became my best friend.  At the time I couldn't understand what being an adopted, abused kid meant, nor did I understand what else might be going on inside this kid's head.  He was reckless, offensive, spiteful and had no boundaries.  His favorite games to play were damaging/stealing neighbors property and blowing up small animals with firecrackers.  A lot of it creeped me out and I'd make up excuses to have to be home when he got off the rails.  By sixth grade he'd disappeared and I never saw him again.  Thirty years forward, I bumped into his step-brother and asked how my friend was, what became of him.  He told me he was a guest of the state of California and would probably remain so for the rest of his life.  He had lost his shit and beat someone to death at age 24.  As an adult, looking back, I was not the least bit surprised.  As a kid, hanging out with him, I never would have imagined it despite the way he acted then - a ten year old doesn't understand the warning signs.  "

OP never said 'women' were evil. He said based on what we know, that individual is an evil little emotionally manipulative guttersnipe.

"Your original question is about not ""offending them"", though. If a person is behaving rudely they forfeit their general right to sensitivity from others. 

One thing most women aren't comfortable doing, but most men are, is shifting gears from ""polite social exchange"" to ""aggression mode"" as the situation merits. When a person is hassling you over your repeated, clear objections, you are not having a polite conversation. They are aggressing against you. They are trying to coerce or manipulate you. Think like a man: *this is now a fight*.

You respond with aggression, albeit perhaps minimal aggression, in order to assert your boundaries, demand respect, and repel the aggressor. Now the way you do this depends very much on the details of where you are and what you are doing. But not ""offending"" is exactly the opposite of what you need to do. Offend. Defend. Repel. 

None of this should be necessary regularly, but hey.. some people did a crap job raising their kids. "

"Funny story about dumpster diving

When I was about 14 me and a friend saw that their was a dumpster in front of a liquor store that went out of business. We checked it and saw a whole lot of beer and wine coolers.

"Dammit Sanderson, stop making random cool universes out of short stories.   First snapshot and now this"
"This needed to be said and needs to be said again and again until these irresponsible people stop posting these kinds of pictures. 

I took some law classes in college and depending on the specific laws in each state, posting any picture of a child that contains nudity can be considered producing or distributing child pornography in the eyes of the law, even though these parents aren't intending it that way. 

It just seems like it's easier not to post them at all. At best, no one wants to see your kid taking a bath. At worst, someone really does want to see it and when that person is eventually caught, the parent who posted the photo to begin with is implicated and gets charged with reckless endangerment of a minor by a person in a position of trust. When they could just not post those photos and avoid all the bs that comes with it.

Ross - See Monica, their family was nice and seemingly well off (dad was a dentist IIRC) so that cushion coupled with what seems to be a decent position as a paleontologist at a museum (and later a tenure track professor at NYU) explains him.

Also at show start, average for a 2 bedroom apartment in the Village would have only been around 2,500 a month, so given the backgrounds, it's doable and not the most asinine handwave in TV history.

"I worked as a bartender at very busy bars in New Orleans for a long time, and a hand on the back around elbow level to show you are on another bartender's back (i.e. standing right behind them), or a hand dragged along the back to show directional movement behind them, or a light tap on one side or the other to let them know you working right on a specific side of them, was absolutely necessary. Behind a tight, busy bar, touch clues are almost mandatory as necessary nonverbal communication, and without them, collisions would occur constantly.

For instance, I saw one of our bartenders who didn't use the trick with other men not ""touch"" a big beefy bartender and he got knocked out by a bottle to the face when the beefy guy turned quickly while making a drink just as non-toucher guy was bending to grab a bottle from the rail. You move hard and fast when speed bartending. Non-verbal location communication prevents the spilling of both alcohol AND blood.

What I am trying to say is, sometimes touching like you're describing is expected and necessary at a job. But not ass groping, or boob grazing, or face caressing, or any touching of intimate parts. That has no place anywhere.

For example, a shitty male bartender used to grab me by my hips and push me this way or that instead of just touching my back to let me know where he was. The hips are many women's center of gravity, myself included, so even a fairly light shove at the hips would throw me off balance. The sexist territorial-ness infuriated me and the intimacy of being grabbed by the hips made me cringe. I eventually got into an drunk, after-hours yelling match with him about it following a particularly busy shift and demanded that he never touch me in any way that he wouldn't touch our male coworkers. He acted like I was being unreasonable, but he stopped touching me like that. Man, just remembering the way he would touch me makes me mad all over again!"

Well after our breakup, fast forward about a year, I found myself without any shows to binge. My brother gave me access to his HBO Now account so I decided, what the hell, why not try it.

Man oh man am I glad I did. It is easily, hands down, one of the greatest television experiences of my entire life. I never wanted it to be over. I think about all the hype surrounding GoT when I didn’t really know what it was, and it is every bit as good as they say and then some.

"Vaguely older dude chiming in: there's nothing inherently racist about making a statement about a country or culture. It's judging or acting against an individual without knowing them based on the culture they come from that's a problem in my opinion. I know it's a sensitive issue right now, but as someone who was born into a very poor family in a poor neighborhood, I've both seen a lot of institutional racism and been victim to individual racism. It just hurts me to see people ignore the real issue of race or class relations in favor of making a big deal out of things that aren't, which seems to happen a lot recently"

Good to hear. I've been slowly trying to cut my mom out of my life because she's toxic as hell. It sucks because all my siblings but 1 still live with her and I'd rather not go over there to see them since she's always around. She's been rude ever since I moved out last year to live with my gf and treats her like shit but in a passive aggressive way and tries to cover her ass if you call her out on it. At this point I'm considering just completely cutting her out

What was that comment earlier in the thread about arguing with strangers on the internet?
"Oh? doesn't sound bad. My ex was toxic, mentally abusive and manipulative. I was joking with a guy at a party and she told me she was leaving me cause I was gay. I told her I definitely wasn't gay, and still was constantly having sex with her. The man at the party was a friend of the family, we were joking about trans porn or something ridiculous... She said, ""Ask \*your best friend!\* (at the time) he said what you did was gay too! ... After hours, and days, and weeks, of torture, not knowing what was going on inside of her head, she just moved out. Couple months later I find out she boned best friend, few months after that picks my daughter up in his truck (wtf?), couple months later moves in with him, month later engaged. 

You want to see a man almost on the verge of killing some people and not giving a shit about jail afterwards? The pure frustration she put me through the entire relationship was enough to go insane. This was just the end of it. Now I have to pick daughter up at their place/ talk to her constantly about daughter.. she tells me its been 10 months since we broke up, and to get over it.   


Bonus? I have my daughter 75% of the time cause she is a pos. Its the only thing that has kept me sane.

Anyways one day, she decided she was pissed and didnt talk to me and would actively leave the room when I would enter it.

She ended up getting me blackballed at the park, which is funny because she just stopped showing up shortly after beginning the following year. "
"The answer to this is a famous farmer saying ""stop looking forward to next years harvest"".

You need to stop and enjoy today and stop chasing some life that may never come. Or spend your whole life excited for ""someday"" and forget to enjoy ""today"".

Plus, if your fairytale life involves anything material (house, car, vacations, etc) then I got news for you, you fucking got it wrong.

Your fairytale life should be tat you have the time and the means to pursue PURPOSE. Whatever that is, slamming the food drive with food, teaching poverty kids math, running your own charity, whatever it is, do it. But I have news for you all, if your goal involves something shallow that takes money to buy ""a huge house, etc"", then you need to change your mindset.

Money is just the tool you need to remove your dependance on having to work. This frees up your TIME. Time that you can apply to helping people, and bringing purpose into your life. If you aren't working towards that, you'll never be happy.

You can impact that ""money"" requirement both by working hard, but more importantly by saving money, and/or changing your lifestyle so that you don't need so damn much. Nothing in my life that matters cost a fucking cent. Except for those kids, those fuckers drain me. Those lovable, adorable, irreplaceable little assholes."

The sex wasn't even worth it once I realized how fulfilling life could be without any toxic behavior in it.

"Outpatient stuff is pretty minimal on that, so is psychiatry. Dermatology.

But that's life, the reason medicine pays the big bucks is because most everyone in it is doing shit nobody wants to do. The neurosurgeon does not want to start a 12 hour surgery on an acute patient at three in the morning every four nights, but someone has to do it or this patient dies. This involves anesthesiologists, nurses, CNAs, midlevels, techs. Everyone is on the team.

"Really all I did was look at my behavior, examine the causes, and address them in order to become closer to the person I want to be. Unfortunately the catalyst for this process was the failure of my marriage.

I figured my marriage didn't fail for no reason, so I spent months thinking about what it might be, trying to be as objective as possible. During my introspection I discovered some very negative traits that, once I recognized them, disgusted me. Just stopping the behaviors that come from those traits wasn't working, so I researched and talked to people with similar experiences to determine what was going on behind the scenes, so to speak, and work on becoming a better person.

My work is nowhere near done. That being said, just the act of recognizing my shortcomings and working to correct them showed me that I don't deserve the self-hatred I was experiencing. I've come to the conclusion, in my case, that if I'm not improving myself, I'm losing progress. There is no maintaining.

As for tips: Talk to a professional. There's an idiotic stigma attached to seeing a therapist, but that profession exists for a reason. Find one you feel you can trust and be comfortable talking to. It will make a world of difference."

"She ended up screwing up the whole inventory count off by entering the inventory onto the wrong lines in the program.  It showed our store losing like 30% of our product and caused a huge inquiry.

Then she started spouting off about a bunch of other bullshit of how I screwed other things up, (ordering too much product, encouraging employees to steal, closing the store early, etc).  She completely tried throwing me under a bus until the regional manager pulled me aside and I was able to provide proof that not only was I not there that night (Scheduled off, no clock-in records, proof that I was at a movie that night with ticket stubs), but also able to debunk every pile of shit she threw my way.

At the end of the summer, I left for a trip to Europe. I realized how much I missed him and we even skyped while I was there.

T-Mobile customer service representatives either truly don't know or aren't allowed to tell the percentage of tax put on a phone. I'm not stupid, I know it doesn't ""change depending on when we look at it"". Tax is a steady percent of the cost of the phone, and the cost \*could\* vary, but the percent of the price that is tax doesn't change. "

"Gender, race, and orientation are definitely a huge part of what people are.

And they’re universally the 3 most common forms of discrimination in this world: sexism, racism, and phobia of “anyone that isn’t cis or hetero”, because they’re the 3 biggest identifiers (as in, things that make us the most ‘different’ to each other).

I don’t understand why some people act like you shouldn’t make it your identity. Especially when there’s huge cultural norms tied to masculinity, femininity, every possible race, and every sexuality.

Most LGBT people break the restrictive norms of what it means to be masculine and feminine. Of course we’re gonna make it our identity."

"Other than his recent album being mostly commercial, what's ""fake"" about him? He was a kid having fun and managed to become famous from it. Everyone thought he was a one hit but he managed to keep his fame.

Not all rap songs need to have some deep meaning that connects to the rapper's life. YBN raps about stuff he doesn't do and admitted in an interview that it's all just for fun.

""Culture Vulture"". Because he's white and raps? Because he doesn't identify as a rapper? It's just a guy having some fun, everyone always finds a reason to hate on somebody. If it's not your cup of tea then just ignore it."

"I have to jump in just to say you are being an obvious contrarian, and it's cringy.  It's fine if you like the DCEU movies.  Everyone is entitled to their own taste.  It's demonstrable, though, that people *overall* do not enjoy DCEU movies as much as MCU movies.  To say otherwise is intellectual dishonesty.

&gt;Of course the MCU has more good movies, they have more movies.

That's not even a logically sound statement.  The amount of movies a franchise has does not equate to having more *good* movies.  The Sharknado series as 6 movies now, so by your logic it has the same number of good movies as the DCEU?

I think it's a popular stance that Wonder Woman is by far the best DCEU movie, and it would be in the bottom-tier of MCU quality.  It has nothing to do with the number of movies each franchise has.

"I've recently got on the ""meal replacement shake"" train and it seems to be the best option.

Cooking every day sucks. Unless you want to waste far too much time, you make quick shitty meals. Meal prepping sucks because you still put in effort, but have to keep eating the same meal, except old and reheated.

So if I'm not willingly to spend the time to cook a good meal, might as well just skip it all together. Fairly healthy, reasonably priced (way cheaper than eating out), incredibly quick."
"I'm totally with you on that. I either take the time to make a fresh and delicious meal or I eat things that don't require a lot of prep. At the end of the day there's no practical difference between the two as far as calories and nutrition are concerned. I'd rather eat some meats, cheeses, and veggies as a snack than microwave a several-day old prepared meal."

"I forget where I read it, but if I remember correctly, there's also a financial incentive to getting users to sort materials.

And there's been no discernable effect on my mental state, aside from being very slightly annoyed that she insists on making the bed.

If it helps you, then I sincerely think that's awesome. Likewise for anyone else who feels the same. Especially if it helps people battle depression. Seriously, I wish you well in that. I just wish people would stop repeating this as if it's some universal truth."

"&gt; I don't think most people use the term ""classic rock"" to imply rock that has become a classic. It's basically a genre; Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd etc.

I hate it with an irrational burning passion though, which is probably while it bothers me so much when people go ""har har, Nirvana is classic rock now"". "
"Thing is the main defense against things like MLMs are just being informed, far far more than not being ‘stupid’. Most of the SMURT redditors here would fall for it, if not for it being widely publicized as a well known scam.  

MLMs, Ponzi schemes, etc... might be ‘obvious’ now that the warning signs have been drilled many people’s heads, but they were famously successful scams for a reason.  They weren’t very obvious without the forewarning from hindsight that we have now.  It isn’t that generation z or gamma or whatever we’re on now have evolved bigger brains than the kids and young adults of the past.

All it takes is for someone to be less informed for whatever reason - people around them, being too poor to browse the internet all day, etc... and a perfectly intelligent person can end up falling for it, at least the first time. "

Those are rewarding, but they take work, and so both participants should show some interest in having that kind of conversation before one of them deep dives into it, imo."
"It has nothing to do with hiding your past for most people saying that.  Of course you're going to have a past and talk about it some day, everyone does.  But if you bring your ex up on the first few (generally 3) dates, the chances that you aren't over them is too high to be worth the risk for most people.

Rule to tell what age the movie is for at a glance:

If the romantic subplot has the heroine leaving their current person for a new love, it's a grownups' movie.

If the romantic subplot has the heroine leaving their new love to go back to their ex, it's a kids' movie. 

Because seriously, how many movies like that had the happy ending""the parents get back together"", even though we just spent 90 minutes seeing that the ex-husband was an annoying manchild piece of crap and the mother's new man was...actually an allright guy, all things considered. Maybe a little boring, but if she had just gotten away from this psycho, you can absolutely see why she'd pick a more boring, safe guy like that."

"Yeah, as I understand it, my attacker was on some intravenous steroids while on hospital for a week prior to the attack. He’d recently been diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease on top of other conditions, of which I’m not aware. He was behaving oddly (talking loudly, arguing with his wife more) prior to the attack, and I suspect that he might have discharged himself against medical advice, though he did return with some further steroidal medications to continue his treatment. Also, whether he discharged himself is conjecture, he returned home on the bus. He didn’t tell anyone he was being discharged, he just showed up. And then three days later, he tried to kill us all.

From a purely legal perspective (I’m a law student, hence my thinking), I wonder if the doctors that treated him might be liable for negligence in a civil suit, or if not them, then the drug manufacturers. Trying to kill your wife is a pretty hardcore side effect. God knows it’s irrevocably changed their lives."

"The thing is, those on the pro gun side tend to see guns as tools, and the gun control side tends to see guns as weapons. And if you see a gun as a weapon, ""responsible exposure"" isn't going to do much to change that opinion. 

I'm actually anti 2A. Not because I want to ban guns, but because I feel that turning gun legislation over to the states is the only way to get gun legislation that will be satisfactory to more people. What's ""common sense"" in rural Alaska doesn't necessarily work in NYC and vice versa."

First time smoking it, I'm on my highschool senior trip, on top of the world, and it was a great experience, giggling, not hallucinating, but imagining things so hard I felt they were real, is the best way to put it. 2nd time, first year of college, extremely stressed and anxious, no really bad hallucinations but it was an agonizing 20-30mins."

"Samantha came out of nowhere, she could see I was physically feeling her presence and how I just became a vulnerable mush around her. 

Her girlfriend and her came over to my house one day, and she looks right at me and tell's me she is into me. We started making out in front of everyone, so they collectively decided to leave the room. 

At the moment, her and I was all that existed, the rest of the world melted away and we were lost into each other. 

Then I found out she had a boyfriend back home the next day when she came over and I became so upset I screamed at her to leave. I saw her twice afterwards in public and I still felt all those emotions for her.  "

"Because(and I'm not defending this behaviour) in some places dogs as well as cats are a utility, a tool, without the emotional value that we usually place on them. A chained dog is just an alarm system for intruders. It's meant to bark when it notices something, everything else(including its own wellbeing) is completely irrelevant. Same as keeping outside cats on a farm - they are there to catch mice, you don't feed them or interact with them - they are there to do a job. If something kills it(a wild animal usualy) you just get another one."

"Man, I was in 6th grade at the time. Public school and very close to Fort Knox military base in KY. I knew nothing of the attacks until I got home. They didn't make an announcement, or turn the TV on or anything. My mom worked at an oil lab at the time on Fort Knox, and I remember calling her after school to ask if I could go over to a friend's house. She was like ""uh we had a terrorist attack today, no."" So the first time I heard about it was at like 3:30pm after she said no, and I turned on the TV. 

It was craziness. I remember complaining to the school the next day. How could you guys not let us know? It was bizarre, but I vividly remember the day playing out still... "

"Not a trucker, but a son of one. Nonetheless, this story isn't about him. This goes back to 2007, I was roughly 20 years old. The drive was through a semi-rural area; a single lane, smooth road called 52, which connects Pennsylvania to Delaware. 52 also connects to ""Devil's Road"", where M. Night filmed, ""The Village"". It was typically an eerie commute, but due to me using it often, it never truly scared me. Girlfriend at the time was riding with me in the passenger seat and we were traveling back to Delaware after dropping off my best pal in Pennsylvania, who'd joined us to see a movie. It was 2 am at the time, we had recently crossed the state line. Despite being young and stupid, I reduced my speed slightly due to the dense fog which we had quickly entered. Before I knew it, my heart was racing. I found myself swerving as to not hit a person in the middle of the road. It was an apparition-like woman with long hair, covered in worn, white robes with a dim glow to her entire appearance. She was kneeling down and slowly rising. I didn't quite get a good look at her face, but perhaps that's what makes the fear linger on. I recall saying, ""Holy shit! Did you see that?!"" To which my girlfriend agreed, nodding with an open mouth and wide eyes.

Additionally, this girl I was dating at the time claimed to have a ghost living in a room of her family's home, a room which they would seldom enter."

"The question remains: are you content with the results in 2016? If so, don't vote in 2018 or 2020, you'll get more of the same.

The Republican party relies on low voter turnout among non-Republicans. They craft laws to try to reduce turnout. You're just helping them if you don't vote. Non-Republicans outnumber Republicans in this country, but, a larger proportion of non-Republicans can't be bothered to vote, so, that's why we are where we are.

If you're not happy with the way things are, vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with your beliefs. It is true that one vote rarely makes the entire difference, but, it is completely 100% inaccurate that your vote has no power. The only way your vote has no power is if you leave it in your back pocket. The elections are not rigged (yet?). Votes still matter.

You'll never get a candidate that you 100% agree with. If you don't vote, politicians will feel free to ignore what you want. Why bother crafting a platform plank for you? You don't matter (to them, you matter to me) if you don't vote."

"Ok. I'm bisexual, I want to offer my perspective on this.

I didn't date men for awhile, because I saw them as selfish liars who only wanted to get in my pants, and had the potential to be abusive. So I only dated women. But then, I had women who weren't sure they were into other women, lead me on and pursued me just to break my heart, ghosted me after dating awhile. Women suck, I thought. Guess I'll settle for men, at least they want to be with me, even if it's for something as superficial as sex. Had more bad experiences with men. Then I realized, no one gender is better or worse than the other. There are shitty people everywhere, there are people who can't handle their issues everywhere, one gender isn't gonna magically have a lesser amount of problems.

Also, you aren't special. You aren't the first person to struggle to find a relationship. You aren't the first person that's been hurt by multiple people. Men and women, of every orientation, have been saying the same things FOREVER. I've heard straight men complain about women, straight women frustrated with men, gay men talk about how difficult men are, lesbians saying ""fucking women"" as they vent about their latest romantic endeavor. Finding someone that is a good person, and compatible with you, can be hard. It takes time for most people to find someone. It takes trial and error to learn about other people, and behaviors to avoid.

Finally, not all of the blame is on other people either. Often, some of the blame also resides in yourself. And I don't mean that in the ""everyone has flaws"" kind of way, although that is part of it too. Ask yourself, do you usually go for the same kind of person? Or are there certain red flags that you consistently ignore? Do you have some of your own problems that may lead you to being with shitty people? I spoke before about my relationship experience, it took me awhile to realize that I had many times gone for people who were manipulative, controlling, etc, because I had low self esteem, I wanted to be wanted, I wasn't assertive, and I didn't know how to effectively stand up for myself. Once I realized this, and how these problems lead me to the wrong sorts of people, I could have better judgement of if a person was a good decision to date.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps. Don't fall into the traps of sexism, it doesn't help yourself, it doesn't help your relationships, it doesn't help other people."

"Yeeeeah, no.  
Most of the time that conversation will end at ""hi"" / ""hi"" if you don't continue it with something else. People will expect you to follow up with something after a simple ""hi"" because you're the one who initiated the conversation.  
Starting a conversation with that is good, and usually the only acceptable way to start it, but you can't just say that and expect the other person to initiate a meaningful conversation with you.  

Basically, saying ""hi"" is just the first hit that's gonna make a small crack in the ice, but it will never break it by itself."

For people who don't understand: Picture looking out a gate window with a plane at it.

"I would love to create multiple enclaves (country within a country) inside the US with nearly identical demographics representative of the US as a whole. These enclaves would be make up of volunteers who live their lives just as they would have before with the same jobs, families, etc. but maybe earning more than they would normally as incentives to volunteer. 

Anyways, each enclave would have its own government/economic systems that are entirely independent from that of the US. The idea being that communists, socialists, liberals, conservatives, etc. all have complete autonomy over one enclave where they can create their utopian structure. With everything else being the same (GDP, population, industries) the consequences of each government will be undeniably apparent.

You maintain 100% open communication with your husband right up until you don't, right up until the conversations become more frequent and more risque. You are literally flirting with disaster over some fuckboi.

You just wanna keep playing with fire. Cause it's fun. And you like how it burns. But you won't burn yourself. But you could take it off. It'd be really easy.

"It's all the nonsense that comes out of academia these days. They look at everything through a lens of power dynamics and collectivism. So to them racism isn't just prejudice of other races, but prejudice + power. Then it collectivizes these dynamics along lines of race, sex, social class etc. So since white people as a collective hold the most power they are also the most racist, homophobic etc.

It doesn't make any sense when you apply any amount of critical thought to it, because the collectivism erases all nuance to the examination of power. It completely ignores the fact that the power dynamics between individuals aren't decided along collective lines but constantly shift. Someone who has no power one instance can have all the power the next, so nobody should be excused for holding hatred in their heart. "

"I like to play lawful good characters because that’s usually easy for me.  The kind of character that goes “Yes, I will help you” to darn near anything.  One of the other players likes to make unholy mixes and matches of all sorts of things.  This game, he decided to be a a cleric that didn’t learn any spells, but instead carried rings and whose life mission was to marry (to clarify, make two people married, I struggled with that a lot) as many people as possible.  I think he also spec’d solely into grappling too, just to show how much he liked to screw with people (the DM in particular).  

We had a girl in the group for maybe the first time since I started playing.  He spent the entire session trying to get different NPCs to marry, then finally turned to me and the girl and tried to marry us.

I didn’t know what to say because I felt like saying “No” would have been an insult and saying “Yes” may have led to people thinking that I fancied her in real life.  It got to the point that almost everyone on the table was like “Yeah, you two should get married!” until, to my great relief, someone piped up and said “He can’t.  Paladins can’t get married”.  I feel like the DM knew this already and wanted to screw with me a little, but he acknowledged the rule and everyone went back to the game while I relaxed from my dumbstruck state.

A flick through a rulebook later that night reassured me that the issue wouldn’t raise its head again and that I should stick to my Paladin ways forevermore!  Or at least until the DM moved to China and we all stopped playing.

And that was the day Just Bill dodged a bullet."

"Yeet is a beautiful and commnly misused word. It is very flexible and can take many parts of speech.

However, it's tenses are often used incorrectly. In the future, you ""will yeet,"" In the present you ""are yeeting,"" and in the past, ""you yote.""

""Yote"" is often replaced with ""yeeted,"" but that is a prime example of poor grammar. Using ""yeeted"" instead of ""yote"" would be like saying ""eated"" instead of ""ate."" It makes you sound like a baby or a moron.

""Yeet"" as a verb

1.    ⁠to make a violent motion of any variety, such as a ""whip,"" or any motion that may be associated with violent camera shake or photo blur.
2.    ⁠""Yeet"" is quite commonly used as a verb for the specific purpose of throwing an object forcefully over a long distance.
3.    ⁠""Yeet"" can also be used as something you'd include in a sentence to describe what happened to someone who has been greatly or suddenly defeated in a competition such as sports or a video game.

""Yeet"" as a pro-sentence

1.    ⁠In this case, ""yeet"" takes the role of ""yes."" You'd say ""yeet"" instead of ""yes"" or ""yeah"" if you want people to know you're fun and hip.

""Yeet"" as an exclamation

1.    ⁠This form of ""yeet"" can be exclaimed in any situation where the verb form could be used to describe the action in which the speaker is currently partaking. For instance, if you throw something violently or hit a nasty whip, you may exclaim ""Yeet!"" while doing so.

Edit: I didn't type this, this was a copypasta I found somewhere."

Yesss my favourite comedian of all-time.
The “nice guys” are the assholes.
"So I work in a comic book store. We had this group of guys who would come in and play DnD or magic in the back of the store in our game room. This one guy who always brought his two daughters who didn’t care about DnD nor magic. They would have to spend 3 plus hours at a comic shop they didn’t want to be at. Meanwhile the dad is so occupied in the game that he doesn’t watch them. One of the girls who is 5 years old comes back into the back office. We have a bathroom to the right then an office to the left in the back. This little girl goes into the office. Then proceeds to shit on the floor. Fucking 5 years old and shitting on the floor. We don’t even notice until later when someone walks back there near the end of the night. 

We had to ban that guy from gaming at our shop if he has his kids with him. He tried arguing it wasn’t his kid who did that but we have a camera in the office so we know for certain is was his child. It was one of the grosses days working at the store. Luckily I didn’t have to clean it up. "

"I am a younger (early thirties) dad of a fourteen year old son. And he says many of the same things, but i remind him. If i don't treat you like an adult now, when will you learn to be an adult? I get being a kid and having fun and all, but the school system doesn't teach how to balance a budget, so I have him help. We have adult conversations about why a decision was made. I am raising an adult, not a child."
My god. 
"TL:DR at the bottom

Not me but a friend. Her sister told her that if you (accidentally) banged your elbow, you had to bang your other elbow straight away or else it's bad luck. She told her this when my friend was about 6-8yrs old. 

Fast forward 25(ish)yrs and my friend accidentally bangs her elbow in work. Then straight away slams her other elbow against the desk (with a look of 'I don't want to do this but I have to' on her face). Cue me with a ""WTF?"". Friend goes on to explain about it being bad luck if you don't bang your other elbow, sister told her, etc etc. 

Inform my friend that ""think your sister's messing with you"" whilst dying of laughter. 

Friend phones her sister to prove me wrong, sister laughs and say ""who told you shit like that?? Haha.."" Friend says ""You did. About 25yrs ago."" 

Sister ends up having to hang up the phone as was unable to talk as she was laughing so much. 

My friends face once she thought about needlessly banging her elbow to inflict pain on herself for all these years. ಠ_ಠ 

TL:DR friend's sister tells little lie when they were young children. Friend belives it and continues to enact the lie into adult life, spending 25(ish)yrs inflicting unnecessary pain on herself."

"IDK I'm 18 and I used the internet my whole life practically. The internet isn't just ""juice that makes my apps go"". I never had dial-up but I'm very very used to using the internet itself vs using apps that use internet. If a 17 year old doesn't know/care that the internet is useful for things besides powering apps then they probably lived under a rock until 3 years ago and then they were given a smartphone and nothing else when they came out from under there."

I think it is a real addiction. I would label it as more of an obsession though. There are people that can’t go a day without looking at or masturbating to it. I enjoy porn just like the next person but I don’t look at it every chance that I get so I wouldn’t consider that an addiction.

"Every once in a while on very small commercial planes they actually have to take the total weight limit into consideration. On wide-body jets I don't think that comes up.

I was already boarded on a little puddle-jumper (30-40 person capacity) that was flying from Peoria to Chicago. We were still at the gate, when the attendant came on the speaker and said they were over their weight capacity (not overbooked; this is important). After she said this, they called my name to come to the front of the plane where they told me I'd need to be rescheduled on another flight because of the planes capacity. Because they came over the speaker and *told* everyone they were over their weight capacity while there are still a couple empty seats on the plane, and then called me (all 6'6"" 290 lbs of me) up to be put off the plane, I know I must have looked like a complete land whale. Like, here's this galoot who's too big to fly on a plane that still has a couple empty seats. If they had just called me up without telling the entire cabin that there was too much weight on the plane, then no big deal. But, alas..."
"Not OP but when I need shoes, I go to a shop that sells shoes and try them until I find a pair that I like and fits. There are thousands upon thousands of brands, and going to a specific branded store usually just means paying more for the same thing with a different logo on it.

I have no idea what brand the shoes I'm wearing are without looking at the label."
Ah okay.  Thanks for the clarification.
"So, there I was, in Carl's Jr, waiting for my order when nature called. I answered the call by excusing myself to the restroom.

&amp;#x200B;

The restroom door had a brushed steel fascade, and it looked much heavier than it actually was. I gave it a little push and the door flew open and crashed into the wall behind, as though Thor himself had just arrived. As much as it startled me, the real victim was the young boy washing his hands. He froze and stared at me wide eyed, hands half lathered and water running. The door to the restroom opened directly to the sink and the door swung open right next to it.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yikes! Sorry about that..."" I stammered.

&amp;#x200B;

The boy resumed his washing and I found my way to the urinal, which was next to the sink and separated by a small divider. I was quickly lost in that supreme natural pleasure of emptying one's bladder when I heard the boy leave. He also slammed the door open, but I didn't hear it close. Thinking this was odd, I looked up and realized the door was stuck open, out of my reach. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, if the angles didn't all line up to give me a perfect line of sight into the dining room, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

I peered awkwardly at the diners, enjoing their burgers, fries and the entertainment (me), smiled sheepishly and tried to finish up. I swear, one older hispanic abuelita even politely waved.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished up, washed my hands, and got my dine in order to go."

"When I was a teenager, I was friends with a very sweet guy, we occasionally went out for coffee, lunches and generally hung out with other friends. I started to date a guy, who was a brother of another friend, for a few weeks. Everyone got along, or so I thought. About 1.5-2 years later, (not dating friends brother anymore) my very sweet guy friend was murdered by 3 people. One of those 3 people was my ex (the friend's brother I dated) . I don't remember all the details but I think it had to do with drugs. They all ended up in prison some 20+ years. I really didn't see that coming. He was released this year, set up a Facebook and getting his life back, I suppose. "

"Unfortunately a negative consequence of the age we live in is that young people are often being taught more about sex through pornography than sex ed. That inevitably results in attempts to recreate what they see, and oftentimes the things done in pornography are not at all okay in real life, especially not without consent. 

This is a question of education about consent and communication. We're doing young people a disservice by not properly educating them on these issues. "

Theres a very good reason religions have been the defining characteristic of EVERY culture on the planet for the past thousands of years.  Its not that people are so dumb and they want to hear stories of imaginary ghosts.  Its because the structure that religion enables makes the culture much stronger than it would be otherwise.  Theres no replacement for that (we are trying damn hard with capitalism but... well... its just not working out)"

I make sure to tell him that I wish he’d be more thoughtful about cleaning, and we’re at a point where he at least recognizes that he doesn’t have the same cleaning impulse that I do.

"I didn't give them a reason, as I did not want to upset the kids. The father barely spoke English, so I just kept bantering away with his sons about their purchase, video games, etc, making it seem like I was just heavily wrapped up in conversation as I escorted them out the door.  


I had to follow them to the front to raise the gate anyways, and I felt that escorting them to their car felt like the right thing to do. Little did they know that despite my cheery poker face demeanor, I was still very much scared out of my mind, and my right hand that was casually stuffed in my pants pocket was actually holding a loaded firearm.  


The Spanish speaking father seemed confused though that I had followed them all the way to their car (maybe he thought I was going home with them? lol). I'm still relieved to this day that nothing escalated beyond what happened. I could never live with myself if gunfire had broken out between myself and the perpetrator while an innocent family and unaware employee was just meters away.

"Weirdly enough I was in the exact same boat with my last job of 3 years. Went from a team of 80,to 50, to 2. Kept getting responsibilities piled on, being made to do things outside of my job function, and then finding out that new hires were getting paid 10-15% more than me. Dusted off my resume and found an incredibly healthy environment with a massive boost to pay. Cheers to us three! Keep on moving onward and upwards!"
Hi Dave
The movie really wasn’t that bad.  It’s a great science-fiction movie.  It was horribly marketed.

"I’m on the same boat... I’ll tell you how I’ve come to see it:

People say “you’ll get over it” or something similar, but the truth is we don’t. We never get over anything... the experiences we go through shape us and become part of who we are.

Instead of “getting over it”, find a way to live with it. Take some time to analyze what happened, use it as a learning experience, as a window into yourself to better figure out who you are and what you want.

Time and distance will, however, help you heal. Once you’ve healed enough to take another chance, you’ll be better equipped since you will have grown as a person and as a relationship partner!

Good luck on your journey!"

"Im 23 and have a 5 year younger bro. Last friday I gave him and his friends a ride to the party and without even realizing it started doing this whole “you guys should stop with fucking parties and start doing something useful so you can earn some fucking money.” routine on them.

On the way back I realized what I did and remembered how my dad did the exact same thing to me everytime he gave me a ride somewhere."
I think his explanation was “I’m already ugly so might as well”

"Right? I tried, too. But I'm not spending my very limited time listening to a 15 minute intro about how they have ""sooooo many exciting news this week"" that turn out to be mostly sponsored products or something. Felt just like watching TV, which I don't enjoy at all."
"DCEU would have worked better if they didn’t try to be dark, and if they introduced the characters in a less forced manner.

MCU worked because each movie hinted and suggested that we’d see this or that new character. So when said film came out, it wasn’t rushed and it felt more natural. Plus the writing was better and the directions were better."

"Huh... mine refused all electronics, as we didn't deal with them and 90% of the time, it got smashed anyway. And the plant I worked at managed common bins that people would put out in the street. 

I don't think we served places that recycled electronics. But that is interesting considering the timing. As my stepfather threw his out on the curb. 

The issue with CRT TVs is that due to LED TVs being so common, people don't want CRTs, and this leads to frustration when people try to hand them down. (My grandmother even tried to give one to the Salvation Army and Goodwill, and both refused to even touch it and asked her to take it back.) So it may lead to this illusion that it's only trash now and it ends up in a landfill. "

and a lot of obects that are very marginal.  honestly, if it's something we can comfortably lift and throw, we can throw it with reasonable accuracy over shorter distances. if it's aerodynamically ideal we can throw it a LONG fuckin' way.  i think the Aerobee world record is what like a fucking mile? the javelin world record is 343 feet ffs.  the shot put record is 75 feet which sounds short but it's with a 15 pound sphere.

Her reaction was all ""ohhhh isn't it romantic....!?""

I was, on the other hand, utterly revolted. Literally every relationship in that movie ends because one or both partners end up cheating. Every. Single. One. Nobody broke up, nobody handled things responsibly or maturely, everyone stepped all over everyone elses feelings."

"humans from the perspective of animals is how I imagine lovecraftian horrors. Incomprehensible motives, an animal has no idea what kinda of human they might encounter. Like feeding wildlife, most days obtaining food is difficult, from day to day you obtain just about enough. Then some days this creature offers you a bounty of food for no reason, the next day their uncoordinated screaming offspring chase you, the day after that you watch the creature melded with a euclidean horror crush your mate or watch them inexplicably explode when a creature is near by melded with the enviroment, the end of their appendage a smooth black object."

"A friend of my girlfriends has been going through this, and it's made me think the absolute worst of her. 


She was in a 7-month relationship with her SO and didn't like the way he was living his life. He was unemployed, and while he was looking for a job he isn't a career-oriented sort of person so it wasn't a mad scramble or anything. She didn't like that, as she is a career-oriented 'go-getter'. So she decided to end things with him. Fair enough, that's a good enough reason. 

However she ended it with him under the assumption he would come crawling back to her and change all of the things she didn't like about himself. 

He did not do this. He took the breakup *very* well, moved on, and never spoke to her. 


This was like three months ago and she is still pining after him. Every day my girlfriend gets these long-winded messages about how he hurt her and how 'damaged' she is and how it was his 'job' to get it together and 'fight for her'. She's been told off by multiple people at this point to get over herself and move on with her life but she's still at it. 

It's made me entirely despise her (girlfriends friend) as a person and I haven't even met her. Like how shallow and outright *stupid* do you have to be to pull that kind of shit? She got what she entirely deserved and yet she thinks *she's* the one in the right.

"That's the key.. they don't ask you to ask, they hint around that they want you to ask, so they don't have to suffer the anxiety of possible rejection.

Then, if you're interested, you can be confident that you probably won't be rejected, and you ask.

Or, if you're not, you act like you're not getting the hint, so you won't have to deal with the anxiety of rejecting them.

But sometimes, you don't pick up the hints, so you don't quite no how to play it, and they assume you're doing the 2nd response... and then they get pissed at what they assume is you rejecting them by not taking their hints.

Or sometimes, you think they're hinting, but they're not, and that's how you get the creepers who ""aren't taking the hint"" that she's not interested.

You see, here in America, blunt truth is the only socially unacceptable dynamic."

"The only people that text you after 3 days are the people who really care about you. In my experience with these people, they're forgetful. Anyone who forgets to respond to a text and thinks about me enough to text me 3 days later is a person that cares. They wanted to talk to me and they forgot we were already talking. Now, that's not an exclusive trait for caring about a person, but when people don't care about you they just don't respond ever. 

Obviously it's different for romantic interest. "
