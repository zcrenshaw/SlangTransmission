"Thanks - everyone has been so nice here lol.  Yeah the DA is pressing charges.  Glad I knew what to do, I was def in a better position than most and am able to forsee the after-effects."
"We went back ""home"" for the holidays to visit family and friends when I was younger (20's) and one night we went out and got pretty lit. A couple  members of the group had strayed off but it's normal. So we are at my friend's apartment later that night and get a call from one of the friends ""leo"" saying he needs to come over and talk. My friend ""Jackie"" thinks he is just trying to come up with an excuse to stop by and get a potential booty call so she keeps laughing him off and tells him he's being silly and to call tmro. Come to find out he had murdered one of the group members out in my friends parking lot and that is why he wanted to come over and talk. Not sure exactly what happened but there were def drugs involved and he ended up strangling her!! When the news broke we all said there was no way he did it. Even though our hometown has many ethnicities due to one of the corporate HQ employees many people from other countries, there is not many black people and we thought it was a situation where racism was playing a part. This guy was ALWAYS a good happy guy, always had a smile on his face, never degrading to women etc. I just couldn't picture it. Then he confessed!!! 
Oh and a guy I went to school with (and an ""ex"" of my good friend) murdered his uncle right after high school. Apparently the guy had been abusing my classmate for years and classmate snapped. Tortured him then killed him. By torture I mean made the guy eat a rat at gun point. Guy just getting out of prison now 25 years later. "
