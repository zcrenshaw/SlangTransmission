"I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I think that's kinda young to become sexually active. Have you ever stopped to wonder *why* your parents wouldn't be proud of this?"

"Guns dont kill people, stupid people kill people.
Spoons dont make people fat, cars dont run people over, babies dont want to be aborted, nobody cares what ur sexuality is, trump is not Hitler, safe spaces dont help people, gun free zones are actually invitations for shootings, criminals wont follow a law just because it's a law, your skin complexion doesnt matter, nobody owes you anything, all life is precious, even lives that still happen to be attached to an umbilical cord, except terrorists, rapists, and murderers, they dont matter. You can discuss politics without calling each other a deplorable nazi or a snowflake millenial. Moms and dads are important for a solid family foundation. Being offended happens, reacting like a fool is not. 
Oh and being left handed is actually a sign you are a superior human being."
Also.....papa John is Trump loving dickhole.

Fast food from places like BK slowly kills hundreds of thousands of people.  Fast food will eventually be subject to government and private lawsuits to the point where it's shunned sort of like the tobacco industry.

"Neat.  I've worked food industry in both the UK and US, and one thing that the Polish and Irish people I worked with in the UK always said, was that US food was the highest quality food they worked with, consistently.

I'd give a shit about your opinion of food, if British culture and palette had managed to develop anything more interesting than the pasty, the tart, or fish n chips.

The best part, is how shitty British beer is.  Like, laughably bad."

"You're looking at this from the wrong angle. I'm not saying that they're lying or whatever about having that type of cancer, because it so rare. I'm saying that it isn't as rare as they're saying.

Another thing to say is that lottery is simple mathematical probability and cancer is a very complicated biological process. One can be calculated and predicated precisely, the other is mostly just observed. That couple winning twice is unlikely, and we know that from calculating probability. Fanist getting that type of cancer is unlikely, and we know that from the small amout of people that were confirmed to have it.  
So even the rarest possible cancer, the one that only a single human ever had, isn't as unlikely as one in a trillion(going by the usual definition of human)."
"Yeah, well

I once held 72 grapes in my mouth and took them out one by one intact. I look at grapes now and can’t believe I did that. When I tell the story, I always make it 42, because 72 sounds so stupidly unbelievable. But it was 72.

"Growing up I didn’t notice a thing. To me they seemed just like normal loving parents. In fact, I even considered them intelligent and accomplished. They both had college degrees, both worked full time jobs. Both were rational reasonable people. As an adult I started seeing the signs of their “disability”. It started with their viewpoints and limited perspectives and interpretations of what was happening. They just didn’t understand certain things. I originally attributed it to age or generational differences. I still didn’t think either of them were disabled. Then they did something the immediately put all the pieces together and confirmed my worst suspicions. They voted for trump. Went completely against everything they taught me and who they raised me to be. "
By it getting women things and money. 
"I will give you my reasons I sometimes go to Applebee's. It's cheap, nearby, and I have nice memories of eating there or in similar places with loved ones. 

To eat somewhere the food is guarunteed not microwaved, I either have to pay more, or give up table service, and the latter means going for fast casual or traveling into the city from my suburb.

The exception would be independent diners, but the food served by the ones that are as cheap as Applebee's is of equal or worse quality. Applebee's is at least consistent."
"Seems like you haven't the first idea why people voted Brexit to begin with. You're probably siding with the French elites over the French people too, with that specious attitude. 

To answer your question, you might have been wise to ask that question to the very 'countrymen' who were happy to see their own countrymen's quality of lives deteriorate for decades before the Brexit vote. It would have actually been applicable then."
"Because it's just fearmongering, we were supposed to run out of fossil fuels years ago. Same for ice caps, we should be underwater now. Not to mention how ""global warming"" suddenly became ""climate change"". People just seem to be desperate to have some ""impending doom"" looming over them."
Of debate fascism.
"I really get that and I don't know if I would be strong enough to fight if I would be the one who is in pain or without any hope of getting better.

I just want people to know that they are not a burden. 
Your friends and family love you and want to fight probably more then you.

And even if you think you're all alone in the world there are still people who care.

I worked in a hospital and retirement home.
The people I met there changed my life for the better and I genuinely cared about all of them. 
I might not be able to help any of them and I probably said some klischee and stupid stuff more then once.
But they made an impact on someone's life and there are always people left who care.

"Work at Wendy's, the dam value menu...

When people mix and match Value items with combos and adding more value items to the mix Two combos, 3wraps (2grilled, 1spicy) , 3 JBC's and maybe a potato for good measure during red-zonethen it holds up the drive-thru while I try to get through the order. Or when some orders 10+ JBC's or wraps, then a list of orders pile up

that's the best time to get it as it's usually fresh and we cycle through it quickly, during our later hours/slower hours, 10-12 or in the summer (10-2) the newer grill closers don't cycle their meat/chicken products leaving cold dried meat/chicken to work with. Often it's me waiting on them for them to cook fresh product or get yelled at by my sm or gm because the car been there for 200+seconds

"Booster Juice - Un-BEET-able smoothie

We don't carry straight up beet juice so we have to bring out the juicer and specifically juice beets JUST FOR YOU. On top of the fact that beet juice is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of your skin after washing the blender and you don't know how many people ask us to wash out hands before we make their smoothie because out hands are purple/red."
"Their money that they got from customers who gave them said money in exchange for chicken.

They donated heavily to Focus on the Family which was A) not a charity and B) highly involved in lobbying against gay rights and promoting all sorts of other backwards-ass fundamentalist Christian shit.

From wikipedia:

&gt;Focus on the Family's stated mission is ""nurturing and defending the God-ordained institution of the family and promoting biblical truths worldwide"".[4] It promotes abstinence-only sexual education; creationism;[5] adoption by married, opposite-sex parents;[6] school prayer; and traditional gender roles. It opposes abortion; divorce; gambling; LGBT rights, particularly LGBT adoption and same-sex marriage;[7] pornography; pre-marital sex; and substance abuse. Psychologists, psychiatrists, and social scientists have criticized Focus on the Family for trying to misrepresent their research to bolster FOTF's fundamentalist political agenda and ideology. "

"If they die when you die then their lives still have an impact on the world, so you have an influence on the world through them. The post said that all your influence on the world disappears. That means that it would have to become as if they never existed in the first place. In other words they won’t suffer and they won’t fear their deaths and nobody would miss them, so there’s no harm to them either.

If they’re going to die because of my decision then I’d choose no to the post.
