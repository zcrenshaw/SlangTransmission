"My ex and I had a weird little competition that endured 6 long years.

Whenever we showered together we'd try to sneakily start peeing on the other one w/o them noticing. Bonus points for finishing completely, or gettin 'em while facing eachother. :)

 I could only really get him while he was shampooing  but his parts gave him an unfair advantage.. so he def won."
This one is kinda weird because I feel like we all would have a different definition for what visualizing really is and as far as I know some are way better at it than others. There’s def a difference between somebody who’s bad at it and who can’t do it at all though. Do you think with abstract ideas or with a voice? I know there are successful artists with aphantasia but do you have difficulty drawing from memory?
Same. 36. Even went a month without jerking off once just cause I guess. Def woke up sporting wood every day but never to this day had a wet dream.
"Those are really good thoughts/questions! I've asked a lot of people about visualizing since I found out, and I definitely realized what a spectrum it is. I seem to be at a higher end of visualization than some other people with aphantasia, and I've talked with people who can create high-def movies in their heads and others that can just visualize still pictures of things they've seen before.

I mostly think in sentences, and I can kind of visualize the literal words themselves as I'm thinking. This turns out to make things like debating in person hard, but writing papers really easy. I used to draw a lot of cartoons, but I can't really draw realistic things well, and I have trouble figuring out what colors would look good together. I do get songs/sounds stuck in my head. 

I've practiced trying to visualize over the last couple years, and I think I've achieved MS Paint level of visualization skill. It's slow, it's painstaking, and looks like shit. But hey, it's something! "
