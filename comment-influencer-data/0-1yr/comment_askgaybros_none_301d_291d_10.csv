"Thank you, your story made me cum."
"""Hey, man! It's only gay if you're the bottom!"""
Just ask him how he knows. Had he tried dick?
"STR8 4 STR8 MASC 4 MASC NO FEMS NO FATS.

Grindr in a nutshell, no wonder so many guys on there look fit, the amount of mental gymnastics they must need to do to convince themselves of their 'heterosexuality'."
Dudes out there love thinking they're turning a curious straight guy. It's a total lie but it gets people laid. I can't be mad. 
"Let me try and channel the typical response to this sort of thing... Sexuality is pretty fluid, and it's like this wide spectrum, so I don't see why a straight guy couldn't get past the fact that the person he is with has a cock and balls instead of a vagina. Attraction is so much more than genitals! It can be about the vibes your partner is giving off, or similar interests, like comics or gaming. You can be totally straight and maintain a full erection with a dude simply by thinking about your mutual love of Marvel action movies. Trust me, I'm a Millennial, I know how sex works. /s"
"My boyfriend and I (was 17 now 20) liked to fuck in the woods bc we had nowhere else to hang out. We had found this spot off the road waaaay out in the sticks and had been getting it on there regularly for the whole summer. One bright, sunny September day he was eating my ass in the open air when my high school cross country coach walked up on us. Turns out, this random patch of trees in the middle of bumfuck nowhere was his property and he could see our car and stuff from his window through the trees.

I scrambled under a blanket, but alas I was recognized, though neither of us acknowledged it. For the rest of my senior year we couldn‚Äôt make eye contact. It was really, really bad.




And I didn‚Äôt even get to get off...."
I‚Äôm going to need regular updates on this because I am genuinely invested in this story. I need to know if he‚Äôs wearing a wig or not üëÄ
"When I was growing up and living with my parents, my mom found my Fleshlight in my closet.  She told me it was disgusting and started to hit me with it as I laughed and told her I have needs. "
"I was going to shower and figured I'd jerk off before I showered. As I was looking through gay porn, my dad started to call. He said he needed to talk to my mom really fast. So I put my pants up and handed her the phone.

Completely forgetting what I had just left on my screen, my mom hung up on my dad and the first thing that pops up is two guys fucking.

Try explaining that one when you're not out to your parents yet. "
"I‚Äôve been told that I give better head than any of their hetero counterparts. As far as their sexuality goes, coming out can be a lifelong process. Ha"
"My friend was perplexed when he heard me joking about how much I like to suck dick:

‚ÄúWait?! You‚Äôre a top right? Then how come you suck dicks?... like... I thought tops only get their dicks sucked...‚Äù

Yes Nikita, cause being a top means being a selfish lover..."
?¬ø?¬ø?¬ø?¬ø?????? What is this hetero nonsense 
"as a pervy teen, jerking off while spying on my DILF neighbor mowing his lawn without a shirt on."
"""If you are not careful, YOU TOO can catch the gay."""
Yes. I think the ability to set boundaries for yourself is a function of maturity. 
"The rose pedals didn't come from his wig, but from your hearts. "
"‚ÄúYour mom loved getting pounded by your dad‚Äôs dick, maybe ask her‚Äù"
"The amount of people who won‚Äôt admit that they‚Äôre bisexual is kind of upsetting.


No wonder actual straight people don‚Äôt believe bisexuals exist. 

I‚Äôm gay though, so what do I know."
"Met a cousin of mine who I had never seen (aside from a decade old picture) when I was probably 15 or so. He was drop dead gorgeous straight guy and I was a horny, socially awkward teenager. When he was out, I snuck into his room and smelled his dirty underwear and jerked off in his bed.

I'm now 24 and I find such shame in it, especially because I see him frequently now and he has no idea."
"Your problem isn't being a masc bottom. I'm on the masc side and I have no issue getting fucked. Your problem is you're a big guy and you're only 19. There are huge muscle tops that would be more than willing to powerfuck you.

But you're 19, really new to gay adult life, and probably havent made the connections to the people you really want to fuck. Don't worry, it'll come."
In moderation no. Just don't go overboard and bring it up all the time. 
It's the stories that keep me coming back.
Stacey‚Äôs dad‚Äôs got it going on as well apparently 
"I was having sex with a minor league baseball player I met at a bar (he took me back to his hotel). I was being so loud that our hotel-neighbors knocked on our door and Baseball guy gave them two $100 bills to leave us alone (presumably to buy a room far away from us).



But that isn't the most embarrassing part of this story. The guy that knocked on our door was with his wife and they were convinced I was underage (I look younger for my age). So after they took Baseball guy's money the manager was knocking on our door, demanding to see my ID or face the police.

So there I am, in nothing but my underwear, a robe, and an expression of shameful embarrassment.

I was 23 at the time so it was chill, just incredibly embarrassing."
Next time tell him: for the same reasons your mama does! ;)
"The first boyfriend I ever had was always fine with his religion and with his sexuality, and I didn‚Äôt mind. Until he went to a Christian camp over the summer (we were in high school) and said he devoted his life to serving God and he couldn‚Äôt do it being gay, so he had to become straight.

Ever since then I have scrambled to get away from any religious guys."
i'm a top on grindr bc i got a hemorrhoid last month
That sounds like the same people who think being a bottom is more gay than being a top. Either way you're having intercourse with a man...
It's only gay if you take off your socks
If it was a porno that would have gone in a very different direction
"I mean... that‚Äôs a good thing, no? "
Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. Being gay is way harder than anyone will tell you and finding meaningful relationships don‚Äôt come as easily to us as it does to straight people. Focus on you and not so much on finding a partner. Remember there is nothing wrong with who you are.
You and your ex are horrible people
"When I was a horny teenager living at home, I would frequently go on Craigslist to try and hook up with guys. I once managed to set something up with a guy in my home town but since I was living with my dad, I had to have the guy meet me in the alley by my house. I was hidden behind the trash bin blowing this guy at around midnight when some guy walked into the alley and saw us. We took off running. I‚Äôm like 90% sure it was my dad that caught us.

(I didn‚Äôt let that stop me though. We drove off somewhere and I blew him in a field.) 

Edit: I feel like my dad saw me sneak out and that‚Äôs how he saw me/was in the alley. "
"I understand the frustration, but some men have always identified as straight and later in life start to question their sexuality. 

They might explore their sexuality online, where it‚Äôs easier to remain anonymous, so it‚Äôs a safer environment to experiment in. 

While it‚Äôs not the kind of people I look for for a hook-up or romantic date, I do respect them.

And I think that as a community, we should always respect that everyone has their own story.  Many of us have struggled a lot with being different, so let‚Äôs not give our brothers in the community a hard time for being different either."
"Him:  ""How can you like dick? Pussy is wayyy better dude."" 

You: ""So you're admitting you've tried dick?  How else could you compare the two?""

Him: ""...""

Me: \*rolls on floor laughing\*"
Just tell them what you really like about dick. Go into far too much detail and really awkward up the convo. That‚Äôs been a tactic of the LGBT community for decades.
"If a guy is really cute or good but I don't think he's gonna be looking to hook up more than once, I'll try to kick his belt under my bed so he'll forget it. Then I can use ""hey you forgot your belt"" as a way to try to get him to come back over. Sometimes I get laid again, sometimes I just get a free belt. Win-win"
"""Haha mom chill gay porn is just a joke between me and my friends"" Seems convincing enough "
"Rejection hurts every single time, but nice job telling him how you feel. That can be scary and takes courage and you should pat yourself on the back for doing that."
Watch him have normal hair but he‚Äôs actually just into drag
He‚Äôs drunk and horny and you‚Äôre gay (read. good at sucking dick).  That‚Äôs all there is to it.  He‚Äôs not ‚Äúgoing through anything‚Äù.
"Body: complete
Rhythm: ?
Routine/Schtick: ?
Personality/Dealing with People: ?

You may also want to check with some call out services. My friends got me two for my 40th Birthday. Might do that first and then the clubs?

Also, you just want to dance? How about getting your Bartending license? 
"
"Its this.  These guys know they pass for straight and get away with it.   I would know, I am one of them."
Befriend ugly guys. 
"I'm a  5'5"" twink who hates being thrown around and prefers to top. I have been throwing myself at the gym all year to try and at least look a little bit more ""toppy"" I guess.

The struggle is real man."
"Super religious guys are a red flag to me. I totally believe in being a good person, but organized religion is not for me. I've seen some of the smartest guys I know say the most (what I would think of) ridiculous things. I don't think that there's any bad intention behind it, or that people shouldn't practice their chosen religion, but it's not for me because I don't think it's ever something I could fully believe in and get behind."
"in vino veritas, dude - in that moment, he truly wanted it, no doubt in my mind - he wasn't fucking with you, he *wanted to fuck you*.

... that said, if he chooses, while sober, to live his life in a such a way that *doesn't* involve fucking you, that is absolutely his decision and you need to respect that.

but he definitely wanted it in the moment. And he's 19, so chances are he's not mature enough to own up to it - I know 39-year-olds that aren't mature enough to do that.

You don't know him that well - you've only met in person once. It's pretty soon for you guys to have to deal with something like this, like it's a real big roadblock for your friendship. If it were me, I'd try to meet up with him - trying to pretend nothing happened is ridiculous, I don't do that shit - but I would be honest, say ""hey, you were drunk, it's cool, people make fools of themselves when they're drunk, that's what you did, and I won't hold it against you - we can still be friends."" At least that way you've done your due diligence - the rest is up to him, whether he can manage to recover from this little slip-up.

also. I wouldn't necessarily hold my breath, but... it'll probably happen again."
"I let someone, who claimed to love me, leave scars on my body in the name of play. He ended up abusing me( physically and emotionally) soon after. I hate having my shirt off since you can see them and theyre pretty obvious( theres a tic tac toe board on my back). Now its like he permanently owns me and i hate it."
"""You noticed a wig cleaner""

These are not Nancy Drew skills, honey. "
"She screamed and was like, wtf was that!? And I snatched the phone and goofed around saying I have a friend who snapchats me gross stuff to be funny.

I don't think she bought it, but obviously didn't ask further questions "
"How about ""if it's about the wig I literally don't care""

How about you just use words to communicate "
I hooked up with a Scientologist. I‚Äôm just glad I didn‚Äôt stick around 
and that's why you don't have people go to your hotel room. this is why the lobby exists. 
I want to be loved.
"Years ago I hooked up with a really hot guy I met online: bearded, rugged looks, tattoos... 
It was winter and cranked up the heating in my car to get in the mood. We fucked hard in my car for a long time and ended up super sweaty: his smell was dreadful, he most probably didn‚Äôt shower before the date.
The stench was so strong I had to drive in the highway for hours with all the windows down. That didn‚Äôt work. Next day my mom borrowed the car and asked me why it was smelling so fucking awful. I don‚Äôt remember the excuse as it was a bad one but I remember the shame."
I'll cum on your back.
"It sucks this happened to you. I'm sorry that some people are such assholes.

It was probably scary going to the police, but you did the right thing. Even if nothing comes of it you tried. 
"
"Yes. Except for the ""in front of my salad"" girl. She's cool. 
...autocorrect"
"Lol. I love the people who are like ""I don't like labeling my sexuality.""

Labels keep people in Florida from drinking Windex. 

Not everything needs a label IMO (like I can't say whether I'm masc or fem because I'm smack dab in the middle basically), but sexuality is kind of a big thing. 

If you're attracted to guys and girls, just say that you're bi. It's not hard. "
"I was called a fag once by a top on Grindr. I sent a pic of my ass and he said ""Disgusting. I bet you're a fucking bottom, fag."" So either he was trolling, or an idiot. 1. I'm vers. 2. If it weren't for bottoms, you'd all be jerking off into socks. "
"same, i wanna be there for when it gets snatched"
"üòÇüòÇüòÇ omg

TS ONLY THAT LOOK LIKE GIRLS AND DONT LET ME SEE THEIR PENIS WHEN WE HAVE SEX ONLY "
wat
Sigh. **unzips**
"The amount of ""omg did I get HIV"" posts are TOO DAMN HIGH!"
"I have a double closet in my bedroom. One time while my husband and I were going at it, I looked over and saw that our dog had realized that she could walk in one door, walk out the other, and still be in the bedroom! She did this no less than 10 times before I finally told my husband we needed to change positions and face away from the closet. It's hard to be sexy when your idiot dog has made the discovery of her lifetime."
"When you grew up in &amp; around a bad environment that tried its hardest to tell you you were evil and worthless but you persevered - yes

When you receive tearful anonymous calls from young guys locally who see your very existence as mature, professional, married gay guys as the only evidence of a possible positive outcome for themselves - yes

When you have kids who are now teens and realize through conversations that an entire generation of local kids have seen your family as a living example of what being gay citizens can mean when it could have easily been horrible and stereotypical - yes

&amp;#x200B;

If your answer to this is that you don't really care, that it means nothing, please realize that it is all relative to your experience and locale.  Yes, there is a whole lot more to life - it sometimes surprises me when I'm reminded that I am gay because I have so many other things that also define me - but the same is true of any aspect that you love about yourself because it makes you you.   ""I'm gay/a sci-fi nerd/a parent/a hiking buff, and that's fucking awesome!"""
"There are two options to deal with that.  First, get a tat to cover it and retake your body; second, if you have a gay community center give them a call and ask if there is someone there or if they can refer you to someone who has experience with domestic abuse.  When you speak to the person tell them about your back and how you'd really like to get it covered or removed.  There are people out there who are willing to help domestic abuse victims to address scars that were the result of abuse. "
This is beautiful.
"That I like fat men. I even told my mother I'm into mature men but I can't bring myself to add the ""fat"" part to it. That and the fact I kinda want a 24/7 Master/slave relationship.

I also have super fucked up fantasies about movie characters (cartoon and video game characters as well, when I was younger)

As for actual experiences, I met with a creepy old dude a few years ago. He was fat, ugly, and out to everyone. As he led me to his house, everyone in those narrow streets must have realised what we were gonna do, and you can imagine how embarrassed I was to be seen with him. But I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy every second of being treated like his little bitch."
"1) Stick some music in your ears
2) Stop looking at what everyone else is doing
3) Give yourself a pat on the back for being there"
You didn‚Äôt know how old he is? You don‚Äôt know where he came from? Wig? Secrets? He might be a spy. 
"As a bisexual cam performer, I get a huge amount of private messages from straight guys that are curious or have secret fantasies, but can't talk to anyone about it in their world.  It bothers me that they don't have anyone they trust, but I'm happy I can at least let them explore.  Hopefully it lets them begin to sort out their feelings.

btw, it often feels like bisexuals are seen as people that haven't picked a team yet.  I've felt it sometimes while talking with groups of straight friends (not as much credit as if I'd have come out as gay) or gay friends (you're only partially on our team so not a target of the hate out there).  It mostly makes me sad, but I realize it is just a phase we'll get through at some point."
Break up with your jackass boyfriend and go get this wonderful man

"I can tell you what stripping was like at my club, but I live in Portland.

They had an amateur night on Wednesdays, where you can dance on stage but not give private dances. At the end of the night, the manager could decide to invite me back for another amateur night or tell me to just enjoy the bar as a patron. I have a gymnastics and dance background, so I was hired on the spot. It's not particularly difficult to get hired, there's a lot of turnover.

I don't think you need to change anything about your physique before you start dancing. TBH I always lost weight when I was working a lot, even after demolishing a massive burrito at 2:30 after a shift. Most guys do not look as good as you do when they get hired. 

Dancing is not that hard, you don't even have to really have rhythm or anything. Gyrate, show off as much as you legally can, learn how to twerk from another dancer, do any athletic tricks you have up your sleeve. If you can't dance, it's all about showing your strength and athleticism in an erotic, sensual way. If you're not getting a lot of people to tip you, just have fun dancing goofily to the music. If you can find a hip-hop dance studio that does drop-ins, that's a great way to build a repertoire of moves. 

What's much harder (imo) is talking to people. I never got great at it. I did the best when guys broke the ice and talked to me first (generally soon after my set on stage), so I tried to be very flashy with my moves when I could to get attention. When I initiated conversations, I tried to keep the conversation rolling about my body/sexuality because that's your product. I tried to keep up this ""eternal party"" kind of fun. Nothing is every serious in the club.

Don't wear a jockstrap on the floor unless you want someone to try and casually finger you. I always wore athletic shorts with a jockstrap (the kind where you could still see the outline of the jockstrap).

This job can take a serious toll on your mental health. Staying at a club night after night until closing puts you in a crazy sleep schedule. I noticed you're already a little unrealistic about your body, and stripping may exacerbate that. This job is not worth it if it's going to leave you with mountains of insecurities (and there will be nights where you absolutely do not make money, no matter how hot you are).

This is not a career, it is a side hustle. Girls make 2-10x more what we do, almost no male stripper is saving for their retirement while working. You can make a good amount of money as an escort as well, it's a fairly common combination (the stripping kind of becomes advertising for other services). In any case, the first thing you need to plan is your way out. How long do you think you'll need this? Are you planning on continuing education? Have you ever thought about personal training (easy to get a great certification)? Becoming a masseur? Dietician? Yogi? Physical therapist? There are a lot of actual careers that you could easily work on while you're making money at the club that already likely align with your interests.

All that said, this is a fun job. I noticed you're feeling apart from the LGBT community--this is one of the best ways to feel like an insider into it. I met incredibly interesting people that I never would have met otherwise."
"This should be higher up. If OP's paraphrase is accurate, the questioner is either a willing experimenter or, more likely, talking out his ass."
Hi its me your ugly friend

"I am a top, but I LOVE having the bottom sit on my face and just covering me in ass.  I could eat ass for hours.  I feel like I need to stop while I am ahead before something happens...... "
use your mouth to make sounds at him
This should be a popular opinion. 
"Not to be crass but the fact that he‚Äôs 19 will just add to the reasons why tops would love him lol

"
"Bareback bottoming. I'm the top in my relationship now but before, if I knew the guy was clean (to the best of my knowledge) And he wanted to cum inside, man nothing felt better. Feeling those contractions and then the semen coming out and spraying, and then dripping out later. Miss it sometimes not going to lie

But specifically the secret is telling my mother that my friend from school was over (it was my bf at the time) while she went to a play and then let him fuck me several times over without a condom. Not my finest moment

There was the time that I sucked a guy off and swallowed in a commuter lot

There was the time I let myself get barebacked after a funeral 

There was the time I got barebacked in an abandoned hotel 

There was the time I sucked a guy off butt naked in a bathroom

Also there's the time i let an older man I barely knew strip me naked, spank me, and have me sit on top of his hard cock while he masturbated. So hot but another one of my not so fine moments.

Finally there's the time I went on a hike with a guy but I had picked him up and on the hike he got all sweaty we started fooling around anyways and I ended up eating sweaty ass, licking sweaty balls and sucking sweaty dick. And for some reason I do not regret this at all"
"No. You don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the last thing you need.

You need to find yourself, first."
"True. I have also thought about that. But I was scared I might throw him off guard with my Nancy Drew skills.

But you may be right. Being straightforward about it makes it easy and potentially sweet."
Isn't that why they make double headed dildos?
I was supposed to meet this guy's dad but these two idiots scared him off.
It‚Äôs not exploiting if you like sucking dick anyway 
"Just like any stupid question throw it back at them ""why do you like pussy? Dick is waaayyyyy better dude"" and see the shock on their face. "
"""See that wall?"" said the bitter Scotsman at the pub... 

I built that wall, all the way from here to Glenmore, but do they call me ""Angus the wall-builder? Nooo!""

""And see the church spire? Built that too. Do they call me ""Angus the steeple-builder""? Noo!""

""And that terrible night when the orphanage burned down,I saved all the wee bairns from the flames: ""Angus the orphan-saver""? Noo!""

""But..."" He paused to sip his beer... ""You fuck just *one dude*..."""
Wigtoria secrets.
I can‚Äôt believe I have to give you an upvote cause you made me chuckle üòí
I fucked my ex boyfriend at his wedding.
"I have a fuckbuddy that is into publishing videos and stuff of himself on tumblr/twitter. He made me an account and we started uploading stuff from me or between us, as long as I didnt show my face and stuff like that.

Fast forward three weeks and im getting REALLY damn popular on the ""twitter porn"" accounts of my country. No biggie I guess, I dont think people recognize me.

Wasnt that lucky, It seems some photos and videos show parts of my house that a close friend of mine recognized because he likes to jack off to those type of twitter accounts...On a party he tells me I need to be more discrete because he recognized my house and body almost inmediatly and it seems in some videos parts of my face show :) soooooo I got really ashamed and stop posting stuff there. I know it turns me on and my fuckbuddy but now I live on panic that more friends recognized me.

Also some people on grindr have told me they love my twitter account even tho i dont have it linked anywehere. Seems my body is kinda easy to recognize or something and im panicking xD"
"I'm 6'6 and I try to present myself as ""powerful, regal, confident, dominant"" given I'm built, and I've topped twice...

But I'd like to bottom for once and I don't think I get much success advertising that. The real secret is that I used a Checkers soda cup as a makeshift fleshlight once. "
"*It's a lot easier to build a house out of wood than stone, but also a lot easier for said house to burn down as well.*"
5 more years and maybe you will give him a handjob.
It would affect you no more than being adopted by a straight couple would. Just be you üôÇ
Middle school can be a confusing time
thats my worst fear actually
"That's the big thing really. Nearly no one cares about people smoking pot, bit most people dislike the 420 culture, just like most people don't care about people drinking but look down on adults obsessed with club scene. 

Also, don't drive high."
Making your entire identity about smoking weed is trashy. Disrespecting others around you when smoking weed is trashy. People who smoke weed at the expense of other hobbies or bettering themselves are what I think about when I think of trashy weed smokers.
"Totes. This happens. Last saturday I got drunk with some dudes and when they found out I was gay they started asking a lot of kinky sex related questions, including whether I found them attractive. I thought nothing of it. It was fun."
"&gt; hit me with it

...aaand a new fetish was born."
"There are an oddly large amout of adopted kids at my school (like 6) who have gay parents and none of them are gay, I wouldnt worry about it."
"red flag, red flag, red flag.  this is not normal "
I was on the yearbook staff at my small private school. I had to spend a lot of time in the computer lab laying out pages and editing pictures. One time I was there in the building alone and I got horny and went to some gay porn sites and jacked off. I didn‚Äôt think anything else about it until a few days later I got questioned by an IT person because my computer had a gay porn virus infecting it causing gay porn pop up ads (I wish I knew which of my Christian private school class mates got exposed to gay porn that day). I told them I had no idea how the virus got on my computer and that I only used the internet to get fonts and such. It was a shared computer so they had no way to prove it was me. lol
Well... you could *snatch his wig* but that's just a suggestion  üòâ

"I don't really lose the sexual attraction, I still think he is as hot as before, but I do lose interest."
"If you can cum like that you probs have a quick recovery too.

Also that's like so flattering to the other guy tbh üòÖ"
"Personally, I don‚Äôt mind people that do it as long as they don‚Äôt go out of their way to make sure you KNOW they smoke weed. Aside from that, the smell of it makes me sick so I would never do it myself."
Nobody has ever had a crush on me.
"Gays: Ay you got your dick sucked by a guy you gay af hahahahaha.

Straight: I only like this or that with a guy every once in a while. Otherwise I'm all about the pussy 100% no homo!!

Me: You realize bisexuality is a thing right?... What ever happened to the *SPECTRUM*."
"Not a bit. I have some gay friends and I had a lot of exposure to and make some friendships with some gay guys performing on cam. 

Seeing some of the posts on here helps me relate to them. Plus, i like sex in general and some of this is kinda entertaining tbh. "
"I was 15 and had borrowed my mama's car to go hook up with a friend. As we were both 15 and had no private space, we drove somewhere and did it in the back seat of the car. When my mama went to use the car the next morning, there was a filled condom dangling from the back seat door. Upon confrontation, the best I could reply was ""At least we were playing safe!""
She was still not amused..."
"Thats wild ho shit, but we appreciate your honesty "
"I definitely need to learn all that it actually takes to be a dancer, definitely.  I have a few dancer friends but they're all women.  One I'm closer with said she'd love to go to the big gay club here with me and that she has a few dancer friends there that she'd introduce me to so I need to get on top of making that happen.  

Just as an aside as I didn't mention it, in general my experience with the gay life is rather limited.  I've never really thought about my sexuality; in general, I'm just attracted to people.  But having worked at a gay bar now for a few months, I know that I'm very disconnected from certain parts of the culture.  Though I'm very good with people and socializing with them so I anticipate the most difficult part being the actual dancing part of it.

Anyway thank you very much!"
I mean good for you but it was in the heat of the moment. Have a normal date and talk it out once you're done sucking his dick. 
"Good luck, but even if your family is totally cool with your orientation I would have a serious conversation with them about respecting your privacy. I could understand if you left gay porn up and they saw, but reading ""all of my chats with guys"" is creepy and disrespectful."
\*hugs\*
"Clever try, CIA."
"And like tobacco, be respectful of others around you as well."

"I sort of get this, as I have a large forehead combined with a receding hairline, but good lord, I can't imagine trying to break up with someone because of that. It seems like he has some serious rejection issues that you'll have to slowly coax him into getting over."
"So me and this guy (I was 16 and he was 18 at the time) I was fucking at the time decided to go out to the local park and fuck because neither of us could bring anyone home. There is also a nice park behind my house so it wasn't really a big deal. I laid a blanket down for us to do it in a clearing surrounded by trees in a flattish part of the hill, so I know no one is going to interrupt or see us. 

*I didn't see the poison ivy there.*

Ended up basically rolling around in it and covering the entire top half of my body in poison ivy. Needed to go to the ER and missed a week of school while being stuck in bed covered in bandages. I ofcourse told my mom what happened (sparing the details about the fucking) and she was actually cool about it, but of course called me an idiot and told me to bring the boy home next time.

Got covered in poison ivy, but didn't care because I had sex."
This is the T mawma 
Lol if I had that kink I would have a satisfying sex life lol 
"Yeah I was scared to death and thought I was going to to throw up, but after I told him how I felt and got the solid rejection, I felt a little better even though it was bitter sweet"
It‚Äôs quite awkward. It‚Äôs more awkward when you‚Äôre gay and a girl has a crush on you haha üò≠

"My first week of college, I hooked up with a guy in the showers when they were empty. I was blowing him and he was about to blow when i heard a person walking into the pockets. I was about to get up when he shot a wad of cum right up my nose. Into my damn sinuses. "
Your friends don‚Äôt send you gay porn for fun?
What did she have to say about that?
My first and only hookup happened in my car in a random high school parking lot.... I think I got cum stains on my left rear window that you have to really look for. I've mostly washed it out. My coworkers found out about it and my car is now nicknamed the museum and the seat where it all happened is the nut seat lmao. They fight over who sits in the seat lol 
Super hot
"Meh.

I fucked my cousin was your age, and was well aware we were related.

In hindsight I should be ashamed of it, but we were 14 and stupid kids doing stupid shit. I kinda feel like if that‚Äôs the worst either of us do in life, we‚Äôll be alright.

(We‚Äôve both done worse. Far worse. His stupidity was on national TV, however, so I‚Äôm pretty Golden atm)

Anyways, point is, don‚Äôt feel too guilty about it."
"for some reason this really made me laugh really hard

i keep rereading it and still laugh"
I dont know what a straight space is. If I'm in an area and I see someone tasty that space about to get gay af fam. 
"Kind of feel like he's down to smash but since you rejected all his advancements he's retreating.

"I (str8 male) stripped for several years doing private parties. Never tried the club thing but know guys who did. 

You‚Äôll definitely want to know some dance for a club. I was able to get away without it because I basically didn‚Äôt do any dancing, just swaying and getting felt up a lot. 

Your body looks sick.  Don‚Äôt worry about a couple pounds. You‚Äôre going to fluctuate anyway and if what i learned about what dudes like from when they were at parties i did or from a lot of camming you‚Äôre going to rock it from that standpoint."

Well that doesnt bode well for your application process"
I am but I still crush on them regardless even if they show any kind of sencerity
"Well after first reading the question in the title my first thought was, ""they are magically delicious"". They start out small and soft and get large and rock hard and after a while they shoot out this white cream. That's magic! Then I read the rest of the comment and thought, I wonder if the person asking op the question has tried it? A good reply to that person that said pussy is better, might be, so you've had dick?"
"This guy was giving me head and his mom called, he put his mom on speaker and signal to me to stay quiet and he continued sucking me. His mom kept asking what was that sound (it was sucking sound) and he said idk then his mom said I'll call you back your phone acting weird."
"Dammit you bastard. 

*gets down on knees*"
Am I the only gay man who is shit at giving blow jobs?
[deleted]
I fuck my pillow.
"Oh MAN do I got a story. Freshman year of college my roommate moves out after the first semester, and I never get a new one. Months go by, and no one ever shows up for the second semester. So I start to bring guys over occasionally....and to ready myself I generally use a dildo...a real large 10/11inch one, VERY thick. I kept it out of sight except when I would use it....and of fucking course the day I leave it out on my desk guess who moves in....my new (Extremely Hot) French rugby player roommate. The second he left the room I hid it and we never spoke of it. Nor did I EVER bring any guys over."
I assume he‚Äôs shocked that someone as ugly as me exists 
"As a trans guy, it's nice to have hope that someone could want me some day. Thanks, stranger ;-; "
That's totally normal. Free yourself of your shame! 
Y'all some hoes
"At least you learned quickly that these guys were too immature to form meaningful friendships with. Don't sweat it, who cares what they think. I certainly do lots of ""masculine"" things, and I've had people accuse me of lying about being gay, but in the end of the day, I may educate them a little bit, but mostly just move on. "
Glad you reported it. Hope your dick feels better soon. 
This is hilarious. Good on your coach for keeping quiet. 
That shit is so annoying lmao
As a top knowing someone out there loves that feeling gives me a little chub. *Adjust package to the right*
"See I genuinely just lose everything so this has happened a couple times.

The one time the guy woke his mom up at 4am to drive him to my house because he forgot his phone in my car, so that was pretty funny.

The only guy I‚Äôve hooked up with that didn‚Äôt want a repeat was the straight guy I topped(legit looks exactly like Lip from Shamless, not even kidding) he took it like a trooper but I was inexperienced, overly excited, and his poor booty is still in my prayers."
I don't top very well myself and have only done it successfully a handful of times. I loose my boner and or cum almost immediately when I do get it in. I'd rather bottom 
"When I get stressed out, my sex drive goes through the roof as an avoidance thing. I‚Äôm working on grad school applications and I‚Äôve masturbated to orgasm 4-5 times in the last 36 hours (I lost count). I‚Äôm 26.

Additionally, the loads have not gotten smaller. The fifth was just as big as the first."
"""She has more guts than I ever did!""

Not necessarily: she has grown up in a different era (time period) than you--likely that is the major difference.

Proceed as you wish.

Good luck. :)"
"I used to cam on Chaturbate, wasn't even for money really, just for the kicks of it. Anyway, I hook up with this guy and we get talking on the way to his house, and I tell him I have an account. Said he'd love to fuck me whilst we were live. Horny as fuck, I agreed and once we got there we began. 

I had a fuck ton more viewers than I normally did, probably because the thumbnail showed two guys, and I got a load of comments calling me a slut and the like. I sucked his cock and rode his dick, playing it up for the camera a bit, and it ended with him jizzing all over my face. We stayed online for a while afterwards, just lying naked and talking to the viewers. It was great"
"I was rimming this cute ginger guy and he quietly moans ""You dirty boy"", which I just thought was hilarious. I had to stuff my face in his ass to muffle my laughing.

When we were all done I asked him if he knew he'd said it. He replied ""Yeah, sorry, but I'm catholic, and what we just did is a sin.""

I was like ""Okay, well, byeeee. You can show yourself out.""

5 years later, after I'd moved away, I came back and visited a friend, and he was dating the ginger guy! Apparently he'd made big strides reconciling his religion and sexuality, so good for him, I guess."

"I saw a guy I met in the dorms on grindr during my senior year. I messages him to see how he was, and how I didn‚Äôt know he was into guys. He proceeds to tell me- Oh I‚Äôm not gay, my friends just told me to check out the app.....Sureeee"
It should be. Sometimes it‚Äôs frowned upon though. I guess I just think this way because of the number of gay men who want to be with a straight guy. 
"A couple of weeks ago, an anonymous person on here made a post talking about how he hooked up with a gay senator/politician etc. and was thinking about outing this person because they were helping design anti gay laws

"You can not really control who you crush on, but you can learn how to deal with those feelings. Control them instead of letting them control you.

It is okay to have feelings for the guy, but you shouldn't let them gain the upper hand on your friendship if they are not mutual."
"It happened quite recently when I just discovered the joy of topping my boyfriend (he's vers while I'm ~100% bottom before he really started egging me to try giving presents). It was my second time topping in my whole life: I was balls deep inside him and when I was just about to climax, I blurted out ""oh hold on a second"" and ripped a huge fart.

We were half covered by the duvet so I kind of dutch-opened both of us right before I came. We wouldn't stop laughing after that.

p/s: Oh, and another one: we just finished watching Big Mouth, and when we got hot and frisky in the bed that evening I said [""oh &lt;boyfriend's name&gt; lets rub fronts"" in Lola's voice](https://youtu.be/rMdwMeXUv18?t=66). Both boners were gone for a few minutes while we tried to gather our faculties from laughing too hard."
Does anyone actually believe it's a choice? Lol.
"Nobody likes a reluctant top.

Reluctance in general is not something the vast majority of people want to see in sex, but topping is especially better when done with passion. Pounding a reluctant bottom might appeal to someone *really* into BDSM. But as far as I know there is no fetish for half-assed passionless sex, which is what you get when the top doesn't really wanna top."
I do. Especially if it‚Äôs sex right before going and doing something social with friends/family. It‚Äôs like having a dirty little secret haha. 
Spying and taking pictures of guys in the locker room in high school. Yeah not proud of that one
"After lunch in high school i had history, There was this other gay guy in that class that wasn‚Äôt out yet. I would tell the teacher I had to go to the bathroom. Then he would make an excuse or leave without saying anything, we would meet in the bathroom and we would fuck, these sessions were 40 minutes sometimes. We would do this once or twice a week for an entire school year. The teacher never caught on, he was pretty cool. Completely oblivious to us, we both smelt like Axe and dick, and nobody caught on. We ended up figuring out how to open the locked family restroom with a penny. 

And thats the reason i failed American History, not very proud of myself for choosing dick over education. "
Oh this thread should be good

Michael told him, whilst he was on a gay dating app"
Do you ever as a gay man get drunk and horny and send dick pics to your girl friends? This boy ain't straight dear. 
I agree. It makes you feel sexy. Also white boxers as you can totally see clearly bulges. Lol
"It depends.. for some people religion is just a way to find peace of mind, those people don't hurt others with their religion, they just practise quietly to themselves and live happier as a result of it, without trying to push their beliefs on others, and this applies across all religions.

Then there are people who are.. more zealous, preachy, who try to push their beliefs on others, this obviously is not healthy, but again it's not even just religious people who do it. You get some (not all) vegans, CrossFit people, atheists etc who try really hard to push whatever their thing is onto other people. 

I honestly don't think the religion is the problem, I think it's how people use it that's the problem. The same person who preaches that you're going to hell for eating shellfish or whatever would be equally happy preaching that everyone with religion is an idiot with imaginary friends. It's not the belief itself, it's the person that's broken. 

People like to believe that they're right, and to have an ""other"" to pin all the problems in the world on, and that enables them to weaponise any belief.

So.. I wouldn't see religion as a red flag. I would see _pushing_ your beliefs as a red flag, whatever those beliefs or lack thereof might be."
i'd be careful with this guy. the fact that he kept his age and country of origin a secret are both big red flags. he doesn't sound trustworthy and i'd really consider whether you want to be in a relationship with someone dishonest/secretive. this doesn't sound healthy.
Just say you're not feeling well or  be politely honest. I've told a guy once that 'it just didn't feel right'. He took it pretty good and we even talked for a bit before I left his apartment. 
"I like when guys pre-cum. I think its very flattering, like objective proof that I'm turning them on."
No to my half sister.
I wouldn‚Äôt do anything. Nothing you‚Äôve said is completely concrete examples of same sex attraction. I think this is just a guy who‚Äôs comfortable being around you and you‚Äôre looking for reasons he might be gay. 
Tell them that dicks taste generally better than vaginas(at least in my opinion) and maybe they‚Äôll understand better. 
Why was your dad in an alley at midnight?
A marine sucked my dick on deployment three days after I broke up with my girlfriend. 
I've got a diploma in health sciences and studied child psych: nope. The only effect your 2 dads are having on you is giving you a loving home (I mean i hope it's a loving home). 
You're really really cute. You just look young. I'm sure with the right attitude all the boys will be lusting over you.
"From my experience with gay strippers, i don‚Äôt think you need to be very cultured. Mostly, dudes are gonna find you hot and be willing to give you money in exchange for being hot and for waving your junk in their face to a rhythm. Bonus money for letting them touch you. "
"MEN usually adds a female as part of the ‚Äústory‚Äù and she says like 3 lines and gets out of the picture, I don‚Äôt mind it sometimes I find it hilarious like with the right in front of my salad-girl.

"&gt;It's too late - he's cumming all inside my mouth as I look up and see a delivery guy turning the corner. He turns to look at us the very moment I look up. 

&gt;He can see everything, my friend's huge dick very visible sticking out of his pants, literally cumming on me, while I lock eyes with the delivery guy, mortified.
I swear he looked as if his life had changed, and cycled on ahead, stunned.

This actually made me laugh out loud."
I actually find that less awkward because you can turn them down without having to blame anything about them specifically. 
Get pinned against the wall while the top carries me. 
You look super great! If you aren‚Äôt really someone who goes clubbing are you able to handle the late hours of the job?
"Ah, again with this myth that you have to douche before anal.

Been in 2 relationships for about 15 years total. Can count the number of times my partner or I have douched on one hand. Never had any significant problems."
"The problem with the question is that it presupposes that sexual attraction is the result of some sort of logical thought process. Vagina isn't better than dick or vice versa. We're just attracted to what we're attracted to.

Also, just ask your friend if he'd be attracted to a vagina attached Bradley Cooper's body. He probably wouldn't be. Our attraction to things doesn't exist in a vacuum. Dicks and vaginas are part of larger packages, and it's those packages that turn on us on, not the individual components. Once you remove the components from the packages, our perception of them change."
"Not in his office and only if he was single.

I find the article to be a bit obnoxious though.  This would be shitty behavior even if he was having heterosexual sex in his office.

Dude you screwed up by not visiting him at the hospital when he was willing to make time for you in all other aspects of your encounters. If he‚Äôs still in the hospital go visit him and if not show up to his place with flowers and apologize and tell him the truth. 
It means they accept mastercard.
"I used to do this when the two hot dads moved in next door. I mean, I'd just watch but not jerk off."

"It honestly seems like it will lead to toxic behavior to me, it can easily become emotionally manipulative to always jump to the ""well let's break up because I'm so unlovable and have been my entire life"" card.


That on top of this guy lying about so many minor things. Like would he disclose if he has an STI or is it just unbearably embarrassing for him to do so?


The level of insecurity is ridiculously high, and it's very difficult to have a stable relationship with someone like that.


I wish OP good luck though. "

"Just went through the same thing a couple days ago. It didn‚Äôt hurt much initially, then I slept for 18 hours and spent the rest of the next day extremely depressed. Now, I‚Äôm over it I think, but the big test is in a couple weeks when we likely see each other again and I actually interact with him. The biggest thing is just to not take it personally; If you‚Äôre like me, youu probably can‚Äôt fully explain why he makes you feel the way you do, and he probably can‚Äôt explain why he doesn‚Äôt feel that way towards you. Love is a fickle and picky thing sometimes, and the whole ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt he like me‚Äù thing is one of the hardest thoughts to avoid."
"Im the same way too. Once I know someones straight I lose all interest, and once I become friends with someone I just see them as a brother. But with the amount of ""im in love with my straight friend"" posts on here I feel like im a minority as well lol. "
"It must be when my boyfriend was fucking me missionary style one of the first times I went over to his place. It was the first time he had an apartment on his own and a long term boyfriend, so I guess he felt he could be a little bit wilder than usual, so he was banging me with all the weight of his body and well, he's 190 cm and rather muscular, so right before reaching climax the slats of the bed gave and I hit the floor with him on top.

It is rather funny to think about it now. I stormed out of there with a big bump on my head, pissed at him because he started laughing when the bed collapsed while I was aching, and said to him "" either you buy a proper bedsprings instead of that cheap one you just broke, or this is the last time you see my ass"". Now every time we go to a hotel, it's our inside joke to test the resistance of the bed. "
All the time lol. I have way more fun than my straight friends do
It really warms my heart reading this story tho‚ô•Ô∏è
"I'm going to come up here with a revolutionary idea: maybe it depends on the particular person and not only on what sexual practices he's into? 

I personally like this type of stuff as long as it's light and funny. Also, when I want to fuck with someone I expect to be sexualized and objectified as long as it's not degrading. But I'm vers, what the hell do I know!"
"Yes! Do this.

It will help from getting more stupid questions in the future.  You can also respond in a way where you act like you think they are flirting with you."
Yes but TBH can be a double edged sword because maybe increased sensitivity will make it harder for you to last a good long time. Probably most reliable way to shoot huge loads is edging and getting quite close to coming a few times in a longer session before finally letting go.

"Having been with several men over the years I've seen cocks of all sizes and shapes. Some are thicker some are thinner some are longer or shorter. And all of them are normal and beautiful.  Although a lot of people worry or are insecure about their size it's really because we ever really only see the big cocks in media. I've heard of people who thought 7 or 8 inches was average.  The real average is closer to 5 inches and if you think about what average means, that means there are as many people smaller than that as larger. While a big dick is visually impressive I know lot of people who actually dont like having one. It's too big for them to enjoy blowjobs without teeth and can cause pain for their partners. I've also met guys with smaller dicks who didnt feel like they had the right equipment to top. Whatever the size, all dicks feel good and can be used in a variety of ways for pleasure. I say just enjoy the fantastic feelings your cock gives you and dont worry about anything else ;)"
