"This explains my in-laws 


They are terrified of pressing every button there is"
Back in the early 2000's I got smacked with international cell charges. I was in Detroit and was close enough to connect to Windsor towers. I learned the hard way to turn off roaming...when that was still a thing.
"&gt;[EA] bills her customer at $200/hr

I mean I heard about the microtransaction gouging but this is ridiculous"
"As soon as I hear someone threaten lawyer I immediately tell them “Since this has become a legal matter I must refer you to our legal department (provide number) and then close the call. 

99% of the time its some ploy from a customer thinking it will change the call in their favor. It. Never. Does."
Yeah I thought college kids would understand technology a little bit better. I was very very wrong.
"It’s a tech item. Therefore, you know its whereabouts at all times. Concluded. I deal with that a lot with company laptops."
"I'm not sure who scares me the most, the ones who dare not click, or those who click wildly without paying any attention to whatever message the box they just OKed had on it."
The fact QA pulled exactly that call makes it funny. Could this be because it was abnormally short?
"Just reply to the ticket 'Due to having to restore data for the removed user, this procedure will take a few days. User will be re-activated wednesday or thursday'.

Then, sit back and enjoy having to do nothing for that ticket."
"&gt; “oh, I had to enter a password.”

So what you are truly telling me is that you are not willing to even try.

Neither am I.  Let me know how it all works out.

I despise people like this.

I did a little bit of time on Helpdesk, what I hated the worst where people who would absolutely refuse to reboot there computers and then fucking lie about it.

I no longer do anything really help desk, but I do some support where the help desk will send me user tickets.  We did this migration that went....about as well as I expected it to go.  I quickly figured out that when the migration was completed on each machine if you didn't reboot you would get strange fucked up problems till you rebooted - they would never emerge again.

So just last week Help desk called me, the problem was up my alley but they mentioned the migration had happened to that user that day and the problem was weird.  So I instructed help desk, 'Have them reboot.  If it is still a problem after the reboot - send them my way.'.

So I call up the user an hour later and immediatly ask about the reboot (cause all users are liars) and was told, and I quote, 'Yes I reboote, I reboot every night when I go home.  I just rebooted yestrday.'.

WTF is wrong with people?"
"&gt;She yells, ""Since when??!""

&gt;I literally say, ""I don't know how to answer that. Since 1776, I think?"" (I said that because I don't know when Canada became a country.)

We became a country in 1867. Prior to that, Canada was a collection of British colonies just like the US was prior to the revolutionary war. Canada has never been part of the USA (nor the US part of Canada, for that matter).

Anyway, I can see Michigan from *my* town, so maybe I'll grab myself some maple leaf flags and go claim some territory... that's how it works, right? Like calling shotgun? First one to see the other country gets it!"
"In Finland near the Finland-Russian border, there's several Russian carriers that have coverage on Finland's side.

Those operators used to charge like 10€ per megabyte for roaming, which caused nasty bills to Finns in the area, who had their phones accidentally connect to the Russian carrier."
"&gt; it was abnormally short?

That's what his wife said."
I get paid to reset passwords and to turn off outlook’s offline mode
"For the Americans, I'm going to point out that in the UK all outlets have an on/off switch. (I'm assuming OP is British, a brief glance at his comment history showed at least one pound symbol.)"
Think you were being phished possibly
"It's actually a ""surprise mechanic"" and is actually quite ethical."
Sounds like they maybe used a Wii before a computer!
"Customer: I would like to buy a gallon of milk.

  


Cashier: sure thing, here is your gallon of mil that you paid for.

  


Customer: how dare you, the recipe called for 1 and a half gallons of milk. How dare you limit my milk usage. How am I supposed to get the boys to my yard like this. I'm suing you."
I like Dilbert too. He deserves a bag of Swedish fish.
"My favorite words out of any customers mouth.   
“Thank you for absolving me of the burden of dealing with you,please come again”."
Gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment
"This (along with it being recommended best practice) is why we have gone from 'make everyone an admin on their own computer' to 'make sure everyone is logging in with their standard account but has an admin account to install apps with'.

While we still get a handful of 'woops I installed 17 toolbars', it's a lot less."
"Good assumptions, thanks! Talking of the pound symbol; the amount of users that call me saying “Microsoft verification is asking me to press the pound key but there is no £ key showing” ... yup that’s the # key."
That's straight up small claims court right there.
"I feel your pain.  I've had to deal with the ""They're fired!... No, wait..."" Thing a time or two.

One of my personal favorites was the time I got a termination notice in the morning, but the Manager left out the all important ""...at 2:00"" part.  User knocked on my door as his badge didn't work (I did ALL of the accounts, small company) because his badge didn't work (which happened every so often, due to being mutilated or just wearing out), jokingly asking me if he's been fired.  I was like ""Follow me, please.  Oh, and I'll need your badge.""  Took him to dad manager.  The Manager apologized later to his credit, realizing that was VERY awkward for me."
What is so special about your DSL-cable that makes it so yummy? What do they taste like? Are you supposed to add sauce or condiments? Does he eat other cables too?
It was both short and long. It was too long for a misrouted call and too short for a resolved issue. Misrouted calls are about 1 minute long at most and resolved issues are at least 7 minutes long because of documenting the interaction.
"Wow, that's dumb."
"You should have got marked A+ for going above and beyond.

You didn't keep the client on the phone long, and you even went to their home to personally deal with the problem for them.

Top marks from me!"
"this actually makes me sad... and not just the whole senior citizen thing,

but the fact that there are people who would do pretty much anything for a sell, not really care for the quality or after-service,

and completely dont care about the person they are selling something to...."
"There's a third type:

I don't know what this does. I need to know, so I'll turn it off and wait for someone to scream."
"yep, sounds like a phishing attack.  they probably tried to find someone else to ""help "" them.

I'd have expected one of the deans to start bothering you for the ""Shush"" keys next.  One of ""his contractors""  needs it"
"There are two kinds of people:

1.  I don't know what this does.  I'm going to turn it off.

2.  I don't know what this does.  I'm going to leave it the hell alone.

Be the second type."
Wasn't worth trying to turn it on while on site? Never take a clients word for it.
You don’t have a good boss. You have a great boss!
"Nope, what’s dumb is when I worked for a cellphone company and we took international calls (billing and tech for US customers traveling or calling internationally) and one of my AGENTS asked which country Montana is in."
Something something Schrodinger's keyboard
"I'd push it, but the value of going to small claims court is not going to be worth the time invested for me since I'm moving and going full-time with my business.

At the end of the day I'm not out any money, just time and unsold inventory (which I took as a gamble out of curiosity anyway)."
"I have worked at law firms for almost my whole career, started as a secretary and moved into technical training.

And I have had this same conversation regarding literally everything that has to do with technology. I mean, I love working in law firms (they just make sense to me) but I am surrounded by really, REALLY smart people who do really, REALLY stupid shit."
"The more I read these posts the more I realize common sense is not so common.

You know they say you can't fix stupid? Well, I can hit it with a 2 x 4 till it goes away."
The equivalent happened on the Swedish border before rates dropped to a more reasonable level.
"Surely if you're even able to verify that, your company is not storing passwords correctly?"
Put a 100 GHz sticker on each monitor.
"""Went to client's house and fixed issue.  Client was happy with fix and fucked me as payment."""
"It's a lovely generic grey with a sticker that says ""DSL"", very appealing tbh

And well he never at the yellow LAN cables we send with the modem because those were still connected to the TV. It really was only the DSL."
Rookie mistake for the co-worker. Intern has better tech skills than CO.
"So the OP was kinda right... the US (officially) declared itself independent from Britain in 1776, parts of modern day Canada were a British colony at that point, so they ceased being part of the same group."
"I got accused of that once and since I was about to put my 2 weeks in anyway, I schooled him on what insubordination really was, and that simply telling him what he was asking about was written on the work order was not insubordination, but that him grabbing me by the arm and jabbing his finger in my chest was assault..."
"I think my favorite example of that was a story where someone's boss told them to change the entire office to macs.  

But the boss didn't want to deal with getting new software and training, so the tech was ordered to change the OS to Windows.  

But he didn't want to make it seem like he'd bought several dozen extremely expensive computers to get rid of the main reason they were expensive, so the tech was told to download and install a theme to make it look like iOS.  

I think that a lot of people got suckered into the idea that macs were better, but they needed Windows to actually do stuff.
So, combine the ""best"" of both worlds."
"&gt; 'make sure everyone is logging in with their standard account but has an admin account to install apps with'.

That... doesn’t really sound much better."
"On the other hand, he slept with the client, which is a bit of an ethical faux pas."
"She sounds like a consultant that I replaced.   


I was hired in on a contract by an organization and reported to the consultant. After a few months the organization hired me on full and wanted me to start taking control over the duties of the consultant. We were in the middle of the project with an outside source and the consultant started dropping F bombs in a meeting. The CEO heard about it and ended her contract soon after.   


Since her departure, I have found several things that gave me concern about conflicts of interest that that the consultant had been doing and have heard from vendors of some situations that were very questionable!"
You mean you didn't get your Tech Dowsing Certification?
"My first IT job at a university was the same. Got paid $7 an hour to take paper from next to the printer and refill the trays. Then sit at the walk up helpdesk and tell students ""no i cannot recover your paper that disappeared and you have no backups of"""
