"Any fans who refer to themselves as stans.

Stan was a psychopath who drove off a bridge with his gf in the trunk of his car"
"About 30 years ago, I worked a short temp run as an maintenance man/janitor and, dear Jesus, I worked with just about the dumbest pair of human beings you can imagine.  The younger guy, Terry, was really fair-complected, hair so orange you could see it from space.  One night, he came in sporting a fresh flat top haircut, which was short enough that it partially revealed as heretofore unseen birthmark on the top of his pale head.  Joking, I said ""You know what, Terry?  If I had a birthmark that cool... I'd keep my hair buzzed all the way off.""  The next night I was clocking in, turned to my left, and nearly died of shame.  That poor, thick fuck had shaved his head.    


The three of us would be the only ones in the building, overnights, and we'd normally stop around 3:00 and have our lunch.  Most nights, I'd open the back door of the business, grab a copy of the freshly-delivered USA Today, and read it while we ate.  Early on, I'd occasionally read them something I thought they might think was interesting.  Soon enough, I was spending all of every lunch reading to them.  I felt like a missionary/lol.  Anyway, the morning the Jeff Dahmer story broke, I was reading them the accounts --serial killer, upwards of 20 victims, apartment was full of rotting cadavers, he apparently was eating some of them-- and Terry, bless his thick head, says ""Man, those guys must have really pissed him off...""  I said ""Terry, there were 18 or 19 victims.  He was killing them just because he loved killing them.""  And Terry, Ed nodding along, says ""I don't know, Stan, I bet I could get that pissed...""    


One night, I asked him how it was that he'd come to move to our city (which routinely would turn up on Money Magazine's list of ""Best Places to Live"" at something like #297 out of 300/lol) and Terry earnestly told me ""Oh, my wife and I want to have some of the finer things in life... Like a washer and a dryer... maybe a dog.""  I'm often tempted to look him up, just to see how he's gotten along, but Jesus..."
"I feel like they didn't innovate much. 

Even in it's IPod days, Jobs pushed for a way to make software fluid and intuitive. Not innovative. 

It was always about make things happen with as little effort as possible. Once it became the norm, they pretty hovered around bringing what the other 15 manufacturers have brought up to the masses. And honestly it makes no sense to expect Apple to out do 10+ engineering teams trying to come with new gadgets to make their phone stand out. It's just annoying how it just becomes iSomething and suddenly my Apple Stan friend acts like I didn't have a phone 3 years ago doing that."
