"Haha - I don’t get jealous anymore but my favorite Williamsburg convo.

Random Barista: “Oh my god I’m like soooo broke. I had to eat pizza like every day last week.”

Me: “Oh I’m sorry. Me and my friends are gonna bartend this event in a few weeks for extra cash, if you want I can put in a word.”

RB:”Oh that sounds SUPER fun but I’m gonna be in Paris for 2 months after I go scuba diving off the coast of Martinique.”

Me: “Cool”"
"I pay attention to my own shit and ignore everyone else.  You, thru your hardwork, run around with a class of people that has stuff handed to them.

Either make peace with that, or find a new group of people to hang with.  They didn't do anything wrong, they were born lucky.  It happens. You being jealous of them is a purely 100% you problem."
"To note, there's 2 types of burgers that people are suggesting here:

1. Fast Food style, thin patties.  These are about 6.35mm thick (ie 1/4 inch), will be cooked all the way through, and I think they should be eaten as a double cheese burger, with lettuce, onion and ketchup (or mustard), I think tomato causes structural instability, but it's pretty classic.  It's all about the crust, not so much the delicious meat, but more about what happens when it meets a hot griddle.  Served on a squishy roll, I'm generally happiest when it's a martin's potato roll (Shake Shack).  This is Burger Joint, 5 guys, and Shack Shack.
2. Pub style burgers.  These will be about 25mm thick, the common wisdom is that you should order it medium rare (cool, pink center) just like a steak (but you do you, order it how you'd order a steak).  These burgers are about both that wonderful crust AND the delicious meat.  Like a good sausage, it's about what meat and fat you decide to put into your grind that really makes it sing (or fall flat).  This burger can be gussied up with all sorts of toppings, but I'm not a fan.  For a really good burger I just want some caramelized onions, and that's it (maybe a really good dijon).  The roll should be heartier to not fall apart under the burger, which should be juicy af.  This is Hurleys, any steak house, and 5 napkins.

For thin patties, I suggest either Shake Shack or Burger Joint, they both have equally good burgers I think.  Shake Shack has better fries (frozen, extruded, covered in amazing cheese sauce), and a little bit more in the ways of options for toppings (I still just get a double shack burger).  Burger Joint is an experience, it's fun.  5 guys is mediocre and is over priced, it's designed to be hidden under a pile of toppings.

For a pub style burger, I'd suggest **not** 5 napkins or bare burger.  Neither of them are really good at actually cooking a burger (it's hit or miss), so instead they hide them under a mountain of fixings.  Steak houses are always a safe bet (often you want to get it at lunch) since they should know how to cook meat to MR.  Unfortunately, my favorite burgers are in Queens, not particularly friendly to your location.

There's a 3rd type, that I call 'diner burgers', pre formed (often bought frozen), perfectly cylindrical, incredibly uniform, generally uninteresting.  Good for loading up with all sorts of toppings (BBQ sauce, American cheese and french fries makes me happy).  I generally order these medium as I honestly don't trust anyplace that sells these to cook a good MR.  Unsurprisingly, you mostly get these at mediocre diners."

"This is soo weirdly common.    
People complain about being broke... working maybe 6 months out of the year and spend half of it traveling.  I wonder why you're always short on money and have insane credit card debt. It's almost like budgeting is a foreign  concept, but they tend to have college or even advanced  degrees. It's impossible to make it that far and really not understand the very basics right?!"
I have nightmares about the 14th street Trader Joe's.
Hello.  Am Russian Oligarch.  Is very good place to store money. 
"Who cares man. For every person richer than you in NYC there’s one who is way poorer than you.

It’s also a mistake to assume they all get it from their parents. I’m probably in the upper percentiles but I come from illegal immigrants and grew up sharing a bedroom with 2 siblings in a basement apartment. On the flip side there is no shortage of trust fund babies who end up sleeping on sidewalks in the East Village. 

Just focus on your own shit. There will always be people better and worse off. And not everyone better off had it easier than you."
it helps to have an apartment where you can escape the grind. it's surprising what you get used to over time.. It wasn't until I left the city for a weekend and noticed the trader joe's in that city was empty and the aisles were double-wide that I realized how crowded nyc is.
"NYC is as crowded as tourists say it is ... in the places that are incredibly crowded with tourists. It's a lot less crowded one avenue over or a few streets away.

It definitely can be fast-paced. I can't compare it to other major cities as well because I haven't lived in other cities.

It is indeed very expensive. I'm not sure about more or less than depicted. I'm not sure about rental price per foot. I think median purchase price per square foot for buying an apartment is about $1400 ... yes ... per foot. In Manhattan, that's a very reasonable price.

The burbs are like burbs anywhere I think, except that there is public transportation for commuting to the city. Commutes are much longer than in many areas. Commuters into Manhattan often have 1 or even up to 2 hours of commute ... each way."
For that budget you can get a really nice luxury rental in queens if you’re ok with the travel. 
"&gt; the low-key rich who still identify as ""middle class"" despite having no financial worries

Those bastards saving their money and not rubbing in everyone's faces. 

I kid but seriously this feels like imposter syndrome. Shit's just expensive around here. Nothing one single person can really do about it. And if you think it's bad here you really ought to check out San Francisco. That place is deeply depressing. "
"What? No. Your agent is a crook. I was an auto claims adjuster in New York as of last year (screw that career path unless you really like job security) and your premiums are based off of your history which is saved to a database called ISO as well as past insurer records and criminal history. These don't just ""disappear"" if you cancel your insurance. 

On the other hand, your premiums may be grandfathered in at a lower rate. This is probably not the case, but nevertheless even if you cancel you'll never go back to ""17-year old"" rates.

Get a new agent."

"Sadly, once you ask, he knows he has got you..  I guess the best thing to do, is to make his life hell in return.. I mean, the best thing to do is get out of that shitty situation as, no money is worth living with mold or in an abusive unhealhy environment.. But, if you want to maximize your pay out, make his life hell, call EPA and everyone and just make a big stink.. eventually he will pay to get you out of his hair. "
"Your largest hurdle would be finding a place that could give you that square footage, be close to transit and still be low enough to make a profit. Most people wouldn’t travel out of there way for an arcade that doesn’t serve alcohol as there are many that do serve alcohol. Not serving food would be a major missed revenue stream. I think the concept has merit, but you really need to look at overall demand, competition and profit margins. If you look at it there are at least 6 “barcade” type establishments that I’m aware of, but they have booze as a draw as well, so you need to consider that."
Just a guy name Frank or?
"Yeah, welcome to hood post offices. I've been complaining about the post office on 3rd ave and 188 in the Bronx for literally over a decade and it only gets worse. Frankly I wish I could tell you the answer and it is kind of endearing the other posters are suggesting the postmaster or congress but I've actually tried this and nothing. It is a fucking joke. If you ever want to see others screaming into the void about this look at the one I mentioned or the E Tremont Ave post office Google reviews."
"$40k with a $1000 a month studio in Queens. 

Fyi median household income in nyc is 50k."
"It depends on how much you think you'd use it. Roofdecks, pools, etc are incredibly valuable if you actually use them but a huge wasted expense if it's a once a year use"
"My all time fave is Aire Ancient Baths, your mom will feel so pampered and blissed out by the time she's done."
"I manage the construction of such buildings.  It will be mostly occupied.  And contrary to perception, it will not be majority Russians and Chinese.  It will be financial industry folks, the upper end of doctors, and a fair number of retirees from such industries."
Burger joint (inside the le parker meredien) on 56th between 6th and 7th! 
French people looooooooove Brooklyn
"$80,000/year "
"Yep. I have friends who make 6 figures that still have almost no money to their name. It's largely because all of their friends act the same. Many of them are just kids who are suddenly making tons of money in the finance or tech markets. Good friend of mine called it ""Monopoly money."" He hasn't cooked food in months.

I make significantly less than some of my friends, which makes it difficult for me to give them financial advice. I'm trying to find a good financial advisor out here just for that purpose – I'd recommend them to my friends, and they'd act as a trusted 3rd party to deliver the advice that I can't.

If anyone has recommendations for a fiduciary financial advisor in the BK area, lmk"
If you ask to be paid to leave you're going to get a shit amount compared to if they ask you to leave. 
"I would live in Harlem, Queens, or Brooklyn "
"$100,000 is absolutely middle class in NYC."
"Sounds like a good number of  people working at cafes and some rando ass shops selling crystals  I've encountered in Brooklyn on the agreement with the bank of mom and dad that they still get funds floated their way and access to accounts as long as they technically are working. 

Some I know was dating this trustfunded guy who's parents ""swore they heard tons of gunshots like a war"" when they stayed over their place at the corner of Disneyland and Yuppieville in Williamsburg, that the parents straight up said, ""we will cover your rent if you move to a safer place like East Village"". 

So this dude had his $3300/month 1BR covered by his parents and naturally would always complain how life is hell and always try to sing the blues about how broke he was. 

I've also met a lot of people who've told me verbatim that because they didn't finish college their parents have no qualms with using theoretical money that could've been used for schooling for them to ""experience NYC"" just to say that they got out of bumfuck middle America.

You can live within NYC and still have a 1 hour commute.  That’s what blew my mind when I moved here.
"If limited to your area of choice, it would have to be a studio."
"NYC has a completely free help line called NYC Well for mental health support.  They can provide immediate and short term counseling, and I believe they're also trained to help you seek out a longer term care partnership that is either free or low cost.  It's so great that you've recognized you're not in a great place.  I hope you consider reaching out, and that things start feeling better soon: [https://nycwell.cityofnewyork.us/en/](https://nycwell.cityofnewyork.us/en/)

If you're concerned you're at risk of harming yourself, Lifeline is free of charge and has people trained to help you navigate emergency health crises.

"I like that my apartment is new, has responsive management, has a good gym, and is very near to the subway. I don’t like that the design is bland and the kitchen and bathrooms are super underwhelming. Also I like that it was a lot easier to get than dealing with a broker. "

This is the best burger write-up I've ever seen. 
"Yeah NYC can be a financial mindfuck once you start meeting people. I first came here from a relatively upper-middle-class community and expected to have it better than many of my peers. NOPE, I took for granted just how heavily the world's financial elite, in particular their children, cram into a few international cities. Most of these kids are completely unaware of the bubble they occupy, or the degree to which they do. But at the same time, I also have it better than the majority of NYC residents, so it's really all relative.

Bottom line is to not make it a competition cause you won't win, and know when to tell rich friends that you can't do ""that expensive thing"" they take for granted instead of ruining yourself financially trying to keep up. Don't let that crazy money bubble warp your perspective on life. The world they live in is *not* normal.

I've since lost touch with most of those casually wealthy kids, it's not worth sticking with them and I find that when you try to get them to do more casual low-cost stuff they likewise lose interest in you. Not worth it."
"&gt; Hot water must be provided 365 days per year at a constant minimum temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

Get a thermometer, measure the water temp, take a picture / video, show the super, if he still doesn't fix it call the city."
"That depends on various factors. Are you expecting to live as a middle class person or willing to be 'poor', for example?"

"If this was 3 years ago, 90%.
Next year 2019, 75%.

Remember, there are over 80+ billionaires in NYC.
(And almost 2000 more outside of NYC)"
I'm a doorman in one of these buildings and can confirm these are my residents. #1. Finance people #2 high end doctors #3 Random Chinese business people and literally only 2 or 3 random Russian millionaires. 
"Margon. GREAT Dominican* food. It gets slammed at lunch, because it’s in almost the center of Times Square. But it’s ridiculously good. Go in the morning for Cuban coffee.

EDIT: I was corrected, they are a Dominican restaurant that serves Cuban sandwiches/coffee."
"You don't have to be anywhere near a billionaire to buy a $5 - $15 mil apartment 

I know quite a few of my friend's parents that have apartments like that, and while they are very well off they are nowhere near to being billionaires "
"My friend got his license at 18 and hadn't driven since. At 30, when he was about to have kids, he decided to learn how to drive because he hadn't in over a decade. His wife added him to her insurance and her rates actually went down, because he had had his license for over a decade with no claims or tickets. "
"Probably at least 65-70,000 then."

"I don’t know about a food tour but Jackson’s Heights / Corona is the true melting pot of NYC. No neighborhood in NYC is more diverse and with flavors rich. 

Everything from Argentina  geographical up to Mexican and jump across to a wide spectrum of Asia. Even the Flushing food courting Andrew Zimmerman described as all regions of China from the mountains to the ocean. Of course go down Northern Blvd for Korean. 

You can even go across to Astoria for Greek on Ditmars Blvd and over to Steinway St for little Middle Eastern flavors and up Queens Blvd for Russian / Polish experience. Go over to Richmond Hill for flavors of the Caribbean. 

There may not be a fancy food tour but in terms of true diversity these are the areas for it. "
"Agreed. I’ve lived alone in a $35k salary paying $1,000 a month in Glendale, Queens. It was far but tolerable. "
"True that, comparison is the enemy of happiness. I find that for me, using less social media really helps since a lot of the people I follow are very well off and travel all the time or eat tasty stuff all the time, and I feel like I would just compare my life and theirs, and feel down about it. It's really not good to compare. "
"With the ridiculous housing prices, I'd rather rent a cool spot in a dope neighborhood and spend my money going to 70 different countries than have a house in a sensible neighborhood lol"
"I lived in one of these and found we didn’t take enough advantage of the extras to really make it worth it. The one thing I really enjoyed was the pool, but after I ended up with an injury and wasn’t able to go as much I realised how much extra I was paying for but not using. My building also had a really good gym with free Pilates, yoga, etc but the hours didn’t end up working with my schedule and I was often away. 

I think if you were going to use the amenities it would be worth it. They weren’t any extra charge at all and I know a lot of people in my building used them frequently. For me it didn’t make sense to keep paying more for something I rarely used, but I think it really comes down to you whether it’s worth it or not. "
