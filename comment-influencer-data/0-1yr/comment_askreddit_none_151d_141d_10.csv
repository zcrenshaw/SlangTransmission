"In woodwork my friend pulled out his phone to search up designs to burn into his wood (Not meant to have phones in woodwork)
After that someone asked him ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the time‚Äù instead of looking at his phone he looked at his watch. About a minute later someone else asked him ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the time‚Äù once again he looked at his watch. 

Since then he has proved himself to be quite dumb.

"Who said anything about atrophy?  That‚Äôs what happens when you don‚Äôt exercise.  And no reason for rudeness.  You can build muscle that is stronger but leaner.  Doing high weight low rep exercises will make you stronger than someone who does lower weight, middle rep exercises.  The best way to build muscle size is to maintain a weight where you can do about 10-13 reps with proper form.  Someone who does higher weights so they max out at 5 reps per set will become stronger but not as big.  Now both weightlifters will be able to get huge if they are working out consistently, and of course each builder will get stronger as they get bigger and vice versa, but the person who lifts more weight but gets less of the ‚Äúpump‚Äù will get stronger faster than they get big.

I suggest watching Pumping Iron.  It‚Äôs a great documentary that can give some insight into how building muscle actually works.  I would also suggest watching Nanny 911.  It can give you insight into how you can change your behavior instead of acting like a spoiled child who rushes to throw insults"
"A lot of the time, if someone is tailgating me as I'm passing they zip over to the right before I'm a safe distance in front of the person I'm passing. Especially if I'm passing a semi - they'll zip right and pass me there with barely a car length between them and the giant truck."
Look at it this way. Do you really want to be in a relationship with someone that communicates important things like interest and attraction by dropping vague hints? Ya dodged a bullet.

"I agree. America has become an extremely liberal country, they can't make jokes about anything anymore. The guy who made the Vietnam colony joke would be fired immediately in the US and probably blacklisted from the industry.

In Europe we don't have as much protection for the freedom of speech in general, but are still allowed to be authentic and politically incorrect, so to speak."
Inhaling it is definitely more dangerous than injecting it.
Russia even in its weakened economic and military state still has more of an international presence than France or Germany.
"Whelp, my (white) ancestors immigrated to the American south in the early 1800s and owned cotton and peanut farms. My great grandmother still has our ""family bible"" which is sort of a written history of our family, and it mentions numbers and names of slaves that were forced to work on said farms. It's really disheartening and I do everything I can to check my white privilege since that's the only thing I can control."
Using the idea of being gay as an insult is homophobic.

"So... By your logic, when you're familiar with someone, you're more okay with being touched inappropriately by them?

If you closely examine rape and sexual assault statistics, the vast majority of them are perpetrated by people *known* and trusted by the victim- close friends, family, and immediate relatives.

Just because you're familiar, doesn't mean you cannot feel violated by the actions of a loved one."

"For how long this story was, it was dramatically uninteresting."
They get really deep if you care about paying attention to the characters and their motivations. But if you go into it without caring then you won't begin to get invested and you won't enjoy it. I'm not saying you have to care I just think that people see those movies as being more shallow than they actually are.

"Whenever a movie is getting hyped based on racial &amp; gender basis, it turns out be disappointing. Wonder Woman &amp; Captain Marvel was high disappointing because of storyline &amp; subpar acting. Acting is what Sam &amp; Jaime showed in GOT S8E1. Captain Marvel's existence turned out to be a lie &amp; she acted like nothing happened, it really disturbed me. Brie &amp; Kid was annoying was af. Only thing I liked about the film is acting of Sam Jackson."

"Hah! Look at this comment and thread and tell me that society isnt sick. The kids are born to parents who dont want them, in a failed relationship, they're abused, undoubtedly manipulated, and given all the power they need to ruin their parents name at such a young age, and people are still blaming the kid.

No, the kids actions are a symptom of a larger problem, namely that OP had a child irresponsibly, and the child's father clearly didn't want him, and his uncle was even worse. That kid is reacting to his situation, and his situation is a world of shit. 

What he did was use the only power he has in his life right now, probably because his parents hate each other (beyond his control) he was sexually abused (beyond his control) his family is broken (beyond his control) is it any fucking wonder he's lashing out? Can anyone claim they wouldnt lash out in these circumstances even as an adult? 

OP, you fucked up by not being absolutely sure that relationship wouldnt fuck itself at soon another kid came into the equation. You and his father are responsible for every single bad thing that has happened to that child. He has every right to hate you, and his father too. I don't blame him one bit."
