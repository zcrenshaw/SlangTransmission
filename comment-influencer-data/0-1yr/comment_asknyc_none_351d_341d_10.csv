Cause a scene. Why would you not want to cause a scene? 
"Thirded! Cause as scene!

Don't be afraid to call out the pervert who is grinding against you. Remaining silent only encourages them to continue the behavior. 

**Don't be embarrassed. This is not your fault and you didn't ask for this.** NYers on the subway are savvy and experienced enough to know that ""grinding"" happens and if a woman calls out for help or starts yelling at the guy, they will be on your side. I once started a scene when someone was grinding against me on a rush hour subway and the crowd chased the pervert off. 

You have to learn to be vocal and defend yourself, especially in this city.

You can shout ""Can anyone help me, someone is groping me!"". Or turn and face the guy and say loudly ""STOP GROPING ME, YOU PERVERT!"" Most of the time the pervert will run away because they are cowards who prey on women and hope that they will be too timid to cause a scene. Scare them, stomp on their foot, do SOMETHING.

**A predator's greatest weapon is the silence of their victims.**  

I suggest you take a self defense course so you become comfortable with yelling and defending yourself.  My friend took Krav Maga self defense classes that gave her confidence and empowerment to defend herself and be vocal in a situation like that.  Check Yelp for Krav Maga self defense classes near you. 

You are your best weapon. Protect yourself and your body."
"Get hammered every Tuesday night, it’s less crowded and there’s usually a deal on mussels or wings. "
"After 14 years of commuting on the subway, I suggest a loud and aggressive “Don’t fucking touch me!”"

Just kidding. And, I'm 55 and married for 31 years, as background. I don't know if any of my interests will overlap with yours. But, here are a few suggestions.

1. Check [goldstar](https://www.goldstar.com/login) for things that interest you. It's free to join and has discounted tickets to a bunch of different types of things.

2. Science and other lectures, if you like events centered around learning. The [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/calendar) has lectures after hours; check out SciCafe if you want to mix drinking and science. [Secret Science Club](http://secretscienceclub.blogspot.com/) is definitely not a secret and is in a fun venue; free but a small donation is nice; drinks at the full bar are not free. [Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/All-GC-Events/GC-Presents) has lectures on a variety of subjects, often political.

3. [Ranger led walks in the city parks.](https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/urbanparkrangers)

4. Historical walks in various neighborhoods of the city.

   https://www.bigonion.com/ -- Did you know New York was once called the Big Onion before it was the Big Apple?

   nycdiscovery@gmail.com -- Don't think they have a website but you can email them to get on their list and get their current schedule of walks."
"&gt;A predator's greatest weapon is the silence of their victims.

YES.  They want you to be ashamed, and ""not want to cause a scene.""  Fuck them and fuck that. NYC is for scenes. "
"Contact the news, it’ll be fixed in a week."
"I have written countless Notices to Cure and Notices to Terminate for people urinating, defecating, fornicating and leaving used condoms on our building's roofs.  Your super's story doesn't make me blink.  It absolutely happens all the fucking time.  However we have security cameras on our roofs with no problem and that's how we know who the perpetrators are.  We don't forward to the police though.  It's hardly/barely a criminal issue.  We just begin holdover eviction proceedings against the tenants who are doing it.  If it's not a tenant, there's not much we can do other than try to secure the roof from access.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading your post more closely, your renter's insurance should cover the damage.  This isn't flooding that you're describing so definitely don't call it that.  It's damage from a leak/ceiling collapse.  That also happens all the time and is squarely within the purview of renter's insurance to cover your damages.   What goes on on the roof should not really be your concern.  Your landlord's responsibility should be to repairing your ceiling.  You can call 311 to trigger an HPD inspection if they don't make timely repairs inside your aprtment.  How your landlord and super deal with the roof is up to them."
"It could also be a stalker, a **sick** dude smelling her undies. Tell her to get a security camera with txt alerts. I would not be chill about something like that."
"I really like Carl Schurz park. Super safe location (next to Gracie Mansion), and you get great views of the east river. "
Thanks. That damn jingle will be on my head all day now. 
"My greatest wish is to see a resurgence in Mitchell-Lama projects or a similar program that focuses specifically on middle income housing with no luxury/market set-aside. Not only do existing projects need to be conserved permanently but new ones should be built. I realize this is very pie-in-the-sky.

I was born and raised in an M-L and live in a different one now. It has been, without question, the only reason I've been able to spend my life in NYC as a middle class person. It's life changing and it shouldn't be so rare.

This is a bigger problem than just NYC's. Americans as a whole have become increasingly selfish, and distrustful of government programs intended to offer a leg-up to anyone who isn't ""me"". We've allowed the rich to convince us it's better to sell them publicly-owned land or assets for a pittance with minimal restrictions than to demand accountability. We keep lowering taxes and diverting money from public services. Look at the programs the city created in the 1940s/1950s to build middle and working class housing and ask yourself why - in this age of wealth beyond anything imaginable 70 years ago - we're utterly incapable of doing something similar."
"I wanted my fiancée and I to dress up as Cellino &amp; Barnes for Halloween, but I lost that case.  "
"I'm not even kidding, and hand to god I didn't believe it until I saw a screenshot of the video but-

This exact thing happened to a co-workers friend and roomates. They noticed that like every Tuesday or Thursday they would get home from work and notice that a few things in their apt were just a little bit  off. A swivel recliner was facing the wrong way, things were moved on the kitchen tables.  Nothing was ever missing, just askew. After a few weeks they decided to set up a camera, thinking maybe it was like rats or maybe like a possum/raccoon that somehow came in through an air vent or some shit.  Nope. Came back one day, saw some stuff was moved around, checked the hidden cam and saw their building super letting himself into their apartment, as well as another guy, a gal, two more guys and another gal. They all proceeded to TAKE THEIR CLOTHES OFF AND HAVE A FUCKING ORGY IN THEIR APARTMENT. Absolutely did not believe this until my co-worker who was telling the story got them to send over a screenshot of the video which clearly shows a bunch of schlubby people doin some group love type shit. Last we heard was they were lawyering the fuck up to figure out how to best capitalize on the situation. We beg him every day for updates."
Eat my bodyweight in delivery and pass out at 9 to some shitty movie
"It could have been to place a camera, it could have been a neighbor who got Locked on their own fire escape. It could have been a drunk neighbor who got confused. If she doesn’t want a police report then don’t make one for her, but make sure she figures out some way to secure that window."
"I don’t get this. Do they all have kids? 

I don’t make anywhere close to six figures and I don’t have a second job and I’m not living paycheck to paycheck. I also don’t live in a roach infested hellhole. 

(There are a few roaches)"
I can assure you I'm not a mugger looking for quiet areas to find my next victims. 
I didn't think you were a mugger before. I do now.
"Great Q. 

There will be no middle class in nyc by then. People are barely managing their bills even with secondary sources of income like Uber, room sharing etc. Folks here are in trouble and when the next market crash happens this place is going apeshit. In my humble opinion.... "
"Spend $10 on sandwich supplies, make $100 in donations.  Repeat."
"The Grey Dog on Carmine. Outside of the weekday lunch rush, it’s a nice, low-key bar/café. They have great iced teas, Arnold palmers, raspberry lemonade, etc."
"Sober NYC guy here. I think Zinc Bar on West 3rd is perfect. Jazz, cappuccinos, cocktails, couches. Not overrun with NYU kids or tourists. Excellent spot.

A coffee walk in this weather through the park and maybe out to the Hudson is a great way to get to know each and people watch, too. (Or take an actual walking tour! Get ya learn on.)

Lot of neat little hotel lobby bars too to explore. 

Shit though, are you actually my date for tonight?? lol

"you can complain anonymously - just provide evidence 

reporters will comply if you ask to remain anonymous

don’t fear for your job when doing the right thing

change comes from you, no one else"
"Once in a while someone, or a team of two, comes through with a huge bin of individually bagged sandwiches, water bottles, granola bars, etc. They say it's free if you're hungry, and they also have a cup for donations to keep it going. Usually they have t-shirts printed with something about helping the homeless, and they seem homeless themselves. Could be outreach from a shelter, could be a scam, but either way the free food makes me feel ok about giving a dollar. Seems to work on everyone else too. "
"Yeah, it’s annoying as fuck with all those assholes from Manhattan crowding into Brooklyn bars. Stay on your shitty island with all the tourists"
"For what it’s worth: my partner has celiac’s disease and just because something is “gluten-free” doesn’t meant it’s healthy. That’s a big myth that’s been popularized lately. Often times her food is more caloric than those with gluten in it. 

Good luck, I track everything I put in my face with the MyFitnessPal app and I really believe it’s the most effective was to lose weight, it’s worked great for me. "
"""I'm not, but have a wonderful holiday. Goodbye!"""
"I tell women that are new to the city that unfortunately, on the subway, it's not a matter of *if* you are accosted, it's a matter of *when* and how many fucking times a year.  Whether  it's grinding, flashing, masturbating or just plain catcalling, something is going to happen eventually that makes you uncomfortable and you have to learn to be loud and scary. 

I was born and raised in NYC and started taking the train from Astoria to Manhattan for school at 14. Of course the catholic school uniform attracted perverts. The first time I saw someone jerking off on a train I was horrified and ran away. Now, at 45, I just throw stuff at them and yell.  Same thing with grinders. I'm so fed up with them that I usually just punch them in the gut. Now that's not something I would advise someone to do, but I'm a brute. "
"Max Brenner is nice.  you can get a fancy hot chocolate of some kind and it has a date-y atmosphere.  May be a bit touristy, but still a fun time.  It's my go-to spot for all my recovering alcoholic friends."

"I warrant if ""parking lots everywhere"" is your definition of Paradise, you'd probably be happier in Dallas. "
"One time I was on a train and a woman grabbed a dude's hand and went, ""Hey did anyone lose a hand? I found this one on my ass and it's not mine!"""
"here's the thing. i know way too much about true crime, but there's a chance that if someone did break into her apartment, he might do it again. 

look up [EAR/ONS \[aka the golden state killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Killer)]. he would routinely stalk his victims for weeks. learn their habits and comings and goings. he'd break in repeatedly to undo windows, unscrew light bulbs and unlock patio doors. and then he'd show up in the middle of the night and either rape or later on, kill the victims.

the scary thing about it is that most people, after they were attacked, remembered things being out of place, seeing prowlers, hearing dogs bark, and got weird phone calls but almost none of them called the cops and made a report.

**she should make a police report.** not only will it document what happened but if it's happening to other people in the area, it  can possibly help the cops track down whoever is doing it.

*better. safe. than. sorry.* i'm not trying to freak anyone out. but this kind of stuff happens. "
"I am sorry you experienced that. It should not happen but it does.

This has been going on for years to the extent my Grandmother was quoted in a NYC newspaper in the 1920s discussing it. I need to scan and post that clipping one day.

My mom's friend's move in the 70's was to grab the guys wrist and hold the hand up and shout ""Whose hand is this?""

You should first try to reposition yourself or move. Act as if you have to get through to get off the train. Eye contact and pardon me works.

If the person follows you and does it again say ""Do not touch me."" or ""Stop doing that."" 

If you wish to invest the time, make an NYPD report. Generally it is the same people doing that and they have been arrested before. Although your testimony may not be enough  for an arrest for that one act. It may help them track where these people operate and if the guy is on parole it might be enough to violate his patrol. YMMV.

There is a transit NYPD station in Union Sq.

I have a particular dislike for the 4/5/6 platform at Union Square. The train screeching noises as they round the corner is hideous. And it's a sweat box in the summer.

Williamsburg bridge walk over it and then head to Grand Ferry Park. One my my favorite views in the city and very low key. I smoke there all the time. 
I second this. Call him out. Cause a scene. People will come through
