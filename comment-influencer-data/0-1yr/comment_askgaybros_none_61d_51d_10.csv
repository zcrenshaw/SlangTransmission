"To really hammer it home, break up with him on Grindr."
"If doing me from behind hooking his arms under my armpits, holding onto my chest and pulling me closer into him"
"It's because of people from your generation that us younger gays can live and be happy as our true selves. 
We are forever in debt to the elders of our community."
"let's flip it. what I see is that you're high achieving (you run your own company. dude. that's awesome!) and 15 years in one career and almost 20 in a relationship - - - - you're loyal.

you're a catch. it sucks your ex fiancee didn't and can't see that. but someone else sure will."
Did someone mention straight guy?! Where?!? Is he in here?! I think he has a crush on me! He totes thinks I’m just one of his bros but I gonna make it sexual.
"Be affectionate. No matter what we're doing I want him to show affection. I want to be able to see it on his face when he's resting inside me, and to see it in his eyes when he cums. That satisfies me more than anything else."
"This will undoubtedly get downvoted.  Bear with me. 

Everyone deserves a second chance. We all make mistakes. We all do dumb shit. Yes - he blew his second chance. But you have nothing to be ashamed about. You took the high road and gave him the benefit of the doubt. Once. That's admirable. Giving someone a pass - once - shows your humanity and forgiveness. 

You have every right to be mad. But you should not be ashamed or embarrassed. He took advantage of you a second time, and you called it off. You know what that says? That you value you.  

And good lord - I'm not defending him. At all. I'm defending you - you acted like a compassionate, forgiving, and benevolent human. It looks like you have a good sense of empathy and boundaries.  

You have nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about. It sounds like you are a good person that likes to see the good in people. Yes - It didn't work out for you this time. But you did the right thing - at least in my opinion.  Keep that attitude. 

That said - the loser doesn't deserve you. Fuck him and never look back."
Being a top doesn't mean you don't suck dick. It just means you don't take dick up your arse
It’s a mix of desperation and lack of social skills
Please please please OP DO THIS.
"This works in a lot of cases. But remember that each situation is different, and advice on the internet comes from people who DO NOT KNOW YOU, your relationship, or your SO at all. 

Quick story-
Years ago I asked for advice online after a professor slammed my new (expensive) laptop shut in front of the whole class when he thought I was playing games online. Everyone who responded suggested to write a formal letter, demand apology, threaten to make him pay if damage, etc. So I did. 

Bad move. I had to work with that professor for the next 3 years. Was super awkward. Couldn't get a letter of recommendation from him. Totally regret sending the letter, even though it was a dick move on his part. Those people on the internet didn't have to live with my decision, but I did. 

Just saying that, sure, it seems obvious-- SO cheats? breakup. I am the son of a marriage counselor so I know there are a lot of reasons people cheat. Taking catch-all ""BREAKUP"" advice from internet strangers isn't always the answer. At least let OP talk, listen to the circumstances. that's all"
He is putting your health in danger. Run away.
You have a 10-year-old’s haircut. Go to a decent barbershop and treat yourself to an adult haircut.
"One time a guy was fucking me missionary and he noticed my head was about to hit the headboard and he stopped and so gently grabbed my head and said “watch out there bud...didn’t want you to bang your head” then he pulled us further down the bed and continued pounding. It was really sweet, actually"
Ma’am this is a wendy’s
"This is going to sound harsh, but I think you need to hear it. 

The problem here isn’t his behavior, it’s your expectations. It sounds very much like the only reason you interact with him is what you want to get from him, sexually and romantically. Meanwhile, he’s putting a lot of effort into being a good friend to you.

If you value him as a person, and not a tool for your gratification, then you need to tell him what’s going on and take a step back until your feelings pass. Sounds like he’s the kind of guy who will understand. If not, then you dodged a bullet.

Speaking from personal experience, some of my best friends have been people who I crushed on or who crushed on me. Once it passes, the things you like about that person will still be there, and can be the foundation of a valuable friendship."
They don't care. If they cared they wouldn't have ghosted you...
"Fuck me while in missionary position and kissing me while doing it. Also, if he’s fit, to flex while fucking me."
Pushing it all the way in while I finish. Clenching on a cock while cumming is the best thing
"This. I get ""affection erections."" I won't even be horny, but being able to touch and caress a man just gives me a stiffy. I love affection and love to give it."
Over-grooming. Especially eyebrows.
"In the good old days before apps, I had a guy approach me week after week in the same gay bars and clubs we've both frequented. Week after week I just turned him away with a short ""not interested"". Until one day I got irritated enough to ask him what the hell is he hoping to achieve. To which he casually replied ""well, I AM interested, and you may change your mind one day"". Never did, but it stopped annoying me. Actually chatted to him a few times. Nice enough guy. Just nor my type."
"Do it. 

Just be careful of not taking advantage of someone in pain. It can be confusing for both of you."
"That would be a good addition to the app, some guys in my area are more on that side of things over random hookups"
I just want a boyfriend who i can get really clingy with and really prefers cuddling to sex
"Well, before we even get into bed. DON’T FUCKING FLAKE. It takes some? most? Of us a lot of time and preparation for a dick appointment."
"OP, thank you. I am in my late 40s. I have alot - and I mean alot - of regrets.  Not going to hijack the post, but maybe as one here that believes in my own way about God, you are a message destined for me to see.

I was feeling really crappy this am.  Career, non existent relationship etc here.

I hid in the closet and played peekaboo with my sexuality.

Maybe your post is what  I needed. Thank you"
This post gives me hope. Thank you for sharing.
I'm gay aren't I?
"He's only ever had girlfriends but I still have a chance, right?"
"Thank you for saying this. 

Im sorry that he was a jerk; I had something similar happen to me."
"Straight men. Gay men seem to think the average straight guy is the übermensch WHITE masc jock straight man 
 not realizing that that's probably only &lt;15% of straight male population and the rest are just ranging from your average joes to anime girls loving bathwater drinking incels."
Good luck to you and your family! May you all find happiness.
"Lol, you actually believed him? I guess love really does make you crazy."
It’s crazy what the real estate market will make people do!
OP is writing this shit down. I guarantee it.
This really got me emotional. I'm 24 and all alone. But I'm really open to find a guy and have something nice.
Hahahahaha I'm sorry if this was traumatic for you but this shit is internet gold
Or just dump his cheating arse? He sounds like a terrible person. You don't go open to save a relationship.
"Sounds like you definitely need to escape your environment. I left my country for less extreme circumstances than yours.
Look for good jobs in large cities that'll give you proper health benefits so you can be independent and give yourself the happy life you deserve."
"A lot of gay men grow up having forbidden crushes on straight men around them. Personally, I know I fell in love with a straight boy in high school simply because he was nice to me and sometimes treated me like an equal. When you have terrible self-esteem and others have been mean to you, a small act of kindness or basic human decency shown by another person can be very attractive. It took me several years to understand the difference between someone being nice to me and someone being interested in me. 

Based on my personal life experiences, I believe that two people (irrespective of gender/sexual orientation) can share intimacy which need not be sexual. I currently have straight male friends with whom I am very intimate with - we say 'I love you' to each other and mean it. I also have women friends with whom I am intimate with. I do not want a sexual relationship with them because I cherish what I already have. I have learned through experience that it is possible to divert a crush into building deep and meaningful friendships. In modern society, we have made it impossible for two men to share any form of intimacy without raising suspicions about sexuality. I think it is possible and healthy for a gay man to share intimacy with another straight man without it becoming romantic or sexual. Eros is not the only form of love.

Some people believe that straight men are somehow more masculine than gay men. The porn industry capitalizes on this and reinforces stereotypes.

"It’s great having a bf who can also be your guy best friend. Not that straight couples can’t but having another guy I can train at the gym with, play video games with, drink a beer with and then come home and cuddle at the end of the day is pretty damn awesome."
I was walking down the street and a straight guy BREATHED as I walked by him. Does that mean he wants me? Should I abandon my great 10 year relationship for this straight guy?! DEAD
"Wow, that's horrible. I can't even imagine losing a relationship of that length. It's hard for me to understand people who just want to die rich and friendless. Sounds like such a lonely way to live."
No shame on my part.
"he tellin us not to u ding dong, disrespectful"
They’d make that an xtra feature you’d have to pay for
"lol if a dude started flexing while he was fucking me, I think I would start laughing. to each his own, though."
"You're right but also I think OP is warning is all NOT to follow in his footsteps. He isn't one of those LGBTQ that paved the way for us. 

Not that I don't feel sympathy for him. I do. I can't imagine how hard it was to be gay in Poland in the 50s. I'm so sick of LGBTQ hate. It's totally unnecessary."
"With the rise of more and more drug-resistant strains of bacterial STDs, I think you’re dodging bullets with your decision to only play safe. If a guy refuses to play safe, that’s a definite red-flag to me about the quality of the decisions they make and you’re better off filtering them out."
This! Seriously you should be proud of your achievements.
Welcome aboard bro.. dont bother with the labels though just enjoy it
"Tell me what a good boy I am for taking his cock, and lots of kissing"
"Sending my thoughts and prayers, you poor thing"
"Here is your chance to be the big brother you might wish you had growing up! 

Put yourself back into your fifteen year old mind and memory and play out how you would react. This might help to guide your actions with him!"
"Good luck, have fun, and don’t put too much pressure or stock into it :) if it doesn’t work out, don’t beat yourself up"
"It's been over 3 years since I've fooled around. A month ago I was chatting with a guy I found hot as fuck. Like he should be a model. I mentioned condoms to him, and he said he's been on prep for 2 years and has never had an STD. I was still slightly tempted but thought it was best not to meet him. Damnit."
"I feel that. All I want is a relationship or some quality connections. But everyday I get closer to being a... “hoe” because it just seems like everyone wants to hook up and that’s it. I literally have cried because of this turmoil in my head. 

A guy I really like personality and physically - only wants to hook up.
Cute guy that I want to start a convo with - wants dick pic 

It’s frustrating. But I will admit I have found some people that I talk to on the daily that just want to same as me, it’s a great... small community."
"Also the horizontal version of this: his chest pressed against my back pinning me down with full body weight, his legs just outside mine, grinding his dick in as far as it'll go. Bonus points for grabbing both wrists (or otherwise holding my arms down)."
Can't believe it's been 14 years since Brokeback Mountain came out.
"while hes doing me hard while on my back, grab my cock and stroke me at the same time"
"Don't want to pass on as hard on you but let me point you some stuff:

There are red flags all over it. And probably you are better by yourself.

Now you can start thinking about you more, and you can get a dog. The husband can come after. 

You have your own company and maybe you can invest your time in it so you can build yourself from the ground up and be the incredible person you look like you are and your ex missed out.

&amp;#x200B;

I never passed by that kind of separation and I can just imagine what you are feeling... But think one thing. Dogs are amazing beings and they just want love (and food) and they will give you Love and joy (and stuff to clean) in return. I'm sorry for ou and I just know one thing to say:

Go get a DOG, they are amazing. (But don't buy one. Save one from a local shelter, you will find you best friend for sure)"
"""Hey, I'm not mad at you, but it's very difficult to talk to you because we don't share a language"".

Put that into Google Translate."
He went and sat in the sauna for ten minutes before getting you your towel?
"I’ve actually told a few people I’m not interested, they stopped a month or two ago but now with the new Viewed feature on Grindr I can see that they view my profile multiple times a day. I assume either they just really like my profile and/or they’re desperate."
"Lube, foreplay, and when the bottom says leave it in all the way for a second. It is because the anal cavity and sigmoid colon are aligning to make fucking easier. Pound me like you might ripe me in two, but only with that 30 second to 2 minute warm up. That is a personal number others will have their own time frame. I have a weird curve to my insides so cleaning out and starting anal are a pain. But once started you can pound it for hours.

Im vers though."
"Exactly, such a strange question."
"Agreed, he deserves this"
“Ghosting is so immature and people should just be upfront and honest about not being interested”
Please tell me you met Sam in person and that you knew him for more than a month.
"This post could be rewritten as: ""Care enough to make the nature/end of a relationship unambiguous"""
In my opinion it's men wearing panties. It's for some people but it just makes my dick crawl up inside me.
Finish up and stay inside me while cuddling and being affectionate.
"I was raped, and I didn’t tell anyone and it ruined my life. 

Leave out the parts you aren’t happy with and get therapy, NOW. YOU DONT NEED TO TELL YOUR FAMILY, JUST TELL A THERAPIST.

Don’t be like me man. You can recover from this if you deal with it now."
Go  👏out👏 and 👏 get 👏you 👏a👏 man👏 honey. Go. Right now. 👉
"Upvote for ‘affection erections’

Perfectly describes me in the sack lol."
"Sounds like a great first date!

I am 39, too, and went on my first date with a guy just a few months ago and had a great time. I've slowly started coming out and it's been a huge weight lifted off my shoulders, as I'm sure you know. It's nice to finally live honestly.

Hope you have many more awesome dates to follow!"
"She’s a beard, my gaydar is 100%, I just know it!"
“Don't judge people”.
"Go for it.

""Even though we talked about marriage and a future, I'm shy and never did a good job showing him how much he meant to me.""

Tell him that. Goodluck"
"Inclusivity. Or whatever you want to call it. In DC, the Instagram Gays™️ won’t give you the time of day unless you are also an Instagram Gay™️"
I totally get what you mean by watching and trying to get a feel for the do’s and don’t’s of the place before going all in. Congratulations though I’m glad you had a good time!

"You are right, I don't want to give him a third chance and repeat the same mistakes."
"Naw bros, you taking it too seriously. We’re just on there to make friends, is all. We still love you baby.

-Every Grindr user in a relationship ever"
"I know it seems like you're doing the right thing by staying with your wife but I think I don't think that decision is fair to either of you. I don't think doing it for the kids is the right thing either. 

Can you really see yourself being happy seeing guys on the side and then coming home to your wife who you love, but love more as a friend? What's going to happen when you meet a guy you really connect with both sexually and romantically? 

It's going to hurt a lot, for both of you, but it's time to rip the bandaid off and go your seperate ways now rather than using each other as a safety blanket until the situation changes. I can guarantee that the latter is going to cause a whole lot more hurt for one of you then taking action now. You both deserve someone you can settle down with that involves mutual attraction.

""Doing it for the kids"" isn't healthy for them either. Kids aren't dumb, they're going to figure out what's going on and they're going to feel the heavy weight of unhappiness and guilt. They're going to be far better off if their parents are happy, even if that means their parents aren't with each other anymore.

I know it seems like it's going to be hard, but everyone is going to be better off if you make a clean break now and start living your life to its full potential 🙂"
"Yes, at 15 there will be a lot of predators out there looking to take advantage of him. 

Have a good talk to him about being sexually responsible and to try and enjoy being a kid... and not rush into getting into adult problems with adult consequences."
"You’re you face may give you issues with men but wait till your older and you’re going to be so happy you look young. I’ve always looked like an adult,it sucked in HS. Other teens thought I was an undercover policeman."
I will this upcoming week. Thanks for the advice👍
Yes and yes. He quickly became a good friend of mine.
"Recently started topping, I give any bottoms 24 hours notice that I want to hook up, and once I leave my apartment I sent them a Google maps link (location sharing) so they know I'm on my way and exactly when I'll arrive."
"You've clearly have never had an STD 😓
Which is a good thing tbh, but if you ever do you'll know the answer to you question is YES. 
Use a condom, plenty of hot guys, your health is more important. 

Be safe ✌🏽"
"Large dangling balls.  I have had gay friends put stretchers on their balls to make them hang more.  Dudes just wait until you are old and those things hit to toilet water.  Or you are not as mobile and you sit on the damn things.  

Shaved pubic area.  I don't mind trimming but I like men not to look prepubescent.  I am sure I will lose all my karma in down votes on this one."
"I was married and had a kid as well before I came out. Ive been divorced for about 8 years now, and only recently fully accepted that I'm also mostly gay. I went back and forth, but my sexuality is what caused the divorce. My ex wife and I are good friends now, and we co parent our son as a team. It can definitely work out better for the family if you work to make it so. I'm not advocating that you and your wife split, I'm just letting you know there are multiple happy ways forward. While I was actually young when I got married and divorced, I've been there. If you need someone to talk to, hit me up. I'd be glad to talk with you about anything you're worried about."
Dick. Because dick is awesome
True I'll be very careful.
"Oral dom top .....love sucking...  for me, getting my bottom moaning, tensing, whimpering, begging whether from dick sucking, rimming, or fucking are part of what makes it haawwwwtttt!😜"
"My boyfriend doesn't get his period. And no accidental pregnancy.

Downside: No pregnancy at all through conventional means..."
"&gt;What do you guys think

I think it's cute.

&gt;do you agree?

I always agree with cute."
You probably found your prostate my guy xD enjoy
"You should be careful! I would never agree to meet a catfish. Theres been people that make fake accounts, fake their gps location and meet up the victim and rob them! Happened to a friend of mine."
"Yes, I too enjoy visually experiencing the buttocks of humans to whom I am sexually attracted."
A documentation of the birth of a bottom
beware lest you fall in love with someone who doesn't love you. that warmth could very well burn you.
"Ghosting is garbage. I learned the hard way by being subjected to it that it’s better just to express that you’ve lost interest. As a lesson to all gay men: if there isn’t anything there and it fizzles out on both ends, that’s one thing. But if it’s someone you showed interest in at one point and you’ve grown to not care anymore, at least give them the respect they deserve and tell them you don’t feel that way anymore. It will sting for a little bit but it can sting much longer it be downright destructive if it’s left ambiguous with no explanation."
"Well first of all, breathe and get a glass of water. The most important thing is that you still love him and care about him, right? You want what’s best for him? Clearly you do bc you took his advice about coming to this thread.

Look, there are no guarantees that any of us anywhere are gonna be safe from harm no mater gay, straight, bisexual, any of it. But, you have some degree of faith that you raised him to be a good human being, to brush his teeth and pay his taxes and be a functional member of society, right? Having a gay son isn’t all THAT different from a straight one, he’s not gonna start walking on the ceiling or having broccoli crawl out of his ears. 

I’m not sure where “here” is for you, but it seems some discretion is advisable regarding the local government and family members. That’s manageable - the most important and best thing you can do for your son is to hug him tight, look him in the eye and say, “You are my son and I love you.”

The rest of it - where he’ll go, what he’ll do, you can figure that out later. You haven’t failed as a father, this isn’t the result of choices made or not made. This is who he is and if he trusted you enough to tell you, and you love him regardless, well that’s a really good place to start."
What the fuck did I just read
Make sure someone isn't catfishing while using their photo's as bait though. I've seen it happen.
Oh wow lol. At that point you’re just friends 😂🤷‍♂️
"I'm the same age, and relatively successful, but I'm like ""daaaaaaamn"" to both of these guys' success. Anyway, I'm sure OP will find a guy who appreciates him -- all of him, not just his career potential -- but unless the ex clones himself he'll never find someone who meets his ridiculous standards."
"Nah I couldn't care less, personally. There's even three other people in my apartment building on it. We nod hello in the lifts.

At the end of the day, it's proximity based; that means there's a high chance of running into gridsters from time to time."
Jaming your tongue all the way into my mouth the moment our lips touch is not hot.
"See I've heard conflicting things about how long tops should last. After twenty minutes or so, things start to get uncomfortable for me. I like a guy who lasts like ten minutes, it's the perfect amount of time. Getting fucked for hours doesn't sound nice imo."
"I feel like this has to do largely with the Queer community going through a bit of a revolution at the moment. As more visibility is given to Trans and non binary issues, there's a reactionary phase where people are going to have to expand their understanding/acceptance and I don't think we're quite at the expansion stage of it all, yet."
Ok just checking. There have been a ton of “I got ghosted” from guys who met some dude on Grindr and were chatting with them for three weeks and then the guy disappeared.
"You were molested.

It wasn’t your fault.

Your mother’s reaction was to blame the victim.

You didn’t break your family because it already was.

I’m deeply sorry you went through all of this."
"Wait, you can see that someone has viewed your profile on Grindr?"
Play dumb and ask them to be more specific.
"You've pretty much hit the nail on the head.

At least if you're being ghosted you have peace and quiet because they're ignoring you.  Sending someone a barrage of messages screaming for attention is irritating and such a turn-off."
"Hey I've been that guy.


Feelsgoodman."
This is literally Chappy App from what you described.
Inclusion.
"Looool, love the creativity"
"I really dislike tops that don't suck cock. Why should you be the only one to get off. No thank you. When I R. S. V. P to a party, I make it my business to cum. 
To me it's greedy. You get your dick sucked, and to fuck me, but you don't want to return the favor. What kind of shit is that?"
"Your situation is not uncommon among LGBTQ people your age even in places like the US, and it's not your fault. You were born in a very difficult time in a difficult place.

[LGBTQ senior/elder care](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/lgbtq-seniors-face-discrimination-long-term-care) is one of my pet causes because it's still basically non-existent, and OP's situation is frighteningly common.

Particularly the generation that grew up when more often coming out would mean you lost your biological family, decades before marriage and adoption were legal, and that was decimated by the worst of HIV/AIDS.

Many are left without family and decreasingly fewer connections to friends and other means of support. Loneliness and isolation are very serious issues--let alone the financial and practical needs that come with aging.

The community has largely not taken this issue on. I feel like if you ask LGTBQ people what the top 5 priorities the community should be working on most would not think of caring for the older members of our community. I think it should absolutely be one of the top things we talk about and work to address.

Zhran, just by surviving and being here today you've done more for future generations than you know. The fact that in this difficult time of your life you are concerned about the well-being of others shows that you are a thoughtful and generous person."
"Unless they can find a kindly benefactor to care for them in their old age, they are melted down and made into glue."
"It's because this sub is heavily populated by young gays, and gays who are either questioning or closeted. Many gay dudes begin their love affair with the male form via crushes on straight men. Most gays eventually break away from that and recognize that loud and proud gay guys have a lot to offer in terms of being actual relationship material, etc. Unfortunately, this sub becomes the dumping ground for a lot of fantasizing, fictional stories and fetishizing of straight men because of it."
My husband wasn't even out until his late twenties. You have time.
I'll have what he's having ☝️
"Why would anyone downvote you? That's basically beautiful. 

This is not meant to be dark, but when I went through an awful breakup, and found out my ex was living a secret life while we lived together (together for almost 7 years) the biggest thing I learned. 


Learn to be happy alone. Because then, someone may come along, and they cannot complete you. Because you are complete. And you're fucking awesome. And someone who deserves you will add to how fucking awesome you already are. Love yourself a little bit more than anyone could ever love you. You deserve it."
I mean I honestly don’t know why you’re even still with him after he cheated “a few times” and why is he making friends on tinder? I would dump his loser ass.
"This is what I went with. At first he said, ""but that's the least I understand what it says a little bit but I understand"". I told him I knew he understood me but I don't understand him. He said ok and good luck with everything and that was that.

Thanks for everyone's help. 

Thanks for everyone's help!"
"Knew a guy once who told me that his last *six* boyfriends had cheated on him. Six! And he was zero tolerance and would break up immediately. He was ever so sad and lonely though. I think he could probably have used time with them exploring exactly what had happened and it's motivation, so he could understand the situation a little better."
Work with me. Let me know what you’re feeling. Moan. Say my name. Talk to me. Gyrate. Hold on to me. Cum while I’m deep inside. Kiss me a lot. Let me cuddle you after. Fall asleep in my arms.
I’m on Grindr and I have no idea what the hell I’m looking for.
Why didn't you flirt back though??
Just like Otis and Eric from Sex Education. I love this!
"&gt;I don't hate myself anymore, I'm proud of myself. I finally got to experience this feeling that was a mystery for me when I used to be conflicted. Today was a very important day of my life and I will never forget it!

That is so wonderful to hear, I am extremely happy for you"
that’s easy to say but the truth is the pool of guys wanting to fuck and guys wanting relationships are not balanced at all
"For me, I'd add

-Don't waste time trying to live up to your parents' expectations.  Be your own person and if your parents cannot respect that, that's their problem.  I lost the entire second half of my twenties due to this and the first half of my thirties.

-Move away from your hometown.  The best three years of my adulthood was when I moved away from home after college.  I let my family guilt me into returning home and it's been miserable.  Living here, I find it hard to distance myself from the person I was at 15 and I absolutely detest that person."
"Calling your ass your ""man pussy""!

:CRINGE"""
He's not even worth a Grindr message. Break up with him via tap.
"Fliippppp ffuuuccckkkkk (for verse guys at least). Also rim me foreeevveerrr. Rimming is sometimes just as nice as sex and the longer a guy rims me, the more I like getting fucked after."
"Personal storytime!

When I began dating my boyfriend, he had a cocaine problem. He was my boss and we'd go out drinking, he'd make shit happen and occasionally I would diffuse the situation. Back then, I never thought I'd be dating him.

I resigned -- for unrelated reasons -- but here in Brazil you normally have to work for another month before you can actually quit so that you don't jeopardize the company's operations.

Two weeks into my last month, we went out to a club and he jumped on me and we have a great night together, soon after we were dating. That has amounted to one and a half year.

Once, he downloaded Grindr on his own, I asked him why he was online, and he said it was because he was horny and wanted to talk dirty. That was back when he still had a coke problem. He's stopped smoking and doing coke since then.

Last week was my city's pride. We took ecstasy together there, and we were so insane we left at 2 p.m. to try and sleep it off. He slept it off, I downloaded Grindr and I hit on pretty much any pretty available guy that was there. At one point, I was one step away from actually cheating. But I didn't. I told him everything.

My point?

1. He's done with coke, so we both should probably be done with ecstasy;

2. It's not all black and white, I forgave him and he forgave me, and as far as I know, neither of us cheated;

3. This **shouldn't** happen. We understand it now.

So while I do agree with OP, I think it's not written in stone. It depends on the context. Did you find him on Grindr without him saying anything to you, with a description, a face picture, and everything? Was he just cruising to get his rocks off? Has this been discussed? Has been under the influence? Take it easy, sometimes a break-up just isn't necessary, but sometimes it's overdue. Life is full of grays."
This is your best friend and he’s emotionally vulnerable right now. I vote no. Cuddle him. Be supportive. And if that leads to something or sex down the road. That’s cool. But he’s in mourning and you shouldn’t fuck your best friend while he’s mourning. Just too vulnerable.

"I see some great replies stacked with other, less great, ones in the same comments, so I'll just grab the two I agreed with but didn't want to upvote because of the other stuff.    
    
**Photos with Filters** - Especially that dog filter, but also ALL other Snapchat filters that changes or modifies your face. It annoys me because I can't see your actual face, and saddens me because it lets me know how insecure you are about your looks.    
    
**Drug / Alcohol use** - I mean, I love my whiskey, and my ADHD brain would barely function if I didn't have my Adderall - But flaunting drug and alcohol use like you're competing with early 2000s Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan isn't sexy, and neither is dealing with your drunk ass, or having to raise my voice because you try to insist I ""Have another one"", because you need me drunk so you have the upper hand, in order to feel comfortable."
"Nobody will have the same opinion, obviously, so it's more a personnal thing.

On apps : Duckfaces and Dog filters. Is there ANYONE in the world who has been ever attracted to this? Posing like a model won't help either. Proudly showing your biceps will make you look dumb. 

In reality: a guy thinking itself as a art object (stylish clothes, stylish haircut, stylish mustache). Good for museum but not to feel anything... And guys with absolutely 0000% fat : seeing your veins and every single little muscle tensed like it will explode is not sexy, it's scary."
Being sexually attracted to men rather than women makes you gay.
I said his generation not him
"I will ask those questions sometimes because I'm on antidepressants and it takes me forever to cum, so I don't want the top to feel like he has to wait on me to finish.

Also, if the top is taking a while to finish, it can get uncomfortable down there.

You just need to find a bottom who likes long sessions, because they aren't for everyone."
What area is that?
This is gonna be EPIC. DO IT OP! He's a scum. Or maybe just leave it to Karma. What goes around comes around. You deserve so much better than him!

"Lol. It would be funny, yes. But I ask my fit tops to do it for me. It kinda makes them more sexy for me. I’m really attracted to guys with big arms and chest, that’s why."

Instagram is a disease.
something tells me that your ex fiancee is probably going to regret for the rest of his life what he had lost by breaking up with you once he feels satisfied with his career. Hopefully you won't cave in when/if that day comes.
"Look, failing to disclose to someone risking exposure to a life-threatening, communicable illness that *you have that illness* is a criminal offense in all but 12 states. In 19 states, you are required by law to disclose a positive HIV status, even undetectable, to a sexual partner. In 26 states, if you fail to disclose and your sexual partner contracts the disease, you can be sentenced up to *life* in prison, regardless of whether the transmission occurred through deliberate unprotected sexual penetration.

This isn't about *your* feelings, or about avoiding stigma, or about *your* privacy. It is about the right of *anyone,* including you, to know ahead of time if a sexual partner comes with certain risks, and the right to decide whether to proceed given that risk.

110% agree that more information about undetectable HIV needs to be distributed. 110% agree that the risk, as far as we know, is small if even relevant.

But there is *no such thing* as a ""100% risk-free encounter"" when it comes to sticking someone's body into your body, or vice versa, or sticking things that were in their body in your body, or vice versa. You can slap 18 condoms on a dick, pour a 5 gallon drum of spermicide into your ass, or line your esophagus with latex, and the only thing you've done is *minimized the risk of exposure*. You have *not* eliminated it.

So, let's stop with these mind-games. Feelings, social justice, and ""there's no documented instance"" are not defenses to reckless behavior. Disclose your status. Offer to answer any questions. Try to handle rejection with tact, and if the rejection is delivered without tact, teach them to respect you.

And I'm truly sorry I can't make the world any less ignorant than what you're likely to deal with. I know it sucks. I wish as much as you could that this wasn't how things are, that people took the extra two minutes to be informed before treating you like you need to be quarantined from the world. I'm HIV-. Would I marry someone who's HIV+? Yes. Would their status be a factor in my willingness to date them? No. Why? Because, as weird as this might sound to some people, I'd rather have a *good* life than a long one, and if the trade-off to an amazing relationship is living with HIV, that doesn't sound like a bad deal to me. Will it sound like a bad deal to someone else? Yes. What can we do? Nothin'. There are things in life you can wiggle a little here and there to improve, but for a lot of them it is what it is. 

Don't get wrapped up in fantasies about things being something they're not. I know this is the big ""post modern construct"" phase, but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, illness is not a social construct, we can't protest the universe for being unfair and inequitable. Try to build more sustainable communities. At this rate, the first person who can find a way to get us all off Grindr, Scruff, and Tinder, and actually in a room together, meeting face to face, like healthy interpersonal relationships usually start, will have a huge lead on reducing para-social ignorance."

Young people are growing less tolerant of LGBTQ individuals, a jarring turn for a generation traditionally considered embracing and open, a survey released Monday shows.

The number of Americans 18 to 34 who are comfortable interacting with LGBTQ people slipped from 53% in 2017 to 45% in 2018 – the only age group to show a decline, according to the annual [Accelerating Acceptance report](https://www.glaad.org/publications/accelerating-acceptance-2019). And that is down from 63% in 2016.

Driving the dilution of acceptance are young women whose overall comfort levels plunged from 64% in 2017 to 52% in 2018, says the survey conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of [LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD](https://www.glaad.org/).

"Are you me?! 

But in all seriousness, I just want someone who wants to be with me just as much as I want to be with them, and not lose interest after a few more."
"You're just doing it backwards.

Grinder is like going shopping for avocados. You really need to smell and squeeze the merchandise before you decide if you have enough money to pay at the register."
"I can not imagine how difficult that was, I'm so sorry. It sounds like you really need to cut them both out of your life."
"I don’t understand your question?! What other interpretation could there be to this situation?! Of course he wants you! Why are we even talking about what his face gay you’ve been kill time with,?! A straight guy breathed in your general direction. That’s yours girl go out and get it!"
"This. Asking people to elaborate on an incredibly stupid question is the best tactic to shut them down, especially because in order to support it they'll usually say even more impressive bullshit that'll be harder to argue against individually.

Conceding that ""you know what I mean"" so easily was a mistake, because it comes with so much fallacious baggage that, as you saw, explaining why it's flawed at that point will sound like ""blah blah"" to them."

Worst thing would be he freaks out and murders me."

A little possessive of his best friend / kinda annoyed by his eventual girlfriend 

Heavily dislikes things that could be seen as girly

When any lgbt topics come up, will try to change topics 

Very coy about descriptions of what type of person they like. Descriptions are carefully worded to be as gender neutral as possible. Will use girl descriptors now and then to throw people off."
and i want a boyfriend that who can fuck my brains out and call me a dirty slut every time i take his massive cock
This is one of the things I've noticed parents do when they already suspect that you're gay.
"PreP just protects you against HIV, not all STIs/STDs. Wear a condom."
You're not outing him as gay.  You're outing him as a rapist.
"I already do, and do they have a filter option but it still shows guys that want to hookup but have ""dates"" and ""right now"""
"Achieving financial independence and security is... really one of the most important things any young person can do. But in the case of any LGBT persons in a hostile or potentially hostile environment, it is especially important. It sucks but that's just how it is, it is better to be in the closet than it is to be homeless, and I say that from having experience with homelessness (although it was unrelated to being LGBT).

I had a somewhat similar experience, growing up in a religious family and homophobic community, afraid of being cast out because the people I fall in love with happen to also have Y chromosomes and dicks. I eventually did come out to family, but I didn't do it until after I was in a position where my financial savings and career meant that even if everyone in my life rejected me, I would be okay. I was fortunate in that my parents still accepted me, but a lot of queer people aren't accepted by family when they come out. And without a backup plan that can lead to some very bad situations. Again, it's terrible and totally unfair, but no one gets to choose who they're born as or where they're born, it's just something you have to work around.

So I would advise you to keep working, save money, and start looking into financial planning and better career opportunities, which could include going to school. Going to college/university is it's own bag of worms: perhaps you already realize this but the whole schtick about going to college to ""discover yourself"" is total bullshit and a waste of time and money. Education is a financially expensive investment in many countries, and investments are meant to pay off, so actually look into what kind of career you are interested in, what it will take to get into it, and if it will allow you to live a life you want both in a fiscal sense and as a gay man. I really cannot express how important it is to consider the costs of everything and learn how to budget, how to earn money, and how to save. Looking at subreddits like /r/personalfinance and similar resources is probably more important to you right now than looking at this one. You need security of your person, which could mean moving away, even to a different country, and will certainly mean that you'll need money. Don't do anything rash like coming out publicly and hoping for the best, make a plan to create financial security and career opportunities that will allow you to live the life you want even if you get cut off from your current social network of family and the church.

And there is nothing wrong with being a virgin. I never had a sexual relationship until I was 24, not even a kiss, and when I did it was with someone I deeply loved and who respected me. It was pretty great and unlike a lot of people's first times, I didn't find it awkward at all. And even though our romantic relationship didn't work out long-term, we are still close friends today. So, being a virgin isn't bad, love is a thing that can happen for gays, having sex with people you feel safe with and who respect you is great, and also there are plenty of resources you can google about how to have safe sex and also how to actually have sex (I read up a lot on how to give head before doing it: first time was really fun for me and my lover, and they got tested for STIs and shared their results with me before our relationship got physical) and learning both beforehand and putting it into practice can give you peace of mind and a bit of confidence.

And good job on making it this far in life. Surviving life is already difficult, even without things like having to live in the closet because there are people around you who would hate you because of your love. And you're still holding onto that and want to share it with others. It might not feel like a lot, but it's an impressive accomplishment."
"I know you don't think so, but this is incredibly sweet. 

You guys are figuring it out together. You're just learning. Research a little online so you get the basics but in real life boners disappear even under the best of circumstances, condoms break, you buy the wrong enema, you're interrupted, someone's gonna fart, someone is going to say something incredibly ridiculous that will kill the mood  - this is how it goes. Sounds like you have a boyfriend who wants to help you guys figure it out together. It'll happen. Learn what each other likes - sex takes practice. I don't know of one person who's first time was ""magical"" - most of the time it's a nightmare, and then something to laugh about.   And by all means - relax and go with it. I'm sure you two will have some great times ahead. Best of luck!"

"I can empathize with what you're going through. My ex left me because he felt that we were ""following 2 different paths"". The fact that he was finally earning more money than me is pure coincidence, I'm sure. 

It sounds to me that you've realised what is important in life.  Nobody on their deathbed ever said ""I wish I'd spent more time at work""

For me the first phase of the breakup was mourning the end of the relationship and mourning the future I'd imagined.  

Sadly I don't have much advise to give.  5 years on I'm still struggling with my situation. Mostly just disappointed with myself for having married the wrong person, and I say ""the wrong person"" because taking a few steps back and analysing the situation I can see how shallow and selfish a person he is.  I don't blame him; he is who he is. I'm the one who chose to stay for so long. 

 My biggest challenge is to not think of our 10 years together as wasted time. 

So all that being said, what has helped me is (1) therapy and (2) a whole lot of Brené Brown (I'm currently watching an interview she did with Russel Brand on YouTube). 

The trick is to be happy with who you are and the choices you've made: you are 100% in the right to want to slow down and find meaning in your life and connection with other people.  This is who you are and this is what is important to you.  Don't change for someone else. 

It's tough going it alone but so much more rewarding that trying to be someone you're not."
"Straight men don't wipe good.

"Yes, you lucky man"
"Yup, and I regret not coming out sooner because I feel like I lived a fake life up to this point."
"If I would have been born straight I probably would still be stuck in my religious cult family and still be depressed about all the people going to Hell. Being ""afflicted"" with homosexuality was the best thing that could have happened to me to get me out of that situation."
"Yeah, I don’t know if everywhere has it but when I go on taps it says how many people have viewed you in the last 24 hours. Without the memeber#hip though you have the 5 most recent, 1 being clear with the name and the other 4 being blurred out but since I’m not in a highly populated area you can tell who 95% of the people are."
"100%

"Most straight dudes are literally STARVED for male affection. A lot of the time it isn’t even that they’re gay, they just can’t embrace or be cute with each other at all because “that shits gay”.  
It bubbles up under the surface until they’re 50, paying for male escorts to cuddle for 3 hours. 

But trust your gut, if he’s really into you but can’t say it, it’s on you to interpret. Everyone loves a brokeback fantasy!"
"I personally don't enjoy sucking dick, but I just wanted to comment and say that I think it's great for guys to challenge this silly idea that being top or bottom somehow dictates your attitude towards or pleasure from oral sex. Met plenty of bottoms that hate sucking dick, tops that love sucking dick, and vice versa. 

Hell, I've met dominant bottoms and submissive tops. Just do you!"
"Wow amazing step for you. 

Don't set too much expectations, just know that doing this has made you a better person. Proud of you bud."
"It’s not enough. 

The lust for straight guys is wanting something you can’t have. It’s merely trying to fulfill a fantasy. That’s why things like gay for pay porn is so popular."
"In my free time I like to cycle or play golf on a sunny day. I often like to swap dick pictures with strangers on grindr as well.. Yes, I have many hobbies.."
"Bad sex:

He was watching TV when I arrived and gave me nearly zero eye contact. I sat on the couch and watched him watch TV for a while then I asked him if we were going to hookup or not. He just pointed to his bedroom. We undressed and he was an actual 9"" and wanted me to bottom. I was pretty inexperienced at that time even though I was in my 30's and he was in his mid-twenties. He began to fuck me and it was extremely uncomfortable. Just before I was ready to vomit. I asked him to stop. He did but was pissed about it. I left. Later, I found out I caught crabs from him. 

Awesome sex, but overall bad experience. I've posted this a few times but here goes:

I met the same guy three times. First, we met at a park and blew each other in the bushes on a hot summer night. Next, I picked him up from a store parking lot and took him to my place. I took his virginity. Seeing his eyes roll up until I could only see white and hearing him moan as I fucked him was one of the hottest sights I've ever seen. On our third ""date,"" I took him out to dinner and paid for him to see a movie with me. We went back to my place because he was supposed to spend the night. He asked if he could tie me up for sexual fun. It's not my thing but I agreed. He tied me to the bed with a blindfold. He spent the next hour alternating between kissing me and sucking me off. He kept talking about how anxious he felt. He then told me to lift my blindfold, which I was just able to reach. He held a gun in my face and said ""This is a robbery. Pull the blindfold down. You're too trusting so I have to teach you a lesson. I really like you so don't do anything stupid. Be absolutely still.""

He then proceeded to load my car up with anything of value I had, my laptop, my smartphones, parts I had just purchased to make a computer for the Oculus Rift I expected to buy. He complained that I had so little of value. I told him he should have robbed someone rich. Before he left he offered me a drink of water and put socks on my feet since I complained of being cold. He then asked me if I was mad. I said, ""No, just sad, because I really liked you."" He stole my car and eventually I worked my way free and untied myself. I used my old desktop with Google voice to call the police. When they arrived, I merely told them I had discovered my car missing that morning.

Three months later he emailed me. He said he was very sorry and that if I could ever forgive him, he wanted to see me again. He said he liked how I talked to him. I told him if he paid me $2000 to cover my expenses, I would forgive him. He didn't respond."
Told me he voted for Trump
99% of the 💎guys on my Grindr grid. Hopeless chancers looking for a free ride at life.
I think your respond was perfect. I would've done it the same way! I don't think that people who ask such questions need more of an elaborated answer. Great job!
I’m almost in the same situation. Move on!
Fuck yes! Awful look.
Just be mindful of the fact that your bottom is literally letting you put one of your body parts inside his ass.....I’m always shocked by tops that seem to have no concept of what can and should be done to make the experience comfortable and enjoyable for bottoms. Take a few mins and think about how you’d want a guy to approach shoving himself inside your asshole if the roles were reversed and go from there.
The whole birther conspiracy didn't tip you off? Haha.
I had 2 experiences like yours. Except I turned around at the door. Never had the sex.
"Tbh it’s never good enough for anyone. Like, my family will constantly point if I’ve gained weight. Once I’ve lost it, they said my face looked bad, too skinny. You can’t please ANYONE but yourself. If you’re happy and healthy, fuck the other buffoons."
You've somehow missed what he's best known for before this movie came out. He's arguably the most significant father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. His concepts and theories are still being taught in universities worldwide. His work is truly brilliant and was a big part of my cognitive science program just a few years ago.
There are gay men that do this too.

"Sudden drop in blood pressure from relaxing all of the muscles you tensed leading up to and during orgasm. This is part of what edging does, too. You get so tense while prolonging the orgasm that by the time you finally bust, it's a body-wide release of muscles held taut, which feels amazing in itself, but also hits you with a head rush as the blood flows back into your muscles, dropping your blood pressure."
"I was 29.  I had one serious relationship end two years earlier.  I had to pay a mortgage and look after our dog by myself.  So I put my head down and worked hard.  I quit smoking, started exercising.  I got promoted at work and moved to night-shift hours so I could study during the day.  I set up this awesome routine of going for a run with the dog everyday and using my down time productively .  It was bliss.  Perfect.  I didn’t want anything to change.  Then I went to Sydney for the weekend with my dad and brother to watch an AFL match.  Met my soon to be parter, quit work, transferred schools, my-ex asked for the pup to move in with him, and I moved to Sydney eight weeks later.

We broke up after 10 good years.  So I decided I’d be single for at least two years or so.  I wanted to get my head right and make sure I learnt the lessons of the relationship.  I went out to a gay club two months after the breakup and met this cute guy.  Instant chemistry but told him my situation.  He said that was understandable.  We fucked.  It was great.  I wanted to see him again.  We saw each other every second weekend. I deliberately didn’t see him consecutive weekends.  I loved our time together but was really scared it was too soon and I’d have unprocessed baggage from my previous relationship.  Suddenly we’ve been seeing each other for a year.  Friends and family have met but we’ve always been just “mates”.  I decided to see a psychologist because I’m 40 soon and I’d been through a bit lately and it was a great chance for a mental tune-up.  After a few sessions I mention Jon.  The psych says I’m crazy not to dive in and that it’s clearly the kind of love that comes once or twice in your life.  So I tell Jon I love him.  I’ve known for a while he loves me.  I apologised for making him wait so long but he said he didn’t care.  He’s laying next to me in bed now."

"If you're single and welcome attention it's great.

If you're in a relationship and don't want any romantic or sexual attention it just causes drama. For every person who sees you're very happily in a couple and backs away there are 2 people who consider it some challenge to get in the middle of us. Worse still some people think they're entitled to your attention maybe because they think they deserve you more, OR because they think 2 attractive guys don't deserve each other and one of us should give someone ""less blessed"" a ""chance"". 

This is exponentially more true because we're two guys - both other gay guys AND straight women seem to think it's OK to make inappropriate advances because they just can't believe you're not with them by some entitled delusion in their head."

But this dude sounds like an absolute jerk. Making 40K a year age 25 is really great even not considering how bad economies are across the world.  

Also, it doesn’t matter if you make 40K, 400K or 40M a year - if he really felt a connection, or even cared about you, he wouldn’t have said something as crappy as that.  

My advice? Move on with it. Don’t let this awful experience define your time with other guys.  There are plenty of guys out there who will love you for who you are, no matter the money rolling into your bank.

"Try a new haircut, start working out, try dressing more adult. Maybe make a joke about how young you look on your profiles. I think confidence is sexy and owning what you have will attract more guys. But honestly I wouldn't worry about it! Keep blocking the pedos lol Maybe reconsider the facial hair. Also keep getting older 😊 You're a handsome guy so this won't be a problem for long."
"&gt;I don’t want to force him to come out to me if he isn’t ready yet.

It's not about that any more. It's not about his comfort. It's about his safety, and also about him potentially breaking the law, and maybe getting some guy into a lot of trouble or ruining his life. This is serious. Of course you talk to him. Ideally you should also tell your parents."
"&gt; When you have terrible self-esteem and others have been mean to you, a small act of kindness or basic human decency shown by another person can be very attractive.

Oh god, this is the worst for your mind when you're gay and have no idea. I formed a good relationship with a girl, we were super honest and connected with each other, and I thought I was in love with her. I finally said so, and turned out, she wasn't feeling that, and I soon realized, that wasn't the correct situation. It made things awkward and we let our relationship slip as she went to college. We reconnected briefly after I came out and I met her husband. Oddly or appropriately enough, they were doing lighting for a local production of Rent and got me a free ticket.

So, yeah, when you have years of people treating you like shit, when you meet the people who don't (who often were treated just the same), it's extremely confusing as to how you're supposed to treat that."
Looked through your post history to see the first awkward encounter . . . that was a mistake.
"Most of the time the homophobia is casual banter so I can clap about something about fucking their father and then they'll either tone it down or it'll be our rapport.

Some tops don’t like sucking dick and even some bottoms don’t like their tops to suck dick. It’s weird tbh.
"Your attraction stems from the fact that there is a guy taking care of another living thing other than themselves. You relate to them owning a dog as them being responsible,  and having the skills necessary to care for others.

"As a deeply cynical and pragmatic human, I would suggest that you get a lawyer and consider suing your ex for the assets that you are entitled to. I don’t know what state you live in, but this sounds like the end of a common-law marriage to me and not just a “break-up.” As such, the things you are talking about should be considered community property. If you ex doesn’t want to do the decent thing and give you the settlement you’re entitled to, take him to court. I understand it’s not about the money or stuff. I understand you’re hurting. But there is no reason that he should be allowed to blow up your life together and then continue living in the home you sacrificed for without you in it. If he wants to keep it all, he needs to leverage his “success” (which he prioritized over you) and pay you for it."
"Just be upfront that you think he's a great guy, but you don't want a relationship. Say that if he's cool with that then you can keep talking, but if he wants to be more, then he should stop talking to you because you don't want to lead him on."
"Eh, there's a difference between caring about a relationship and caring about a person. It's not hard to just be like ""Hey, sorry, it hasn't been working out, we should really move on"". Yea it might be hard to say, which is why I think it has more to do with being cowardly and just avoiding problems"
Yes agreed. I love a top who somehow shows his strength and fitness but also interest in me
"You’ll get it eventually. I woulda dated that dude but he was only passing through town. Thankfully I got to see him when he came through town a few more times, and those hook ups were equally fun. Haven’t met a guy quite like him though since"
Please himself.
You keep your nose out of this. Let them work on their own relationship.
The only thing in that photo I'm desperate to change is your haircut. It's a bit bowl-shaped. Which is very good since that's fixable.
You’ll be thankful later it has its perks
LOL
This is my thing. I may as well get my head removed and put back on backwards I spend so much time looking over my shoulder. I've got off buses before my stop. I also like watching straight men do the same to women. You would me amazed by how many straight men *don't* look though.
"On a scale of I passed gas really loudly to I am watching gay porn on my phone in church  but forgot to turn my Bluetooth headphones on, how awkward is a boner in an army shower 😬"
Condoms.
Posts like this are so ridiculous.
"Cab driver midway through a mostly silent ride, staring at me in rear view mirror: “handsome boy, but too fat”.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"The issue is the method though, it takes 2 seconds and minimal effort to text ""Sorry not interested"". Sure it sucks to get rejected but at the least there is a sense of closure and that person is not left endelessely speculating about what exactly happened.  And if you've been intimate with someone you at the very least owe them to not be a coward in the face of something mildly uncomfortable."
You gotta learn to love and accept yourself first before you can ask that of another person
I'd feel lucky to date someone hot enough for someone to use their photos for catfishing
"You are right, I feel the joke is on me. May be I should go back on Prep, use condoms and announce to him to be Open."
"Im a top, but I've tried and agree with others that say, ""try bottoming"". Nothing is better than first hand experience."
"That’s fair to ask. This was a short friendship, but it lasted longer than a month."
"ATM - ass to mouth
ain't no dick gon' go from my ass to my mouth"
"Well, as a gay man myself. I do not identify as lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or asexual.

So... yup. Just gay.

Are the others part of my community? Absolutely.
Just because I do not identify as anything other than a gay cis male, doesn't mean I can't understand their struggles. Or, celebrate their victories.
And if you can keep up with my horrific dance moves and try not to laugh, I will dance with anyone under the disco ball."
"Love that - picturing you in a lab coat with a lil notebook drinking your Coronas going ""hmmmm interesting."" 🤔🌈"
They become middle school music teachers who wear argyle sweaters
Post the links so we can evaluate the depth of his betrayal.
"I can’t even begin to imagine your loss. My husband is my lover, my best friend, my favorite person in the entire world. I don’t know what I would do if I went through what you have suffered. I’m so sorry and I hope that someday it will be easier."
"The is part of the reason I ended up getting off of grindr for the meantime. The way guys communicate on that app is just not acceptable to me. I wasn't getting anywhere talking to guys on there like I would talk to a normal person. It was all 'pics, hung?, into?, now?'. Then if a conversation did lead to making plans they'd ghost. Disheartening and frustrating."
For real lmao. This is all I ask for at this point 😩
"Thanks for you concern. I was very aware of the possibilities of something really bad might have happened, so the place I chose was pretty safe, plus I also had some of the dorm friends know what were going on so that they would take action if things went wrong. About this particular catfish, well he was just a guy in early 30s who was desperately horny and wanted some young college dudes to give him head."
Flip fuck.
"OP, you should definitely follow this advice."
I know. Every time I see posts like this or I make a similar post on getting a general consensus on what guys want...I remember it lol. While point of the post so you can be a better lover.
"I'm versatille at the end of the day, if it were up to me, my idea sexual encounter is me sucking dick, deepthroating, a nice long rimming then fucking the guy. oh and add in some foot worship since that's my fetish. so, yeah, even when i top i suck the other guy off."
"He did a very brave thing, so I’d be proud of him for doing something scary. Tell him it doesn’t change any of the important stuff, just the gender of who you’re going to talk about when he’s into someone. My guess is that he doesn’t want to feel special or different right now, but like he’s still you’re bro and that you’re always there."
Just more proof that gay men aren't any different from everyone else. They can be ignorant just like the rest of the maga crowd.
Dirty. Talk.
"Also it’s not about being open, he clearly doesn’t respect OP enough to have that conversation. Instead he found it easier/more convenient to lie to OP and make up this crazy story. Get out of there."
"As a guy who lives in a smaller rural area I encounter married men who are gay and still married to a woman. Yes I have hooked up with many , I had an affair with my married neighbor for yrs . I know it’s painful for your wife but this is just going to eat her up. Every time you go out and if your with some , she may say she’s ok with it but I can assure you it will eat her up like cancer. It’s not fair to either of you to stay around “just for the kids” etc. I know she’s built her life around you and what you have achieved all your marriage. But it’s like poisoning the well. If you repress your true self and being gay , that will eat you up and if you stay it’s going to erode and make things worse in the long term. I do think the best thing you can do is separate or divorce and both of you can heal and find new ways . It’s unfortunate but I really don’t see a way out without damage to both of you , but in the long run it’s better for both of you . It’s going to kill her thinking you’re out with not only another person but a man as well. I hope you can find the right way out and minimize as much damage as you can . Good luck and God Bless"
