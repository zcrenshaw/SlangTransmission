Piers Morgan. He’s a professional outrage machine and knows exactly what he’s doing. 
"I started working at this office full of ""we're mad, we are"" types, and the banter du jour mainly revolved around how this one bloke, Dave, had once toasted and buttered a crumpet and then accidently left it on the worktop before going back to his desk. Every fucking time he left his workstation, Helen the office manager would say ""oi, Dave, don't forget your crumpets this time"" and would then proceed to shriek with laughter like a banshee. Any time he was sat at his desk eating a crumpet someone would walk past and say ""well done Dave, you remembered not to leave it on the worktop today, hahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHA**HAHAHA**"".

I don't know how long ago the initial incident had happened, but I worked there for three months and they were still making crumpet jokes on the day I left, so it could have been years ago for all I know."
Ops mum
"I'm sure K. Hopkins is sat flicking her bean at the prospect of romping away with this one but she's not much more than a panto act, right down to the make-up. By ruling out political figures this is hard, so how about Philip Green? Our very own Donald. A shit-list as long as your arm, more so if you're a t-rex."
"I suggest ""Dr"" Andrew Wakefield.

The paper he published suggesting a link between vaccines and autism was deeply (illegally) flawed and I forget the details but it was done in such a way that he financially benefited from his ""research"" - was he pushing separate vaccines or something? He was struck off the register here so went to the States, continued to call himself a doctor and continued to fuel this lie, not an opinion, a LIE he consciously told for his own financial benefit and is personally responsible for hundreds of children going unvaccinated. Measles could have been wiped out in the West, but for him. People have died because of him. He's pure scum."
"(I haven’t) but My great grandfather did and he was shot at. I suppose I should add context, but it was at the battle of Verdun. And he was German."
"I'm going to bet that it isn't 'unmaintained', but that the management plan for the park - because there will be one - has it down as a wildlife area that needs minimal intervention.

I'm also going to bet that it will have quite a variety of native species in it, probably together with an assortment of naturalised ones, such as sycamore too.

Planting this random Christmas tree may have little effect, or it involve digging up a few native plants - bluebells, oxslips, who knows what, that are protected under the law, but not actually visible above ground at this time of year.

Furthermore, if this conifer does actually get established, it may well deprive more beneficial to wildlife native trees of light, space and other resources that they would need to thrive.

I'm sure that you have good intentions,  but randomly planting stuff wherever you take a fancy to without taking any regard of the plans and species that are already in place will do more harm than good in the long run."
Theoretically yes. Feasibly no.

Disgusting fella thought it would be funny to fart in front of everyone but followed through and had to leave the office red faced to change his trousers.
"Short answer, it's too expensive.

Longer answer, It depends whether you buy your ticket in advance, whether you travel at off-peak times, whether you have a discount card for young or old people.

If you just turn up on the day and want to travel at peak times it'll cost you a fortune."

"The only time I contacted Ofcom was in 1999 after the first episode of Queer as Folk.

"I see a lot of Katie Hopkins and piers Morgan being thrown about. But I think they pale in comparison to the likes of anjem choudary and which ever cunt was the ring leader of the Rotherham rape gang.

They hate us cause they ain't us.
We used to go there on holiday every year when I was young and I can still remember being unable to buy bread and milk for my family because none of the cashiers would serve me :( I was 7 years old and trying my best to speak French! I had practised what to say beforehand with my dad and even if it came out totally incomprehensible (which it might well have done) surely it's clear what a little kid with money and a bottle of milk in her hand wants?! This happened every year and by the last time I went I'd stopped trying to speak French or interact with French people at all. Just typing this out is making me angry!
Get the parcels delivered to a pick-up point somewhere. I think DPD offer this as an option.
"Crawley? I'm sorry to hear that :)

On a more serious note - put it this way-  although I've worked for a company based in Crawley for 5 years, I've not had much desire to move to live there. It's a functional [new town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom). Traffic at rush hour is a nightmare. Has all amenities you may need."
"My old boss was, in everything but name, David Brent mixed with Alan Partridge. He would make the worst puns all the live long day. He’d put whoopie cushions on our chairs as if we wouldn’t notice it sitting on top of the swivel seat. Just stuff a fifty year old should have grown out of. It was so tiring, we loved it when he was out of office because we could actually get on with work.

He was also a semi-professional cricketer back in the day. 

All of us knew this because **when each of us was hired** he ‘gifted’ us a copy of his autobiography (published at least a decade ago). You know books that have that damp smell? I’m pretty sure they were kept in the boot of his car in case of an autobiographical emergency. Now, I’m not a girly girl by any means but if there’s one sport that is pointless it’s a game that lasts for days without clear sight of a winner. I don’t care about cricketers now, let alone ones that haven’t really ever done anything of note. 

He also kept a copy on his desk facing whatever guest he was hosting. He’d listen to their spiel for a while, then blatantly stop listening, start smiling and glancing at it and completely unprompted make comments about the book. “Bet ya wondering who that guy with the hair is aren’t ya!” Wink wink etc. Or he’d pick it up, and reference a chapter like it was the bible. Mid conversation.

It was awkward.

I could tolerate all that. But when I left the role he gave me a copy to leave at my dad’s grave because, being the same age and a sports fan, he wanted to pay respect to my dad in the best way.

I’ve not worked there for four years and my butt cheeks have only now started unclenching from the cringe. "
"If you go 10%+1 you’re just as bad, except you are actively trying not to get caught. The 10%+1 isn’t a thing. There’s a tolerance that an operator can add in, but it’s discretionary. 
You can’t go and judge other drivers and what cars they drive for doing something that you admitted to doing in the previous sentence!"
"Firstly: when people say 'trains' they do not mean the London underground, or any intra-city transport.  Those are variable city-by-city, some are good, some aren't good.

Secondly: if you are visiting the UK as a tourist and taking trains between large cities then the odds are that they will be just fine for you.  You'll be able to travel 'off peak' and book a ticket in advance, and it's likely not to be *that* expensive, and will probably run roughly on time, give or take 15 mins.

However: if you have to get a train every. single. working. day.  If you have to travel at peak times when it's busiest, and most expensive.  If your job depends on you actually getting to the office for 8.30, not for 8.45, then, yes, British trains are *absolutely shit*.

"At a previous place, there was a fella (Jim) who was a bad driver. Well I say that but I don't know for sure, it was just common knowledge. He didn't actually drive to work, he got the same bus as me. In the kitchen people would come in and say *""No bump on the way to work today? Haha!""* or point to a piece in the Metro about a car accident and say *""Oi Jim, was that you out yesterday? Haha!""* He would go along with it and laugh along. If some of us were walking to the shop and saw an incident of bad driving, someone would turn and say *""Jim's out and about! Hahaha!""*.

"On Thursdays I finish work early, at 3pm. Almost every time, my boss pretends that she doesnt know I finish early, and accuses me of trying to skip work without telling her. She did it the first time I left early, she got me, and we had a good laugh. It was pretty funny. The second time, I knew she was playing with me and we just laughed. The third time I played along, and went back to my desk, and we had a good laugh. 

Its been going on for 3 years now, and I just sort of laugh and shake my head without stopping. "

I would support the Queen as a leader for this country long before I would support any of the actual politicians
"As with most questions surrounding the power of the monarch the answer is ""technically yes, practically no.""

*On paper* everything the government does is in the name of the Queen. She has to sign all laws passed by Parliament to make them official.

*In reality* the Queen is politically savvy enough to know that if she ever did interfere with actual politics (without being asked by the government of the day) it would be the suicide of the monarchy.

The only reason the constitutional monarchy has survived into the 21st Century is that the Queen is entirely neutral. She ""follows the advice of her government"" (i.e. she does what they tell her) and never witholds Royal Assent from legislature that has passed both houses.

*If* the government collapsed (e.g. due to a vote of no confidence in Parliament) and one or more general elections ended up with hung Parliaments and the parties couldn't stop bickering and form a coherent government, triggering a constitutional crisis... *Then* she might intervene and appoint an interim government. But only then. And probably only once Parliament asked her to once they accept that they're incapable of forming one themselves."
"This thread has totally surprised me! I went to the south for a majority of our summer holidays as a child and only have positive memories of interactions.

Yesterday we had a 2 hour conversation about which predictive analysis model we should be using. I could have *died* - Steve wanted to use all of the European data when we agreed months ago that every region is separate.
"Not bants so much but I will share the most cringe thing that’s ever happened to me in work. 

It was my first ever job - and every morning staff would come into the office past my desk to sign in. Every morning this bloke would tell me an absolute belter of a Dad joke, crease himself up and then ask “you got one for me? Go on - you must have a joke for me. Go on ....”

Every morning I did not have a joke available in my brain to tell him until one day. 

“Yes. Yes I do actually, here we go: I bought my epileptic mate a strobe light for his birthday. He’s gonna have a fit when he sees it”. 

Silence. 

He took a deep breath and then said very, very quietly “I really don’t appreciate that joke. I know you’ve not been working here long so you don’t know but my son is epileptic. And it’s hard. It’s very hard for us”. 

I cringed so much I wanted to disappear. There were many levels to this embarrassment. The embarrassment to myself, the embarrassment to him, and the awkwardness for the 5 other people sat on my bank on desks who witnessed it. I apologised and he left in silence. 

Wait - it gets worse. 

Later that day he cornered me whilst making tea in the kitchen and said in a disappointed tone “I really thought you were better than that you know...” and tutted at me. 

The next day I saw him alone to apologise again sincerely and he just dismissed me by holding his hand up and said “forget it”. 

I will never tell a joke again. It was so painful and I still wince thinking about it now. "
I complained to the ASA about a Nando’s advert that offered free chicken on Twitter a few months ago. I clicked on it and it turned out you had to buy a bottle of sauce and enter the code to get the free chicken. They upheld the complaint and I found out that the company name is actually Nando’s Chickenland Ltd
"I got an advert banned by the ASA when I was a teenager. I was on a ""I'm so punk I'm going to take down The Man"" thing so I complained about a Nestlé advert for cereal.

Think they were spouting some bullshit about the benefits of wholegrain, back before wholegrain was a thing. There wasn't any proof that wholegrain had any special benefits (there may be now but I couldn't find any then) so ASA banned it. Still got the letter somewhere."
"Reading this infuriated me, I can’t imagine the cheek somebody would need to drive up onto your grass. 

Might I recommend some well-concealed planks of wood with protruding nails?"
"This might be hugely unpopular but: Owen Jones.

I like and agree with most things that he says but he comes across massively arrogant and pompous which pushes me further away from agreeing with him. I think he’s a bit too militant sometimes."

"I had a similar thing once because I used to play pool on my lunch break with some others from the office. The table was ok but the cues were absolutely shagged, so we bought our own.

One bloke would sit next to the office door and without fail shout ""Oi lads, off shooting are we?"". Every. Fucking. Day. The routine was so strong, you could pretty much lip sync it as we were leaving."
"Katie Hopkins is pretty abhorrent. She's just a spiteful, hate filled, nasty human being. 

On Twitter she famously tweeted that Jack Monroe supported vandalism of a war memorial. Despite being incorrect she refused to apologise, refused to donate money to charity as Monroe suggested in way of an apology and was subsequently sued for libel. She lost. 

On debt: ""The only thing people in debt have in common other than bad money management, is an ability to blame anyone but themselves."" She has since filed for an IVA to avoid bankruptcy and had to move.

On being a working mother: ""The difference between most mothers and me is that I didn't sit around drinking coffee at baby group for 12 months after the birth of my baby. No, in three weeks I was back in my suit, back at my desk earning profit for my business and I don’t see why other women shouldn't do the same."" Later followed by ""I think women are really vicious in the work place, they’re really jealous, really competitive. Women are emotional, they cry in toilets. The sisterhood only extends as far as the kitchen door. Men talk in logic and rational terms, they don’t squark and make a noise."" So women can work but not be emotional, competitive, vicious (all the things she appears to be) 

On babies:"" Ginger babies. Like a baby. Just so much harder to love."" Has the most miserable looking children ever who she once described as her son being good looking but her daughters not. 

On children's names: She said that she didn’t like footballers’ names or geographical names like “Brooklyn” or “London”. When asked about he daughter who is called India Katie replied: “That’s not a geographical location. It’s a lovely name for a lovely child.”

In response to Trump's travel ban she asked why: Muslims always seek asylum in Christian countries and not in an ""Arab land."" The response from Sheikh Nasser. 

""My dear, it’s because those “Muslim” countries are ruled by dictators that certain “Christian” countries installed. Also, the U.S isn’t a Christian country, it’s secular. Remember the separation of church and state thing we learned in middle school""

So suffice to say, she's just a horrible, hypocitical, mean human being who slates people left, right and centre but does the exact things she's says she hates. She makes no sense whatsoever and just looks to spread hatred and bad feeling wherever she goes. She's been sacked from her two platforms on which to spew hatred and she's about to be bankrupt if not already. Oh how the mighty have fallen. "

"Quite a lot of stuff. Certain types of digital things such as sim card deals. Utility bills for things such as water, which is free of charge (at least, in Scotland, not sure about the rest of the UK). Groceries such as vegetables and some toiletries. Alcohol in pubs (again, in some areas. It's a different story in wealthier cities, but in much of Scotland and Northern England it's often quite cheap compared to much of Europe, when you adjust for serving in pints rather than litres). Bank accounts - in some European countries you are charged a monthly rate just for having a normal bank account. "
"This is literally the only reason i maintain my twitter presence now; I used to use it for career based stuff, but i still use follower gaining tactics to keep my following in the low thousands and I ALWAYS get a response when I complain and tag the company.

Whilst washing him, we had to turn him on his side when suddenly he makes a groaning sound. I lost my shit and screamed and ran out the door. Needless to say, I was always made fun of for that incident, and whenever I was sitting down relaxing, someone would come behind me and try to give me a fright because they realised how jumpy I was.

"The first two and the latter two (throw in Bangladeshis too) likely get confused for each other fairly often, mostly out of ignorance rather than malice (I'll admit to having thought that Iranians *are* Arabs until very recently).

Prejudice in the UK seems to be based more on (perceived, and often ignorant stereotypes of) culture and religions these days rather than directly stemming from ethnicity or race (although the correlation remains ofc).  Generally speaking, the less 'Muslamic' someone looks, the better they'll probably do.

That said, I'd feel pretty comfortable in assuming that Indians face the least discrimination.  We're more culturally familiar with them due to, well, having occupied the place for a decent length of time and the stereotypes we apply to them are likely to have even the most biased assuming they're a doctor or work in a restaurant/takeaway.  We quite like both curry and not being ill, so that's all good.  They might get a few crap jokes about doing the needful though."
"10%+1=78 on the motorway, which I agree is below the actual speed a lot of people (myself included) drive. My reasoning is I'm on a specially built road with no surprise junctions, no pedestrians, and I'm separated from the opposite direction traffic, so I feel 80 is much safer than for example 60 on a country road.

I've never seen anyone pulled by the police on the motorway under 90 mph, and even then you're only going to get points - it's once you go over the ton that things start to get serious.

As for speed cameras, I know where all the fixed ones are on my common routes, and I believe the average speed cameras are significantly more forgiving  (though I don't mess with them, I just set my cruise control at the speed limit and curse). "
"I complained to either Ofcom or the ASA (can't remember which) about how long the advert breaks were on channel 4 or ITV's on demand player, because I knew they restrict the total length of ad breaks per hour on those channels and it was way over that. I figured if they actually took my complaint seriously, I'd save all that time waiting for the adverts to be over in future so it was worth sending a five-minute email. They just replied saying while that length of adverts wouldn't have been allowed when it was shown on TV, no-one regulates that for on-demand services."
"Where I work there's a small group of us who have been moved downstairs due to the business expanding while everyone else is still upstairs in the main office. The kitchen is also upstairs.

After she got over the shock of moving desks after a 15 year residency, Karen decided to get a special tray so that, rather than getting a hot drink ourselves if we want one, she could instigate a 'tea run' system (which basically allows her to spend half an hour several times a day taking orders and making drinks). 

This has led to two exciting new bits of banter.

Firstly, every time she appears upstairs someone has to shout out 'Here she is, Karen the waitress - got yourself a little white pad yet Karen? Giving you any tips are they?', and every time she appears in our office downstairs someone will say ""Alright Karen, what time's the next brew? Are they paying you extra for running a coffee shop yet?""

Secondly, and this is EVEN FUNNIER, when Karen comes back with the drinks she likes to play a little game with me as the only coffee drinker. Every day, Karen will offer me a mug that isn't mine, and if I reflexively go to take it, she will say ""Ooh, nearly had you, nearly made you a tea drinker!""  before giving me the correct drink. If I point out that's not my mug, she'll say ""Ooh, no flies on you today - you sure you need this coffee or should I go back and make a decaff?""

Either way, the office laughs and laughs, and Karen is universally referred to as ""a character"".

"Tips for adjusting to UK life:

* Start drinking tea now. Whilst coffee is quite prevalent, we are predominantly a tea drinking nation, so you will need to know how to make a cup properly.

* We drive on the left over here and our roads are a lot smaller than you're used to. Also, automatic transmissions are much less popular over here, so if you're not used to driving stick, find a friend who drives a stick shift and ask them if you can practice before you come over.

* Yes, we have many of the food chains you have over there. The smaller portion sizes will probably be a bit of a shock, though.

* Tipping is nowhere near as common over here. The general rule is that you tip in restaurants, but only for exceptional service. Bar staff are not usually tipped with every drink, but if you want to reward them for good service, say ""and one for yourself"" and they will either get themselves a drink on you, or they will add the cost of a drink to your order total and enjoy it when they're off shift. Some pubs or bars will have a tip jar on the bar.

* Speaking of pubs, the vast majority don't have table service. Drinks are ordered at the bar and you take them to where you are sitting. If you're with a group of friends, you need to learn the etiquette of 'the round'. Each person in the group takes it in turn to buy the drinks for the whole group. That is a 'round' of drinks. If money is a bit tight, state this at the start of the night and say that you'll get your own. This will excuse you from the round system for the night. If you pick an expensive drink when it's not your round, don't substitute something cheaper when it's your round. This is very bad form and will result in everyone else ordering expensive drinks when your round comes again."
"Had the same thing with our neighbours. Every time I went out drinking I'd come back at 1am and just constantly ring their buzzer (which is very loud), they'd always scream that there are young children in the house (there are), I said I'd stop when I got my parcels back.  


Now I don't get anything delivered to home, I send it to my work. If you can't do that, do a drop off. Specifically mention to couriers not to leave at neighbors."
