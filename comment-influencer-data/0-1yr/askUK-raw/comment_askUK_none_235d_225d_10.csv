"Hampden Park in Glasgow, so Scotland's and Queens Park's home ground has the main stand on the South side, but again does mean you don't get the sun in your eyes.

"Maybe you could get some things very wrong, e.g. serve the courses in the wrong order (cheese first, soup after mains), make sure you call the main course the entree, put the wrong cutlery down (if available), literally warm the beer, (and then serve it with loads of ice), make a bizarre combination like fish and chips with Yorkshire pudding. Or a course that is British but doesn't fit at all in a formal setting - cheese on toast or baked beans. Best of all would be to serve a formal banquet with multiple sets of cutlery, glasses, etc, but give each guest one of those trays to hold on their lap (and call it formal dining)."
"Nah, it's fine. Depending on how much you'd be willing to spend, there are some lovely places in Bedford. De Parys avenue and Kimbolton Road spring to mind, or even the Castle Road area. The latter made it onto the Times best places to live list last year."

It was early 80s but my school was similar. 8.55 registration. 9.00 assembly. 9.15 period 1. 9.50 period 2. 10.25 play time. 10.40 period 3. 11.15 period 4. 11.50 dinner time. 13.50 registration 13.55 period 5. 14.30 period 6. 15.05 playtime. 15.20 period 7. 15.55 period 8. 16.30 home time. They knocked an hour off dinner while I was there so we finished at half 3 in the last couple of years. 1 hours homework a night on top as I remember but we all used to copy off each other at dinner time.

It's not grim at all. If your only knowledge of Butlins comes from visiting it in the 70s or 80s, or of watching old *Hi-De-Hi* episodes I can see why you might think that. But their camps are actually quite pleasant places to stay, with accommodation not significantly different from that in Center Parcs.

There are three Butlins camps: Bognor, Minehead, and Skeggy. Only one of those is on the south coast!

Serve all food using a metal cloche. Especially the jelly

Light all candles very formally with a long refillable lighter

Carve meat with an electric carving knife and treat it as a grand spectacle and a glimpse into the future

A dessert trolley is a must

Excessive cutlery options including fish knives for non-fish starters

Cubes of butter served on ice

Consider a rubbish and underwhelming fondu for the main course

Badly printed menu, laminated and issued on a clipboard

Sorbet between EVERY course

Bowls of warm water (with lemon slice) to cleanse hands or hot towels serves with tongs

Schnapps shots to finish 

Not an 80s thing but you should definitely make a wine menu for the guests to peruse, with only one wine option on it
