"Where do you think is better? Every country has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. 

The UK isn’t some perfect country that’s all handouts and rainbows. No country on this earth is, but at the end of the day the UK is one of the richest and safest counties on Earth. The reality is that there are only a handful of countries that you can move to and live a lifestyle at least as good as you can in this country. 

Secondly, I would say that the north of the country is slightly more than retail and industrial parks. The north might not get the investment it needs, but a lot of people from the south seem to think that as soon as you go north of the Watford gap it’s a barren wasteland, which is obviously bullshit.

Yes, wages are much lower in the north. But you aren’t spending £1200 a month for a closet in a hovel up here either. "

"I grew up abroad and lived most of my life in a hot desert country. The things I like most about this country are how mild its nature is.

Compared to every other place I've been, the weather is just fine. We complain about the heat and the cold and the wetness and the dryness. But I like that we have variations in weather and most of the time, it's just harmless. We don't hit +50 degC or -50 degC, it floods a bit, but *most* of the country is reasonably safe, and it doesn't get dry so often and for so long that all the plants die. Let me tell you, scorching sun, dusty dry air and 50 degrees got old pretty fast where I grew up. I'd much rather a grey 15-20 degrees that the UK is most of the time.

We have very mild natural disasters compared to most of the world, we don't get blizzards, typhoons, tsunamis, tornados, earthquakes etc etc. We have almost no dangers wildlife whatsoever, relatively few households pests and insect infestations, considerably less mosquitoes (although some places have rather a lot of midges).

Generally speaking, our little island home is really quite *safe*. Nothing is out to kill us, be they animals, insects, the weather, nature itself. It seems that our biggest worry is really ourselves. [Insert commentary on current political and social chaos here]"

"Trading Standards. RSPCA. Small claims court for your money back.

If you bought the puppy over a third party seller site (Gumtree, Preloved etc) then contact them as well, as they may be able to ban her.

Getting in contact with the other puppy owners may be nearly impossible, as I wouldn't have thought that anyone will hand you their personal details without their consent.

If people want to buy a puppy off a breeder:

* Always make sure you see mum with puppies
* Never buy a puppy sight unseen, or accept that ""mum is on a walk"" or some other excuse.
* The breeder should be asking you as many questions as you ask them - you want them to care where the puppy is going
* The breeder should be happy for you to visit multiple times
* A lot of breeders will include ""puppy contracts""
* A lot of good breeders will insist that if the puppy is not the right fit for you, you need to return it to them instead of selling it on.
* A good breeder will be able to detail the worming schedule and be able to tell you what drug they used.
* And remember, **it is illegal to sell a puppy without a microchip** - the breeder is meant to be registered as the first keeper of the puppy because it details how many animals they're breeding. If the puppy is not microchipped and initially registered to the breeder - ask yourself why the breeder doesn't want people to know that information.
* As of October 1st, new laws mean that anyone selling puppies for a profit needs a breeding licence - so if you're exchanging money for puppy, ask to see that.
* Depending on breed, the parents should have undergone health testing specifically for their breed. The Kennel Club has lists of which tests are good for which breeds. If you have a crossbreed (labradoodle etc) then the parents should still have undergone testing - animals can inherit disease from either side!"

"I've been working with a close family friend since they opened their burger stall food stall for about 3 years now so I think I can answer this. 

It's not a money printing machine. Be prepared for long hours and little pay. They originally started doing music festivals (Secret Garden Party, Latitude,) but the reason food costs so much there is the INSANE pitch fees (couple k months in advance) causing your food to be pricier. But then, if you dont do well, its devastating. We had to throw away 4/500 rolls. 

On the plus side, the best kind of events are ones where you are paid outright or 'small' ones that garuntee people are gonna eat. E.g weddings, food festivals, firework shows. These are the ones where you can set up, bosh out hundreds of burgers and piss off. However, they are hard to find and even harder to get into, as local towns usually have existing ties. 

Another thing is the food you make. Its gotta be good and easy to make. People will eat anything, but if its shit, they wont come back for seconds. You also need to make sure your design is appealing to people walking past too - first impressions count. We gave the burgers musical names (e.g beef = elvis, lamb = will i lamb) which meant people saw it, laughed with a mate, then gave the menu a proper read. 

Anyway, I think that covers most of the basics. If you have any more questions shoot away! 

e: oh yeah and for the love of GOD make sure you are tip top on food hygiene. The inspections are piss easy to pass because it's just so simple to keep things clean and separate cooked/raw foods ect... It's all basic stuff, you just have to keep on it. I once saw a chippy stall's staff go to the toilet wearing their APRONS! This was at a festival too, so it was a portaloo!!!! Never be those guys."

"Move around. Layers are useless unless they have heat to trap. Sitting still will make you colder.

"York? Close to the Dales and North York Moors for the green space, well connected to other cities (easy access to Leeds and on the ECML for Edinburgh, Newcastle and London) if you want to try somewhere else, good bar scene and the Yorkshire East Coast is just over an hour away. "
"Well there are a number of problems with that scenario.

The first that springs to mind is the simple cost of transport. Getting over the channel is cheap - incredibly cheap - compared to shipping across the Atlantic Ocean. That alone adds a huge amount to the cost of British goods in the US, Canada etc. Now that’s not insurmountable, clearly we already sell things to them, but it means that whatever the UK wants to trade with them has to be special, not just another variant on what they do already.

The second issue I can immediately think of would be the quite marked difference between UK and US production and product standards. I, for example, would rather go veggie then eat [chlorinated chicken](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/buying-and-supplying/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article), not particularly because of that practice alone but because of the underlying lack of hygiene it is used to compensate for.

Another problem (for me, not so much for some eg Jacob Rees-Mogg) would be that to become more competitive British employers would have to look hard at trying to change current working practices and employment laws to be more like American ones. I like having 25 days leave a year and I really don’t want to go to the American average (which I’ve read is closer to 10). I don’t think employment rights should be drastically chopped - I want factories and other workplaces to be essentially safe places to be. Working conditions and employment rights in the UK cost employers more than the American conditions and rights do - mainly because Americans don’t have much in that way. American production safety doesn’t have a good record. Many working in offices won’t think that applies to them but of course it does, just in different ways. A return to asbestos cladding for example (not illegal in the US, I read recently) to help keep offices warm cheaper? Nice enough for the balance sheet, not so much for anyone around the stuff if it gets disturbed and they happen to breath in. Asbestosis is incurable and fatal, after all. Just one example, of course."

"Or buy from a reputable breeder who has assured status and certificates of health for the pups as well as a comprehensive puppy pack.

Do your research before buying a puppy and you won’t end up with a poorly dog on your hands. It’s not hard to do. So many people buy from puppy farms or back garden breeders and then whine about it afterwards. It’s pretty pathetic. Half an hour of your time on the internet and it could have all been avoided instead of coming on Reddit afterwards for the advise you should have got before."

"Firstly: it is shitter being a young person now than it has been for a while.  Economically and socially there are challenges you have to face that are entirely novel.  

BUT

Secondly: as everyone will immediately tell you if you express these views, you are still better off than approx 90% of the global population.  You have clean water, aren't at much risk of being executed in a secret police prison for no real reason, and if you get bitten by a snake it's a cool story for twitter not RIP you.

HOWEVER

Thirdly: this doesn't mean you need to suck it all up and accept that this is your lot.  What it means is you have to have a good, long, hard, look at the things that make you happy and that don't; at what you'd sacrifice for change and what you wouldn't. Then you can start thinking about other options and doing something proactive, rather than moaning.
For example: if you're looking for a more collaborative and society-focused life, and are willing to give up some privacy and independence maybe Scandinavia is the place for you.  Or, maybe, you'd be wiling to give up some of your standard of living and easy access to certain kinds of diversity in arts &amp; culture, for the sake of a more relaxed pace of life and more dramatic natural spaces, in which case, New Zealand might be a great bet.
Or, maybe, having researched it, you decide UK is the best balance for you after all."

"Be aware OP i bet the majority of these posts are bias towards where they live.
Culture wise especially music scene i would reccomend Bristol.
Along with Manchester it has had one of the most influential music scenes in the world, especially during the 90’s.
England is small so you aren’t that far from anything really but Bristol is South-West which is not a bad thing at all! Arguably the most picturesque part of the country, also it is near the coast.

If you could afford it then i would reccomend a spa town like Leamington which is in the midlands so all the main cities (in England) are within a 2 hour drive away (, London, Manchester are about an hour, Birmingham about 30 mins)  There are alot of good bars/pubs/park in Leamington. Also next to Warwick and not far from Stratford Upon Avon.

"There isn't an agreed-upon definition of *vegetarian* or *vegan* so it's really down to the question of whether your customers would feel misled. The European Vegetarian Union is working with the EU to create an EU-wide definition of these terms and their proposed definition includes:

&gt; In the manufacture, preparation, treatment or placing on the market of foods that are labelled as vegetarian or vegan, appropriate precautions must be taken, to avoid cross-contamination with products that do not comply with the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 [ie foods made with products of animal origin]. However, the presence of these cross-contaminations shall be allowed in foods that are labelled as vegetarian or vegan, provided that despite appropriate precautions such presence is technically unavoidable under good hygiene practice.

I suspect your customers would agree with the EVU that the cross-contamination in your restaurant is avoidable and thus should be avoided."
I find it interesting how some people in the comments are horrified at only bathing once a week. Personally i think a lot of people are used to washing too much nowadays. Like how you always put too much powder in the washing machine because you don't know how much is the right amount.

You may feel like you're getting ripped off by paying less. You may well be getting ripped off if you agree to the proposed terms.. Part of the university experience is facing this sort of problem and learning to deal with it like a proper grown up. I suggest you speak to your future housemates and come up with an agreement together. 

Housemate in largest room states he's not willing to pay more than £20 a month more, you're not willing to pay £20 less. There's a gap in your expectations, it's time to negotiate. I suggest you think about what you *do* want from the deal, and use that as a starting point. "
"Gay clubs are for gay people and are not there as a zoo for straight people. The more straight people there are, the less welcoming it is to gay people. Gay bars exist so that gay people don't have to deal with a majority straight crowd.

In the past gay bars have closed down as they have become known for as a place for straight people to hang out. There's little point going to a gay bar if you are going to deal with screaming hens groups. Once girls start going to a gay bar then straight guys will inevitably follow. They think it's easier to pull girls in a gay bar...

Once a bouncer has made a decision it's unlikely they will change their mind. If anything it will lead others to question them."
"You don't HAVE to, no. But it all depends what the entry requirements for the course are.

Some courses require a minimum grade in a specific subject.

For example my maths degree 15 years ago required a minimum of a Grade B in A-level Mathematics.

I think it depends on the course and the university. But since most entry requirements are static from year to year you can always contact unis to find out what they need for a specific course."

"I spent some time abroad in Central Europe. While I came to love where I was, living there did give me a new found appreciation for Britain.

I won't talk about standard of living or economics because other posters have done so sufficiently. What I will say is that many people in Britain (perhaps because of a political situation more polarised than it has been) don't appreciate the benefits of living in one of the most civil societies in the world. It's easy to look at the arguments about Brexit or the economy and say we are a divided nation at our throats, but in terms of real life (rather than reddit or the 'political bubble') you live in one of the most mild-mannered and tolerant societies in history. You are far less likely to be a victim of violent crime than in many European countries, let alone the USA. You are, if some form of minority, far less likely to receive abuse for who you are. Your political views are unlikely to make a dent on your personal relationships, unlike in many places I went to in Central Europe where it did feel more divisive in that sense, in that many people wouldn't really have much to do with people who don't share their way of seeing things. For example, the current divides in Germany over immigration are more visceral than Brexit I would argue, as the majority of people here are generally willing to accept the other side to their own views has some valid points, or at least not willing to define themselves through such things and not associate with people who see things differently."
