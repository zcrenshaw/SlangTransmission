"Update - I have very graciously been offered accommodation for tonight and possibly tomorrow as well. I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to read this and respond, every one of you helped me in some way and I'm honestly a little bit taken aback by the kindness shown considering when I first wrote this, I wasn't sure it would be a welcome addition to the page or whether it would get lost in all the other posts. You've made my day and instilled a bit of hope in me when I needed it most. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you so much everyone."
"I reckon it’s motherly instinct paradoxically mixing with a power move rooted in insecurity from getting older and seeing younger generations become their peers. You could write fifty thousand words on the subject, really break down the social factors, but I’m not a social psychologist so I may be completely full of shit

Edit: hey incels, dont respond to this peddling your poison about women being allowed to do anything they want. Fuck off, you people make my skin crawl"
"Surgery has a second meaning as an occasion on which professional advice is given, similar to the word ""clinic"".

&amp;#x200B;

For example, MPs also hold surgeries where they meet with their constituents.  
"
Probably because they have to cart a film crew and their own ridiculous egos everywhere they go.
"&gt;Mine is people that use their handbrake at traffic lights and then spend ages fumbling WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SET OFF AGES AGO.

Ha, mine is people thst DON'T use their handbrake when they'll be stationary for a little while, STOP BLINDING ME WITH YOUR BRAKE LIGHTS."
"&gt; For example, MPs also hold surgeries where they meet with their constituents

and chop off their limbs.  It's a really big problem that seemingly nobody wants to address."
"Perhaps try one of these https://uk.isidewith.com/political-quiz where you can answer some questions and it tries to tell you which parties match your views. They’re not perfect, but it’s a start..."
"There's a hostel in Aberdeen for £20 a night, they have space tonight.

[https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/aberdeen-youth-hostel.en-gb.html#important\_info](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/aberdeen-youth-hostel.en-gb.html#important_info)

Nothing fancy, a bunk in a dorm.

Any good? I'll paypal you the £20.

Edit - cracking effort here folks. I hope OP takes everyone up on their offers."
"I have another one - people who get to the ticket gate at the station AND THEN DECIDE TO LOOK FOR THEIR TICKET!

Hanging is too good for them."
"I started this post thinking 'oh, what a nice idea' and then when I read what actually happened I'd switched entirely to 'this is way over the top'.
I get not wanting to do it in person (although I think that would actually be the best approach) but a letter sounds like it would be weird/overkill in this circumstance; just send her a very brief text or an email saying: I heard I offended you on Sunday with our stupid joke; I am really sorry for upsetting you.  No more, no less."
"I'm a Bricklayer, my job was advertised as working with bricks. All i do all day is lay bricks, so very accurate."
What are you even planning to tell your neighbour...please stop smoking in the only place  in your flat whereby you are allowed to smoke?
Those stock images of two pairs of feet poking out of crisp white bedsheets that are used in nearly every news article about anything sex and relationship related.
Agree with Patak's - but buy the curry paste rather than just a jar of sauce. Means you have to fry it up with the chicken and veggies and add a bit of water but nice fresh flavours without the sort of gloopy synthetic taste you get from a jar of sauce.

"Unless I was after one specific thing that I knew I could only get in that shop, I’d leave if you did that to me. 

A greeting is ok, much more than that and I’m gone."
"I'm a teacher

Turns out I'm actually an educational psychologist, social worker, policeman, nanny, sports coach, race relations officer, chaplain, ESL teacher, Special Needs Assistant, admin assistant, data entry clerk, PA, examiner, customer service advisor, cleaner, decorator, buyer (with my own money) and paramedic.

Who occasionally teaches my actual subject."
"I don't have recommendations but gluten free is pretty huge now compared to what it was. Every major supermarket seems to have a free from section - have you tried much from there?

And home baking is always a good alternative."
Have you tried not being an utter knob?
"People with no situational awareness.

Often come across them when out running. These creatures sometimes travel in herds walking three abreast, or if alone, wearing a hoodie, with earphones, looking at their phones.

I swear I'm going to buy myself an airhorn to take with me when I go running."
"&gt; you all have tea makers

Presumably you mean a kettle, which is a hot water maker.

&gt; or come around to refill an empty glass of coffee if you did get one.

If you want another one, you must ask for and pay for another one."
I make sure it's fair trade.
"You need permission for commercial filming on the tube iirc and presumably it's too expensive to be worth it

Edit: [tfl link](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/filming-and-photography/filming-and-photography-on-tfl?intcmp=1594)"
What about people that don't use *any* brakes at traffic lights and instead continually roll forwards or rock back and forth because they have a complete inability to hold a bite properly?
And where are these clubs exactly? Just so I know where to avoid them obvs. 
"Except, as it says in that BBC article, she wasn't even 'underweight':  
&gt;""The online fashion retailer said the model was a UK size 8, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.8, within the healthy weight range.""    
  
...so it's a case of an advert of a woman of healthy weight being banned, because people's perception of what constitutes a healthy weight is divorced from the norm (which is fat, now).  
  
I don't think the fashion industry should be promoting unhealthy extremes, though they also have to market to a broad range of sizes - so it's a tough thing to balance. I personally think the whole body-positive thing surrounding overweightness can go too far in the direction of normalising what is a serious health risk. Likewise, perpetuating the notion that the ideal is a skeletal waif isn't healthy either. "
"&gt; the fag counter

That's a phrase I didn't expect to see."
"Fags are cigarettes in the UK, the fag counter is where you buy cigarettes in a supermarket."
"It's not just limbs, either. My mate Tony, he had his stomach and intestines replaced with a Tesco's bag for life and some Pringles tubes. Gustatory Replacement Service, they called it."
"The answer to any questions about neighbours is talk to them politely, most folk are fundamentally reasonable. Don't go in trying to quote legislation or that, just politely explain the problem and ask if they wouldn't mind smoking a bit further to the right or out the front door."
"In addition to the reasons others have given...

The Apprentice exists so that we can watch fuckwits fuckwit. If they aren't allowed to take the Tube, there will obviously be even more fuckwittery for the editors to work with."
"Update, me and a manager from the bus company have agreed to a sit down, we are awaiting word from the college. 3 people in the one room and sort this out hopefully"
"Sounds like you're pretty pro active about this and doing the right thing.

I'd also consider getting local councillors involved, your local MP or their office, and local media such as a local newspaper "

"Spitting in the street. It doesn't do any harm and it's not like they're spitting at me personally, but it makes me want to punch their disgusting faces.

I'm guilty of the handbrake thing. I'm still learning, how are you all so quick off the mark when lights change?? Also tailgaters, but that's not innocuous. I'm looking forward to passing my test so I can troll tailgaters by slowing down even more."
"Ranch dressing tastes and looks like sick. You can get it in supermarkets, but you can also get a hundred other things that are much tastier. Why would you have it on fish and chips when tartare sauce exists? "
"I've worked in Aberdeen before on ships and the port chaplain Howard Drysdale is knows to do good work in the seafaring community.

If you contact him maybe he can find help for you.

"Update as requested - I had the longest shower I think I've ever had and the best sleep I think I've ever had in my life! I'm on my way into town to go to social bite and get something to eat. I've very luckily got enough to get another three nights in a bed which I'm unbelievably thankful for!!

Another user messaged to say she could look over my CV and give me some advice as she's a professional which I've just sent over and I'm looking forward to updating it with her tips to hopefully secure work as soon as possible, which I'll also be doing today, all day as well as seeing a recommended solicitor to have a look at my case.

I'm going to do my absolute best to use these next three nights to gain the upper hand here so hopefully I get some good news in them. Once again, I'd like to thank everyone that took the time to wish me well and help me out, I'm still in a bit of a state of shock to be honest.. I never saw this coming but I'm INCREDIBLY thankful.

Time to get to work and try to fix this."
Ill PayPal a night as well 
"UPDATE: I sent her a text saying:

""*Hey Friend A, first of all I want to apologise for what I said and did on Sunday. It wasn't funny. It was just distasteful. You made an amazing roast dunner and it was a wonderful day. Thank you xx""* 

&amp;#x200B;

She replied with 

""*Thank you, really nice of you to say. No worries, I know you didn't mean it. See you at the pub quiz xx*""

&amp;#x200B;"
"People who stop to talk at the exact worst place to stand in a hallway. 

I’m convinced there’s a psychological element to it, some kind of target fixation or something. If a corridor in my work is wide then gets narrow, people will always stand and have a quick chat at exactly the narrow point, so everyone has to squeeze past them. There’s a cross corridor that everyone always pauses in the centre of, so every single person walking through in any direction has to push past. You see the same thing in shops, people stopping right in front of the door to check their phones rather than just to the side outside the door, or just to the side inside the door. 

Anywhere else guys. Literally anywhere else. "
Because how the fuck would they advertise plus size clothing with a twiglet model? 
"I'd like to apologize to anyone that may be offended by this or feel it's dampening the regular mood on this page, I'm just trying to use all the avenues I can and I don't mean to cause any offence by doing that."
Embrace your shit surnames. Double-barrel that fucker and be proud of it
"I had a job up until a month or so ago through an agency for space solutions but the job ended so I wasn't kept on. I'm not a sponge or anything, I used to work in oil and gas but I haven't been able to get back and things have been a bit rough since then really. I'm actively applying for anything and everything and I've recently made contact with Apex to make my CV stand out more and work on interview skills cause I'm awful at them to be honest. I'm hoping once I've got the foundation of housing sorted, things will pick up."
"I personally dislike overly clingy retail staff, but bear in mind the replies you get on reddit aren't necessarily going to be representative of the general public. "
"lol, why is OP being downvoted? These pricks can smoke anywhere, her bedroom window cannot be moved. "
Hershey’s chocolate tastes like vomit.
Once went for a job landscape gardening. I ended up digging graves. 
"Today I counted 73 fags.

43 confirmed and 30 possible."
Very true. Little tip from my youth if you are or start going out drinking in clubs...don't go to clubs that solely play 70s 80s and probably 90s music nowadays. Those old wenches will destroy a young man.
"I buy Primark 120 denier velvet touch tights. They're microfibre with lycra and they hardly ever go baggy. They're handwash, but I machine wash them in a very fine mesh delicates bag I got from Lakeland. They sometimes go a bit fuzzy where they rub against the inside of my boots, but not anywhere else."
"Religious people. They aren't doing anything that directly affects me in any negative way (well, obviously some are, but I hate them for that more straightforward reason; I'm talking about inoffensive, privately religious people) and I firmly believe they can think whatever the hell they like, that's their prerogative; but it's still very frustrating to know that they can so readily accept a cognitive dissonance and live their lives without questioning it.

I like to think I'm as stupid as the next person, but it worries me that the next person may well believe in literal magic.

EDIT: And it begins; asked for an opinion, downvoted for giving it."
"Not having payment ready at tills.

Not having method of payment ready when boarding a bus.

People who insist on using self service checkouts but have no idea what they are doing."
"You're good - You're reaching out with a question to the community, it complies with the rules hence it stays up.

There's no obligation for /r/AskUK to be all fun all the time, and if that offends people then too bad."
"A lot of people went gluten free as a diet fad even though they have no medical issues with gluten. So the food industry started supplying more gluten free food which is great for people that have an intolerance.

Vegetarian and vegan food is a lot more popular now thanks to an uptick in people buying/requesting it.

"
"You should go to the GP and ask for help as it is obviously a big problem and sure tell them that you *have* taken alprazolam *but* be aware that the doctor is unlikely to prescribe you it and furthermore, going to a GP and specifically *requesting* alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam etc. is likely to be a red flag since they are all habit forming/addictive to various extents and all have street value. Also, as a non-American, using the brand names (Xanax, Valium, Ativan, Klonopin) would possibly make you look like more like a recreational user searching for a 'scrip.

On the pharmaceutical side, I would imagine that they would be keener to start you on an SSRI like sertraline (Zoloft) or fluoxetine (Prozac) which are antidepressants but also indicated for anxiety disorders. "
"Unnecessarily using ""Reply All"" to emails."
I've got a drunk belligerent uncle you can borrow.
"Why do most Scots prefer the Scottish flag, or most Welsh prefer the Welsh flag?

Because some people identify with their specific country as opposed to the union that joins all the countries together. The people you see with English flags do so because they probably feel, at least in that moment, perhaps with England doing well in a tournament or something, more English than British.

It's a personal gripe of mine that the English flag (and generally identifying as English) has so many negative connotations, to be honest."
have a child and force them to marry another double barred person and double barrel that
"I was just letting him know in case he didn't, thanks anyway Reddit police 👍"
"Probably the same way they keep advertising ""petite"" clothing (&lt;5'3) on 5'8 models."
"Not sure why everyone seems to be acting like you are over reacting. Tobacco smoke gets EVERYWHERE.  Unfortunately, if they can't smoke at home, where can they smoke? I am torn between ""their freedom ends where yours becomes affected"", and ""it's their home so they should be allowed to smoke""."
Because getting a job and renting a place is just that easy. /s
"Thanks for this, I sent over an email from that link just explaining what the situation is, I'm not sure if anything will come of it but I'm really grateful for you giving me an option."
"I always get SNP &amp; Plaid Cymru, which isn't terribly helpful since I don't currently live in Scotland or Wales"
Been abroad too long mate
"Can't agree, double Barelled names smack of indecisivenesss."
"Reflex and Popworld. Stay informed, stay aware, stay safe."
"&gt; Restaurants seemed to also not offer coffee or come around to refill an empty glass of coffee if you did get one. Is coffee not well received?

Lol. What the hell restaurants did you go to ?  No automatic refills is not a thing but I can't recall ever not having a coffee option in an actual restaurant. Even dodgy caffs will offer you something they call coffee.

No we don't like Ranch dressing, yes you can get it in the American section of large grocery stores. "
"I help out at a night shelter during winter, most of our guests have jobs. But you try getting a deposit together as well as the first months rent on minimum wage. Or getting a reference when you've had no fixed abode or renting history for a while. Or passing a credit check when your credit is shot to pieces and you can't even open a bank account because you have no address. Or getting a guarantor for your tenancy when you either have no friends or family or no friends and family who'd be accepted as a guarantor. Homelessness is not just about not having a job, far from it."
"&gt;If we start doing this for all dangerous driving we see, what kind of culture are we creating?

It's possible it may be a safer one. I have no patience for intentionally unsafe driving. "
funny that on /r/AskUK
"Tea makers cracked me up, I won't lie. I wasn't sure if they were talking about a kettle or a teapot."
It's been spoons since i was 18. And I'm in my mid 30s. They tend to have strange names so they're just spoons 
"Yes you need to contact employers. 

Remember as a grad with no experience, you are in the largest pool of people that employers have to pick from so you need to stand out.

I don't think Americans can grasp the concept of food without sugar in it.
"I wouldn't buy from the US. On top of the purchase cost, you'll also pay import taxes. Amazon US does generally try to estimate and include these taxes in your purchase though. But as you said, sending back defective products will not be fun.

Stick to UK stores such as:

* Amazon UK
* Scan
* eBuyer
* Novatech
* Aria
* Overclockers"
"""Can I show you to your room""?

No, fuck off.  I can read room numbers you grasping cunt."
"Most taxi drivers are like this, because they all think they know lights so well. Its totally going to change now!... Now!... Now!... "
"Ask them not to do that any more. If they don't respect your boundaries, speak to a manager or HR."
"People not putting the little divider after their shopping on the belt at the till

Abandoning shopping trolleys around the car park (I wouldn't call that innocuous though)

"Part and parcel of living in a flat I'm afraid. I guess you just don't like the smell? I'm guessing it isn't really a health/air quality issue, otherwise you wouldn't live in central London."
Nobody’s going to get lung cancer or have an asthma attack from someone exercising upstairs.
