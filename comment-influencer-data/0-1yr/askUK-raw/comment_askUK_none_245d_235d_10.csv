"The loss of the Thirteen Colonies was a relatively minor blip in Britain's exponential rise to world dominance. In terms of long-lasting effects that Britain endured, She got off very lightly. Indeed, some might argue that the loss actually benefitted Britain in many ways.

For one, trade with the colonies rose rapidly between the 1780s and 1800. Exports of raw cotton from America to Britain, for example, rose from an annual sum of £15.5 million in the mid-1780s to almost £30 million by 1800. This was simply because the new Republic relied almost totally on trade with Britain in order to keep it financially viable. Britain, meanwhile, did not have to waste money protecting the Colonies, and, due to the fact that the cotton was mostly harvested by slaves and was therefore exceptionally cheap, was able to sell much of it to the European continent for a tidy profit, keeping the rest, which in turn fuelled the Industrial Revolution (for reference, in 1840, 80% of cotton used in the cotton mills that drove much of Britain's wealth came from the US). As a result, Britain's economy was rapidly growing post War of Independence, the same could not be said of other countries like France.

Couple this with the fact that Britain still held Canada, the lucrative money-making sugar plantations in the Caribbean, and was focusing her efforts on India, and you very soon realise why the war has left such little impact on the British collective conscience. Britain would, over the course of the 19th Century and well into the 20th Century grow to become the largest Empire the world had ever seen, and the loss of the US did almost nothing to impact that growth for the worse and, arguably, actually impacted it for the better.

To quote M Bison:

&gt; For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.

That is why it does not feature in practically any history course."

We have over 1000 years of our own documented history to get through. US has far less so can spend more time on each event. 
Lot of good comments in here but not seen enough blame on the media. Some outlets are resorting almost solely to making headlines that fuel arguments. While the media in this country had always had a tendency for being shite it's taking on new levels in the social media age
"Yep. It sounds a bit harsh but we have thousands of years of history to get a grasp of, whereas America has only 300ish years. To give British kids a good broad grounding in the sequence of formative events in our history (Celts, Anglo Saxons, Vikings, Normans, Medieval, Tudors, Stuarts, Georgians, Victorians, 20th century and World Wars) it really has to be whistlestop. Even if you take history to A Level or degree level there will still be significant gaps you have to fill in yourself. "

Americans: ""BUT WE NEED MOAR LAND!!!!!""

And then you lot revolted for the freedoms of not paying for the protection of the British Army and being allowed to continue genocide. 

That's how I was taught it anyway. I feel like the whole 'we fought for liberty' thing is more of a creation myth akin to Romulus and Remus. "
"It’s a piece of piss.. Most of the time we just loaf around in the waste ground behind the sorting office smoking tabs. On the odd days when we get some mail to deliver I usually chuck half of it in a ditch or just post it in another letterbox so I’m often done in a few hours. Perks are pretty good.. I make a few quid from old folks sending birthday money and there’s a bloke by the market who slips me fifty quid every time I intercept a credit card he’s applied for from one of the  an addresses on my route..

"&gt; Well, this one seems important

Why? It didn't significantly change British history, apart from the fact that the primary growth of what became the British Empire moved from the North American continent to the southern part of Asia.

From an American perspective of course it's a major event, literally the life-defining moment of your nation. From ours, it's just another relatively unimportant war. Even within the living memories of those British soldiers who fought in that war, the long-lasting war against Napoleon that began a couple of decades later was of far, far more contemporary importance."

I like that I can get answers right. I don't even understand the questions on University Challenge. 
THANK YOU! This is a fantastic answer and exactly what I was looking for. It's really funny to me to see how one of the most talked-about things in US history is a few drops of water in the bucket for Britain's long and complicated history. I never knew that Britain benefited from the loss of the colonies- that's real interesting stuff. Thanks again!
Would be odd to be a test but I'd own up anyway.

I got most of it through working in an already well paid job, which paid overtime at a minimum of time + a half, &amp; doing 12-15 hours extra a week, on a regular basis, to prevent me from having to go home &amp; be alone with my thoughts whilst I was horrendously depressed.

I'm better now after years of therapy and medication but still live like something of a frugal hermit so I still manage to save.

I would absolutely trade the money to get those years back now I'm more mentally healthy &amp; aware of myself.

"Might want to point out that if they're pointing it upwards and outdoors, any pilots reporting being dazzled would lead to a swift and public response."
I think this is the most sensible answer. Fighting back with your own laser will only egg on the little shite.  Complaining directly to the parents about him might put them on the defensive. But if you say you're *concerned* about timmy getting into trouble dazzling pilots when he's shining his laser willy nilly it'll make the parents think you're on their side and more likely to get the knob to stop.

Decolonisation is looked at yes. But that's a 20th century thing. Britain's empire got bigger post US revolution so that isn't relevant to decolonisation. Shockingly our history lessons aren't about wanking ourselves off to former colonial atrocity.

"We looked at the US in the context of the slave trade and the great depression since those fundamentally affected us. We don't generally study the revolution simply because it didn't change much for our country at the time, there wasn't a change in the life of the ordinary brit. Our studies would generally focus more on our constant wars with the rest of Europe. 

Far too much history with too little time to fit it all in.

"There's actually very little in our history teaching about ever being the most powerful nation.

Because, as my other comment says, our history is angled towards an earlier timespan, we more often are taught about being NOT powerful compared to the Roman Empire, or France  or Imperial Spain.

A lot of our history (like yours in your world view!) starts with beginnings/ origins. By the time we get to the period of Empire, we've kind of lost interest in school."

"I'm 24 and my boyfriend is 28. We had £30k, then we bought a house, now we're broke. It's like now that we don't have a goal to save towards we don't have any motivation to put money away. I'd guess we have about £2.5k between us. Our mission for this year is to build an emergency fund and then to pay off his high interest car finance and to overpay the mortgage as much as possible, get our debt down. Finances are hard."
"Legally they're within their rights to get the money back, so you ultimately did the right thing for yourself at least - Some people end up spending the extra, then the company ask for it back - and affairs move to the courts...

In the meantime consider sticking the extra in a high-interest savings account, if you've got one."
"It's how long our history is that is the problem.

So never mind the decline of Empire, even Empire itself might not be studied. 

First of all, there is quite a strong domestic focus on the history we study, and then, if we look abroad, there is European history, often before there is history about any of the rest of the world.

No-one studies the whole of British history; not even people who do history at university can cover all of it in detail.

When I was at school, I was 15 before I did ANY history more recent than about 1650. Even when I studied the period 1700-1900 it was 99% in the context of Britain and Europe.

I knew much more about the Angevin Empire, and Napoleon's Empire, and Bismarck, than I did about anything outside Europe.

Look, the founding story of any country is really important- so for you, the Revolutionary War IS really important. But our founding story may be a story around 1642-7, or around 1485 or 1066 or even around 800.

It's not that we gloss over the American Revolution or want to forget it; it's just that our world view is INDEED that of an island, and that's how we've always grown up thinking about our history. 'World history' is something a bit different for us.

"
Also let's be fair there have been dozens of Independance struggles Britain has had to deal with... 
"*war of independence.

ok- for perspective- our history goes back a least 2000 years. we still have roman remans everywhere.

at the time of that war, we were also at war with france, who live just a few miles off our coast. Don't recall learning about either. like i said- we have a lot of history! we just cover the major events... (which we dont really regard that as... pivotal for you, not for us...)

"Bear in mind I'm not a historian so do take what I've said with a pinch of salt. Economies are complicated things and I have somewhat simplified things to the extreme.

It was a humiliation, but Britain did not really mourn the loss. Prior to the war, Britain's imperialist policy moreso focused on controlling trade through pure ownership which put both strain on naval and military resources. Many desired to reign in this tight grip.

Adam Smith with his *'Wealth of Nations'* in 1790 largely inspired a more Laissz-Faire attitude to overseas trade, and Britain's imperialist policies immediately following the War of Independence largely moved towards free-market capitalism. Without the burden of enforcing trade rights in a costly manner, Britain was able to flourish financially."

"I work for Royal Mail. Let me put it this way..the more you do for them the more they expect you to do. The job itself is not difficult but the vast majority of managers I have come across whilst working for them have been complete dickheads. From the get go stand your ground and don’t let them pressure you into taking overtime. You won’t be expected to do it apart from around the Christmas period. But make sure to take note of all overtime you do as they have a bad habit of not paying out on time. You may be asked to start earlier to help with prep in the morning which is a good way to make an extra few hours pay. The best shoes I’d say are trainers, they provide you with shoes but they’re so heavy and clunky it makes it difficult to do a full duty in them. Be prepared to have your feet basically fucked up in the first few months. "

"It sounds like something that talking to a therapist about would really help. Having a professional who is trained to talk about this stuff in an honest and open way can be really useful for you, and help you deal with the feelings you're experiencing.

Having traumatic experiences during childhood can have a big impact on your life, and often contributes to mental health problems like anxiety, depression, PTSD, drug use and other unhealthy coping strategies. You sound like you're a really strong person, but having someone to talk to means you don't have to cope on your own.

[Have a read about counselling / therapy with the NHS here](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/free-therapy-or-counselling/)

Some schools, and I think all universities have free counselling services that you can go to.

You can talk to your GP, or self-refer to services. (Although waiting list is probably long). 

I feel a GP would have a lot more discretion than teachers when it comes to disclosing things to police / social services as they have a duty of confidentiality even if you are under 16. (See Gillick Competence). If you say you don't want to get police involved, and there's no evidence of your other siblings being at risk then they may not have to disclose."
"Wait, gamestop still operates in the UK? I haven't seen one in years  thought they'd already gone under. (Unless they've simply pulled out of our country.)

CEX beats them for preowned prices and selection in my experience, and I can pre-order and download games online. I personally can't see how they're adding value, and rent for shop units is insanely high. A real shame, but that's business no matter what's being sold, look at HMV, House of Fraser, BHS.

"Social media balkanisation is definitely part of it - no matter how you try, *the algorithm* inexorably provides you with content that matches your extant opinions (stuff you 'like' or 'retweet' or whatever), and this creates a smaller and smaller bubble for us each to inhabit - continually surrounded by people who reinforce our beliefs, no matter how batshit. 

Which means that when we're confronted with anything or anyone who disagrees, they're not just disagreeing with us, they're disagreeing with **reality** and **common sense**... 

Brexit gets the blame for a lot of this, but really it's the campaigning around Brexit that's to fault (which again, was chiefly conducted on and around social media - so feeding back into the balkanisation loop). 

And for a while traditional media has been trying to cash in on the same dynamic - because deliberately appealing to a niche base of highly engaged extremists (often by **deliberately pissing them off** with controversial headlines (or 'outright lies')) is the most profitable way to operate. 

(this applies on left and right alike - the business model of The Canary, Guido, The Express and the Guardian is identical)

It does feel like there's been a concerted effort to create a nation of extremists - especially with the current demonisation of 'centrists' from various factions. 

(also people are just a bit worried about the future - whatever you think of Brexit, we just **don't know** what it means, which is scary. We don't know what is going to happen to our economy - and thus our jobs, homes, livelihoods etc. 

Scared people have short tempers. Especially if they're trying to act like they aren't scared.)"
"I didn't realise it but apparently I say bollocks *all* the time. Anyway, I had a German ex and before we met, she spoke very fluent English but with a US phrasing. After we got together, she started to adopt some of my dialect and mannerisms and before long, she sounded like a manc doing an American accent.

Anyway, she came home from work one day and said that she had given a presentation and at some point everyone fell about laughing in a manner she thought was inappropriate. Basically turned out she had said that some method for doing x was 'total bollocks' thinking that if not quite a scientific term was at least a formal one. I don't think she realised till that night that bollocks meant balls... think she thought it literally meant rubbish.

History in UK schools starts waaay before 1776, think Stone Age, Iron Age, Ancient Egyptians, Roman Empire, Battle of Hastings, Magna Carta, Tudors, Stewarts, Queen Elizabeth, Walter Raleigh, Captain Cook etc. American History is like a different subject you can study later on."

"&gt; I would be scared if one person had that much power at their hands and nothing to stop them from doing what they feel like to anytime.

See, that's your mistake. The Queen reigns; she does not rule. She has no power to change anything of importance in British life.

It's pretty much the foundation of the modern British constitution that Parliament is supreme and the Monarch is subservient to Parliament. Although almost everything done by Parliament or the Courts is done ""in the name of Her Majesty"" the orders are not coming from the Queen herself, in fact it's the other way round and most of the important things the Queen does are ordered (strictly speaking, ""suggested/recommended"") by the Prime Minister.

On paper the Queen has quite a lot of powers, but she is unable to use them unilaterally. The last time a King tried to seriously go against the wishes of Parliament was over 300 years ago, and that was dealt with by forcing him into permanent exile and a new, more compliant monarch brought in to replace him. Every King or Queen since has been thoroughly aware of this, and none has ever tried to seriously rock the boat since."
