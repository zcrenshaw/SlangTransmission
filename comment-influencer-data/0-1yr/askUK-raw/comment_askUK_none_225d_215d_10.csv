"As others have said, a degree in any social sciences or social care can be a direct route into working with these groups of individuals. But you don't need a degree to secure any of these jobs. Some college courses such as a HNC in social care would gear you up for these types of jobs.

If you don't want to do either of these, you could volunteer at an outreach program or an organisation who deals primarily with these types of service users. I would recommend a local food bank, a lot of the people who access food banks are facing issues such as addiction, homelessness  or conviction issues. You don't just had out food, you provide extremely valuable support and guidence to those who have nowhere else to go. 

Working with people who have convictions could be tricky, unless it's something to do with helping them with employability or integrating back into society. You're looking at more experienced support workers and a full disclosure. 

Local CAB could be good, however you won't be in contact with the types of service users that often. Unless you found a CAB that does direct outreach to those types of service users. 

Victim support might be a good place to start, same with shelter.

"My daughter is 7. The kids that are shouting are aged between 4 - 9. 

My husband went out and shouted at the kids at the end of the driveway, and that was when the parents appeared. ""Who are you to shout at my kids,"" ""It's always my kids that get the blame,"" etc etc, and I'm at a loss on how to deal with parents like that. Whenever we try to speak to them, it's like their child can do no wrong where as mine is the devil. When I spoke to my daughter, she admitted that she'd hit back after she'd been hit by others, which I shut down immediately and hasn't happened since. Apparently she'd also been hit by one of the 4 year olds, who gets no discipline because she's ""only 4."" I mean, how do you defend against that? Especially when the kids know they're not going to be punished by their parents, so they start again straight away?"

"tl;dr to what follows is 'Be careful.' 

I am with British Gas, I have one of those bloody first generation smart meters and I'd lose that functionality if I change supplier. I actually really like the fact I have a smart meter, so that weighs with me.

Actually, I've been pretty happy with BG,and as I'm only paying ¬£500 a year for 2 people in a 4 bed house + heated conservatory, I can't complain.

If you really save ¬£116 a year, that's big. But I am also suspicious of comparison websites- they often skew the comparison in favour of switching- when your existing tariff runs out, they do not always give you the best result for your EXISTING supplier going forward, so it always looks better if you switch, but IRL you may save nothing or very little. Also, as one answer already says, if your small supplier goes bust, you'll get no electric credit.

Even Martin Lewis recommends that your basic strategy should be always to check you are n the best tariff for your existing supplier (because there's never a penalty to leave your tariff for another one from the same supplier).

If you can, and can be bothered, do your comparison from scratch. Take your usage and use your consumption figures (easy to work out given the smart meter gives you nice graphs and stuff online) to do your own sums.

Now, the other thing is that for most people, the usage on heating determines how much you use overall. So your calculation is always on your current usage, but you cannot tell how warm orcold next winter will be.

Looking at my figures over the last 3 years, I can easily see that whether it was mild or cold over the winter mattered much more than my tariff.

"There is no deadline, I know they state 1 month from the letter. But you have longer to appeal.

If confusion is one of your symptoms, this is a good reason that you are now sending in the reconsideration letters late. 'I accidentally sent them to the wrong address'. As long as you don't wait months this should be enough of a reason for them to extend your reconsideration time. Send any proof you have as this is the reason.

Since your waiting for them to call back, this might be Monday as they close around 6pm.

Just wait for what they say.

If they say 'We can't find your letters', then ask for an extension and if you can send the letters again and/or copies of documents you might have sent before (that you can't reproduce).

If they say you sent it to the wrong place, then just come clean and say you where confused and if you can send it in again.

Be nice, call early if they don't call back, these people have some really crazy people on the lines and it's nice when someone is civil and not abusive, they like to work with people like that and stay on the line until it's sorted. better to deal with the nice person then the crazy angry one that's been on hold for ages!

"Did a two year Journalism and Media Production foundation degree at Huddersfield Uni's Barnsley Campus  in 2007 following a geographical change in living situation and finding it difficult to get a job that paid as well as my previous one. I was 34, married and a home owner. I went full time, took out a student loan, applied for mature student bursaries and  worked in a 7 hour a week part time job in the university library  using my existing work skills and experience.  

I enjoyed studying  so much I did a third year and completed an honours degree in Television Production and Media. By the time I graduated, I'd separated from my first wife,  sold my house and relocated to the East Midlands intent on doing a Masters. But then there was a general election, the other lot got in, the economy crashed, the cost of adult education became prohibitive and so I had to give up on my dreams of further study, making an independently produced documentary and get a real job by going back into full time work. 

Whilst I've used the academic skills and knowledge in my current job, I did find it difficult to find a graduate role following graduation as most employers seemed shocked when a 37 year old graduate rocks up for an interview. Do I regret doing it? Hell no! Because being a mature student is awesome fun and educational not only for yourself but for your fellow students.  Especially as I did the degree I wanted to do in a subject I was interested in and not solely for a career in Television Production, though that would have been nice. ¬£30k well spent.

"Back in my airport ramp rat days, I was once towing a fully fueled GV (worth $45 million or so) a little too fast and when I took a 30 degree turn to line her up for parking she kept going forward, pushing the tug and myself sideways and perpendicular to her until the $8,000 tow bar snapped.  I then had the GV's leading edge coming right for the tug but I managed to reverse the tug quickly out of the way.  I snagged a couple of chocks off the tug and proceeded to throw one under the front tire as it was careening towards a hangar.  The aircraft jumped over the chock but it had slowed down considerably enough to throw the second chock under and stop it with about 25 feet to spare.  I was a pretty good worker so fessed up.  Despite ruining the tow bar the GV was ok, so I got a slight ass slap but got off otherwise."

"Well, if you are going to cock up at work, you should make a *really* good job of it.

I may have helped put a national firm under to the tune of several million, and cost several thousand people their jobs.

It was 1997. I just started with a firm called ANC parcels. At the time, they were doing well, and all of their depots were individual franchise businesses.

So one day, I go to collect a few parcels from the local Tesco. We had a contract with them nationally, but I cannot remember for the life of me what they were shipping.

That morning I got there, it just so happened that a regional manager was in, and he cornered me about why a lot of parcels had been turning up late or damaged or often, both. It had been costing them, it seems, a lot of money, and ANC were being lazy about compensating them. 

I made an off hand comment to this senior manager about the ANC employees being tired, underpaid and just a lack of overall QA being done between the depots and hubs leading to parcel often being used as footballs in depot. 

This comment it seems, went all the way to the top, who sent further people out to investigate deeper. When the investigation turned out to be not so far from the truth, Tesco suspended ANC's national contract, costing them over a million pounds in lost business. Our local franchise owner was stripped of her franchise, but not before I had a major bollocking and got written up for it.  I left after that, but before she lost the franchise, and went to another parcel firm (City Link.....That franchise *also* went under 3 months after I finished there.....).

You may recall that eventually ANC was bought out by Fed Ex, but it seems my careless mouth may have set the whole thing in motion.

"If you have received a piece of paper from DWP headed in bold letters 'Mandatory Reconsideration' and sent it to the wrong place, do you have a copy of it?  If not, ask them to send you another one because you need it.  You can do that by phone, don't wait for them to phone you, be proactive.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have a mandatory reconsideration notice, then you need to fill in a form SSC1, which you can find online, asking for an appeal and send it \*with the Mandatory Reconsideration notice\* to the Tribunals Service (at the address given on that form) which is completely separate from DWP.  If you have missed the deadline you will have to explain on the form why your appeal is late, but don't panic about that, the Tribunals Service will almost certainly allow a late appeal.  A couple of weeks or so isn't that much, and you can explain what went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously, do get proper advice.  Without seeing the paperwork, anyone on the internet could be wrong about what stage you are at.  But it all sounds so recent, you are probably going to be able to get this back on track.  If you get your appeal request accepted, you will get all of the necessary paperwork about the decision sent to you so don't worry about that.  And ask to have a hearing where you go along and they can talk to you, you are much more likely to win an appeal if you do.       "

Definitely not, made friends, made new business like connections, have a disability and am now taken more seriously I find.

"It's not *per* 6 hours, it's 20 minutes if your shift is over 6 hours. Even on a 12 hour shift, minimum is still only 20. "
I want to see one using pounds coins. It'd be so extravagant.
"No problemo, about the only time I can bring my Genetics degree knowledge to use is online these days"
"We did home ec at school but I think they went overkill trying to make us produce swiss rolls and upside-down pineapple cakes - rather than ""How to make an omelet/poached eggs"", ""How to cook rice"". 

Compound interest was in Maths class. No mention of cheques (You're American I assume from your spelling) since they aren't really a thing in the UK anymore. Mortgages would have been useful, but a good read of the [MSE website](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-guide/) will teach you all you need to know."

"I know a few former teachers. The fact that they're former teachers should be warning enough, given the training and qualifications that go into it.

It's a shitload of paperwork, marking and planning. No time for a life, because you're up until 10pm every day working. And the pay is crap. 

This country does not care about educating its youth."

"I started a full-time access course after being made redundant when I was 24. I did ok and in gave me a start back into education. Ended up having to start working full-time in the final 3 months of the course (possibly the most stressed I've ever been). My plan was to start an OU degree in Comp Sci after the course however I ended up picking a distance learning degree offered by Uni of Hertfordshire instead. Only 2 years in at this point but really enjoyed it so far and it has been everything I expected/hoped. 

You appear to be being realistic with your goals but I can't emphasize enough how big a commitment it is. When I first started I had the mindset that ""of course I'll do 3 hours every day, I want to change my life"" but when you've got in from a long day and you just want to sit and watch Netflix, sitting down and doing work will seem like an impossible task. 

It's definitely helped me so far, developed a lot of skills I wouldn't have otherwise. Not where I want to be in my career yet but confident that by the time I finish I'll be able to get where I want to go."
Can't go wrong with double g and t

"In terms of the fitting of the kitchen provided by IKEA, I presume you are paying IKEA who are then effectively 'outsourcing' the fitting to these contractors? If that's the case, then IKEA (as the principal in this contract) have a responsibility for the actions of their agents and sub-contractors. If there is an issue with the work that is included in your contract with IKEA, it is their issue to resolve it. 

In terms of your seperate arrangement with the fitters for additional work, that is up to you to negotiate the terms and it is not IKEA's place to insist on how you pay them. I personally wouldn't pay 100% up-front to any tradesman and would instead work on a % up front + % on completion. They aren't quoting you a price ""for cash"" by any chance are they? "
"I think it's probably closer to 68-70 hours a week, as Tuesday sometimes ends a bit earlier. But yeah, I hadn't added it all together, it is quite crazy (especially as my commute is just over an hour, so that adds another two hours+ to the day). And it really is virtually all standing up (and going up and down stairs too), by the third day day in a row my feet were really hurting, the fourth and fifth days in a row were even worse."
