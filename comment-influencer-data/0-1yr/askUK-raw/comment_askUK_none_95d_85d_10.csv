"Christ there's so much wrong here. Under min wage, massively excessive hours, illegal shift patterns (11 hours min between shifts). You are being exploited, I can't get that across clearly enough."
"They need to give 24 hour notice and even then I think you are within your right to refuse until a more convenient time unless theres a serious problem.

You need to nip this in the bud ASAP or they'll take the absoute piss as long as you're renting the apartment.

Did you get some kind of evidence that the electrician was there? It might be worth going to citizen advice and asking them for some help dealing with it. Also, if the estate agents are being funny ask to speak to their head office and raise the fact that they're handing out keys to your apartment without permission. If you hadn't been there and they were hiring people without creditation you could end up getting robbed. THis is terrible but frankly not suprising, estate agents are usually awful to deal with and take such liberties frequently, then they try and take as much money from you in the end as well.

Its drastic, but if it happens again ring 111 and say theres someone in the house you didn't sanction."
"Part of my job involves supplying building materials to the construction/building industry. Most of the buyers I deal with are very cost-centered and will shop around for the best price. If we aren't competitive, we won't win the tender/sale.  
  
The NHS and the local Council are an exception. I've never had a quote challenged by their buying departments. Ever. I'm convinced that the buying departments are one of the biggest contributors to the financial pressures the NHS are currently facing. We make an absolute fortune from them."
"I would consider Clement Atlee and the post war Labour government to be one of the best the UK has had. They founded the NHS and implemented social welfare that was and still is even considering the Tory cuts the most comprehensive the UK has ever seen.

"If you ever see a national grid engineer, there’s about a 1 in 10 chance that he’s called Paul. I did a search in the field force employee directory once, and about 10% of them were named Paul.

That final one is so annoying. When I finish at midnight (which is most days) I still have a 45 minute/1 hour journey home (because the trains have nearly always stopped by the time I finish). Then it takes me around 30-45 minutes to get into work the next day. So it means I have long lie-ins on my days off to recover!

"I get it. I’m late 20s and I can’t help but compare my life to everyone else my age. I haven’t got a career, a nice car or even a deposit for a house. 

Everyone had just massive expectations that not everyone else can live up to. 

Like buying a house, my Greek friend informed me that no one owns property over there unless you’re rich and it’s normal, yet apparently you’ve failed in life in the UK if you’re in your 40s or 50s and don’t own a property. 

I haven’t got a degree and even though I’m a hard worker, getting a career this day and at my age is near impossible.

All I do to try and get by is changing the goal posts. Yes, I still don’t have a career but I saved up enough for a small holiday. I still have no deposit for a house but I got a new chair and footstool I’ve been wanting for months now. The smaller things are making me happy because I’m trying to not focus on the bigger things."
"My brother works for a self storage facility. Those letters you get when they increase your rent citing ""we have tried to absorb as many of these increased costs as possible"" or something similar... all bullshit. They do it because they can and they know their customers generally can't be arsed to move their stuff out until they need to.

"OP if this is a high-profile restaurant, it would be amazing if you take this to a newspaper and oust them for these practices."
"Various supermarkets:  
  
* Standards for keeping chilled/frozen stuff at temperature vary quite a lot from chain to chain and location to location. Hopefully EHO and food standards agency bake in a fair margin of 'this won't be kept to religiously' into their standards for safety.  
* In-store bakeries. Some (usually the biggest stores) are scratch bakeries where people use actual skill to turn raw ingredients into loaves and rolls and doughnuts and things. Others, everything is part-baked and frozen, comes in and goes into ovens where everything just runs to an automated program. There is quite a big difference in quality but they'll never market the proper bakeries in a way that they really could and should, because to do so will throw the smaller bakeries under the bus.  
* Date rotation is no secret. Yes, short dates go at the front. Yes we know some of you dig to the back to get longer dates. I do it too. We don't particularly care so long as you're not leaving shit all over the floor. People who dump chilled stuff in freezers or frozen stuff on ambient shelving are an *actual* problem.  
* We don't care what you're buying or judge you for it. We only judge people who add hassle to our day."
"Definitely agree with logging everything.

Also, invest in a cheap gazebo, position it so that you have an area where you can sit under the gazebo out his view. If you enjoy sunshine and you're clever, it's probably possible to do that in such a way you can still enjoy the sun.

Equally, put up posts in your garden and tie a screen to them to block his view of other parts of the garden. So long as they're temporary, the council shouldn't have a problem with that.

I think the thing that worries me most is your daughter. As adults, we can accept that there's a creepy guy next door, and although we may not like it, for the most part we are able to carry on with our lives. Teenagers often aren't able to do that. She may feel unable to enjoy using her trampoline. After that, relaxing in the garden with her friends might become uncomfortable. Then she'll not want to be in the garden with you or the family. And before too long, she's unahppy even being in the house, and there's no escape from the way the creepy dude interferes with her life. Please talk to her regularly. Also, keep her school informed, and ask them to look for signs of changes in behaviour.

Good luck!"

"Anyone else feel like full time work just eats up all of your time? By the time I get home from work, make dinner, do a couple of chores all I want to do is flop in bed and watch a few episodes of something before going to sleep. On the weekend the weight of all the longer, more time consuming chores hits... so by the time Monday rolls back round I feel like I didn't even get a break. I bought a couple of games from the steam summer sale yesterday and I feel like I should just get a refund on most of them because I probably won't even have time to play."

"I've now worked at four Michelin star restaurants in the UK (some for not long because of abusive behaviour from higher-up chefs) and each is roughly the same in terms of pay and hours (at least 15 hour days, rarely having breaks). I just asked about the current place because I read an article about a famous restaurant in Australia that was exposed for paying below minimum wage, so I actually did calculations to figure my pay out."
"They've done a lot to take a lot of the salt and fat and things out - it looks bad on the traffic light labels otherwise. Whereas I'm sure the takeaway stuff has truckloads of salt and ghee, because no-one's really clamped down on that or made them declare it."
"In the UK if arrested and being questioned by the Police you are entitled to free and independent legal advice. This can only be delayed with the authority of a very senior Police officer - and must be documented &amp; justifiable; delaying free legal advice is very rare.

On arrival, the Solicitor is entitled to a briefing from the Police on what is known/suspected and what evidence is currently available to them. This process is known as 'Advance Disclosure'. The Solicitor will then have a private consultation with you (and get the Legal Aid forms signed). With knowledge of the account from the Police and you, the Solicitor can then advise you how to proceed. You are entitled to have the Solicitor present during all interviews.If you choose not to request free legal advice at the start, you can change your mind at any time and the interview must be paused until you've received free and independent legal advice.

"Ex police here whose conducted interviews - people already covered the fact you're entitled to a free solicitor and yeah saying nothing is totally fine too. So I'll add a few things you might find interesting.

Yes the police were almost certainly trying to get your friend to talk along certain pre-planned lines. During interview they are thinking about the long game, will this get by CPS, and if it does how can I make this interview solid for court. This does *not* mean they were pushing for lies (although if somebody is lying out of their arse it is useful to make them draw those lies out - the deeper and more complex they make the bullshit the easier it is to disprove those lies in court). So - they will be asking questions that help them tick boxes to prove a specific offence. Say I stole a bike - as part of the definition of they gotta prove that I took it *dishonestly*, with the *intention* of *permanently depriving* the owner of that object. So their questions will be pushing me to admit to things that hit those markers. 'Why did you take it?' 'why did you take it at night?' 'what were you gonna do with it?' 'where is it now?' Other questions will seek to preemptively wreck future defense claims. A defense to theft would be you had permission to take it, or you were only temporarily borrowing it. This is where you get questions like 'did you ask if you could take it? why not?', 'why did you have bolt cutters on you?' etc. These also help to prove the dishonest bit of the offence, but also establish a narrative where you took it at night, with bolt cutters, and you didn't ask - nobody borrowing a thing would do that shit. 

Sorry if this is a bit garbled - It's been like 10 years, I forgot a lot and I image a lot has changed since I was doing interviews."
"MOD are the same in terms of buying for more than they should, maybe its a government thing?"
"When I worked at Waitrose about 5 years ago, each employee had around £10 of 'free stuff credit' they could give out each week. For example, if someone was dithering about a different brand because we didn't have the one they asked for, you could let them ""try it for free"". I didn't get to use it much because I worked in the cafe, but I did give out a few cakes. It was pretty fun. I don't know if this still applies, but look concerned in a Waitrose store whilst holding an item you don't want to pay for and see what happens."
Yep. I joke to myself sometimes that one small table is paying my weekly wage in one meal.

Doesn’t help that contractors have a base price and the moment they see MOD they add zeros onto the cost of things. For example i’m serving a force that policies the air space of the UK (hope you get that) and for a certain type of bulb it costs £2.47 from an online retailer... the cost to the MOD? £84.32.

"I think you're reading too much into the fact that we have an established church, the same way Americans often see the NHS as some sort of arm of government.

The effect of the establishment of religion is that we just don't care about it. We all (unless our parents opt us out) have to sit down for prayers in school, the Queen is appointed in God's name, there are ancient ""official"" churches everywhere you look. But even Anglicans don't really feel like their church is An Arm Of The State. Our ""state church"", even in the 70s, has and had nothing like the pervasiveness of the American church. 

It's the same for the BBC, FWIW, although that's changing. Life of Brian was an immensely controversial film at the time. All the BBC did was put two Pythons up against two representatives of Christianity to debate (Muggeridge was a Catholic, not part of the established church). They weren't responsible for the bishop's behaviour."
"Restricted in what way?

I once went into huge profit in Paddy Power because I used to be very clued up on mma fighting.

Meanwhile they're more than happy to take tonnes of cash from people repeatedly losing month on month. It's so unethical."
honestly the easiest way to prevent this from happening is to change the locks. as long as you put the originals back in before you move out its fine. it'll annoy the estate agent for sure but only because it forces them to actually do their job and make arrangements with you about who will be in your home.

"Well, I did - a couple of weeks ago!  I was walking along a main road which had slow moving traffic approaching a set of lights.  There was a lady in a big black car (BMW 7 Series kind of size) and she had the windscreen wipers going - which was weird, because it wasn't raining and she'd not squirted the windscreen wash.

It drew my attention because there was what looked like a bit of rubbish stuck on the wiper blade near where the tax disc holder would've gone - so in the corner opposite from her position in the driver's seat.  The traffic was stopped at the lights, so I motioned to suggest I could lift off the rubbish: she stopped the wiper going, I picked it off, and she motioned her gratitude. I thought nice - now I've got some sticky rubbish in my hand, what do I do: I'm not going to drop it - so I stood by the door and suggested she wind down the window.  She didn't want to, central-locked the doors, and crept forward even though there was nowhere to drive to.

I got the message: single woman stuck in a car, doesn't want to open the window to a big bloke - even though it was a busy street, I was smartly dressed, and clearly only wanted to give her the rubbish. No problem.  Except that as I walked along, I looked at the rubbish and saw that it was a parking ticket.  She'd booted it from the lights and was long gone."

"I benefited from going to a public School, not a great deal to be honest. I would rather there weren't any private schools and the money put back everyone's education. If rich kids have to go to the same school as everyone else they would never let the schools deteriorate too far. It's a pipe dream but I believe that is the model in Finland. Extra benefits would probably include improved social mobility."

"I used to work in the warehouse for a factory that manufactured seals and gaskets, and they supplied a lot to the MOD. 

Now I'm not saying they're not getting fleeced (because they probably are), but part of that cost will be because the MOD is willing to pay that much for a part that absolutely will not fail. We used to supply O-Rings to the company who manufactured ejection seats for jets. That same O-ring could possibly be sold to another company for 10% of the price, but without the same level of quality checks and guarantees."
"Thanks for the advice guys. This definitely was not emergency work being carried out, he was just here to check the fuses and set the fire alarms off to make sure they're working. But the stupid thing is, the estate agents themselves turned up yesterday unnanounced, I let them in, and they checked the boiler and the fire alarms yesterday and didn't mention anything about an electrician coming today. I'm gonna go and install a chain in the door to stop this happening again . The estate agent claimed that they texted me to tell us he was coming, I asked them to give my mobile number and the had the last digit wrong, which makes no sense as they've text me on the correct number multiple times in the past."

100% is.  I spent an autumn/winter in Sydney a few years ago and was happily swimming in the sea when locals were giving me the side-eye and bundled up in thick hoodies.

It's not just the temperature, it's the rain and wind.  Get yourself a really, really good set of wind &amp; waterproof outer layers.

"This hits home for me. I had a breakdown last Sunday and was writing my suicide letter. Since then I went to my local surgery and spoke to a volunteer for mental health support and also saw a GP on the same day.

Being mildly disabled and having a long term medical problem is demoralising as well. I don't even know what makes me happy at the moment, so it's becoming difficult to carry on living."
That sounds like the type of thing Wetherspoons head office would say.

Lastly, this low number meant that a lock could be placed in the ""3"" space on a rotary dial to disable it but still allow emergency calls to be made."

It's entirely up to you what approach you take - using a prop might help, e.g. ""Sorry but I don't want to chat, I'm reading my book/reading my emails/listening to a podcast"", but tbh you have the right to just say ""I understand you want to chat but I'm not comfortable talking to strangers, please leave me alone"".

If he takes offense at this that is 100% his problem, not yours.  No one has a right to your attention. You are not obliged to make yourself uncomfortable for someone who doesn't respect you enough to leave you alone."
"I mean it's a difficult question because you can define ""good"" in many ways. Even Thatcher, someone I disagree with a lot, arguably achieved a lot during her time as PM, some of it good, a lot of it bad in my mind, but to her supporters amazing.

I'm also going to consider the question of ""Who do you consider to be a good \*contemporary\* Prime Minister?"". Our system is very old and there are plenty of examples of successful or forward thinking Prime Ministers, but if I for example picked Pitt the Younger, I don't think that's what you're looking for.

I think the two Prime Ministers that have, if you're trying to be objective, implemented the most change in the country that they wanted to see changed recently it's Thatcher and Blair. Thatcher is given too much credit for ""creating"" Blair, but the reality is world wide the trend towards free markets and away from controlled economies is pretty much universal, with even China following it. The fact Blair didn't want to nationalise everything isn't Thatcher's credit. Thatcher radically overhauled the economy, and Blair radically overhauled the constitution and pumped huge amounts into the public sector. In terms of stats there are loads, but it's important to remember people's priorities are different, so me saying Blair is better because he did more for the poor is ultimately a personal call.

Both of these Prime Ministers not only achieved a lot of change, but they also won multiple elections, which lets face it is the main job of the party leader. Thatcher of course being the first and only woman to  ever win a majority in a general election in the UK even with May's premiership.

With those two out of the way you need to go back to Celement Atlee to find such a huge overhaul of what it is like to live in Britain. Atlee's legacy is obvious and the scale of change huge, but as a Prime Minister himself he was very quiet and unassuming, and the context of WW2 helped his agenda massively. It's also interesting that, at the time, he was seen as being in the middle of Labour, neither on the left nor the right of the party. If you want to see what the radical hard left looked like in 1945, look at Nye Bevan, the guy who largely set up the NHS. However, Atlee wasn't in government long before Churchill was re-elected as PM. All governments go through ups and downs and no one stays in charge forever, so I don't massively see this as Atlee's fault or anything, particularly when he was standing against a literal war hero.

Speaking of Churchill, he of course was very much the right Prime Minister for WW2. His connection with the US and his general attitude was exactly what was needed in the country's darkest hour. That said, while he did prevent the country from being crushed at the hands of the Third Reich, he was a terrible peace time Prime Minister. His achievements during the war are one of the few reasons he is remembered fondly today, if you took that away and just left the rest on his own, he'd be terrible.

So Blair, Thatcher, Atlee, Churchill are the contemporary PMs that have contributed the most to shape Britain as it is today in my view, based off domestic policy.

One of the leaders that I think will be remembered as a ""good"" PM in the right sort of history books, but not by the public, was Gordon Brown. He was an awful UK PM, he doesn't have the charisma or leadership abilities to lead in Parliament and the country in the 24 hour news cycle. He'd have been amazing 30 years prior, but not 10 years ago. That said, he was fiercely intelligent and a lot more socialist at heart than he gets credit for, and he really was a key figure leading Europe in the GFC. In terms of impact on the world stage I would actually put him second after Churchill in terms of contemporary Prime Ministers.

So I guess my final answer is Blair, Thatcher, Atlee, and Churchill all shaped Britain into what it is today, and Brown gets an honourable mention for his impact abroad even though he was ineffective at home."

"So £1916/monthly.

Let's consider a 28 day month.

And every 28 days you're working 20 days, 16 at 15 hours (let's assume 15 to account for a 20 minute unpaid break) and 4 at 7 hours (same logic.)

That's 16\*15 + 4\*7 = 268.

1916/268=£7.14/hour

Min wage is £8.21 so an underpayment of £1.07 hour for 268 hours  is £287 per month."
"It's a bit of a myth, in modern times at least, I think, that the British drink tea instead of coffee. I'd say we drink both, and have done for years, but in different settings. And the 'coffee-drinking-setting' is a growth market, and a market that is capable of growing.

But people drink tea at home, and in their  office. But paying the same price for a cup of tea as you pay for a fancy coffee at a trendy coffee shop  - the tea the British like is just too basic, it doesn't lend itself to fancy brews and syrups or novelty.

Tearooms - they were huge in the 1930s. They just have not been a fashionable  thing since, even the newer trendy ones are more about cakes, and places where mums meet up."
"I'm glad the top reply here isn't some ""no, automatic is shit, do manual"" circlejerk here. I forgot which UK sub I've seen it in before but the general arguments I see are ""automatic is lazy"", ""it's LESS FUN TO DRIVE"", ""better fuel efficiency"" and ""renting abroad might be a hassle"".

The last one is the only valid argument (the fuel efficiency increase is a very marginal amount) and it's very specific/not a necessity for a good amount of people."
"There's definitely a common theme in the UK of ""this seems that way but in practice really isn't"" which covers everything from the Queen to the BBC and Church of England. That leads to people on the outside getting reading too much into it and getting the wrong idea"
I use the met office app. The app is fine but the widget has a nasty habit of refusing to update.

"Private school people always like to make out it made no difference but they have no idea what is like at state school.

How many kids bring knives in at private schools?

"The grass is always greener on the other side really rings true here. 

I've managed to achieve the things that you've mentioned - I have a secure career and recently bought a house. But all that has come with constantly limiting myself, never really being able to enjoy anything or treat myself because of this ridiculous race to the property ladder that gets instilled in us.

I definitely feel like I've missed out on life a bit over the last couple of years. Everyone my age is always on holiday, going out in the evenings and filling their time with fun activities, and they think it's crazy that I've managed to buy a house. I on the other hand think it's crazy that they're living life and having fun every day but I forfeited that to instead now have a 25 year responsibility on my shoulders. Don't get me wrong, I feel lucky to have it, but I think as people we always compare ourselves to others and we never quite measure up."

"For completeness:

999 or 112 is for emergencies (police, ambulance, fire, mountain rescue, coastguard, cave rescue, etc.)

101 is for police non-emergencies

111 is for medical advice

Yes. I like to pretend I'm an American hobo on a freight train.

"The signs were there for a while so you could prepare, and park your car outside of the closed area. 

If you failed to plan for a 2 hour inconvenience, that's just on you."
"Tell you what the problem is here: it’s the word ‘river’. Drunk kids and water is very bad indeed. At about 20, one of my mates got dragged out, seconds from drowning. Another mate of mine broke his fucking neck diving into the sea pissed. About a decade ago a lad got up from the pub table next to mine, went to swim across the river on a dare. Disappeared. River was about 10m wide and only 2 metres deep. 

I’m fine with kids getting pissed. But not near the water."
"Also more expensive if you need to hire a car (except in some places overseas, like the US, where everything is automatic)."
"I posted to legaladvice, was told by someone else to ring 101. So just did that and they were very unsympathatetic and said ""you cant stop people looking out their window"". Well, no shit."

"I’ve worked in hospitality for years (as a chef, not front of house)

These kinds of problems are commonplace in the restaurant industry, not that I’m trying to make excuses ! It’s got to the point where there is a serious skilled staff crisis, what kind of person would want to train as a chef for £19,000 a year and be expected to turn out 70 hour weeks, every week, without complaining, when you could easily earn better money in most other careers and receive regular evenings and weekends off. 

Until recently, I have worked 16 hour days, 6 days a week, 50-51 weeks a year for probably the last 15 years. Because I told myself i loved the job, and it was worth sacrificing a personal life for career advancement. I had a complete breakdown a year ago, ended up not working for 6 months whilst I got my life back on track.  I wouldn’t change any of it, but I’m also not willing to put myself through that again just to help line an owners pockets. 

I’m lucky enough to have found a job as a chef for a living-wage certified employer who actually complains if I work more than my contracted 42 hours, as they know they’ll have to pay me for it.  It’s as good as it gets for a chef these days. 

The industry as a whole needs to change, from the top down. and until enough staff make a stand and refuse to work without fair pay, things will only get worse."
"Well the UK seems sensible there. It has a proportional number of cones and they're in the right sort of place. 

Now if you told me these cones were attending football matches, commuting by train or committing armed robberies, I'd be more concerned."
"Good point. If you are not under arrest you must be specifically told that that is the case. You should be told clearly that you are not under arrest and are free to leave. You should be provided with a copy of the Law Society Notice (called I think)""Guidance to people attending voluntarily at a Police Station"". You cannot be arrested simply to stop you leaving. You can be arrested if subsequently the Police have evidence that was not available when they were treating you as a 'Voluntary Attender'."

"You should read up on British harassment laws. Being a creepy weirdo staring at people all the time can qualify. Usual advice is to take a diary of all incidents, and take it to your local police station to make a complaint."
"&gt; Nobody has time for anyone anymore. 

This hits close to home. It's quite sad seeing all my friend group move to different cities and the workaholics get swamped by their jobs. I'd love for companies to start doing 7-hour work days and 4-day weeks. Some case studies have shown that productivity can actually go up and staff morale increases, while having more time to actually *live life* outside of work.

&amp;#x200B;

For the being bored of life aspect, find the things that make you happy and do more of that. A steady schedule of live music, festivals, gaming and jam days with friends keep me afloat most of the time. Can be tricky getting yourself motivated when you're in a funk but it's worth it in the long run."
