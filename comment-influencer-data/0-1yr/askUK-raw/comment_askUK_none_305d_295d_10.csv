"American politics is a soap opera. It's not about the dull business of politics, it's personalities and intrigue and drama. A lot of people think it's gearing up to be the new Watergate. 

So, that's why it's interesting to a lot of people who have little or no interest in politics, they aren't interested in the politics in America, they're interested in the scandal."

"Unless there is a walk-in centre nearby, I would call 111. 

In most cases where they have advised me to go to a GP, quoting the line ""I spoke to 111 and they advised me to see a GP as a matter of urgency"" has usually made an appointment magically appear. "
"Just FYI, there was a post from someone in a similar situation, and op called the police specifically asking that they would prefer to remain anonymous. After that, police turned up knocking loudly on their door and shouting something along the lines 'you've made a report so we are here to follow on it' etc., making it very obvious to the drug dealing neighbour. If this is a concern, please be aware of this possibility before contacting the police."
"The question that we would ask in response is why are your officers so quick to use violence?

I'm sure there are examples of us having trigger-happy cops and you having peaceful ones. Also, do you not have many female officers?"
"When I used to commute by train I kept a log of all the times my trains were fucked. I got some bullshit back about how some of my complaints were trains that were technically on time. Some of them were only 10 minutes late granted, but I wanted to highlight exactly how much we weren't getting the advertised service. I think out of a month of commuting, three services were on time. 

Anyway I got given rail vouchers. That I couldn't use at peak times. "
"Ex-police here.  In 13 years i managed to arrest/detain God knows how many people by being polite and professional and by verbally asking them to comply.

By keeping things chill, you have room to manouvere.  If the person you're with gets irate but you don't, you are still in control.  You also have all of your tactical options.  If they go from being irate to threatening, you can remain calm or you can escalate.

However if you go straight in with aggression and anger, there is no option to deescalate.  The person you're interacting with has no incentive to be compliant, because however they react they know they'll probably get a beating anyway, so they may as well go down fighting.

That's not to say I didn't fight, I had some proper messy scraps in my time, but they were always after all other options had been exhausted, rather than straight to the fighting.

So I think there are two key differences.  Firstly, militarization.  American police are not police officers, they are Gendarmes/para-militaries in everything but name.  You cannot walk into a situation pointing a rifle at people and expect a calm response.  

This leads onto the second key difference.  Communication.  Being alone, on foot patrol 20 minutes from backup with nothing but a metal pole for protection teaches you how to communicate.  It teaches you how to calm people down and get the best possible response from them.  For the main reason that if you escalate and lose, you will suffer for it.

I know our police are seen as a soft touch, but our biggest problems are from the lack of government and judicial support.  I genuinely think our police (and also those in other Commonwealth nations like Oz/NZ/Canada) are the best in the world."
"In principle, I am fine with it. 

But the reaction, the glorification of corporal punishment, violence and the dehumanisation of the criminals is disgusting.

"Basically: because the surgeon &amp; medical staff's time is worth more than your time - in terms of your health as well as sheer cash value.

Surgery is not predictable: sometimes even routine surgeries take longer than expected; conversely sometimes surgeries have to be cancelled at the last minute, freeing up space and time for someone else (perhaps someone in in-patients or on a wait list somewhere; and so on. It's therefore more cost-effective to make sure you are ready to go when the surgical team are ready and the surgery is prepped, than have the surgical team and the room waiting for your convenience.  

If you want a system where you get given a specific half hour 'starting' slot, then you are going to end up paying much more for that than for one where the patients move around the scarcer resource, e.g. surgical time and OR availability."
"Sorry to be the one to tell you this, but I don't think you got the job. You could call them, but be prepared for disappointment."
"I imagine the person on the moped would have to be making a conscious effort to try and evade the police before they employed this tactic, so I don't see where there could be any comebacks onto the Police. 

If the person they hit has been evading them and isn't who they believed they were initially after, why else were they trying their best not to be caught?"

"Put in an official complaint to the Practice Manager, today.  Don't wait, don't call 111 first, email a complaint through to them with ""FORMAL COMPLAINT:  Unable to Access GP Appointment for 4+ Weeks"" in the subject line right now.

Try to keep the email calm, unemotional and stick to the facts but do not downplay your issues.  In the last paragraph, outline exactly what you would like to happen next (I presume that in your case, this will be a phone call offering you the next available appointment).  

By all means call 111 or whatever other advice you've been given in conjunction with the email, but do not wait to be fobbed off again.  That email needs to go off today. "
"I love the idea that our police are more tame, like domesticated cats.

Unlike in the USA our police evolved alongside humans over 1000s of years. Eventually reaching a finely balanced equilibrium, where they provide us protection and we reward them with praise and treats."

"I live in south east London and have breakfast delivery in my area. I’ve ordered a couple of times and it’s been great up until the inevitable self loathing, which ime lasts the rest of the day."
Exactly. In simple terms I’d say American police view their number one priority is to catch criminals and British police view their number one priority is to help the public 
"Quality advice; legal, profitable and delicous. "
"I once volunteered to be the 'bad guy' at some police training scenarios for new officers. In one scenario I got to play the belligerent drunk (it was good fun) swinging a pint around and shouting at people. Most of the trainee police officers would be polite but firm and I'd probably end up in handcuffs without too much fuss. A couple came in angry and way too authoritative. So I usually chucked my (plastic) pint at them and would be a pain to handcuff (to a certain extent as it was a training exercise so they couldn't use too much force). Even as a actor only pretending to be a drunk the ones that came in irate really pissed me off and I'd *want* to make their life miserable. But I always remember one woman police trainee who demonstrated deescalation perfectly. She was one of those people that could get along with anyone. Before I knew it she'd convinced me to put my 'pint' down (i.e. got the weapon out of my reach) and had me chatting away like nothing had happened. Didn't even need to use the handcuffs like the rest. And I was fully intending to be a horrible drunk since it was my role!

&amp;#x200B;

I think what some Americans might have forgotten is that most people don't want to be in trouble with the police. They've just had a moment of anger or irrationality and gotten themselves in a real stupid situation. They are still people and usually decent people at that. Often once they've calmed down they'll go 'ah shit, I've just done something really fucking stupid. Best not do anything worse and cooperate so hopefully I can go home tonight'.

"I wouldn’t conflate interest/disgust/agreement in Donald Trump to caring about American politics. I think they’re very different and I think many children are only interested in one.

I think teenagers on average struggle to understand politics or be interested by its inner-workings. British Parliamentary politics is often complicated and not interesting to many young people. Whilst Donald Trump is loud and obnoxious. It’s easy to comment and have an opinion on the US President, as opposed to Parliamentary debates and discussions. Although, I’ve noticed many teenagers sharing their opinions on Brexit. But again, it’s not as flashy at Trumps tweets."

"&gt;really only for urgent issues

So I am not a doctor or any kind of medical expert, nor do I intend to alarm you, but your symptoms absolutely *could* be urgent, particularly since they seem to be getting progressively worse. It could be anything from a blood flow issue to something pressing on your spine. Just because you're not rolling around in agony or coughing up blood *doesn't* mean your issue is not urgent.

If this is happening every day and it's painful, I'd consider that to be interfering with your quality of life. Go to your nearest walk-in centre, tell your GP you need an urgent appointment, or call 111 and tell them you're really worried. I'm loathe to suggest going to A+E, but if nothing else is working, you absolutely should."

"&gt;  I know that we're from different countries, but if cops approached me the way they did, I don't even think I'd be afraid of breaking the law.

We have a model known as 'policing by consent'. The idea is that police aren't soldiers who keep order with fear, but civilians in a position of responsibility who treat the public with respect and are respected by the public in turn.

"&gt;in Ontario where the healthcare is free for those whole live in the province, it’s not as chaotic. 

It still costs more, in terms of tax payer subsidy though (the NHS is one of the cheapest healthcare systems in the developed world).

&gt;Do you know why patients are charged for missed appointments (when they don’t call in advance?). The text message I receive saying a missed appointment costs the NHS £150 is great, but why not fine people who abuse the system? 

Is there a typo in the first sentence?  Do you mean ""Do you know why patients *aren't* charged for missed appointments?""

The answer is: because it would be against the ethos of the NHS.  Because people miss appointments for good reasons.  Because a fine would hit hardest the most vulnerable patients. Because we don't want to make people afraid of accepting medical appointments just incase they miss them and are fined.  Because we don't think you should get into debt because you got sick (or because you got well or because you got scared of going to the appointment or because your childcare fell through).  Because the cost of getting the money back is very likely to be far more than £150 given the administration costs, staff effort, financial processing, etc.  No reasonable fine (reasonable being: something most people could pay, not so much that it cripples people) is likely to be cost-effectively reclaimed."

"If they've blocked you, even on Twitter, just do a chargeback and print out the blocked page to show your bank.

I have no idea why companies are so stupid to do this, I guess it's because social media teams aren't well versed in the law, but it's becoming increasingly common. I had a client who had been blocked for complaining on his bank's Twitter and Facebook after they ignored his emails and written letters, all perfectly polite by the way.

"It depends on the risk involved. They've presumably done a risk assessment to determine what injury and death rate they expect from this policy. I haven't, so I don't know how risky it is, but instinctively it feels like it's a relatively dangerous thing to be doing.

If the risk is comparable to things they already do when someone's resisting arrest then fine. If it's significantly riskier then I think we should be careful, we don't want a police force where dangerous techniques are normalised."

"American cops are an utter fucking joke. Barely any training compared to ours, no training in deescalation, quick to violence, massively corrupt, far too aggressive. Also they're usually held to account whenever they fuck up.

Our police 'police by consent'. [Some reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles) for you.

&gt;""Policing by consent"" indicates that the legitimacy of policing in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so.

"
"&gt;except that I'm a cunt for asking this question

I know Americans seem to have got the idea that in the UK  'cunt' is a multi-purpose word you can drop into any conversation, but it really isn't. So my tip is - don't say it in front of people you don't know."
"&gt;Any concern that you are sliding into a police state

Assuming you're American, you're being a bit cheeky asking that, considering the majority of our police aren't even armed, and that the government keep cutting police funding. Can't have a police state if you're not funding them.

US style policing is far more reminiscent of a police state than the UK. 

Also, we don't have freedom of speech, we have freedom of expression. We don't fetishise a centuries old document that protects hate speech, whilst still claiming to have freedom of speech despite the existence of laws like the Communist Control Act which criminalises membership of political parties.

Not a single country on the planet has freedom of speech, just varying levels of rectrictions."

"&gt; they don't draw weapons, taze

In general British officers don't have weapons to draw, not all would even carry tasers on a regular basis.

And drawing a weapon or taser, let alone discharging it, results in a shitload of additional paperwork, so our police in general are trained to use many other methods to de-escalate a situation.

TLDR British officers use violence (or the threat of it) as a last resort, not first. "
