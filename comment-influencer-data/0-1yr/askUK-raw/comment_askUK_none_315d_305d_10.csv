TBF I rarely see my friend now. She lives on the other side of the country. We mainly stay in touch through text. She never rings me so to ring me with this was a bit weird. If the friendship ended I wouldn’t be heartbroken. I’ve felt it’s been pretty one sided for a while. 
"A gossip like this doesn't do it only once. She clearly has no regard for patient confidentiality, GDPR or DPA. If she broke the rules for you then she probably does it does if for others.
Also she had no way of knowing if it was or wasn't for you nor the results of the test. It is completely inappropriate for her to contact someone else and talk about what you were buying. 

If it was a drunken slip of the tongue then maybe excusable but this was pure and intentional gossip.

I would go in to the shop and complain - it would be unlikely that they'd sack her for a first offense. Of course it might not be a first offense but that's not your problem.
"
Go ahead and complain
"Used to work in a pharmacy for nearly 10 years. This is a significant breach of patient confidentiality, also breach of the new GDPR. 

How much trouble she will get in depends on the company and who you complain to.

If you want to cause the least trouble then contact the actual pharmacy and discuss with the pharmacist, like pub licensing they're ultimately responsible, manager of a store is also a good shout but they don't have the same legal standards to uphold as a pharmacist."
Cottage pie and an apple crumble with ambrosia custard for dessert
"Nice try, Daily Mail employee"
That’s what’s bothering me. She’s quite gossipy anyways but she’s always seemed to take her job seriously. She and her sister are super close and share everything. I just assumed she drew a line with her job. Obviously not. She must tell her sister everything. It makes me wonder about things my friend has told me in the past abt people and where she could have gotten that information. 
"Say this to the manager “I can’t come back here and buy things if my shopping list is going to be broadcast, I’m sure others would feel the same way”"
"Have you thought about volunteering somewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

I did it a couple of times when I was abroad on my own, at a place that served Christmas Dinners for those who couldn't afford it. It was amazing the amount of families who came down, and how grateful they were.

&amp;#x200B;

All the volunteers then went out after we were finished, and had some drinks. Met some amazing people who I'm still in contact with, 15 years later.

&amp;#x200B;

If not that, my boss said the best Christmas he ever had was the year after his divorce came through. His wife had the kids, so he just sat around in his pants, ate a massive steak and a whole bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape to himself, then gorged on Quality Street in front of the TV until he fell asleep. That sounds good, too."
Damnit I already texted her and asked if she knew there were pineapples here. You guys are assholes  haha
"I found most people didn't give a shit. But there was a noticeable positive reaction sometimes, especially when I was in places that didn't have many non-Americans around.

Some girls clearly had a bit a thing for my accent. Which was weird for me because I'm not particularly good looking (so I don't get any attention elsewhere), and no matter how much some of them insisted, I really don't look or sound like Harry Potter (I'm from Lancaster). 

There were some negative reactions though. Some young guys in particular would get a bit standoffish because it made them feel insecure. Others assumed I was snooty or pretentious. And in more rural parts, people struggled to understand me and couldn't really be arsed figuring it out.  "
"She deserves to be sacked. It's pretty much one of the most important rules of modern medicine, and what she did is morally and legally wrong. "
I know it to some people it doesn’t seem like a big deal but it kinda is. She probably has done it to other people. Seeing them get something private and telling her sister or friend and it’s beyond unprofessional
"I wouldn't mind if it was legal.

I don't use it but as long as it makes other people happy and doesn't harm anyone, I'm not against it."
"""when I see a taxi driver with his family in the cab""

What? How many times do you see taxi drivers with their family in the cab? How do you even know it's their family? That's a really weird thing to say."
"Finally, a question I am qualified to answer. I was a Revenue Protection Officer (Ticket inspector) a number of years ago (check out my r/talesfromsecurity posts from years ago).

In short, you just remember faces, ethnicities, certain clothing, groups of people travelling together, passengers with children or animals, the colour of their luggage etc. Practically anything that sets them apart from everyone else in that carriage.

When the train stops at a station and some passengers get off, others get on and I’d walk back down the train again. You then ‘recall’ rather than remember who’s ticket you’ve already checked.

Think of it like this. If somebody asked you to list every film you’ve ever watched, you couldn’t do it. But if they said they would read out a list of film titles and you have to tell them if you’ve seen them or not, you could probably do it with a high degree of accuracy.

This is a skill that you simply pick up over time."
"How old is she? If she's over 30 then she'd probably love Pineapples, we haven't had them since the ban.

Gammon, Egg and Chips with a Pineapple ring I reckon"
"And if she does get sacked, its no less than she deserves for being a twat.

Fuck her, and fuck the ""friend"""
"95p (+£2.95 shipping) over budget which is fairly considerably on a tenner but for the beauty of this you can't help justify it.

"""What's a pineapple"" IM DONE"
"You can get an absolute legend of the watch world - a design classic, a modern masterpiece and a little bit of 90s nostalgia thrown into one - the [Casio F-91W](http://amzn.eu/d/3v4F8eb) is only £7.97.

(Note - [according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W#Usage_in_terrorism) it's also a favourite of Al-Qaeda and ""possession of the F-91W suggests the wearer has been trained in bomb making by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan"". A ringing endorsement for certain.)"
"I must say it certainly draws the females in,  they love it hearing it. From my experience of working back on forth in New York I only get positive and interested attention. A couple of times I’ve had Americans try take the piss but obviously Americans are the easiest people to rinse on earth so didn’t go down too well on their behalf. "
"I'm just talking about being in America as a visitor here, but when I was in Atlanta this guy said hello to me and I said hello back and we exchanged a few words and he said something like ""woah that's a crazy accent you've got there, I'm guessing English isn't your first language""  I was like ""dude, I am English""  Once he found out I was English he didn't want the conversation to end.  I'd assume English people in Atlanta are rarer than English people in say New York or Orlando!"
"My husband and I admitted to each other after a year that, roughly 40% of the time, we had no clue what the other was saying.  "
"Volunteer. Human interaction, you learn useful skills and it counts as work experience on your CV. "
"A film director I know used to work for the BBC but is now freelance. He told me a story once of a black crewmember of his who left her hotel in Louisiana to travel to a filming location, it was a trip of about 40 miles or so and for most of the way there was a police car following her.

She finally gets sick of being followed and pulls over. As the policeman gets to her window, she yells pretty much at the top of her lungs in a broad cockney accent.

""Why have you been following me for so long, i've done nothing wrong!"". The officer is taken aback for a moment and stammers ""Sorry ma'am, i thought you were black"" and lets her go on her way."
"No, sorry I've never been to your house."
"Check with restaurants, usually after 9pm some pubs wont allow children. You'll most likely all have to stand up on the tube, considering you'll probably be using the main lines and they'll be busy at most hours of the day. Colouring books and other things are encouraged to keep kids entertained at restaurants and pubs and there is zero issue with you drinking while you and your children have a meal. We're pretty relaxed on booze here.

Just, enjoy yourselves. Don't focus so much on not being one thing or another or the whole trip will be tense and not enjoyable."
"I’m a yank living in the UK with my Brit husband. All of my family are in rural parts of Georgia, and they always seem to struggle to understand my husband when he speaks. I act as the translator. "
It perhaps is shocking but so is making kids in school pledge allegiance to a flag on a regular basis.
"It's the same reason food at motorway services is more expensive than the same food at the same chain would be on a highstreet - you're a captive audience, and they know you haven't got any choice, so they can charge anything that they want.

On a high street, you wouldn't go into the overpriced cafe if you could go to another cafe next door.

When you've got ten minutes till your next train, and you desperately need to eat something, and your only option is that limp looking overpriced sandwich in Upper Crust, your choices are to just accept that, and buy it,  leave the station and risk missing your train / not being able to get back onto the platform / etc, or not eating at all.

tl;dr; because capitalism."
"I just finished up a 2 year stint living in the DMV area for work.  For reference, I'm brown.  Folks absolutely treated me differently once they found out I was British or heard my accent. Before this revelation, most interactions I had were fairly neutral but there were some notably negative ones.  One piece of advice I received was if I had any official type of business (e.g. going to the MVA or post office) wear work uniform - and it made a difference."
It would also make the police very happy. It's a waste of time enforcing it and most coppers don't care about it. Not many stoners scrap in town on a Saturday night either.
"Haven't touched it in years. Got bored with it after smoking way too much for way too long. Don't miss it. Still hope it gets legalised, both medicinally and recreationally.

But, as you say, with Theresa May's husband being the largest investor in a cannabis exporting company, I won't hold my breath"
"How about Toad in the Hole? Loads of Lincolnshire sausages baked inside a big Yorkshire Pudding.  It would totally be my comfort food away from home. 

The Yorkshire Pudding batter is really easy to make and just requires super hot oil, and the sausage are easy to cook to. "
"As someone who works in healthcare I couldn’t disagree with this any more. Discretion and confidentiality are second only to saving lives, especially when it comes to things like pregnancy tests, when there can be a lot more on the line than simply a little embarrassment.

If I broke confidentiality I would fully expect to lose my job, and this person doesn’t deserve hers.

Breaking confidentiality around pregnancies etc is how we end up with people buying abortion pills off the internet and causing themselves serious harm, because they don’t feel safe going to medical professionals in case their family find out. Breaking confidentiality is how an abusive partner or ex finds something to hold over the head of the patient.

Fuck this person, and fuck anyone who thinks that breaching confidentiality is a minor matter that shouldn’t cost you you job. Discretion and confidentiality are literally her job.

I doubt you’d be saying the same thing if it was your doctor telling your friends about your own medical history."
"I don't think I've seen anything Paganesque in rural Britain. We had fetes, maybe a may pole, and a nice church."
"I have no idea what happened to everyone else in the thread. I'm half Chinese and went to high school and university in the States, having an English accent made me a fucking superhero."
"Buy yourself a decent present, loads of food and booze, and do what you like all day, and you’ll probably have a better Christmas than most. 

Christmas is made so magical for us as kids, and it’s sad that, as adults, we put so much expectation on the day that we can never live up to. "

"&gt;and the NHS

Underrated brand, that."
"Do NOT complain to the pharmacy manager. ALWAYS take this to the higher body, eg customer services. It is manager discretion to follow up on complaints. Complaints took to the head office or customer service line CANNOT be avoided and is taken very seriously. This is from my experience within the industry, and might not apply to small I dependent pharmacies. "
Nothing nicer than a roast dinner. 
"Paid for fuel at a gas station on a road trip holiday around the South. As I was leaving, I said ""cheers"" to the cashier, without really thinking about it.

Walking out, I heard him ask the next customer ""*did that guy just say CHEESE?*"" and it secretly delighted me."

"Even though not all DSS recipients are problem tenants, nor are all problem tenants are in receipt of DSS, tenants that receive DSS are more likely to be a problem tenant.

If you've been stung once or twice, and it's cost you months or years of stress and thousands of pounds in the process, you can hardly blame someone for not wanting to take the risk again."
"What about complaining to the pharmacy, but saying that you don't want to name exactly who did it because you don't want to get them in trouble? The pharmacy manager will then hopefully talk to all of their staff and remind them of their responsibilities."
"My friend who is black lives in New York (I don’t think he uses reddit or I’d poke him to chime in). He says that people are sometimes quite confused when they hear his accent, and often their only reference point for a black British person is Jeffrey from Fresh Prince!"

"&gt; What would happen to the Church of England if the UK became a republic?

Possibly nothing; it's not like there aren't plenty of republics with state religions.

&gt; Would the Windsors remain the church leaders?

It's always been the monarch that's been supreme governor of the church, rather than members of any particular house, so I'd be surprised if it became attached to the Windsors. I'd guess either the new head of state would be the head of the church or else the church would find a new way of choosing its head."
"The only thing you need to know is that nobody in London gives the tiniest shit what you and your kids do as long as it doesn't bother them.

"Honestly, expect it to be very similar to what you're used to in the US.

&gt; Are there restaurants or times we should avoid?

Some restaurants in London are pretty small, so I'd avoid tiny ones like that in rush hour with there being six of you (not because the restaurant will have a problem with it, but because you'll probably be squished into a corner, and I personally find that a bit too claustrophobia-inducing)

I can't really remember many restaurants in London, so I can't really give any specific suggestions.

&gt;  Should they sit or stand while riding the underground?

If you can get seats, take them, but if an elderly person or someone with loads of shopping comes in you should probably insist they take your/your wife's seats, or your older children's seats.

&gt; If we're eating with them at a restaurant, would it be inappropriate for both of us to have a beer?

In the UK I reckon people would find it more strange to *not* have a beer than to have one. Obviously getting shit-faced in front of your kids is another matter entirely, of course!

A lot of pubs won't allow children to be there past 21:00, so make sure they're not in the pub at that time.

&gt;  Is it allowed to bring coloringcolouring books and crayons to places?

Yeah. I've seen a few places with colouring books and crayons at the door

&gt;What are the faux pas we should avoid? What are the things we can do that will leave the British people with a better impression of Americans than usual?

Other than making sure you stay to the right on escalators, not being very, very loud, and not irritating the Queen's Guard, I can't think of anything.

You'll be fine, no need to worry. Enjoy your visit!
"
"In this situation I would talk to her. IE the sister working at the pharmacy. 

Make it very clear to her that by sharing your personnel information she has broken the law. 

And if you complained the only option the pharmacy would have is to immediately fire her. 

Make it clear the only reason she still has a job. Is that you do not want her to loose it. 

But if you hear of anything like this again. Your own moral compass will force you to come forward. 

At least assuming you are not angry enouth to want her fired and loose any relationship. 

"
"For many years I worked 2 jobs. 37.5hrs/week in an office. And then four pub shifts. Two on weeknights then on Sat and Sun. So I was essentially working 7 days a week. It made me want to die. I have no idea idea how I did it for so long,

I ended up going back to Uni because slogging at low wage hours for 70+hrs was never going to be a long term option and I was better off aiming for a better paid main job."
"&gt;Sorry ma'am, i thought you were black

This is one of those things you hear and then think is obviously bullshit, then think about it a bit harder and sadly realise that it could have well happened "
I find people's responses funny when they hear someone's accent that doesn't align remotely with what they expected from their appearance. My college husband was 100% ethnically Chinese but raised in Belfast since he was 2 or 3 and has a strong Northern Irish accent.

"I’d hope that they legalise it similar to Amsterdam, smoke in your own house and designated coffee shops but not outside. I don’t know if you’ve been but you barely smell it on the streets at all over there in my experience! "
"Seriously this is so true. Under GDPR law the pharmacy could be fined for breach of confidentiality . you could threaten to report to the ICO and take a ""settlement"" you could be quids in for this.

I would totally advise you to dob her in and demand compensation."

It's the size inconsistencies that really bug the crap outta me. Iggle Piggle will half hide behind a tree, so he is clearly wider than the tree.

Then the Ninky-nonk will drive up the side of the tree, so it must be smaller than the tree, then how did Iggle Piggle fit into it?

"I think you should certainly make a complaint. A pharmacy needs to be a place where your privacy is maintained, no matter what. If it were me I would never go to that pharmacy again for anything private as long as they work there.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are going to complain though I would give your friend a message about it so that she has time to prepare for any blow back she might get from it. Don't let it seem like you are asking for permission, just tell her that you have made a complaint about the invasion of privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, on a more snarky note; If she really thinks its not a big deal then she should not be concerned about the complaint."
"tbh I'd reckon you'd be safest with a decent curry. 

(seriously my ex was from the US and the family tried a few things when we were over there...), there's nothing worse than something that's not quite right, especially when they've tried really hard and there's nothing you can say other than to pretend it's amazing - then you get the same thing again next time.

  Plus, the best bit of being somewhere other than the UK is the food normally ;)

If she's been there a while maybe get her some proper teabags and a can of Heinz baked beans, that's about as far as my food nostalgia went while I was there.  And if you can find some back bacon rather than streaky that'll probably go down well. "
