"Famously the Queen doesn't ever carry cash with her, so they can get away with changing the faces on the coins without her being any the wiser. Stamps on the other hand are a different story; Liz goes through a couple of books of stamps a month when she's sending out all those birthday cards to 100-yeat-olds, so Royal Mail have got to be a bit more careful to keep her sweet or she'll end up sending them out through FedEx instead."
"&gt;Spain as ""Castile"" or Germany as ""Prussia""

It is quite annoying, and as /u/Dogilo pointed out I'd probably be more annoyed if I wasn't English. I don't find it outright offensive though, or the worst thing ever."

It will definately get chipped or scratched within 2 days. Prepare mentally for it and accept it as an inevitable part of life.
"Not the largest or worst, but my town built a shopping centre and put the rates so high no one can afford to rent a unit there."
"My Dad had dementia and I got his licence revoked after a couple of terrifying incidents. Not on a motorway but he was driving on the wrong side of the road totally oblivious to the car coming straight at him, that had to get in the other lane to avoid a crash. 

He also pulled out without looking at a give way sign and a car had to mount the pavement to avoid crashing into him.

I can only speak for his situation, but if he'd got on a motorway, he either wouldn't have noticed he was going the wrong way or notice but he wouldn't have the mental capacity to work out what to do about it.

Dementia must be reported to the DVLA but Drs leave patients to do it. A lot of patients don't want to stop driving so don't tell the DVLA or simply forget. They have dementia after all! It means not only are they driving with limited capacity, but they're not insured. 

I think we need a system where Drs are required to report reportable medical conditions for starters. I also think people should have to have driving checks as they get older.

Where I live, older people cause serious crashes nearly every day. (It's a retirement area). Normally they just seriously injure themselves but not always. 

If anyone sees anyone scary, get the number plate and report to the DVLA.

"Darien scheme

"This is hilariously enough the closest to the correct answer, from what I found. 

The Stamp designs with the Queen's head on are called Machin's (after the person who designed them) and from the [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machin_series) 

&gt;Arnold Machin's 1964 effigy of the Queen was replaced on British coins in 1984 by an older-looking effigy by Raphael Maklouf. However, the effigy on British Machin stamps has never been updated, and the last proposals to these ends were rejected by the Queen herself."

"Agreed. I seem to recall the BOE saying that he wasn't eligible to be on the £10 note despite the campaign for it due to having a (ahem) ""criminal record"".

I am sure this entire episode was conceived and produced around the idea that [Lord Alan Sugar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxi6QDwQyLU) would call one of the contestants a doughnut in the board room at the end. 
"Its important that you break it in by doing some burnouts and doughnuts in the local parking lot, as well as revving it up to the red line for a few minutes.

"Before I went self-employed I always changed when I got home. Can't stand shirts, can't stand posh trousers. Sooner I was into a t-shirt and jeans/combats the better. It was a form of decompressing; if I kept my work stuff on I'd feel like I was still at work, and work me is nothing like casual me. 

A thought occurs... maybe it boiled down to the fact that my parents always made me change out of my school uniform. Must find a shrink."

Loads of small cable tv companies took the government money to do these and most ended up going bust and getting bought up by others which eventually lead to NTL:Telewest. They decided the name was pretty naff and then leased the name Virgin Media from Branson for 30 years. They were then bought by Liberty Global a few years ago. So basically VM is the outcome of all of that and all the lovely profits from it get pumped into an American company but at least there's a second major ISP provider other than OpenReach
"&gt; Been applying to just about every place imaginable since March 2018. Tesco, Asda, Argos, Currys, McDonalds, KFC, PizzaHut, Thorpe Park, you name it. Most end in no response, and about 10 have called back. Only 1 interview.

Thinking your exam results are in any way relevant for your part time customer service job could be part of it.

"Turing received a royal pardon, yes, but even without it the Police and Crime Act 2017 retroactively pardoned all men cautioned or convicted of sexual offences that would be considered legal today that were outlawed by the Sexual Offences Act 1967.

It’s informally known as the Alan Turing Law.

As far as I’m concerned, Bank of England policy is changeable. His ‘criminal’ record, having received this pardon, doesn’t do anything to take away from the estimated fourteen million lives he and the team at Bletchley saved by shortening the war.

I’m more concerned about how many people I’ve seen suggest Emmeline Pankhurst. Her support of the [white feather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_feather) movement makes her unacceptable.

"There’s been a thread about it yesterday over on r/casualuk that was quite well responded to.

Retired ex met Police here . Is this a regular occurrence ? Ring your local council and ask to speak to the on call environmental health officer. Local councils have a team that attend noise complaints and can issue an enforceable noise order to the occupier of the flat. Hope that helps
It's shit but it made half the F1 grid british.
"Haha It seems so strange to me that anyone would come home and stay in their ""street clothes"". I've always changed into pyjamas or ""house clothes"" which would usually be old tshirts, shorts or sweatpants, even after school and still do the same now after work. I usually come home from work in my uniform but even if not I would still change because its just way more comfortable, and I guess ""spares"" your ""proper"" clothes more. "

"Being Oxford educated, whether in maths or otherwise, has nothing to do with mental arithmetic ability. 

There is a famous story about the greatest mathematician of the 21st (edit: 20th) century, Alexandre Grothendieck illustrating this. He was giving a lecture and was working over a field of (arbitrary) prime characteristic and at some point, someone asked him to give a concrete example and he said ""You mean an actual prime number? ...ok, take 57""

As every darts player will know 57 is 3 x 19 and is therefore not prime.

But in any case, many professional mathematicians will have considerably less experience with mental arithmetic compared to, say, a newsagent."
"I'm not saying I agree necessarily, but the basic idea is supposedly that it's not about distance or speed, but capacity. At peak times, the existing network is at capacity (or expected to reach/exceed capacity based on current trends) between major cities, and it's more effective, straightforward and cheaper to build a new line than to try to improve the existing network. E.g. we can't use double-decker trains used in other countries to increase capacity because so many tunnels, bridges, stations etc can't cope with them. Too many stations can't be enlarged to take longer trains. Etc."
"There will be people at the party, possibly some of your friends, who will have been sexually abused as children.

Why would you want to upset people who've had a shit start in life?

Think of it this way, if your little brother or sister had been raped when they were 5, and made to do sexual stuff to an adult, and it had overshadowed their entire adult life, would you think a fancy dress costume of the country's most famous and evil paedophile was amusing?"

"Yes it does annoy me a bit. I'll let it slide if they're using their own language, but in English they are distinct and English speakers should know the difference.

I can appreciate it's not always obvious when you should be referring to England or the UK though. It happens the other way sometimes too, when someone says the UK, but really what they're talking about it specific to England."
"Doctor here...

"I wish someone could put a stop to this. It’s so annoying travelling across the country to find that another city is just like the one you left.

"Of course you're being underpaid, and in my opinion you must have MUG tattooed on your forehead.

You are being ripped off and exploited, you know you are and you carry on anyway?

"Being able to travel to EU countries with just a passport no questions asked. No travel visas to buy or long queues at the airport. My family being able to live and work abroad in an EU country, again, no questions asked. No work permit needed or work visa. No risk of being deported for whatever reason. Being able to get free health care abroad with an ehic, no medical bills to worry about since the NHS works it all out for you if you are within in EU. The cost of European sourced food stuffs is another thing, and now that's been on the rise (I guess this isn't a direct result but it still impacts my wallet daily).

I'm trying to think of downsides that have directly affected me, but honestly I can't think of any. Before Brexit I hadn't even thought about the pros and cons of the EU. I suppose you aren't really thankful for something until you lose it.

"As a Scotsman, I can honestly say that MOST of the time it doesn't bother me...and it really depends on what context its being said. 

What does drive me mental, and is by far the worst example is when its in reference to the war. It wasn't England that fought the nazis, it was all of us.  There were many, many casualties from the other home nations (my grandfather included) and I feel its an insult for them to be forgot about. "

* [Doughnut Time](https://doughnuttime.co.uk/megas/) will sell you a 'Mega Doughnut' for £15-£22 - *though describing it as a doughnut is a bit of a misnomer*"
No one would actually care. Some may make mild jokes.

"Difficult one for me with it being the weekend. Don't get me wrong, you have every right to be annoyed by it happening, but if the neighbours aren't ones to do it day in day out every night of the week all month then I'd just get over this one.

I know this was 5 hours ago from when I'm commenting so it's already happened, just wanted to add my thoughts. Be interested to see if my opinion is the unpopular one though."
Unless YouGov has changed it will take substantially longer than 3-4 months to make £50. I used to do literally every survey available and it took me well over a year. Possibly different demographics are given more surveys though I suppose.
I definitely thought this thread was going to be about trying to get facial hair implants on the NHS
