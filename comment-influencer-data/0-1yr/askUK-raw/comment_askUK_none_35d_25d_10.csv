"Overtaking.

And the middle lane is for overtaking slow-moving traffic in the left-hand lane.

The middle lane is definitively not the ""normal"" lane, you should move in to the left when you're not overtaking."
There’s nothing worse than a middle lane hogger
/r/Liverpoolfc
"Normalised but not normal. It's a scumbag move.

I had something similar at a kids soft play. On entering and paying the dick behind the counter said ""remind me I've a balloon here for when you leave"" of course the kid heard it. 

On exit ""would you like that balloon?"" Kids like ""yes please"" ""That'll be £2"".

 I imagine it works due to peoples politeness but unfortunately for her I'm a cunt,  so had no problem asking the missus to take the kid out whilst we discussed the practice. It was bad for her and bad for the company as I make sure to tell everyone I speak to not to go to Hickory Dickorys playground near Markeaton park in Derby.

Cheeky fucks."
"There is no specific ""purpose"" for any given lane. The only rule is that, as you say, you should stay in the leftmost lane possible at all times, going into a lane further right only when you need to overtake.

Of course, as you say, in practice, on motorways it seems to be the case that the left lane is primarily used by HGVs and other vehicles travelling at 56mph, the middle lane is used by people who travel at or around the NSL, and the right lane is used by people who want to lose their licence ;)

That can then cause more than a little ""trouble"" when there's only two lanes..."
Fucking hell. I hope you don't drive.
"The middle lane is not ‘normal.’ There is nothing worse than someone who hogs the middle lane. 

Keep left unless you are over taking."
Everyone on Reddit: “I’m .... years old and still don’t know”
"Had a similar thing happen to me in Lisbon, except I wasn’t asked. The waitress just brought some bread, oil and balsamic vinegar to the table and I presumed it was free of charge, only to see it on the bill later. Went to another restaurant where the same thing happened - I asked if it was complimentary, they said no and I told them I didn’t want it. 

I think it’s very cheeky too but not uncommon!"
"Yes, it's a common upselling tactic, and much more common in London or in tourist places.

Where it is free, you will specifically be told e.g. Gino's My Ego places offer (high quality) free snacks between 4.30 and 6.30 (or so) if you order a glass of prosecco.

It's actually far LESS likely to happen in a no-name back street place!"
"Middle lane hogging is now an offence and the police will ticket you.  Thank God.

I've had arseholes right-lane hogging on dual carriageways before, no junction or roundabout for miles.  Most of the time I just undertake and press the horn."
"That's a fucking massive amount of money, and I have actually no idea what you're spending it on."
"Firstly go to the house, explain why you are leaving to both of them, show the messages, then LEAVE.
Then post screenshots on a review/facebook page/google review. This needs calling out and isn't something to be brushed under the carpet.

All he gives is a 'sorry'? That doesn't sounds like a legit wrong person message, that's a 'oh, shes's not game'. Also he has a wife, not likely there is another willing recipient."
Middle and outside are for overtaking. Nothing else.
"Currently in Lisbon and fortunately our guide book mentioned this because it's *very* common. So we've been refusing the upsell. One Napalese place we ate emphasised the stuff they brought over before our food was free of charge, presumably to clear up any confusion.

In one place we ordered a basket of bread (with oils) and they brought over olives and meats too, which would've upped the €2 for the bread to even more. We refused what we hadn't ordered. Very cheeky as I can imagine some folk getting caught out!"
Your surname means you're Gold and should always believe in your soul.
"And Italy. They often call it a cover charge, a bit like UK with service included."
Middle lane hogs who force you to undertake them.
"Pretty sure you can, you just need to have a permit, and have to release them once you've caught the salmon (if you're fishing prior to April the 1st)

https://www.pkc.gov.uk/perthfishing

&gt; Permits can be purchased from, Perth &amp; Kinross Council, Pullar House, 35 Kinnoull Street, Perth PH1 5GD Tel 01738 475000

&gt; Fishing is authorised for all users on the town banks of the River Tay along the North Inch to the Harbour and at small bays along the Dundee road.  Season permit holders are also authorised to fish from the town side of Moncrieff Island.  Fishing is prohibited from the Harbour edge.  A map can be provided on request and is included in application packs."
Unless they specify it’s complementary I’d assume I’m paying for it. Still if they’re gonna be charging you that should be specified and you were right to question it
Middle and far right for overtaking
"Perfectly normal. If it was free, they would say 'compliments of the house' or similar. Not just London, not just tourists, they are just encouraging you to splash out on an extra."
"Left (nearside) lane: Regular traffic.  
Centre lane: Overtaking  
Right lane: More overtaking - but HGVs can't use it.

This principle continues to apply for roads with more lanes - such as the kind of awful 6-lane bit of M25 near Heathrow."
"Are you buying all your food from Fortnum and Masons?

Or do you have serious FOMO?"
"Not if you don’t have a permit from whoever owns the land/water. You don’t need a license in Scotland (unless you’re on the river esk I think), but you’ve always gotta buy a permit, which sadly always costs loads for trout and salmon"
"The limit is 3500kg not 3750kg.

Regardless, as your car is only 1500kg you'll be under the limit because you aren't realistically going to tow a 2 ton caravan with a 1.5 ton car.

So, the question has changed slightly to *what four berth caravan can I tow with my 1500kg car?*

The recommendation (and it is only that) that you don't tow a caravan that is any more than 85% of the car weight. So, we're looking for a caravan that is around 1275kg.

Caravans have two weights, the first is basically the van with nothing in it, often called MRO (Mass in Running Order). The second weight is MTPLM (Maximum Technically Permissible Laden Mass), this is the most the caravan should ever weight with all your stuff in it. The difference between the weights is the payload.
Payload will typically need to include the awning, gas bottles, spare wheel etc. 

Ok, so you don't mention a budget, but lets see what we can find...

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2004-AVONDALE-RIALTO-550-4-BERTH-CARAVAN-WITH-MOVERS-L-SHAPE-SEATS-NICE-SETUP/174000332349

I can't find specs for a 2004 model, but the 2003 should be close enough: http://www.uktow.com/caravans.asp?lc=0&amp;model=Avondale%20Rialto%20550%20/4&amp;company_name=Avondale

Ok, so MTPLM is over the 85% figure - but will you load up the van that much ? MRO is 1100kg, so you have 175kg payload for your stuff (keep in mind the above notes - must include awning etc). In this case we should add the weight of the mover too, as it is unlikely to have been fitted at factory and thus is not part of the MRO weight.

I'd say, provided you don't load up the van with heavy stuff (cycles, big gas BBQ etc) you'll probably be ok, but you will have to pay attention to how you load up the caravan and car. Be aware you're right on your limits though and you may decide that as a newbie tower you want to go lighter.

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2000-BAILEY-PAGEANT-MOSELLE-4-BERTH-CARAVAN-MOTOR-MOVER-LIGHT-WEIGHT/223630302553 is better still, 1038kg MRO, 1297kg MTPLM. 

When viewing a caravan there is typically a small plate near the door or sometimes on the a-frame that will give you the weights. Check the handbook if available too.

So, now you need to match your weight requirement and budget and start looking at caravans to see what you like and don't like in terms of decor and layout. 

A CRIS document for a caravan is a very worthwhile peice of documentation. Look for evidence of damp - mildew or dirty walls, give them a prod to see if they are soft too. You can buy damp meters to check if you feel so inclined. Its a very common issue on vans of all ages.

If you find one without an awning don't worry - awnings frequently come up secondhand due to people changing their caravan and the awnin g not fitting, check with your local dealers to see if they hold any stock of used awnings.

Tyres must not be cracked or worn - caravans generally do small mileages and sit around a lot so tyres often age and crack. Also you must not run car tyres on a caravan, they must be 6 ply (or above), basically commercial vehicle tyres (like a transit etc).

Car towball - years ago you used to grease the towball, but virtually all caravans now have a stabilising hitch - for this to work properly is it essential that the towball isn't greased, in fact it must be kept completely clean.  So, if there is any sort of lever around the hitch like this: https://www.towbarexpress.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/alko-stabiliser.jpg or https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UqoaMOhqL._SY355_.jpg or https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qf1BkAMEL._SY355_.jpg the towball needs to be clean. If the towball on the car has previously been used and has been greased I would suggest replacement - the towball part is inexpensive and easy to fit.

I would suggest you join the caravan club, who have lots of resources to help you get up to speed as well as a huge book of sites to visit! They also offer training days to help you learn/get used to towing which you might consider worth it. 

If you have more questions, post them."
"34 and still working it out.

I'll let you know."
"It made my blood boil.  We already prop up massive corporations who refuse to pay living wages in the form of 'in work benefits'.  To then ship them unwilling free labour from the Dole queue was just an early sign of things to come.

Every time someone whines about their tax paying for benefit scroungers, I point out that it's not.  It's actually paying for another luxury yacht for some faceless CEO they've probably never thought about."
"Your underwear will be clean when you put in in the dryer, so it doesnt matter."
"There are various guiding/fly fishing companies that you can contact to arrange trips with, and I think they might sort permits out for you as well."
"Overtaking, have you ever been on a duel carriage way with 2 lorry's both going 56 trying to overtake? It takes an infuriating amount of time and causes tailbacks.

Just one situation that 3 lanes circumvents. Also traffic volume increase."
"&gt;This needs calling out and isn't something to be brushed under the carpet.

This. Do it."
"I ordered some toast for breakfast in a small cafe in Portugal and it came dry, I asked for butter and the waitress brought one of those little foil packets of butter. When I got the bill I had been charged 10 cents for the butter!"
"I drove an auto this year for my first long distance drive, 400 miles, borrowed a pool car from work, a Q5, had only ever driven friends autos a short distance before that.

I've resolved to only ever buy autos in the future, so smooth, no fannying around with gears, fuel economy was good.

When you're stuck in stop-start traffic an auto is a boon.

First time I used cruise control as well, that's another must have.

Edit: I do like the odd weekend rag around and I guess that can be 'more fun' in a manual, but if you've got flap and paddle or similar then that 'problem' is solved."
"There are a host of surname origins, from being ""so-and-so's son"", an occupation (Smith), an ancestor having a particular characteristic (Short, Wise) or living near something (Brook). There's also surnames that originate from settlement/place names, such as the usage amongst nobilty (for example, the son of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge could use the name George Cambridge).

In your case, Hadley probably comes from one of a few places called Hadley or Hadleigh in England, or could have originated organically for someone who lived as you describe.

The difficult part is that a lot of this is conjecture. The usage of surnames has varied over time and many have their origins several centuries ago."
"A lot of work for nurses if your qualifications are reciprocal/you might have to be registered (I’m not in the field at all, but you would have your qualifications etc checked, it may be easier if you’re from the EU but don’t quote me)

Living in London is the default people think about when it comes to moving to the UK, but it’s expensive. Maybe think about your interests/desires and tee them up with the cost of living. A smaller city would be cheaper but are you looking for nightlife? If you live somewhere smaller you could afford  to rent your own flat/house, which is harder for London 

Lots of different ways to make friends - you could use Meetup or generally search around for hobbies you may have and continue, or take up something new. 

Think about whether you want to be here throughout the Brexit uncertainty - would you move here before October 31st, would you have to get settled status? I think that people with an EU passport should be fine overall but we truly do not know the outcome for everyone"
200m or 400m sprint.
I think of this as normal practice. Never assume a business is giving anything for free.

I preaume you have a laudromat on campus. Tgere will be one machine to wash and one to dry
He's a 60-70 yo and I'm in my 20s. Why would I care if he doesn't rate me? My missus isn't going to shag some retired creep if he asks nicely. I actually just confronted him about it when we came back for the day... Pretended he didn't know who he talks to. Whatever. We have decided to enjoy our 5th ywar together and rest assured I'll be asking the company who organises it for a  refund.
It's probably more common in London.
"I deliberately undertake people who cruise in the *normal* lane, but then again I am a bit of a cunt and can't be arsed weaving around for the sake of 1 car."
"I don't have a problem with up-selling as long as it's done respectfully as you do.

I.e. ""Would you like a balloon for £2?"" Fine.

""Remind me I've a balloon for you"" ""would you like a balloon?"" Hand it to the kid then ask for the money? Expect to have a dialogue."
"Should have invoiced them for your time as a subcontractor, plus a short notice fee and out of hours contract signing fee."
"I'm the opposite, I make a point of overtaking them and getting back into the inside lane. About 1 in 10 gets the hint."
I just don't like it when people use the kids as a sales tool. We all know say it to the kids and the kids are going to pester and it's mum and dad that end up being the bad guys.
"When it's a charge to cover such an intrinsic element of the service, it seems really weird to charge it separately. It's like bread being £1 a loaf, but then you get charged 20p for the crusts, or hiring a car and being charged extra for the seatbelts."
"It's not just london. That's a common thing in a lot of places.

As someone else stated if it's free its normally brought automatically. The exception to that rule is if they ask if you want a y tap water for the table, obviously that would be free... but water I.e. bottled wouldnt."
"I agree with everyone- both the middle and the outside lane are for overtaking, so you use the middle lane if you can, but often both the inside and middle lanes are full, so then you use the outside one.

If you are just cruising along, you are supposed to move back into the inside lane when you can, NOT stay in the middle lane. In fact, doing so when the inside lane is empty makes you a 'middle lane hogger' and that is now an offence."
I like your style.
A room ... I’ll just add. Renting a room. So if you want a house or even an entire flat to yourself. Double it if not more.
"One notable exception - the M8 in Glasgow between Charing cross and the cathedral turn off, the right hand lane in both directions is the exit.

"From the tropics the huge change will be how day length changes through the year.

"The war is heavily associated with Blair (one of the most disliked politicians) and some still hold prejudice against the Blairite wing of the Labour Party but not the whole party in general.

It was and still is seen as an American war and invasion is mostly seen as not justified but Parliament did vote to invade Iraq and officially declared war. Meaning joining the US on the frontline wasn’t just Blair’s fault."
"In principle, it's not such a bad thing, for JSA anyway. In practice, it was terrible."
"If there's a cover charge, one would expect something to be included, but these days, I don't think there is very often a cover charge."
"Sorry I’ve got to agree with the snobs ...
I feel more in control with a manual, I feel like I’m more connected to the car,
But it’s each to his own, some people prefer automatic because the technology is good, why not let the car choose the best gear?

Try an automatic, you might like it, if not go back to manual."
"I've been driving an automatic car for 20 years and find it much more relaxing.  
Before I switched, friends would say that it costs more to run an automatic or that they aren't as pokey as a manual or not as economical, but I didn't find that they were much different."
"&gt; because of the way marking is done you may not have even got any answer right in maths other than your name

This shows you up to be a moron.

&gt;The only answer that counts is the right one with no points for getting the answer wrong even though your working out was OK and in many job specific qualifications the minimum pass mark is 85%.

This confirms it.

You have no idea how hard the questions were. Comparing percentages across completely different tests is fucking stupid."
I didn’t mean to reply to you either but here we are.
"&gt;There's actually no part of the UK I think is bad....

🤔 Whilst that may be the general picture, there's definitely ""not nice"" areas in the UK!"
"Yeah it's pretty standard practice unfortunately. If something is free the waiter will just bring it to you and set it down on the table. If you are asked ""would you like x, y or z"" you're going to be paying for it.

Very little comes for free in London restaurants. One place even tried to charge me for tap water once."
The far right certainly are partial to overtaking
Yes you can. Even the most basic auto boxes have that facility.
"Mate, is there anywhere on reddit you aren't lmao. Swear I see your username everywhere."
"Where in England? North or South?

It’s gonna rain a lot and in winter it gets dark at around 4PM so expect to feel cold. 

Just bring coats, jumpers etc."
Most of the questions aren't multiple choice though
"Not really easier; just slightly more comfortable in stop start traffic.

I mean, given the option I'd get it for my work vehicle that I do most of my mileage in but it wouldnt exactly be a game changer for me."
"It's not normal for things like olives to be free. I do think this is a pretty underhand tactic to get you to spend more. If you get this again always ask if they are complimentary.

The only place I've experienced this happen regularly is in Indian restaurants where they ask if you want poppadoms.. These are rarely free as they come with assorted sauces."
Very common in my experience. Curry houses will always offer poppadoms when you sit down etc.
"I’ve got an automatic now after &gt;25 years manual. 

It’s easier in heavy traffic - gone is all that eventually going into second just as everyone brakes again. 

Cruise control on long motorway runs is easier too. 

Fuel consumption is allegedly worse, but I haven’t noticed much difference with my previous car that was a slightly older model of the same thing in manual 

Big change is loss of engine braking - you can’t supplement braking with changing down so I find you do have to use the brake pedal more."
"Absolutely, it was incredibly badly done. Imo, it should have been part time, ""community service"" style work. A few hours a week litter picking, volunteering or similar. Still gives you time to look for jobs and you're paying back the community, rather than working for free for a company."
You do realise you're being pedantic.
"If they ask you, it's probably not free.

If they just bring it and put it on the table without asking, in my experience it usually is."
...what? Yes it's normal.
"Fantastic reply, thank you very much."
22% is more nearer to 1/5th than 1/4 and represents no understanding of a subject. Statistically you'd be unlucky if you weren't able to get 1 in 6 right if it were multiple choice just by randomly choosing an answer.
"Saw a YouTube of an automatic ( Skoda Yeti, I think) driven by an experienced driver in auto and then manual modes from a standing start to 60mph. The auto was faster."

"I'm from London and whilst I love this city it can be a difficult place to live and can be emotionally, mentally and physically draining. If you're in a bit of a bad place at the moment I wouldn't recommend setting up shop here.

Edinburgh is a beautiful city and I find Scottish people are generally more welcoming and friendly than the English. That would be a better option I think although the weather is obviously shit.

One thing to consider is the impact that Brexit will have on you if you do decide to move to the UK. Take a look on the Home Office website for details but it's been a bit of a shit storm for EU citizens who have been living here for years so you'll need to make sure you have everything in order before coming over.

Good luck to you."
"She shouldn’t have left you all that poxy furniture, but from experience you’ll get bugger all money from them - when we moved in, we filled a 10 yard skip with the rubbish they left behind. It would have cost us more to pursue it than just pay for the skip :("
"After rent and essential bills (excluding food) I have nearly £800.

Out of that I have an FCP car (£200), insurance (£85) and then out of the remaining £515 I spend about £100 a week on food for two people and clothes/petrol/socializing. The £150 ish is for savings or big expenses that month like a service or birthday etc.

I would say I live very comfortably and I definitely spend on luxuries that I could cut back on in order to save more.

I’m slightly confused as to how you’re powering through that much when paying for one person?

Perhaps consider switching supermarkets? Just check where your money is going each month and figure out where you’re spending out the most?

"I would contact the local council's safeguarding team or check their website and ask their advice without giving the person's details unless they ask you to. Charities like Age UK may also be able to advise.

FYI, I work in healthcare and even we would usually need consent before making a referral regarding care for an adult. All adults and some children are assumed to have capacity to consent until proven otherwise. If nobody is abusing or neglecting this lady (other than herself) a best interests referral is unlikely to be possible based on the info you've given here. If you are unsure how to broach the subject with her or are not allowed to in your role, suggest she calls her GP or 111, or even transfer her through if she consents.

Your only other option is to report the abusive language to the police and hope they see it as a wellness issue.

"You mean the skills you'd gain if you just... did the minimum wage job?

Rather than getting paid peanuts to do the exact same job, with the exact same training, and prospects for career advancement, but be called an apprentice?

Apprenticeships are great for skilled professions, but utterly exploitative when they don't actually lead to skills and qualifications that allow the apprentice to advance their career beyond what they would have been likely to achieve without the apprenticeship.

Apprentice engineer: good.

Apprentice shelf stacker: cynical exploitation."
"It isn't normal at all. It's predatory.

"It can be hard to judge how difficult an exam is going to be for the intended audience without testing it on them (which they can't do with GCSE exams for obvious reasons), so sometimes they fuck up and make an exam much too easy/difficult and have to adjust the grade boundaries afterwards.

For example, I had an A level maths exam which I didn't quite manage to finish in the time available. It turns out that hardly anyone managed to finish all the questions - they had seriously underestimated how long some of them would take. Iirc I got 100% for that module, so clearly they adjusted the scores somehow.

So? Getting 1 in 5 questions right isn't necessarily easy if the questions are very difficult. Getting 100% right isn't necessarily difficult if the questions are very easy. The pass threshold by itself doesn't really tell you very much.

&gt; as long as it looked like the working out looked like you knew what you were doing.

Maths is all about coming up with and communicating proofs, so why wouldn't they award marks for that? The reason why there are marks for working isn't so that they can forgive minor mistakes - it's so that you learn to properly communicate what you're doing.

&gt; There's going to be a lot of school leavers finding the real world one hell of a shock. The only answer that counts is the right one with no points for getting the answer wrong even though your working out was OK and in many job specific qualifications the minimum pass mark is 85%.

I don't understand why so many people think schoolkids are coddled and aren't going to cope with the real world. Am I the only one who had a far harder time at school than I ever have since leaving it? I don't think I could cope with a workplace that had anything like the level of bullying and hostility that my primary school had, let alone my high school."
"Mills hill to victoria? Looks like the 7.22 ran on time but the 3 trains following it were cancelled, with the next train running at 9.34.

Hopefully that link takes you to the 7.22"
I'm going to take a punt that you've never studied statistics and are thus ignorant as to normalisation.
"It's not just a London thing as some in this thread are theorising. There's no reason for something like olives to be complementary, they aren't growing on the side of the pavement, they're imported.

The chain *La Tasca* does this as standard, and that's all over the country.

If it's already on the table when you get there or was given without you asking for it, it's likely complementary.

If they ask you if you want some and they haven't used the word 'complimentary', it's not complementary - they are taking an order."
I'm from near Leeds and we are often asked too when out to eat. It's always chargeable. It's never your small pubs or anything either. Usually the larger chains and posh establishments always offer that as your being seated.
"I think the Italian 'coperto' cover charge is slightly different - it's meant to cover overheads like crockery, condiments (and the bread). 

It's separate to a service charge or tip"
10 cents isn't unreasonable. Butter isnt as common in spain and portugal.
"&gt;Edinburgh is likely to be in the EU in years to come, where London won't be!

More likely, yes. Likely, no."
"Sounds like you’re being taken for a ride by the agency - is your tenancy agreement for a furnished or unfurnished property? What is written in your tenancy agreement? When an inventory of the property was carried out, were these items included? There are a whole host of ways you can verify responsibility here. 

To be honest, if turned up to a property and it was full of shit, I wouldn’t accept someone telling me “it was a gift” - that’s not how tenancies work. I turned around and say I assigned an agreement for an unfurnished property. And that’s what you will give me or I won’t move in!"
"Yep the important thing is that you're working towards a transferable qualification that will be useful in the industry you're working in, and preferably that they're guaranteeing you some study time to get it."
"The questions are decently hard. If you didn't know anything, you would get 0%. It's not multiple choice like a lot of American style class quizzes, and therefore there is no 'common sense' answer.



Plus, these students are studying often 9 or more GCSEs. They can't have perfect knowledge in everything. It's not like a job situation where it's one subject area with specific knowledge."
Wasn’t a Kappa jacket was it? That’s all that comes to mind when I think of the silhouette.
I think there's a minor downside in control at very low speeds but that's about it in good quality modern autos.
"The problem is your perception of a ‘decent standard of life’. Most people live absolutely fine on half the amount of disposable income after bills. But some people aren’t willing to give up takeaways most nights, eating out, trips to the cinema etc and so struggle. For some people not having a holiday abroad every year is unthinkable!"
Just wait until you get a car with distance-keeping cruise control + auto.  It's amazing in stop-start traffic.
"&gt; You need to be earning well over £3000 a month these days to live just reasonably. 

Spoken like someone who presumably lives in Central London. Otherwise, that's demonstrably false and one could easily live on half of that per month."
"One thing to add to the light situation is to mention that, especially if you have a lot of melanin in your skin, you may not produce enough Vitamin-D in the available daylight.  It might be a good idea to take some pure cod-liver oil or another natural source of the right kind of Vitamin-D to supplement what your skin produces. Some people get depressed when they don't get enough light, even the natives, so if this happens to you, see a Doctor."
Is a good resource
"Probably got 21% and is raging he didn't get that sweet, sweet F."
"Here is part of a letter from the BBFC to Edgar Wright, regarding use of the C word in The World's End: 
 
""As you say, we passed a single use in SHAUN OF THE DEAD because the use in question was throwaway, unthreatening, and essentially a term of endearment amongst friends (""Can I get any of you cunts a drink?""). In the case of HOT FUZZ we actually permitted two uses, one spoken and one written. First of all, we see the word 'cunt' on the list of prohibited terms on the swearbox in the police station and then we hear ""What a cunt"" when a man tells his friend about a man who sold drugs to kids. In the first case, the use was written (which reduces its impact) and of course lacked any aggression. In the second case, the use was not aggressive and was not personally directed but instead uttered about a person who is not present at the time.

So, the answer to your question is that it is possible to receive a '15' with three or four uses, provided they are not aggressive or threatening or complicated by any kind of power imbalance. However, it's best not to concentrate them together into a short outburst and we'd certainly caution against more than three or four uses.

I hope that's helpful to you."""
"Edinburgh is much better than London imho. Plus, Edinburgh is likely to be in the EU in years to come, where London won't be!"
"I think it's more than a bit cheeky given that small nibbles like that are usually included in the cover charge, but if an explicit listing is in the menu (and was sufficiently prominent that you could/should have noticed it) then it's probably ""enforceable"" as it were."
"It's a phone stand. Stick it on sideways and it will hold a phone up on a desk, easier to hold when your lying down too. Dunno why it needs a card holder though."
"Do you know what? I just assumed they'd be closed tomorrow which is why I asked here, but it turns out they are open so I'll give them a call in the morning and update my post with what they say. Thanks."
"How was it worded exactly? Worded that way, I'd assume complimentary. Worded anything like, ""would you like anything while you wait? Maybe some olives or something?"" then it would definitely not come across as being free."
"39 mate, sure I'll figure it out shortly."
Why thank you. Dad raised me proper like
