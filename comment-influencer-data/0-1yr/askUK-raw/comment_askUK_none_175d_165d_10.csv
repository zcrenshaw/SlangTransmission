Of Mice And Men is the only answer (also An Inspector Calls).
Don't have kids but I wouldn't give my cousin any sweets or crisps until he stopped asking me for candy and chips. I might be a bellend but I'll teach him properly.
You’re a bellend but a correct bellend. 
"That the IT teacher was sleeping with the students. 

He was. 

He was jailed. "
Uber asks for proof of insurance. Insurance which covers for delivering is expensive. So you sign up saying you have a bike and then use your car.

Yeah but she said she’d divorce me if I called her that again. Weheay...
"Yeah, I live in a small market town in Yorkshire and there's like 8. My current semi serious/semi joking theory is that they're there for the same reason everywhere seems to have 20 vape shops with no one in them. Money laundering."
"Lord of the Flies. Not out of choice, I might add."
You can talk about anything you like. The Samaritans are really helpful. I used to work the phones for them. You can say as much or as little as you want. They might ask you why you’re calling or if anything has happened to cause you to call and how you’re feeling. 
"This bothers me too. 

My sister-in-law cannot seem to get anywhere on time. Family dinners, events etc., she is always 30 minutes to an hour late. 

The most irritating thing is she doesn't give a shit. So what if the food you cooked is dry and cold now. So what if you've all been standing to wait for over half an hour. 

She is a general C\*\*T though, to be fair. "

My eldest once referred to chips as 'fries'. He now lives with his Grandmother.
"forgot the liverpudlian RE teacher that used to go into the supply closet for a weird amount of time and very often, so of course kids made jokes about him rubbing out a quick one, became a running joke...

then a student actually opened the door while he was in there. when you gotta wank, you gotta wank, i guess."

"What's more likely is that it's one of the few high street businesses left that still has little/no online competition. If anything, the Internet will have boosted specialist barber services. "
Once while working in America a Israeli played the line “Never have I ever had sex with 3 midgets” we all looked at her and she just responded with “well the circus was in town”.
"Take car. Go to mum's. Kill Phil, grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over."
"Rumor was that the headmaster was a paedophile.

10 years after I left a former student beat the crap out of him with a cricket bat. Turned out he was a paedophile."
Also all major supermarkets do home delivery for a small fee.
"Maybe the private school bit is true (don't know, no experience of that) but the state school bit isn't. The problem with state schools is not that they are engineered as factories to produce obedient workers but rather that they are pulled in all directions by all kinds of ""stakeholders"" who want them to be different and entirely contradictory things and that different groups of these ""stakeholders"" are given free reign to completely upend things with every cabinet shuffle.

Realistically education should be as politically independent as at least the Bank of England to prevent that sort of thing but well... it's clear where the priorities lie."
"Also, it's called 'Never have I ever'"
"As a former Samaritans volunteer, I suggest simply calling. The person on the other end won't expect anything from you. Say whatever you feel you want to say, or alternatively don't feel bad about saying nothing at all. So you can just ring and see what comes of the call.

All the best"
"Was about to say I think my school class was one of the only ones that *didn't* read Of Mice And Men. 

We did do An Inspector Calls though."
"Ed Sheeran would be Nandos. Inexplicably popular, seems like the real deal to teenagers."
Neckbeard effect. Like Lynx effect. Only different.
"Because you're coming into r/AskUK and ""correcting"" a UK brand to what it's sold as outside the UK like a massive bell-end."
"Greggs is basically a cafe. Aldi is one of the cheapest retailers, together with Lidl. Tesco is one of the big 4 supermarkets (Sainsburys, Asda, Morrison), and Waitrose and M and S are next upmarket.

Without a car? usually, backpacks- shopping bags on wheels are for old people- a lot of people do a big shop and then call a minicab (often a phone in the supermarket).

Furniture- TONS of retailers, including charity shops (I think you call them thrift shops)- Oak Furniture Land, jysk, next, M and S, John Lewis, are all OK.

TV- all have a way of getting our free-to-air channels, but you need a TV licence (can do online). No separate box unless you want to record, like a PVR/ DVR."
Never have I ever had a sex dream about someone in this room - always leads to a good bit of awkwardness
"Used to work for GAME, personal favourite was testing a Sony PSP and the memory card which had been left in the console was full of the amateur porn collection of the couple trading it in. Wouldn’t have been that bad if she didn't look like something one of the Jeremy Kyle researchers had dragged in off the street."
"Got a few:

First was when I was at a boarding prep school in Surrey. It was an old spooky mansion on a hill surrounded by woodland. So obviously there was a story about it being haunted. Some kids, in all seriousness claimed to have heard screaming at night, and others claimed to have literally seen a ghost. They were shit up enough that the deputy head took them seriously and looked for an explanation.

The screams and the 'ghost' were actually two different things.

The screaming was from the French teacher, who had a room in the main part of the school. He'd been an SOE operative in the second world war and had been caught with his radio, and had to strangle the person that caught him to death with the headphone cable. He was a very heavy drinker and smoker and had terrible nightmares about his experiences in the war, particularly killing someone with his bare hands. We were told about this as an explanation for the screaming, to reassure us that it wasn't a ghost.

Then, the deputy head (who was also a science teacher) replicated the 'ghost' that the kids saw.

There was a long drive, going downhill, leading up to the front of the school. The main school building had a large feature window, with some stained glass elements. I forget the exact details, but if a car when down the drive at night a certain way - which wasn't the normal one, but if two cars had to move slightly differently to pass each other at the same time, or something like that - then the headlights would shine through the windows and project a moving light onto the wall behind them, which if you viewed it from below, looked like a bright ghostly figure moving quickly.

So, yeah, there wasn't a 'ghost', but it wasn't kids just making shit up either. 

The next school I went to had so many scandals and dodgy teachers that it's barely worth mentioning all of them, but one of the 'myths' was that there were tunnels under the school, and that all the teachers were in a weird cult.

The tunnels were actually real. They were service tunnels with loads of pipes and cables in. The school was huge, but consisted of a massive main block and then eleven boarding houses. The service tunnels had pipes which took hot water from another large central works department to the boarding houses, and these tunnels were probably an easier way of access to them for maintenance than burying them would be. They were closed down and sealed off because they were full of asbestos, but there were still a few ways into them, and I actually did go down into them to have a look around. They weren't big enough to walk through, but you could scoot yourself along on a skateboard. I sort of regret doing this now, but hey, no mesothelioma yet!

The teachers being in a weird cult was also kiiiinda true, as there was a masonic lodge attached to the school, and the dining hall and other parts of the school were used for large meets where different lodges came together to do whatever it is they do.  "
"I bought some sausage meat and made my own. Added some salt, white pepper and I think a bit of sage. Turned out pretty well. "
"Not necessarily correct then, just let them know. They're interested in knowing.

"Of mice and men.

"I went to a Church of England co-ed school and left 5 years ago now I think? It wasn't that bad. I got teased a lot in the beginning by the other boys (I was outed in year 8 / 9), the changing rooms were a nightmare, but by sixth form no one really treated me any differently. I didn't have a lot of straight guy friends though - pretty sure they all assumed I would prey on them.

I imagine schools are only getting more progressive and more accepting. That's my hope anyway. "
"Shrew. Like the small animal.

Shakespeare did not write ""the taming of the shrow""."
"It is 100% disrepectful. Simple as that.

Clearly depends on the exact situation because arriving for a party, it is 'normal' to be late. But being late to a 2 person event just means you dont rate that person.

That's life though. More powerful people DONT respect less powerful people (as much) so they wont be on time if it inconveniences them."
"I used to work for Cash Generator years and years ago, it was a real learning experience for young Hetty.

One sad and yet positive experience occured when an elderly chap came in to sell an old Atari games console. Now young Hetty was a big retro geek and was quite excited to see this console, we talked for a little while and he explained he was hard up and needed to sell it. Unfortunately we never sell anything remotely exotic, mostly TVs and heaters (etc) - never a old school Atari. To this old chap I had to basically say, look it's worth money but we can't buy it - can you try X,Y,Z? It was pretty heart breaking given he clearly needed the cash.

Just before closing later than day the old man came back and literally gave it to me - sadly he wasn't able to sell it anywhere I recommended. 

It was a really bitter-sweet day.

Pawn brokers are a tough place to work if you have any kind of soul, seen so many desperate people trying to scratch together ANYTHING. It was a real life learning experience - one of the best and worst jobs I've ever done."
"My school did To Kill a Mockingbird or Of Mice and Men. Half the year did one, the other half did the other"
"Honestly if you have short hair, what's the point even going. Bought a 30 quid Wahl electric razor 6 years ago and have just been maintaining my fade every other day since.

Can also trim my balls too, which I've learnt is not an acceptable request of most barber shops."

You've waited 3 years for your moment and you took it.  Bravo. 
"As someone who works in Recruitment for a company who takes on a lot of graduates, I find it very frustrating if someone has accepted our offer then pulls out at the 11th hour because it's a reasonable of work behind the scenes setting up onboarding, contracts, etc etc plus I've got quotas, expectant hiring managers and the like. 

However, this is why I get what I get paid, and your first graduate job is an important choice (although if you take the wrong role and then subsequently move, that's not the end of the world by any means) and as someone else rightly said, you owe us very little really. If we lost the funding for your role, we'd can you without a second thought so makes sense for you to approach us in the same manner.

TL;DR Should you accept an offer knowing you will go back on it if something better comes up?

Well no, but actually yes."
"Not really - I kind of can’t be bothered to take it personally. I’ll just read a book on my phone or something.

What I really hate is people who turn up early. Especially if they then imply you’re late when you’re on time!"
I suspect it is because the trend just now with men is the skin fade type haircuts. To maintain a decent fade you need to be getting your haircut every 2 weeks hence more demand for barbers.

"I feel like the only person in the country who had to read neither of them at school. Half of our year did Of Mice And Men.

"My husband is American and I have one kid born in each country so honestly we just embrace the blended linguistics. I lived in the US my entire adult life and tend to use the word I prefer from each country if I'm not thinking about it. If I am bring more careful I tailor it to my audience.

My kid who is old enough to talk has a bit of confusion in places, like she started calling diapers/nappies ""dappies"" for a little bit after we moved here and our new baby was born. But I'm not really bothered one way or another which words she chooses. Both are valid given our family story. If that's as confused as she gets it'll be a blessing, tbh--we also spent two years in Germany and now she has Scottish words to contend with. She hates being called ""wee"", according to her nursery. ;)"

"Eh, kinda, everyone knows that the ‘correct’ opinion is that there’s nothing wrong with being gay and if you state a homophobic opinion to a room, you will probably be argued with. That doesn’t mean there isn’t homophobia. ‘Gay’ is still fairly widely used when joking as an insult and if someone does something slightly gay, someone will say that’s ‘kinda sus’. Plus, in regular group discussion, when the topic comes up, people freely share insane homophobic opinions, ranging from “I wouldn’t want my child to be gay” to “Oh I’m Russian, of course I hate the gays”. And people accept that as a valid opinion. I am absolutely pro immigration and everything but I would be lying if I said that had nothing to do with it. Some other cultures aren’t accepting of homosexuality and that message gets passed on to their kids. It’s pretty sad hearing people you think are your friends saying they’d disown their child if they were gay. But things have definitely improved on the whole, I’m out at school and nothing bad has happened so far. I know a bunch of other open LGBT people and nothing bad has happened to them. Homophobes are afraid to share their views and I think that’s a good thing. But that’s just my experience, I’m in Year 10 and go to school in North London, who knows what it’s like elsewhere."
"Unrelated to never have i ever (sorry) but a great game I enjoy that quickly becomes NSFW (but can also be quite wholesome) is mr and mrs! you don't have to be a couple, just two people who know each other to a varying degree. Sit back to back, both contestants have drinks in hand and the rest of the group asks them questions where they either agree or disagree. E.g. who is better at this, who can handle their drink, who's kinkier etc. 

If one person thinks they are the one who can drink more or whatever, THEY drink. If the other person thinks actually they're the one who's better, they also drink. This is a disagreement. If one person drinks to a question and the other doesn't, that is an agreement. The goal is to get to five agreed questions in a row. A disagreed question sets the score back to 0!

Have had this turn sour on a very rare occasion, so don't be a huge knob with questions."

My friend’s stolen phone resurfaced in one and she got it back. So their checks do work to an extent it seems. I presume they check anything with a serial number that might be implicated in a crime.
"People don't go bankrupt from medical bills in the UK. That's a horrific concept which you Americans seem to think is OK. Bankruptcy from taxes? How does that even work?

I don't work and therefore don't pay taxes. 

I was diagnosed with cancer. Within two weeks of diagnosis I had a meeting with a consultant gynae-oncologist and scans etc were arranged. A week later we had a meeting with a multidisciplinary team of surgeons, oncologists and specialist nurses to discuss treatment options.

I had surgery within a month (with some complications, unfortunately) and a hospital stay. I didn't have a fancy private room, but I was in a decent side-ward with three other ladies. Apart from the staff being obviously over-worked I had no concerns about the care I received.

What did we have to pay? Well, my husband had to pay a few quid for hospital parking.

As far as taxes go: I pay nothing. That is because I earn nothing - by choice (I'm lucky). My husband pays taxes, but nothing we would consider outrageous or extortionate. I would have received the same care whether I was on benefits.

I find the 'I'm alright Jack, fuck you' attitude of some Americans to healthcare for all to be **utterly** barbaric.

I'm happy for some of our money to go to help people who need it. Who knows - tomorrow it might be you with the broken back, or shattered leg, or twisted intestine etc etc.

"We did ""Lord of the Flies"".

It's actually not too bad if you read it at your own pace.  

If you go through it at typical GCSE English pace (glacially slow, stopping at every sentence to analyse what Golding was trying to represent), by the time you get halfway through the book you've forgotten what it was about."
"Quite tame compared to some of the other comments on here but we had an IT teacher leave our school one day without a trace, rumours went around that he'd been sharing child pornography with the other teachers in the school. Found out a few years later from a teacher that he'd accidentally hit send to all on an email from his personal account and sent a pretty large porn collection (though nothing illegal unlike the rumours) to every member of staff in the school and had quit his job out of embarrassment."

"I was the grain of truth in a rumour. I was chatting with the teenage child of a friend of mine, who went to the same school as we had been as kids. Looking for common for something to talk about, I started telling him old urban legends from when I was there and asking him if they still told them. After a bit of back and forth he starts telling me this story about a girl that tried to murder the daughter of the headmaster with a hockey stick.

It was at this point that I realised that the time I dislocated two fingers of the step-daughter of the head of middle school by perfectly reasonable mistake during a hockey match had... Grown."

"I think we have the same sister in law. She was late to her own wedding because she didn't even start getting ready til 30 minutes before she was due to walk down the aisle, she had done a practise run of all the hair and make up stuff, so she knew it would take nearly two hours. But for some unknown reason she just didn't start on time? 

I've lost count of the number of times she has made the rest of us late for movies/shows etc, last time it happened I left without her. She knew we had to be on the bus by 6, so she went for a shower at 5.50. Apparently she was still in the shower at 6.30, and wasn't dressed until 7, which was when the show started. Then she got upset at the rest of us because we left and she missed the show.

She doesn't talk to me much anymore, and I am glad of it."
