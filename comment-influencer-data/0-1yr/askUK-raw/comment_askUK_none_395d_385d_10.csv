"I saw ainsley on a plane when I was 4. He had a Hawaiian shirt on.

It’s not really relevant, but I thought I’d share."
"Less annoyed with GDPR, more annoyed with many website shit design choices to deal with it. Plenty of places make it unobtrusive, so why can't they all?"
"Yes.

My experience is that it's a ratio of about 2:3:1 actively useless/mostly competent/positively good.

It's the main reason I ended up plumbing all my own bathrooms and installing my own double glazing and learning to plaster etc etc etc.  Possibly it would have been easier to just put more effort into finding a reliable set of tradespeople, but they seemed so few &amp; far between that I stopped bothering."
"If you're a good fisherman with top-notch survival skills, you could probably manage it on one of the more remote Scottish islands. Other than that, the UK is really too small to escape society.

Although, aside from the law, modern society is only as much of a prison as you make it in your mind."
"Seeking legal advice isn't suing them, just seeking advice about what you can do to protect yourself."

No. They are required to give you minimum 11 hours between shifts. What industry is she in?
Custard creams. No contest.

"A lot of Brits find your system idiotic (myself included) if a tip is mandatory then it's not a tip. 

Waiters still make relatively low wages here of around £8-10 an hour plus tips, systems vary but many places pool the tips and you get a cut of that - there's been various controversies about companies keeping tips paid by cards, taking a cut of them for management charges etc. "

"&gt; She didn't put our deposit in a mutual fund

You don't put it in a mutual fund, you put it under a deposit protection scheme. If she's failed to do that, you've already got your case sorted."
"I work there. Smart shoes, trousers and a smart shirt. That will do. "
"The European Working Time Directive, ladies and gentlemen.  It’s a good thing, we ought to keep it.

"Not a contestant but I’ve worked with Ainsley before on a few shows I’ve worked on. He’s been absolutely lovely every single time and always so bubbly and smiley - basically like he is on TV! 

 Anyone who wanted a photo in the street he would happily oblige. I was with him once when he was recording messages from an old couple in the street and he said FookinBlinders I can see you wanting to ask but you’re probably not allowed to, so I’m telling you to, and he recorded a message to my mother wishing her happy birthday as she worshipped him and it melted her heart. 

He is so nice to the crew, from the top like the Execs to the runners making the teas. He genuinely appreciates that people like him and doesn’t take it for granted at all. Absolute golden egg."
"Middlesbrough. I work for an events company that sells clothes and the theft in Middlesbrough was fucking rampant. If you just stopped for 5 minutes to stand in a corner and watch everyone, you'd just see folk nicking stuff left, right &amp; centre. People putting stuff on, people filling backpacks, carrier bags, people trying to walk out with stuff. The third event, we had a strict no backpacks or large carry bags rule, so we ended up with a pile of backpacks we promised to guard at the front door which was a massive hassle. And when people realised we'd got a lot more security keeping tabs on folk, they just left. We found piles of clothes where people had picked stuff out to nick, realised they were being watched, and they'd just dumped them. And at that point we ended our contract with the venue and we will not return. It's sad, because I get a lot of social media requests for a return, but fuck that. "
Buy a bag for life.
"OP doesn't know, he wasn't really focussing"
"&gt; which basically all goes to taxes when we declare our tips

A small thing that no-one else has mentioned is that one doesn't pay any income tax on the first £11,850 of annual earnings (approximately $15,250), so not only do minimum-wage servers earn more here than in the United States, they're unlikely to deduct nearly as much tax from it."

"I’m a UK citizen and have always kept it in the cupboard at room temp.

Talk to the union and check the staff handbook. If they're not following the correct procedures it's grounds for appeal and possibly a formal grievance.

Yeaaaaaaaah no."
"I was a contestant. 

1. I was invited on as a special guest. They used occasionally to do themed shows. I was invited on one of these. (Not saying more to keep anonymity.)

2. Yes the cooking time was as per timer BUT there was a pause between the ingredients reveal and the start of the cooking. Bit of thinking time. Only about 5-10 mins. 

3. I wasn’t a fan of my chef but to be fair no one’s at their best when under that kind of pressure. Not one of the favourite personalities on the show anyway. The food he produced was pretty weak TBH and we rightly lost. He didn’t let me do very much at all. Just chopped some nuts.

4. Didn’t know what would be cooked beforehand. The ingredients thing is semi-real. You list a load of things you like as a shortlist and they select the actual items for the bag. Fair enough, to ensure contrast between the pairs and other episodes. 

5. Ainsley was a trooper. Very pro, working despite having a stinking cold. Warm and one hell of a lot of energy. I came out way more of a fan than when I went in. 

Hope that covers it. "
"No it isn't, you need to put yourself in the correct mindset that the NHS is your employer. Don't set yourself on fire to keep them warm, the monetary damage you could do to them over this is infinitesimal compared to their funding."
"I’m almost positive that’d lead to a ‘hey [creepy scumbag], take a look at this order? Why has this customer asked for you to not do the delivery?’ sort of conversation.  
  
If you’re using a service and that guy’s employed to carry out that service and involves using your address, there’s nothing you’ll be able to do to be *sure* that he won’t run into it. "
"I've worked for a long time in elderly care and I'm now a nail technician, before I was on minimum wage and on a good day now depending on what service I'm giving I can make upwards of £35 an hour. I'm outside of London but in London I know some nail techs that can charge £50 for a fresh set of acrylics. Better hours and not wiping up poo. I know which I'd choose. "
I'm betting she's in social care.
"The top 3 news results from Google after I searched Luton as of now:

- Airport shuttle driver stole £38k in fares
- Man gets nightmare after being smashed over the head by a laptop at Luton airport 
- A Kosher slaughterhouse containing screaming animals to be opened by a school"
"The quality of the actual broadband is really dictated by Openreach (unless you use someone with their own lines like Virgin) so it mostly down to quality of customer service - I've always found Plusnet to be pretty good compared to most, they tend to respond quickly and keep you updated.  The staff on the phone are generally helpful as well, although they can sometimes take a while to answer calls.  In my opinion you won't find anyone else who is significantly better and there are a lot who are very much worse."
"I've tried everything, the squeegee is the only thing that worked. That or scrubbing the bejeesus out of it with Viakal every weekend"
"Tell her you want to know what scheme it was deposited with as you want to dispute, and mention you don't recall receiving the deposit confirmation letter as required by law.

This way it's not really very threatening and she will be more willing to work with you, since she won't want to admit that she could owe you 3x your deposit back."
"As in off the grid with solar panels and wind turbine?
That's quite easy, once its set up and getting much more common.

Growing your own food like the good life?
Needs a bit more land, an acre or so.

"£10 an hour? Thats not relatively low at all.

Most regular staff in hospitality take home min wage which is what, £7.50 ish an hour?

Only positions like chefs and managers get a semi decent wage."

"The smartest stuff you have will do fine.

No-one expects a person of your age to own expensive suits and stuff.

I am sure they will try to put you at your ease, knowing you are young."
If you can prove that it's bullying you might consider a formal grievance against the people doing it. They'd have to explain to an investigating manager the reasons for their behaviour.
"&gt;There are two types of people from Gillingham: those who leave and those who stay.

I mean, yeah. That's true about a lot of places."
Maybe that's where your work's network is based? If I open it on my laptop it defaults to central London when I'm actually in Edinburgh. 
Probably not off the top of our heads but we'd know if you were making one up.
"&gt;""we don't tip this much back home"" as an excuse to leave me 10%

We genuinely don't. I never tip unless I thought it was exceptional service / food, it has to have gone above and beyond what I'd expect to get a tip."
"Going for an interview at Sainsbury’s?

"The famous Dambusters raid in WW2 used code words for the crews to radio back when each target was destroyed. One dam destruction had the code ""nigger"" named after the CO's much-loved black dog, which had become the squadron mascot. When Peter Jackson was trying to remake the classic film recently there was much controversy when he decided to rename the dog to avoid that bit of history. The dog's gravestone is still in situ at the site of the airfield. 

That said it wasn't as racially charged as in the US, as GIs found when they tried to introduce segregation into British bars for the first time in the build up to Overlord. In the ensuing brawls (and occasional shoot out) they were shocked to find the locals and British troops almost invariably taking the side of the Black GIs. "
"&gt;your smartest shoes

And clean them."
"&gt;I am hesitant to take legal action as its the its just too unethical to sue the NHS, that and I'd almost certainly lose too.

As a Taxpayer i disagree.... just becasue you work for a government funded organisation doens't mean it can skirt around the employment laws everyone else must follow, otherwise all nhs staff, civil servants, teachers etc are all fucked (more than they already are). your case will cost peanuts compared to the overall NHS budget and i garuantee they budget for legal costs and employment disputes, every company does.

Obviously you haven't said the kind of things you're being reported for so it's hard for us to judge, but even if they follow all the legally mandated processes for firing someone, if you can prove it was pre-meditated or that most of the reporting were false and the others you can't prove didn't happen but they can't prove did other than your word vs theirs, then you have a lawsuit to file. The only way they could prove it would be if there was CCTV of your work when you were commiting the offences. Certainly worth talking to a lawyer now."

"No, if anything i'm even more privacy aware. I'm glad this legislation exists, things are way out of hand atm.

Now opening any new websites to read a single article, I usually just open in incognito tab and click accept all. "
"If you are serious about finding someone, then pay for it becuase the free results are often incomplete, out of date or simply don't exist. There are many options so you could shop around to find the cheapest."
"Same way they afford anything in life, don't spend on X, to save for Y. 

Really the answer is different priorities. I know many friends who're married but live in rented properties, and they spent 5 figures."

"Shit ones - yes, absolutely.

God ones - no, not at all.

The challenge is finding the latter and, fuck me, it's a challenge. When I started a big renovation project I thought I could hit up a couple of mates who are in trade for contacts and most of them didn't want to recommend anyone.

Had a ""mate of a mate"" chippie recommended to me, so I tried him - installing a new door frame. I turn up and it's blatantly, visually completely not fucking square. I called him up, he basically tried to deny it, I lost my cool, he came and fixed it and I never spoke to him again.

On the other hand, I've got a trusted builder that I've used for some heavier bits (Namely, an RSJ install, bit of a brick work etc) who came around, spent 20 minutes explaining an issue to me and told me how to fix it myself. Guess which one has done work at whole bunch of my friends and families houses!

From your description, it sounds like you're talking about ""handymen""? I'm a bit biased because I do all that stuff myself, but IMHO, they tend to be the worst for having a go at jobs they can't competently do. Probably a bit over harsh, but I'd expect decent ones to be doing, well, something else. It's an unfortunate gap in the market, really - smaller jobs that decent chippies and general builders don't really want so it's naturally left to the people who are perhaps less able.

When you find a decent tradesman, treat them like fucking Kings and hold on to them because they are not easy to track down."

"There's some guidance here:

A lot of it hinges on how long you've been with the company - you don't get many rights until you've been there more than two years.

Note, that gross misconduct usually means something major, like turning up drunk, bullying someone, stealing from the workplace, etc.  Excessive internet use should just be a slap on a wrist, and a ""please stop doing it"""

Is SG 3 a Credit Standard Grade or General Standard Grade?

"As long as she gets what's called 'compensatory rest' afterwards, yes it is legal.

My fiancé was in this exact situation with his last job, so we looked into it. Yes, you are entitled to 11 hours rest between shifts, however if this isn't possible then you are owed compensatory rest for the time you missed to be taken afterwards. In this case, as long as there were 14 hours between the end of the 7am shift and her next shift, this is legal."
"Health and social care level 2 - quite often it's free. 

To be fair, working in beauty would give you much more money and is less mentally &amp; physically exhausting. Many of my clients moved on from being a carer to jobs in beauty."
