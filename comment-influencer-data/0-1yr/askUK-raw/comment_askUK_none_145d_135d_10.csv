"&gt; He thinks I’m lying and trying to get pregnant

Whether contraception is free or not is not the main issue here."
"Counter, worktop, possibly a table some sort of flat surface."
"Because most schools are now academies and not council run. Academies are businesses and often they have deals with suppliers. They make money from strict uniform policy as it can only be sourced from their preferred supplier and not from local supermarkets etc. They will talk about discipline, respect, zero tolerance and being ready for the world of work, but the truth is it's about money."
"This is surprisingly more common than you think. There are back billing rules, which means the company cannot legally charge you for more than 12 months worth of bills, because it was their fault. 

[Here's](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/energy/energy-supply/problems-with-your-energy-bill/you-havent-received-a-gas-or-electricity-bill-in-a-while/) some more info"
"I think it's amazingly rude to take plates during the meal- it makes me feel like attention is drawn to the fact that I eat fast, and it makes slower eaters feel rushed. 

I don't mind them taking serving plates if they're empty, but dinner plates really irritates me."
"Explain that I was on my lunch break, that's why I'd asked how long food would be, and that I now wouldn't be able to wait any longer as they'd failed to meet the expectations that they had set. Get refund, grab a sandwich from the cornershop on the way back to the office."
"Worst - bringing in food for every fucking thing... Oh you went on holiday? Better bring something, oh someone is doing a bake sale every week? Gotta being something. Oh and don't you dare forget to bring treats in for your own birthday! 

Best - definitely the banter. No way I could say all of this stuff back in the States."
"If he thinks so lowly of you, get out now, don't look back. Run!"
"I think it's not an actual law, more like a scheme that shops sign up to."
"Each course should be cleared once everyone has finished.  
You go at the pace of the slowest diner."
"Baby steps, start by going down the shops, nipping to the post office etc. Get the human interaction back and then when you feel comfortable around people then look towards education or a job / mature aprenteship."
"Aldi. I like the Lidl bakery, but everything else at Aldi is better quality, including the packaged bread. The Aldi malted bloomer loaf makes cracking toast."
Just do what you want!
"If you enjoy it, it's not time-wasted, even if it is ""nothing."""
You must have used something extremely unwise if you're too embarrassed to even tell strangers online what you cleaned the screen with.
 Emergency contraception is free in the UK. Most contraception is free on the NHS in the UK.
It exists but it's generally very uncommon. Mostly occupational requirements only.
"I heard there was a secret loaf  
That Aldi baked, that made cracking toast  
But you don't really care for baked goods, do ya?  
It goes like this: some flour, some yeast  
Mix up with water, add some heat  
The frenzied bakers making Malted Bloomer  
Malted Bloomer, Malted Bloomer  
Malted Bloomer  
Malted Bloo-oomerrr"
Japanese knotweed.
"I doubt it's the kids at school but almost certainly a scam she's running with someone taking the photos for her. Either way, report it."
Well obviously. It's where stuff is put. What kind of upbringing have these people had?
"Tell them to cancel the order and refund my money  
A wait is expected but that's why you call and pay in advance.  
For them to then take over double the suggested time to still not have presented you with your order is a piss take particularly when they know it's a lunchtime order and people don't have the luxury of waiting around."
"I think they're also very keen to be seen to be making changes when they come in, and uniform standards are much easier to ""fix"" quickly than structural issues."
"I've never been anywhere in the UK where they've taken my plate before everyone has finished.

My Dad has dementia and he takes a long time to eat. We all finish before him when I take him out and he says sorry it's taking so long for him. Lots of reassuring comments and he's fine.

If anyone tried to take our plates before he'd finished, I'd tell them to come back later. He'd be really stressed thinking he was holding everyone up.

That's an extreme example, but it's really rude to start clearing before everyone has finished."
Maybe start a bitcoin mining operation on the down low
I'm with you. I'd be fine if they were a normal volume but they always seem to pick ridiculous amplifiers for tiny rooms.
"**Best**: The people, naturally! From a work perspective, the job market is so much bigger because it's a much bigger country than the one I've come from. I work for a global country that employs over 65,000 people around the world, which I still find mindblowing. Also the sheer amount of stuff you can do and buy. Want to go see an eight hundred year old castle? Easy. Want to go see a cutting edge play? Easy. Want to go to a great gig? Easy. Want to buy a new piece of furniture? There are heaps of physical stores plus all the places you can buy from online. Easy. 

**Worst**: Brexit."
"If you pay £500, they will ask for another £500, and another, until you can't pay anymore. Because they don't have a reason to stop once you make the first payment."
"No shame mate, I say embrace it. And yes, report it to the police if you think it's a genuine threat."
"Nice. 

Keep it up.

&gt;Beat alcoholism with this one UNBELIEVABLE trick ~op.

Some people find picking up a new (non-drink related) hobby might help. Gym or something like that might be nice if you're looking to reform your body.

We no doubt look forward to hearing about your continuing success in a few months."
"As someone who used to live in a seaside town, and now lives in the middle of the fens, I can say for relative certainty that whatever social norm there is goes right out the window as soon as the great ball of fire appears.

In all seriousness, you do you. You're a grown ass woman, if you don't want to wear one, then don't wear one.

Asked my wife as well... ""Well, if she doesn't want to, it's not like someone is going to tell her off in public about it. If she doesn't want nipple outlines, maybe tape or something?"""
Or grow room full of tomatoes
"&gt; bringing in food for every fucking thing

&gt; definitely the banter.

haha, we had a new guy start today.

Me: ""Hi, welcome to the team. What food did you bring?"""
"Best: dark British humour. People make jokes here that could mean subtle hints/ insinuations that very funny and brutal, but they are not taken offensively because it's a ""joke"". So you laugh and worryingly reflect about it. 
Worst: I think people here can get quite aggressive when drunk. Some people ( not everyone) drink to get too fucked up and not really enjoy themselves and they just get a bit paranoid and aggressive."
"Having worked in the City, if a company wanted to cut staff levels, a random drug test would probably be the most effective way to do it haha."
"They're public sector weeds, they'll get round to growing but it'll inexplicably take years to do something that doesn't seem that difficult."
"Not necessarily, but it depends a lot on your office environment. Are you working alone, with one other or a team? Does the phone ring often/people come in to ask questions? Is there general chatter between fellow staff or do you work in silence?

&amp;#x200B;

From my time as an IT tech, I spent a lot of time working alone when I would listen to music. If somebody else was in the office with me I wouldn't, in case we needed to discuss something. It has a lot to do with image as well - if somebody walks into your office to speak with you, if you have earbud(s) in, that may put them off."
Everyone had blazers when i was at secondary school wth the rules you mentioned. Six form had no uniform but it was a sixth form college
"Obviously as 3V3RTON says, it's not well thought but some factors at play:

\-Price, energy drinks are pretty cheap and so are more easily afforded by teenagers than a starbucks anything.

\-Accessibility, It's easier to drop into a supermarket/corner shop/express store on your way to school than to go into town and wait in line at a coffee shop.

\-Taste, I know this doesn't apply to all but to most younger teenagers, if you have the choice between bitter coffee or a fruity fizzy sugary syrup, which one do you think you'd go for?

&amp;#x200B;

I mention teenagers because I assume this is who the law was primarily targeting."
"I got it from Boots twice, once in 2012 at age 28, and another time a few years earlier, and both times it was free under a local scheme. Your boyfriend doesn’t know what he’s talking about. 

And, it’s none of my business, but if it was up to me, I’d be having serious thoughts about a man who accused me of being a liar over something like this. If you weren’t telling the truth, that would be a serious breach of trust, and the fact that he thinks you’re capable of that doesn’t say awesome things about your relationship."
"They might have , they can split, chill out."
"Listen to audio books in your car of different things. Auditory downtime is the only thing you can do in your car.

If you’re travelling that far though unless it’s a dream job id be looking elsewhere"
"I assume ""sideboard"" is where it came from. Or did that name come from things being on the side?"
"Whatever you decide on, buy some tarpaulins you can throw over them when it's too cold or wet to sit outside. It'll last longer *and* save you hosing all the dust and bird shit off them when the sunny weather starts up again."
That's impossible.  The moment you plant them here they become British poppies.
"The MAP didn't used to be free at Boots or other pharmacies, the dispensing rules changed fairly recently I think to bring it under the same charging system as regular contraception but allow pharmacies to dispense without a Dr."
"Yeah it's generally only done for certain professions. Police, fire service, any driving job etc.

You wouldn't get random testing in an office unless the company had some money to burn."
"Just to add this, in October 2015 the Competition &amp; Markets Authority felt compelled to right an [open letter](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-advises-schools-and-suppliers-over-uniform-prices) to schools to highlight the anti competitive practices surrounding school uniforms. It has been summarily ignored, with no consequences."
Are kids really looking for bang-for-buck caffeine hits though or just drinking Monster because they like the taste?
"Consider volunteering somewhere, it'll show potential employers that you can keep to commitments while also giving you something to put on a CV.  Charity shops usually need people sorting through and pricing donations out back, which is something you could just stick some headphones in and get on with.

Look into therapy as well, there's probably gonna be a a bit of a wait but you'll benefit from it."
Alidl bit of both.
I'm 33 and still looking for the answer to this question
It’s a thankfully rare invasion of privacy that we shouldn’t be encouraging.
"Bullying in the workplace is quite common here.Also, everyone constantly asking me if I want tea. The best part is more vacation days."
The only plant that can get a mortgage offer retracted because a *neighbour* has it.
Lidl is life
And now *I'm* having to fight the urge to bully you.
"Compared to the antipodes:  

Best - social culture.  Every day someone is up for going to the pub!  Back home it’s Fridays only.  Also not the presenteeism you get in Oz - no one blinks an eyelid if I don’t get in till 9.30 because I was dropping the kids at school.  In Oz if you’re not at your desk at 8am it is noted.

Also the latitude you are afforded as a colonial is magnificent- I get away with all sorts of egregious stuff that would never fly if a local said/did it.

Worst - obv the SAD you get esp in Nov when the clocks go back.  Those couple of months when you don’t see daylight at your house are a bit grim."
"When it gets to autumn, apply to Royal Mail be a Christmas casual at a mail centre.  They take on all the people no-one else will eg. the men who were builders for the last 40 years, the housewives who haven't worked for a decade, the and people like yourself who haven't had a job before.

What they call an interview doesn't involve any actual interviewing, it's basically someone checking your face against your photo ID and then you fill out a bank details form and sign your contract.

Once you've had your training (which is basically: ""1st class in this trolley, 2nd class in this trolley, off you go"") there's very little human interaction required and you can just crack on with your work.

I was a Christmas casual once and ended up staying for 3 years."
I’d run for the hills if I were either of them
Worked for energy supplier - the above is correct!
"Wow, don't admit to that on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

The Pineapple Police will come after you"
"Probably the Molineux Stadium, season ends next week though"
I am seriously thinking of applying for them to be kicked out of the Commonwealth.
"Oh fuck no. Not unless I hated everyone in that entire side of town, everyone who would ever move into that area and all those farming the surrounding countryside too.

If you hate them, just hide a sack of prawns somewhere in the house or something."
You'd have hated it in the police.  We had cake fines.  Birthday?  That's cake.  Promoted?  Cake.  Demoted?  Cake.  Crashed a car?  Cake.  Let someone get away?  Cake.  Leave your computer unlocked?  Cake.  Etc etc etc.
Having spent 5 years getting rid of knotweed from my garden the only bit of the law that would matter is the sentence for murder if I caught someone doing it.
Poppies? I've got loads growing in my garden.
I'm going to go with acetone.
🚨🚨 **STOP RIGHT THERE** 🚨🚨
"I love some good fresh tomato after coming home from a hard day at the office, really helps me relax"
"Just because it's more the norm, doesn't mean it's not far. I have about a 15 minute commute and I can't tell you what wonders it does for my mental health."
"As this is ask uk, I recommend malt vinegar, bicarb of soda and a brillo pad.  I saw kim and aggie fix one."
"Also this. The correct response to finding out it was free is ""great, now let me look after you while it does its job""."
"I think Bill Bryson established that a ""sideboard"" was just that, a board at the side of a room. Much like a 'cupboard' was a board on which cups were placed.    
So I think the 'side' stems from putting stuff on a board at the side of the room."
OP could you please mark the post NSFW. My boss just called me in after a colleague saw the word p\*\*\*a\*\*le over my shoulder.
"The fact that society has always pushed men to ""be strong"" ""man up"" and effectively suppress feeling and emotion in order to maintain the status of ""Man""  
In comparison there is also a lot less support groups for men when it comes to certain issues. Many men for example are victims of domestic abuse but this isn't something that's considered anywhere near as seriously as women victims.  
Obviously these things are changing as society evolves but it's still lagging behind for men"
"Wow, roll on indyref2."
None of your fucking business.
This literally the next crisis of everyone in the UK in 25-30 years that is not being discussed at all.
I stay. But then I'm not going to get fired for taking a two hour lunch.
I would pass a drug test but a random drug test would cause me to rethink where I work. IMO if my boss is happy with the work I do and has had no complaints about the way I work then they have no reason to even think about whether I'm clean. If they don't trust that I'm clean then that's a conversation I expect boss to have first instead of a random drugs test.
The only reason I know about a US biscuit is because I use reddit.
