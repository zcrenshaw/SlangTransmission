"I moved to the UK last November from a small town on the Oklahoma/Texas border. The biggest difference is population density. Everyone is sort of crammed together outside of rural areas. People walk places or take public transportation, and that’s not even an option where I’m from. You have to drive everywhere. Sunday shopping hours, I can’t believe big grocery stores close at 4. Pub culture. Fewer churches (I’m from the Bible Belt, my hometown has more churches than I can count).  Very few drive-thrus here, comparatively. Better dairy and bread, fewer preservatives in food here. More attention is paid to preserving our environment here. People recycle and restaurants use paper straws and we bring our own bags to shop here. Gambling is legal nationwide here, it’s weird that you can just gamble on a phone app or at services. (Not in a bad way, just different) The roads and parking spaces are very narrow here. Oh, also, everyone seems to talk shit about whatever town they live in (unless it’s London).  Hometown pride is more prevalent in the US, even if the hometown is actually shitty. I love it here and don’t plan on going back."

"Answer hasn't changed since [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/9ns4mg/why_is_british_food_stereotyped_as_bad/)

tl;dr post-war stereotypes (when it was bad, mostly due to shortages and rationing), prior to the real boom in anglo-hybrid food (e.g. mainstreaming of good curry, influx of asian food, etc).  Lack of right demographic of immigrant Brits starting up restaurants in other countries to introduce people to good British food.  Tourists eating in tourist trap restaurants and deciding that is representative.  Cultural differences in what is considered good, esp. w.r.t. texture and 'stodgy' food which is ace in the winter and feels heavy to a lot of other cultures.

"Manager in a picking department at a factory. Look after 19 people and I really enjoy it.

Targets were constantly never reached before I started but that was due to the previous manager treating the force like crap.

They were on 7.50 an hour, room was extremely hot, closest water fountain was a good 5 minutes away resulting in only being able to go ar break as he would constantly monitor where they are while he sat down on his computer acting busy from what I've been told.

I started and put the entire team I had on to 9.50 an hour as the company has more than enough to do that, had water fountains installed in our department as well as vending machines. I also do picking as well as computer work takes an hour to do not the whole shift. Got a fan installed to make things easier as well as providing my team a fridge as there was none so they were stuck with warm food at break

Now they hit their targets and way past even though I don't try to make them focus on it and everyone seems much more happy and I'm actually enjoying working now after just being a part time worker at subway 2 months ago, a lot happened.

I attempted things in my life recently such as acting in a small role, learning to code, etc but i think this path is one I am starting to enjoy"

"Because we had such a long history, I am afraid we tend to be extremely blase and indifferent about producing so many great people.

Insofar as we feel national pride (which is something we argue about), I would say we feel it in a diffuse and undefined way rather than tying it to concrete persons, eras or historical achievements. It may indeed be that lots of other countries feel a similar sense of pride."
"Three people, though only one friend. Claire Richards from Steps was the year above but we shared a stage briefly in a school production. A guy called Rajko Radovic who was far too cool for my circle but was super nice so hard to hate him, went on to be an author and fitness guru.

The one I am actually proud to know is a lady called [Felicity Aston](http://www.felicityaston.co.uk/) who is a polar explorer, first woman to ski solo across Antartica. She is also an author and appeared on a BBC series about the atmosphere (the one with the airship). We climbed together at university and are still in touch. Strangest thing was when I went to the O2 in London to climb over the top of it. In the changing rooms there are murals of famous explorer such as Uri Gagarin, Vasco da Gama... and Felicity Aston. First reaction was what on earth was she doing as a huge mural on the wall. Second reaction was to take a picture and send it to her, she didn't even know it was there. She is a wonderful person and is doing a lot to take women from more oppressive cultures around the world on mad adventures."

"&gt; If I'm in the UK (or anywhere else) I ask the locals where to get proper food, and what dish would be recommended.

I always think this is terrible advice for tourists - most of the time in the UK you'll get sent to Nandos or Wetherspoons; lots of people don't eat out well in their home towns.  I'll look out local *foodie* advice, sure, but I wouldn't trust a random just because they're local (I mean, the tripadvisor top restaurants in my home town are... not the best places - I haven't even heard of about 3 or 4 in the top 10!)"

Even weird things like the main character is Indian, but they keep talking about his childhood in rural Ireland. And his sister isn't Indian. But they both have American accents. Their parents are white and have thick Irish accents. I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND.

"I wouldn't see the point, I like to drink to enjoy it or relax, so necking a pint in the middle of the day before rushing back to my desk sounds like the opposite of what I want.

"Came from France and even if it's literally next door there are still quite hudge differences :

- Less paperwork, it's a real burden in France. In the UK, almost everything is straightforward as long as you have a NIN and a proof or your address.

- The food in restaurants here is well presented, almost everything that is not fast food looks fancy but is worse taste-wise. I feel it a bit harder to find really good products in supermarkets - you need to know where to look for specific products.

- The salaries, taxes and work environment are WAY better here. French labour laws are really restrictive and annoying.

- Credit scores and credit reports. This doesn't exist in France - you need a lot of papers to prove your situation before you can apply to any credit. But if you default it causes less issues. It took me a while to get my head around it and build correct credit.

- The Brits seem less friendly than the French. I feel like friends here are either real friends or plain strangers compared to France where you might have a lot of acquaintances.

- People always talk shit about their hometown. I can't understand that. I thought complaining was a French thing.

That said, I am feeling more at home in the UK than in my home country. I am not planning to go back at all."

Who?
"* Big houses (that people live in actual houses, some of them detached, with gardens etc. even in London was really shocking. In my home country everyone lives in apartments blocks apart from smaller towns. If you live in the capital and you're rich, you get a nice central flat, but that's about it, family houses don't exist as an option.
* Also he fact Brits are totally oblivious of that and are actually convinced their houses are small (mostly comparing their properties to houses in rural US).
* Local culture and social activism. The number of various theatre groups, clubs, choirs, volunteer structures that are not managed centrally and represent their local area is mind boggling. Many other countries are a cultural desert in comparison. 
* Equality.  British society is one of the least equal in Europe, but still the pay gap between, say, bus drivers and software developers is much smaller that you would expect basing on the experience of my home country. Also that public sector jobs are paid relatively well (again, I know many people would find it strange, but in more countries than you think being a doctor in a state hospital means you have to take bribes).
* The fact that whether you have inherited a property (or bought it earlier) says more about your financial situation and what you can afford than your income.
* Police looking more like real relatable people. Perhaps due to the fact male officers are allowed to have facial hair and different haircuts, and there are more women in the force as well.
* People who do sports seriously. At least in London, I've met randomly more ultra-marathon runners, sport sailors, body builders, martial artists etc. than in all my previous life, and I am an office worker mostly meeting other office workers.
* More people who don't go to uni, and most of those who go, doing just a Bcs. In my home country it's 5 years at least that you're supposed to spend in the university or college.
*  Good weather. You can get through winter without a proper coat in most of the UK, and very few people have air conditioning for summer. Global warming is changing that, but it's still pretty enjoyable."

Also, the Gov.uk is website a masterpiece of design and useability. The fact that you can find anything from MOT test results to laws on there is great.

"&gt; Tourists eating in tourist trap restaurants and deciding that is representative.

I think that is a common mistake in many countries. Here in Germany, tourists seem to expect Bavarian Oktoberfest food even in spring and when they are a thousand kilometers from Bavaria.

If I'm in the UK (or anywhere else) I ask the locals where to get proper food, and what dish would be recommended.

I'm going to share a story I've only ever told to my closest friend because I'm so ashamed of how I behaved. Feel free to hate me for this, I hate myself for it but I was young (around 21) and stupid and I regret it to this day (over a decade later).

I was driving in the city centre during rush hour where two lanes merged to one where we had to cut across oncoming traffic. The guy behind me should have merged behind me but he sped up and cut me off leaving me in the way of oncoming traffic once the lights changed. I noticed he was wearing a kippah (Jewish headwear) and even though I have no ill feelings towards anyone based on their religion I yelled ""You stupid Jewish cunt"".

As I pulled along side him to get out of the way of oncoming cars I saw his car windows were open and his daughter, probably aged around ten, was also in the car. She would have heard what I shouted.

It still bothers me to this day that he probably just made a mistake cutting me up, but probably had to later explain to his daughter ""some people are just mean people, don't you let that man upset you.""

No one ever sees themselves as the villain but on that day I was the worst."

"Absolutely. Britain is not unique in its ability to produce influential figures. It's practically a standard that during a period of great wealth and power, a country will churn out great people. That applies to Britain, but it also applies to France, Germany, China, Egypt, Greece, and so on.

If anything, the number of influential people coming out of Britain today is much more impressive than the number we were producing during the high point of our power. Because today Britain doesn't have that same hegemony, but it still manages to put out an astonishing number of globally significant figures - even more than France and Germany, despite those two countries being just as wealthy, if not more."

I've found that food here at grocery stores is cheaper than back home in most regards, and there is both a lot of variety and yet less variety than back home if that makes sense. However, eating at a sit down restaurant is more expensive here than back home I've found. I live in Wales and I really enjoy the Welsh pride and how people have been incredibly welcoming towards me, always asking about where I'm from and talking about my experiences here. Lots of people have told me they love my accent! I do miss driving since I don't feel comfortable doing it here (opposite side, narrower roads, and I don't drive standard) but public transit is better here than at home. I think I like things here more than I dislike things, which is nice, and I'd like to stay."

1. Very, very few people look happy - especially at slot machines. And slot machines are the most effective way of vacuuming money out of your pocket. 

2. Over the long term, only the casino wins

3. In Macau, casinos have “private tables” for hire, where outside operators can run games. They are all run by Organised Crime as a way of laundering money. 

Casinos are... bad. Bad for the people who keep the casinos in business, bad for the local area, and good for Criminals.

-	I find British people friendlier overall but also have a harder time knowing whether they mean what they say or not.

-	Compared to privacy conscious German, people here don’t seem to mind being watched at all.

-	I eat out a lot and am very picky. I have found terrible but also tasty food in all countries I have lived in. I don’t find the UK better or worse. Most pubs and restaurants have terrible food but that’s not à British thing. I do find British bread hard to get used to though.

-	I like that people here don’t seem to care about where I come from but also find it frustrating. My non EU wife finds British people to be the least racist overall but I find that people lack a desire to learn about other cultures.

-	I find seeing a GP frustrating but found hospital services top notch. NHS is also cheaper than French and German healthcare.

-	The state of UK politics confuses me. It seems like everyone hates the tories, yet they stay in power. I’m also surprised there are so few demonstrations. People don’t seem to want to fight for what they believe in.

Overall, despite a rocky start, I find the UK to be a pretty good country and honestly think many Britons are being too harsh towards their country."
