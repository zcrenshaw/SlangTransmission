"It's all about the varieties they choose, the suppliers, warehousing and distribution. 

I used to work on a strawberry farm in the summer when at uni. They grew 3 types for different retailers. One looked like the perfect strawberry and was very hardy (didn't bruise or go mouldy easily, etc) but had hardly any flavour. They went to a national supermarket chain. We picked them just before they were ripe and they were instantly refrigerated, so they'd last longer for the supermarket. But the natural sugars didn't develop and the variety had hardly any flavour in the 1st place.

We did another variety with more flavour for a high end supermarket. They got damaged more often and we left them to ripen longer, so there was a lot more waste. That's why you pay a higher price, to cover waste but you get better quality and flavour.

The third ones were really ugly looking things that we picked totally ripe and tasted amazing. We sold them the day after they were picked to local market traders. Do you have a local market?

The ones I've grown myself have tasted better than any I've bought. The variety is important though and they like a lot of water. Pick them when they're 90% ripe and eat them the day after once the sugars have developed even more (if the birds don't get them first!)"

"one, the conflict was ideological not economic

two, there is a history of exceptionally shitty treatment towards miners from the government

three (and massively important), there was no real help from the government in recovering the loss of the primary industry in mining areas, no worthwhile retraining initiatives, no investment in other industries, just all the jobs (and not just in the mines, all the other jobs around it too) gone with nothing to replace them"

"Firstly, congratulations on the new wean.

Mental health conditions are covered under the Equality Act as a disability *(EDIT: if it's a condition that has lasted or is likely to last over 12 months!)* , and so he will likely be protected under this - any dismissal based on this would be illegal but only if they are aware of his disability - so it's in his best interest for them to be aware.

Under EA2010 the employer should make reasonable adjustments and risk assess his workload and how his mental health may impact it. Don't be surprised if they aren't really sure how to do this - mental health risk assessments and the like are still quite new for a lot of employers. Once he's in a better way, get him to engage in that fully and openly. There should be no stigma.

If he is in a union (which if he works for the council I would imagine he is), ask to speak to the branch secretary or convenor to make them aware of the situation and get him support when he returns to work. It's likely that reps will have dealt with this sort of thing in the past, or if not it will be in the best interest of their members AND the employer to know how to deal with supporting unwell members back into work.

Hope that helps!"

It's kind of like if you combined art attack, springwatch, and blue peter... then toned it all down to make it as boring as possible, and made the presenter an incredibly monotonous, softly spoken old man who smiles a lot. It was honestly one of the most uninteresting childrens shows I have ever watched. I was blessed with such wondrous activities as 'Mr Rogers goes to the shop and looks at some bananas', and 'Mr Rogers very slowly feeds some fish' and 'Mr Rogers plays with puppets in silence'. I thought I was being conned at points. Like this is all an inside joke because the show is just so bad that people ironically pretend they love it. "

Pension age was originally meant to be pretty close to life expectancy. 
"There is a reason for this - unlike in the US where stand-up comedy is just one step lower than Televangelism in terms of earning power, doing stand-up comedy in the UK isn't a particularly lucrative, so a lot of UK comedians have secondary (or primary) jobs in call centres.

"Medical studies have shown that it doesn't work and have linked it to psychological and behavioural problems later in life (I'd provide sources but I'm on mobile atm). On that basis alone I think it should be illegal. But even without that I'd still be against it. Children shouldn't fear their parents. You can still instill respect in children without hitting them.  

I find it very interesting that one of the last groups we've decided it is ok to punish physically is children. If my wife did something which angered me people would be appalled (and rightly so, of course) if I smacked her. I'd say most people would be against hitting a dog that misbehaved. But if your child plays up it's still broadly socially acceptable to smack them. I really don't get it."

"I am inclined to think it was more HOW she did it, than the fact she did do it.

As others have said, there was an ideological point to what she did. In saying 'there is no such thing as society' she was promoting a certain vision of the direction Britain should go. 

At the time (I was student age), my contemporaries and I tended to object more to the anti-communitarian thinking than to the need for a new economic reality.

Personally, I do think that if Thatcher had not done what she did, the next government would have had to. The UK was the First Industrial Nation and it was inevitable that all the old infrastructure etc would run into problems.

Personally, I think that globalisation was and is basically the driver of most UK government action from post-WW2. Though things have always been expressed in terms of ideology, ideology came second to necessity.

However, Thatcher did what she did in a divisive way. Those who suffered individually as a result of these structural changes were bound to hate her.

Also- it was a long time ago. There was no Internet and not even mobile phones. The sense in which Thatcher embodied 'capital' and the miners (etc) 'labour' and the sense in which privatising state assets was a moral stance were much starker and simpler than things look like nowadays. "
"As others have said, the primary driver wasn't to do with the economics of coal mining. She had three interconnected motivations:

1. Ideology. The Conservative Party then, as now, believed that nationalisation was a form of socialism. When Margaret Thatcher came to power vast swathes of British industry, from coal mines to steelmaking to bookmakers to travel agents were run by the state, and she embarked on a wholesale privatisation campaign. The coal mines were one of the largest nationalised industry, but she knew she couldn't privatise them because of reason 2:

2. Unions. During the 1970s the trade union movement had grown in both membership and power, to the extent that at times they were able to make governments jump to their tune. Mrs Thatcher had been elected on a pledge to severely limit the power of the unions, and to do that she needed to take on and win against not a small insignificant union,  but one of the largest and most militant. There were several fights she could have picked in that regard, but she chose the miners, probably due to reason 3:

3. Cold, unabashed revenge. The miners unions had given Ted Heath's government two bloody noses in what was then recent memory: the first in 1972 when flying pickets from the NUM went to power stations and railways and effectively shut down the entire country. A state of emergency was declared, the government invented COBRA (still in use today) and basically had to give in to the miners' demands. Then just 2 years later another miners strike had even more severe implications, with the country going on to a three-day week to ration electricity. Ted Heath called an early general election with the slogan ""Who governs Britain?"" and the electorate returned a hung Parliament -- effectively answering his question by saying ""We don't know, but it doesn't seem to be you"". Thatcher, like most Conservative MPs of the time, never forgave Arthur Scargill for bringing down a Conservative government and 1984 was her opportunity to turn the tables."
"Legally no, not if you agreed to do it.

"Someone took a couple of unprovoked swings at a friend because he was a little bit drunk and loud on a bus, he retaliated in defence. The driver stopped the bus, called the police. The person who instigated the situation claimed he was mentally unwell &amp; released without charge. My friend accepted a 6 year caution for common assault. He gave no provocation and did not throw the first punch, in fact he stood and took a number of blows before dealing out a single retaliative shot, yet he ended up worse off.

He's tried to get into the armed forces and been declined on the basis of that caution. 

When I was doing a Door Supervision course a few years ago, the instructor practically started by telling us he was also a magistrate. He also said never, under any circumstances, accept a police caution - as you are practically admitting guilt. His stance is that you are better to fight it. However that's a polarising opinion."

"Two good reasons, but ones that are not helpful to you, both of which save money.

"I withheld rent on a house share after I/we had complained for months. My tipping point came when i and my two house mates were without heating/hot water from 18 December - 4 January. Not the warmest months in the UK. Showering in freezing water. We all got sick. We couldn’t live decently. And every day the frustration mounted. The anger swelled. The emails and texts became for vicious.  

We actually lost the case against the landlord because it is illegal to withhold rent for any reason whatsoever. After the litigation, and an arbitration process that followed, I had to pay the rent we withheld. 

He was however forced to correct everything in the house. Not just the boiler. And this came at considerable cost to him. 

TL:DR - don’t withhold rent before getting legal backing and guidance to do so. 

But yes, definitely help them out "

"Because they were the poorest in Europe they got regional funding from the EU - funding now we are leaving is likely to not go back to funding the deprived areas in Wales and Cornwall.  

Both those areas voted to leave the EU, which is something almost quite maddening as you just had to look around and see the large amount of things with EU funding.  Unlike the loss of mining as an industry, they dug themselves this hole."

"Some arse was dragging their dog round town at lunchtime today. It was 32 degrees. Poor thing kept trying to get in the shade and dickface kept pulling it along.

On the flip side, someone was walking her dog on the rec, a frizzy thing, and the pooch spent most of the time in the shade by the trees. She'd taken a bowl and a bottle of water with her.

So basically it's how you do it. Walk dog through hot town on red hot pavement and you're a cunt, take dog to warm rec with shade and water and you're probably ok, provided it's not too far to get there."

"If you were a dude this would actually be easier but as a woman there's a pretty decent size overlap. For me, I'd assume if an office said smart attire that it would be either a dark skirt with tights, or dark trousers, a light coloured blouse, and a dark coloured jacket. I would probably go for plain, or perhaps some stripes - but not floral, bright colours or patterns until I'd assessed the workplace. Flats or heels would be fine, I personally would not wear heels to work because I hate them (and am also already pretty tall). 

Basically I'd wear black or navy trousers, a white blouse and a black or navy smart jacket until I'd seen what other coworkers are wearing and take it from there, as it really is an awkward thing to define from one word and every office tends to vary."

"I refused to accept a Police caution after being stopped and searched at a music festival. I had nothing of note on me other than a can of cider (and I was over 18).

Additionally, think about when people justify smacking their kids with ""Well I was smacked as a kid and I turned out ok"". These people might be functional adults, but they're perfectly fine beating someone who has far less power and capacity to understand than them. Is that ok to you? "
