"A white Audi on finance parked outside a 4 bed new build that looks nice but has rooms smaller than shoeboxes and a garden the size of a leaf.

2 week all inclusive in Spain with your two kids and your friends and their two kids. Obligatory photos of ""little uns"" on the Thomas Cook plane watching Paw Patrol on their ipads. Dad and his mate Steve have a pint in the airport. Mum secretly hopes the waiter in the resort will finger her.

Dad plays golf when he can. Clubs in the back of the Audi, golf attire on. He doesn't know how to play, but the fact he's a member at the local club looks good. Even if it's not THE club, it's just as good. This one lets him take his mates.

He's a team leader at an insurance company, she works part time for a manufacturing company doing the accounts. She looks good, but you tell her best years are behind her. The living room is immaculate. Black and white portrait of the family all wearing white hangs over the fireplace. There's a silver ornament there too, it says ""Love"" she got it from Next in the sale."

"Keep going back. Keep following their advice (including taking ""ibu fucking profen"").

&amp;#x200B;

The repeated visits will build up a paper trail that shows there is a real, ongoing, problem and encourage them to try to solve it. Following their advice and reporting back that you have done so and its effect (or lack of) will show them you are willing to co-operate and encourage them to try other things and look into the problem further. Taking ibuprofen for a period is a reasonable diagnostic and treatment technique for what could be an inflammatory problem, if it has no effect that tells them something.

"There is a sign by an escalator:

""Dogs must be carried on the escalator"" (7 words) 

Easy, right? 

The meaning looks obvious, but what if it was a law? You could stand on the escalator and a cop might arrest you because you DON'T have a dog. His interpretation is that you must have a dog with you if you use the escalator.

Clearly this is stupid and not how the law was intended to be used, but technically the cop isn't wrong. So the sign gets changed:

""If you have a dog it must be carried on the escalator"" (12 words) 

You ride the escalator and get stopped by a cop again. He asks if you own a dog and you say yes, it's at home. So now the cop arrests you because you have a dog but didn't carry it on the escalator.

So the sign gets changed again:

""If you are currently responsible for a dog and you have the dog with you then the dog must be carried on the escalator"" (24 words) 

The next day you buy a dog plushie from the toy shop and ride the escalator...

""If you are currently responsible for a dog (actual living and non-plushie animal) and you have the dog with you then the dog must be carried on the escalator..."" (30 words) 

This is why laws are often so complicated and full of technical definitions, sections, sub sections etc. ."

"I'm more worried about our town centres, to be honest.  They're in a pretty bad way, and far too many towns think they can still treat parking like a luxury service that has a luxury price.  (Hint: Unless you're in a big city, no you can't.  Not if you still want to have any business left in five years time.)"

"Ooh I've got one. First year uni flat around 2013. Prison cell rooms, a slightly larger common space and a thin hallway for 5 dudes. Also worth noting that this was around the time the generic hipster trope of fixed gear bikes was becoming a thing. 

One guy, we'll call hipster Dave, found his dad's ancient fixie in his dad's shed so brought it to the flat and left it in the tiny hallway. I get called out my room and see something hanging off the underside of the seat. After conferring with the guys we realise it's a spiders nest. A fucking COLLOSAL spiders nest full of eggs and babies.

I'm an animal lover, but arachnophobic. Another flatmate, crazy Bob, was also arachnophobic but maybe acted on his impulses a little faster then the rest of us, so while me and three dudes are in the kitchen debating what to do we hear a sort of roaring noise from the hallway.

We go through to find Bob with a lighter and a can of deodarant torching the nest. Few stragglers running away and a fairly memorable popping noise which I believe was either eggs or clumps of superheated spidey bits exploding.

The smell hung about for a couple days but that aside it was actually a pretty elegant solution. I mean I'm not condoning the killing of them all but I was mad relieved when it'd been dealt with.

Lived with crazy Bob for the following 4 years. He's vegan now (lol)"
They've been around for at least 20 years and I've always assumed they exist to stop people doing lines in the loo.
"Rented a place in Zone 4. Wanted to get a phone line put in (yes, it was a long time ago), so called BT to arrange it. 

They said they had no record of our flat. Checked other places (council etc.) and found out why all bills were included. 

The house had been illegally divided into three flats, and the landlord hadn’t told anyone. 

So, a whole month after we had moved in, we got in contact with a Theatre Fire Officer (we both worked in the theatre) to inspect the flat. They wrote a report detailing every breach of fire regulations. 

We went to the landlord, and said that if they didn’t release us from our contract and return our deposit we would post the report to the council. 

They obviously did release us early and returned our deposit. 

We then posted the report anyway."

"You're probably not going to like this answer, but here it is anyway.

Flats are noisy.  The ceiling void between your flat and your upstairs neighbour basically acts like an acoustic chamber and amplifies noise.  I know this because I lived in a flat for 10 years and had the same problem.  The difference is, I'd been in my neighbours flat while everyone was just moving around normally, then come downstairs to my partner asking what the hell had happened because it sounded like there was a wrestling match going on.  It was particularly bad because they had concrete floors, so there was no noise dampening; laminate can cause the same effect - I know this because we had it laid in our hallway, and our downstairs neighbour immediately started complaining about the increase in noise.

I hate to say it, but if noise is this much of an issue for you living in a flat is probably not a good idea, unless it's a top floor flat."

You have to realise that above all else, the NHS is a triage machine. It's about taking very discreet, escalating treatment steps. You weren't completely blown off, you were told to take ibu fucking profen as a first step. If the ibu fucking profen doesn't work, go back to the doc and tell him that. You'll be bumped up to something stronger (trama fucking dol?) *or* referred to a specialist at that point. Then you'll go through the same with the specialist.

"There is no difference in quality. The issue foreigners struggle with is that they don't understand that a lot of uniquely British food is borrowed from other nations, and that these borrowings have developed over time to create something that's unique. 

Like British curry is arguably our national cuisine, and it doesn't actually exist anywhere else in the same way it does here, with a lot of dishes being invented here. So foreigners assume that the unique parts of our cuisine aren't 'ours' and try to strip it back to 'lamb and potaters is boring ha ha', which is just misrepresenting the situation."

"I haven't seen a single comment that describes upper class yet. It's perfectly possible to be really well off and still middle class. To be properly upper class is something you're born into you can't just become by having loads of money. 

Middle class is almost defined by a fear of losing wealth or status that's simply not present in the upper class. The upper class are confident their position in society is fixed, which brings an air of confidence not present in the middle classes. Whereas the working class have very little wealth or status to lose which means they are able to share many traits with the upper class. They can be confident as they don't have any status to lose.

There's also the fact the middle class has grown considerably and there's quite big difference between the upper middle class and and lower middle class. The working class has also shrunk making it harder to define society in the traditional classes."

4. You alright? is how you say hello, it is not a concerned question.

5. Fancy dress is a costume, not a nice outfit.

6. You have to ask for the bill, it does not come to you unprompted, ever.

7. Don't make eye contact or smile at strangers unless you want enemies.

8. You have to make reservations pretty much everywhere halfway decent, well in advance.

9. Always carry a reusable bag with you, you have to pay for bags everywhere you go. Some places don't even have them at all. That's fun when it's raining and you buy a bunch of things.
