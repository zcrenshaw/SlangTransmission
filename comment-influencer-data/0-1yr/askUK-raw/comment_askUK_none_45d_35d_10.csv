"Yep. My anxiety can literally make me even more anxious. I have good coping/relaxing methods now but I think you’re right. People are just being more open about discussing it and it’s about time. The brain is an organ like any other and it can become unwell or function a little strangely sometimes. People wouldn’t tell someone with kidney failure ‘oh it’s nothing, you’re fine’ so why do we do that with arguably the most important organ in our body?"
"I think it was, and certainly, the pint is for pubs but the places were putting stickers over the corners so they introduced the numbers."
Yes. American beer used to have a terrible reputation in the UK ‘why is American beer like sex in canoe? Coz it’s fucking close to water etc’ but American craft beer has found its way over here now and is now broadly well thought of. American brewing styles have certainly influenced the current raft of British craft beers. Personally I think we are living in a golden age of craft beer and American micro breweries have certainly been a big contributor to this.
The monarchy has no real impact unless there’s a jubilee or wedding or something that gives us an excuse to get bladdered.
"Aye. Most people that support it would just prefer it and don’t actively push for it. The Royals are pretty much just hereditary celebrities, so no one really gives a fuck."

"Totally agree with you. The bulk of ""real ale"" you you get in most pubs is bland and flavourless. There are some great ones out there, but more regional so it depends where you live. I live in a town with two CAMRA award winning pubs who do offer some good beers, however I would love a decent craft bar.

It is easy to dismiss craft beer as overly hoppy IPAs and that is a problem, but tends to be from faux craft brewers that are owned by macro breweries who stick a trendy label on it and sell to supermarkets.

Which isn't to say you can't get good stuff in Supermarkets, the guy who buys for Tesco just put out there autumn range and there are some interesting beers in there.

Craft beer is more than a can of Brewdog Punk, which I am sure is most folks idea of a craft beer. 

I am very much a fan of craft and whilst it is nice to have the occasional bitter or mild, there is no flavour when compared to a really juicy NEIPA or smoked gose."

"Oh yeah I can echo that sentiment. I wouldn't class myself as techy at all but I am useful nonetheless. However, our contract is enormous in terms of size and importance and the role we play is vital to the running of it. The lack of basic knowledge is astounding. I very quickly learned contracts in IT are essentially teams of 40 people being held together by 5"

"The helpline will likely reopen tomorrow at which point they can advise you on what to do. I would suggest doing nothing tonight and then following their advice tomorrow. It's speculation on my part, but if you communicate with them tomorrow before the deadline, then they are likely to give you the time needed to sort the missing paperwork if required."
"See, what you're describing there is an unmanaged disorder, and a managed disorder. It's still a disorder. Whether it's being treated pharmaceutically or psychologically, it's still being managed. As such, there's not really a line to be drawn there.

I believe the consensus for line-drawing is ""when untreated, it meaningfully negatively impacts behaviors that would otherwise be unimpacted"", or something to that effect. 

To wit, people put off dentist visits because visiting dentists is uncomfortable at best. This is not a disorder, people don't like having fingers shoved in their mouths. However, a person putting off eating to avoid doing unnecessary damage to their teeth, so they can put off dentist appointments, would be. 

Similarly, and more personally, vomiting is unpleasant. No one wants to, even if it can feel better after it's all done. However, due to a bad experience with food poisoning and subsequent bullying in primary school, I now risk panic attacks if I eat proper sit-down meals at a table with others or in public. That anxiety has been made to transcend what is considered normal baseline behaviour, and become a disorder."

"I thought the same way. I mean I got two degrees, presented in front of directors, flown around Europe to the bumfuck middle of no where to run large scale plant trials that could cost £10000’s if I fucked up, jumped out of aeroplanes, performed in front of hundreds of people. I always got that ‘butterfly’ feeling, but it was the *good* kind of butterfly feeling you know? The stuff that gets you pumped up ready to go. But the thing is I was living this fast paced high stress lifestyle to avoid issues I didn’t want to deal with. Like my first cat getting hit and killed by a car. My partner being diagnosed with a life long disability. My family being, well... a massive dysfunctional mess. All above the bubbling thoughts of ‘I don’t belong here, I’m not good enough, I’m just pretending and they’ll find out I’m a fraud’. I always used to just *suck it up*. I was the one that would just get shit done.

Earlier this year my brain went ‘no more, I’m not going to let you avoid all this shit. **Enough**’. I started having severe panic attacks and the worst thing was I didn’t know what they were at the time. Felt like I was dying. I’ve ended up in A&amp;E (doctors advice was to go to A&amp;E if my heart rate wasn’t dropping back to normal after 30 mins), had ECG’s, called the paramedics, had emergency doctors appointments. Eventually we found out that it was anxiety. Luckily I’m not too proud to shrug off my doctors advice when she said ‘ I strongly recommend you see a therapist’. I’m doing much better now but I still get moments, completely outta no where where I just can’t function. They’re much rarer since I know the warning signs now but it’s no joke. 

Maybe a few are ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ but believe me if someone says to me now ‘I can’t do that it’s making me really anxious’ I damn well listen. Cos’ I know the signs, I know even the toughest of people can be reduced to a trembling mess because their brain has gone ‘eh fuck this’ and I know how fucking awful it is.

"I'd argue ther Crown Estate isn't really their property, as it's the property of the Crown. So it only belongs to the Queen in her capacity as monarch. If there is no monarch any more, who's to say it should revert to the ownership of the last person to hold that position? I'd argue the state would be justified in keeping it.

But the Royal Family also owns a lot private property. They would keep that."

Court and fines are a last resort for willful refusal to register after many attempts by the council to get you to do so.  Call the electoral registration people tomorrow and you’ll probably find them to be the most helpful local government employees you’ll ever encounter.
"Definitely. I come from a country where that happens as well, but people can't be open about it - so they either isolate themselves, or get ostracized and mocked.

I'm still new in the UK but I see there is a big amount of mental health issues going around and it breaks my heart. But it also seems like a country where those issues are better identified and everyone is better aware of them, and like people can feel more open about actually recognizing their issue, and even getting help and good attention from other people.

I suffer from some degree of social anxiety, and I feel much more comfortable making jokes about it here in comparison to my home country. And if may, I actually think the best part of having social anxiety is finding other people that also recognize their part and say ""oh, me too, funny right?"" and you can joke around and share your part."

"It won't cost you more.

One benefit of a smart meter is that it sends the readings directly to your energy supplier. So your bills are always accurate, never based on estimates, and you don't have to remember to read the meter yourself and send the readings in.

Having said that, some sorts of energy accounts try to smooth out your payments over the year. In the summer you pay more than the cost of the energy you've actually used, and in the winter you pay less than the cost of the energy you've actually used.  If the supplier's formula for calculating how much to charge you each month is off, you could be over-paying (until you or they notice, and it adjusts). But with a smart meter, the calculation will be based on actual consumption, rather than estimated consumption, so they should be better or at least no worse.

Another benefit of a smart meter is that some suppliers allow you access to the detailed consumption data so that you can see graphs of energy usage throughout the day, throughout the week etc.  If you're numerically minded, that can help you understand how you're using energy and maybe cut down.  For example, we discovered how much we were spending on heating the house when we're not home, and that gave us the justification for getting smarter heating controls.

In the longer term, a smart meter will allow to choose energy tariffs where the cost varies throughout the day. In order to smooth out peaks of demand, energy companies will start offering tariffs where energy is much cheaper at certain hours. If you have an electric car, for example, the car charger can talk to the smart meter and make sure it only charges the car when electricity is cheap, that sort of thing.  But it's a way off yet."

"&gt;Absolutely! When I was in London I thought there was a problem with my shampoo 'cos it wouldn't lather properly, turns out it was just the effect of the weird hard water.

Strangely, I'm the opposite.

"Speed limits exist because people are dopey fuckers and can't be trusted.

80mph means your car has ~30% more kinetic energy than a car travelling at 70mph even though you're only going ~14% faster.

Doesn't mean it's alright though does it?"
"&gt; then you might need a new smart meter every time.

that was only the first gen. The current gen are transferable."
"&gt;Also if you are in the habit of switching supplier often then you might need a new smart meter every time

It is a shame that the government rushed into the SMETS1 implementation that caused that issue, there are some SMETS2 meters about but I don't know which suppliers are installing them and I would want confirmation it would be a SMETS2 meter before having one put in."

"I’m 31 and have no idea what to do either so I can’t help much! But I will say: a lot of jobs out there aren’t the sort of jobs you dreamed of having, but they are satisfying and allow you to do the stuff you want. Think of a typical company: it might have an HR dept, IT, marketing, purchasing, finance. If you had to work for one of those, which dept would you pick? You could get an entry level job in that until you have things a bit more figured out, meanwhile you are building experience if you want to stay. 

As for earning a necessary amount for a family, that can be pretty fluid. Kids can cost a lot less than we think (houses can’t though sorry). Your partner might bring some income to the table though, perhaps your parents will help too, so you aren’t on your own with that. 

Start saving straight away, if at all possible, put by as much as you can manage and by the time you are 30 or so (a likely age for wanting to dip in) you will hopefully have a decent little nest egg to start with. 

But, having said the above, you definitely have time for a gap year. I wish I had done that, they are incredibly valuable, and well worth the years delay."

The only issue is that sometimes they don’t communicate properly or don’t get set up properly - if this happens to you, get onto your supplier asap to ensure you don’t build up any debt."

"The issue with the old smart meters is that if you changes suppliers, they became ""dumb"" meters again. The new generation of meters don't have this issue. 

Personally, and at the risk of being accused of having a tinfoil hat, I'm staying away from smart meters for the time being. I don't think that smart meters provide enough benefit for me as a consumer to trade-off the amount of data and power that they give the energy suppliers. 

Providing my meter readings every month is not that much of bind, I'm not bothered about having a £25 ""energy monitor"" in my house, but I am bothered about installing a piece of technology that would enable energy suppliers to introduce Uber-style 'surge price' tariffs that could result in my paying more due to using energy during 'peak' hours. I shouldn't have to pay more for a cup of tea just because I put the kettle on during the half-time of an England World Cup game, but a smart meter theoretically gives the energy supplier that power. 

Yes, I get that there are economy 7 tariffs and that sort of thing but I think that the level of data being generated by smart meters is a different level entirely. 

Long story short, smart meters have greater benefit to the energy suppliers than they do the consumer and, given the track record of the Big Six when it comes to customer care, I don't think I want to give them that benefit."

He also drives like a total bell end weaving traffic and cutting people off. He also never wears his seat belt and he doesn’t make his young kids wear theirs. He also reeks of weed every time I see him. Cunt. 

I don’t have an issue with loud sports cars and motorbikes usually. But adding a loud exhaust to a shitty car is just sad imo."
