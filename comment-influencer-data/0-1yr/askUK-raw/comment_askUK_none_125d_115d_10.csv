"American media is wrong. Nobody I know hates the NHS. We all agree it could be better but none of us would take the shit storm that is the American healthcare ""system"""
"British people complain about the NHS, not because they hate it, but because they love it and hate how it's being mismanaged.

But American media spins protests about it as protests *against* the NHS when they are actually protests *for* the NHS.

Waiting times can be long, but on the plus side you don't go bankrupt if you get ill. Or worse, die because you can't afford healthcare.

Practically no one would want a healthcare system like the US. That's a worst case scenario for most British people."
The NHS
"We hate the fact that our government underfunds and undervalues the NHS, and wants to sell the profitable bits to their mates.

We don't end up bankrupt for having a broken arm, or see horror stories like you get in the US where people just leave life-changing injuries untreated."

"The best tip I can give you: in the UK ""Derby"" rhymes with Barbie, not with Furby."
"It's safe.

The weather is mild. Not too hot, not too cold. No monsoon rains, no blizzards or big tornadoes.

The plants and animals are not out to kill you. We don't have any deadly spiders, snakes or scorpions. We don't have large mammals like polar bears or tigers. The seas are safe, with no crocodiles or man-eating sharks. (i'm aware that even in countries like Australia it's very unlikely to be killed by these animals).

We have good public healthcare systems, with decent infrastructure and legal systems. e.g. you have to pass a reasonably strict driving test (can't just pay a small bribe for it), and your car must be maintained and pass an annual inspection.

There is not a huge deal of crime. Sure, there are a few gang-related crimes mainly in major cities, but it's on a completely different scale to most other countries. We have strict gun laws to prevent mass shootings (Incidentally USA have celebrated their 150th mass shooting of 2019 today). I don't worry about getting gunned down in the street, or being kidnapped, mugged or raped.
If I leave my bag on a bus I can be fairly certain that the finder will hand it in, rather than nick anything valuable and shove it in a bin.

You only have to travel to a few other countries to realise quite how good we have it here. We live in a wealthy country with minimal visible corruption."

"Stick it all over social media, that's fucking outrageous."
"Either a funeral with a New Orleans matching band, or just drive on like nothing happened. There is no middle ground here."
"&gt;Some people said that the NHS has little to fear as any attempts to abolish it would be considered suicidal for any political party.

I don't think so. 

Any attempts to privatise and/or abolish the NHS wouldn't be done overnight. It would be a gradual process of defunding the system and slowly outsourcing more and more procedures to private hospitals. 

Much like what is happening now and nobody is losing their shit or protesting in the streets."
"Put a brick through your window and say it must be the same person who keyed your car. If she did key your car then you should be able to tell by her response, also she‚Äôll have to fix the window. Win win... also kinda a loss with a smashed bedroom window but ya know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

To be honest pretty much every chain restaurant, TGI Fridays, Frankie and Bennie's, Chiqitos has gone right down the shitter the past 2 or 3 years, Nandos is probably the only half decent place at an affordable price that is regularly available."
"The only reason it's a bit shit is because our Conservative government is starving it of funding so it fails and they can privatise it. 

We wouldn't ever swap to your system by choice.

Anyone that wants private cover can get it here for far less than it costs in the US. Your government also spends twice as much on free healthcare as ours does."
"If you happen to go into the gents' toilets in the High Wycombe Asda, avoid the cubicle nearest the sink: the lock's a bit dodgy and the flush doesn't work."

"It's illegal, Section 137 of the Highways Act, you can phone the police about it if they do it."
"We also complain about it because complaining is like an Olympic sport to us.

Not complaining in order to get something resolved, like bad service in a restaurant, you understand. No, that wouldn't do at all."
"Most started off as separate papers and got taken over in the course of time

Traditionally, people had more time to read newspapers on Sundays, while less political and business stuff is going on at weekends, and so Sunday papers are thicker and have more magazine content, plus analysis of what has happened in the week.

This is a legacy of pre-online days, really. Obviously updating a website is something very different."
"You know when you go down town with the lads and you all realize you‚Äôre hank marvin‚Äô so you say ‚Äúlads let‚Äôs go Maccers‚Äù but your mate Smithy a.k.a. The Bantersaurus Rex has some mula left on his nandos gift card and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúmate let‚Äôs a have a cheeky nandos on me‚Äù and you go ‚ÄúSmithy my son you‚Äôre an absolute ledge‚Äù so you go have an extra cheeky nandos with a side order of Top Quality Banter.

Or like when you're absolutely hanging from the night before after drinking 60 WKD blue because they were on special and then you wake up on your mates kitchen floor at 1pm cuddling a teapot with a proper gammy mouth and the only thing that is gonna fix it and your fuzzy head is a cheeky nandos chicken wing roulette plate with extra cheeky fizzy drink after ordering tap water."
"Well, I do at least. But I never knew it's origins so thank you, that's actually pretty interesting."
"Yes you can name them here.

Stand your ground. Sounds like bullying tactics. Could you go directly to your managers boss and tell them about the mistake?
"General UK things : 

Tipping isn‚Äôt really a thing here. If we decide to leave a tip, it‚Äôs mostly out of politeness. No one will care if you don‚Äôt tip. 

Halloween isn‚Äôt that big of a deal here, some people (students) will dressed up and get pissed. People with kiddies will go trick or treating but it‚Äôs much more understated and only a houses will do it. 

Thanksgiving isn‚Äôt a thing at all.

We will go nuts for Christmas though. Shops will get festive around late October/ early November. People will put up decorations at the start of December and leave them up until the first week of January.

If someone offers you a tea - it‚Äôs fine for you to ask for another drink. 

Our Mother‚Äôs Day (maybe Father‚Äôs Day as well?) is on a different day to yours. 

Find your nearest Aldi for your grocery shopping. 

DD/MM/YT never month first, that‚Äôs just crazy! 

Our plug sockets are different to yours so you‚Äôll get to get adapters for your techs devices. 

Mobile phone carries will be different too- try giffgaff for UK based stuff, they do a monthly sim bundle which means you won‚Äôt have to get a long contract.

If it‚Äôs nice hot weather during the summer then make the most of it and the early daylight in the mornings and into the evenings. Winter will be cold, dark and most likely wet. 

(Whispers...) Nando‚Äôs isn‚Äôt that good."
"&gt;American media is constantly shouting about how much British people hate their healthcare system.

That doesn't sound at all suspicious or utterly divorced from reality."
"Stewart Lee, though he's let himself go a bit."

Yes and you walk on the right side i.e. you can see cars coming at you.
"You're not being an arsehole. In fact, as you're on a new build estate it is likely that the restrictive covenants within the transfer deed to your property state that the visitor parking space can only be used for visitors (sometimes they even specify how long the visitor can park there).

The covenants are agreed by everyone that buys a house on a development to keep the peace and avoid issues like this.

However, enforcement is another issue. To enforce the restrictions most developers put a management company in place. They manage the communal areas and deal with breaches like this. You should check your documents, but it's likely you are a member of the management company. It'll be called something like ""development name management company limited"". As a member, you should also be notified of the name and contact details of the directors and secretaries of the company. There may also be information on residents meetings and such. This is where you would raise this type of issue.

A breach of something like this can be dealt with through the courts, but usually a scary letter will do the job (which would be done by the management company).

My property law knowledge is a little rusty but I dealt with new build developments for a while and we had this question a lot. I'd recommend first and foremost you check the transfer deed and then anything you have from the management company."

"Contact the area manager. Ask them nicely if they'll reconsider their decision to make you work a holiday. When they ask wtf you're on about, explain that the manager has told you that she is following the area managers instructions and explain the situation."
System is terrible when there isn't enough funding and resources. The vast majority of Britons regard the NHS as the greatest thing Britain has ever achieved. Also complaining is our national pastime.
"Have a look at what's happening in your local school. Academy? In a Trust with other academies? Well that's not privatisation is it? Hmn or is it. It's taking a few years and it's hard to put your finger on, but people are finding ways to profit from kid's education and no one protests in the streets about it and in a few years it'll be done. 

And that's how it'll be with the NHS too, tiny, completely reasonable baby steps and before we know what's happening it'll be too far to go back."
"Not London, Manchester or Birmingham."

"Slightly edited Copy and Paste from an old post of mine:

Without the NHS my son would be dead. He has a fairly complex heart conditon, and his issues are on the severe end. The main problem is that Pulmonary Artery didn't form properly and his Pulmonary Valve not at all.

The anomaly was noted at the 20 week scan, and from then on the care has been incredible. We were sent to a specialist, where two people conducted a 60 minute ultrasound and they gave us the full story. Either abort, or give birth and have open heart surgery straight - I felt, and still do, that they were open and upfront with the entire prognosis, odds and risks etc of the process.

On the basis of the likely hood of a good outcome we continued the pregnancy and gave birth at a local hospital, where the baby was placed immediately into intensive care. Almost precisely 24 hours later, at 11pm on a Friday night a specialist ambulance was dispatched to us that can carry a NICU child.

We got transferred to a specialist children's hospital, where at 12;00am the registrar admitted us and did her own 30-40minute ultrasound and got him settled in and on the right short term drugs.

On Monday the surgical team, doctors, specialist nurses met and debated the best course of action. We agreed to Open Heart Surgery to add an artificial conduit to bypass the crap bits and he was operated on the Tuesday morning. Surgery took about 4 hours and was, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst time of my life.

We got the call, met him in intensive care while he was still being attended to. I can't even count the people around him, it was like the TV. Doctors, nurses, surgeon's in a hubub of activity. Surgery went well, but he was still pretty poorly.

We stayed for a while, then went to shower and change as we hadn't all day. That's when my wife got our oh shit call - I walked into the room and she was white as a ghost. All she said is that we need to go, and we did.

By the time we were back in PICU the surgical team were already working on him right on the bed, and the liason team intercepted us - due to a small undetected bleed he'd suffered a sudden and serious amount of blood loss and a critical loss of blood pressure. This then became our second worst time of our lives - as they re entered his chest to fix it. It's the only time I've come close to literally fainting.

They sorted him out, and that proved to be the last major hurdle in his recovery. We were in for another few weeks, progressing out of ICU, back to HDU and finally home.

Then this year we did it all again! I could write all day about the whole experience, because there's just so much of it but suffice to say I'm happy with the NHS. It's not perfect, we haven't liked everyone we have met in the journey but one has to measure the system as a whole.

I've looked up the costs of this surgery in the USA and what people there are facing to go through it. I also follow some Global Facebook groups and Americans are constantly worrying about cost and insurance. I've never once seen a British heart parent worry about costs.

And the only forms I've ever signed are consent forms - nobody in that entire process cares about my job, what we earn or who we are.

 I have no qualms laughing in the face of anyone who doesn't think that their system is ludicrously broken."

The history, the adversity, the craftsmanship. 

I unfortunately can't pick out a single thing that makes the UK great, it's a combination of small things, even things that may not matter to most people."
"Declaration of interest: NHS clinician.

&gt; From what I gather from friends and family that work in the NHS it's just ran like shit. 

The two, however, go very much hand in hand. Statistically, the NHS as a whole is admirably efficient with the usage of its funding. There are many areas that could be improved, but that doesn't mean that overall, it ultimately does well with what it gets.

&amp;#x200B;

However, increasingly, as budgets are squeezed (not, I might add, purely from funding squeezes, but also the growing cost of advanced treatment, eg cancer drugs), you tend to decrease the quality of management and background staff. Take IT for example - salaries in the NHS for IT workers are far, *far* below the median salary in the private sector. As such, the NHS generally attracts more junior, less experienced and/or less skilled individuals. This in turn results in less efficient or capable IT systems, which nowadays form the backbone of frontline services, which in turns makes frontline work more difficult, which in turn lowers morale. And of course, lack of funding (comparitively to other nations with excellent service) means lack of staff. We've been pilfering nurses and doctors from all across the world, in large part because we happen to speak English, not because our pay or working conditions are better.  


There's also been an ongoing ""deprofessionalisation"" of clinicians and allied health professionals. The grumbles amongst front line staff are multifaceted, but I think it's fair to say it's a combination of poor management along with the ultimate cause, which is tight funding."
"1) The weather!!

Not too hot (usually) to do stuff, not too cold to gunge everything up.

Not too monotonous.

"I moved here from Australia and never looked back.

Everything is accessible - you can walk to the shops, to the pub. And if you can't walk there, there is usually decent public transport. I used to have to get a ¬£50 taxi home from a night out which was fairly standard, here I just walk home!

There are so many cities and towns close together that you can travel between them with ease. This isn't common in other countries, you might have to drive for a few hours to get to the next major city. It gives a greater sense of freedom rather being isolated to one city.

Most people just want to have a laugh and can laugh at themselves. The only other place that really does this is Australia, but people in Australia are way more aggressive. I've only seen British people get aggressive in fights on a night out and it usually ends with them hugging and apologising. Most people are genuinely pleasant and very charming.

NHS, everyone would live completely different lives without it.

Having the pub as a social hub. One thing that I find really British is being able to stand in line at the bar, the person next to me starts talking to me and we have a 2 minute chat, one of us gets served and you say bye and never see them again. There's no real intention behind it, just being friendly and having a chat. To be fair, I live in Yorkshire though. In other countries if some stranger starts talking to you out of the blue, usually you think something is up.

The history. I moved here 9 years ago and at first I was amazed by the architecture, and the old buildings and how I was using the same roads as people would have done hundreds of years ago. I've adapted now and don't think about it but it's something that is pretty cool.

The juxtaposition of everything. A lot of people are emotionally reserved and polite, but then after a drink they become total opposites. Being able to go into a run down city centre and then 10 minute drive out there's beautiful countryside. 

People are allowed to embrace their individualism. People here are interesting. In Australia (and the US) I always find everyone falls into these stereotypes and the conversation is always about property prices. Everyone I met in the UK seems to have much personality and the conversations are interesting.

And finally I feel like there is some sense of collectivism (even with all the shit going on in the country). When people have to band together, they do. I don't know if this is some sort of cultural repercussion from 2 wars, or having such a high population density, or something like that."
"You can walk on them as long as they're not motorways. In general you want to walk toward traffic, although you might want to cross over if you're approaching a sharp bend so you're on the outside. Basically you want to be able to see cars coming. It's a good idea to avoid using earphones and wear something bright if it's a dark or dull day.

Using the cycle lane is safer than walking on the road. Just move in as much as you can if there are bikes."

"Yes, I do fear an overall dismantling of the NHS just for US health insurance companies can swoop in and rake in the profits from the private healthcare system which would replace it. Not only would it result in everyone paying exorbitant insurance fees, it would also result in a lower national GDP because the productivity of the average worker would go down. 

This is mainly because wages aren't keeping up with inflation at the moment, and people are already feeling the pinch without health insurance- and if the average worker can't afford health insurance, their productivity goes down as they are sick more often. Thus having a knock on effect on national GDP.

I can also see employees' rights such as sick leave being reduced after employer lobbying because companies would be haemorrhaging money from the increase in sick days etc. due to factors outlined above."

"Here‚Äôs an anecdote for you: my neighbour had a heart attack last year. An ambulance attended him, staffed by paramedics. Then a helicopter with a doctor and two paramedics airlifted hi to hospital. There he was taken within minutes directly to a cutting-edge cardiac unit where they scanned the arteries in his heart, used drugs to disperse the clot, and inserted a stent. He was monitored for 2 weeks in hospital, fed good food and cared for by a team of nurses and cardiologists. Then he was discharged with the drugs he needs, and had a series of follow-up doctor appointments and a nurse visit to his home to assess his recovery. 

And all of this was free."
"Absolutely.   
   
The existential threat to the NHS is less one of overnight abolition, more of death by a thousand cuts. Selling it off piece by piece, all the while keeping it under the NHS 'brand'. I don't see that gradual approach of privatisation changing any time soon, because the NHS is precious to the majority; but they can get away gutting the service until it's NHS only by name - til it's too late to reverse what's done. No public service can be trusted in the hands of the Cons, nor any party similarly espousing pure, free-market capitalism and a 'sod the poor' mentality.     
    
What Brexit adds to the equation is greater vulnerability. You have predatory sociopathic capitalists like Trump et al who see dollar signs (not pound signs) in a weakened, dependent UK, and you have major parties like Labour - who are committed to the NHS - losing ground.  
   
We're in an incredibly vulnerable position, and shouldn't allow the sacrifice of one of our greatest successes while our eyes are on other issues. The NHS is, for me, the big red line; I'd go to war with these c*nts if it meant protecting it."
