"No worries :-)
My story is strikingly similar to most other survivors, and so all I want to do now is try and tell people what I needed back then, but didn’t get or wasn’t able to ask for."
"What we did, old foldout table from local auction house, saw of the legs to required height, painted and lacquered it funky colours. When not dining, it turns into a coffee table."
"Buy small table

"My mum tried several times to get us to drink tea as kids, but I’ve never liked the taste. I’m in my late 30’s now and will probably never drink tea "
I'm replying to a new situation now. I agree they should but that will be very hard to enforce.
I'm walking distance from Clapham Junction so Windsor is potentially even closer. 
"They actually go by ""Wales"" as a surname.

Source: Played cricket against Prince William. His name in the scorebook was given as ""William Wales""."
"Unless you're from Pity Me, at which point you just need to use that for maximum confusion at all times."
"Perfect! In that case, I'd add Guildford to your list. Get one of the trains that is first stop Guildford (or 2nd stop after Woking) from Clapham J and you'll find yourself in a stunning Surrey market town in &lt;30 min. The high street/castle area is really nice. Stoke Park is worth a walk around and there's a big art deco cathedral up on the hill/uni campus."
"Dang, I can't edit the title."
I'd probably go with someone like Monzo - then you can use it for cheap foreign exchange when you go abroad.
Canterbury is a breeze thanks to the HS1 from St Pancras. Windsor is an hour or so via Waterloo. Both really nice old towns.
"Never, I've had it a few times when people insist that I don't like it because I've never had their tea. I just don't see the appeal, I either drink water or alcohol anything else seems pointless."
milky tea in a bottle  and sit on the floor drinking it next to the dog who was also having a tea in her water bowl.
"Well, thanks for being supportive mate, I appreciate it. Didn't mean to go on a MH-related tangent lol but was just frustrated at the commenter saying I wasn't trying hard enough to get a good night's sleep every night in reasonable hours like a ""normal"" person (which I can typically do, when I'm not in full blown mania, but it's not something I can just turn off lol, especially unmedicated as I am currently)."
"Just had a look, didn't know those trains were so quick. Definitely a possibility!"
"I've got a picture somewhere of me as a baby, not sure exactly what age with my bottle containing tea. Mum says she uses to let it cool down a lot before letting me have it thankfully! "
"We had a strange rule in our house, that we weren’t allowed to drink tea/coffee until our 13th birthday. 

*However* if you think my parents were just worried about us burning ourselves on hot water, you’d be wrong. We might not have been allowed to *drink* it until age 13, but they had no problem with us *making* it for them. I don’t recall what age I started, but I do remember having a red plastic step so I could reach the counter, so I must have been pretty young.

When asked, my Mum says it was just one of my Dads weird rules (which does seem very plausible) and my Dad says I’m just misremembering it. But he says that about every questionable decision he has made, and everyone that knew us back then remembers it, so I suspect there wasn’t any particular reason. I wonder if they might have been concerned about the caffeine possibly? But as neither have tried that as a reason, it problem wasn’t that."
"No, just sticking to council legalities would be a good start."
"Absolutely good for basics like others have said.  I will caution against the shoes, I tried on walking sandals and the left and right were different sizes even though they were supposed to be the same.  I went through all of the ones in my size and each sandal was different."
"It is absolutely the same (and in some cases it’s even cheaper because it has *weekly* caps as well, as opposed to daily only on Oyster).

However, Oyster is still the way to go if you have any discounts to add (Railcards etc.) as these can’t be added to your bank card, of course.

Also OP is American and says they don’t have contactless cards anyway."
"Same! You're right, it's a bit disconcerting to think I've been drinking the same brand of tea for 20+ years. "
Rutland?
"Siren Sister

Oo-er sounds a bit pervy"
"Correct. It's commonly called ""Siren"". 

Siren-ces-ter. "
"I remember being given milky tea in a beaker when I was really small.

I'm pretty sure my mother considers my dislike of tea her greatest failure.
"/u/liberaldouche1234 - GET A MEDICAL FIRST. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. 

Before you do anything related to flying, spend the £150 on a medical. I had flying lessons when I was a teen, stopped for various reasons and then wanted to get back into it last year. 

I decided it was a good idea to have a medical done just to get it of the way and it turns out I’d have wasted a fortune (even more so than I already have) if I’d waited until I was about to go solo.

In the time in between I’d been diagnosed with ADHD, and both the condition and the medication used to treat it are completely disqualifying at every level, even NPPL/LAPL. I had no idea and I never had any issues previously (nor do I with driving etc) but they do not fuck around with this stuff. 

Gutted is an understatement but I’m much less gutted than if I’d spent a few thousand quid before finding out!

If you’re in the Manchester area I can highly recommend the guy I used, drop me a PM if you’re interested.

Nailed it. 
"We had staff come round to make sure the windows were open at night, in Scotland in winter, to save having to deal with the damp problem. No heating was installed."
"&gt;When he was still leader of the EDL the EDL met with the Norway terrorist Anders Brevik he also praises the EDL in his terrorist manifesto.

Jesus Christ. Not that I play too close attention to the man, but I'm surprised this has never come up when I've been reading about him or seeing arguments online. Open dialogue with a mass murdering terrorist. He is identical to the type of extremist he's made a living out of hating.

"
"No. I had no part of it.

On the flipside, I take no shame from shit that Britain has done either, since again, I had no part in it (or in all cases voted against it!)"
"Shame about LK Bennett - but these brands all seem to have the same issue. They’re ‘high street luxury’ - but the reality is, how many people can spend £200+ a dress? "
"Oh it takes a while (and a lot of money) to get to the upper snob tier. 

Firstly, to flex my snobbiness, Moka pot coffee isn't real espresso as there isn't enough pressure to it. It's still nice and strong though, it's somewhat inbetween. Moka is difficult to get right though. Make sure you use warm water half way to boiling in the bottom, don't tamp down the coffee, keep it on a low heat and take off it before it's finished. 

I started with a cafetiere, then aeropress, then moka pot. I've dabbled in pourovers but it's too much faffing for me first thing in the morning. Now I use an espresso machine, while it's the mostly costly, it's my favourite by far. Lots of versatility. Espresso if I'm short for time, Americano normally, and cappuccino when I'm feeling fancy. 

Beans make the least difference, IMO, after method and grinder. Cheap beans are horrible though. Supermarket wise; Sainsbury's have the best selection by far. Taylors have a decent one too. Online, your best bet is ""Rave Coffee"". They roast the beans fresh, specific to your order, and they have a nice selection. Thoroughly recommend them, but I'm not even the slightest bit bothered if I run out and have to nip to Sainsbury's. 

Hope all that helps a little. "
"So, is it a scam or weird advertising?"
You are not alone in that assessment
"They still sell proper Cherry coke, none of that nasty sweetener shit for me! https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Coca-Cola-Cherry-15L/400695011?from=shop&amp;tags=103644%7C155074%7C155070

"I knew getting a medical first was essential but I don't know it was THIS important! I'm so sorry that happened to you, dude. Thanks for the advice. "
Imperialistic question of the day
I don't think tea is good for dogs. Theophylline in chocolate is toxic to dogs and caffeine is closely related. I'm a human vet though so could be wrong.
"I've found that their shoes are, generally, very narrow so no good for people with average to wide feet."
I don't think the answer is quite as black or white as that.
I'm a social work student so I'll be fine. 😂
Luton 
this is so british
Why not call them up and ask?
"Possible identity theft? Maybe someone has signed up to an account under your name. Not sure how they would be able to access it without intercepting your post though.

Maybe try calling NatWest. But look up their number first, don't trust anything printed on the letters you've received in case it is a scam."
"&gt;Presumably overtime and compressed working was discussed during the interview process?

We did discuss about compressed hours, they just said it's available. I didn't have any specific needs to require compressed, so my query was more like 'is it available' and left it at that.

They said overtime was also available but again, left it at that. I don't care if it's guruanteed or not, "
"Presumably overtime and compressed working was discussed during the interview process?

Personally i'd say it's pretty bad form to ask for anything on the first day, get your feet under the table and see the lie of the land first - exception to this would be if it was explicitly discussed during the interview process.  An example might be a parent specifically wanting a job with compressed working to manage childcare needs, or someone working away from 'home' and travelling a long distance."
"&gt; Vodafone is non-existent in Lancaster, where I went to Uni.

Definitely the further away from the South East you get the worse it is. There's stretches of the M62 and A1 where despite having a good signal strength on Vodafone throughput is non-existent. In the several years I was with Three I never experienced that. A friend of mine is on EE and hasn't complained but their pricing for me wasn't competitive last time I looked."
"Aye, it's tough to enforce but simultaneously people shouldn't be *complete* doormats in these situations."
"Are you even British??

Thanks.
I've tried but my tv changes it back again as soon as I click ok.

"If OP goes to Salisbury, make sure to go and see the cathedral. I hear it's really popular with Russians though, so it could be busy."
"Not in the slightest.

I am happy to be English because it has afforded me a nice life, and a decent place to live. Take no pride in it though. I think it's pathetic when anyone shows any patriotism at all tbh. Can't think of any countries that are equal and democratic enough that you have a right to be proud of it.

"Always lived in London, born to a Chinese-Malaysian mother and an English father. Going by this I should enjoy all sorts of different types of tea like my parents, yet, I never wanted to try as a kid - I was fussy. First tea I had was when I was 16 and fell asleep in my geography class (pulled an all-nighter for ICT coursework which I was rewriting completely) which had a lot of sugar added as my teacher wanted to wake me up (she sent me home after that). I didn't like it. Next time I had tea was Chinese tea at 24 - it was ok, but a bit bitter at the end.

"Surprisingly, no-one has said the actual root cause of the answer: the Royal Family changed their surnames by Act of Parliament during WW1 because anti-German sentiment during the war made it politically awkward to have the country headed by a family with a German name. They therefore had their name changed to the most British name they could think of (that of Windsor Castle, one of the primary royal residences), and furthermore it has recently been announced that all future monarchs will automatically assume the surname Windsor from now on, regardless of whether they should in fact inherit a different surname from the male line, thus meaning that from now until the end of time (or the end of the monarchy, I guess), the House of Windsor will always be the active royal dynasty."
"It'll be VPNs and Tor that they'll go to, both are things that the surveillance element of our government are itching to get at. They'll come next as the bogey man exposing our kids to porn and they'll try banning it (banning VPNs alone eill be difficult).

I used to work in a charity shop a few years ago and it's absolutely shocking how much theft went on. Often it would be families who would give items to their children to carry or wear out the shop. Shoplifting is one thing but using your kids as tools for it is another.

"Ok I’m currently rly enjoying “What The Fact?!” It’s pretty much a mix of everything I look for in a podcast. The stories they tell are either true crime or paranormal or alien stories.  Then at the end they tell a fact somewhat related to the stories. But the facts are always Super interesting.

"French is spoken in France, some bits of Africa and a bit of Canada where they speak in an incomprehensible dialect.

Whereas Spanish is something like the second most widely spoken first language. It covers Spain, Mexico and all of South America (except Brazil), the Canary islands and other Spanish territories. It is more useful for hot holidays too. 

But that is just my opinion. I found it much easier to learn and understand as well. In 2 years of Spanish I reach similar comprehension as I had after 7 years of French."
