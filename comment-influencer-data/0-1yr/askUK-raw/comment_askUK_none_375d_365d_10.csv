Vomit on your top is optional but highly popular.
Just remember to use your indoor voice 
Lol
"Sounds like there may be something dodgy going on if their asking proof you deleted this info. 

Tell them you want a company phone if they want to see what’s on it. "
"They misunderstand what everyone else does, produce meaningless job specs that bear no resemblance to reality, think the 1970s was a golden age, and refuse to change any process because it's worked just fine for the last 40 years.

On the upside, they aren't accountable for anything and are the last people to be let go when cuts are needed."
"&gt;Should I have confronted them?  
  
Absolutely not. Swallow your pride and don't give them the benefit of your attention.  
As a general rule, if you have to give thought about confronting somebody who may be potentially aggressive, then don't."
If only I could find somewhere offering lessons. Tried Google... 
Love you! We love everyone really unless they're an arsehole. The hating of the French is just jest.
Yes the parent is responsible for the child until they turn 18 unless otherwise ordered by a court. It's not optional.
"A couple of months ago I found out that a (perfectly capable, normal) colleague had never heard of Brexit. To be honest I decided not to enlighten her, she looked a lot happier than the rest of us."
I call it the condom. And it is definitely not meant to be eaten. Your missus is weird. 
"Frankly, yes. It's not right, but if you're working with people who don't share your accent it's likely to reflect as a negative.

That's not to say they think you're thick, or that you can't do the job. Some of the best engineers I've worked with have had crazy thick accents so they obviously managed with it!

But if you're straight up asking if it makes any difference, then I think it does."
"My message is 100% positive.

1) You are not old and a has-been. I speak as someone who is nearly 60.

2) In general, people are behaving ""younger""

3) A very high % of people stuff up the relationships they think are for life, when they are younger. So NOT being settled down yet is not a problem at all.

4) The biological clock actually means that people DO want to settle down in their thirties.

5) I too did not compromise my freedom, and I am happy to say that my two best relationships were indeed in my 40s and now.

6) People tend to hang out with people at the same life-stage. So if you are still with people who settled down earlier, then you might well feel out of place. However, there are loads of other people out there looking, so to speak.

7) CasualUK did a user survey the other month and the AVERAGE age was mid-30s, so even by UK reddit standards you are 'normal.'

8) I can even say that in terms of work, I did several things in my mid 30s and later which were different from what I did before, and starting later was not a problem."

You should definitely trust your gut and not stay somewhere you think is dodgy."
"The overpriced places might be where you'll find the older crowd, because the 18-19 year olds are priced out of going there. 

What kind of music are you into? If you really want to meet people at clubs go to clubs that play specifically that type of music. That way you'll have at least 1 thing in common with the other people there, beyond purely wanting to get pissed. "

""Can I see the screen, please?""

I mean, it sounds sketchy as, but what are you going to do really?"
"Yes, mate. That's fucked. Jesus. People like that boil my piss."
It's usually better quality.
Jesus christ I'm in my 30s and this makes me want to jump off a bridge I feel so old.

"&gt; I call my girlfriend a dickhead all the time. 

My other-half is still learning how to do ""bants"" as he works in a very PC and ""safe"" environment, he's just never really been exposed to it. He's getting better at it, but sometimes I'll call him a dickhead or a tart, and in response he tells me that my mum never loved me or that I'm going to die young. He's still learning how to balance *funny vs. actually hurts*. Overall it's adorable, but you know, once I've stopped crying."
"Yes, call your local council's child safeguarding line and make a referral, you can do it anonymously."
"Thank you so, so much for showing me this place. I'm booked in now and in an Uber there. "
"One time at uni (ETA: in the 1990s, pre-smart phones) we were a few beers in when a friend ran out of money and realised they'd left their debit card back in halls.  A female friend said ""that's OK, you can just go to the cash point and put your PIN in and it'll give you cash without your card""

Three of us could not find a way to explain to her not just that this didn't work, but more importantly *why* it wouldn't work.  She couldn't get her head around the fact that the bank needed to know who you were independently of your PIN, she just kept saying 'but it's your PIN, that's how they know which account to take the money from'.

To be fair, we were all a few beers in &amp; perhaps not explaining things brilliantly, but it was like opening up somone's brain and finding it was a terrifying pit of tangled worms and realising there was no logical connection between the way this brain and your brain thought about the world."
"Worth noting that it's not even a one-directional thing, it's not just that ""posh"" people look down on people with regional accents; you'd also really struggle speaking Queen's English working in a garage, for example. You'd get the piss taken endlessly. "
"Don't wear anything with an EU flag, though it might cause the arse in charge to have a heart attack... so.. no downside I guess?"
"It's not just quality, you're also paying for then to stock more niche products, there are things I can get from Waitrose that I can't get from most other main supermarkets. More range generally means higher prices which is partly why Aldi etc are cheap."
Nobody will give a shit.
"Because the chip and pin part may well have a cloner on it, while the tap and pay part doesn't? It's a favourite of many petrol stations around here."
You're the odd one in this story 
"&gt; The overpriced places might be where you'll find the older crowd, because the 18-19 year olds are priced out of going there.

Bingo. The older you are, the more likely you are to pay for the pleasure of not being surrounded by the younger crowd."
"They almost certainly were hoping you’d confront them so that they could make something out of it. They were trying to provoke you into a scrap. Imho you absolutely the right thing by ignoring them. 

Try to put them out of your mind, and enjoy your week!"
"You could produce an ancient nokia and then explain you only access emails on PC at home. 

But no, I don't believe they have a right to do this unless it's specified in your contract. Your phone is your personal property. Would you let them search your bag on request? They shouldn't be emailing rotas anywhere outside the organisation, imo. "
Not a great deal. You'll probably be mistaken for Australian a lot. 
"Not nearly as humiliated as if you mouthed off back and they beat you down.

Are you taking the piss? You sound 12 not 22. "
"After reading all these comments I feel like I've uncovered some big conspiracy. But something definitely is going on and I highly suspect its to do with the upcoming inspection.

If they gave me a company phone I wouldn't think twice about letting them search through it but they're too tight to be giving everyone a work phone. Thanks for the comment pal! "
"Also, be aware that England has a love/hate relationship with itself, on top of our history with the other places in the UK.

"Job spec writing, often first round interviewing too

Legal advice (eg yes Mr warehouse manager it is a mandatory requirement that your staff get breaks)

Wage negotiations (although usually there's a separate department called payroll to pay it)

The go to for handling dismissal, resignations and disciplinaries

In some cases health and safety (usually it's subcontracted out)

The go to for basic information such as pay queries, maternity and paternity rights, company cars, sick leave rights, support for mental health, LGBT, BAME and so forth

Employee relations with unions

Ensuring employees are auto-enrolled in pensions (legal requirement)

Training of staff (whether legal required training or desired)

Setting of HR policies such as time management, expenses, travel, disciplinary procedures

Managing of managers (with much of the above)

Employee development assistance (eg identifying and supporting high achievers to fast track them with support)

Performance appraisals and bonus decisions

Larger companies may have internal employee support eg point you to counselling or maybe have an internal fund for financially stricken employees (ours gave £5k to one low paid employee for specialist medical equipment for their six year old that couldn't be funded by the NHS)

Running anonymous whistle blowing facilities (again this is often subcontracted out)

"We were at a barbecue recently and me and my SO were talking to one of her friends. Don’t ask me how this came up but It came to light that one of our other Friends only had one ‘man plumb’, so to speak.

The girl then proceeds to ask that if he had kids, could he only have a boy or a girl. She was under the impression that each testical produced a ‘male or female’ sperm respectively. 

This lady has had 3 children. Many laughs were shared at her expense."

"Parts of it are rough, parts of it are lovely, like any major city. Most of what you hear is;

A) uninformed foreigners who have never been to the UK (usually Americans, who think it's under Sharia law.....) or 

B) Brits poking fun at Brum, like you would poke fun at a younger ginger brother with a weird speech impediment, but it's out of love. Deep, deep, deep down. Very deep. And it's like, a tiny amount of love, not really worth mentioning."
"Unfortunately, you have no rights here. They don't have to be accommodating or compassionate.

"If you get yourself some proper training (NOT just the CBT), decent protective gear, and don't ride like a dickhead, then yes it can be safer than cycling. For the simple reason that you should be able to keep up with cars and lorries doing 30-40 mph which allows you to position yourself central in the lane. On a bicycle on those less congested roads you end up pushed towards the gutter and then idiot car drivers perform dodgy overtakes.

But you do need confidence to ride a moped like that (it's easier on a more powerful motorbike) which is why I said you should go along to a training centre and take some lessons from professional instructors. Because if you look unsure and unsafe the car drivers WILL treat you exactly like a bicycle, and then you become just as vulnerable as they are."
"The English are friendly enough, even though there will be a brief adjustment period for you to adjust your social standards from our expectations to theirs. The English aren't particularly more or less xenophobic than Americans, and there, just as here, you're more likely to find casual racism the further you go from major cities, where migration and ethnic demographics tend to be more static.

Source: am an American who lived in England for 20 years."
"As someone who moved countries a few times, it's actually hardest to move between English speaking countries.

That's because people think that since we speak the same language, there'll be an automatic rapport. For the most part, social norms and interacting styles are completely different. The UK isn't a European version of America. Since you'll be dealing with British people whom nearly all of them have only lived in the UK, you can't expect them to have your understanding. So just like with being a guest in any other country, you have to adapt and adjust yourself to get on the same wavelength as locals which can be a lonely, exhausting process that takes many years but well worth it in the end.

The only way to adapt is completely let go of your preconceptions and try to observe the how and why of British people's habits and adopt a ""new skin"" so to speak. Over time, you'll learn to let go the American habits/preconceptions you didn't realise you had, cultivating the essence of who you are and integrating the best part of British/European people into yourself (or none at all if you don't want to) whilst realising the common objective truths out there that unite all humans."
"No, don't confront them. For future reference, you can [text the British Transport Police on 61016](http://www.btp.police.uk/61016_text_service/how_to_use_the_text_number-1.aspx) for discreet non-emergency reports - make sure you include enough details about the train that you're on, so that it can be tracked down and they can be dealt with as appropriate."

"&gt; I don't want to give my money to a country or ideology that I don't agree with.

Why are you going there then?"
"This is how it works.

Say I'm a carrot supplier, Top Carrots Inc. with three supermarkets after my stocks:

`1. Waitrose:

""We want the only the really pointy round orange carrots""

Okay, I'll charge you a bit more. They're the best carrots and I need people / a machine for pointy carrot sorting.

`2. Tesco

""It's gotta be round and orange. But our customers don't care for pointy"".

Ok, I'll charge you an okay price. I still have to care about colour and roundness but it's fine.

`3. Jack's

""Is it mostly orange? Eh it'll do""

Ok, I'll charge you a cheap price. I can give you all the carrots that didn't make the cut.

This way I sell all my carrots at the best possible price and all 3 supermarkets are pretty happy.

This is the same approach that airlines and events take when pricing tickets. Better views? Better comfort? Higher prices.

Should you shop at Jacks / Tesco's / Waitrose? How much do you care about getting my freshest, least nobbled, crunchiest carrots? Sure some of the Jack's carrots might be great, especially if there's a bumper crop. But if not, it might be titchy carrots that are a bit mis-shaped and maybe less fresh."

Better to have a bruised ego than a broken jaw
"You mention things being overpriced twice. Perhaps what you consider overpriced is simply normal for other professionals? Like in the back of my head I think that £8 at a cocktail bar (the one I go to) is really very expensive but then I compare it to all the other professional bars rather than the cheap nightclubs and student places and I realize it's quite normal. So yeah, it's a lot of money, but it's not technically overpriced when compared to other experiences. It's overpriced compared to doing shots at home or the £1.50 jelly shots at the student union, yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to be looking for bars that professionals are likely to go to after work - cocktails, decent wine, probably higher security, clean, trendy, nearby to workplaces and transport systems. Maybe try the sub for your city/area for some recommendations. Fact is, they're going to be more expensive than the clubs and pubs that you find 18 year olds and young students in though. Students and professionals are different clientele."
"It doesn't really matter if it's a ""proper"" disorder or just some shitty thought pattern that you got stuck in somehow, what matters is that it's affecting your life negatively and you can't seem to fix it yourself. 

Which means you should seek professional help, and let the professionals figure out the cause and the solution. You're seeing it as a problem yourself and is willing to get it sorted, which is a great start, so hopefully you'll find your way back to your old self. Good luck!"
