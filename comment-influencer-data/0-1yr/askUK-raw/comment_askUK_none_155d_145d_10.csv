Good on the owner."
"Not sure an escort is quite what you want. They are regarded as quite a small car. You might want to look at something more like a Qashqai, or if you have the budget go for an F-Pace. Big but very shapely, very sexy."
"Haha, definitely not."
"I've not been stopped and have even seen people being burgers in from next door which I think is taking the piss a bit, mainly because of the smell."
By earning the wage of two people
"&gt;The pay is decent  
  
Unusual in a lot of charities, they pay in soul credits and less in real world money  
  
&gt;the contract only runs until 2022  
  
3 years is a very long time in the world of work from what I've seen  
  
&gt;And I'm nearing my 30's where I ""should"" be settled down instead of chopping and changing.  
  
Bollocks to that, variety spice of life etc etc"
I love this sub
It's fine but be aware choke collars tend to be frowned upon.
Just the tip?
"This guy is 100% right. Cleaning person was being nice and, assuming it was yours, left it somewhere you could find it.

I actually asked the hotel if they could provide condoms once when I was having a spontaneous threesome (I left my partners in the room to go hunting them). The front desk receptionist politely said they don't have any, but he drew me a map to the nearest shop that would have them. He kept a straight face the whole time... I should definitely have given him a tip now I think about it."

If he wants a big rear end on it he's probably after a cosworth and that will really set him back.
Rosie and Jim! Two the dolls on a river boat and the owner told stories about them. My friends never watched it
I still have regular daydreams about Bernard's Watch.
"I always take my own into the big chain cinemas but I wouldn't if I were going to a small independent one, it's the food and drink that keeps them open."
"I can see why people are slightly derogatory about cider, it's mostly the choice of children and the homeless."
"It's more the reason why, and the fact I'm struggling to say no now. It's becoming a compulsion."

"If you just prowl the right (or perhaps wrong in this case) streets and street corners, they're pretty hard to miss. 

Usually with a window smashed in and a alarm screaming into the night mourning the loss of a car radio."
"I have seen it before actually! A coffee shop I used to manage had a 5p price difference between black and with milk on Americano. 

It helped make the order clear during busy periods apparently... Owner never seemed to appreciate my ""why don't we just have another button"" comments.

Truth be told, I just said fuck that system and charged everyone the same, thereby giving free milk to the masses. 

Like a milky robin hood, except it was less taken from the rich and more the cows and my boss.

Which is funny because I'm actually deadly allergic to milk!"
"She definitely owns and not rents? If she owns, bank of mom and dad?

Your math is correct, you need a fucking huge deposit and a lender willing to risk 5x salary. Welcome to being young these days, we earn 45k combined and are nowhere near affording to buy a place."
"2-3 pints? 4-5 times a week? 
I don’t want to minimise what you are obviously very concerned about, but shit, unless that’s pints of wine or spirits, I don’t think you have a major problem here. 

Perhaps just try having a extra night per week off to start with and take it from there."
Yep yep.
Just straight up apply for jobs from Ireland if you like.
"Depends, are you after the mk1/2 RWD model (a bona fide classic now), or the mk3 FWD model from 1980 onwards...? Cossies make silly money these days btw."
"Had them as kids. Did buy one for our kid, but haven't really had cause to use it yet.

Queen's nose. It was the dog's. Also Michaelangelo.
"I can offer a different answer here! It’s possible that this is rooted in section 1.2g) of the Code of Fundraising Practice. It’s supported by a guide called “Treating Donors Fairly” released by the Institute of Fundraising, which outlines that the circumstances you describe here would put you in what the regulator calls a “potentially vulnerable situation”. 

Effectively, fundraisers are regulated to ensure that if you’re in a situation like this one, a charity can’t take advantage of any stress etc. Under the code, the guy you spoke to wouldn’t have been able to continue."

"If you download an app called trainline it'll break down your journey and also letnyou live track it, if I'm going somewhere unfamiliar I'll keep it open after I board and use the live tracker to keep an eye on how many stops are left, it also tells you what platforms you need to be on and you can buy tickets through it, hope that helps!"
As a female in her late 40’s I noticed this thread had accumulated lots of replies and came in here to see the advice offered. Was not disappointed
And the shock collars aren't approved for use until over 18months
"There was a CBBC show called Ghost Hunter in the early 2000s, it was about this scary old lady who was the title character, and the ghost was some Victorian chimney sweep boy called Rodney(?)...I remember the title sequence being scarier than the show itself"
I remember a TV show called Kerching. Must have been about 2003. The main kid was some kind of entrepreneur.
"I've been in gay hotels (yup, Brighton) and instead of tea and coffee tray, there was a selection of condoms and other delights. Bit annoying as i wanted tea and coffee, maybe a biscuit. Anal lube just doesn't hit the spot at 7am.

(Anyone can stay there of course, it's just very gay)."
"I'll answer your question directly, as you probably want a straight answer. 

If you are alcohol dependent confirmed by medical investigation you must not drive whatsoever, the doctor will likely inform the DVLA. You will likely not be able to drive until a year clear. 

Regardless, you clearly need help so I'd suggest you seek it."

"The only people who will give you funny looks are the people who either a) aren't parents or b) have never known the heart-pounding terror of chasing after a kid as it runs straight towards a busy road. 

Who gives a shit what others think, put him on a lead its as much for safety as anything else. 

Btw, after the Jamie Bulger case, parents stopped relying on ""I'll just turn round for a second"" behaviour and started putting velcro straps round their kids wrists.  If you want a reason to keep your kid attached to you, read the wiki about the case."
"As a 32 year old man, I am also intrigued."
"I had that ‘job’ going door to door for sign ups for proper charities via a third party company for a grand total of 2 days when I was 17. 

Simply getting the person details - to which the charity would have to contact them to reconfirm. Even if the person changed there mind at this point I’d get £20. 

10am-11pm, 6 days a week, no basic pay. Yeah, I Noped out."
Or a council house or housing association? Single parent working such few hours would mean they fit the classic criteria
How is the “female in her late 40s” part at all relevant to the rest of your comment?
He said go to the website and check mate.
*Only* runs until 2022? Lol what? That’s a very long contract and is quite unusual
"I remember having a door to door for a cancer charity konock at my door. At the time my dad was going through chemo for a rare type of leukemia, it was rough and we didn't think he was going to make it (he did, hurrah) - So this chugger starts going on about 'as you know many of us know someone with cancer...' to which I piped up and told him about my dad. His face dropped, he looked so fucking guilty and sad, then started blurting out 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'll leave you alone' and hurried off. 

It really made me think, why would a cancer charity rep freak out like that, wouldn't they want to chat about cancer? I was up for talking about it. That's when I realised they must have known the shit they were doing was shady as fuck and that person did not have the conscience to guilt trip me that day. That or they wanted a fast sign up and didn't want to have to actually deal with an actual cancer situation."

"&gt;it’s also costing me a fortune in bus fair and taxi etc

work should definitely be paying for this, they'd pay mileage otherwise.

"Funny story. We were a bunch of straight guys on a stag. The best man, not known for his liberal views (uneducated dimwit really) booked us all in.  He didn't see the tag line 'Brighton's premier Gay friendly hotel'. It was a nice place. We thought it was hilarious, especially as we were all paired up in rooms with only double beds available. 

In the morning, to see the best man's face, sat at breakfast, and every part of the walls covered in pictures of cocks.

Really odd part of the story, one of our group was Nick Leeson.  He was a bit weird.

Anyway, i stubbed my toe really fucking badly going into the bathroom. I looked down and saw a flood of blood literally racing across the floor. I'd torn the fucker open. I pretty much passed out, only to come round a few minutes later, in my boxers, with the two, very camp owners talking about whether they should do resuscitation. It was like a sitcom. Fucking hurt though. Anyway, nice place, recommended. Can't remember the name. Leeson i remember tried to not pay for Jack shit the whole time."

"Yes, at least in the main 3 chains in the UK (Cineworld, Odeon, and Vue).

[Cineworld](https://www.cineworld.co.uk/terms/in-cinema):

&gt;2.2 Alcohol and Food Policy: **Neither alcohol nor hot food may be brought onto the premises**.  Only hot food bought on the premises may be consumed on the premises.  Alcohol may only be purchased and consumed in Cineworld licensed bar areas or in licensed screens and licensing laws will be strictly enforced.

No mention of other food not being allowed. This is also confirmed because I used to work in Cineworld for 2 years, and there were no rules against anything other than hot food or alcohol.

[Vue](https://twitter.com/vuecinemas/status/954360286412201987?lang=en):

[Odeon](https://twitter.com/odeoncinemas/status/647351445650542592?lang=en):

&gt;You can bring your own food/drink as long as it's not hot or alcoholic

"Probably stay away from St Anne's, Radford, The Meadows but there's worse places to be. West Bridgford and The Park are your posher areas, I think a large amount of student population is concentrated in Lenton and Beeston.

"Woof.

"From my experience all the GP will do is refer you to somewhere else. Unless you were like me and you needed something to stop the shakes because you went cold turkey, you might as well look for a help place on your own if you are worried about the GP dobbing you in. See if there are some AA meetings in your area or a substance abuse place.  
  
Or you could tell your GP that you are stressed and worried you might start drinking heavily, ask about CBT or therapy? If they already know about your mental health issues you could start there."
"Lack of information surrounding local politicians (not even so much as a pamphlet through the door from any candidate!) and no information being available online surrounding the local candidate's stances on hot issues or topics (or any topics for that matter) lead me towards either not voting or spoiling my vote. I didn't get a chance to vote before heading to work and so am giving myself until the end of my shift to decide on whether I will vote at all or not. It certainly doesn't help that there are multiple candidates for each party; which would be of help if any of them had shared their viewpoints, but with no information simply leaves me even more in the dark..."
"The pub is my church, if that counts?"
You don't see many around now 'cause the rear wheel arches were so prone to rust.
"I used to work in recruitment and left because practices like this made me furious. Everything you described is exactly what I was told to do.
The day I left, it was because I'd been asked to fill a role for a huge FMCG company.  I was told to go find the person doing the exact same job at a competitor company, approach their boss and ask for a reference as if this poor innocent, happily working in his job had applied to a competitor, get his boss to have doubts about him. Then I was supposed to offer the doubtful boss someone from my files who wasn't quite right, take happy worker guy and sell him into the original company and collect two lots of comission. Obviously I was under instruction to up everyone's salary while doing it. 
I told my boss that was a shitty move and he told me that I wouldn't make it as a recruiter unless I was ""more of a cunt"" 
I walked straight out the door and never went back. 

My big regret is that I didn't warn Company A, Company B and happy worker guy that someone else from my company was probably going to get my exact same set of orders and try fuck every one up for a quick buck. 

I now fucking hate all recruiters. The huge majority are young guys who didn't get to uni and think they'll make a fast buck. The pressure and turnaround is frightening. 

I've seen and heard other practices in the industry that MUST be illegal."
"&gt; If you look at charities’ return on their investment when using third party agencies, then fundraisers are genuinely helping the causes they’re commissioned to.

That's the argument they use, ""By doing this work you're driving revenue the charity wouldn't otherwise have!"" but in order to drive those donations they rely on aggressive, invasive tactics on the street, and despite all of this, these companies are private enterprises profiting off the back of people's charitable giving. Fuck the lot of them IMO."

Have you tried cutting the bread underwater?
"It's doubtful they have the funding to regularly pick it all up (at least, my council doesn't) but there's no harm in writing to them and your local councillor(s). 

It's easy (as bad quite fun) to set up your own group, the council may have equipment you can borrow. Then you just let the council know that you're doing a litter pick and afterwards call them up with the location of the rubbish and how much it weighs and they will come collect the bags."

I don't remember where it was, Dorset or Shropshire, I went into one which had freshly baked bread and cakes - not just the frozen-and-bake-in-the-shop but actually made by a human.  Others are just filled with tins of booze for the folk spending their days on the benches outside."

"Speak to your GP. 

They have a duty to inform the DVLA if you're at risk or posing a risk to others - your drinking habits don't create such a risk, and you can make that clear to your GP. 

There are a lot of people in the comments - and perhaps you yourself - conflating two different drinking problems. 

**Functional alcoholics** are basically incapable of operating without alcohol in their system - they're the kind of alcoholic who has a drink immediately upon waking. You're not this kind of alcoholic. You're not basically drunk all the time. Most importantly: you're not driving drunk. 

You're an antisocial drinker (i.e. you're drinking by yourself and getting depressed). You're likely using it to self-medicate. This can grow into the latter problem (or a number of other related drinking problems). But you're not there yet. 

Speak to your GP, explain your problem - and by all means explain your concern about losing your license; that's a really good reason to get your drinking under control **now**, and before it spreads into the rest of your life. 

And well done for identifying that it's becoming a problem - don't let the ""I drink more than that!"" comments dishearten you; alcoholism isn't an 'amount of alcohol' problem, it's a ***behavioural*** problem (as I think you know). 

Dealing with it sooner rather than later will make it a hell of a lot easier - and it's likely all wrapped up in the rest of your mental health, so addressing one will mean addressing the other. 

Speak to your GP, get treatment. You deserve to get better."

"We don't tend to call those 'leashes' here either, for the record. In British English it's usually called a 'lead'.

To answer your question though, my parents had reins for me and my sister and I wouldn't hesitate to use them on my own kids in the future. Even if you just have the strap fastened around your wrist and hold their hand normally, it's a good insurance policy in case they suddenly break free and try to run away."
Don't know if making a joke a bout cars counts as being a SJW
"Booking
--------
You can book with an app like thetrainline, or download one of the train company apps (like Virgin, LNER etc).  It doesn't matter which one, they all sell the same tickets, even if it's not their own train. (e.g. I like to use Virgin app even though Virgin doesn't serve the same route that I travel on). Thetrainline will be more expensive because they charge a booking fee, which the others don't.  If you need to change trains the app will tell you this before you book the ticket.  

Make sure you tick the ""request a reserved seat"" box when booking.  Many trains are very busy and if don't have a seat reservation and it's full, you'll have to stand. Reserved seats are usually free with your ticket.

If you're anxious about booking you can go to a train station and buy a ticket at the counter, which might be helpful as the staff will explain the changes you might need to make. 

Buy the ticket as early as you can - a bit like airplane tickets, the train tickets get more and more expensive the closer to the date, and are very very expensive (like potentially in the £100s) if you buy a ticket the same day that you travel.  It'll be much cheaper the earlier you book.

Arriving at the station
------------------------
Allow plenty of time at the station, because you will have to find the right platform after arriving.  When you arrive, there will be a huge electronic board at the front of the station that lists all the trains departing soon.  Usually they're arranged left to right, with the train on the left leaving first, and then the train next to it leaving next and so on.  Each board shows a single train, its scheduled departure time, whether it's running late or on time, lists all the stops it makes, and tells you the platform.  

Find your train on the board (they are identified by departure time), look for the platform you need and then follow the signs to find that platform.  If this is confusing there are always staff in uniforms who are there specifically to answer questions and give you directions if you're stuck - just show them your ticket and ask for help to find your train if you're stuck.  

On the platform itself there will be more electronic screens showing details for the next train to arrive there - double check it's the right one for you before boarding a train.  The train itself usually has a paper note or an electronic sign next to the entry door, telling you the stops it calls at.  There are always more staff in uniform on the platform that you can ask if you're anxious.  And there are announcements over the station tannoy telling you which platform for which train.

On board
---------
If you have a seat reservation you're supposed to sit in it, but if the train is quiet I just find a spare double seat and sit in it without using my reserved seat, and that's fine. The seat reservation will say something like ""D54A"".  That means ""carriage D seat 54"" (the A is pointless and you can ignore it).  You can sit in any unreserved seat, and you can also sit in a reserved seat if no one is actually using it (many people have a free reservation they don't need). If you want to use your reserved seat and someone is sitting in it, that's not a problem (happens all the time), just politely point out that you've reserved the seat and they'll move. How do you know if a seat is reserved?  On most trains there's either a paper ticket stuck in the headrest, or an electronic sign above your head in the luggage rack, telling which stations it starts being reserved.  

There's a small shelf above your head where you can put bags, and big luggage like suitcases has to go in a luggage rack which will be by the door. Keep your valuables on your person.

There's always a guard on the train.  At some point they'll come around and ask to check your ticket.  They'll also make announcements (sometimes pre-recorded) before and after each stop. They tell you ""we're shortly arriving at station x.  Change here for Leeds"" before you arrive, and then afterwards they tell you ""welcome to the 17:48 service to Leeds, calling at x, y and z.  The next station stop will be x, in 20 minutes.""  So you always know which stop to get off at - you can track it live, and also listen out for announcements.  Most modern trains also have an electronic screen of some kind inside the carriage that tells you which stop is next."
Monkey Dust. I don’t think ill EVER forget that thing. Its like everyone refuses to remember it.
