"You absolutely did the right thing. Where there's a legal justification for asking someone to temporarily remove their face covering (e.g. to see if presented photo I.D. matches the customer) then you should do so. If the customer refuses, then end of transaction. She might not be happy, but it's the customer who is choosing to wear something which conceals her identity, and that makes fulfilling your legal obligations difficult.   
   
I hope if she _does_ complain, your employers give you a pat on the back for upholding the law. I'm sure plenty of people don't ask for fear of being perceived as culturally insensitive, which just leads to one rule for one group, a different rule for another. "

"Corned beef is extremely volatile and can explode if dropped or mishandled. The key allows the tins to be manufactured to withstand higher pressures and incidences of denting/piercing while also acting as a safety device to prevent accidental opening and catastrophic expansion of the contents in uncontrolled circumstances.  
  
It also allows the tin to be tapered, allowing for safer and easier removal when required."

I haven't seen anyone in a burqa here so that's pretty odd. However, no reasonable Muslim woman would take offense to getting ID'ed... If you had a photo ID of her, you already knew what she looks like under the veil.

Anyone really strict would have just requested a female colleague of your's check it.

There was definitely something fishy going on here. You did the right thing."
"It was used widely in WW1 as a cheap and sustainable alternative to the more effective but significantly more expensive MkII (Mills) Grenade.  
Although it wasn't nearly as deadly, it could still very well inflict severe damage to the digits or take an eye out, leaving your target maimed. It also provided the troops with much needed nutritional sustenance whilst spending weeks in the trenches.

"One wants to know why you put washing up liquid in a kettle.

You have two options in my view. Buy a new kettle, or run gallons and gallons of water through the kettle."
You're tucked up in bed. No need to heat the house. Waste of money. 
"Judging by your comment about ""working for a few years"" I'm guessing you're already over twenty, so this isn't some childish thing. I'm going to treat this as though you're an adult seriously intending to leave ASAP.

Sadly, the world is capitalist so you're rather screwed for not having money. Serious plan, having done this myself a few times:

Save up in any way you can. *Any way you can*. /r/EatCheapAndHealthy can help you. /r/frugal is a fun circlejerk but don't take it seriously. Reduce usage of anything from electricity to paper. Don't skimp on heating (but do make sure you're wearing layers before you turn it on). It's not worth it. I still associate feeling mildly cold inside with soul-crushing poverty.

Start packing. Ideally now. Less ideally, tomorrow. The sooner you're packed the better. As you pack, ask yourself: ""Do I need to take this with me?"" If the answer is no, designate a place for it and all its ilk. Split them up into ""can conceivably make a profit (discounting postage) selling this online - and do so soon"", ""belongs in the nearest charity shop"", and ""belongs in the nearest bin"". Be generous with the bin pile. I'm serious. Charity shops throw away an absolute fuckton of shit people give to them because they're not in an utterly unrecognisable state. If you wouldn't give it to a stranger on the street, you shouldn't give it to a charity shop.

Tell your therapist about all the junk you're glad you've gotten rid of. Discuss how unburdening it is to remove it from your home, to box everything else up. How freeing it is to feel you're finally escaping this horrible village. Then actually escape it.

(Aside: If you don't have a therapist, make that the final step in this endeavour, but request a referral to one now. By the time you've moved and updated your address with your GP, it'll still be three months before you actually get a letter.)

You can put yourself on lists for council houses or private-rent places in whatever random towns/cities appeal to you; but I've always had the most success moving by answering an advert (or putting out my own) for a house-swap. If you're in a cute village where people care about other people's gardens, odds are someone in the city desperately wants to move there. Sometimes even someone who doesn't want to move there will anyway - I once swapped with someone who was only moving to be closer to work, and hated both the house and village they were moving into far more than the ones they were leaving.

Now that you're packed, free of the crap you don't need to carry around with you, and have enough money for the horrendous process of moving, it's time to move.

However, word of warning:

&gt;people who are genuinely upset that the open gardens were moved from the fourth Sunday of the month to the third

This has nothing to do with living in a village. I've actually met far more of those in cities. What you hate, sadly, is neither village-ness nor city-ness. It's just *people*. You just hate most people. And that's fine. But don't expect to escape them in Bath or anywhere else.

&gt;Where else is good?

Honestly? No-where. I say this sincerely. I've been near enough all over Britain save off the mainland, and the northernmost parts of Scotland (though I've never *lived* in Scotland so who knows maybe it's better there than my short-term impressions suggested). It's all the same. The only significant difference is what the outside looks like, the exact type of materials your house is built out of and on, and the word(s) used to describe a small mostly-spherical lump of bread.

I'm not saying everywhere is absolutely abhorrant. Well, it might be if you hate capitalism or rain or something. But both of those things are inescapable no matter where you go on Earth. But honestly...people are people. Society is society. Money is money. Jobs are jobs. Everything is the same but slightly different.

You can't escape the things you most hate about people or living or society or pointless conversation. Those are inherent in humanity and the system so created. So once you've moved to somewhere better, talk to that therapist I mentioned.

&gt;Are there locations in Britain where flower arrangements and bonfire placement in relation to nearby fields isn't the most pressing issue discussed each day? 

As I think I've already said, effectively no-where. Maybe /r/unitedkingdom or /r/casualuk, but if you're hoping to move into some magical utopia where absolutely no-one cares about random shit that you don't, you're out of luck. It doesn't exist. The vast majority of people do care about that exact random shit that annoys you.

My honest question is this: If you hate what everyone in the village wants to talk about, why do you even talk to them?"

Selling her the dvd on the assumption that the passport was hers is as bad as serving her without asking.

"I don't think there's going to be any one answer for this because it depends on so much. But, I'd recommend having a read up on the legislation on conscription around WWI, WWII and Vietnam to give you an idea how a relatively modern democracy might handle it.

There's no doubt a properly trained, volunteer army can often easily outclasses a larger conscript army (See the Falklands), but sometimes there's just no substitute for having people. Lots of people.

Even within the military, not everything is equal. For example, people like the Paras and Marines and of course Special Forces are pretty much considered ready to rock and roll tomorrow. This isn't really the same for the rest of the military, but again, it depends on context - if you were to deploy to Afghanistan later on in the conflict you'd have received 6 months pre deployment training. That of course can't be afforded to the invasion forces. But even during WWII, a fight for sheer survival, we were putting people through training because trained people are just so so much better on the ground."
"&gt;Do you think the Grenfell burners should be charged?  
  
No.  
  
&gt;Or do you think that by charging them it heavily weakens our ability for ‘free speech’  
  
And, no.  
  
The 'Grenfell burners' (really?!) are a bunch of fucking moronic madlads who thought it would be 'bare jokes' or some other such nonsense to burn an effigy of Grenfell Tower in their back garden.  
The only reason the wider public have been made aware of their little bonfire is because one of the idiots thought it'd be a good idea to upload their fuckery to Facebook/Twitter/Youtube/wherever it originated.  
  
Had this video not been uploaded, none of us would be any the wiser and we'd be busy finding some other pressing social justice issue to get offended by instead.  
These aren't career racists holding a protracted campaign of bigotry and hate. They're a bunch of fannies that likely had a few too many drinks and came up with a fucking terrible idea for a bonfire.
The people featured in the video are ignorant. That's all. They clearly weren't at Grenfell during the blaze, and lack the intellectual or emotional capacity to understand the tragedy of what occurred on the 14th of June last year.  
  
Charging them would be a waste of time and resources, and they would likely learn nothing from punitive measures. Maybe instead of punishing them, they could be asked to sit down with surviving Grenfell victims and the families of the dead to get a better understanding of the gravity of those days events, the human cost and perhaps develop a little bit of empathy for those that have suffered.  
  
  
Should we start charging everybody that burns an effigy of Theresa May/Donald Trump/Phillip Schofield/whoever, for inciting hatred, too?  
  
  
This is nothing but a case of hurt feelings that got out of hand. We should treat it as such.  
  
  
P.S. 'Free speech' is a *massively* misunderstood concept and has absolutely nothing to do with this case, no matter what way you look at it."

I was side swiped by a van whilst I was parked and the guy drove off without stopping, came back to my car and the camera had caught it all as soon as the car moved slightly. Highly recommend getting one and don't forget to get a large SD card for it, if you chose a high quality for the video you'll only get a few hours of footage with the 32GB size. 

Would also recommend getting one that has GPS tracking on it as well as it can save your arse if you need to prove that you, or rather the vehicle, was somewhere else. Shop around on Amazon, I'm using [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B072FVX74Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and don't have any complaints.

Never submitted clips to the police of twats on the road, eventually they'll crash or be caught by a camera/officer. If you need examples of why you should get one though just look at the UK dashcam compilation on YouTube, there have been some occasions where the other drive has lied through their teeth only to be proved wrong by the camera.

But at the end of the day if you have an illness that makes you poo yourself maybe you shouldn't be embarrassed about it. You shouldn't feel ashamed or humiliated for something like that which you have no control over. Human bodies are what they are and the stigma revolving around certain disabilities / illnesses is silly in my opinion. If I had an illness, whilst I wouldn't go on TV anyway, I certainly wouldn't be embarrassed or ashamed if my friends or family knew that I had genuine struggles with it. I would assume my friends and family would have sympathy, empathy and support for me.

I've not seen the show(s) mentioned. Maybe they genuinely want to erase stigma or make talking about these things openly more normal. Or maybe they just want the pay cheque."
