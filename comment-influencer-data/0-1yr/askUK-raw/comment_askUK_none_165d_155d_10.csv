"Quality not quantity. 


Generally most shows stop before they become shit."
"I despise it.  It reeks of genetic determinism.

It comes from a society that is racially polarised, has only recently moved from legally defined racial classes, and in which different races are assumed to have particular innate traits.  

So when someone says ‘I’m always organised, because I’m a quarter german’ or ‘ I like to drink because my family is from irealnd’, they are really saying that they have great characteristics, but you can dismiss some people because of their ancestry because their innate traits are undesirable ( and in case I’ve been too subtle that means blacks, Jews, native Americans, Hispanics..... whatever the race to hate is )."
"Very difficult to get a refund on a pint I've found. In this case I think you just suck it up, then remember to try a bit next time.

Back when I was a student I ordered a pint of Worthingtons from the union bar (I was 18, forgive me). The barmaid filled most of it, then left it on the drip tray so she could go back to top it up once it settled a bit and took the money in the meantime. Standard practice. Another barmaid also wanted to use the Worthingtons tap, so she moved my pint onto the drip tray next to it (Strongbow). My barmaid came back with my change, picked up my pint, topped it up with Strongbow, then gave it to me. I told her what she had done, she refused to believe me. I offered to let her try it but she refused. I pointed out the creamy foam all over the Strongbow nozzle. Nothing to do with her. Finally, a bouncer came over and asked me to leave. Still sore about it now."

"I don't think that's the *reason*, though. We have plenty of shit series (and America has plenty of great ones), but they tend to vanish and be forgotten about quicker. 

British shows tend to have very small writing teams, sometimes even a single writer (leading to 'oh no it's a Steven Moffat episode' moments) whereas American ones are often written almost by committee, leading to more content.

UK shows are written like a novel. American shows are written like a franchise."

"The best thing about this is that if a Scottish person (me) and an English person (any English person will do) were having a slagging about our countries and some American came along and went ""oh yeah I'm part Scottish so fuck you too Mr Englishman"" I'd be teaming up with the Englishman to shut that wee cunt right up."
"Well i despise 'Irish' Americans. They are usually completely ignorant and the worst type of 'Irish' Nationalist. Love to talk about the IRA and hate on Brits (more specifically evil England). My visit to America during St Patricks day deterred me from Americans for life i think. 

Otherwise, i think its rather stupid. Seems like they are just trying to dress themselves up as more exotic than anything else. It's like a boring person who dyes their hair blue."

"A number of factors.

Firstly, who wants to watch the same thing for half a year? Soap fans. This is why so many US sitcoms and dramas end up being bad soaps.

Secondly most UK series are written by a single writer or very small group of writers (rarely more than 3), we don't have a writers room of 20-30 people churning out thousands of pages of script by committee .

Thirdly, commissioning 24 episodes is approximately 4 times as expensive as commissioning 6. There's less money sloshing about in British TV."
"It only really bothers me when they think their Scottish/Irish ""heritage"" gives them the right to shit on English people. That crap is annoying enough from the natives."

Letting agents are the *estate agents* who didn't cut the mustard. Think about how useless the average estate agent is, then imagine someone who failed to get that job."

"I went through a similar situation. People in their 60s and 70s now can spend time on Facebook, news sites, have access to 24 hour news – all stuff that is designed to make people negative and fearful and bitter. It's a feedback loop they can easily get caught up in if they've retired or cut down on work.

I was worn down by it but I got taught a technique by a friend of mine who had a terrible relationship with his parents. What he did was imagine them differently. So rather than you projecting and expecting them to be hateful and negative, look out for the good moments where they have a laugh and are totally fine. Seeing and enjoying these little glimpses of them being 'normal' and lovely really made the times where they *did* get negative into me just rolling my eyes and getting on with my day rather than stewing on it. It's a simple shift but it made me cope with it a bit better.

Saying that, if this is really having an effect on your mental health and you're old enough to do so, then it's *perfectly* acceptable to take a break from them or step away from the situation and keep them at arms length. Think about your own wellbeing."

"American here. Over here 'everyone is from somewhere else' is something we hear all the time (except Native Americans). So, I'll get asked 'what are you?' meaning 'where were your ancestors originally from?'

I always say I'm just American. If they push it, because 'everyone is...' then I'll tell them that over 200 years ago my ancestors were from Germany, but I've never been there and I don't...

They'll cut me off there and say 'Oh, so you're German, then.', as if stating a fact I should be aware of.

No, I'm not fucking German, I'm American and nothing else.

It's weird because the people who pull this stupidity are also usually quite nationalistic--'Murica, and all that nonsense.

"Not a train driver but good experience in the industry.

All new contracts will require anti-social hours, most will have Sundays ""in"" which means you can be rotated 7-days a week (a few have Sundays outside). Most operators do 35-hours for drivers (this is driving hours though, there may be a few extra for admin etc). You get rest breaks etc regularly as well.

It's of course very well paid, the railway is a great industry in terms of colleagues and support. Different operators have different perks but in general you get 75% off all flexible tickets in the country (not tube usually), free travel on your own company, plus some free travel on sister companies. Many also offer discounted travel for family/friends if you are with them. Many operators will also pay for a taxi home if you finish overnight.

They don't discriminate against females (that's illegal!) but they are under-represented in the role so in fact it can work for you. Be aware these roles are hugely competitive - and you will be competing against internal applicants - but I would definitely apply and you will generally learn more as you go through the application process. I remember at Surrey Quays they had over 700 applicants for 1 London Overground driver position and it was only open for about 3 days."

"Sounds like it could be a couple of factors:

* We have a culture of understatement. Boiling hot sun is 'a bit warm' and a life-threatening illness is 'not feeling so good'. Sincere, unmitigated compliments are strange and therefore there is some discomfort from the unfamiliarity. This should ease up as you get closer to someone.
* We have a culture of *appearing* modest with everyone except your very closest friends and family. Although this is beginning to change, it is considered polite to try and play down any compliments you are given. Some people believe that anyone who is openly proud of themselves is showing off or arrogant. There's no cultural script for accepting a big compliment as true.
* We have a strong culture of sarcasm, especially with people we are friendly with. We are much more likely to convey our love by saying 'you fucking idiot' than 'you make my life richer by being close'. So people may be surprised by your words and then get confused checking for sarcasm that isn't there.
* Men in Britain do not get complimented often, as a general rule. So it's unfamiliarity again.
* Italians use louder voices, stronger tones and much closer body language and spacing than British people. This can come across as overly intense, especially if other people are around.
* Because British men aren't used to speaking in the same way as you, they may feel awkward because they are receiving your attentions but don't know how to return them, leaving them feeling that things are unequal and awkward."

"Put simply, you're wrong about those habitats being barren, empty and useless. They're not.

Those ecosystems have indeed been shaped by man, but they've been that way for over five thousand years and support their own diverse ecosystems of native flora and fauna.

For instance, the peak district's heathland and moorland habitats support plants like bilberry, bog asphodel, cottongrass, heather, and sphagnum moss, and animals like the bilberry bumblebee, the common lizard, the green hairstreak butterfly, the golden plover, the mountain hare, the red grouse, the ring ouzel, the short eared owl, and the twite.

Sphagnum moss doesn't sound particularly glamorous, but it's important in the formation of peat. Peat bogs are a *major* carbon sink, taking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than a forest would. Sphagnum moss is also important in the filtration of drinking water. Rainwater falls on the hills, gets filtered through the moss and drains into reservoirs. When the moss gets degraded the water has to undergo more filtration to make it drinkable.

""Rewilding"" a diverse, beautiful and valuable habitat with a young forest would do more harm than good. Ancient woodlands are very biodiverse, but young woodlands aren't and they take centuries to mature to that point."

"It is cultural, but it's not ""British"" culture. It's the estate agent culture.

I don't think /u/Little_Kitty has it right. While it's fun to bash estate agents for being stupid and useless. The problem is deeper than that. At least in my opinion.

In the UK we have a lack of property and an abundance of people looking to rent, especially in student towns/cities.

When someone looks at a property, one lettings agent has that property. If the property is something you want, then you have to use that agent. I've had to give money to lettings agents I didn't want to deal with again, because they had the nice property I wanted to live in.

Combine all of this, and lettings agents do not have to do any work or be useful to people renting a property. They have to appeal to landlords and have properties available. An agent doesn't have to do anything for you, because the next person will come along and do the work to get the house. That means they appear lazy and useless, primarily because working hard and being helpful doesn't get them paid any more/different. This is the ""culture"" you are seeing, useless agents because they have no incentive to be good.

As for help, speak to your university. There is almost certainly an accommodation department or some help available through the students union. These should help get you sorted at the beginning. Get some saved searched on rightmove.co.uk and zoopla.co.uk for properties at the prices/types you want. Filter just for new properties and be ready to call the agent for them immediately."

"Born in '96. 

Music: I was all about Girls Aloud in primary school. Also maybe because of where I grew up (South London), UK Garage music was a big thing. Going into my teenage years it turned into British indie like The Kooks, The Wombats, Rumble Strips, The Pigeon Detectives, Scouting For Girls.

As for TV shows, I remember distinctly watching Skins in secret (from about S3 onwards). The E4 5pm runs of Scrubs and Friends. Lots of CBBC/CITV classics like Raven/My Parents Are Aliens etc.

Chick flicks were a big thing for me; Mean Girls, Wild Child, St Trinian's were all up there

Also, one thing that always stands out to me is the brand Groovy Chick. Every single girl I knew my age had something, if not *swathes* of things by Groovy Chick."

A couple of weeks mainly shadowing other workers and learning about different parts of the business doesn't really benefit the company and I see why they wouldn't want to pay you (unless that forms part of your training for something else). Six months performing a defined set of duties is a job and you should get paid, unless it's a charity etc in which case you might be classed as a volunteer."

Imagine a child who used to be lovely and considerate and friendly, but started playing Fortnite and CoD and is now an angry whiny brat, who constantly curses, insults and belittles others, and is clearly addicted to the games but won't stop playing them even though it's obvious to an outsider that the games aren't making them happy.

If the comparison wasn't blatant enough; Your parents are that child. The video games are The Mail, The Sun, social media and the 24 hr news cycle.

Get rid of the source of the negativity if you can, and replace it with something more positive like hobbies, exercise.

If it was my parents I would probably tell them the changes I have seen and suggest they try to cut back on the social media. Even if they're fully brainwashed that immigrants and benefits scroungers are ruining the country I'm sure they could see that spending all the time on these topics isn't bringing them happiness.

"We call it a series, not a season. I’m not saying that to be a dick about American English, I promise! More that it speaks to another difference in our programming.
