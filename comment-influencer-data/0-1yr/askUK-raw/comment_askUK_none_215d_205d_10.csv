"[diabetes.org.uk](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/complications/hypos/having-a-hypo) suggests jelly babies - seems to fit the ticket!

My uncle (T1 diabetic) used to drink Lucozade (the orange Energy one, not the Sport one) as it had 17g/100mL; however, now it only has 8.9g/100mL thanks to the sugar tax."
"Lad culture (also laddish culture and laddism) is a British subculture initially associated with the Britpop movement. Arising in the early 1990s, the image of the ""lad"" – or ""new lad"" – was that of a generally middle class figure espousing attitudes typically attributed to the working classes. The subculture involves young men assuming an anti-intellectual position, shunning sensitivity in favour of drinking, violence, and sexism

"The old firehouse. It's just off the highstreet, past John Lewis. Lovely pub in a cool old building, good cheap food and amazing pizza (only served in the evenings sadly). Also easy to get to from central station via a footpath that takes you pretty much directly there if needed.

"Tennis jumper. 

Not even tennis players wear these. Just posh people. "
A knob usually.
"sysadmin - work from home 4/5 days,  sometimes I have a crafty doobie. nuff said."
Egg fried rice with a bit of bacon and lots of chillies is my go to at the moment. 
"No, they have such a cultural cachet and are so irregular that the vast majority of wearers are posh, people who just want to be posh would be utterly ridiculed for wearing them.

They’re certainly ostentatious, and many of the wearers are probably trying to advertise that they’re posh, but contrary to the strongly-held lower-middle class belief, some genuinely posh people do want to show off."
"Hah, banta"
Slightly worn tweed.
Enormous bowl of muesli with soya milk. It's probably not 100% healthy but it keeps me off the Twixes for a few hours.
"A ‘lad’ is usually a young, typically white man around the ages of 15-25. Usually flunked school, loves drinking and socialising, often engages in antisocial behaviour and waves away criticism of it as ‘just banter’. Often has an interest in ‘casual’ fashion like Stone Island. Lomg story short, they’re immature self-absorbed twats who no one with two brain cells to rub together would go near."
"Mashed banana with two Weetabix and semi-skimmed milk. Basically toddler food, but delicious and filling."
"Half and half Greek yogurt and cottage cheese, with a handful of grapes and a little maple syrup. Nothing else I've tried - that's anything like as simple - comes close to lasting like that."
Typepyedong? Is good. There's some good burgers next door too. Although it's been a while so they might be shut
"Putting a teaspoon of chia / flax seeds in it properly bumps up the calories, fibre and nutrition as well without changing the taste or texture. 

I also like to mix up a heaped tablespoon of peanut butter in it as well. Filling, fairly nutritious and not as boring as *just* porridge. 

Or mix up some cocoa powder and banana with oats and milk and stick it in the fridge before you go to bed and they're ready to eat in the morning straight out the fridge. "
"Hometown in the NE  can pay 30 quid pp and get a half decent room with breakfast included if you spend more than 5 minutes googling. 

Currently in Berkshire where you'd need a small mortgage just to rent a cupboard for 30 mins"
"Reality TV mate, they have to be pricks.

"
"I buy video games from Japan fairly often and when they get stopped by royal mail it's 20% vat and an £8 handling fee. Iirc parcel farce have a higher fee but I've not had anything from them for a long time. From what I remember it was £16.

What I tend to do now is if I want a lot of games I'll split the order down into multiple lower value ones and pay a little more on postage but save overall by not having to pay extra fees when they get to the UK"
"It’s used in various contexts. It could either mean a) a boy or boys (e.g “the lads from down the road”) or b) a twat who usually acts really misogynistic and rude all the time c) a person who has a lot of casual sex, like a “stud” or a “player”"
"It is majorly automated, there are sensors at the side of the road which use radar to clock passing traffic and induction loops in the tarmac which do the same and detect slow down or stopped traffic. There are a lot of cameras on the road so Highways England control can also manually override the system if they see something or get a call and close a lane reactively"
Never seen a member of the working class sporting a gilet
"In theory, yes.

In practice, no."
"When we were sorting out hotels for our wedding we found it started at £80 for a decent room for the night. That was for a summer Saturday. 

I live in Cheltenham and the races puts hotels up to obscene prices though. Out of curiosity I checked prices for next month’s meeting. A room on Thursday at the Holiday Inn will set you back £438. It’s crazy but I guess people must get desperate and pay it. "
White tie or morning suit.
"Nice ... never come across these so far in my life, but I lived in reach of a city wide sewer systems for a long time."
"Name and shame, I don't want to give them my money "
"Not many places will take you on before you turn 16, when I was 15 I did a paper round which gave me a bit of spending money every so often. Go to your local newsagents or ring the number for any leaflets you get through your door and ask them if they need paperboys/girls in the area. 
Write up a really good CV, include work-efficient personality traits and passion for charity work, everything that makes you sound better than you are. You have to really sell yourself.
Also, if you can help it, avoid talking about school and your achievements at school on your CV. The less you sound like a secondary school student, the more likely you are to be given an interview."
You get loads of support as a mental health HCA to help you through difficult shifts/experiences etc. You learn ways of dealing with the stress so donn't let that put you off applying. Check NHS Jobs or ring your local inpatient unit (ask for a matron or ward manager) and see if they're recruiting bank staff.
Hehe
"Nope, Canada went to the 5/0 range and works great."
"Most stores will take them, supermarkets especially so. You only really get an issue in like corner shops, just small stores and places that people try to scam a lot like takeaways.  

Used to live in Milton Keynes and worked retail/customer service there for like a decade, literally everywhere I worked accepted them, apart from one place that stopped for a month because of a spate of fakes. "
"I did my degree after college, however, my career went into the direction of Software Development so I did a MSc in Computer Science. I did this part time out of office hours and it was a real struggle handling work, travel and my course. However, I knew it wasn't going to be like that forever and I pushed through it and came out with a Distinction. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm proud of it and I loved doing it. You can go straight into a masters degree with some universities and they give you several introduction modules which would half the time that it would take but I'm not sure if that applies to Mathematics. "
Can you make anything _not_ fresh?
"Oh my bad, Pluggers are also called thongs or ""flip flops"" haha

Okay cool! I've never experienced snow before, so I'm a tad sketched out at whether just a hoodie and jeans will cut it 

thanks!"

I usually get things like that as refurbed from business sellers on ebay
It's illegal in the majority of cases
"Yeh i would imagine so. 

Im just a student so im not in the know on the monetary cost we receive from product getting stolen. 

There is a lot more stealing than you would imagine."
"Where are you ordering from? Do they do click and collect to e.g. a CollectPlus shop, or a Hermes shop?"
"Hmm I've heard of my  colleagues talk about the book, never read it myself but went to one of his shows recently where he does this performance of himself reading excerpts from them. 

He just seems like he's just doing a good job pandering to those that put the NHS on a pedestal. Real cringeworthy sentimental stuff that will probably help him sell more books and make more money. 

Just my 2c as a junior Dr of 3 years that actually worked in the exact same trust he did. "
"Very few, if any, doctors work shifts like that, unless it's a locum that gets paid £50/hr or something silly like that. "
"In basic terms, the money is there to help with costs assossiated with your disability. If there aren't any costs, why would you need the money.

I speak from being someone who went to university with both anxiety and depression. I had to go to hospital because of it"
"Well sure, that's extra hot. As opposed to extra hot, which is something entirely different. "
"VB is basically splats in a tinnie.    
Vegemite is about yes, it goes through phases. Sometimes it is everywhere the rest it is rarer than, well, [insert some witty phrase]"
"They'll still be making money from you on that. Lot of the time because they're an affiliate, still worth having though!  "
You don't have a work address or know someone else in Brighton who can receive it? 
Savoury.
"In the first couple of series the cast wore special helmets with mini-cameras positioned just in front of their noses, eventually they realised they could just use normal cameras most of the time the time to get the same effect without the wobbliness and with better picture quality."
Thank you for your service ma'am and god bless 
"Mmm I disagree, he may or may not be passionate about the NHS but I almost guarantee he hams things up to sell more books. "
Thanks. My friend over here was having a little trouble. He's so dumb!
If ya preferred fucking about with the cameras and the editing shit to writing the coursework consider learning a trade.
"A proper butcher's knife is kept so sharp that if you cut the end of your finger off like a berk, it doesn't hurt until you look at it."
"I'm ordering directly from acer, and they dont offer much in terms of shipping options."
"I've had to do the door to door charity grind in the past. Street fundraising as well. Not quite as harsh with pay, the company I worked for, but there's not much that makes it easy to be told to fuck off a hundred times a day."
ATC?
"I have a jazz and am very happy with it. It's super practical, so much space inside yet small on the outside. It's great having a really short bonnet, makes parking so much easier.

I think driving an estate would be really awkward, especially when parking in car parks - some places have barely enough distance between rows and if a long or badly parked vehicle sticks out it in an adjacent space can be very difficult to turn"
"And weirdly, as I found out recently, seems to have higher medical standards than a Class 1 pilot."
Can confirm it's cracking 
A person. 
Asking the important questions!
I've only been on one date in my life when I was 15 and it was just a trip to the cinema. Not much to tell but I guess it was my best and worst by default. 
"Ah i used to work for the Sainsbury's UK call center in Newry, Northern Ireland. I honestly love Sainsbury's as a company, but the pickers in a select amount of stores where taking the piss daily. 

... And for customers who called up complaining about their shops from these stores, I'd immediately go straight to management to sort it out. Including putting a 0% rating for the online department. I got to know a few managers on first name basis. 

The drivers though for Sainsbury's were saints and still today the company providing telephone only orders is a life saver for 1000s of OAP'S! 

when working there, most nights I'd have a story for the pub about an amazingly stupid substitution! 😂"
"it's because they literally don't have any stovetops or any way to boil water in a pan. 99% of all the food is microwaved, apart from the fried fish, bacon and sausages (I believe) and chips "
I think Waterstones has a Kobo on display. At least in my one. Also Tesco has some Kindle at their electrical section.
"I really like British Boxers, in particular the [stretch trunks](https://british-boxers.com/collections/stretch-trunks). I've just never come across anything as comfortable. They're great quality (I've got pairs that are several years old that are like new), lovely soft fabric, and keep everything in the right place. The only time I wear others now is if I'm lazy about washing.

They aren't cheap, but they do a random 'lucky dip' four pack if you don't mind getting at least one or two of the more garish colours (I'm convinced they do the lucky dip packs to offload the pink ones)."
"&gt;  I live in the middle of a small town with tight windy roads so I'd find the extra (unneeded) space a hinderance.

Ah, good point. Never considered that."
I had this issue with fucking Talk Talk. I only got anywhere with them after blasting them on social media (their own page for all customers to see). 
Definitely these. Didn't like the bamboo ones but I think that a cos I washed them at too warm a temperature and they shrunk. The synthetics were great last summer with the heat and bloody handy when you need a pee.

"&gt; It isn't as simple as pressing the go/stop button and then putting your feet up.

We're already past the point of full automation and the driver is there just to keep the public happy. On the Tube the driver literally presses the stop/go button."
"&gt; keep meatballs overnight (after they are cooked in the factory, then reheated and kept warm for 4 [often up to 6] hours) and reheat them in the morning

Ah makes sense why I heard so many stories about people getting sick from having meatball subs."
"I doubt that they broke anything on purpose, and I doubt even more that they stole some bloody CDs."
I had an interview for a company like this. On the job interview walking around nabourhoods. Walked away after a few hours when the penny finally dropped. The job was advertised as a creative marketing executive. Bs to that!
so does that count as wi fi speed then? im pretty sure the isp i work for is doing the same thing
"curses, I always customise my burgers because I don't like some of the normal stuff in them (and love extra bacon, cheese and onion) "
Do you apologise to the bus when you do?
"I’m just over 5ft, so I definitely can’t relate to this. "
Of course! And the bus driver when I'm walking on the bus 
"&gt;Especially those which are likely to be isolated or won’t have any people about. Thanks!

..you are not planning an invasion are you?"
The blokes not even a judge so it's no off to a great start from an authenticity point of view.
"You've self certified. You don't need to do any more than that.  
  
To be honest, explaining why you went home would likely be in your detriment. As you said, you're still on probation. A Manager likely won't be too enamoured with a member of staff that's potentially going to leave without notice on a regular basis to have a 'mental health day', regardless of how justified it might seem."
Visited my sister in london a few months back and she says to always get off on the middle-of-the-bus doors. Dunno if yours have them but that might work. If they don't you could try smashing and jumping out the emergency window
"I’ll need to be sponsored for the tier 2 visa, which is also why I’m considering school as an option for getting over there. Currently my job is on the job shortage list in the UK, but that doesn’t seem to be making much of a difference when it comes to companies wanting to hire."
"Why would someone be interested in constantly spending money all year round on absolute strangers?

I get it's appeal at Christmas, it's once a year.

But all year round? Why?"
"They can't make you do anything, although the easiest thing if a security guard asks to search you is to quickly show the receipt / bag and be on your way. Who knows why they stopped you, could have mistaken you for someone else or thought you put the stuff in your bag without paying. Or just being a prick. If is of course your duty to be a complete prick back to them and make life difficult if they do this kind of thing. "
Germany bombed a bit but it was mostly the Glasgow City Council in the 60s who destroyed as much as they could so they could build the worst buildings imaginable.
I assume they mean when getting off the bus and turning right. The mirror can be quite low.
"I normally hate to be petty, but this is the time to break out the green pen for the Google review"
"The team I’m in all seem like genuine people, and I know that doesn’t necessarily mean that some of them aren’t nasty buggers but it’s a small company and everyone kinda needs to get on. Everyone here seems level headed, can have a laugh, and generally seem somewhat relaxed (for example the odd swear word that’s let out doesn’t phase anyone, which I for some reason thought would be different having come from civil service into private).

Thank you for the advice here, I’m happy talking about it all and I genuinely am fine now. I feel I’m edging more toward telling them certain details, though I will still worry about the probation part until I get through it.."
So Tim won't stock French booze but he will ship his poached eggs from them. 
Hahahaha fml
on the other hand.... you don't show the judge your dick unless you *want* to be thrown in jail
Bus wanker
"&gt; Mechanic said that's only going to happen if whoever had the wheel of last tightened them up way, way too tight.

This is one of the most annoying things about garages. SO MANY of them use impact tools to put on the lug nuts and it's completely unnecessary and massively inconvenient."
We have security stickers on our bedding to deter people opening up all the packets
Are you a budgie? 
Ask HR who deals with it if not them. They need to advise you.
I'm fine with convenience foods but there's something so horrible sounding about pre packed poached eggs. Do they taste good?
I have the yearly one and it’s £10.40 a month by Direct Debit. 
Probably the only way I'd ever lose my virginity
"Having worked at a major car factory I can tell you that your ""brand new"" car could have sat outside for 2 years getting mouldy then just had a new registration. 

We found mice nesting in the engines fairly regularly."
"Your only option is to get off at the stop after where you actually want to get off, that way you're walking towards the rear of the bus when you alight. Hope this helps :)"
Yes.
"i work in retentions aswell. i also have my tv  with sky so i play the game look i do your job best deal or i cancel pal

"None. Honestly, the toxicity around England and the low frequency of meaningful games means I have am indifferent to the national team except for one or two knockout games every two years. I've not watched a qualifier in at least five years and even the group stages at tournaments aren't must see TV. 

Perhaps it's helped by the fact that I'm half Scottish, so I consider myself more of a supporter of that team than England, despite being born south of the border. At least with Scotland there's the excitement of finding out how we won't qualify for the tournament each year. "
Nonsense.
"I tend to go for the stretch hipster type ones, have had a batch from Tesco which didn't last long, some Calvins which lasted years (expensive though), and Oddballs which are great and a good cause too. "
"I know someone who used to work in production on Judge Rinder. The answer is - it depends on what you mean by 'staged'.  I wouldn't say it's accurate to call it 'completely staged' because that implies that everything about it is fake. 

As has already been said, it's (obviously) not a real court. Rinder is also (again obviously) not a real judge. Rinder acts as an arbiter and the people who appear agree to abide by his decision. As has also already been said, the show pays out for any judgement made. This is mostly because nobody would agree to appear if they could both lose money and look stupid on TV at the same time. 

On the other hand, the people who appear on it are 'real people', not actors. They don't have a script to read from and will genuinely have some kind of grievance with each other. Of course, the production staff will pick the most interesting and unusual cases and people to appear because that makes for better TV. But the cases aren't fabricated - just a deliberately picked handful of the strangest and most interesting ones. "
"I suspect if you asked for a dropped kerb, this would all form part of it. There is a possibility of course the bus stop hasn't been used for a while, but they could want it to form part of future bus routes or have that option. Rather like those train stations which are never used and get 20 passengers a year, but have still been sat there for 20 years. "
"A friend used to have a white Sierra estate, christened Ecto 1 by the rest of us. "
