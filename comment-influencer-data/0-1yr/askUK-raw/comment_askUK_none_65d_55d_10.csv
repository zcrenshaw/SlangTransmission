"&gt;It's for a marketing job paying 22k (London).  
&gt;  
&gt;The current team is one person  
&gt;  
&gt;Another marketing person just left.

This, along with what sounds like a dreadful phone manner, are all red flags.

Avoid and go and find something else."
"£21k, in London.

Fuck that."
"Open at night, when it's cooler outside.

Closed during the day, and curtains closed as well if the sun hits those windows."
I am a Scottish person and I wholeheartedly agree with OP. People would rather be on top of a pile of dung than half way up a mountain. There is no economic or moral case for independence and i'm sick of the constant rattle for referendums.
"The issue is that nobody in Scotland see's themself as just another constituency. We (rightfully) see ourself as a country and England/Wales/Northern Ireland as a seperate countries.

Four countries joined together and ruled under one government. Since England is by far the largest population, they essentially choose the government (which is fair).

The issue is that the politics of Scotland and England are completely different. We vote opposite on just about everything. But England is bigger, so what they vote for is what we get.

It is incredibly disheartening to see Brexit, the NHS dying, Boris becoming our new leader, and all of that bad stuff knowing that we voted against it all and it's only happening because of England.

We are just two very different countries who want our countries to be ruled in very different ways. Independence is the only way to get that, even if it will bring difficulties with it.

We just want to break free of England and start ruling and building our country the way we want to. A progressive, European country. A lot different than England and the UK."
"&gt; From a non-Scottish perspective you seem to have a great deal economically. Free university, subsidised care homes, more reasonable house prices, free prescriptions.

Scotland does have free university and free prescriptions. But it has those because it has voted for Governments that chose to spend money on those things.

That Scotland has chosen to fund those projects does not prevent you, as a voter elsewhere in the UK, from voting for parties that do the same.

&gt; All this and more leading to a deficit 6% higher than the rest of the uk.

The Scottish Government had no ability to run a deficit [until the Scotland Act 2012](https://www.gov.scot/publications/foi-17-02702/).

The first time that this power was used was 2017 for a total for £450m. Beyond that the Scottish Government budget is set by the UK Government, as a proportion of UK Government spending.

The choices you are decrying above are exactly that - choices made by the Scottish Government.

For better or for worse, the UK Government has chosen to spend differently.

&gt; Yes Scotland has higher poverty rates but clearly the UK is spending on their development so it’s not due to neglect from central government? This may well be worse without a support network.

By way of counter-example, consider how the UK Government chose to distribute [EU Agricultural Funding](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41749242).

This was awarded to the UK on the basis that Scotland's farming required it, yet the UK Government chose to spend 85% of that funding outside of Scotland:

&gt;The Scottish government contends that England, Wales and Northern Ireland were all above the qualifying threshold of 90% of the EU average, but Scotland sitting at 45% meant the UK was eligible for a £190m ""convergence uplift"" in funding.
&gt;
&gt;Ministers say it was clear that that the extra cash was intended for Scottish farmers, but the Treasury chose to distribute the funds across the UK with only about £30m coming north of the border.

Scotland's poverty rates, and indeed other socioeconomic issues, are the outcome of being part of the UK.

We spend £3bn a year on dealing with the effects of alcohol abuse, the same as England &amp; Wales despite having 1/10th the population, yet the Scottish Government has no power to use taxation on alcohol to tackle that problem.

The Home Office refuse to provide evidence to the recent drug use inquiry, and are [actively opposed to any attempt to tackle it](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/home-office-minister-refused-to-give-evidence-in-scottish-drug-use-inquiry-1-4952433).


&gt; If Scotland became independent not only would they lose the above

You are claiming that Scotland simply couldn't afford to survive without the UK.

&gt; they would also lose: most of their military, their currency, the NHS (wouldn’t help the already reduced life expectancy), and the vast majority of political power.

On the military, Scotland has no military to lose. However it has funded around 10% of the UK's military assets so the UK would expect to lose that 10% (or to trade it off for some equivalent).

On currency, the Scottish Government are not going to propose a currency sharing arrangement again. A Scottish Pound, pegged to Sterling for a short period, is now the likely outcome.

On the NHS, NHS Scotland is already an entirely separate entity. I am surprised that as a British person you're not aware of that.

On ""political power"", I think we'll be fine. I'm quite looking forward to being a normal small country in Western Europe.

&gt; I’m sure there are many things I’ve missed below the surface. Scotland could develop these but it would be expensive and incredibly hard- why bother?

For many people the question is not ""why should Scotland be independent?"", but ""why shouldn't Scotland be independent?"".

Independence is the natural state of affairs for countries.

&gt;Often you hear people say they don’t feel represented. Neither does anyone.

Then they should vote for a party with a policy of reforming the voting system. Perhaps the SNP?

&gt; If you remove the arbitrary border Scotland is just like any other constituency. I didn’t want you know what major recent political event (cba to message mods) or even a conservative local representative but it happened to me regardless - doesn’t mean I’m gonna declare myself an independent state. London feels nothing like my home county either.

Scotland is a country, not a region (let alone a constituency).

The movement for Scottish Home Rule has existed for over a century now. Indeed, the first legislation for the Scottish Parliament [was in 1913](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29048884).

Your perspective is that Scotland is simply an electoral constituency within the UK. As such it is as integral as somewhere like Kent.

However, for many people in Scotland, Scotland is a country. The UK is union that Scotland - voluntarily - participates in.

&gt; It’s been over 400 years since our unification and through that time Scotland has been part of the core of one of the most powerful nations in the world. The UK is not what it once was but I can’t see how leaving would be anything but detrimental for Scotland.

The feeling that ""the UK is not what it once was"" is, in fact, the attitude that many in Scotland would like to get away from.

Independence for Scotland is about opportunity - the opportunity to make different choices from the rest of the UK. Some of those choices may well take effort, and some may prove to be mistakes.

But, simply speaking, they will be Scotland's mistakes to make.

&gt;It would be far harder to celebrate and continue their culture if they had to develop all the systems currently on a uk basis while avoiding worsening poverty, security, growth, and healthcare.

And yet, continuing to participate in the UK is likely to lead to a worsening on all those fronts.

If your mindset is that Scotland is creating every aspect of a new country from scratch then I can understand why you would think it a significant obstacle.

However Scotland has been taking political and economic steps towards independence for over 20 years now, and many of the core institutions (healthcare, police, fire service, the legal system, the educational system, etc) have been distinct from the rUK equivalents for hundreds of years."
"Nottinghamshire has the only village left which practices medieval strip farming on unenclosed land (Laxton), has more football European Cup wins than France, and has its cultural landmarks like mushy peas and Robin Hood constantly appropriated by Yorkshire.

"Wiltshire has Stonehenge, Avebury and Salisbury. We’re far enough into the Westcountry that we don’t have many Home Counties chinos and polo shirt type golf club douches, but we’re not so far in that we’re total cider drinking yokels (our ciderhead yokel percentage is at a healthy 50%) 

We’ve got lovely picturesque villages, spooky woodlands, rolling valleys, white horses carved on hillsides, Roman hill forts and the Kennet and Avon canal. People are generally laid back and friendly. Even our more affordable towns are still relatively nice. 

Downsides: people from London will buy houses in your village, visit twice a year to be obnoxious in the pubs and then air bnb them the rest of the time. There’s terrible public transport so you need a car. Everyone knows everybody else’s business. There’s generally only one local school and one nearby hospital, so you get what you’re given."

"In England you have your traditional 'Top 4' which are Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Tesco is the clear marker leader with over 30% market share middle in terms of quality and price.

Asda and Sainsburys trade second place regularly with 15% share . Asda pride themselves on being for families and the cheap option, and are therefore seen as low quality 

Sainsburys are the opposite and seen as relatively high quality for a standard supermarket 

Poor old Morrisons just exist have about 10%

A few years ago the German Discounters Aldi and Lidl appeared on the scene. Their arrival coinciding with a period of economic uncertainty and austerity meaning people were quite happy to shop there. The quality is decent at a price below what Asda would/could offer as a result of the strains Walmart put on Asda.

At the other end of the scale premium retail grew with Waitrose and Booths. Essentially the market happy to pay foe true premium or value and everything in the middle gets squeezed

Tesco went through a period of being the whipping boys but are in a strong place now. Quality and price perception up. They also now own Booker and One Stop and have a huge wholesale proposition to diversify.

Discounters flying and gaining market share each year though most or this is from opening new stores. Pretty soon they will hit a wall where their distribution costs rise and they struggle to maintain low prices and profit.

Asda are suffering from Tesco improving and discounters growing, therefore chipped away from both ends.

Sainsbury's proposition being chipped away by true premium retail in Waitrose and Ocado - which is essentially why Asda and Sainsbury's tried to merge (and failed)

Morrisons still sorta just exist but have stopped trying to compete and just doing their own thing pretty well. They also have a decent wholesale proposition with Mccolls.

Just for bants there's also a shitload of high street discounters (Poundland (Dealz), Home Bargains, Farmfoods, Heron, B&amp;M also muscling in and putting even more pressure on the traditional top 4.

Longstory short: it's a good time to be a consumer."

"That is what I was getting at with my first sentence. Nobody in Scotland sees Scotland as a county like that. We think of ourself as a country, and a country seceding from a union of countries is different than a county seceding from a country.

"I understand your point, but you're either in a situation, or looking at this from a situation whereby the person who is working *enjoys* their work and is able to see the difference it makes. A good example is probably a doctor. Long, stressful hours, but you're fairly well compensated and are making an objectively positive impact on the world.

Unfortunately, most people dont enjoy their work and either cant or dont care about its effect on the world. They want to work for themselves, their families and have a good life. Working in a call centre endlessly, no matter how pleasant the call centre is nowhere near as beneficial to someone's well being as taking the time to do the things that they enjoy.

And to preempt your reply, no people cant always change jobs to what they would love to do. Sadly there can only be so many ""worthwhile"" jobs, and unfortunately they tend not to pay as well as the crappy jobs which offer a good quality of life. 

What a lot of people do instead of working a rubbish job for the ""betterment of society"" (as you imply - I would say this is an extremely capitalist/American viewpoint and what ""society"" means there is business owners), is to spend their free time on hobbies that interest them as well as holidays and their family. Whether volunteering, setting up or joining clubs, exercise, model making, or whatever. These things do make a difference in the world to some small degree and are often removed from the world of work for the person who is doing them.

I admire your viewpoint, but most people are unable to have it due to personal circumstance (E.G., they have children) or, they just dont care about the work they do. 

Personally, whilst I hope to enjoy what I do, I will always see work as a means to an end of enjoying my life."

Look around ""normal"" areas and you will see a poor level of infrastructure, even just roads are widely acknowledged to be in a shit state compared to the north. Everyone I've met from Dublin who has been to Belfast has commented on how much more liveable it is than they expected, how few homeless we have and so on. Our education system is streets ahead (and we don't have the nonsense of a transition year), apart from, you know, the segregation.. As a region rather than a country, we benefit hugely from a different economic focus, not needing to balance in a way a nation does, and we also benefit big time from UK public sector employment, which meant we didn't experience the highs of the Celtic Tiger years, but we also didn't experience the lows of 2008. Our economy is ironically much more stable.

"What an arrogant, and at this stage entirely expected, response.

Scotland has zero voice in the Union, and at best is treated as an after afterthought by Westminster, and Middle England.

Look at the utter farce that is English politics; how can anyone with a straight face say we are better off as a nation being run by these utter cretins.

England lied to us during the referendum about staying in the EU, and is dragging us out regardless of our wishes.  It’s just disgusting that anyone would think we should shut up and know our place while the English fuck things up."
re: sandbags - make sure you put one in the downstairs loo too to stop sewage backing up from the sewage system into your house.
"It's because of miners. The Cornish were among the best miners and engineers in the world. So we found ourselves spread across the world and taking our food with us this is also why you'll find people in mining areas of the world with surnames beginning with Tre, Pol or Pen. There is a town in Mexico which sells pasties because of miners going there. Because of the spread of Cornish miners there is the phrase ""look down any hole and you'll find a Cornishman""."
I'm looking forward to an independent Scotland.
"Meetup.com    
But beforehand stop it with the ""I don't"" jive and be more 'I have not tried yet'."
"If that's what they're willing to say while they're trying to court you, imagine what they'll be like if they hire you.

Mate, I've worked in a place like this. It fucking sucked. Give it a miss, there's better places out there."
"Ahh yes, evil Europe/UK and their rights for employees."
"I think first the things first is to get diagnosed so you have an explanation for your condition. Possibly ASD, possibly something else.    
As for temperature, we all suffer."
"He's a self-serving, duplicitous bumblefuck who is just as happy to throw someone under a bus as he is putting a lie on the side of one.

An utter disaster."
A bong.
World's worst airport
It's the only place in the UK with a permanent copy of the European cup on display. Also we have salt and pepper chips and chicken which is amazing
"An Aquascutum Trench Coat.

I was looking for a smart coat to wear with a black suit for a funeral up in Scotland. Tried it on in the shop, it fitted, paid them £4.50.

It was only when I got it home I realised it was worth about £700 new!"
Except that Highland is twice as big
"His party cut all the police officers though.

Crime isn't just getting worse in London."
"Where abouts in Cornwall? I'm from Newquay but have been travelling Australia for the last 16 months. I was shocked too find in Bondi, Sydney there is a pasty shop where the man's great grandfather came out from Cornwall and has taught the true pasty making down the line too current day where he now runs a shop selling them. Cousin Jack's Pasty Co is the name of the place."
"You should do something then, Liz...."
"Interesting that during the furore over Trump telling congress women to ""go home"" it seems to have been forgotten that Tories were shouting this at SNP MPs in the house just a few months ago."
"&gt; Scotland, as an entity, has a massively louder voice in the union than England, because it is represented by its own devolved parliament.

No, it has a loud voice in Scotland trough its devolved parliament.  In the Union, Scotland is an afterthought.  A bunch of whinging Scots as the new English PM calls us.

&gt;Individual Scottish citizens have exactly the same voice as everyone else in the UK - you elect your representatives at Westminster just like I do.

Which is why Scotland has never voted in a Tory government, but we've had one for most of the last 50 years.

&gt;English politics is not a farce at all, because English politics is not a thing. British politics is a farce.

Again, Scotland did not vote in this shower of inbreds; it is the English that do this.  Scotland has no possibility of changing this, dooming us to the whim of Middle England.  You can pretend we're all just British, but that simply is not the case.

&gt;England did not lie to Scotland about anything. Tory and Labour MPs (including Scottish MPs) lied to all of us.

'The Pledge'.  Utter lies and bullshit from Tory cunts.  All voted in and held in power by the English."
Then they should pay staff like they work at Google. Sounds like delusional managers
"I'm a Scottish unionist or as we are known to facebook commenters a ""yoon"" I agree.

But the reason is basically, self determination and if ""we"" are going to fuck things up at least ""we"" did it not big bad Westminster."
"That's that #RiseAndGrind bullshit for you. Startups seem not to understand that with all the downsides, there should surely be an upside if they want people to apply. Apparently people still line up."
"&gt; It's been over 400 years since our unification 

You mean 300.

Before that, England and Scotland were two countries sharing  the same monarch."
It is my reality.
"Depends on the difference in temperature, if its colder outside open them up, doors too, if its warmer outside batten down the hatches."
"Matlock Bath is the seaside town. Matlock is ennui in the hills.

Surely Derbyshire is more famous for the Peak District, though? Or Chesterfield and the Crooked Spire, or Derbyshire and the ""massage parlour"" opposite the train station?"
"&gt; Nothing there seems to fit me    
    
Tbf, that is your attitude. Meetup is called Meetup because it is people meeting up. The reason has varying levels of importance so turn and meet people.    
You don't have to be a card-carrying Dungeons and Dragons 78th level wizard, you just have to be a person who wants to meetup with people."
"&gt; Tesco and Asda - working class who are careful with their money

Tesco is for the lower middle class who think they're better than ASDA but can't afford to shop at Sainsbury's."
"I had a friend earning 19k in London, no idea how she even survived."
"People can afford houses in Northamptonshire, that makes us stand out!"
"Knife to cut the cake, without a doubt the wankiest charge. £50 to borrow a “silver” knife. It wasn’t even fancy, just a bloody cake knife. You can buy wedding ones for a tenner, no ones going to take any notice of a bleeding knife on the day. So saved ourselves £40 and now have a random cake knife.

Oh also check fine details, I went to a wedding where they opted for lit tea lights in the garden, £150. Literally had 10 tea lights and the holders were the good old Ikea ones, they didn’t even get to keep them. They were not impressed. 

Edit: tea light guff added."
"Well he'll quit the EU and trade with the USA. So expect less stringent food controls as we'll probably end up eating American chicken.  
I don't want to quit the EU but that's a personal opinion. Scotland will vote for independence and win. Then things will get messy."
"No. The office has air con so it's not too bad in the day, but sleeping is just impossible. I'm going to buy an air conditioner. That, or move to Caithness."
If you were just there a short time and have an otherwise consistent work history then i'd leave it off your CV entirely.
"Bedfordshire. Not much going on ever. Close to London so lots of commuters makes train travel a nightmare during peak hours. Luton (boooo). Bedford is very ethnically diverse, some of the best Italian and Asian food I've had."
"You forget to mention that Scotland never wanted to be part of the United Kingdom. We were bombarded and taken over by the English. 

Jesus. We are Scottish. We do know how to function as human beings by the way. We also know how to run a country pretty well. The way we are treated is shocking. We aren’t a nation of a bunch of babbling buffoons. The only buffoon here is the one who’s just about to be PM. 

Find some non biased sources and get to reading. You’ll realise that Scotland has been taken for a merry ride up the Clyde for years by Westminster. 

I’m sure when you see the real facts and figures you’ll be astonished at just how much Scotland exports and just how little we get back due to Westminster."
"Thanks for the link.

""founded by capricious narcissists""

That's the impression I got of this one."
