"I’m glad this is the top post.

Curry is amazing and indeed you were talking to a twat"
"Honestly, be wary of this person.  They are lying to you and seem quite hostile towards foreigners, possibly to the point of racism.

To say Brits don’t eat curry, and that only immigrants do, may seem funny and somewhat harmless.  But its fundamentally untrue, and you have to question why someone would attempt to distort reality this way.

The comments about UKIP are most damning.  They are a party of racists and thugs."
"You forgot ""racist"" before twat"
A real bellend.
"Right plonker, mate."
Just asked him and he said UKIP isn’t perfect but it’s “the least shitty”
I'm going to go so far as to say that OP had the misfortune of addressing an absolute fuckwit.
Plus it's pretty popular to currys like cook tikka massala at home
A proper flannel.
"Live in a small village that used to have 3 pubs. One of them closed down a couple years back and is now a curry house, it's a perfect storm"
I think you words some mixed up
An ambling cockwomble.
Alright yoda
An absolute wank stain
I'd bet fifty quid that anyone claiming no one eats curry (when they do) and it's not really a British food (when it actually is) and it's a ploy to make us seem multicultural when we aren't (when we actually are) is racist.
"Yep, idiot confirmed. UKIP are lunatic fringe xenophobes.  

Curry is one of the most popular takeaway dishes in the UK."
"Very likely a racist. What they said isn't racist, but I can only imagine a racist saying it. Definitely a Twat."
Imagine thinking that liking curry is a symptom of PC gone mad
I've only just had my morning coffee!

"He’d have to be blind to the songs, constant presence on TV, Indians on every street corner and the actual experience of eating out to be actually ignorant that Indians are popular in the UK."
"Top trolling. What else did your ""mate"" tell you?

Thatcher is the most popular prime minister in the UK?

British people don't really like dogs?

British people are the best linguists in Europe?"
"I reckon he was talking to that lad who went blind because all he ate was chips, pringles and white bread, with the occasional slice of ham or a sausage."
"Oh he sees them, he just doesn't like them.  He's being subtly racist by trying to paint them as something people like him don't like, and he's assuming that most of the country is like him.

Edit: and by 'the country' he means 'the people he thinks should be in the country'.

Edit 2: He isn't being subtle; he's just trying to be.  We can see that it's racist but he possibly doesn't; either because he's just ignorant and really doesn't realize the path he's going down, or because he doesn't want to trot out his Nazi flag until he's sure he's not going to end up on Facebook."
"Not necessarily racist, could've just been someone with a narrow viewpoint or they live in a bubble.

Regardless, fucking love curry me"
"Oh yeah they're gonna send you youtube videos.  And share 'funny' articles.  They're probably quite racist but are trying to figure if you are too before really cutting loose.

If you have to encounter this person repeatedly; I like to fuck with people like this a little by always finding a reasonable way to side against observations they make that are clearly leading towards a slant, with a fact they can't disagree with.  You have to make it quite subtle and use it to stop them before they get to the final point in their argument.

People often set up 'arguments' by first getting you to agree with, or at least not disagree with one or two points before they put in their actual thought.  If you can see this coming, you can deflect by not just nodding along to each of the setup points, but by playing devil's advocate in the guise of asking a rhetorical question."

"I'm from Luton. The rest of you can go home, threads over."
"Words with this one, strong they are"
"And some Chinese restaurants do curry, so both the top two could involve eating curry, as could Thai."
"Of course they do, but they only eat it in Wetherspoons."
There is somewhere like this in Birmingham as well. It's called Birmingham
"Honestly it would be hard not to try curry.        
It's one of the most readily available and cheapest ready meals.      
It's ingrained pretty heavily in UK culture; eating in, a takeaway and as well as something you can cook yourself.

The only way I can see if happening is if they were raised to think of curry as a dirty foreigner dish so never introduced to it as a child and then go into the rut you describe."
"Possibly not lying if they actually think this is true.  People who hold a lot of prejudices often don't have a lot of life experience.  It's possible he's just bitter because he's never had the experience of going for a curry with friends, so he never gets it as take away because he doesn't know what to order.  So he's a bit bitter about the curry situation and is subconsciously using a bit of racism to feel better.

Edit: so I guess they're at least lying to themselves."
Bonkers isn't it? I would expect even racists to like curry.
Lunatic xenophobes sure. I just wish that they were a bit more fringe :(
I'd bet fifty quid that anyone claiming no one eats curry (when they do) and it's not really a British food (when it actually is) and it's a ploy to make us seem multicultural when we aren't (when we actually are) is racist.
Only because people from Luton couldn’t be arsed to vote
Thatcher regularly tops both most popular and most unpopular prime minister lists.
"I don’t think there’s anything subtle about it, he’s clearly racist in my books.  You can be a bit daft and out of the loop about Indian food, but the combo with supporting UKIP is open and shut."
I know 0 people who don't like a Korma
Can't say I've had the pleasure. I did once go on a date with a lady from Tehran that had previously lived in Luton. She said she was treated better as a woman back in Iran.
"I have no idea what you're on about tbh.

Did you mean citizen's arrest?

That refers to either an any person power of arrest under common law for breach of the peace, or an arrest made by any person (who is not a Constable) under s24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which is limited to indictable offences.  There are some edge case restrictions (polling stations, public order, etc).

Any person power of arrests incorrectly used can easily result in unlawful false imprisonment, and assault offences for the individual attempting to arrest."
"Nah, Ukip voters prefer a [chinky](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11303133/Nigel-Farage-defends-use-of-word-chinky.html)."
"Yeah, recent events have shown the the UK is pretty evenly split on whether fucking itself up is a good or bad thing."
"They are wrong.

UKIP had Carl Benjamin (A.K.A Sargon of Akkad) run for them recently.

He is a vile, racist, sexist, anti-intellectualist cunt. If you want to know more about why he's a shitheel, check out Hbomberguy's videos about him on YouTube. https://youtu.be/rc24YtUslCU

This is pretty emblematic of the party as a whole.


Not long ago, the leader of UKIP switched to the Brexit Party, and took most of his voters with him.

The brexit party are also shit. They claim to be anti-establishment, but you can't get much more establishment than Nigel Farage and Annunziata Rees-Mogg.
They have Anne Widdecombe who is homophobic.

Not to mention all of their policies are basically Tory policies, but further right and more xenophobic."
"I worked as a picker. It gets a lot of negative press but I really enjoyed it. Lots of walking and exercise, getting to see the weird things people bought.

Two negatives- the warehouse was massive. If you were at the wrong end when break started, you spent your whole break walking out. And if you work when a new Jamie Oliver book comes out, you're gonna be lifting a lot of his heavy gurning face."
The problem- especially asking on the internet- is that most people will claim *their* town is the biggest shithole because it's just a weird thing that British people do
"There is literally place in manchester nicknamed curry mile because there is about 70 curry houses in that small of a stretch. I doubt if only immigrants ate curry there would be that many. Your mate is chatting BS, and I'd be very wary of what else he tells you."
Following this thread of comments just to learn new ways of swearing at people and this one takes the cake!
Fucking wank puffin
"Honestly I think you should speak to the uni and ask to defer, which means they would give you a place the following year. Pregnancy is exhausting. You will not be able to focus. You will not be able to go out drinking with your new friends even if you are tea total. I was in bed by 8pm with my first every night in the 3rd trimester. There’s also morning sickness. 

If you can defer, then defer. It’s is an absolutely amazing thing you are doing, but you need to look out for yourself too. Your first year of uni is meant to be a fun experience and if you can delay that until you’re not pregnant you will have a much more traditional experience of uni."
"Sounds like a serious piece of excrement and, most likely, a massive racist"
Chinese curry sauce on chips. Yum!

"&gt; I like to fuck with people like this a little

Like offering them a samosa and saying it's a new type of pasty?"
They're extremely fringe at the moment because Farage has launched the Brexit Company as his next platform for making money out of xenophobia. But your broader point is totally understandable
"Tikka Masala was actually invented in Britain an all, proper British food that!"
"Curry is one of the most popular cuisines in the UK. If you go to a supermarket and check out the chilled section you will find Italian and Indian food in abundance. Chinese food is popular but not as much variety followed by food from Japan, Mexico and the Caribbean. Tradional British food is also quite popular but it kind of defeats the point to state that as its so obvious.
I think premade meals have such a large variety of Indian food because people here love it but find it difficult to make from scratch. Having said that many of the ingredients weren't available in supermarkets when I was a kid. They are becoming easier to find. Many people my age like to attempt to make Indian food from scratch but it involves a lot of trial and error. Also effort to source the right ingredients."
where I am you could get a curry in probably 5 of those places
He’s an idiot. Curry is probably the most popular takeaway. There’s at least one curry place in every town.
"Britain (well a British immigrant who ran a take away) invented a new curry - chicken tikka masala - and it's now basically the default in people's heads for what a curry is.

Indian food takes up an entire side of an aisle in supermarkets, there's at least 1 Indian in every town or city. The average Brit spends over £300 a year on curry.

Top comment is right, you were talking to a twat. Probably some racist git that doesn't want to admit letting other cultures move here has a benefit."
"Hey, even racists like a good curry."
"For racist jokes just say ""I don't get it, can you explain?"". Nothing makes a racist more uncomfortable than having to explain their prejudices."
It's a very popular dish.
"Yeah, there’s no reason to say something so stupid and so obviously untrue unless you need it to be true to support your warped agenda/worldview where Britain is worse off for the immigrants who have moved here.

The real problem is that our native filth (as opposed to like, good natives) are annoyed that quite a lot of those immigrants are a lot better than them, and that they don’t automatically default into superiority anymore.  They’d be quite happy to have immigrants so long as they were still allowed to go “Paki hunting”.  ( this was a real thing and a lot of the people who used to do it are alive and voting for brexit now, remember that.). White supremacists don’t want to have to try to succeed in society."
It's also one of the things you'll always see in the readymeals parts of supermarkets.
"Yep, the village I grew up in doesn’t have a pub anymore.. but it has a curry house"
"First time I've heard anyone call sheffield a shithole, I find it's a lovely place to live, even in a rough area."
"She’s decided she doesn’t want to keep the child. It’s her choice. It’s not a ‘pathetic excuse’ to give up the child to go to university, and she’s not giving it up just to study - she doesn’t want the child. Instead of terminating (also a valid choice) she’s opted for something else and she doesn’t need to be berated.

I do agree she needs to talk to people about the next steps, but she has made her choice."

Your friend is completely wrong."
"Could that be partly because going out to eat is expensive and right now people have a bit less than they did?  Or just that we tend to go out for dinner less as we get older and people move further from their friends/ have kids?  I think it's as popular as it was as a dish, but we don't go for as many curries as we get older."
"I used to deliver chinese food and people would shout that in their house when I got there with the food. ""the chinky is here"". I'm not chinese before anyone asks."
"You 100% need to speak to an adoption agency. We are hoping to adopt as we can't have any more biological children and the process is VERY rigorous for adoptive parents and there are a lot of people out there waiting to give a child an amazing home. They really do everything to try and make sure that the adoptive parents are absolutely the right home for that child.

There are a few methods of adoption, whether through a private agency or a public (council) one, that will have different rules on communication between birth and adoptive parents. Most people adopt without contact with the birth mother, but that's not to say you can't arrange that if it's important to you.

What people can't do is pay you for adoption so I don't think you will be able to get any financial help here but if you're pregnant and low income/not working there may be benefits you're entitled to and your midwife will know of them all. If you were a surrogate you would be able to get help with expenses, but I'm not sure if that applies to adoption - if it did, I suppose it would be most likely through private adoption agencies. Either way you need to speak to an agency who will answer all your questions in a sensitive and no-pressure environment far better than people on the internet though.

I'd recommend googling ""adoption agency &lt;your area&gt;"" and dropping them an email or a phone call. Your midwife should also be able to give you loads of resources and put you in touch with someone to talk about it.

I wish you the very best of luck."
"&gt;If so, tell the Guardian, they'll eat them alive.

Absolutely - the University is basically forcing OP to choose between giving birth and her education.

Shocking."
Approx 35000 restaurants in UK serving curry. How is that not popular! Ignore the racists and get your curry on!!
"Picture this: I’m from a small town of 10,000 people. It’s not big enough that any major chain store will set up there. But it has 8 Indian takeaways. It’s got to be pretty popular to sustain that. 

Fun fact: most ‘Indian’ takeaways in the UK are also actually run by families of Bangladeshi origin."
"Maybe it's referring to places like Subway, rather than supermarket sandwiches."
"Nah, your mate's wrong! Curry is a go to takeaway dish and whether you live in a large city or a small village, you're probs never far from a curry house!"
"Supermarkets usually have a entire fridge devoted to curry. One of our biggest pub chains does a curry night every Thursday, as a teenager I used to go most weeks with friends and I still eat curry on a Thursday now (albeit no longer at Wetherspoons)"
Personally prefer going out for a curry but having seen this post I now want one and it's only 7am
"Hey, OP British Bengali guy here 


Nearly all ""Indian"" restaurants in the UK is owned by Bengali people. This has to do with a lot existing pre-1971 (its a long and bloody history). My dad owns one haha also ""Indian sounds more exotic than ""bengali"". So most people in the UK love Bengali/Indian/Pakistani food (all restaurants do dishes from all 3 countries).

Anyways my point was: your average British white person knows waaaaay more curry dishes than your average British brown person! Haha"
"Right idiot for sure, I don't like curry and I can ensure you I always felt the ""odd one"" as everyone eats the stuff. People love that shit more than their own parents! I for sure appreciate how popular it is, sounds like a stupid plank who wants a excuse to spew racist crap."
"What you need is a desi-pub.

The perfect example is the old mosely arms. Old British pub, now owned by a Sikh family, still a great pub, but the pub food is curry. I do believe the evolution of the pub may have peaked. It's right next to Edgbaston Cricket ground, I don't quite know what they do when games are on, because I avoid the area when they are, but I heartily recommend it."

"Not me personally but I know a guy who retired from a reasonably high pressure job at 60. He realised he was bored and loves walking and went to work there. I think he likes the low stress, you really don't have to think critically, the walking for hours on end, it keeps him fit and stops him getting bored at home. Unfortunately the pay is pretty rubbish (minimum wage) but as he's retired he doesn't really need it and it's more like pocket money. Hope this is helpful!"
I live in a small rural village but we have 2 curry houses within 100m of my house. I get a takeaway a couple of times a month but eat home made curry at least twice a week.

"Yeah if is very popular. I live in a small market town that must have at least 4 or 5 Indian restaurants/takeaways.

"The wiki article that you link to states that 2018 resulted in 'a record breaking number of' wildfires.

The UK has heathland and moorland fires pretty much each year - some larger, most smaller. I work in heathland conservation, and so have dealt with the aftermath of a few over the years. I really have no idea what the criteria are to classify them as a natural disaster though.

In some places, burning of heathland has been a regular management tool historically, and the vegetation is generally very well suited to recover.

However, clearly there are concerns for safety of people and property when this happens in large, uncontrolled ways.

Also, with increasingly fragmented and isolated areas of habitat, it can result in the loss of populations of rare fauna that live in affected areas.

In general I don't think that the majority of the UK population are even aware of this as a phenomenon,  let alone concerned by it, but locally, among those who may be affected, and those who work in conservation,  yes, it is a growing concern."
"I was really shocked when I realised that word is still in common use. I know this is Judi making excuses, but some people don't realise they shouldn't be saying it, it doesn't cross their mind that it's offensive. My MIL referred to a child as 'mongoloid' not knowing that we don't say that any more and why we don't. I'll always correct people when I hear things like that but it didn't make for a comfortable Christmas."
