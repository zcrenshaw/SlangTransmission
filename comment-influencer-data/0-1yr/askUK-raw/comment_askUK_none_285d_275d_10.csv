I think the whole thing is fake.  I’ve never seen Gatwick Airport with my own eyes and I don’t think it really exists.
I'm trying. Some selfish jerk wants to fly airliners there.

So they make extra sure they've got the right things in the right quantities, rather than rushing it out.

They will tell you if you're fired or not. I can't imagine they would pursue criminal damages unless your employer is an A* arsehole of a company. I doubt they will, will cost them more in legal fees to take you to court than just getting the door fixed."

"Is there a [parkrun](http://parkrun.org.uk) near you?  9am every Saturday morning (with bonus ones on Christmas and New Year's Days in some places), completely free, and it gets you up and out rather than staying in feeling like crap.  Every one I've been to has had a really sociable crowd who go for coffee after, and stand and chat and cheer on other runners during the run.  It's only 5k (3 miles) so it's perfect even if you're a first-time runner who has to walk it (many runs have 'tail runners' so you're guaranteed not to come in last place, if you're worried about that).  Exercise and sunshine are great ways to boost your mood when you're feeling low."

"To be honest, your colleagues seem like cunts. Whilst trying to speak to your boss and explain the situation, I also think it would be a good situation to explain any bad behaviours that your colleagues have shown to you before which may have influenced your actions. 

I'm not suggesting that kicking and breaking the glass is an acceptable reaction, but I'd be more willing to bet it's been a growing issue where your colleagues have been teasing you under the guise of ""banter"" until you've finally had it and lost your temper. I can assure you I'd be just as pissed off - arriving late at work and my colleagues thinking they're funny by not opening the door would really cause me to lose my temper. It seems like you just had a bad day up until that point and they just pushed you over the edge. 

Apologise for your actions, but explain what really caused you to act like that. Workplace bullying shouldn't be tolerated, and there's a blurry line between genuine banter and straight up bullying.

"I already left, and have no plans to go back for the forseeable future. Never had a problem with 'violence' or 'busyness' myself - those things seem to only apply to a small number of urban areas in England not the UK in general. The problem for me was lack of decent graduate jobs. I think so long as you have the money to live in good accomodation in a good area, the UK is among the best places to live in the world. But for those of us who don't, it's better to go elsewhere, not because other countries are inherently better, but because being a Brit in other countries opens up opportunities that you don't get as a Brit in Britain."

"Are you talking about home made stuff, or goods bought in a supermarket?

If it's the latter then it's likely down to preservatives. The UK is a very small country; a cake manufacturer can make a batch of cakes and have them on store shelves within a day - because of this they don't need to be chock full of 'functional' ingredients to preserve product life. You'll see the same effect in things like sandwiches too - buy a prepacked sandwich on the continent or abroad and you'll be surprised by the difference. Similarly we're one of a handful of countries who primarily consume fresh milk for the same reasons. It's great!

"OP, this rant isn't at you but I apparently have a lot to say on this matter, so apologies for this tirade.

As well as an increased workload on pharmacists these days (ageing population and lots of polypharmacy - multiple chronic conditions managed by drugs), like other people have said... the stakes are much higher than you imagine. The second you hand over any dispensed drugs, you are liable for what is in that package.

Also, look at how similar generic drug packaging is: [image](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7vKqO2qbfAhWSxYUKHYeFAYcQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chemistanddruggist.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fhow-avoid-errors-similar-drug-packaging&amp;psig=AOvVaw3XeTh4uUtStLjSX7K5aJ9w&amp;ust=1545130582003611).

Distinguishing between these, making sure the prescriptions are actually legal (lots of requirements are needed for a script to be dispensed) - you'd be surprised.

People can now also order their prescriptions electronically - so there are a lot of scripts coming over from various surgeries and practices that you don't see that all require attention.

A pharmacist will be supported by multiple dispensing assistants - the pharmacist has to check and recheck their work to make sure the drug is the correct dosage, formulation (tablets or capsules? suppositories or pessaries? Cream or ointment?) They are very similar and when you have 30+ scripts stacking up, easy to mistake one for another.

Checking any interactions and contraindications of the drugs prescribed. That's up to the pharmacist to check too.

Performing patient reviews to ensure they are taking the medicines correctly and that they are working. Flu jabs now too. And of course you get the elderly folk who come in for a natter - sometimes a conversation is more helpful to them than the medicine. But the queue grows regardless.

All of this as well as (especially in the case of independent pharmacies ^and ^chain ^pharmacies ^actually) managing a business, stock levels, and employees...

Pharmacists train for 4+1 years to qualify, and at the end of the day are very misunderstood in their profession. They can help you out a lot more than you'd think! 

*sigh* I don't miss pharmacy.

edit: Also, mistakes are criminal law. Negligence is criminal, pharmacists can be convicted, stripped of their registration status, and imprisoned for mistakes. The juice ain't worth the squeeze."

"Manchego's a bit specialist and I wouldn't normally expect to see it on a Christmas cheese board.

Try as many or as few of these as you like:

* strong mature cheddar
* some kind of blue cheese; stilton is traditional but a lot of people find it overwhelming. Blue Wensleydale is milder, or Cambozola if you like soft cheeses
* a strong Red Leicester (if you can find the one branded ""Red Fox"" I highly recommend it)
* a cheese with fruit in. Wensleydale with cranberries is easy to find in all the supermarkets, but there are so many amazing fruit cheeses around if you look
* soft cheese of some kind. Brie or Camembert are always good, but try one of the stinky French cheeses for maximum flavour. Pie d'Angloys is again widely available in supermarkets, but a specialist cheesemonger should have many others
* some kind of crumbly tangy British cheese: Cheshire or Lancashire. Eat them the Yorkshire way, that is a thick slice of cheese on top of fruit cake. Seriously, it's amazing.
* a personal favourite of mine is Port Salut, which is semi-soft, it never seems that popular with others which means all the more for me


or just ask your cheesemonger what he'd recommend, telling him if you'd prefer strong flavoured cheeses or milder ones?"

"Bullying is always a hard one to pin down because it's very subjective and can be difficult to prove. Honestly, my advice is the same either way - find a new job and leave.

No job is worth your mental health, you're unlikely to ""win"" anything even if it is bullying, and if it's not then it's not going to magically stop it affecting you.

My advice to somebody else would be to be more assertive and stand up for yourself more, but I think you've been quite honest in your post and that isn't a tactic which is likely to work."

"So many condescending comments on this thread. There are plenty of reasons someone may need more sleep than others, especially when working flat out all day. 

That IS overkill in the amount of work you are meant to do both in the school day and at home. I would find it concerning that you don’t have time for hobbies/other activities other than sleep. As another commenter said, go to your form tutor or head of year and raise your concerns. Mention that it isn’t just you feeling this way. At the least they should be able to offer some mentoring to support you in time management/ revision. 

I really disagree with the “this is the easiest you’ll have it” comments. Teenagers are expected to do so much at such a turbulent age including things they have no interest (or ability) in. This changes as you get older and can pick your career path/education and your hormones calm down. "

Including the fact that the teacher made jokes about an Indian and a Chinese student also then it does have a heavy lean towards racism.

HOWEVER, it would be interesting to find out if the teacher is also making comments about white-british students aswell. If they are just taking the piss out of everyone equally then they are mostly an arsehole rather than a bigot, they still deserve to be reported mind you.

(Just to clarify I think the story as it stands is that the teacher is being racist and should be reported as such)"
