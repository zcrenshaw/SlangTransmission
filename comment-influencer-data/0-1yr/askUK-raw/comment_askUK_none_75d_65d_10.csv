"To an extent. To give an example, I worked at RBS when they bought ABN AMRO, a Dutch bank. We had to give the Dutch staff cheat sheets because they thought when a UK manager said "" that's an interesting choice, I'll think about it"" they meant anything other than  ""you're a fucking idiot, get out of my sight"""
Just look at house prices/average income.
"Talk to the school and see if another form of id would be acceptable because she's part of an organised school trip.

One of our kids went to France using a photo id lunch card because we'd done the same.

Failing that talk to the passport office and see if going there in person will help speed things up."

When a starter home is nearly 3x as expensive and your wages have gone up 20%, it isn't laziness when you can't afford the fucker."

"I generally microwave a kipper mid-morning in the open-plan kitchen which adjoins the office. And, if the mood takes me, I‚Äôll follow that up with an open-top egg mayo sandwich made fresh.

That amount is completely abnormal. You need to up your drinking game OP.
"When I was 16 I decided the best way to pay for a festival ticket was to work the year before I wanted to go doing the clean up afterwards. I honestly feel like it should be compulsory for people to have that experience, because then maybe people wouldn't be so quick to do shitty things.

Probably worst experience of my life, but I learnt a lot about the average human. Puke, piss, shit, tampons, nappies, drug paraphernalia everywhere. I've seen lots of people defend it with ""but you got to pick up any phones and money!"". Yea right, as if people actually forget those items and if they do that they somehow aren't covered in one of the above. I came away with nothing at all from that job except minimum wage which was like ¬£3.60/h"

"It's a pyramid scheme. If these instafucktards were making any money on Forex, then they'd likely have enough notoriety that you'd have heard of them, or a fucking LinkedIn page.

"To put things in perspective, I'm in ¬£40,000 of debt with my degree (which I probably won't ever fully pay off) and in contrast my dad was *paid* to go to university by some strange government initiative that won't exist anymore - he took the money, did one year, left, and then went and used the rest to move to London (Greenwich no less) and pay his rent. 

He was hard-working and made his way through other career paths, so I'm not knocking that, but he didn't have to pay back a penny. Mental."
"I'd move on, accepting a counter-offer puts you in an awkward situation and frankly, they should've offered you the extra cash earlier!"
"No. You passed. Two of my year didn't survive til graduation, several more failed out in the earlier years, and a couple didn't meet all the requirements to pass with Honours (so just got pass degrees) so I was damn well going to celebrate getting my Third with everybody else. If anyone was snotty about it they had the good taste not to do it in front of me, and I had a great time celebrating with my mates.

Go, enjoy it. Well done on making it through in one piece."

"I often find these conversations hard to have without seeing some actual numbers. So, here's mine.

My parents bought three flats for around ¬£20,000 each in the early 90s. Their combined salaries at the time were around ¬£14,000 and they worked normal jobs (bank assistant manager and secretary) and had no bother getting ¬£60,000 of mortgages.

Those flats are worth around ¬£425,000 total now and generate about ¬£20,000 p/a in income.

Oh, and they were also able to buy a whole other house outright from the income they'd saved. That now rents for ¬£12,000 p/a. This is on top of the house they actually live in which they bought in the early 2000s for ¬£360,000; it's now worth more than twice that.

My parents have never earned more than ¬£30,000 combined from their actual jobs and yet they now have probably ¬£1.5m in assets with very little debt. That's not possible now. Hell, it's ¬£750 p/m to rent a two bed flat in my hometown where the average wage is ¬£18,000.

Your dad is peak boomer."

"I assume it's because policing is not a devolved issue in Wales, plus it shares a legal system with England. But in Scotland and Northern Ireland it is, so they probably have separate systems and procedures for gathering and reporting crime statistics."

"Generally speaking, the smaller the positive or negative is made out to be, the more profound it actually is.

I might describe a colleague I barely know but have had mildly positive interactions with as 'a great guy', and if really pushed to it I might admit that my very best mate is 'Alright, I suppose'.

Similarly, I had 'a fucking awful day' when the bus was three minutes late and my Amazon delivery got delayed for a day, and I'd 'had better weeks' when I lost my job the same week three family members died."
"They're lazy cunts, it really is as simple as that. They think that somebody else should clean it up for them. Festival organisers clear it up for a cost but imagine if the cunts cleared up after themselves, the festival could put that money back into what they do best, entertainment, not waste clearance.  
It takes less than half an hour to walk around your area with a bin bag and take your rubbish to the bins. Don't want your tent or your smelly fucking sleeping bag? Take them to the bins as well.  
My 9 year old can clear up after himself better than these pricks, if you do this you should be ashamed."

"In 1997, my mum was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease which caused loss of her kidney function. She was seriously ill and spent 3 days every week in hospital for dialysis. They were advised never to travel more than 100 miles from the hospital.

At about 2am one morning, completely out of the blue, she received a phone call about a potential kidney match. She was advised that it was a ""perfect"" match for both blood and tissue type. I will never forget the look of hope in her eyes as she received the news. 

I can't even explain how her life has changed since her transplant. Not just her life, but the life of my dad and all of the family around her. She is genuinely well again for the first time in over 20 years. They are now able to go on holidays in the UK and abroad for weeks at a time and I have never seen her so well and happy in my lifetime.

Thank you so so much for doing this. You are a hero amongst men!"

My next door neighbour has an immaculate garden: a neatly trimmed lawn with a little fountain and some lamps. But it's also basically sterile. At least my wildflowers are giving the insects something to work with, I hope."

It's not a good idea to use a comedy of manners as a gauge for how the average person in a particular country communicates. It's satire. While it may have its roots in reality, it's going to play it up and exagerrate it for comic effect.   
  
Also, consider that many British comedies of manners are set in the past, and specifically target a certain wealthy class who were often more rigid adherers to social conventions i.e. they were constrained by what to say/do and what not to say/do. Compare this with the lower classes, who were economically limited but socially more free, and you'll realise these comedies only satirise a small proportion of society."
