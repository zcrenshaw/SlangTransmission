"Possibly correct, possibly being a knob, a standard electric oven circuit will run on a 35A independent circuit, this gives you a maximum wattage of 7700 watts,depending on what you are buying you may need a circuit separate for the hob.

Ovens range from 1000 - 5000 watts

induction hobs run from 3000 - 7200 watts, 

Obviously A high rated oven and a high rated hob will require independent circuits but.... and it is a big but....

If you are buying a 5000 watt oven AND a 7200 watt hob, you are not buying cheap and the cost of running the new wiring will be a small proportion of what you are spending when buying into that sort of tech."
It's at that point where you have to widen your scope. I did so.many different admin jobs to data entry to customer service and even procurement. Now I do a manual labour job cleaning out ibc tanks. 4 years ago I never thought I'd do a job like this buts it's been 2 years and I mostly like it better than other jobs. 
Did you need GCSEs for those jobs. I don't have Maths and English GCSE and that is the requirement for most jobs. 
The insurance alone will probably fuck you right up tbh. Also Amazon is apparently hell on Earth so think carefully before doing this.
"I've put tens of thousands through PayPal, both business and personal, and never had any grief. If you follow it through properly i.e. trusted sellers, verified accounts, then there's no issue.

"Problem there though is that the US college soccer league, because of that landmark case where universities were required to give equal funding to programs for both genders, represents the pinnacle of female soccer earnings globally. That's why you had that protest by the US international soccer team last year, once subject to the commercial realities of their league they are shocked by how much less they earn then men. So in short, women coming to the US to play college soccer are mostly doing it _for_ the soccer, not the college."

"For undergrad it's pretty rare.  You hear of the occasional scholarship being offered to a UK student to go to Harvard, Yale etc and sometimes some people would go to good STEM colleges like MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, maybe Caltech.  Far more would attend for postgrad - lots of people will go to the US for MBAs in particular, with Harvard, Penn (Wharton) being well known, and again for STEM at postgrad people would go maybe to Columbia, NYU, Duke, UCSF / Northwestern/UW maybe in addition to the others I already mentioned.

Agree with others that well regarded colleges like Dartmouth, Emory, Brown, Rice, Purdue, Carnegie Mellon etc are pretty much unknown in the UK."
"Well, bully for you ;) "
"I used to think so too but now I wonder how plausible it'd be to cover it up so well. Where on earth did they hide her body that it still hasn't turned up? When did they even do it? It'd either have to be right after her death before they raised the alarm or they somehow managed to hide her body inside the resort, then dispose of it later during a press frenzy. Logically, she couldn't be that far from the resort, right? 

Also the whole thing about the DNA evidence from the boot of the car and the cadaver dog alert turned out to be pretty inconclusive.  "

"I had exactly the same thing when I moved in to my flat. The worst part is how you yourself can’t contact openreach, it had to be our broadband provider. Best thing is to contact your broadband provider again and make sure they book it with you on the phone, that’s what we did. Openreach’s customer service/system is the biggest load of shite and seems to make 0 sense from the point of the user. "
"Sorry, I realise now how confusing the .gov website is with this. I get what you mean about it not being clear what you should do.

I would assume you would need to renew it; you can say that you've lost your old passport and reported it stolen and then it asks for parent details to confirm that it's you. That said, it might be worth [calling](https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line) them to ask for advice just to be sure. It might be safer to do that than risk wasting £75."

If you want to just get out of the house, go for walks. Maybe there's some good nature trails or something in your area to make it more interesting? Listen to audiobooks/podcasts and you'll likely walk much further than you anticipated!

At least then you're helping with the weight, but also getting out from under your parents nagging."
"I guess Ivy League but the only reason I could see a UK student studying in the US would be because they wanted to live there or there was a subject that was only studied over there and not here in Europe.

"Not disagreeing with this theory, but one point: why would they want to want to save on the cost of a babysitter if they were open to the idea of using one? They could afford an evening sitter for a few hours, even at hotel rates. I think the point was that at the time they were not the only parents in resorts leaving their children to sleep in the room whilst they were at a restaurant on the site, with regular checks. It seems crazy to consider now, but it wasn't unheard of at that time; not the norm, but not completely out of the realm of possibility. "

Scheduling their jobs can also be a nightmare.  To connect one job they may just need to spend 15 minutes in a cabinet.  For the next, seemingly identical one, it may end up with a team for a couple of days replacing cabling and equipment."
"Well done on looking after your health. I agree with your point that you want a paid job - especially for your own self respect - but in the meantime volunteering is a really good move. It shows that you didn't just stay at home (which can't be good for your mental health), shows that you're able to work, and gives you a reference. 

You've mentioned a lot about your anxiety etc. In my town there's a scheme helping people with mental health issues and/or disabilities find job placements. Is there anything similar where you live?"

Returning it isn't really an option. It's a long story, but we ended up buying it from the other side of the country (near where my parents are) and having to arrange our own courier to drop it to us in Bristol (Parents were unable to for various reasons).

As I said in the OP, lessons have been learned. Valuable lessons at that. "
"Trustpilot reviews don't really say anything as Trustpilot aren't consumer-facing. People arent going to praise Openreach on Trustpilot because it would be their ISP that takes the credit.

"I had the same question, I got in contact with HMPO and received this response:

 

&gt;Thank you for your enquiry relating to your application.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;As  you have stated you have had a passport in the past this is not a first  time application. You must submit this application as a replacement of a  lost or stolen passport. We understand that you will not have the  details of the passport to hand so you would be advised to complete the  application to the best of your ability.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In order to obtain a replacement passport, you must complete a new application form. This can be done on-line at [https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passpor](https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport)or via a standard application form (SE04) which can be obtained from selected Post Office Limited branches.

And then some other bits and bobs.

This was about a year ago but I never actually bothered with it because I didn't actually want to go abroad, I just wanted to get it sorted as it's basically the keys to the kingdom re: proving my identity.

&gt; So, you thought it was important that your three children knew that you ""couldn't make love to Gerry""? And that they would appreciate being able to read about your very vivid imaginings about what a paedophile might be doing to Madeleine? If Madeleine were to turn up at some time in the future, I'm not sure that she would appreciate being reminded, if she had been abducted by a paedophile and somehow had managed to live and escape.

Similarly, if it goes minus, the outside tap of many houses may freeze up. 

I think it's BY FAR the smaller risk to go with a person you trust for something like this. So actually, I'd relax.
