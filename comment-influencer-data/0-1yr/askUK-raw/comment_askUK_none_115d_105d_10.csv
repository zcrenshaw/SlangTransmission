"I'm surprised you managed to write so legibly, what with the massive fluorescent customized fake nails you must have on."
Piers Morgan revolts me.
David Walliams. He gives me massive ‘sex pest’ vibes.
"&gt;I'm close to quitting my job and trying a working holiday in somewhere like Australia just to break the monotony of the grey skies and boring everyday.

Do it then. 

I mean honestly, if you find it depressing here, head somewhere else. I don't mean that in a ""fuck off if you don't like it here"" way, but if your life in this country makes you miserable then why are you still here?"
"There is nothing 'insulting' about your name.

Yes, it might conjure images of a certain 'trashy' kind of type, because it's a fairly new kind of name, and not a classic - but really it matters not a jot.

You might have got a jibe or two, but (and I don't mean to be partonising or insulting) Americans can be somewhat thin-skinned when it comes to British humour. No-one would *really* have been mocking you. We poke fun at each other all the time, for all sorts of crap. It doesn't mean much."
"Yes.

Source: My wife does it, and she is weird."
"If we told you it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?"
"- Cost of going out has increased, but wages haven't increased as much. 

- More entertainment options at home, eg Netflix. 

- More ways to meet people of the opposite (or same) sex, eg Tinder."
"I think theroux mastered the art of saying nothing long enough that the subject just speaks to break the silence, giving the production what they want. I'd guess the more famous you get, the easier that becomes"
"That would be a disgusting thing to do. Definitely go with a cricket bat, instead. It's more British"
"That seems like a GDPR breach to me!  
  
I would also be very reluctant to take a role with a company that operates like that. Name &amp; shame OP, this isn't anything like standard practice."
"Taking this at face value, although I'm not sure it deserves it:

&gt;do you think girls being benefit mums is accidental or a genuine mindset?

In my (fairly limited) experience of women to whom this has happened, it's not exactly a mindset in that it's planned and strategised, it's more that it's a fatalistic mindset when it happens.  You have a boyfriend, you get pregnant, you have the baby, the father fucks off, what else is there?  It's not as if having the baby and struggling on benefits and scrappy jobs is a worse option than what they expect to be their life anyway, so you might as well accept fate and have done with it."
"We’ve had running water for over ten years, we have a tunnel connecting us to Peru and we invented the cat."
"&gt;I've always understood it to mean ""of the court"" in Old English

That's almost certainly *not* the origin of the name. Old English for ""court"" would have been ""geard"". ""Court"" is Middle English / Middle French, from Old French ""curt"" which is in turn derived from Latin ""cohors"".

Best interpretation for Courtney as a surname is that it's either locational (cf. House of Courtenay, originating in Courtenay, France, later Earls of Devon) or the Anglicised from of the Gaelic ""O'Curnain"" as documented in various baptismal records.

Use as a given name seems to be an American phenomenon, first as a male given name and from the 1970s onwards also as a female given names.

&gt;So is it a name that's become synonymous with a sort of sycophantic white trash?

It's one of a string of given names which have become associated with a certain group of people. Others include various spellings of ""Ashlee"", ""Brandi, ""Britney"", ""Chantelle"", ""Jade"", etc..."
"You exercised your right to vote and you’ve come to realise that whoever you voted for doesn’t reflect your own views. That’s a really mature thing to say. Realising that you have made a mistake is the important part, it’s a difficult thing to say and do, one that many people have trouble with. 

Doing your own research is important, it’s out of date now as it was set up for the 2017 general election but https://voteforpolicies.org.uk is useful as it lays out all the major parties major polices without you knowing which is which. You click on the ones you agree with and you then get a result, it might be helpful to you in the future."
"Matt Baker. My aunt sat next to him on a two-hour flight last year and he spent the entire time sitting bolt-upright, motionless staring at the back of the seat in front of him."
"Nah mate she uses her thumb, the real question is how she slaps on 6 shades of fake tan but still manages to miss patches on her face and neck"
"I think most people living anywhere in the world can end up in this mindset, not to invalidate your feelings. 

If you think and a change is what you need you can work towards leaving, either forever or for long periods of time (Travelling or living elsewhere for many months a year, I will happily help you with the first!)

But if you are going to stay and ""stick it out"" then maybe focus on what we have here instead of what we might not. 

NHS is still a thing, you don't have to fear injury. 

Benefits are a thing and you don't really have to fully fear not having a job, or becoming disabled.

As long as your mind stays sound you will most likely always have a house over your head.

The whether can be bad as you said but it's almost always mild, there aren't tornado's or hurricanes ripping up towns. 

Crime is low, you are unlikely to be a victim of anything dire in your lifetime.

There are some beautiful places on these here isles.

Basically, at it's worst the UK is a comfortable place to spend your life."
You do realise British people will just take the piss over anything for a bit of banter..
All about the bantz
It’s a legitimate interview technique.
Cliff Richard. Total wrong 'un.
"If the guard questions it, just claim your ex wouldn't let you see your son today even though you planned a lovely day out and start crying."
"This is a soldier thing, not a Brit thing. Military conditioning causes fights"
I get a bad vibe from Kirstie Allsopp.
"That sounds possibly like catfishing. The most common way people get out of answering difficult questions about their online  lies is to suddenly have cancer, gearing up to ""dying"" then ghosting and blocking online."

"A formal GDPR complaint might be worth putting in, both in the hopes they'll give you an apology, and also that they won't do this to someone else in future."

"Other than James Corden, I'd have to say Russell Brand. Not like pedophile vibes, more like massive drug festival vibes that a few people die in, and Brand just buries the bodies in a mass grave in the New Forest with none the wiser."
I think it was Private Eye who made a compilation of all the news articles where Chris Evans offered to get himself and his staff naked for charity. It was a very frequent occurrence and definitely seemed to go beyond just novelty.
I...I'm pretty sure neither penises nor vaginas work like that.
I’ve comforted myself with the thought that the Tories have been such a dumpster fire since leaving coalition that the Lib Dems must have secretly been pulling a blinder to delay whatever this current government is for as long as they did.
"I went to an interview once and as I was approaching the reception (I had arrived early) a very smartly dressed girl was making a quick exit and she was basically in tears. When I got to reception I found at that HR had fucked up and sent her an interview invitation even though she hadn't been short-listed. Thankfully, I had been correctly inited but as they were telling me about the mistake, they were laughing.    
I got a really good impression of the company and their attitude so I basically ""thanks but fuck you"" and left the building. If it wasn't for that experience I would not have been put on the path I am on now so, I am actually grateful for their incompetence, tomfuckery and generally being horrible human beings.    
I don't know what happened to the girl though, I hope she is ok."
That big fucker from The Chase.
"Ok. So your interested in IT but you have no experience. 
Your customer service skills could be used to help you get into an IT role. 

Some IT service desks want customer service skills as they’re harder to teach than the actual tech skills. (As long as the person shows ability and want to learn)
Draw on those skills at interview, give examples of dealing with difficult customers, or where you’ve gone the extra mile for someone. 

A lot of people look down on service desks but I run one and the guys and girls I take on progress onto bigger roles within a few years. 
Use a service desk as an “in” and learn what you can, figure out what area of IT you are most interested in and build up your skills and knowledge ready to then apply for any roles that may come up - in house or externally. 

 Btw being 30 won’t hinder you, being mature and having life skills will put you in good stead. 

Good luck with your search!"
I tend to get strange looks when I eat the lemon from my drink in a pub. Not sure I'd just sit down and eat a whole one though.
"A lad has a *choice* between going into town in jeans, or tracksuit bottoms tucked into his socks. A girl has the choice to shave off her eyebrows and paint them back on with Jet Black Dulux.

"That was the Matt Baker waxwork decoy, the real Matt Baker spent the entire flight in the bathroom with the air hostesses."
He revolts most people to be fair.
"I have withdrawn my attendance which may seem petty but it's angered me that much.

No point name and shaming really it's not a big corporation just a secondary school where I live so I'd be giving my location away in the process."
"I think you find it boring because you’re waiting for excitement to find you, rather than going out and finding excitement."
"I’m from a very working class family and some of my lot would probably get called chavs for the way they dress. Ultimately though they’re no different from anyone else and dress that way because it’s convenient or they’re around people who dress that way. I think labels like chav are very reductive. I go out in trackie bottoms and I’ve got a shaved head but I work as an academic. I personally think I could trust the people who dress like this more than I could trust the suits in finance. Again, I’m probably wrong about those people, but we automatically assume those who appear different from us are in some way inferior."

James Corden or Piers Morgan. They’re both intensely odious but for very different reasons.

"In short, yes, Courtney is a rather common name among those of the lower socio-economic spectrum. Any insults directed at you will have been ""Banter"" which is poking fun at you in a good humoured/intended way."

"Young people don’t have as much money to fritter away these days. People who were into that sort of thing in the 90s and 00s are by now old and wise enough to have figured out that clubs are very expensive and, let’s face it, a bit shit."
"If there's communal coffee/tea/sugar, and it's sitting next to them, I'd see no reason not to assume it's also communal. If Janice doesn't want to share her hot chocolate, she can keep it elsewhere or label it accordingly."
He's an absolute wanker in real life too apparently
Also supermarket alcohol makes staying in a much cheaper option. My local Tesco has a better selection than any bar in town and all of it is cheaper.
"1) How old physical buildings are- even though you KNOW that abstractly, it will still surprise you. Some colleges in Oxford have REALLY old buildings e.g. the old bit of Merton (off the top of my head). Even stuff you think is pretty old e.g. Radcliffe Camera, the round thing, is quite modern by our standards, where old = Mediaeval and really old = pre-1066.

2) If you are able to travel by car, be aware that the Cotswolds are exactly what N Americans think England should look like- you can drive around and see a lot in a day and drink in the scenery and the  look of the little towns/ villages- if you search THIS sub for 'Cotswolds' there will be threads about the main places.

3) If you like old stuff and can get to Avebury (near Stonehenge) that is really really old. White Horse of Uffington and Maiden Castle are other interesting sights (google for them if you don't know what they are)."
"I think a lot of it comes from mirroring your environment. 

I grew up in a very impoverished area, and went to an all-girls secondary school. You'd be surprised how many girls even at 13-14 years old were talking about how they couldn't wait to have a baby. Some of them genuinely didn't even care about who the baby was with, and whether the dad stuck around. Consequently, lots of girls from my school had kids around 15/16 years old and are now single mums in council flats. 

They did it because their mums did it. And their mums mums did it."
"Richard Hammond. The 'Hamster' has been through a few things and inst a bad person, but the over the top, totally not funny homophobia really turns me off."
I took a year out when I was 25.  Did Australia.  My sole regret was that I went for a year.  Six months would have been better.  Go for it.
"6""6, close to 30st going to Thailand, those poor prozzies. If you go in after him it'll be like throwing a hot dog down the channel tunnel. 

His eyes are too close together and he shagged his 29 year old cousin for a few years. He's a right rum bugger. I bet his arse nuggets are like Meatloaf's daughter as well."
"I had an interview at a Marketing Firm for a Social Media Manager role. I had been made redundant at my previous employment (Marketing Manager) after only having worked there for 2.5 months as the company had gone bust. I had been hired when the company was already in trouble.

The interviewer outright said to me; “Well you obviously did not do your job very well”. So I asked them to explain what they implied. Interviewer responded; “Clearly you are not a very good marketer or you would of saved the company.” I got up, shook his hand and said that I hoped he would find the right candidate to match his attitude."
"Probably my favourite response here.

Thanks haha!"

"&gt;in the wee hours

First off, stop advertising them as that. Try  ""The Urinate in Your Own Home Hours"" instead."
"Here's a deeply unpopular opinion, but having worked managing bars and nightclubs right through the '90s and 2000s, I believe it has some validity:

The process used to be that you went to a pub, drank pretty quickly and were then turfed out shortly after 11 so that you could interrupt your night, spend a half hour queuing and then pay to go into a place where drinks cost significantly more. Oh, and there was crowds of people and loud music. People who love this atmosphere always thought, and will continue to think that everyone else does too but ignored the fact that a) when you're young you will just follow along with your friends and b) there was no alternative.

Venues with club licences started experimenting with having a detached late bar on the same site in the '90s and the fact that these were always packed was an indicatior of what was coming. Then (in '99 I think) all venues were permitted to get late licences if they were up to building standards. Obviously this took a while and you had to be certain of the market before you started making renovations but over the next decade or two it happened and then clubs had no monopoly on alcohol and socialising after 11 and were only for those who really liked loud music and dancing. Most clubs reacted to this by raising prices to maintain profits, an action that came from their monopolist mindset, and it proved the nail in their coffin."

"&gt;casual anti English racism gets tiresome

As an Englishman who lived in Aus for 11 years, I didn't experience much anti-English racism at all except that casual banter (which I was quite happy to reciprocate)

&gt;distances are vast

Yes they are. But you get used to them. And Australia has the largest average private land size in the world, which is facilitated by the sheer amount of space it has. If your sick of tiny, cramped, shoe box houses, then Australia is your place. But that comes at a price - distance. 

&gt;food is more expensive

Food is probably 20% more expensive. But wages are significantly higher there. I took a 50% pay cut when I returned to the UK. Unless you work in an industry like finance, wherein you'd likely get paid more. Also, if you drive (which is almost a necessity in Australia) , then fuel is about literally half the price than in the UK. And insurance is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. 

&gt;TV is shit

Yeah TV is shit. But if you want to spend your time indoors, then you are missing the magic of Australia. 

Australia is great if you are the type of person that enjoys the lifestyle it offers. Some like it, some don't. The heat does get old though."
I don't think they have any self awareness at all.
Stephen mulahearn. Something about him is very 'off'
Very shocked at the lack of mentions the Royal family are getting here. The oldest generation are a right odd bunch and mostly married to their cousins. The younger ones look like American psycho types who'd set you on fire if you were homeless. With the exception of Harry of course who is clearly the product of an affair and all the better for it.
"First there will be the notice in the newspaper naming you and your family as transgressors. You will have to pay double income tax for five years and there will be a public flogging followed by a night in the stocks.

"Who's that over there?

No mates Nigel.

Oh, is he not very popular?

Naw, Nigel's a great guy. Everybody loves him.

So, why do you call him no mates Nigel.

*Shrugs* names Nigel, I dunno."
He seems to think pretending to be gay is the height of comedy. Utter bellend.
"People don't appreciate the power of silence to get your conversation partner to keep talking enough. It is relevant for so many fields, from therapy to sales. I have recently started working in sales and I need to improve a lot in this regards. Can't tell you the amount of times I listen back to a conversation and hear my prospect was about to keep talking about all this relevant information and I just blabber over them to avoid a moment's silence."
"&gt; Ricky Gervais.

At least he's not hiding anything, he's very open about how much of a horrible person he is."
"It is weird. Also, who the fuck cuts something into *five?*"
"I agree it’s highly unlikely. Young people in the UK are allowed to get medical treatment without parental consent, but in something this serious the doctors would almost always involve the family. If it’s something like cancer there would be loads of medical appointments at maybe different hospitals, obvious signs of treatment, medication to take (sometimes at complicated times, or to be stored). Plus the girl would be sick. I think it would be hard to hide. Sounds to me that she is story telling, if you still want to be friends give her a way out rather than trying to ‘prove’ she is lying. Saying you read about someone who was misdiagnosed, and could the Drs have made a mistake with her.

You are very sensible to be cautious with online friendships."
"""No, Quentin, you can't ever work again!"""
Went for too long.  Didn't have a structured plan.  It took me 3 months to recover from burn out.  But after that I should have had a structured approach to why I was there instead of bumming around cairns for six months out of the 12.
"I know this takes a lot of spoons (mental energy) but have you tried:

- Changing your GP, or GP surgery? You are entitled to see someone else, and they may listen to you. Ask reception whether any of the GPs at your current surgery are mental health specialists.

- Using PALS, the patient and advisory liaison service? You can complain about your experience and often they will provide an advocate who can put your side forward for you.

- Contacting MIND to ask about their advocacy service? They also have a database of mental health services by area and may be able to point you towards something you've not tried yet.

It is very hard when you feel like you're not being listened to and that your diagnosis doesn't fit you. It's against the rules and I'm in no position to give you medical advice anyway, but I would note that in my experience it can take a while to see the aspects of yourself that do fit a diagnosis. 
Group therapy and mindfulness are hard for most people with BPD, but if going to therapy and improving mental health was easy we wouldn't need help.

Not trying to doubt your experience, just something to consider that it's not unusual to react the way you have, or to find the suggested options really difficult/unhelpful at first. Coukd your husband or family be doing anything to help you to keep appointments?

Wishing you all the best - I know it's really tough and understand how disheartening and helpless the system can make you feel. Sending hugs your way OP."

"I don't like Eamon Holmes at all, but no one else seems to see it. 

I'll never forget watching him on This Morning a while back, on a phone in where someone was talking about finding love after her husband had died and she felt guilty, and everyone else was like ""No, of course you should move on, he'd want you to be happy"" and Eamon starts interrupting everyone to say ""maybe he doesn't want you to move on with someone else though, maybe he'd want you to stay loyal to him.""

Phillip Schofield is definitely hiding something

"My husband got me a Cliff Richard calendar as a joke gift, he was doing these wholesome yet hunky poses, like dressed in a leather jacket and sat on a bike, or wearing a cowboy vest and leaning an a haystack.

That is a totally normal way for any human male to behave.

"Well, it depends a bit on who you are and how you know this.

If, for example, you’re a doctor, you presumably have professional guidance you should be referring to rather than asking on Reddit.

If you’re talking about a child who is estranged from one of their parents, you should probably be asking a legal expert rather than asking on Reddit.

If you’re writing a book rather than asking about a real situation you should maybe mention that.
