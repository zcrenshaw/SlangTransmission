"Greggs will charge you more for a cheese and ham toastie (and they're very greasy) than they will for a ham and cheese baguette, but you can ask for the baguette to be toasted and it's pretty much the same, bigger and part of the meal deal."
"The Equality Act is one of Britain's best bits of legislation, and if anything about yourself (in particular any disabilities or health issues you may have) cause you any particular sort of trouble in life, it can probably help you. 

&amp;#x200B;

One example? I've sat in on two dismissal hearings for workers who had exceeded our company's tolerances for sick leave, both due to absences caused by their issues with anxiety and depression. One had a union rep with him, who argued his case under the Equality Act, making the point that his condition constituted a disability under the Act's definition, and as such, he was protected, and could not be dismissed due to absences related directly to his disability, which he had done his best to manage. The other had no rep, tried to argue his case by making excuses for his absences and that he'd tried his best, but made no reference to the Act or his rights under it. Two basically identical situations, but the first guy equipped with the Act kept his job, and the second guy without the Act lost his. First guy also now has 'reasonable adjustments' to help make his working life easier, which has further helped his wellbeing."

"Whether it's responsible or not, I think the technological changes really have to be acknowledged.

15 year is ago is when I was first really getting my feet into the workplace and it was such a different landscape - literally no social media. Twitter was yet to exist and nobody had heard of Facebook. Online communities existed, but in the form of forums. Neither Reddit or Digg existed.

So even though we did, of course, have mobile phones (albeit dumb ones), tablets (kinda) and the Internet - the entirety of communication, and it's expectations were just totally different. Nobody expected you to have or answer e-mails on the go unless you were important enough to have a Blackberry.

Text messages were defacto, but they still weren't automatically free.

And I really think that these things play into a real change of how people live their lives. The odds of something being caught on film was tiny, nobody knew what their school friends were doing, nobody saw each others holiday snaps etc etc."
"i think wetherspoons unfairly gets a lot of hate

"https://www.topcashback.co.uk/ Is totally legit. The best payouts I’ve ever had are £100 for changing energy supplier on two separate occasions and £67 cashback on a phone. I’ve also found they’re very good about chasing up cashback that doesn’t track and have always received it in the end. If you’re going to buy stuff anyway it’s always worth checking for any current deals - even if it’s just a tiny bit it all adds up in the end. 

Use a visa debit card or a credit card for big purchases as this gives you extra protection - check the exact amount but I think it’s £100."
"One thing that really changed things was the smoking ban, pubs and restaurants are far more family friendly, fewer people smoke and the place is a bit cleaner.

"If you know the dress code at the company, generally aim to dress at least one notch above on the formality scale. If you don't want to guess their dress code, then nobody will judge you for choosing to wear a suit to an interview.

Never wear a black shirt unless you're working as a bartender or nightclub promoter. A dark shirt - something like dark green or burgundy - might be acceptable without a tie if you're dressing for business casual or summer business formal without a jacket. I'd go for a classic white shirt under a charcoal, grey or navy suit, matched with a plain colour or sensible patterned tie of your choice in a traditional cut: no novelty or branded ties, bow ties, or razor-thin ties."
"They're not depressing, and the food isn't bad though.

What Wetherspoons *isn't* is a Mozambican interpretive dance and ironic 1990's cyber cafe fusion that serves breakfast cereal with ^^organic human breast milk.

It's a pub with a huge range of safe draught options, bottles, wines and spirits and simple food that serves a purpose. It's a chili con carne/chicken burger/bowl of chips, not a poncy tasting menu serving the *same* beef mice with a WhatAWanker markup/tax.

Why do people say it's depressing? I love going; all my friends get to meet up after work regardless of if they're in highway maintenance highviz, a suit or scrubs. We can all afford rounds. There's something for everyone.

The only thing Wetherspoons lacks is an air of pretentiouness."

"Deliveroo, for many reasons. I worked with them for a while and the way they treat riders and the way the managers act is pretty atrocious. You'll also notice that on top of the rider fee they charge the menu itself for most restaurants is more expensive than ordering direct from the place or popping into to collect. The company charge a percentage on all orders so restaurants have merely increased their menu price on Deliveroo to swallow this charge. If you're fine with this then you'll still be hit by riders who don't turn up, items missing, cold food or items spilled all over the bag. Good luck getting in contact with support and dealing with it."

"Vodafone, returned a phone day after I got it because I noticed that  I could get it much cheaper elsewhere, got my money back, 2 years down the line I get a knock at the door, turns out they didn't process the refund correctly so were still trying to charge me through direct debit, got a bill for 2k and they had got debt collectors called after me and threatening to take me to court, took a couple months to get it sorted and in the end I didn't pay a penny but it was easily the worst experience I have ever had, especially since their customer service reps are completely worthless and can't actually do anything.

"Amazon is a massive retailer who are one of the key reasons so many UK companies are going bust and why there are so few successful British start ups, not only are they killing British businesses and potential but by them avoiding tax it means even more of their money that they are taking from the UK is leaving the UK and going back to make the US and Jeff Bezos richer.

"Posting twice, as this one is more opinion based. I felt that the world had a lot more optimism back then - don't get me wrong, we had warnings of global warming, the Cold War wasn't exactly ancient history and of course 9/11 was a world changer.

But in domestic terms - life, money, work etc - everyone just seemed more positive about the whole thing. There was never any real doubt that I'd leave education, get a job and crack on.

""... eggs, flour, sugar...??!?!""

Turns out that 'Cake' = specifically plain sponge. All other cakes are part of some other category e.g. gateaux (French colleagues agreed with this categorisation too so it's not just Dutch-speakers.  A small research project may be needed to sort out the venn diagrams of cake ur-species)."

Being incredibly blonde she had almost no body hair and even if she did, I'd NEVER have commented but she was distraught!

"So, [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average#Statistical_location) can mean many things...

Imagin 5 people:

* Person A drinks 3 pints a week

* Person B drinks 3 pints a week

* Person C drinks 6 pints a week

* Person D drinks 13 pints a week

* Person E drinks 100 pints a week

Mode = 3 (as ""most"" people drink 3 pints a week)

Median = 6 (as the ""middle"" of the sample drinks 6 pints a week)

Mean = 25 (as Person E is a raving pisshead and is screwing with the group. Nobody wants to work with him because he stinks of booze all the time, never hands in coursework and generally ends the night with a fight)

Person D feels awesome because he's not average, but not a complete fucktard.

Each of the above could statistically be ""average"" if misused by the press. In other words, we don't actually know what an average of 51 really means when applied to everyone."

When I went to take it further it turned out that a lot of their policy / contract documents were ‘erroneous’ and to get resolution I’d have to initiate legal action in Ireland. I’ll never do business with them again.

Also Halifax for unfair compounding bank charges before they were outlawed. Absolute bastards."
"Anywhere there are major transport links such as motorways, airports, or ports there is an increase in human trafficking and sexual abuse. 

The posters serve as a reminder that the perpetrators of these crimes are under observation, to the victims that they can seek help through organisations such as this, and for *others* nearby that they should be alerting the authorities should they notice anything out of the ordinary. Similarly you will find a lot of posters in airports linked to human trafficking like [this](https://peakpacificgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HTA-2-photo-1.jpg).

Murder doesn't statistically increase around major transport routes, but unfortunately human trafficking and child sexual assault does. Hence, the posters, they're there to help build that awareness amongst staff and service users. To remind them that any major transport route is also being used by traffickers and sex criminals."

"As a decorator myself, find one good tradesmen and then ask him who he would recommend for other trades.

I know of one company who has just moved into a massive industrial estate building. They are in a prime location. Their work is the worst I have ever encountered. I wouldn’t even put them at an apprentice level. I once had the pleasure of watching them fit a custom oak door valued at £1200...then promptly roll expanding foam down the entire surface of it. 

On the other hand I know half a dozen carpenters who’s work is excellent and they don’t need the big building and advertising etc 

Best thing to do is go and see somebody’s house that has had similar work done. If you like it, use the same contractor.

I’ve seen tons of people on check a trade and all the similar sites who are terrible tradesmen unfortunately."
"If nothing's coming out of the taps, my guess is that he's turned off an isolation valve somewhere and forgotten about it. 

Troubleshooting further, if only cold water comes out (or again, nothing at all), there's a possibility that there's a thermostatic mixing valve installed near the tank to protect her from burns, especially if the installer at the time know she is disabled. If the ""plumber"" thought it was an isolation valve and screwed it fully open, it'll only allow cold water to flow.

10pm comes and goes with no sight of the green van. I call twice and don't get through (we are experiencing a large number of calls right now etc......). Eventually get through at 10.30 to be told 'oh, your local ASDA don't do delivery on Sundays'. Erm they could have told me that before/not accepted the order!?

I wonder if Greggs hacking will become a thing. Like the insider tips about how to get more out of Chipotle.
"I think people have become much more polarised in their political and social attitudes in that time span.  When I was at school (went to uni in 2001), I think the 'default' opinion of most people (as far as such a thing can exist) was that, generally, racism, nationalism, sexism, classicism, homophobia, were bad things and people who expressed such views were generally shamed.   I guess most people still feel this way, but such attitudes have crept back into the mainstream in ways which wouldn't have been seen in the late 90s.  It feels like the general assumption in support of progressive politics and social attitudes has been lost.

That said, there have been some significant steps forward in terms of legal rights and recognition for gay/trans people and definitely for mental health and people with disabilities.

The above is mostly stream of consciousness so won't be very well expressed, and will be largely from my perspective and experience and possibly former youthful naivety."
