"‚ÄúAnd Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.‚Äù

You get 20 + 8 specified holidays. They also require you to use 3 at Christmas. That's all OK.
Woah woah don't go that far buddy
"Go for it lad, it helped my mental health return back to its normal state. I hated going back home and dealing with family after a stressful long day at work. Try alone time in the sauna/steam room ."
"I think what it's saying is you need no formal training and so therefore you need to apply for a role and they will train you on the job. In other words, find a vacancy and apply listing your experience in the hope that you will get the role and then be trained on the job. I think?"
"My wife (works for NHS and was a nurse) says it‚Äôs usually done through on the job training and it doesn‚Äôt normally have specific requirements other than being a healthcare professional, and a lot of people pick it up as something they do on the side of their other role."
What's this got to go with the UK?
Why do you say that? Genuinely curious
Have you seen [this](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/wider-healthcare-team/roles-wider-healthcare-team/clinical-support-staff/phlebotomist)?
"A company which had provided goods or services to the Queen, Prince Philip, or Prince Charles for 5 of the last 7 years, also within the last 12 months. I was curious &amp; looked into this recently after providing a service to a royal, but not one of those 3"
"Exactly, I am Polish and I work for a charity. What people call poverty in UK in Poland would be considered a normal middle class. Poverty in UK still gives you a somehow comfortable life, the reality is that as long as you have at least one child you'll be fine. The worst off are single people under the age of 24"
"&gt;Is it normal to be worried about staying in a hotel (on holiday) in the UK?

No. No, it's not normal.

&gt;Is it ok for me to feel like this, as my (diagnosed) OCD will find it very very hard to sleep in a hotel bed?

Who defines what's okay for someone sick, us random people on the internet?

&gt;But is it possible to get a hotel which gurantees a clean mattress (plastic cover used) and antibacterially washed duvets?

Not bloody likely."
Sounds like me. I have Mediterranean blood and one of my grandparents happens to be half scottish.. guess what skin I get

"If I was to reccomend one thing to you it would be The SAGE Handbook of Sociology. It was my go-to resource for all things sociology related. 

Also, I had not studied maths for 5 years before starting uni and many courses take the 'science' side of the social sciences to heart.... this means a lot of focus on methods and statistics. There a book: 'Statistics Without Tears' which is fantastic. Copies can be found on ebay for ¬£3-¬£5 and as the name implies... it is a lifesaver."
"I agree with this. I would focus on addressing your views of yourself. Everyone looks exactly the same in a shirt, you won't be any different! You're a human like everyone else and people have been wearing them for centuries. Whatever shape you are, there is a shirt that can fit you. There are plenty of shirts that look stupid on me, and plenty of others that don't.

Either way, I think it's fine to wear different clothes to others if you want to, as a positive choice. It's a very different case when you're doing it out of fear - that's never a good place to make decisions from."
"Plenty of places will have good DnB on, all cities and a load of towns."
I thought normal coke was still ok and not tainted by sweeteners
Yes. You are signed off because you are unwell. If meeting your colleague outside of work will help you recover by maintaining your social connections and providing a break from your mental ill-health then it is conducive to recovery. Have a good lunch!

"&gt; if the taxi is to London from Carlisle!

It's mad that taxis actually do this.  You only get paid one way, it costs the passenger more than the train and it takes absolutely forever."
"Aaaaggh, not this shite!"
"Every time I go visit somewhere, go to an event, do some unusual activity etc, I always try to take one nice photo so I can remember that I did it, even if the photo itself is of something random.  The one thing I can't be arsed with is taking photos of famous places where you could just google about a million better photos than your own.  None of this goes on Facebook mind."
Add mental health jobs and missing people you're spot on
"If I'm at a picturesque area I'll go for a nice long walk for a few hours taking loads of photos, but then I put my camera away unless I see something really good.  I think it's nice on the first day to explore and capture the feel of a place."
"I‚Äôm having this problem right now. I‚Äôm in one of the most beautiful locations in the world and finding it really inconvenient to have to take pictures of everything rather than enjoy it. My brother lent me his GoPro so I took it snorkelling with a wrist strap and getting back on the boat I dropped it in the sea where it sunk to the bottom. I‚Äôve got to be honest, I‚Äôm very relieved I don‚Äôt have to think about it anymore."

"You borrow shares from someone and pay them a rental fee while you have them, but don't actually pay for them as such.  
You believe they are highly priced and will fall for some reason. 
Then you sell them.  

When they, hopefully, fall in price you buy them back and return them to the original owner.    

Sell high then buy low."
"You‚Äôre more likely to get punched as a police officer, you‚Äôre more likely to have to deal with horrifically injured people as a firefighter. How strong is your stomach?"

If you're that insistent on moving into that flat the only 'safe' way I can see is by joining a paramilitary group. At least then everyone knows that if they touch you their dead!
"Yep, we're all very much packed together here compared to you &amp; the US. In fact it's pretty much impossible to walk to places in the States, the roads don't have pavements mostly. My friend said people stopped their cars, thinking he'd broken down when he walked a mile between his motel &amp; the nearest shop"
 The arrows need to be a set distance before the junction. If the arrow had a left option you would run the risk of having people turning into the car park entrance that looks like it could be a pub or something.

"Honestly I have never done drugs but I‚Äôm not really bothered by it. But you are pretty much doing the worst of them - actual junkies would tell you to stop now (watch both Trainspotting films to make you stop doing Heroin).

So I‚Äôd say cut out the heroin, ketamine, meth (seriously man has no one ever told you how bad these all are!?) and I‚Äôd also say cut the coke and MDMA for good measure. Stick to weed and maybe shrooms. Also be careful with MDMA I‚Äôve known two people who have died from heart attacks from doing it (one also had multiple organ failure). 

I‚Äôm sure your mum would be mortified by the drugs you are doing. You aren‚Äôt going to graduate three years on your current path. To pass first year you only need 40% and you couldn‚Äôt do that, and it‚Äôs the easiest year. 

Also I‚Äôd try kick the smoking but it seems like you have an addictive personality anyway. Getting off hard drugs should be your priority."
That‚Äôs not English law though - what is your source?
"When do they give them out then you say? Late August? I go to the U.K. a few days before Bristol accom tenancies start, so they should give the offer at least a few weeks before I arrive"

"As a young child (under 11) I loved the following:

\-Anything with animals, whether that was a zoo, deer park or just ducks on a lake (especially if you could throw food on them)

\-Boat rides on the Thames, especially with commentary 

\- the Science Museum (London)

\-Waterparks

\-Watching musicals at the theatre"
"unfortunately my phones camera is busted and I'm too cheap to replace it any time soon (the rest of the phone works perfectly fine!) and it can't be repaired (bloody Apple....) so I'm without a working camera to take any sort of pictures, by they holiday or normal, for the foreseeable future"
"That'll be another No, then."
"The homeless in Cardiff don't stay in the hostels due to the drugs etc, I'd imagine it's the same in other big towns/cities"
Religious billboards everywhere? I'm either blind or oblivious. Australia is nowhere near as religious as the US
"Umm, I just kinda googled stuff and built some personal projects. After a year or so I landed my first job at a small web agency. This was well over a decade though, in simpler times. I think for someone starting today they would be well advised to take more a slightly more formal approach and do some courses, online or otherwise."
"It's not clear cut.  In general the rule is that you do not have to give notice unless the tenancy agreement says otherwise.  The clause you pasted isn't 100% clear that it wouldn't apply in this scenario.

I think on balance it would work in your favour if it got to a dispute that found its way into a court, but there is a chance a court would take the Landlord's interpretation."

Gunnars are a brand of gaming glasses that filter blue light. Pretty sure they're available in the UK.
"Love Australia and have family there so not knocking it. 

Do find the culture (not the people) very ‚Äòamerican‚Äô though. Find it very commercial and the tv channels and reporting seem far more like the US than here. 

Similarly driving rurally you could often not tell that you weren‚Äôt in the US with the same style of houses, truck stops and religious billboards everywhere. 

Obviously some good reasons for this but always find it quite off putting despite how great everything else is - definitely couldn‚Äôt live there because of it whereas I could happily live in most European countries."
"Nah, that was good - you confirmed my suspicions.  

I had a friend who bangs on about the virtues of Freecycle all the time, but she was also the type of windbag who lectured everybody on Facebook about how morally bereft they were for eating meat, then got all stroppy when her boyfriend 'accidentally'* posted a picture of their fleshy chickenfest barbeque over the weekend, explaining in small words that when she eats meat it is a ""conscious choice"" and therefore exempt from normal meat-eater criticism, before calling everybody present stupid and blocking them.  

Also, it is was always time to go home by pure coincidence whenever it happened to be her turn to get the drinks in.  Always.

Er, hypothetically that is.

They won't do anything but put me on waiting list again for months and I will have to go to a hostel
"Doesn‚Äôt show pending transactions. Some banking apps do, some don‚Äôt. The disadvantage with showing pending transactions is that sometimes the amount changes, for example if you use your card (contactless) with TfL the pending transaction showing is ¬£0.10 and gets updated to the actual fare a day later."
I've had part-worn for years and never had a problem. Would recommend.
Thank you.
Alright thanks for cleaing that up.
"When you commit to a purchase on Amazon they're really just testing you card to make sure it's still working; They only actually charge your account the money when the product leaves their warehouse. Sometimes this can then come up as several transactions depending on if you purchased things from multiple vendors on the marketplace.

It's similar to how you you can insert your card at a petrol pump, enter your PIN to agree a transaction of ""Up to ¬£100"". When you leave the forecourt with your car fully topped up it takes another day or two before you actually see the transaction hit your account.

Starling, Monzo and a few other new banks are becoming quite popular with one of the reasons being that they send you notifications the moment money is taken from your account - My phone has usually already buzzed in my pocket before the receipt has printed out of the till. 

When I purchase through Amazon/a pay at pump it comes up as a ¬£1 pound ""Holding transaction"" and then later on it adjusts itself/gets refunded and a new transaction replaces it."
If an amazon transaction is a pending transaction then what's a completed transaction? Cause I am sure I completed the purchase on amazon.
"Most police forces have their own force policy and procedures. Try and read up on that. Also make sure you know who the important people in your constabulary are. E.g. Chief constable, assistant chief constable, police and crime commissioner, they could ask you about that but if they don't it's good to name drop and show you've done research. Also it doesn't hurt to dress up for your interview, i used to invigilate police interviews and whenever people came dressed down (used to happen crazily often) the panel definitely noted it, it doesn't hurt to make an effort."
I really dont think this is every hostel mate. I mean to be expected to be pricked by needles is fucked and surely not the norm

"I wouldn't take money of people bro, thanks though"
Pop it into savings. If you need to claim UC again in the future you can use it instead of getting an advance in those first 5 weeks!
"That is true. One of the old tenants was a French guy who left without paying his last month's rent. But I guess since he left the country they couldn't do anything.

"bad advice. OP would voluntarily make himself homeless, meaning he would be crossed off the waiting list for the council flat.

Neither is the GTP. Even though it gives you qualified teacher status.
"Keep yourself to yourself. Dont tell anyone about your personal life, buy a second lock.

I was brought up in a council estate."
What things would you have to make yourself stop saying then?
It's a decision that OP has to make - stay in the hostel or make himself homeless.
"Well, amazon obviously hasn‚Äôt taken the money yet. It happens all the time, my amazon transactions have never been instant."

"Ok - I'll let you have a car ;-)

An SUV might be more comfortable, but I'd consider getting a people carrier instead, as it might be a narrower vehicle - the roads will be much narrower and more winding than you'll be used to (assuming you're American).

Generally, please be aware of traffic building up behind you and pull over to let them past when you can. Other than that - have fun!"
"Definitely sell off all unnecessary possessions, or see if you can put them in storage. I've recently started decluttering, and now the only thing that's likely to get nicked if I get burgled is my laptop or Xbox, both of which are insured. Decluttering has its own benefits quite aside from reducing anxiety about being burgled and losing all your stuff!

Smoke alarms are vital in any home, so yeah those too.

As the previous poster says though, nobody should have to live like that, so harangue the council to get moved ASAP."
It‚Äôs a but of fun and everyone is free to spend their money as they choose. There are probably things you spend money on that others would find a waste of money.
"Haha, not sure that I'd risk it to be honest."
"Personally, I would break/cut it down into smaller than bin size pieces and put some of it in my general waste over a couple of collections, along with the other general waste.
Alternatively, you could get it collected as ""bulky waste"" (for which most council provide a charged for collection service) - though I wouldn't consider it bulky."
"Sure, I'm not disputing that, just throwing it out there. Use your own common sense in that regard."
Haha good shout!

I‚Äôve been a teacher for a decade I know earn too much to leave but if I had my time again I‚Äôd never become a teacher. Too many friends who are excellent teachers are leaving the profession every year through workplace stress and it‚Äôs not getting any better.
"I'll take a few photos of interesting landscapes or landmarks and get a few pics of myself/ whoever I'm with (mostly because my nan enjoys them).

"I was waiting at a bus stop once and an ambulance as tearing down the road, full lights and sirens. It stopped right in front of where I was standing and a paramedic jumped out and gave the motorbike behind her a right bollocking for tailgating them through the traffic.

"Person A puts down the hard earned deposit and has made payments towards the mortgage. Person B comes along and moves into person A home. Person A and B decide to split up. The home is sold and person B is now entitled to equal half of the home despite prior payment and deposit by person A.

Alternatively, 
Person A uses a Tennancy agreement with Person B. Person A and B decide to split up. Person B packs his or her possesions and leaves with no stake in the home nor can they make person A homeless . Person B  are at no loss because they would have had to pay to live somewhere anyway."
