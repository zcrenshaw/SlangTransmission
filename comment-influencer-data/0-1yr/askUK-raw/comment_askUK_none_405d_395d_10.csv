I cant attest for the whole nation and every phone case shop - but in my home town they are mainly fronts for cleaning up drug money. They have low start-up costs and are a cash business mostly.

"A clear conscience is worth more than £40. Theft by finding is a crime in the UK and you can get in trouble for it: [recent example](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-39119990).

There’s probably CCTV in the shop, someone will soon realise they’re 40 quid down and it won’t be that difficult for them to work out who took it, especially if it’s your local shop. Call the cash machine company or take it to the local cop shop - you might even get it back if no one claims it. Ultimately you know it’s not yours and it could be a really big deal for the person who lost it. It’s never a bad idea to do the honest thing."
"It’s the 80s and your town’s sole industry has collapsed leaving you living in a post-industrial shithole. What do you do?

d) Keep the pit brass band going at least

e) All of the above"

"Nobody ever lost a job for being too smart

What you’ve got is correct. Smart-casual is trousers and shirt (the casual bit is no tie / suit jacket).

Jeans are not smart-casual. Expect to make a poor impression if you wear jeans.

"Some are, the same with chicken shops in my home town, however, it takes a lot of work to prove something. The shops are normally open a year max and close down/change hands. Generally speaking, if you have a good accountant and are smart, cleaning up money isn't that hard whilst being very difficult to prove.   


A chicken shop was caught laundering a lot of money locally, the rumor is that that they were forensically audited, and it was discovered that they did not purchase enough napkins to cover the volume of people supposedly being served. It takes details like this to make something stick/get warrants for a bigger investigation, which with police cuts means there is little that can be done to properly investigate."

a) Convince him to stay. It's too dangerous for him.

"&gt;why is there such a spotlight on him for any perceived wrongdoing?

"Antisemitism is based on some myths that have been going around for hundreds of years that push the idea of a Jewish elite controlling banks (Rothschild disproportionately brought up, is common), the media, the government, etc. 

In the modern day in the UK people talk about the state of Israel exerting these controls and a lot of antisemitic tropes are used to describe the actions of its government or its existence in the first place. 

This is a shame because its deserving of a lot of criticism but Palestinian solidarity movements get the well poisoned by antisemites fairly frequently.

That's how it found its way into the left, which has been a bit more (but not totally) resistant to other forms of racism. The left is instinctively anti-Elites where banks, media, government and Israel are concerned."

"Don’t do all that. This is a common theme we see from North American visitors - planning to drive around like crazy but not actually see anything. 

Having driven myself in the US/Canada, I can tell you the UK is very different. Our roads are far smaller and more crowded, making driving more stressful. 

You also put far too much in, how do you expect to do all that on Day 30? It sounds like hell.

I would strongly recommend rethinking. Some tips -

1) There is no need to do Oxford *and* Cambridge. Both are very nice, but a variation on the same theme. Pick one, and Oxford might be good as it is a little off the M4 which is the road between Bath and London. 

2) Don’t bother with Dover. 

3) Cut out Stonehenge, it isn’t very impressive and you don’t have time. 

4) Never drive into London. For example, although longer by miles, when going to Bath drive around the M25. For going into London the train from Bexleyheath is cheap and gets to the centre (Charing Cross or London Bridge) in under 30 mins

If I were you I would do something like:

* 26/27/28 - London

* 29 - drive to Bath (Saturday - no rush hour so set off ~7am to avoid traffic - it would still take 2.5-3hrs). Day in Bath, stay overnight. 

* 30 - Visit Cheddar Gorge (1hr drive from Bath) and spend much of the day there, drive to Oxford (2-2.5hrs) later afternoon and stay overnight. 

* 1 - Wonder around Oxford for the day, drive back to London early evening (2-2.5hrs to Bexleytheath)

* 2 - Either London, or short excursion out (e.g. North Kent Downs are lovely and short drive from Bexleyheath (45 min)).

* 3 - Fly home!

"Whats killing you is the lunches.

There are 2 of us and we spend about £70 a week.  When we make meals at night depending on what it is I will make extra and then that will keep us going at lunch for a couple of days.

For coffee I keep a tub on my desk, and milk in the fridge.  If you don't have a fridge bring milk in a flask

Otherwise, I'll make sandwiches.  Think about it, £100-£125 a month on luncj and the same again on coffee is nuts."

"White English here. I can only speak for myself but I've never regarded White skin as a requirement of being English, only being born or settled here. As you were born here I'd say you were English.

To answer your question, you can call yourself whatever you want. English is only an identifier, not a citizenship, so if you consider yourself English then there's nothing stopping you."
I work for the maintenance department in a hotel. I genuinely dislike you.
"IMO yes. In part because of too many people, or at least too many people who don't need to be there. A big part is frankly incompetence. Surgeries are run as separate entities, there is little centralisation. A surgery can operate how it likes within reason. The staff simple have little grasp of customer service/experience. I think there needs to be a lot more harmonisation. 

My local surgery doesn't even have bloody call waiting. Takes 2 minutes of going through all the options and then 'Sorry all operators are busy, please try again later' call terminated. 

Was talking about it at work. Pretty much everyone in my team has an issue they ought to go see a GP about. All are so disheartened by the process that they are putting it off.

"Are you sure you have enough time to do all that?

Personally I don't think there is that much to see at Dover, and though it's easy to get to from Bexleyheath in a car, it is in the opposite direction from everything else. Cambridge is similarly in a different direction.The M25 can get very slow going round London, in particular. I suppose you could do Cambridge-Oxford cross-country (about 2 hr).

"Introduce more kids to trades sooner. Invest in real trade schools. Stop undermining and dividing social class by telling kids 'thick kids will end up being a plumber and clever kids go to uni'. Germany has a fantastic approach to this.

You can see the kids in a class who really don't want to be there by the time they're about 14-15. Why force effort and resources onto them thats not sticking?"

"Do roast chicken, potatoes. Carrots and peas. Buy some gravy powder.

Buy a chicken that has the roasting time on it and has no giblets. Don't muck about with stuffing, just put it in the oven at 180C with some foil over it. Take the foil off for the last 45 minutes.

Buy potatoes that are a bit smaller than your clenched fist. Each person has three halves so four people = 12 halves = 6 potatoes. 

Peel them, cut them in half and boil them for 10 minutes. Put a roasting tin in the oven with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil or cooking oil in to heat.

After 10 minutes, drain the potatoes, takes the roasting tin out of the oven, put the potatoes in ( they will spit a bit), toss them a few times to get them coated in oil and put them in the oven. They need an hour so 15 minutes before the foil comes off the chicken.

Carrots - peel them (or just scrub them) and slice / batten whatever. They need about 15 minutes boiling (or less if you want a bit of a crunch). The water will take about ten minutes to get to the boil so factor that time in as well.

Peas can be microwaved. About 3-5 minute depending on quantity. 

Make the gravy with boiling water. Add powder to the water, spoon by spoon until it's as thick as you want it.

Enjoy. 

Everyone has variations on this, but this is pretty basic."

"I literally didn't get a job once as I went for the interview in (smart) jeans and a polo.

It was at the company I was working at at the time, where the dress code was ""completely casual"", so I was super smart compared to what I'd usually wear. All the external candidates wore suits and ties though. The interviewer's first question was ""did you think it was a good idea not to get dressed up for this interview?"" and it went downhill from there. He was a bit of a cunt though, so glad I didn't end up working for him. I now do his job at a rival company, which would never have happened had I got the job then - but I was gutted at the time."

"* Class sizes are now capped at 20.
* Teachers have 1-2 assistants depending on need.
* Teacher housing near the site will be provided in the form of flats with at least 2 rooms at (financially very) favourable conditions.
* Teachers are encouraged to provide additional courses on subjects they enjoy in the afternoon. This will increase student access to arts and literature and PE outside of regular lessons.
* Classes include more ""fit for adulting"" work like simple finances.
* University comes at an administrative fee.
* Mandatory 4 weeks of volunteering at a work place the year before GCSEs.
* Food, medicine and necessities like pads/tampons are free for every single child.
* National awards for student science and art lead to introductions to universities that excel in the field.
* Private schools loose any funding and do not participate in any of my programs.
* There is sufficient timely affordable public transport to a school available to any child in the UK.
* EDIT: Any extra hours (past 40/week) are paid at a higher rate. 

I think a big part of the school system in the UK is meant well but lacks funding. The quality of teachers will rise as soon as there is incentives to become one for people that aren't idealistic enough to deal with the current wage situation."

"Does that really help? All I remember about primary school is having to wait for less able kids to catch up. Sometimes it would take 1-2 days and we'd be left to do busywork.   
Made me fall out of love with school by the time I got to comprehensive and coasted to 7 gcse's at C and a heap of apathy. "
"It has literally never crossed my mind to think about it like that; it's always been more about revelling in the luxury of being free of financial anxieties.  I'm not sure I'll ever get used to being able to just... buy what I want without worrying about it?  Knowing that if I lost my job I'd be fine for *years* on savings? To be able to do that is such a privilege, I wouldn't want to ignore that &amp; feel I'd 'failed' because it wasn't more more more.

I started earning more than my dad ever had roundabout late 20s, and that felt like success to me.  I bought a house in my mid-30s earning less than 40k, and, assuming there's a second person adding to the household economy, that also seemed plenty to raise a family on.  60k is more than most other families in the country earn so maybe you've got some deeper inadequacy anxieties issues about your lifestyle?  It's great to have goals - if you want to earn 100k, that's your thing - but suggesting 60k is necessary to raise a family is weirdly detached from reality (imnsho)."
"It doesn’t sound like you made the wrong decision. It sounds like you made the right decision at the time, but have been unfortunate with either bad luck or side effects.

"AFAIK this would be considered discrimination - the law defines age as a [""protected characteristic""](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights), and deliberately mentions buying and renting property as something that you're protected with regards to.

As for why they're doing it? Chances are they believe younger people are more likely to cause damage, or (if it's an area with a lot of students) might not want to deal with students. But they can't discriminate solely based on age (and if they've specifically said you're too young, especially in writing, they're bloody stupid)."
