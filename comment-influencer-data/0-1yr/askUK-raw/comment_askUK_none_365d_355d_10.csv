"Well I've always been black so I have nothing to compare it to..

But I've never found race to be a factor in anything in my life."
"The inbetweeners is essentially a documentary of school in the mid 2000s, and peep show a documentary of your late 20s."
"One way you could think about is this: the life of blacks in the USA was historically tied up with civil rights, linked to slavery and its abolition. So it's already political just to be black in the USA. In the UK, the biggest influx of black people was after WW2 because we needed people in the labour market- to do all kind of jobs. These people faced prejudice and difficulties when they arrived in the 1950s, yeah, and then there were race issues in the 1970s and 1980s. However, we are not as a society especially divided by or worried about skin colour.

Yes, we have social issues with all underprivileged groups in society, and that will include young black males. And it would be silly to say that race is not an issue in the UK. However, by and large we all get on well with one another.

The UK is much smaller and densely populated than the USA- you can think of it as loads of villages, maybe. So there is a high element of local interaction, and that means people can be individuals, and also have lots of local loyalties- to your town, your region, your team etc.

In terms of ethnic groups, things have moved on from issues to do with the first wave of black people from the Caribbean and people from (or originally from) the Indian sub-continent. Since then, we have been more worried about Eastern Europeans and originally Middle Eastern minorities- that's a bit of a tl;dr, but in general black British people are pretty well integrated and people do not think that much about what skin colour they have at all.

I'm a fucking idiot mate
In my area (Cornwall) there are very few black people percentage wise. The elderly still hold some racism but in my experience racism in this country is more directed at nationality/religion rather than skin colour. 
"&gt; It can reach 250-300mm in length.

What. The. Fuck.

A *foot long* slug?! I think I'm going to throw up.

In answer to your question, no. No I have not seen a slug the size of a fucking cat."
"You're absolutely stark, raving bonkers, OP."
"Helicopter dick.

The police might talk to you but the staff definitely won't."
"Bread is always a cheap and easy staple. 50p for a loaf, and you have £4.50 left for other things.

Maybe get some jam/peanut butter. 50-99p, and some cheese, they have many kinds for £1.

That leaves you with £2.50. 
get a bag of pasta, and some cheap sauce, maybe a clove of garlic to cover up the taste of the cheap sauce.

You have enough for toast in the morning, sandwich for lunch time, and pasta for dinner.
This is better than living on tinned beans, or rice for 3 days."
"I'm mixed race (Jamaican and British). Experienced a bit of racism growing up - being called a chocolate drop, told to go back to ""my own country"", the N word a few times - but nothing major, it wasn't consistent bullying or anything just the odd idiot. Being mixed and not talking like a stereotypical black person I've also had the delight of people telling me they don't class me as black, as if I should be flattered, and thinking they can talk shit about black people in front of me and I won't mind. But that's still a minority of idiots and not a regular occurrence. I see more racism online than I ever see in real life and it's mostly aimed at Muslims now. I've never felt my race has held me back in life.

I think the whole racial divide in America is insane and can't believe it's still happening in this day and age. You have my sympathies.

Everyone exists on a scale of Mark to Jez
Yeah right Skins for sixth form. Sixth formers wish their lives were like Skins. 
"Some people use chick for any gender. Like calling someone love, or calling someone cock. "
"I have my own house, and I still do it. "
There should be a specific word for the comforting feeling one gets when reading about another persons passion for a subject you would never be interested in. I couldn’t care less about slugs but it’s really nice to see ops passion for the slimey bastards 
"Has to be on Hallowe'en itself, has to be at people's homes and has to be proper guising."
"According to someone who used to work there, the reason they do this is that one of the founders is a huge extrovert and doesn’t understand why you wouldn’t want to have a chat while shopping, so it’s pushed hard and people on trial shifts who don’t do it enough are not taken on. 

But yeah, a firm ‘Just browsing, thanks’ should do the trick. "
What is with all the sink pissers in here?
"&gt; Wales = citizens have sex with sheep

Fucking racist bullshit! We DON'T have sex with sheep. 

We make sweet love with them."
"Why didn't you just leave the hedgehog alone? I mean it got this far without you picking it up and putting it in a box for 12 hours until you get home

I'm sure your heart was in the right place but if it seemed healthy  and happy then you should just leave it be I think."
Yours best be. 
"i'm black but I live in london, so my experiences are probably a lot easier than other black people in the UK

whenever I travel outside of london to smaller villages or towns, I do get a few looks and stares. I don't think it's meant to be discriminatory or unwelcoming, but they're probably thinking ""i've never seen this guy before"" or ""what is he doing here?"". so while it does make me feel a bit uneasy, I don't think there's malice towards it, especially in towns where there's no other colours apart from white

generally the UK is more of a classist country than race as it is in the US, so a lot more of the demonisation is based on lower/working classes.

not to say that the UK isn't racist or is great when it comes to race relations, just look at the windrush debacle. black brits can be treated as second class or having to jump through additional hurdles to justify their citizenship

i kinda rambled but ehh"
"A few recent BBC sitcoms did a good job of capturing certain parts of life in the UK that aren't normally portrayed in the media that gets exported. 

1. **People Just Do Nothing** is a great portrayal of guys that run a pirate radio station in deep West London. Many more people live in the kinds of neighbourhoods depicted in People Just Do Nothing than the neighbourhoods depicted in Notting Hill, for example. It's also a really good comedy.
1. **Man like Mobeen** is similar. I used to live in one of the neighbourhoods at the core of this show and it was so spot on. You never normally see inner city Birmingham given so much attention on TV.
1. **This Country** absolutely nailed on isolated rural living. It's about two cousins that live in a town in the middle of the Cotswolds, and have a really claustrophobic life where they have nowhere to go and nothing to do. "
"&gt; Our racists are a pretty even-handed lot, in a twisted sort of way;

Yeah they're just as happy to harass white Poles as brown Pakistanis or black Nigerians. Equal opportunity bigots, they hate everyone, but they hate Muslims the most."
It's a question about pissing in sinks
A gentleman removes the dishes before pissing in the kitchen sink.
"and Fresh Meat for university life.

For me it really captured the moment you encounter private school kids lol. Having never met people from that background, it was a bit of a shock coming across super confident and rich people my age"
I wish I was as passionate about anything as you are about slugs. 
"Yeah all the time. Also bought rubber gloves in case I needed to lay an egg and push it down the plughole, but thankfully it never came to that."
"If the walk in centres are anything like normal GP practices then they will be run by partners who decide what rules the receptionists have to enforce, rather than having a standard across all practices. 

You may want to write a letter to the manager and explain your situation. That kind of feedback is useful, especially if the receptionist in question was out of line in their attitude/what they were asking for.  "
"Devonian here, with all the inbreeding in Cornwall I'm not sure they are even classed as human anymore "
"I stayed in halls where there was a sink in the rooms but the toilets were a 10 min walk away, one guy used to shit in his sink (sober) and grind it down through the plug hole, then pour bleach down. All because he was too lazy to walk to the toilet. 90% of people would piss in their sink. "
"No need to tip, this isn’t the USA. "
"They don’t say they’re ready to eat anywhere - from that info I think yes you have indeed eaten raw chicken. 

I would call 111 or similar I think. Don’t panic or make yourself throw up - get medical advice. "
On the night itself only. Anything else is just begging.
 Royle Family perfectly captures NW England in the 90s/early 00s.
"It's probably fucking furious. There it was happily going about its evening when some giant prat picked it up and imprisoned it in a box where it's going to have to wallow about in its own shit and piss when it should be sleeping in its home. 

And you are going to want to put the dishcloth and blanket straight in the bin outside when you free the beast. Half their body weight is fleas.

I swear your life could be a sitcom.

I referenced my 20s to be like 2 pints of lager and a packet of crisps and you are expecting my use of the English Language to be amazing? 
"Depending on teacher, we heard BIMDAS (with the i standing for indices) or BOMDAS mostly.

I've seen PEMDAS online too, which I think is an American term."
2 pints of lager and a packet of crisps is like my early 20s. But less tracksuits. 
"It sounds like a regional thing, like calling someone duck or chuck. Makes me think of a Yorkshire lass."
I'm so confused - how could you not tell you were eating raw chicken from the first bite?
"The receptionists are empowered as employees providing NHS services to have access to confidential information which means the rules of the practice can make them legit gatekeepers. However, they should not be asking sensitive questions in earshot of other people, there should have been an option to go and discuss in private to protect confidentiality. "
"I had bodmas. 

We also had sohcahtoa for trig, which led to a uni professor later asking in bewilderment why everybody had written it on their paper: apparently that was not the mnenomic taught forty years earlier."
The detectorists is probably the most British show out there. Really covers the sense of humour and down to earth aspects of life. Highly recommended. 
Thats crazy
Thanks Dr Nick!

Have you ever been within 100 m of a Lush? You'd have to not shower for at least a month and let dogs piss on you for your BO to overpower the ambient perfumes in there.

Or duck
"Beans are really not that bad. The tomato sauce has a bunch of sugar, but the beans themselves are very high in fibre and protein. And wholegrain brown rice also has protein, and complex carbohydrates that last all day.

OP could make a couple of tins of beans and some rice go a long way, casserole etc."
"Eh eh - calm down, calm down!"
You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her appreciate it.
"As probably ridiculous as it sounds to you all, ive never thought about how specific the US experienxe has been. Very bizare and revealing to think about"
"In this country a lot of racism is economic and aimed at people the racists think are ‘taking their jobs’ and other resources they see as inherently belonging to them (houses, healthcare, etc). Racism against economic migrants (black, south Asian and Irish) was high when these groups were first migrating here in the past, for that reason (even though we had literally invited them here as a country to plug our very real post-War labour gaps). Now there’s a similar economic racism against Eastern Europeans. 

Islamophobia is a separate and newer thing, I think, which mostly arises from fear of terrorism and racists’ inability to separate Islam and terrorism. It’s very worrying how semi-acceptable islamophobia has become and what unpleasant comments I see in open forums on local Facebook groups. "
BIDMAS for me too. When I went to Uni and everyone was talking about BODMAS I was so confused.
"We have a winner, this is absolutely vile haha"

"It's exactly 70 years for us since a famous arrival of a ship carrying Caribbean immigrants (the Windrush; 22 June 1948) to the UK. So there have been tons of exhibitions and stuff about what happened to the black people who arrived in this period- I saw one in a museum the other day. 

Basically, a lot of the stories were the same- people arrived, had hard jobs where there was a shortage after the War (e.g. on the buses and trains, in factories and hospitals)- worked like fuck- became respected in their communities and later on became pillars of those communities.

In general, that influx happened long enough ago people just treat it as 'part of the furniture.'

For us, something analogous happened in the 1970s with Idi Amin (dictator in Uganda) throwing out the Asians and we gave them the right to settle here.

Apart from the people who arrived after the war and their descendents, of course it will be a very different experience to be black but a more recent arrival from Africa - in that case one's specific political and historical experience will also be important.

These are massive generalisations coming up, but I've known lots of people from Ghana who are very happy here- there are people from Nigeria whose experiences might be a bit determined by their tribal past- for example my pharmacist is a Yoruba - people generally do not feel as familiar with Somalis (we have a number of Somali ex-refugees) though I knew some well, and one of our sporting heroes was born in Somalia. Actually- that's a good example- Mo Farah is SO much a Londoner for me- when I hear him interviewed that's what I feel about him, not whether he is white or black. I used to live in London, and I'd feel a sense of 'yay! London!' when I heard him speak. Now I have moved North to a place with strong local identity - so when he speaks I think 'Typical cocky Southern git!'

It gives me anxiety attacks to go in there sometimes. I know it's not their fault but it really pissed me off.

Small villager here. Can confirm, anyone I don't recognise gets a bit of a stare from me just because it's a small place and newcomers are noteworthy! No malice in it whatsoever. "
"Just replying here since it's the top comment.

Thanks everyone for your concern. I called 111 and I feel fine I think. I mean I felt a bit shit all day so it's hard to gauge but a doctor is calling me back soon and we'll go from there!"
"&gt; Midlands = impossible to understand the language

Not sure where you got this from. Arguably, the midlands has the most ‘average’ (for lack of a better word) accent. Except for Birmingham...but we don’t like to talk about that place.

A true stereotype about the midlands is that we don’t exist at all. At university you’re either from the north or south; there is no so called land of the middle."
Even a day early is too soon. They should be locked up.
