"Because it's not in the media often enough and no one is willing to be the person who stands up and says ""no, fuck off, leave me and my porn alone"""
I'd murder an infant for one right now
"IMO you get good KFC and bad KFC. At its worst, expect the slimy oily soggy mess you were unfortunate enough to experience. At its best, no other fast food joint in the UK comes close for crispy deep fried goodness."
"""Cheers for that, mate"" [wry grin, small upwards nod]"
"Boots, Superdrug etc. When you need certain things from there, you need them immediately! Supermarkets are the same to some extent. "
"Fries are not chips. they are different, not to always be shunned, they have their place but do not confuse them."
"I guess it depends how close you are. I wouldn't wish my girlfriend's mother a happy mother's day unless I saw her that day (i.e: I wouldn't send a message/card). If I saw her I'd say it. It's more of a thing you do to celebrate your own parents, not other people's."
"Realistically you cannot. You can potentially mitigate the risk by CCTV, PIR floodlights, high fencing, locked gates, etc, but really I'd focus on a high quality home contents insurance policy. "
"Warhammer, leave me and my massive pile of unpainted plastic crack alone."
"it is available in Subway i think, and Paul Newman's is in most supermarkets. It is not at all common though, i don't think i've ever had it."
"I shop at Lidl every week with a trip to Morrisons or Tesco usually once a month for the extra stuff I want that Lidl doesn't stock. Don't drink coffee.

My personal favourites:
Fillet steak a lot cheaper than any supermarket and tastes great, generally decent quality meat
Veg and fruit usually good 
Most of their sauces are super, but the Indian sauces with the powder in the top are amazing
Continental meats - especially if you like to buy a big continental sausage, very good value. They do a great antipasto plater.
Superb granola and oats in the deluxe range
My personal dislikes:
I personally don't like their own brand laundry stuff, even the non-bio makes me itchy (very sensitive skin). 
Don't like their haircare products or their toothpaste, for those I go to a bigger supermarket for branded stuff.
Not a massive fan of their bakery personally. Rolls are okay but I find the cookies and muffins rather mediocre. 
The only Tea I'll buy from there is Glengettie, not a massively great tea range.
Own brand hot chocolate is a bit rubbish in my opinion but I'd still drink it if there was nothing else around.

The real fun about Lidl is going in and seeing the weekly specials and coming out with all sorts of random stuff you never planned owning."
"I don't have hobbies or interests (beyond travel) that require much money, so the main one is *extremely* fancy dining.  A lot of people - mostly my parents-out-law - insist that no meal can be worth £100. They're right, it's not worth £100 to them.  But it is worth £100 to me.  I think that's how 'worth' works, right?"
"Waterstones I reckon. I know you can buy anything from amazon, kindle, audible etc etc.

There's just nothing like wandering around in a book shop. "
I am curious as to why posts like these tend to get downvoted? He's asking a harmless question about a cultural difference between our two countries in a friendly enough tone.
"Because literally everyone knows how to access porn despite the Government's efforts.

Also no one wants to go on Radio 4 to talk about how much porn they watch and how this will affect them "
"[A40, J2 - Beaconsfield Services](http://www.extraservices.co.uk/locations/beaconsfield-services/). This magnificent services has a Spoons pub, Nandos, Greggs, KFC, MaccyD, Pizza Express, M&amp;S Food + a load more. There is a nice little outdoor section"
Because people are willing to pay for it DESPITE it being 720p only.
I definitely wouldn't.
"The NHS is one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of our nation.

Shame we can't all agree not to vote for people who want it dismantled."
"See if you can get a bunch of empty boxes for really nice stuff. OLED TVs, PS4 Pros, that kind of thing. Put the boxes outside your neighbours houses, so any passing burglars think they've got stuff worth nicking.

Also, you can do what I do which is make your house look like a crack den. Never do the garden, keep the curtains shut all the time, etc."
"Not really. 

A ''I hope [name of girlfriend + siblings] have treated you on Mother's day'' should just about cover any politeness obligations. "
"Yes to the random shit. Went for my weekly shop, walked out with binoculars. You just don’t get that sort of quality shopping experience in Tesco. "
I’m afraid it’s just how the world works. You don’t need to book a full day off necessarily - you could just say you have a dentist appointment or something (obviously you can’t say this over and over).
"Home delivery. Why am I going to spend my days dicking around a supermarket(why does anyone?) when I can sit in my underpants, click a button and get it delivered to my door.
"
Almost all Britons agree they have no idea how James Corden is so popular across the pond. 
"I once paid £250 for dinner, including wine. I did not feel ripped off in any way. (Gordon Ramsay's Maze, btw)

I have paid £10 for dinner and felt ripped off, though."
"Yup, nobody wants to defend rights/privacy/etc. in the context of social taboos."
"A cleaner. 

I've worked all week and I really can't be arsed spending the time off that I do get going around the house with a hoover. My leisure time is worth far more to me than what I pay for two hours worth of cleaning. "

"Mate, with all due respect, if I start my period unexpectedly or get struck down with a migraine, I can't wait 2 hours for Amazon no matter what it sells me. "
Gloucester and there's an equivalent up North somewhere. Crazy expensive though. 
Nando’s isn’t in the same category as McDonald’s and KFC because it’s so much more expensive.

"It wouldn't be weird if you happened to be chatting to them, but they probably won't be expecting it either."
I would like to volunteer for all future recordings simply because I'm a northerner and you need to hear a variety of British accents so as hot to be disappointed.
"Woolworths. I've not been out of the house for a few years due to illness but I can't wait to finally buy some pick and mix again and browse their value range. I wonder how well that has stood up to the big supermarkets after all this time.

That and Comet, I'm in the market for a new TV with one of those 'Digital boxes' inbuilt that you don't have to use SCART leads or anything.

Wish me luck 
   "
"99% of it is opportunistic. Something valuable seen by a window and they've figured out nobody is at home. You're only really getting people stealing things that they can sell down the pub/quickly on gumtree, so it's not like anyone wants to steal a 50"" TV anymore. Other than that, if you've got a fancy car sitting on the drive and your keys are lying about somewhere visible from the letterbox - that's going to go at some point.

Alarm, doors and windows, lights on timers and vigilance - if you see anyone you don't recognise around the house, or sitting in cars, make it really obvious you've seen them and give them a proper look. 

Don't take it too far though, I was glaring at some burglar looking motherfucker for ages and it turned out it was the guy I had arranged to come take a look at the lawn. Had to pass it off like I was short sighted..."
"Is it because real news has become so depressing even the mash can’t save us?

I remember some of their stories used to make me cry with laughter...it’s not terrible now but I agree that it’s lost something."

"Having heard how much Reddit bangs on about them, I saw one a couple of years ago and was really excited to check it out, especially as I love Mexican. 

It was honestly the most bland, stodgy overpriced shit I think I've had from a takeaway. There was nothing spicy at all, just generic tomato sauce and tasteless cheese. 

Dunno if ours are different to in the US, but I really hope so as if that gives them all the shits as much as they say it does then they have some real issues. "

"I'm in the process of saving up £20,000 to pay for my two boy's bar mitzvah parties. Yup, £10k fancy party for a 13 year old.

"Argos. I love having a shop that I can reserve things online and guarantee being able to pick it up within minutes, with such a huge range too. It'd be a shame to lose it."
"Mix it up with annual leave, doctor's/dentist appointment, calling in sick, working from home, etc"

"Slow/Late/None payers. Bane of all small business. I chase the difficult payers at my company, so have a bit of experience with this.

Is the client a commercial entity or a consumer? 

If it is a commercial entity (i.e another business) OR if the work you did for the client was for a profit making activity. Then I would suggest engaging a B2B Debt collection company. All the costs and fees you might incur (which should be less than £100) will be added on to the money owed to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it is a consumer - then things are a bit trickier. You'll probably need to do the letter before action and then escalate it to the small claims court. 

&amp;#x200B;

For fullness of advice. Worth also looking at your own business practices. Generally speaking I always aim to get 50% of the money upfront before the work starts.

"Getting on:
----------------
Wait at the bus stop
When you see the bus you want hold out your hand to signal it to stop
Get on the bus, ask for a single (one way) or return to wherever you want to go.
Bus driver will say how much
Usually you pay with cash, but not in London as it's contactless only.
If you don't know exactly where you want to get off its ok to ask the driver, they'll often tell you the name of the stop or call it out for you
Take your ticket from the machine when it spits out
Take a seat anywhere that's not marked for specific purposes
Normal etiquette is not to sit next to anyone if there are still places you could sit by yourself

During the ride
---------------------
If someone gets on and needs your seat more than you then offer it to them

Getting off
----------------
When you hear the stop you want or see where you want to get off press the red button
When the bus stops promptly leave
Say thanks to the driver

Think that's about it"

"Games Workshop. I buy all my grey plastic online now, but I like popping in to get tiny overpriced paint pots when I'm in town. It's nice to see the models on display in the windows (so I can feel depressed about my own efforts) and the kids inside playing a physical game face-to-face. "
Yeah I'm not too sure. I really thought ranch was a universal thing. I honestly thought my buddy was messing with me.
