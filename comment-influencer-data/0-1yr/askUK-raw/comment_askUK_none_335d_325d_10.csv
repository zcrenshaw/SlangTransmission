"&gt;	I put it on facebook marketplace for £50 more 

You just invented capitalism.

Capitalism cares not for antiquated things like love and loyalty."
Gigs and pubs used to smell like smoke instead of stale piss and dried larger.
"&gt;I did say it's for a build i'm considering doing in the near future (this was a lie)

This is where it becomes a bit of a cunt move

If you don't say anything then it's fair game I guess, but you never know his thought process might've been, oh it'll be nice to sell it on the cheap to someone who's building a PC rather than for someone to make a profit.

Basically if you knowingly lie to someone then yeah you've taken the piss a little bit

Out. Anywhere out and away.
Complain! Tell your managers! Fuck those people who are making your life hard! 
"It’s kind of mellowed now but it’s hard to overstate how quickly the smell of actual pub was unmasked in the months after the ban. I think places learned about open windows and fabreze but it wasn’t a smell, it was a *stench*."
"Lots of places were no-smoking, so pre-ban it it wasn't like the 70's or anything with people smoking in your average work place or random shops.

Lots of small changes have come with it, such as office workers being often pushed further and further from the premises. Used to be common to walk through a crowd of smokers to get in somewhere, but that's largely gone.

Restaurants had smoking areas, even family ones. Which is like have a pissing area in a pool.

But, by far, the biggest change is being able to go out to a pub, bar or club without reeking of smoke. Hard to explain if you missed it, but as a non smoker it was fucking awful"
"&gt;So just how popular is Always Look On the Bright Side of Life?

If you whistle the first part of the tune in any location, at any time, somebody else will whistle the second part back.

&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if it is true considering how British people act about the things wrong with [life]

I think that's very true, it's a very unique aspect of British culture to moan in a jovial and silly way about the boring and mundane aspects of life, but it's not inherently a negative act, it's just a social protocol to complain about the weather (for example) as it's a neutral topic that doesn't risk awkwardness.

Moaning is just a simple way of making small talk with somebody you don't know well enough to actually engage with on a personal level, whereas in the US a shop keeper might ask how you are and about your day, that would be pushing it a bit here - because the risk of awkwardness would be somebody replying ""I've had a shit day, my cat died"" and there's just no non-awkward answer for that. Fuck that, talk about the weather instead. "
"To be honest, you’ll probably more likely experience racism in Northern Ireland than in London."
"Flipping stuff like this is normal, his loss he wanted a quick sale. "
"You’ll have a barcode or square QR code. There’s a glass reader on the barrier like a self-scan checkout. Put your phone or printout on there and then the gates will open.

"They are definitely trying to dodge tax. It's a legal requirement to protect your deposit for most standards tenancies, so I'd either avoid them or if you must do everything officially because they sound like they will screw you over.

"
Yes. Just be careful with office relationships. If something goes wrong it might make working there uncomfortable or hard.
"Pretty popular, everyone knows the tune, and it is quite common at funerals, I've only been to 2 so far and it played at one of them.

Funerals in the UK aren't really exaggerated somber affairs. Most people I imagine are thinking when making funeral arrangements, I'm already going to be fucking dead I don't need to make people even more sad. All I'd want is for the people who turn up is to remember the good times, have a little laugh, little cry, go round the pub afterwards, get sloshed, and then get on with their lives."
And some of us are now silently hating OP because of it..
It's pretty much just a room full of slot machines and a few other gambling games. There's staff there to give change and serve free tea for the punters. A lot of the regulars spend their whole day in there which is why you don't often see people go in and out.
"With respect, if you need to ask then you're not ready to start a small business. Put it in an ISA until you have a proper use for it.

"Over 290 languages are spoken as first languages in London - more than any other city in the world. No-one's going to notice another black face. 

You'll get more criticism about your trump-infested country than your melanin concentration. Also the Hipster thing. "
"As a non-smoker, it was shit to go out to a club/pub. You'd come home stinking of smoke, sounding and feeling like you had a 30-a-day habit yourself. Much better after the ban in my opinion. 

When the ban came in there was a bit of kickback from the smokers I knew at the time, but most adjusted pretty readily to going to designated areas, and some quit altogether (they were mainly 'social smokers' though) "
"Yes, report to 101 with the numberplate, time, location, and tell them what happened, and that you felt intimidated. 

It's worth reporting even if you didn't feel personally intimidated, because a bunch of other people may have been in a similar situation with this person so the more people reporting it, the better. "
Yeah the immediate aftermath was pretty disgusting. Everyone had to learn you couldn't just fart openly anymore too. It was a dark time.
"Nowadays, these sorts of things are taken seriously.

Racism and islamophobia are unacceptable and we now have comprehensive laws relating to hate crime- to crimes that are aggravated by the fact they deal with protected characteristics.

As your first answer says, report what has happened to your manager. 

I am very disappointed by this story; as the periodic racism threads in this sub show, I always find myself the one who is defending the good conduct of traditional and rural white English people and communities towards non-white British people, based not only on my own experience, but that of the hundreds of other non-white people I have known well through my life.

However- I would also say- are you a quiet and reserved person? One of the sad things about social life is that more extrovert and charming people get a better deal on the whole. If you are reserved, it is more likely that unkind people make fun of you.

Would you be able to challenge the cruel person directly? Would you be able to go up to her and have a quiet word? To say that the sorts of things she is syaing are not funny, not a joke, are offensive, and make you feel less welcome? Badness is often thoughtlessness, not evil.

I am old by reddit standards, and when I was young, it was taken for granted that immigrants (I was not, but my parents were accidental immigrants- they were here and then they found they could not return) would assimilate into the native culture. I grew up expecting to become British, well, English really. I was already an adult for some years before multi-culturalism came along.

In that context, I did expect to have to try harder, if you like, to overcome the initial resistance towards 'the Other.' I did not hold it against people if their first impressions of me were wrong, and I did feel it was also up to me to make some effort.

I think you could also make a judgment as to what extent this ringleader is a nasty person and a bully and spiteful, or more just a silly person who has not thought through the life experience of others.

"Even if they're too polite to say it, trust me: they'd rather have the cash than a present."
Better yet are the ones that go 35 in a 40 then continue going 35 in a 30. Being a slow and fast arsehole is pretty impressive
"No. The guy on FB is a moron.

&amp;#x200B;

My mate did the same to me once. Bought a bike off me for £250. Think he sold it shortly after for £300. I wanted the quick sale. He was happy to wait a bit and get more. Fair play."
"Til the day I die I'll never understand these cunts who randomly target somebody and then act like that when confronted.

Mate of mine got shot with a paintball gun from a car, was less than impressed and told them so. They turn around, chase him down before losing quite badly in the ensuring fight.

Next thing he knows they've called the police and he gets arrested further down the road. He didn't get done (though neither did they) but the mind just fucking boggles at the mentality. There was no reason whatsoever for their paths to ever cross.

Definitely chat to the police - back in the day this was the sort of thing they'd pop around for a chat for, even if they can't prosecute, it's ripe for a bollocking in front of your boss/Mrs/whoever. Dunno if they have the time now though."

"I used to have a routine when I got in from a club (and wasn't mortal). I'd take all my clothes off and put them straight in the washing machine, I'd go in the shower, and shampoo all over, I'd get out and blow my nose and use damp ear buds. Along with brushing teeth and tongue, it did the trick if I didn't want to wake up smelling like fag ash the next day. 

It's definitely something that's going to be hard to explain to the next generation of yoot how normal it was at the time. "
"Search Gumtree for people selling tumble dryers locally, pick one and arrange to view. Upon arrival ask to test the item with your regular load. Dry your clothes. Then make an excuse not to buy the item. Repeat as often as necessary.

Might be worth keeping a note of who you've done so you can avoid the embarrassment of turning up at the same place twice."
"Probably considered as unnecessary and almost forgotten war in the US because you joined in *the year before the war ended.* And roughly 300 US military personnel were killed... unlike the millions from everywhere else. That probably goes some way to explaining the American attitude towards it.

Some here might say it's forgotten or nobody talks about it, but that isn't wholly true. There's nobody alive now who was a serving soldier in WW1. And most of the people who were alive then are dead. The only people of that time period left are people who were children when it happened. So it's passing out of living memory. And it is overshadowed by WW2 a great deal because that was more recent; and Hitler was a 'bigger evil' than our foes in WW1. 

But it did touch the lives of most of our families - for example, my great great grandfather died at the Somme. My great-grandfather was 7 at the time. It definitely left him with issues and I think that came out in how he raised his children, which had a knock-on effect for how his children raised theirs. 

I do know how WW1 began, and a number of the battles that took place, how it ended and how the Treaty of Versailles, which was a result of WW1, ended up being one of the causes of WW2. I know that the people who were involved in WW1 and survived were so profoundly affected by it that it was one of the reasons Britain as a whole pursued a policy of appeasement towards Hitler through the 1930s, because the first war was so terrible they couldn't face a second.

Also, the poppies we wear as part of remembrance come from the fields in which our men lie dead. 
*In Flanders fields the poppies blow*
*Between the crosses, row on row,*
*That mark our place...* 

And the main poem that is read at Remembrance services across the U.K. also commemorates the sacrifice of our soldiers in that war.
*They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;*
*Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn*
*At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them.*

It was called the Great War before WW2 occurred. Not because it was brilliant, but because it was so terrible. It was never forgotten by the people who lived through it, and it is our duty to remember it - because those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it."
Desperate people and shattered dreams.

Another difference that no-one has mentioned yet is that you can now go to gigs without your clothes and skin having small holes burned in them from assholes smoking while dancing and flailing a lit cig everywhere. I've still got a scar from one of them where I was too drunk to notice that they were resting their cig on my arm (accidentally).

"Don't piss where you eat unless you're REALLY sure it's very mutual.  If she likes you she likes you, four years isn't that big of a hurdle.

However, this is an age gap that has a few attached issues.  She may be further along the road in terms of independence, both emotionally and financially.  She may already be thinking in terms of family (not all of us ladies do at that age, but some do, and that might not be something you're ready for at 21, so beware of that one).  She may be a bit more domestically organized, so making sure your place is nice and clean (with toilet roll, clean towels, food in the fridge, an absence of anything that /r/neckbeardnests has to offer etc) is a good idea.

If you are really sure you want to go ahead with this, ask her out on a nice proper date and have the conversation.  This will at least show her that you're mature enough to treat this seriously and aren't just messing about.

Good luck!"

"It's the [8th most popular funeral song](https://www.co-operativefuneralcare.co.uk/arranging-a-funeral/organising-the-day/funeral-music/2016/).

The thing to realise is that it's not an inherently cheerful song. I mean it has a happy tune and a positive outlook, but ultimately it's about life being rotten. It starts of entirely negatively ""some things in life are bad...""

It is very much an aspect of British stoicism. It's sympathetic to misery and hardship, so you can play the song in sad circumstances, but it also gives permission not to feel so bad. The simple chorus invites people to join in, and gain a sense of togetherness. The nature of the song (being part of one of the most fondly remembered British comedy films) reminds us that we can be happy. "

"Firstly, the company you bought the item from is liable as they chose to use that delivery service. Contact your bank and ask to raise a dispute for goods not received. The bank will need to submit a “request for copy”. This means the delivery company HAS to give them a copy of the signature. The bank will probably refund you directly right away while the whole thing is investigated.

"You were 7 when the smoking ban came in...now I feel really old!

I remember when you could smoke on the London Tube, before the Kings Cross fire disaster that rightly put an end to that. I also remember my school in the 80s had a smoking room for teachers. 

I was smoking in the mid 90s and you couldn't just smoke anywhere. All shops were smoke free and so were most offices, although we did have an inside area at one company I worked at. Most people still went outside to smoke a lot. 

Pubs were full of smoke. It wasn't even pleasnt for smokers to be in them a lot of the time.

You could smoke at stations and had smoking carriages on trains but couldn't smoke in the rest of the train, except on my local route, where you could smoke where they stored bikes and luggage standing up. I do remember going to a cinema and being able to smoke. You could smoke on the top of a double decker bus at the back.

Airports all had smoking lounges and in fact, Heathrow Terminal 3 still has one. Most were phased out though even before the ban.

Restaurants had smoking or non-smoking areas. Increasingly, fewer and fewer restaurants allowed smoking though. The same with hotels.

By the time the ban came, really smoking had already been cut down to pubs, train stations, the occasional restaurant and that was it really. We were already used to huddling outside together to smoke. 

The worst thing for me was how terrible pubs smelled without the smoke hiding it. Those carpets can't have been washed for about 20 years in most of them. Pubs just stunk of wee and stale beer. Pubs are a lot cleaner now, not only because of the lack of smoking but the cleaner carpets! "
Ahh yes Mr 40 who does 40 on a national where the roads are straight and visibility is fine who'll then do 40 through a town when schools are coming out. He's a prick and has a lot of twin brothers and sisters.
"There is a burger van in Broughty Ferry, Dundee in Scotland, they usually put some fairy lights up and have some plastic chairs for customers only.

I just whistled it to my husband across the sofa. He did not respond. I think I should divorce him. 
"Out of interest, if the sale was presumably already done, and didn't change the price why on Earth would you decide to randomly lie about what you were doing with it?!?!

Obviously you know what went on with the transaction and I didn't so fair enough

Just, no one likes being lied to. I could imagine that most of the anger about you flipping might either be exacerbated or caused by the fact you misrepresented what you were doing with it after.

"On the day the smoking ban came into effect in Scotland, I went into Shakespeare's on Lothian Road in Edinburgh with a couple of other people. I lasted about ten seconds before having to leave - the smell was so fucking bad, I was choking to keep down from vomiting everywhere.

"As a non-smoker who worked in a pub, it was amazing.  I no longer came home stinking and coughing.  There was one disadvantage though.  The smell of smoke in a nightclub masked the true smell which is a nightmarish mix of stale piss, lager, sweat and ""sex smell""."
