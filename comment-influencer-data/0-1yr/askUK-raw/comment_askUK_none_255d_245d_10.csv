"It was bad as it allowed councils to sell off social housing homes to the tenants (at a massive discount) but did not allow those councils to use the raised funds build more social housing.   
Thus, social housing stocks depleted and former social houses were sold on or used to let out which equals a continually rising private rental market.   
Which we why have a housing crisis. "

Did you report the vandalism to the police when it happened? Legally your recourse would be to sue the hoodlums for the cost of the damage they caused, but without insurance it'll be a DIY job.

For the car itself - damage sounds mostly superficial. Tyres wear out and need replacing regularly anyway, headlights can easily be replaced, windscreen can be done by a mobile company...

"1.) Councils were forced to sell off housing stock at a massive discount and weren't allowed to use funds raised to build new council houses.
2.) Nothing was built to replace them.
3.) It was bribery to buy votes for the Tories from traditional Labour voters.
4.) It meant a lot of people ended up with mortgages they could barely afford and tied them to banks, which they hadn't been previously.
5.) A lot of the houses sold off were due to be refurbished or rewired at the govt's expense when the first round of RTB happened. This meant the councils were able to shirk their duties and pass the expense on to the new homeowners. "

"In theory it's a great policy - it allows people who would normally have difficulty saving for a deposit to gain access to the housing ladder (buying homes at a discount), and it allows councils to offload old housing stock (which becomes more and more expensive to maintain **and** gradually becomes outdated as family dynamics change). 

But, as has been pointed out, the downside was that local councils at the time (and since) were not allowed to reinvest this funding into new housing stock - so the amount of council-owned housing diminished quite dramatically. 

Another problem was that former council tenants were able to quickly sell their new houses onto property speculators, who - even though they were buying at a higher price, were still effectively getting a hefty discount. The result was a massive growth in slumlords buying low-end property and then renting it out at vastly inflated rents. 

(which they were increasingly able to do because of the diminishing availability of council housing...)

Like a lot of Thatcher's policies, there was a lot of short-term economic gain in exchange for long-term economic problems. But by the time the problems really came home to roost, she was long gone.

"Just to clarify, you don't have GCSEs or you just never picked up the letter/certificate?  If it's the latter then you can find out how to obtain proof of them [here](https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate).

You need to decide whether to pursue education or employment.  This is quite a personal decision so I can't really weigh in much here, but it's largely a case of 'money now' vs 'more money later / a potentially more interesting job'.

If you want to go for employment then follow these steps.

1. Obtain proof of your GCSEs and make sure you have proof of identity.  We're talking birth certificates, bank statements, provisional driving licence.
2. Volunteer somewhere.  If there's nothing that spring to mind or special causes you particularly care about then charity shops basically always need more people.  This will help alleviate the negative effect of having a huge gap/nothing on your CV because it shows you're not completely unreliable, and actually capable of doing *something* on a regular basis.  It'll also help you build a bit of confidence/self-esteem while getting more used to interacting with strangers and sticking to a routine.  Many/most places will cover your travel expenses if you have any.
3. Write a CV, you need one.  Point 2 will give you something to actually put on it.  If your local jobcentre isn't shit (but they probably are) then they should help you make one, failing that there is loads of advice online.
4. Apply online for basically every entry-level vacancy you can find, and hand out printed CVs downtown if you're somewhere not too out of the way.  Sign up with every local temp agency you can find, and check in with them if you don't hear anything for a while.  Treat this as your job, spending a solid block of time doing it every day.  You really can't afford to be picky at this point.  get *any* job first, and then you can think about getting a *decent* job.  Don't get discouraged when most employers don't respond, this is normal.
5. Eventually, you'll be offered an interview.  You'll be awful at interviews initially (everyone is) so consider the first one 'practice'.  Your goal isn't to get the job, it's to improve your interview technique.  This means there's no pressure at all to perform well, so long as you figure out at least one way to do a little better next time.  Send them a followup email thanking them for the interview and asking for feedback.
6. Eventually, you'll be offered a job.  The traditional answer at this point is 'yes'.  Try not to answer incorrectly if you want the job, you usually just get the one shot at this particular question.
7. Continue for 60-80 years.
8. Die.
9. ???

If you want to go for education then follow these steps.

1. Obtain proof of your GCSEs and make sure you have proof of identity. We're talking birth certificates, bank statements, provisional driving licence.

2. You can either take A levels (2 years) at a college or an Access to Higher Education Diploma (usually 1 year, you can do it part-time over 2 or more years though, worth considering as a middle ground if you want to earn a bit through a part-time job at the same time).  If you call your local college then they should be able to give you all the information you need.

3. Consider volunteering while you wait to start, it'll still benefit you in all the ways I listed above while helping to ensure you don't fall back into a funk.

4. Do an actual degree.  Basically any STEM subject is a good idea these days and you mentioned that you're quite into tech.
5. Get any job.
6. Get a job in your field.
7. Continue for 60-80 years.
8. Die.
9. ???

" &gt; What do I even put if I have literally nothing? Will any employer look past the blank past 7 years and my nervous disposition?

Nope, all employers worth their salt and not on the grift will ask you about this and you need to be prepared to offer them a reasonable explanation. You will also have to explain that your mental health issues are no longer of a major concern and you will not need to take regular time off for ""MH days"". 


I'd advise you go and book an appointment with your local branch of the Citizens Advice Bureau. They will be able to help you infinitely more than we can on here, and even provide referrals to things like on going counselling for your social anxiety issues (the best cure for which, is actually exposure therapy which you'd be doing anyway in applying for jobs and going for interviews).

"&gt; What’s the deal with a council-house being for-life anyway?

The original purpose of council housing was to provide decent long term homes in an era when most people rented for much or all of their lives, and the private sector were manifestly failing to deliver (sound familiar?).

The notion that social housing is only for the poorest is more recent and a lot of it stems from the Thatcher era reforms which lead to massive shrinkage of the council housing stock."

"At the very least we'd be able to organise a piss up in a brewery, so we're beating the current lot already. "
"Councils aren't allowed to refuse to sell a property to long-term tenants. 

They literally are forced to sell. That was the whole point of the policy - tenants have a **right** to buy the property in which they have been living for five years or more (was three years at the time the law was introduced), and they get a discount on the property when they do so. 

At the time the policy was introduced, 6m tenants qualified, and ultimately 1/3 of these took advantage. "

"&gt;This meant the councils were able to shirk their duties and pass the expense on to the new homeowners.   
  
TBF, those same people just got sometimes enormous discounts on their house, so I can't say I feel too bad for them. If they wanted the council to maintain and refurbish their house then they should have kept renting - my parents bought their house with the maximum discount, but they ended up spending a small fortune on new windows, doors and a bathroom, but that's the price of ownership. If the council concealed problems from tenants though, who then found out about them only after buying the house, then that's a different kettle of fish."
