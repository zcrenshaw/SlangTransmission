"Drop your voice down a few decibels, be prepared to receive a bit of a ribbing about recent politics (and preferably dish a bit out in return), and look into the public transport deals available to you as a foreigner.

Try to get out of London for at least a week or two and see some of the rest of the UK.

Don't go carrying knives around.

People are basically just people wherever they are, you'll probably put your foot in your mouth a few times, but few will hold it against ya :)

When Prince Harry welcomes you off the plane, bow/curtsy as applicable and remember that it's considered rude to turn your back to royalty.

[These are chips](https://i.imgur.com/tCG00Md.jpg) and [these are crisps](https://i.imgur.com/sgeFoST.jpg).  This is not negotiable.  Also the letter U exists, get used to it.

We don't talk on the London Underground.  I'm not entirely sure why, we just don't.

A lot of our food (even brands you'll be familiar with) is less sweet than that found in the US.  You might be surprised by liking something you dislike over there or vice versa.  Oh, and free drinks refills aren't really a thing here, you pay for a cup of coffee, you get a cup of coffee.

You don't have to tip, but it's very unlikely to cause offence if you do.

DO NOT ENTER THE VEHICLE UNTIL THOSE WANTING TO LEAVE HAVE ALREADY DONE SO!  This is a glassing offence."

"He’s only unpopular in comparison to his mum and children. I think it’s because he got a bit too involved with politics, is rabidly pro-alternative ‘medicine’ and the fact he cheated on Diana, but she cheated on him too."

"It is to do with off licencing laws, chips are a meal (apparently) and a salad is a side order."

This should be handed to people as they get off the plane!  Very well put.
"There are some good answers here, but some additional points:

1) Embrace the fact you're in a new country and place. But recognise this means ""different"" too. Prepare yourself that things are not going to be the same as at home and sometimes that will be frustrating and can be upsetting. Mentally prepare yourself and learn the phrase: ""That's how things are done over here.""

2) There are many great things about the UK and quite a lot that sucks. We know this, but it's also where we live so don't go on about it. Thorpe Park is not Disneyland and we know that already. 

3) Despite any impression you'll get elsewhere, we kinda like American enthusiasm. But make sure it's genuine and don't fake it. And don't whatever you do use the word ""quaint"", it's provocatively patronising.

4) There are ignorant, stupid and small minded people in every country of the world. The UK is no exception, and biting your tongue around ill informed notions (especially political ones) is often going to be a good idea. 

5) Avoid doing that thing that a lot of new arrivals do and constantly compare your home country with the UK. Especially if it begins with ""Back home, it doesn't work like this..."" Even if it's not something bureaucratic and is just explaining what ""lay away"" is... To be honest, we don't care. 

6) Be curious and be a pleasure to be around. Travel only broadens the mind for those whose minds can be broadened.

7) Seek out friendly fellow ex-pats but don't be a clique.

8) Be prepared for drinking, swearing and a very dry sense of humour. Don't be puritan but don't feel you have to be a part of that UK mindset too. I can say to my friend at the pub ""Morning wanker"", but that doesn't mean you have to as well nor does it mean you shouldn't be aware that I'm being friendly. Oh and remember the UK is dark and often cold and cramped. This is why we drink, so we're also good at it. Don't feel you need to keep up. Oh, and check out Kate Fox's guide to pubs to understand the concept of rounds. 

Edited to add: [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/aacx0n/this_shop_probably_had_a_bad_experience_with) would be a good example of what I'm talking about vis a vis the sense of humour. 

9) Check out /r/casualUK. It's highly indicative of what the country is like.

10) There is a reason the UK is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Make sure you find out what it is. You're young, you're travelling to another continent and should return with an understanding of a similar, but different culture. This is a good thing so be excited! "

"\&gt; Builds naval empires and trading routes for spice trade

\&gt; ""white people don't like spices""

On a more serious note, it's a pretty silly thing to say. Of course people season their food. I can't think of many savoury meals that don't have at least salt and pepper, but then there's also shit like parsley, coriander, thyme, mustard, etc, etc, etc. that white countries use very extensively in their food.

To say it's less spicy than, say, Caribbean or Indian food is obviously correct, but that's because thy have more of those kinds of plants, so no shit."
"Definitely not.

My wife would be pissed."
"Oh yes, we had that one as well."

"I'd say the key would be to find something you enjoy, rather than trying to make things you hate enjoyable. Find a local badminton club and go as a pair - or squash 1v1. Maybe you'll find these fun. Like video games, you can play theses sports for fun or get competitive if you want to."
"The reason is actually to do with safety. In the UK and Europe, mains voltage is 230V (plus or minus a bit) referenced to earth. In older houses, the only thing protecting you against a lethal shock was a fuse - 30/32A for a standard ring main socket. It only takes a fraction of this to kill you (3mA), so clearly it was very unsafe to have anywhere near a bathroom where wet hands massively increase the risk of a shock. An electric shock occurs when you connect yourself between mains potential and ground - the most serious of which travel across your chest and interfere with your heart muscle.

Shaver sockets contain a transformer which isolates the mains supply from earth. The voltage is the same, or 115V for the centre-tapped output. If you were to touch one of the two output pins, then you would not get a shock - you're connected to ground, but the output side of the transformer isn't. So no current would flow, and you'd remain unfried. The transformer can only carry a relatively small amount of current (enough to run a shaver or toothbrush), so is designed to stop you from plugging in normal devices, such as a hairdryer. Of course, you could still get a shock if you touched both pins at the same time, but it would be localised to your finger.

Some would argue that more modern circuit breakers (e.g. Residual Current Devices) negate the need for a transformer-isolated socket. However, most domestic RCDs are designed to trip at 30mA, i.e. ten times what will kill you."
Probably because in percentage terms it's quite big. It's rarely been a thing for people to try to cross on a boat - that's why thousands are in Calais trying to hide in lorries. I think people see it and it reminds them of the Mediterranean and they don't want the situation to end up like it was there at its peak.
Mid 2019? You run a very good risk of not being able to move here because of brexit. If a deal isnt made between now and April you don't have freedom of movement.

When someone asks where you are from say America, not Bumfuck Texas or similar. Don't assume an English centred view as you will meet people from everywhere and it's only polite to ask them where they are from but don't assume.

"I made a few grand from matched betting in the space of about 9 months, but then it slowed down and couldn't be faffed to do it any more. I didn't pay for any helping sites (could maybe have made a bit more if I did) because I saw it very much as a hobby thing, and I enjoyed the 'numbersness' of it.

If you want to make the most of matched betting, it really helps if you've got a decent pot (a few hundred quid) to get started. Also - make sure you've got a good spreadsheet with all the odds calculations and profit losses/gains to keep track.

I'll probably do it again this year. My mum has said I can do it on her behalf/use her details/card accounts to get 'new customer' offers' and we'll split the profits.

"I would like to pick up on  (2) as a further point for OP - We Brits thrive on taking the piss out of ourselves. It’s a national past-time. Everything is just a bit shit, including ourselves, and a lot of our humour is based around acknowledgement of that fact. In fact, we often kind of celebrate the “bit shit”. 

We tend to be self-depreciating and anti-establishment. This is in contrast to the proud, patriotic, celebratory vibe that often runs through US culture. We don’t pledge allegiance  to anything, and “God save the Queen” is a fucking stupid song. One of our newest tourist attractions at Christmas was a decorated rain shelter/tunnel in a shitty supermarket car park. Here lies the basis for a lot of British humour."
"In primary school this is, we had a massive field behind the school which we played on during summer. One side was housing, the other fenced off to a road and the other fenced off to a foresty area.

Anyway, there was this old wooden beer-garden table in foresty bit for some reason, all overgrown with plant life. It was barely visible. 

Somebody made up that if you stared long enough, a ghost would appear sitting at the table and would follow you when left school, kill you, and take your body back to where the table was.

Sounds dumb but was quite terrifying at the time. "

"When I was younger, shyer and more introverted things like this would happen to me. So here's what I eventually figured out.
1.) Find things in common with people. Build bridges. Make the effort to find common ground. People are just people regardless of age, they were your age once and aren't aliens just because they're older. You have loads in common you just dont know it. Yet.
2.) Smile more, have more welcoming body language. Seem keen to help/be involved. Quiet but friendly is way better than just quiet.
3.) Ask for help or guidance even if you know what you are doing. People love to talk about themselves, show off what they know and act the part of a mentor. This technique is a great ice breaker and bond builder. You may find ppl take you under their wing.
4.) Don't be a blank slate that people can't get to know. Don't be the quiet lad. Be the lad who follows this sport, does this at the weekend, had that funny thing happen to them, is hoping to go on to do this, is saving for a holiday at that place etc Give them an understanding of who you are."

Only massive faux par I’ve seen that I want to mention - talking about guns. We basically, almost unanimously, think America’s ideas about guns are monumentally stupid. I once heard an American girl on a train saying “can you imagine what a country would be like without guns? The danger we’d be in.” Legit. She said this on a train... in England... so it shouldn’t have been difficult for her to imagine what that’s like. But I digress. Sorry if you love guns, we don’t. I didn’t say anything to her because....

We don’t call people out on their shit in public - we tut, often silently, and shake our heads.

London is a deeply inclusive city, so you’ll be alright. 

It’s huge. It takes a long time to get around and you’ll probably end up living in a little pocket of London - that’s no bag thing - we all do it - but accept as many invitations to weird and wonderful places as you can and see as much of it as you can. I came here 4 years ago thinking I’d be here for a year - didn’t want to like it - now I love it. I’ll be here until we all burn in the fires of Brexit.

Crap, you’ll be here for Brexit. Brexit is our Trump. Lookup a YouTube vid or something to explain it. Tl:dr, a lot of the country wanted it (ALOT! Ha! 51.4% - voice of the people lol - kill me) London really really didn’t. March 29th we’re gonna be pissed off. "
"Secondary school, 90s...

An Indian/Pakistani (idk) female English teacher had done porn, lots of porn, and preferred anal. Folk ***swore*** that they'd found a video of her in their dad's secret porn stash but they couldn't bring it in because then their dad would know they'd been snooping through his stuff and they'd get smacked. They never could agree on the scene though, so obviously it was because she'd done several.

A female science teacher had fake wooden tits. Not that she had implants or anything like that, but literally was flat-chested really but wore a large wooden prosthesis, 'which was true because if you look closely her boobs never jiggle even though they're big'. Folk ***swore*** they'd seen it fall out once while they were in detention, and she'd paid them fifty quid to not say anything.

The Ten Men Club was a gang of older students who were the hard kids in school, the hardest, the coolest, the best, named so because each one was 'ten men'. They were so hard that they often went to our 'rival' secondary school to beat up their sixth formers. Supposedly this other school had a similar club that would stop by and beat ours up. It was all about school and personal honour and whatnot. Yup, my quaint Yorkshire secondary school was embroiled in gang warfare in the early-to-mid 90s.  
If you wanted to join the Ten Men Club you had to go stand in a certain spot in the school, which changed periodically, and shout ""I'm ten men"" ten times at the top of your voice, then at some point over the next few days, if they thought you were worthy, they'd contact you and you'd have to fight three of them one after the other. If you handled yourself well enough you could join them the next time they went on an invasion.  
Obviously they only took the hardest, if they thought you were only nine men you weren't worth shit and they'd ignore you. Secrecy was a must else the cops would know who was part of it, so this was all done on the down low and they'd not test you in public. No one else would know if they tested you, no one would know if they took you, and they'd kick the shit out of you if you failed and blabbed so obviously no one ever knew the true details, but some folk ***swore*** they were part of it but don't tell anyone or they'd have to beat you up.  
Obvious bullshit, but there ***was*** this one time when something happened with kids from another school who did show up at ours and started a fight with some kids, but no one ever knew what happened. The Ten Men Club rumours ceased after that.  
Obviously the cops found out and put a stop to it all. Obviously.

Watch out, kids, the drama teacher's a pedo! Be careful, don't be alone with them! Or was that the PE teacher? Or the biology teacher? No, it was the maths teacher! Though it could have been the other English teacher - had it been the porn English teacher no one would have minded cos she was well fit. Folk ***swore*** whichever teacher it was, varied per term, had touched them but backed off when they'd knocked him out.

The teachers all had massive sex orgies in the staff room, that's why kids weren't allowed in. Folk ***swore*** they'd snuck in and watched without being seen. It's true! Honest!

Junior school, mid-to-late-80s...

This one kid climbed a flag pole all the way up to the top, did a shit on the very top, then slid down and got his nut sack caught on the little sticky-outy metal bit you'd wrap the flag rope around and it ripped his balls off and he ran home crying with his balls hanging on the flagpole. Everyone ***swore*** their mate had been there and saw it happen.

During the school holidays this one kid and his friends were playing on the hay bales in that field round by the back of his house and they climbed up but this one hay bale wobbled and fell off and landed on him and crushed his ribs and he nearly died but his friends ran to get his parents and they called an ambulance and then went to the field and lifted the hay bale off him and he died for like half an hour but the ambulance people brought him back to life and let him go home. He didn't have to go to hospital but he had to stay in bed all through the holidays until his ribs were better. He was ok by the time school started again. Sounds like bullshit but folk ***swore*** they were there and saw it all.

The teachers all had massive sex orgies in the staff room, that's why kids weren't allowed in. Folk ***swore*** they'd snuck in and watched without being seen. It's true! Honest!

Nicky and Kelly were dykes! While everyone else was outside at playtime they were caught in the library corner kissing and sticking pencils up each others twats! This one lad ***swore*** he'd seen them but they sucked his dick in exchange for his silence, so don't tell anyone he told you, ok?
Yup, junior school, ages... what, 6 to 10? Yup. Teachers shut that shit down hard when they found out.  
Turns out as the years rolled by he was right about Kelly.

There was a pervy tramp who lived in the old cellars under the school. He somehow had a key to get in that padlocked cellar door down the outside steps. He'd sneak into the school kitchens on an evening and weekends and get food and stuff, nick books from the library so he had stuff to read, and hide out all day so no one saw, and he used to smoke pot and spy into the girls toilets and he wore this big long dirty overcoat and had this long beard and looked like Catweazle. The teachers didn't know he was there but some kids ***swore*** they'd seen him around through the windows when they were playing football on the school playground on an evening.

Mark actually got hit by a train when he was playing chicken on the tracks because he didn't move cos he's not a chicken so it drove into him but it knocked him into the pond so he was ok. His mates ***swore*** they'd seen it happen.

Lee drank a full 2 liter bottle of cider that he nicked from the shop in one go and nearly died. He and his friends were hanging out under the railway bridge at the time and they dared him to do it but he passed out and they had to carry him back home, carrying one limb each and basically dragging him back. His dad called an ambulance just in time and they got his stomach pumped and he stayed in hospital for a while before he could come home. Folk ***swore*** they were there, and all their stories matched.  
This one's more or less true. I wasn't there for the drinking or passing out but I saw them dragging him back home pre-ambulance call. I didn't want to get involved so I just left them to it. They weren't my friends. Kid was a bit of a wanker and a bully so it didn't bother me if he'd died.  
A version of this has Lee's dad beating him black and blue as punishment once he got better, so bad that he ended up in hospital again. Sadly, this one's probably true too. I lived near some fine, upstanding folk back then. 

Infant school, early-to-mid-80s...

A big robot iron man thing lived in the trees on the railway embankment and would only come out on a night and that's what made all the weird marks and cuts and scrapes on the trees in the school grounds. Folk ***swore*** they'd seen it - it was made of metal and had big yellow lamps for eyes. Obvious silly kids's stuff, but we never did find out what damaged those trees, so maybe... 

Don't ever go in those smelly public toilets near the bus stop on the other side of the cricket field on the main road. That's where all the gays go to do drugs and wee and poo on each other. They'll get you and wee and poo on you too and make you do drugs. Folk ***swore*** they'd seen guys in there covered in poo but ran away before they were caught.  
Ahhhh, the 80s, such a simpler time... :/"
"Yes! Age discrimination is common: Elderly people are given free stuff or heavy discounts on many things such as utility bills, bus travel, and much more."
"If it was very recently his wife passed you could drop by with a sympathy card and introduce yourself.

Offer to get some stuff from the shops for him, basics like bread, milk, newspaper etc. If you drive and he doesn't maybe offer to take him one day if he wants to get more things. Or just go along with him if you both walk. 

Not sure on your bin situation but if bins go in the front garden maybe just wheel his back to his spot after collection day

If it gets and bit colder and it gets icy or snows, offer to clear his path or salt it to make it easier for him to go out.

If you happen to pass each other on the way in or out try and have a small chat, does he have any other family, kids, grandkids. Ask him about them. Also see if you can find something he's interested in. Does he support the local football team? If you do too, great. If not maybe just take an interest in the recent score and mention it in passing ""Good win for X on Saturday.""

Finally just generally just keep an eye out. If you spot him struggling with shopping come out and offer to help get him inside and put things away. Or just notice random things you could assist with. "

"try a bunch of stuff to find something you *enjoy*~ and which engages your brain!

 be open minded- sometimes stuff which you think will be incredibly dull or cringey can be masses of fun.
i was exactly like you- i loathed sports at school; it was traumatically bad. 

thankfully, as an adult ive found tons of stuff i love doing, and have gone through phases of being incredibly fit (sadly not now due to illness).

i went for a combo of stuff which engaged my brain~ (eg, i tried martial arts, then got into fencing), and stuff which just felt good for my body- swimming, and yoga.

you sound like you might enjoy the former, too.

the most obvious one to try is fencing, or broad sword fighting.
gives you a whole new insight into GOT/ assasin's creed/ star wars etc, and is fucking all round incredible.
its a huge subculture, too- lots of sports are like this. people can get VERY into it, so tend to be very welcoming to new comers. great social (*cough, pub) life, too. unusually, it gender equal, so guys dont have a weight or height advantage, and men and women fight each other in clubs (tho not at international level). i have shit hand eye co-ordination, and wasnt a great fencer, but its one of the best things ive ever, ever done.
its known as 3d chess, cos youre constantly trying to predict your opponent's next move, while simultaneously trying to kill them. unbeatable fun.

walking- can either be just walking- either together or with a group, or for a reason; geocaching, letter boxing, or visiting sites of interest to you- holy wells, stone circles, ruined castles, roman things- whatever. the countryside is littered with history. see some! traditionally, you end the walk at a nice pub.
bonus suggestion- get a dog to give your walks even more reason.

my parents used to drag me- horrible, moody, evil, resentful teenager- on healthy walks to nice places, and i loathed it all. 
now i do it voluntarily- cos they may- possibly- have been right about it. try it. lots of walk route blogs- have a google.

you could also try climbing- a little like fencing, there is a fair degree of brain activity involved, which i really like- trying to spot the best route to take, the best foot and hand holds etc. you can learn indoors in the winter, then head out doors once its warmer. there are loads of clubs, so it can be very social too, tho it doesnt have to be. also tends to end up with a pub visit. yay!
its one of those innate, primitive things which makes you inexplicably chuffed- just from climbing to the top of a big rock. then you can abseil back down!

personally, i found getting into sports/activities i *enjoyed* made me get fitter so i could progress with them- so i went to the gym, and swam to be a better fencer etc.

have a look on meetup, and gumtree groups to see what's on in your area- there are a lot of cool things to try.

final suggestion- volunteer to do a bit of conservation work- hacking down bushes and undergrowth, or meding dry stone walls etc. 
lots of opportunities- for the national trust or RSPB downwards. 
if you don't want to be massively social, say so when you email or call, and most places should try to accomodate you. Getting filthy is actually quite good fun, and you get huge accomplishment from seeing your work at the end of the day. 
Tbh, even litter picking can be good- where ever you are, you're within 100 miles of the sea. Take a carrier bag and fill it with all the plastic flotsham and jetson along the highwater line. A walk plus lots of bending and stretching, as well as helping marine life :)

There are also charity schemes which pair gardening volunteers with old or disabled people with gardens, if you've not got your own. Lovely thing to do, and can be very active- https://www.snvb.org.uk/projects-and-services/garden-buddies/ (there are similar schemes elsewhere)."

"My first thought would be for your safety. I don’t mean any malice towards you or the homeless woman. But you know next to nothing about this lady and what her circumstances are. Maybe she’s a nice person. Maybe not.

If I were in your shoes, I’d offer her food and some blankets and make sure she knows about the local shelters, etc where you live, during daylight hours, preferably accompanied with someone else.

 I wouldn’t invite her into my home, even though I sympathise with her plight. You can only do so much. "
No. Don't care about her opinions. Don't think she has much in common with most Brits.

"You should start talking to your doctor's quite frequently as the issue seems to be important to you. I'm not sure if the GP will want to provide any letter of proof as you haven't been talking to them about this, you just need to try and seem genuine.  Also try and get an appointment that is not so close to exams.  Do this shit asap."
"Some things to understand and be aware of - 

* People spend more time at work than they do at home and therefore communities form, any time there is a change to that community, it takes time for everyone to figure out who everyone else is and what the changes to the existing dynamics are, accounting for new personalities etc.

* You're new and people are judging you about all kinds of things; primarily your work ethic, but also how well you make the effort with them and how much you show you are willing to integrate into that work community

* People talk about each other all the time, in every aspect of life; when balanced, [gossip is a social skill, not a flaw](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-the-ooze/201601/gossip-is-social-skill-not-character-flaw) - it's how people bond, especially in work. It can get very bad and some people are bad for it, so avoid gossip where possible - the point is more that it is going to happen and it's not always a bad thing. 

* I have been involved in business decisions to *not* sack somebody who was bad (ish) at their job because they were good, friendly people; not nepotism or favouritism, but people who help create a positive atmosphere that takes the edge off being in work (where nobody wants to be) - sacking somebody who just happens to a ""solo player"" is a 50x easier decision to make and 50x easier to do.

* You don't need to become a social butterfly, but you do need to look for conversations you can attach to and have some input on; even if it's not directly related to what they're talking about and even if it's just like ""I've never seen that TV show, but I did see [this other one], are they similar?"" or whatever. 

* You can talk to people one on one, it doesn't need to be a group setting - and make people brews, people love it when people make brews for them. It takes 5 minutes and gets you massive brownie points. When one person is making a brew, offer to do a round and go make conversation with the other brew-bitch (though careful not to over-do this one, it can be creepy if you keep stalking the same person). 

* Read [How To Make Friends and Influence People](https://www.yourcoach.be/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Dale-Carnegie-How-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.pdf) (PDF warning) - it sounds cliche and it is, but sometimes we just need to see social rules and etiquette written down 

* If you're particularly awkward, find a copy of [Watching The English](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Watching-English-International-Bestseller-Revised/dp/1444785206/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) which goes into even more detail about the dos and don'ts of British social culture, what is appropriate, what isn't, etc. It's a proper 10/10 book.

* It's okay to be quiet and introverted, but make the effort to get to know people - ask some light questions about themselves; perfect opportunity is in your own post where you say a lot of people are from different backgrounds, talk to them about it, ask where you could go for a trip in their home country, etc. etc. 

* Put your phone the fuck down. I know, they're hypocrits but this is the #1 thing that pisses existing staff off about new people - you might only send 5 texts a day in work, but sure as fuck somebody is going to notice each one of those times and build the impression all you do is sit and do nothing, so instead of texting when you have nothing to do, do something to make you better at your job - read some policies, do some google-fu about the industry, ask people if they need any help, ask them questions about their job to show interest, whatever. 

I think there's finite window before people make up their minds and that becomes the general consensus that eventually works it back up to management, but there's still always opportunity to improve and not only do better at your job, but make being in work less awful for you as well."
If I had to guess it could be because English is more likely to be known by them than French or Italian.
"Talk to your extenuating circumstances office. Explain that you've been suffering from depression, undiagnosed, as a result of medical issues. It's a personal topic so they probably won't ask for more detail on what these issues are. Ask them what you would need to prove this and qualify for extenuating circumstances. In my experience, admin staff usually want to do their best to help, so if you explain your situation they'll let you know what the best thing to do is. If they ask for evidence from a doctor, book an appointment with a gp and talk about it to them, get a doctors note "

"Not myself but I worked in homelessness, outside of London.

£20 was a *very* good day. Passive begging got them about £8 a day on average. Aggressive begging got them about £10 and several move ons from the police. Add a guitar and a sad sign and you'll make about £15.

You can't go out and beg 7 days a week though as people get bored of giving, they recognise you, they don't want to give to the same person, etc. So you might make £10 in a day but you can only manage it 2-3 times a week, and as time goes on you'll get less and less. 

People got more from their JSA or ESA. Begging just topped it up. "
"Maybe not all for you, but as you get older: Winter fuel allowance, senior railcard, free TV licences, prescription charges, free passport, warm home discount scheme... Is that all propaganda?!

A lot of companies have discounts and tariffs based on age too."

"This is how I see it (and I think I saw some of this on a doco once).

Charles was born to be King. That's a curse and blessing. He had a privileged life while at the same time not being allowed all the freedoms and opportunities of a young man who could have gone on to do something he wanted.

As he grew he was the young popular royal that everyone wanted to shake hands with and meet on royal visits. His public persona was carefully managed by a respectful press (a la JFK and Monroe).

He fulfilled his role as future guardian of the monarchy by not getting involved too much in politics and but rather getting on with the things he could be passionate about - the people. However he had to be be careful and not say anything too controversial. He comes across as someone who cares a lot about the people but is prevented from saying too much to protect the constitutional position of the monarchy. He expressed  environmental concerns when those were  offbeat and considered crazy unlike today when they are well established. He got ridiculed for that ""you don't know what you are talking about Charlie - stick to shacking hands you big eared xxxxx"". 

He also didn't get married early, but he needed as part of this curse/blessing to have a heir (though by now no one cared if it was a son or daughter) so he needed to get married. However the woman he loved was now married to another. There is heavy speculation that they continued their relationship in secret after her marriage. But he couldn't marry a divorcee 'the powers that be' decided that would be as scandal as much as the Queen's uncle (edward the 8th) and the subsequent abdication crisis. So he was found a beautiful young 'virgin' to marry - Diana Spencer. Perhaps she had been groomed to be be a future consort - who knows?

Anyway the British public LOVED her. She was seen as a breath of fresh air blowing in the stuffy old royal family and was eventually taken by us (I was a kid when this happened) into British hearts as 'Princess Diana'. 

The nation loved her and the palace (the powers that be) could see that the her popularity could be used to boost the public opinion of the whole Royal family - sort of bringing it up to date like other European royals who were much closer to the public and well loved.

The media were allowed in much closer, getting more interviews and photos. Charles and Diana's popularity soared. People went wild to see them on royal visits.  However there was a dark side. Up to this point Charles had been the one with the celebrity but now Diana completely eclipsed him. He was slowly getting more and more fed up with this. There is comment someone one once made when he as on one side of the road and she the other and someone one said 'Oh it's you? We wanted to see Diana!"".

Anyway this resentment continued and that the the tabloid media 
 built this into a 'Lovely Diana Horrible Charles' soap opera. The royals were reduced to caricature soap opera figures.

Eventually this grew and grew. It became public that he never wanted her and really wanted to marry Bowles. This made the public (thanks to the tabloids) dislike him even more.  Diana was really loved he wasn't.

Then they split and she eventually dies in a suspicious car accident.  The grief felt felt by the public was not reflected by the royals how put on a show of classic stoicism. This was not what the public had now grown to expect from the 'new open' royal family. I think the public wanted more wearing of hearts on sleeves. Anyway this did the royals and Charles esp. no end of damage to public credibility.

So now this guy is 70ish and still not King and his kids have kids. He's now likely never to be king (*edit: thought I could be wrong*). The public never really forgave him.

I think this is the reason he's unpopular. Poor man trapped into a blessing/curse at the juxtaposition of the old world royals and the new. 

Edit: My own opinion of this is that of sadness. He never had an ordinary life, and when he wanted to, he wasn't allowed. It took many decades for him to finally marry the woman he loved. It's a shame that as a child and young he had so much yet so few options.  Princess Diana did the right thing and tried to give their boys that common touch. It shows and now Harry is a loved by so many. At least Charles can look at his boys and think - Britain will be safe with them."
"&gt;If you like spicy food, bring spices with you. Tabasco and Sriracha is available everywhere, but everything else is impossible to find.

This is news to me.  Maybe I've got a massive blind spot here, but most supermarkets carry a pretty decent basic range of spices, and Asian shops/markets tend to carry the rest.

What do you struggle to find?"
"Yep, needs to be - from an established hot take-away trade, and are selling the food as a part of that trade, advertise it as either hot take-away food or in any other way which indicates that it is meant to be eaten while still hot, sell it accompanied by napkins, forks, etc to enable it to be eaten before it cools."
"It’s one of the largest, most cosmopolitan cities in the world, you can find someone to do pretty much anything that you can think of.

"We like to juggle and mess with bank holidays and weekends to get as long off as we can.  For instance, this coming Easter

You won't return until Tuesday the 7th of May because of early Bank Holiday, meaning you'll have enjoyed 18 consecutive days off.  

I am only posting this as I have already secured these days off in my office.

"I was there the year it got banned... (In our school anyway) kid got smashed in a tackle and badly hurt his neck and had to be airlifted to hospital. It wasn't banned but teachers kept a eye whenever it was being played. About a year or so later, the same kid really hurt his back playing and had to get airlifted... Again. After that the game was banned.
