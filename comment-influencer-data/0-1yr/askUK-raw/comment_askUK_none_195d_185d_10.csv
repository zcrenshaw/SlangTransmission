Edinburgh. 
Transformers regular voltage but not input-frequency I believe.
"With regards to commission, every recruitment job I've seen advertised uncapped commission, does what you say still apply? 

How does your company find candidates? Are there special tools? What special tools? Is it a case of LinkedIn?

I see a lot about commission but no advertised commission rates. "
Well if it's windy outside already we don't need them going making it even worse!
How? do you train police dogs? work in the vets?
"I can tell you with almost absolute certainty that the fancy roof will cost far more than you’ll ever save on energy. If your reasons are aesthetic, that’s for you to decide. But for energy savings reasons: nah.  

Think of the box analogy again, the space really isn’t designed to keep heat in efficiently. Single pain glass/poly is fine trapping winter heat. That’s why you don’t get double glazed greenhouses. :)
"
"I go in. If you're in a certain kind of environment then I can understand why you wouldn't, for fear of passing things on to vulnerable people or just grossing people out if you have to be in close contact with them as part of your job, but for people with regular office/warehouse/manual labour/trade jobs then I think a cold is a pretty crap reason to be off."
Cheers Jim of Wales energy efficiency guru. 
That’s one I’m highly considering at the moment.
"&gt;that it is an offence to be drunk and in charge of cattle in England and Wales

This one isn't really that weird when you think about it to be fair, I'd the say the consequences for drink driving cattle could be worse than drink driving a car. Sure you might crash into a chippy or something but an entire herd of cattle could make the place look like Vikings were about.

Did make me think of that one that allows citizens of the City of London to move sheep across the Thames or something though."
It's illegal to borrow a library book if you've got food poisoning.
"Yes! Thank you! Hahahaha...we’re definitely starting to come to the same realization. I think the plan now is to do Manchester/Liverpool, probably rent a car, drive up to Edinburgh, then on to possibly Inverness, then drive back down through Glasgow, back to Liverpool/Manc. As much as we’d love to see everything possible, I think this style of trip of taking our time and sticking to a smaller region will make it much for fulfilling. Thanks for the great advice. The drive your suggesting from Liverpool to Edinburgh sounds divine."
"people have already covered the allies having air and sea superiority, one thing that is kind of mind blowing is the allies had over 5,000 ships involved in D day between warships, troop and supplie transports, and landing craft."
Danish Dollars of course
"&gt;Does this seem like too much?

Yes. Pick two, maybe three places at most for 12 days. Any more any you will be spending time traveling. 

&gt;Is London a must see?

Yes. I would put the order of things to see to be London -&gt; Manchester -&gt; Edinburgh -&gt; Ireland -&gt; Bristol. Pick two or three places at most.

&gt;Best ways to travel?

Train if you can afford it. Driving in the UK is not like driving in the US. Don't attempt to drive in London unless you want to be very frustrated."
Damn. I kinda wish they were super common haha
I went to Essex and the mandatory modules didn’t have complex maths that I remember. Just don’t do graphics related stuff like 3D objects or computer vision. God the trigonometry. Also avoid game theory and probably anything robotics based. 
"iPlayer would have been sufficient as an all-encompassing term for web/Internet based content. 
'Sounds' gives me the impression of some dowdy 50-something desperately trying to make online radio more appealing to a younger audience by calling it something totally wizard. "
"BBC Sounds isn’t just a rebrand as work for work’s sake. As Radio is a dying platform, they’ve launched the BBC Sounds app, which provides a medium between actual radio and streaming services like Spotify, as well as being a central place to access all BBC Radio content - podcasts, live lounge etc"
Again it depends on your company's payroll. Just ask
"That's a pretty bad plan, you'll be spending more time seeing motorways than enjoying cities. 

Cut down, and consider just getting the train. "
"Or twerk in public, flash people and say cunt"
"Old bugger here.

I could be sitting at home and suddenly realise I'm hungry; I'd say to my friends (at least one of whom would be black), ""Fancy a chinky?""

Am I racist? Is my black friend?

One time a black friend was feeling sick from drinking too much and another friend said ""Look at him! He's gone sheet brown!""

The black mate puked from laughing so much.

I think it's all about how offended you *want* to be these days"
"Racists don't like being called racist. So just simply say something like ""that's a bit racist, isn't it"" and they'll usually shut up. "

"There's the obviously reason that recently there's a significant amount of racism against Pakistanis, and that word is often used as a slur. The other reason is Indians hate being called Pakistanis. It's like calling Scottish people English or Portuguese Spanish. "
Also were you thinking of [this link](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-uk) when you mentioned the Times has a good university guide?

"It depends. when I was in Cuba I had a taxi driver who wouldn't stop talking about Cuba and his favourite places etc. it was really good information and I was enjoying his talks but then he starts saying that black people in Cuba (which there are a sizable population of) are lazy, and lie around all day doing nothing. he went on for like 20 minutes saying they're stupid, don't work, and are just a drain on Cuba. 

I didn't really know the situation so I didn't say anything just nodded along. idk if he's right or wrong."
"Racism is part of The Knowledge, no?"
Radio is not a dying platform its actually a surprisingly stable one. 
I think you need to see a therapist. 
You need to do some research... 
"So because I want to fight of germs there's something wrong with me?

"Yes. Always call it out (unless doing so puts you in danger). Because these people often aren't challenged, they think the world agrees with them."

It's important to find out how well they're considered for your specific course. The overall ranking shouldn't inform your decision too much.
"It's her army, she's commander-in-chief, all officers hold her commission, all soldiers swear to obey her. So yeah, she could go in."
Scotland's fantastic. I went to Scotland for the first ever time when I started university up there. Best decision I ever made. I wish deeply I could go back
"Come to Kent, it’s near London. Also we have lions!"
"If your TV supports Dolby Vision or HDR then Star Trek: Discovery meets the colourful part, even if it isn't in 4K. "
"How important is Liverpool to you? Because this is a lot of time spent traveling for such a short trip. A flight from London to Dublin is like an hour and usually pretty cheap - driving 5 hours up the motorway to get to Liverpool really isn't going to enhance your trip in any way, and then you've got to wait around for the ferry and do the cross. It's very inefficient unless Liverpool is a pivotal point for some reason. Then you're going from Liverpool to Dundee which is another 6 hour drive... why not fly from Dublin to Edinburgh, hire a car in Edinburgh to go back and forth to Dundee if you want, then fly from Edinburgh back to London.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you hit traffic you can potentially add several hours, add more time for basic service stops, eating lunch etc.... 

&amp;#x200B;

I suspect you might be overestimating what there is to see on these drives and ""stopping and messing around in the countryside"" is not as simple as you might think when the majority of journey is on a 70mph motorway. If it was me I would ditch the driving, fly, have a couple of extra days essentially to explore the surroundings of the cities you make your base in (Edinburgh, Dublin perhaps)."
The people who complained about *the words* Amber Rudd used in that instance - as opposed to *the content* of her words - are fucking idiots.
Old Rosie is dangerously tasty and packs a mean punch.
"Coming from the East-End, I used to hear 'Chinky' used in a neutral tone to refer to a Chinese Takeaway."

"“Thanks for not using a fucking Uber anyway.Those Uber drivers literally ripped the pot noddles from my baby’s mouth.”

What compels these taxi drivers to buy the daily mail is it, a fatal flaw with black cabs pumping fumes through the radio or some shit."

"The last part really asks the question around banter though. Me and my mates take the piss out of eachother, whether its about something we can control (shit haircut) or cant (going bald), its all good natured though. 

If you act differently towards a woman because shes a woman and give her different treatment, is that not as bad?"
Some times pointing without can be super awkward and create tense situations. I tend to only call it out if it's directed at an individual. If they are spouting bullshit I'll just ignore and make it clear I don't approve.
Ooo arr
I try to but you've got to pick your battles sometimes.
"&gt; Wont driving north through England to Liverpool be pretty?

I'll echo others and say - no, absolutely not.

Motorways in the UK are not big roads that cut through scenic country views. 

All you will see is crap industrial areas and empty fields or trees intended to separate people's homes from the nasty motorway. 

"
"Absolutely.

Within my family I do. And regularly get told to ""stop bringing up politics"" because I call my family out on it.


Even in pubs I give out to randomer who say racist shit.


I'm lucky though. I'm a huge built guy so they take one look and decide to not start on me.

"Dubrovnik is wonderful. Docletian's palace and vestibule was a personal favourite, but the whole city's wonderful."
What’s the point if you don’t?
Turkish Massage... If you get offered this and they say it'll extend the life of your carpet don't fall for it.. It's bullshit and won't extend the life of your carpet one bit!
"Not really. Most of the time, the people saying those things were massive dickheads, and I had no interest in speaking to them. Either because I was a bit scared of them or because they were clearly aware they were being racist i.e. they would have been thrilled if someone gave them attention and allowed them to go on a racist rant. 

With more subtle racism, I;d kinda feel like I'd be a hypocrite for calling them out. I don't call other people out for their idiotic views on gender, science, ethical issues etc. Who am I to decide that not liking immigrants isn't a valid viewpoint, but some of the crap I've heard religious zealots say is okay? 

When someone says something deeply unpleasant, my inclination is to get as far away from them as possible. "
"If you're flying over England, you can always see signs of humans, even if it's just a road and couple of farmhouses. The couple of time I've flown down the south coast of Canada/USA I was amazed that we went for several minutes of just being able to see wilderness, no sign of humans at all, not even a road."
"That's a hit to the ego as someone who went to uni in York and loved it haha. But I would bear in mind Canterbury is very similar to York, maybe smaller. Newcastle is by far the largest and most diverse city of the three you listed. "
"Me, Mr W and our dog Frank in a tiny cottage somewhere on the coast. Long walks every day with picnics on tops of hills, and cooling our sore paws in the surf afterwards. Lazy evenings in the garden if it’s warm enough, or in front of the TV if not, with the maps out, planning the next day’s adventure.

Our next one is booked for the end of April. Unfortunately, Frank has an aggressive tumour and the vet doesn’t think she has more than a few weeks left. We’ve got everything crossed that we get to take her on one last family holiday. xx

Agreed. Don’t spend time with that person anymore OP. You can’t associate with monsters like that. 
"It can depend on how close you are to Manchester really. A lot of the town's on the edges can be very white or very South Asian, without a great deal of mixing. You won't find much progressive thinking there. Head into the middle of Manchester and you'll find things to be a lot more metropolitan and diverse.

So, what town? As a general theme, the UK is less religious than the USA. We are far more secular. Abortion and hub control aren't political issues. There is less forced nationalism (flags, pledges of allegiance).

You will still find racism and homophobia, but it will be different. Brexit has brought up a lot of anti-European sentiment."
You really have an attitude problem.  If this is how you respond to people who give you helpful answers no wonder you're getting nothing off the forums. I see you've been deleted here too.  Good luck writing that essay!

"Because people like to signal their virtue by disagreeing with ANY law breaking, to show how law abiding they are.

Fact is, there is no more danger driving at 110mph than 70. It's HOW you do it that's the issue. And in this case, he's doing it badly. In a Skoda."

"Friend of mine died 2 years ago at 26. I always think of the cruel reality that I get to grow old and she will forever be in her 20s. She will never get to get married, travel, have a family, enjoy meals out in nice places. All those things. Every day I do little things for her because she no longer can. Sorry for your loss. "
"I'm a couple of years behind you but I'm the same. I'm 29 and thinking back to age 19 or even my early 20s doesn't feel very long ago but the gap between age 9 and 19 felt so much longer.

Hell, literally today I'm celebrating being employed in the same workplace for 5 years. Officially longer than I spent in secondary school. At the time that felt like forever."
The number of people? You know London isn't the entirety of the south don't you? 
"Your assessment is about right. r/uk is an echo chamber and baduk does a good job of pointing out some of the craziest shit on there, but as you say it's a shithole in its own way. It's fascinating how often something is deemed 'not baduk' when it's a right-winger doing it..."
