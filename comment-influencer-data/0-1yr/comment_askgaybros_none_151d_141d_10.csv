"He‚Äôs just mad lonely I think, being young and gay like that can be really hard because there‚Äôs literally no outlet for someone‚Äôs sexual frustration. 

Don‚Äôt tell your parents it‚Äôll prob just traumatize him but just try and make him aware of how hurt he could get on there, physically and emotionally. Just make sure he knows he can talk to you about anything and he should be good. 

Tbh get him on Reddit if he isn‚Äôt already. The gay oriented sub Reddit‚Äôs are so helpful in coping with anything and it might give him a sense of community or belonging.

Thanks for being such a cool brother tho that‚Äôll def help him the most."
"Aw. Suggestion, ask to buy him a thank you drink. Chance to talk a bit more and figure out if he's gay/straight."
"&gt;I (24M) am a gay guy of fairly loose morals.

Soulmate? Is that you?"
"Wow, porn with decent plottwist"
I find it far less awkward to sit at the bar / counter when I‚Äôm alone than in a booth
Now that is adorable!
... maybe try an app more centred around dating than casual sex?
"&gt;Tbh get him on Reddit if he isn‚Äôt already. 

Actually very good advice, subs like this one helped me a lot when I was still closeted."
But did joe turn up?
Why am I crying rn fuck I've been alone for too long
"As a fat guy I am in one of the groups most hated in the gay community.

I don't mind it in personal ads. Really. It says ""Don't waste your time on this one, he's not interested and he's not worth it anyway."" I'd rather he say it outright than waste my time writing a reply to him (and worse, sometimes a guy actually is nasty enough to write back to say, more or less, ""how *dare* an ugly guy like you write to me""), and he'll never look at it anyway because I'm not thin enough for him. Really, I just want personal ad systems that will let me filter out ads for guys that aren't attracted to me anyway. Some will let me do that. I find I drift away from the others. Yeah, there are nicer ways to put it than ""no fats"", I don't like being reduced to being seen as ""a fat"", I'm always tempted to ask him if vegetable oil is okay, but it's better than having to put up with him bitching at me later.

I mind it a lot in bars and clubs. Not that guys aren't attracted to me because I'm fat - really, *I'm* not attracted to me, so why should any random guy be? But that they have to be *rude* about it. If I try to hit on you, you could make polite small talk, or you could politely dissuade me from talking to you by just giving a non-answer to everything I might say (terse responses like ""yes"" and ""no"" tend to give the hint), or at worst you could smile at me and say ""thank you but I'm not interested."" But no, guys actually go out of their way to treat me like dirt, even when this comes at some personal effort to themself. It has reached the point that I won't go to a bar or club any more because I know I'll be mistreated, which I'm sure makes the haters happy but they'll stop being happy when all the gay bars and clubs close because nobody wants to be around them any more."
Incredibly sexy men are incredibly sexy.
"True. I was trying to be off my phone and ""live in the moment"", so I ended up just staring at the booth seat in front of me the entire time."
Joe came twice
Play hard to get and block him
I‚Äôve eaten at restaurants alone before. It really isn‚Äôt so bad if you bring a tablet or a book to read.
I hardly think 3 dates is slow.
Who cares?  This isn't even worth having an opinion on.  Sometimes people express themselves differently from how you express yourself.  It's a world with 7 billion people in it that are all pretty different.  Better to just get over it.
"Yes, I still have this naive mentality like ‚Äúone day I‚Äôll be hot and all the people that didn‚Äôt wanted me will contact me...‚Äù girl I need to get a damn grip lmao"
"My mom always told me ugly kids grow up to be handsome. I'm 31. I want my handsome now, thank you."
"I understand it is harder for some people but for me, it was no brainer. My bf asked me if he could top me, it was his first time and I just couldn't say no even if I gave up on bottoming because it never felt right."
"I am so sorry for your loss. I can hardly imagine the pain you're going through.

I know this is something many people have told you, but it's all I can offer, and I'm sure you know it's true: Your fiance wouldn't want you to suffer like this. He would want you to be happy, and live a full life, even if he couldn't be there with you.

I know you can't just choose to ""get better"", but at the same time, don't feel guilty for moving ahead with life, even with eventually finding another person to love. I'm sure your fiance would never have wanted to be a ball and chain dragging you down to darkness. He would want his memory to bring comfort to you while you continued with life."
I probably worded that weird. I‚ÄôM joe haha
"I'm fully prepared to hear he's straight (just preparing myself for that), and if he is, awesome, made a nice new friend and we can leave it at that!"
"UPDATE #1

Bros Bros Bros IT'S UPDATE TIME: 

 

After an entire day of classes, nervously pondering what will come of this.....

.....

&amp;#x200B;

HE ADDED ME ON SNAPCHAT!!! So...what do I do now &lt;o.o&gt;"
"Great point!

Plus if he's straight that's a good way to make a friend, it's just have a nice one-time chat :)"
"that‚Äôs probably why she gave you something free, because you looked sad and beat up just staring into the distance. If you were reading a book she prob wouldn‚Äôt have done that"
I think your landlord just saw a lost cute guy and shot his shot.
"24/7, mate, I'm like half present and half dreaming all the time"
r/LGBTeens is really good
there‚Äôs separate subreddit for this r/AITA
"I have a lot of straight friends I really clicked with and we'll be really fucken gay together, flirt, joke around, touch each other but at the end of the day, they're straight and not gay. 

Just enjoy it and don't fall in love, man. 

And if he is gay, fuck you, we're all jealous."
"Having a guy really take care of you can make their attractiveness shoot **way** up.  Not only is he cute, but he also helped get you calm and made you feel safe, and you both touched and he helped make you feel better.  Even though it's not a romantic or sexual thing, it's a very intimate experience to share with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

I can relate -- I was in a car accident in my 20s and had to be take to the hospital in an ambulance.  I was pretty afraid, but the EMT guy told me things would be okay and he held my hand for the 15 mile drive and I was totally crushing on him."
Just consider him a sweetheart and let it be.  Because if he really isn‚Äôt into you an advance gone wrong could lead to a harassment accusation or at minimum make working there unpleasant for you both.
"It‚Äôs a polished look, their ties point down to their dicks (and actually represent their dicks of you think about it). Daddy/sir vibe, fully clothed to add mystery/curiosity about what lies underneath. Power. Authority. Masculinity. Uniform fetish. Pick any two :-)"
I wish more guys were like that.  Seems like all guys think if I ask you for a coffee or dinner that means they're gonna get laid.
Slow for gay guys tbh
Waddup my name is Jared I‚Äôm 19 and I never learned how to fucking read
"I think the problem also comes from gay men only seeing each other as potential partners/competitors. If you only talk with the gay community on Grindr you do get really judged on your physical characteristics, while as in real life you might have a conversation with someone and get to know them based off of their personality."
I love your confidence! Keep us updated!
"He looked so cute in it too. He was also so willing to take it, haha. Most people would be like ""No it's okay, it's your hat, I will just wear it for a bit"" or something of that nature, but he accepted the offer without thinking twice."
/r/AITA in case OP didn't know
"OKCupid.  


Not even joking. It might come off as this kind of straight app, but there's definitely A LOT of gay people on there and it's a lot less intimidating than something like Tinder."
Almost nothing so petty is worth very much of your emotion.
I think it's the tight pants ü§™
some things I‚Äôll never experience as an ugly gay man
Yup. Bartenders at good places are friendly and happy to chat. I‚Äôve made some good bartending friends this way‚Äîespecially if you tip well and come back at regular times.
"Oh gosh. Get off Grindr if all you want is someone to hold your hand. If you want affection, casual sex will never be the place you find it."
"1. yes

2. yes.

3. you should ensure there isn't a bullet in the chamber, how one goes about doing that is up to them.

4. yes, especially these days when anecdotally it seems many in a certain age group are sticking rigidly to one role

5. in 20 years of sex, can count on one hand how many times there's been a mess. that said, it happens. it's a butt.

6. you generally can't."
"See I think that a guy's treasure trail is like a girl's boobs. Even when their owner isn't necessarily attractive, I'm compulsed to look."
"Ah, the old ‚Äòbuying friendship‚Äô method."
Make him delete the app and find a gay group for teens his own age ( depending on where you live ) for him to be a part of. Be a good big brother and talk to him about the dangers of meeting people offline. Talk about predators and always telling you if he's going to do it. ( not that he should be meeting people but kids are kids )
My type
"&gt;When you love the guy you do it

This. Compromise. Selflessness. Can be applied to so much in a relationship."
"Love it. ""Loose morals"" was my fav"
That does sound sweet. I remember one ask men post and it talked about how a lot of men are deprived of emotional reinforcement and compliments. Getting that little ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so cute‚Äù comment is probably the only time he will ever hear someone say something positive about his appearance.
"Sounded strange at first but understandable in the end. A bit extreme lesson I guess, but hey! I bet it felt good in more ways than one haah!!"
Awweee OP is a smol angery doggo borking at something pointless
Oh well where is the landlords hookup. And how didnt you notice your landlord on grindr.
Too early to tell probably. Keep getting to know him and see how it plays out!
"this didn't go the way I thought it would. 10/10, awesome post."
"Can I offer you some hugs and a little bit of love?

I am kind of fat (and Asian to boot) and used to get random insults on grindr (good thing I got rid of it, was too toxic). I never specifically hit someone on gay bars as I've only went to one for a meal and stuff but my two cents for you fam is something I noticed, bears look to be more approachable than muscle built lads (some of them are terrible people, imo).
Also love yourself more, you can't really say you're not attractive because someone might look at you and think you are!

(P.s. I'm terrible at this but I hope you get what I mean)"
"I've kind of been on the other end (without wanting to sound braggy, urgh).

The only time it ever causes problems is when the person who 'thinks they're unattractive' gets so caught up in that they cease to see their own worth. And I think that's where you are.

It really, really doesn't matter. They might hit on him but **he's with you**. They can want all they want but **you're** the one who gets to go home with him, share his life, suck his dick, let him suck yours. **You're** the one he holds when he's sad; calls when he needs to hear your voice; eyerolls at over a shared joke.

You will always come off second-best if you compare yourself to others -- even your own significant other -- because your brain will search and search and search for the differences, and then *pickpickpick* away when it finds them. Basing your self-esteem on looks is also a hiding to nothing. A lasting, solid sense of self-worth comes from who you are and what you do, not what you look like. If you get too caught up in not being hit on versus him being hit on a lot, you risk turning your focus inwards onto yourself. And that way narcissism lies.

You are you and he is him and that's the end of it. He's with you for numerous reasons, just like you are with him for numerous reasons. He finds you as attractive as you find him otherwise you wouldn't be together."
I can't love another man. I don't want to. I have found real love and experienced it first hand. And it was the most wonderful thing you can imagine. But it's over now. And it's a once in a lifetime thing.
"I‚Äôm not a parent and not giving parenting advice.  I just want to say that at your son‚Äôs age I found the same loophole in the rules and definitely took advantage. I‚Äôm very glad now that my parents who obviously figured it out didn‚Äôt enforce a rule for me. Being gay in high school was an incredibly rough experience, absolutely terrible and being able to have my boyfriend sleepover was one of the very few sources of happiness I had in that brutal world.  At least no one is getting pregnant or looking for dangerous places to have sex in."
This. She misjudged your body language and (tactlessly) tried to show compassion. She was trying to be nice and you got a free drink. I don‚Äôt see the problem.
because they give you sense of security and authority
"I think, and hope, your brother got the rude awakening he needed to not do this again. I'm just glad the guy wasn't older or a predator"
"I would point out to him that the reason the other guy was angry was probably because meeting up with underage boys you meet on a gay sex app is one way to quickly get branded a paedo.

Next step is to find him some local, age appropriate gay people to hang out with. He's not 'out' and I doubt he has many openly gay friends. This guy could literally be the first other gay person he's met.

I would look for local LGBT+ youth groups for him. He's probably lonely and confused and turning to the easiest way he can find to make contact with other people like him. Unfortunately it's also one of the worst ways to get introduced to the world of gay (tm)."
"If his landlord's hot, he wouldn't even be asking if he's Joe and continue the charade."
"He‚Äôs already decided whether he wants to go out with you or not.  And by adding you on Snapchat, he‚Äôs given every indication it‚Äôs a yes.  No need to convince him.  No need to explain more.  Just flatly ask him ‚ÄúHey!  Want to grab [coffee place name] with me during the day Saturday?‚Äù or whatever.  But including a time and/or location in a message that is as short as possible is, in my opinion, the best way to not mess it up."
No. He tried to get him to shoot *his* shot.
**socioeconomic status is my kink**
"It‚Äôs customary to block all your neighbors, so probably the landlord had blocked him from the second he saw him on there."
"I think its one of my favourite things about liking guys - that protective and caring nature they can sometimes exhibit, like in this instance"
Or Husbro... ü§Æ
"This. For my third date I spent the day with him at a theme park and we blacked out riding coasters. Then ended the night with a kiss. Nothing sexual, but very wholesome."
"Welcome to the gay community where being attractive, young, fit and stylish is primary. If you don't check all the boxes you're out."
"Is your landlord hot? That would be convenient if he is.

Funny story though!"
"I know people that form aneurysms when people say doggo or pupper but I‚Äôm someone that can‚Äôt stand when people, especially gay men refer to their husband/partner exclusively as ‚Äúhubby‚Äù lol."
It‚Äôs not even that good lol
"Gat men tend to enjoy every part of a hot guy.  His sweat, musk, feet, ass, etc.  Women are like hot for abs but everything else grosses them out."
He is stupid. Move on.
"Lol, customary.  In the land of gay, one does not ogle one‚Äôs neighbors ..."
Gays actually enjoy giving blowjobs
"Or some guys that think unless fireworks are exploding between you two, that there is no relationship."
"As a server, she‚Äôs missing quite a bit of tact... But I just sit at the bar if I‚Äôm going out by myself for a quick bite and a drink or two."
F for this man.
wow hes boring asf
"no it‚Äôs perfectly fine, as long as you‚Äôre not rude about it (which you weren‚Äôt) so it sounds like he just hasn‚Äôt learned to deal with rejection that well lmaoooo"
Yeah. All the time.
"Careful, they‚Äôre fragile"
"I mean, it does suck getting rejected. But on the other hand, no one is *entitled* to another's body. If they're not into you, they're not into you."
Time to shove a piece of wood up my ass and hope for the worst
"I was in a similar situation, i was once a top turned versatile and ended with a guy that was a top and it was my turn to turn him. But he was a hard nut to crack. He gave up eventually and trusted me that i would take care of him. I love that we can fuck each other brains whenever we want to."
"I agree that if you think you might really like the guy that taking it slow is wise.

I don't think ""banging on the third date"" is taking it slow."
Toned. maybe Boy Next Door.
Im in this post and I don't like it.
"What was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù was him asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù after you rejected him. Like, have some fucking self respect and move on."
"no no no, you want access to his stories so you just ignore every snap and leave him hanging."
Good read and nice story. Great for you dude!
"re question 6:
if he's effeminate and stereotypically gay, he's probably a bottom.
if he's a jock who goes out of his way to let you know how masc he is, he's also probably a bottom."
It‚Äôs like a cleavage flash for gay men
ü§£
"What if your landlord just thought ""sure why not?"" when Kyle asked him, ""Grindr?"""
"In universe, nothing extinguishes: he's with you, in your mind and heart and in a spiritual level. The bond you created with your fiance is eternal. He's part of you, more than anyone. I'm extemely moved by your depoiment. I just feel the need to add that every relationship is unique and, please, if life brings a special person to you, don't reject him because you think you'll be betraying the love of your life. Love comes differently and each one can be precious."
"Thanks for replying, I'll try looking into safer online or real life communities for young people and maybe bring it up with my brother. He never even told me that he's gay or bisexual, though when I think of it, I've had some suspicions. Our parents can have very extreme reactions, plus I know our dad isn't at all fond of gay people, and I think that's why he doesn't want them to know. I'm still not sure whether I should tell them something though, probably not that specifically that he was meeting up with a guy, but something more vague about online safety."
I mean I'm sure I appreciated them as an infant...
"Some people are born with good genes and are naturally good looking, however for the rest of us we need to work just a bit harder to be attractive. 

First, having a good body can sometimes mitigate a poorly shaped face and often times, being healthy in general will improve your facial structure overall making you look less ugly than when you were an unfit slob. 

Secondly, growing a beard can mask a bad jaw line and make you appear more masculine. Beards are insanely good tool, so if you can grow one definitely do it. 

Thirdly, personality is extremely vital if you have an unfortunate looking face. If you can attract people with your intelligence or witty sense of humour, then you won't be too far behind. This is why you shouldn't be a shithead in general. 

If you can do all three and still can't find a partner then you're definitely doing something wrong."
"""I'm gonna need a rent discount, for stealing my dick appointment."""
"If the first three mutual friends are gay, you know what‚Äôs up"
The other day this cute guy on the CTA fucked me with his eyes for like five minutes.  I was so flattered. I hadn‚Äôt been eyefucked like that on public transportation in years. Made my day
True a hot guy will look hotter with a suit on and a average unhealthy man will just look like an average unhealthy man but in a suit
Awwwweee what a Smol Doggo
Holemates*
"Question! Why are doggo and smoke bad yet you can use, [AND I QUOTE FROM THIS POST YOU MADE 3 DAYS AGO,](https://www.reddit.com/r/forearmporn/comments/bbcvd7/gay_chubbo_forearm/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) ""chubbo""? Seems mildly hypocritical..."
Yes. Would be safer than being with a guy who doesn't know his status. And you should be wearing condons all the time anyway because people lie. But we need to be more educated on hiv and safe sex and stop ignorantly stigmatizing positive people.
"I have found that most women... Don't like penises. They just find men attractive. Whereas, a lot of gay guys genuinely find the penises attached to the men they're attracted too, also attractive. I genuinely enjoy dick. It looks neat, it feels neat, and tastes neat, etc. My female friends all seem to agree penises are just weird and... There."
Handsome is sold separately.
"can we start calling cute guys in wheelchairs ""meals on wheels""? okay bye."
"I'm kinda drunk rn and my longest relationship was 6 months long but it was incredibly meaningful to me. Anyway, i was a college sophomore attending a different school and one night -- one of the first into it -- i slept over. I didn't want to impose that morning and knew what time i could catch the early train back to the city. but when i woke up and started crawling out of bed he asked me where i was going. 

I explained that i figured he'd want me out of his dorm so it was probably time for me to go. he kind of pulled me in and held me really tight and said ""it's not time yet."" then he fell back asleep with me in his arms."
"Not having to pretend to be 18 to participate in discussions and having a variety of subs makes Reddit ideal. It eliminates the need to lie at all (which he might think is his only option to interact with people like himself), and it lets him find other subs he likes too rather than being limited to the LGBT+ subs. 

When I was his age, I joined a few LGBT+ friendly forums that had a blanket 18+ rule to keep the webmaster safe. I just wanted to talk about my hobbies and my identity without being treated like a child. But naturally, the lie that I was several years older snowballed into other lies over time to support it and to keep the other lies consistent, until I was actually close to 18 and a big chunk of my friends/support network thought I was a different, older person. I had to ghost that part of my life and start my entire internet presence freshly, and I regret not just being honest from the start. I'm probably just projecting, but I can see a little of that willingness to lie just to be accepted in his actions."
"It‚Äôs your money and you can spend it on whatever you want, you‚Äôve bought an XBOX not kilo of cocaine. 

Plus it sounds like he‚Äôs doing sex videos on XTUBE for money. 

I can‚Äôt tell you what to do but if it was me he‚Äôd be cancelled."
‚ÄúOh no I can‚Äôt believe we both got stood up for our double date.  Now if you‚Äôll just bring us our free crab cakes we‚Äôll be on our way.‚Äù

"Dont you dare be ashamed of your accent! Every single person on the earth that is alive has an ""accent"". And trust me, as an American, we LOVE accents! Instant turn ON!"
I'm my favorite gay joke
The post is tagged ‚Äúshitpost‚Äù. I really hope that‚Äôs not literal
i feel like it might be because often homophobic people judge us and our whole personality just because we are gay so in a fucked up way we‚Äôve kinda adopted that attitude too maybe
Valid opinion. Just don't shun yourself from other people.
...But with implied socioeconomic status.
"I‚Äôm a top in a relationship with another top. 

It was definitely pretty painful and awkward at first but trusting one another is what helped us push through. 

He‚Äôs taken more of a verse bottom role while I mainly top because I still don‚Äôt enjoy bottoming but I‚Äôll do it when he asks cause I love the dude, I love his dirty talk, grunts and moans and that makes it worth it to me."
"Aren't those things typically only posted on hookup apps? Not being attracted to a specific type doesn't mean you don't recongize them as part of you ""group"". Like just because I don't want to have sex with an overweight gay doesn't mean I don't see them as gay."
"When I have to wear a suit for work, I always make sure to wear a jockstrap under it."
"One night stands are just another kind of alone, buddy. Possibly the most toxic one."
Any suggestions?
I‚Äôll take all of those.
"no, because you don't even have to be a hot sexy slut to achieve that."
"Confront him and explain sex should be a two way street. You shouldn't be the only one giving all the time. I get it he's not super into it, but he should be willing to help you out. I'm not a huge fan of bottoming but I do it from time to time for my bf."
You can never be ugly to gay people ever unless you're downright disgusting (personality and hygiene wise). I have never seen myself thinking negative about a person unless they looked like they crawled out of the sewer or have an attitude which is unlikable.
Great. Now every time I see a sexy guy in a suit I‚Äôll be thinking of him in a jockstrap under it.
Really? Even then I thought they sucked
Yes and when I imagine that cute cuddly guy that I'm kissing I feel all peaceful and it helps me fall asleep üò™üò≠

Check out his facebook? Usually a pretty easy way to tell. Even just by mutual friends.
"My department has a decades-long tradition of going out to breakfast at Cracker Barrel on people's last day. After eight years here, I'm leaving next month - and I am *not* looking forward to telling my boss I'd rather go somewhere that has a better track record with the gays."
"I think based on your post you seem like a really compassionate and caring father, and if you do confront him and explain it how you did here he‚Äôll understand, that being said the conversation might be kinda awkward."
"Look, I'm gonna be blunt, because I think you need to hear a more realistic perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

You made this post and have this outlook because it's the easy thing to do. You get to pat yourself on the back for being too intellectual and use that as an excuse to not do the things you want to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't take the easy way out. Because at the end of the day, it's actually not easier. You tell yourself it's better to endure feeling isolated and depressed than it is to take a risk and face rejection or failure, believe me, I've been there \*So\*. Fucking. Often. 

&amp;#x200B;

But you're lying to yourself. Don't sit here wasting your life wallowing in misery and patting yourself on the back for being ""too smart"" or ""too much of a thinker"" to enjoy the reality that you want to create.

 

You \*are\* smart. You \*are\* intelligent. So use that intelligence, take a look at what you want and make an actual plan, then take the first step. And the next. Even if it fails, you at least tried instead of stagnating. And pat yourself on the back for \*that\*, because after all of that work, you'll fucking deserve it."
Pretty sure we're all each other's soulmates in that case.
I totally agree and I‚Äôm not arguing that all I‚Äôm saying is everyone deserves respect.
I love me tight pants but some of them look a bit cringy and unprofessional imo. I think a nice fit does it for me
Bullet in the chamber had me üòÇ
"Just treating someone like a person. ‚ÄúThanks but not interested.‚Äù Is sufficient without being rude or an asshole. I‚Äôve just seen a lot of my friends who were treated like dirt because of something outside their control, when all the person had to say what‚Äôs ‚Äúnot interested, thank‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do fems guys.‚Äù"
"Some of the most hurtful things people say to me are ""oh, you're not *really* unattractive,"" or ""you're very attractive to people who get to know you,"" or ""I don't understand why you're still single, you're such a catch!"". 

I've been out of the closet for *30 years*. I've been looking for a man for *30 years*. This means I've had *30 years* to learn that yes, I'm ugly. Yeah, there will be people who want me. They're rarer than a month of Mondays. Understanding that I'm ugly helps a lot because not only does it help me focus on where to find an appropriate guy, but also because it lets me accept the reality that I have always been single and I am still single and I may die single, and all I can do is try to have some fun in the meantime and take what comes along. 

When someone comes along and says ""love yourself more, you can't really say you're not attractive because someone might look at you and think you are"" I just want to scream in frustration because it invalidates everything I've tried to say, based on everything I've learned about myself for *30 years*."

He was very clean actually. Excellent!
"I do, and guys will tell me theyre into that. But half an hour later, theyre grumpy and sassy that my dick isnt inside them yet."
"True that. I think he's so cute too, and I realize I have rarely ever told him that."
Take it one further step and get a restraining order as well. He'll come crawling.
"Yea. I'm so used to dreaming up stuff while feeling or knowing it isn't possible, that I sometimes forget that some of my dreams are actually possible here and now. So then I have to remind myself.

"I knew my current boyfriend (R) from Primary School when we were about 6. We were sort of friends, in the same classes but not much interaction. After we graduated Primary School and headed off our separate ways into High School, our whole class decides that we still need to catch up after graduation, so it becomes a regular thing. A couple times a year our Primary School would catch up for a picnic or later on bars.

When we were all around 20 we went out to a local pub and I sat next to R, as far as I know he's straight and we get chatting about life and how we're both doing. He mentions he went to our local gay bar (lots of straight people go there so no flags) for the first time but had to leave within 5 mins because he injured his hand there. I offered to take him out there again sometime and I thought that would be the end of it.

A few weeks later I was going to go out for a date with a random guy who bailed last minute so instead I asked R if he wanted to join me for a night out. We talked for ages and after a few drinks (or more) at the bars we started kissing behind the main dance floor.

I took him home and he said it was his first time with a guy. We tried to have sex but just ended up talking until the sun came up.

We celebrated our year anniversary a couple months ago."
But he ain't giving well enough because he can't even get his bf off lol
"Yeah, I had a similar experience. I was in middle school and fractured my collar bone playing flag football and was taken to the hospital via ambulance. I remember being in so much pain but the EMT was sooo cute and very comforting and he also held my hand the whole ambulance which distracted me from my pain. He also kept trying to make me laugh with really corny jokes which made me swoon over him even more. I remember thinking, ‚Äúif I‚Äôm not going to make it, this is the best way to go.‚Äù"
He probably needs a gay friend more than anything.
Hello my name is Arthas. I am 25 and I live upon the frozen throne. I have blonde hair and blue eyes. DM if you enjoy purging the entire city. Do not DM if you are Uther.
"I mean, I'm  gay but i can definitely appreciate a nice set of tits. Im not attracted to them, but i cant help but think ""wow, fair play!"" When i see a woman with decent boobs. 

And funny enough a lot of straight guys do the same in some ways. Ive had my ass complemented on by a few straight guys.

You dont necessarily have to be attracted to something to be able to acknowledge its beauty."
"Stop trying to force yourself to move forward. Take your time. Grieve. When you‚Äôre ready, do what works for you (not suicide...if you‚Äôre contemplating suicide get to a hospital)."
"Spot on. 

Kyle: I was super horny so I was initially down, but then felt like something wasn‚Äôt right."
"yes sir, literally every night"

Jesus I‚Äôve never heard that one before. I guess we now suffer together.
"People into pissplay, yeah."
Let that shit out!
"I mean, I assumed it had more to do with the obnoxious stereotypes of the henpecked husband and the √ºberfeminist ‚ÄúI am woman hear me roar‚Äù of the late 80s/early 90s."
"Got a singlet, had to doublet"
Sharing a bed is great on weekend mornings when you‚Äôre just laying around and relaxing. It kind of sucks when you‚Äôre trying to sleep and he‚Äôs tossing and turning.
"I saw a meme about this just a couple of days ago.

The big wigs at CFA have been known to donate money to anti-LGBT groups, including groups that are against gay marriage and adoption, so when my coworkers say that they're getting CFA, I politely tell them that I'm not interested, but that I will be making a donation to Take Children from Straight Parents, a local organization here in Miami that makes *bomb* chicken. That generally drives the point home."
"*Vehemently* disliking an individual by their colloquial pronunciation of a few words makes me wonder if you're putting your energy to good use. 

There are many things to be dislike about a person, especially if you're being critical about aspects of the lgbtq+ community; not sure if it's doing anybody any good to be annoyed by such a smol thing."
"When I was in HS I found a hot college guy who was interested in ‚Äúusing‚Äù me. I pretty much told him whatever goes and that I might resist but I wanted to please him; no matter what. 

I had just gotten my license so I told him I‚Äôd travel over to his place. I showed up, knocked, he opened the door and I walked in. It wasn‚Äôt more than 30 seconds after walking in I realized he invited over two other college guys to join.  

I quickly realized that they weren‚Äôt just there to watch. Long story short, I ended up having both my holes filled for almost an hour. 

I pretty much had to get all three college guys off. One came on my face, the others down my throat. It sucked after the first 20 minutes because my hole was sore as fuck. Throat was getting tired. 

When I think back on it, there‚Äôs nothing that has come close to how hot it was. 

Ahh - to be a teen again"
This is all I needed today.
You can ogle your neighbors in the hall or at the bakery. Someone once told me that you are supposed to block everyone who‚Äôd take up valuable real estate space on your Grindr grid.
"Not really 'a moment' but for me it's when I had sex with three different guy on the same day. Woke up and sucked a guy from Grindr, did my finals and then got fucked by another guy from Grindr, went to a club meeting and then fucked one of my club mates after that.

College was fun."
This guy sounds sketchy. I wouldn't have anything to do with him.
"1. Go to the ER now. You need you start PEP immediately to prevent getting HIV.

2. If you want to report it, you can ask for someone on the force who is trained to work with ""diverse"" citizens to be present. You can bring an advocate or friend with you. They might need to step out but it's helpful to have the morale boost."
but PerSONAlity?
"Hahaha, it was totally necessary for me to point that out, as if the rest of the story made me sound like a saint."
"Maybe sounds stupid, but have always felt that there is some innate comfort and familiarity when it comes to same sex couples and sex or intimacy.  There is something so pure and awesome about the frankness and directness of men.  
  
One example I can think of as an American are the things my bi friends have said about dick.  Most gay men just love dick in a way that a lot of women don't in their experience.  Related to that, none of them have ever had experiences where they've been rejected by men for being uncut but they have had mixed reactions from women."
"&gt;now whenever he sees me he calls me by my mispronounced name 

Could just be jokey

&gt;He immediately offered to take me

Maybe he's just friendly

&gt;i got out to his car he told me he was borrowing his sisters car, which is why there‚Äôs butterfly print sheets over the seats. I laughed and told him it matched his personality and he said, ‚ÄúOh I know! Honestly I might just steal them from her.‚Äù

Gay

&gt;he asked our waiter for an extra plate for me and we shared his waffles. 

The big gay

&gt;he gave me a hug goodbye

gayest"
that escalated quickly :D
I‚Äôm about to (voluntarily) admit myself to a mental hospital to work on my personality disorder üò¨
"That requires some guts, dude. Congrats on asking him out! I'm eager to hear how this turns out, best of luck."
"As a bisexual guy who has dated men and women, I‚Äôve found men are much more comfortable and enthusiastic about the male body. Women often have to get over how a penis looks/feel/behaves. I actually had a girlfriend tell me ‚Äúpenises are just so weird.‚Äù It took her a while to start giving blowjobs and she was never especially good.

But nearly every guy I‚Äôve been with had no hesitation about intimacy. They loved dick and it showed. Blowjobs were 10x better, sex was better overall, there was very little handholding since guys typically know how to pleasure other guys better than women.

It‚Äôs a big reason why I tend to stick with guys rather than girls. There‚Äôs just a lot of extra things to deal with in straight relationships that doesn‚Äôt exist in gay relationships."
"Yep, that's exactly me too. I get lost in my own thoughts ALL THE TIME and they are always me having a better life. 

If I'm not working, that's all that I do lol."
‚Äò‚ÄòTwas the landlord that asked ‚ÄúGrindr?‚Äù
"I don't have casual sex often, but am I the only person who likes to be affectionate with people regardless? Like, If I'm fucking you, we're going to be cuddling afterwards.
How can you fuck someone and not kiss them? That has always blown my mind."
me lol
F
you can hug a pillow and use your imagination
"As I'm a straight lurker, I don't eat there. I think their food is good but I do not want my money to fund their dumb homophobic shit."
I was trying to make a ‚Äúsucking‚Äù pun
"I'm 5'3"" and never thought anyone would consider that as a positive factor so this is nice to hear :)"
"Most gay people go through a tough time trying to accept themselves for who they are due to societal pressure. Once you learn it‚Äôs just fine to be you, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôve conquered this massive obstacle in your life.

You can feel however you want. But if you‚Äôre encountering other gays that are surprised, it‚Äôs probably because they went through hell to finally be able to say to themselves, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay and that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù"
Free speech isn't freedom from consequences of that speech.
"Off the top of my head I know about a university classmate who volunteers at these board game events for young people and I think they're LGBT-friendly (because it gets shared by a pride group on Facebook). But I'll look more into this kind of stuff, I think it'd be helpful for him. Thanks for the suggestion."
I wish I was confident :( The only thing I‚Äôm confident about is winning trivia about fucking Survivor lmao
It‚Äôs just the internet anonymity that turns people into assholes for some reason.
"I learned how much he loves me. I've always had that question when I'm in relationships ""does he really love me?"" when we started living together I noticed that he'll do things that just constantly warm my heart. As simple as drawing a heart on the bathroom mirror so when the bathroom steams, I can see it. Or leaving me notes in things that I'm taking to work. He'll put it in my lunch bag. Every time I wake up at night, he'll ask me if I'm ok.

Yes, there are some things that I could consider annoying, he'll leave his shoes somewhere and I'll trip on them. Or he happens to always miss the laundry basket.

But knowing that I get to wake up next to such an amazing man every morning, makes those annoying things feel like child's play."

"&gt; But this Aaron guy is god damn hot. 

The problem with gays"
"I constantly fantasize about what life would've been like if I came out earlier, at different points in my life. 

Obviously they're hyper-idealized, and I guess at the end of the day I'm just fantasizing about being more mature, confident, and self-actualized earlier in life.

Inevitably, in 5 years or so, I will also fantastize about coming back to this very moment with the maturity and self-awareness that I will have then."
That's just a Tinder meme these days.
"Yeah, üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èOP, you can go to that sub if you‚Äôre looking for an echo chamber"
"Don't shit where you eat. Work place flings can get you fucked three ways from Sunday and you never get to be naked.

Even if he's gay, be careful bro."
"I can do this if I want, but I am picky as fuck and dont like hookups. I get offers every day by people to have sex and I like the ones who dont do this. I dont enjoy casual sex. It feels empty, there is no connection. Feels FAKED."
"YTA

/s"
"It completely depends on the person. For me, monogamy is a prerequisite. It doesn‚Äôt mean the rule won‚Äôt bend a bit at some points in the relationship, but a wide open relationship doesn‚Äôt really feel like a relationship to me. It feels like a long term friend with benefits."
"As someone who is quite short, I've noticed some nice advantages:

For one, whether you're standing, sitting, or lying down, burying and rubbing your face into your partner's chest or neck is easy.

Also, being short (and in my case, small as well), just being in the presence of a taller lover highlights your smallness, which makes me genuinely feel safe and protected, or in certain circumstances, submissive and dominated, which I quite like."
"We have a local pizza chain,Pizza Bell.  The Bell family contributed to the California Prop 8 campaign.  We used to have birthday lunches there.  The next birthday lunch I told the organizer I couldn‚Äôt go and why.  They gladly rescheduled all subsequent pizza lunches at the local Round Table.  I love the people I used to work with.  Don‚Äôt wait until the last minute but ask your boss if you couldn‚Äôt go someplace else.  It‚Äôs your party.  If you get resentment you will know you made the right career move.  Cracker Barrel will still be there.  Maybe everyone can go to Chili‚Äôs or Olive Garden just this once."
Cheers to no meth!
Literally fucking for 4 days straight on crystal meth. No longer into that lifestyle!
Wow. It sounds like he's an asshole.
"I don't mind taking things slow if that's what the other guy wants, but I also don't think how quickly things get sexual has anything to do with how successful the relationship is going to be.

I've definitely had good relationships where things got sexual the first time we hung out."
"You need to empower your brother to self advocate. 

Explain why you think it was a horrible idea. Explain what you think would make sense for how to date, how to meet boys, how to get to know others. 

He needs to understand there are other apps for gay teens, websites for gay teens, and he can get to know gay people without using Grindr.

Teach him that it‚Äôs ok to stand up for himself, and just because another guy is angry doesn‚Äôt mean he has to do something about it."
That high?
I hate how this is considered an anomaly in our community
Honestly I'm gay af but never thought suits seemed sexy.
"I'm terrified thinking about what could've happened to him. It kept me up for a good part of that night. I know 13 year olds don't make the best decisions, hell I'm 18 and I probably still don't, but wonder if he actually understands the danger or if he's just embarrassed that things turned out the way they did. He's a very sheltered and introverted kid and I'm scared he could easily be taken advantage of. He's lucky the guy rejected him."
"Follow the Campsite rule ala Dan Savage.  If there‚Äôa a large age difference, you have to treat them like a campsite.  Make sure you leave them in a better state physically, emotionally, etc.  than you found them in, and under no circumstances damage them."
All he said was that Kyle ate his ass. and short tops and tall bottoms are a thing. this isn‚Äôt the 20th century.
"I wish I could hug you right now. A bear hug ‚ô•Ô∏èüêª I‚Äôm 19 and I feel it. I personally don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ugly really but after years and years of being told I‚Äôm ugly and pasted over by so many guys, I just can‚Äôt help but feel guys won‚Äôt see me the way I see me. 

It‚Äôs always, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre cute for a black guy.‚Äù or something along those lines, always the guy that no one seriously wants. I don‚Äôt want to count my color against me, I don‚Äôt want to look at being black as such a negative anymore but I definitely feel the ugly thing."
"He see's something in you. Don't devalue yourself like that. Looks fade and a healthly relationship is based on more than vanity.

Try to focus on yourself as a whole package, don't reduce yourself down to your looks.

Clearly your bf sees your value as a partner and if he didn't; would you really want yo be with someone that only saw you as arm candy?"
"My fiance died 6 years ago. We were together for 8 years. He was the most amazing person. From 19-25 he was my absolute world.
One day I woke up and he had died in the night.
It took 2 years for me to even consider taking off my engagement ring let alone trying to start healing. I hid from this cruel world and lived alone for 21/2 years.  For the longest time I felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest and the gaping hole was always there, ready to gush blood at any moment.
Time will help. Survivors guilt is hell. Let friends and family help. Just having people around will (very slowly) help.  You can do this
I still think of him. I still love him. Im so sorry this happened to you. The pain feels unbearable. But....
You will be ok. You will be ok. Just not yet. But YOU WILL BE OK.  üíúüíúüíúüò¢"
"When I first started gay dating, I didn't understand this question. Someone would ask me ""What are you into?"" and I would start talking about my hobbies and interests. I didn't realize at first that this was a sexual question."
"You answered your own question in the first sentence. 

&gt;I'm overthinking it.

It's always good to just communicate with people though. If you see him again, just ask him for feedback."
"It doesn‚Äôt sound like OP is hugely cut up about it. Just a learning experience for him.

With wanting to be in the moment, but not knowing what to do other than stare blankly (lol) ‚Äî I feel like there‚Äôs a middle ground where you can have a book/phone/journal open and sort of just show semi-interest in it. Sending the signal you‚Äôve not been stood up, while keeping you open for potential interaction maybe?

And/or eat at a bar area if the bar staff are chatty as others suggest :)"
You do realize that the chances of getting serious with a guy on Grindr is like 20% of the time right?
"my beard is my saving grace. I have a the jawline of a toddler, but with my facial shrubbery it's a lot harder to guess.

when I finally get my ass back to the gym, I'll be the muscle daddy I've always dreamed of being. Then it's over for you bitches... until then, I'll just pine."
I am just not interested in other people.
Chris Evans. Only him and me. I'm not into the other three.
If he‚Äôs not willing to compromise then you know the answer.
"This. It's like we become as effeminate and flamboyant as we can to oppose those people who told us it was *bad* to be like this.

Eventually, we come to an equilibrium. Like all people. I'm almost 40, and right now I coudn't care less of what anyone thinks of me. My fellow straight friends (some of them we've been friends for a couple decades now) act the same. Like, they used to feel like hanging out with a flamboyantly gay man was social suicide, and now they feel stupid for ever considering it the idea. 

People mature. Give'em time."
"‚ÄúHey can we talk about something‚Äù is almost always bad news, lol, why would you phrase it like that?"
"Your are going to date a lot of boys before your settle down.  It's just what happens.  ""Forever"" is a long time until you get a little older and realize it really isn't.  If this other guy is in the stage of his life where he's ready to get serious and settle down with somebody, he's just protecting himself from investing a lot of time in a relationship that he knows will (most likely) end in you wondering what else is out there.  He's afraid to invest the time.  When you're a couple decades older you will understand what I mean.

I wanted love so badly when I was your age.  And then I found it.  And then I kind of realized that I was settling down too early.  Even though I really loved the guy I was with it wasn't enough at the time.  I was young and wanted to experience more guys.  It broke his heart.  It broke my heart to break his heart.  I cried a lot.  It was hard to be selfish because that want the me I wanted to be.  I wondered for a year if I did the right thing.  Turns out I did.  But I hurt him in the process and I still feel like shit to this day for doing so.

You are young.  Keep it fun for a few years yet.  You have plenty of time to find Mr Right."
Hey everyone I appreciate the congrats but I‚Äôve never done meth
"I promised my brother I wouldn't tell our parents about him chatting on a gay app or such specifics. Though honestly, he's 13 and I think he needs to be monitored more closely in general. Like, he plays online games unsupervised a lot, and it's just lucky that he likes telling me about the people he meets there because I can warn him about the fishy stuff. Otherwise, our parents don't look into it much, then they act surprised or outraged when they find out he's keeping secrets from them. I don't know, I might talk to them about taking more interest in what he's doing in general terms. I won't tell them about his potential sexuality. I assured him it's fine to like guys, but meeting with older strangers from apps is extremely dangerous, though he didn't respond. He seemed pretty traumatized by everything in that moment. I'll try talking to him again now that things have calmed down."
"Cute story :)
I really love hand-holding too"
Yes because I‚Äôm not the type :)
Don't use any dating apps at all. It's better to be alone than to hate yourself for doing something that makes you sick.
"breathe, and never share your phone with anyone, not even family.

come out on your own time. eventually you may have to have this conversation. but at the very least, don't share your phone anymore."

"Because we're not a community. The only thing that unites us is that we have same-sex sex. It's tantamount to telling all black people or all white people: hey you guys look the same, how come all whites don't automatically get along, and how come all blacks don't get along?

Think of it like Colonialism. 

My own home country is a former British Colony that experienced a massive surge of ""oneness"" in the 1950s and 60s in order to overthrow the British Colonial power, and were successful! There was happiness and dancing in the streets.....for one year until we realized that we had nothing in common except we vaguely resembled one another...so we descended into civil war. 

The idea of a ""gay community"" was formed around the same time as the civil rights movement and eventually AIDS crisis to demand rights and march in numbers so we could ask for equality. Through this need to unite, a fallacy was born in the social consciousness that we automatically stick together and have one another's back. 

This is not true in the least: hence why as soon as a few rights and concessions were granted, the fetish scene began to take over: the leather man, the cow boy, the goth, the twink, the sub, the dom etc. etc. 

We developed our own internal factions to rebel against being mashed together as a ""community,"" during the initial demand for rights. 

And now here we are, suffering the same internal ructions that every other ""forced"" community has. We are warring and separating the same way a new nation who just discovered post-colonial freedom descends into civil war....except with more glitter and less bombs."

"If I liked them as a person, I wouldn‚Äôt give a damn about if they‚Äôre in a wheelchair or not. A mobility disability may be a major part of a person‚Äôs life by nature, but it doesn‚Äôt define them."
"Yeah I'd be annoyed and weirded out too, I wouldn't want to be with someone sexually that my brother was with, the guy clearly was with you then used the information you gave him to also get at your brother and your brother was unaware you had already seen him"
"Sure, go have fun. Just make sure you use condoms."
