It's a sign you've hit rock bottom when you come to this sub for hook ups.
I've never seen a two year olds head on an 18 year olds body until now...
"Ignore all of these hateful comments. I'd fuck you. I wouldn't tell anyone about it, though."
"I think you misunderstood, he must have said he’s “had an abnormally large penis”."
There is enough oil on your face to power the German Wehrmacht in WW2. 
Ah the old “5 year old in the bath Mohawk”...the punkest type of Mohawk.
He's showing you where the abnormally large penis usually is.
Well when u change genders they can give u what ever size u want
You're so interesting that this post was published 6 hours ago and the only two comments are about that chair. 
Never seen anyone use a chair to masturbate. That's the only hole you'll ever get.
Your streams are better at making me fall asleep than your ASMR videos.
So was this the only way to bring attention to your channel 
"Lol posts on r/amiugly and gets told to GTFO then decides to come here for attention. We get it, your dad doesn't love you enough."
"You look exactly like someone who lives down the street from me. She was a jerk to everyone in elementary school. Thanks for bringing back those memories. 

Edit: Jesus Christ I think it might actually be her"

I was thinking size doesnt matter when you buy it from a shop.
If Moses did Dental. 
"Your ex was generous enough to point us the unfortunate guns that direct dicks to where the hole is. Despite those clear instructions your now ex husband found the hole elsewhere. Now since he isn't around to play with those nipples in two postcodes you came along hoping to scavenge some extra attention and aptly titled it as ""fuck it II"". I suppose one can read it as ""second hand fuck"". Second hand is way to conservative, for who's to say how many hands, dicks and tongues that has seen?

Yet you love ""the"" young people..

You had your day back then, but you couldn't handle the shit that hit you. You ran away, cried in shower and hid under your bed. Once you saw the worthless Reddit gold you came with a bikini to say you're OK.

You will forever receive only the last left over superficial roasts that no one cares to waste on an equally superficial creature like you."
Only thing flatter than your chest is your channel's growth rate.
Oh gosh now I gotta know. Near a park?

"I saw ""II"" in your post so I had to go look it up, which meant looking at your post history. So roasting aside, I'm going to be honest here.

There are a lot of people here who insult and get insulted all in good fun, but you and those like you who do it in order to get attention, to stay in focus, are honestly the lowest rung of the internet social strata. You must be in the spotlight, you feel any small amount of attention brings you validation and confirms to yourself that you have a role in the world.

Unfortunately that isn't the case, nobody cares outside of the moment. Internet attention is fleeting, it burns through content at a rapid pace. If your contributions are topical and inane, limited to a few artless pictures and medeocre comments then you are little more than the intrest of the hour, if that.

Look at your history, you've already tried the cute animal route, a route already saturated with content. You've tried the softcore porn route, another route that churns out hourly content, and slobbered over by sexless neckbreards because it is the closest they will come to actual fucking. Is this the following you want? Are these the people that make you feel like you have a place in this world?

Judging by your history and attention grasping nature, if you continue unchanged I predict you will be doing anal on cam in a year, not for tips, just to feel like someone cares."
