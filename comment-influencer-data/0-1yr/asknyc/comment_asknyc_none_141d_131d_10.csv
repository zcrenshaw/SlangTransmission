"&gt;What is Staten islands reputation

Terrible. It’s reputation is terrible."
The smaller machines often only take credit cards and the lines at some of the popular stations are full of tourists who only have or only want to use cash. Also there's a sort of groupthink mentality that happens to some people when they see lines and they assume the one that has no line is broken.
"Ah, Staten Island. Only place in nyc I’ve been called the n-word! So there’s that. Also lots of MAGA signs."
I always use seamless for the menu then call to order. Almost every place bumps up the pricing on seamless because they take a big cut. A call takes a minute and can save 20%.
"Electricians and plumbers and other technical jobs are really good jobs. They are highly skilled and always needed. They make good money.


Also, it's really densely populated. It's not like you have one plumber driving everywhere to service 8 million people. 


Yes. It's hard for poor people to survive. A lot of people are ""rent poor,"" spending too much on housing, and commuting a far way...usually by public transit, not car."
"It has the opposite effect. When I go to other cities, I find it weird how short their buildings are."
hey it's me ur son
Honestly seems like a bad idea. Getting around the city is going to be a nightmare for your daughter.
Passport is universal. Everything else will probably look like a fake
"To me, nothing, my super is the coolest fucking dude in the world. He knows everyone for a 4 block radius, he literally constructed the unit I live in himself, he’s funny, kind, he always compliments my girlfriend in a respectful way that makes her feel good about herself and not creeped out. He’s the Puerto Rican uncle I always wanted. He also builds and tests race cars on the block.. so.. it can get loud at any moment."
Wasn’t that George Costanza‘s million-dollar-idea?
"Put it on the sidewalk, it will be gone in 4 hours."
Those are the nicest gypsy cabs i've ever heard of.

Maybe try the Islamic Center at NYU? [https://www.icnyu.org/](https://www.icnyu.org/)   It's open to the public as long as you provide ID.
"Lousy coffee at a bodega/korean grocery, get on a crowded subway go sit in a box/cubicle for a few hours, go outside buy some mystery meat at a food cart. Go back to box, move to other box, sit on toilet play with phone. Eventually, get back on crowded train, get take out food near home/hotel. Watch lousy TV drink to excess, pass out. Repeat."
"My old super was the super of pretty much every building on the block. On trash days, starting at 4 am, you'd hear a running commentary of everyone's garbage, ranging from ""Hey, who put that here, that goes in recycling"" to ""aww hell, put your tampons in the garbage bag, don't just throw them in the can!""


I miss you, Vito"
"You know how the Nazi's fled to Argentina after the war?  Staten Island is where the MAGA, conservative and ""old-schooler's"" have been hiding out for the last couple of post-Reagan decades.  Lots of cops and firefighters ... the white ones."
"The Center will be organizing Ramadan services and Iftar in May:

https://gaycenter.org/communityiftar/

The organizers of the event may be able to put you in touch with more regular resources for LGBTQ+ Muslims."
"I'll admit the faces of done of the people when I used the smaller machine today and got my card in a couple minutes were absolutely hilarious. I don't think they were all trying to use cash, I think it's the groupthink line thing.."
"It takes about a year of effort to build a solid network of acquaintances here. I don’t think this is as much about NYC as it it about adult relationships being harder to cultivate. You need to find events and places to be a regular at and you need to make an effort to connect with people at those things. It’s not easy, but it is really mostly about exerting consistent effort."
I have a dentist that I’ve been going to for years and have recommended to anyone who asks. Never up sells or pushes you into things. One friend was told she needed 7 fillings so she went to my dentist for a second opinion. He told her 2 or 3 needed to be filled by the rest could wait and be watched.  I’m a firm believer in not drilling into your teeth until necessary so I’ve always appreciated this about him.
Yeah talk to this person
[The Door](https://door.org/) offers services to young people up to age 25. They are located at 555 Broome &amp; 6th Ave.
"Go to either side of the island, the park, or a gym. 

Running on sidewalks is just going to be infinitely frustrating to you, everyone else, and be a poor workout."
"Get the Citimapper app, plug in the address of Costco and yours and it will give you an estimate of how much Uber would cost.

Pay them at least the same, a bit more for the extra help."
Sharing an opposite type of story: I've lived in NYC since 2001. My parents live in the suburbs in a small midwestern city. If I stay with them I get freaked out about how quiet it is all the time and how you can't walk anywhere.
18% and it feels good.  Im in brooklyn though
New York City is a hundred thousand small towns walking distance from each other. Shop local for a while. Get to know your neighborhood.
"so much this. My wife and i would always place the same order from this little mexican place and it would be like 25 bucks. One day that same order suddenly cost 40 bucks. i was shocked. We did some investigating and realized that only the prices on seamless went up, a direct order kept the price the same. Now we check every time before we place a seamless order and 90% of the time, it's cheaper to call the restaurant. It's annoying to give your Credit Card info every time but there's no way the convenience of a saved credit card is worth 20-40% being added to the order."
OK.  If paying 20% more is worth it to you to not have to read your credit card number then it is worth it to you.
"It’s reputation isn’t too great. It is the only borough that voted for Trump in 2016, and that kind of just played into already existing stereotypes about it being a predominantly white, highly conservative area. It also has a bit of a Jersey Shore reputation, which shows like Mob Wives and whatever that new show about it is called contribute to. 

In reality, though, it is more complex. SI is predominantly white to be sure, but on the north shore there are plenty of majority-minority communities, and it isn’t homogenous in most other areas either. Politically, in 2018 the House seat for SI flipped blue, I believe Max Rose’s military service played a large role in that. However, despite its reputation, the island has a 5:3 registered Dem:Republican ratio, albeit with a lot of Reagan Democrats mixed in there. Almost everyone knows someone that works for the city on SI, be it a cop, firefighter, sanitation worker, or other. 

As for the “Jersey Shore” reputation, a lot of that comes from the South Shore. The island gradually becomes more and more suburban and Jersey-esq as you work your way south, which makes sense geographically. The north shore can easily resemble parts of Brooklyn or Queens depending on where you are, or just a slightly more residential version of them. The mid island area is more akin to the parts of Long Island closer to Queens in its layout. I don’t want to generalize abt LI because outer Suffolk and inner Nassau are so different from each other. Then, as I said, the south shore is basically a slightly ore urban New Jersey suburb. The shifts are gradual between neighborhoods and it is interesting how you see the changes slowly happen as you drive north-south on the island. 


All this is to say that SI’s reputation isn’t good, and it is partially earned and partially based on stereotypes."
"East River Ferry is pretty neat, the ride requires no walking but getting to and from the ferry could be a trip worth an Uber if you’re not too far. Plays and shows could be another option as well. 


Smorgasburg is back as well. Friday’s at World Trade Center, and you could take them up to see the view from the observatory before or after eating."
"As a parent of a disable child in NYC, a couple of things:  

* I think your thing about not living in ""family focused"" places is very naive, you really should think about it, especially with a disabled child.  The community around you will help tremendously, especially with parents going through the same thing.  You will find out more about services, schools, etc. from them.

* You will need to get an IEP from the city and mostly likely pay for a private psych exam.  There are a couple of them that everyone uses.  **$$**

* Once you get your private psych exam, you will now need a lawyer.  Once again, there are basically two education lawyers that everyone uses.  You need the lawyer to be your advocate to ""sue"" the BOE for the proper amount of services for your child.  If they are going to be taken out of the classroom most of the day, then you will need to find a private school that the BOE will pay for.  Some schools do this for you once you're in each year, some you might have to do it each year.  **$$**  

Don't get discouraged if this is the right thing for your family, but be prepared for lots to do initially.  NYC is a great place to raise children."
"Please do not feel pressured EVER to give money to the panhandlers/beggers on the street. 

&amp;#x200B;

This includes weird dudes walking up to you to sell you candy or their shitty mixtape. Also do not give money to ""monks"" that walk up to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just walk away and continue walking. They can shout/scream whatever they want, just continue fast walking"
"Agreed, I think a lot of people in this thread are not aware of daily issues and problems there are for for those with disabilities. Even something like a wheelchair not fitting through a door! As stated above, my brother is severely disabled and we must push him in wheelchairs. It would be doable for him to live in NYC but it would also be incredibly difficult. NYC has such an outdated infrastructure and yes, there are ADA guidelines but many places are not up to code or maintain the code."
"Your daughter will get services through OPWDD in New York.  Check opwdd.ny.gov for general information about how to get services.  She can be at a district 75 school but since not a lot of schools here are accessible, options for kids who use wheelchairs are limited.  There are achools run by non-profits that can be a good (and free) option as they are covered under IDEA.  
You can this site too or call the agency to see if they can give more detailed advice

(I generally do adult services but feel free to pm any questions)

I also have kids in nyc and its pretty nice being able to find activities for them.  Its not a bad place for kids.

Don’t trust that subway elevators are always working.  Buses have lifts and there is also Access-a-ride that provides van service."
"I wish more people actually realized this.

On top of that, the restaurant is keeping a larger cut, which is good for them too (and your neighborhood)."
"I was just thinking about this... For me, I'd say about 25% and I'm comfortable with that. I once read that you shouldn't be spending more than 1/3 or 30% of your monthly pay on rent. But even that seems hard here.."
"I'm done with Seamless now that they started adding random charges to orders and calling it a 'service fee' even when they advertise free shipping.  They don't disclose the fee up front and won't explain how it's calculated or what it's for. Bye, Seamless!"
"I was sitting in a college geography class when the professor started taking about Staten Island. She started discussing the idea of adding boros as a joke. Within minutes Staten Island was voted out of NYC in exchange for Nassau of Westchester.

So in conclusion: Not great."

"Lol, this guy wants to spend millions on a brownstone for his son and you're suggesting shitty places to live."
Tell your friends to meet you at Amity Hall this Monday. It's a bar that has a meetup every week where we play board games. It's a lot of fun.
Chocolate covered peanut butter pretzels. Mochi nuggets. Speculoos cookies
"My old super would come into my room a few times a day without knocking and tell me to get a real job, study and stop playing video games. Thanks Mom."
"There are many people who live in rent regulated and/or subsidized apartments either they or their family have been living in for decades.  Some may have won an affordable housing lottery. There is no one concentration of those units. They are scattered all around the city. Some people may live with higher earning family members. Some people own their homes which were purchased long ago. And there are areas of upper Manhattan that are attainable to couples with two blue collar salaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

For service people who commute, they generally either work for a service company that has a route concentrated in one neighborhood or for one building or complex  full time. They would not travel hours to fix a single light and then return home. They could have a 1-3 hour commute but generally would work a full day within a concentrated area or at a single job-site."
"It's funny, I've noticed this too and always use them. Their touchscreens are miles faster and more responsive as well. Probably less dirty too."
"The median household income in Manhattan in 2012 was 66k/year. 

Manhattan is large, but the subway also connects the other boroughs and people commute to work from there. I live in Queens. My husband used to have a job driving food trucks from the huge parking lot near our apartment into various parts of Manhattan where he would park them, load the meter and bounce. Guys who worked the trucks would come in from far reaches of the city and open it later. 

Lots of other folks live far out and commute long ways to their jobs."
Some museums rent wheelchairs - might be worth looking at for your favorites.
"Yah, sorry, fuck all.

Getting anywhere and back in 4 hours is pushing it into dicey territory.  Like, yes, you could take a cab into the city, and it'd take you between 30-60 mins depending on how fucked traffic is, leaving him with 2 hours to reasonably do something.  He could also pick anything in Queens and have around the same amount of time.  Or, he can just stay in the airport, get Shake Shack (It still counts as ""NYC"" food, right? despite being everywhere now), and just not sweat it."
Uber is relatively inexpensive.  So... give them $15 and you're good to go.
"[David Brisman](https://www.davidbrismandmd.com/). He accepts insurance (not sure which ones) and also offers his own “insurance” which, if I remember correctly, is like $300 for 3 cleanings and discounts on any xrays and maybe even procedures? I’ve been going to him for almost 6 years and I can’t recommend him enough. Also my hygienist is great and thorough."
These are great because they make me feel like I’m making healthy choices when in reality they’re as bad for me as eating candy.
Found the baller.
"Staten islands infliction is it has three bridges to NJ and one to NY. Worse yet, there isn't even a pedestrian walkway making SI difficult to reach for everyone including NY'ers. So the only methods to reach SI is by car or ferry. I wish one of the many proposed rail plans had happened and SI was connected to manhattan or brooklyn via a subway tunnel. I'm sure the SIR gets lonely at times, jealous of its distant single letter and numbered cousins.

Though I'll say this, it's actually a very interesting borough. For example, did you know there's a 300 year old preserved farm town complete with dirt roads and restored buildings? When I found out I was floored, It's beautiful. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Richmond_Town

It also holds the last bits of the remaining natural forest of NYC.

Plus go on a satellite viewer and look at some of the odd real estate configurations around the island. It's kind of a wild NYC seemingly free of development cancer. Though it has a totally different culture and feels more like a suburb such as Nassau or upstate."
"Honestly I think L Train Vintage is still pretty good. I know its crowded and its in the city but I have gotten a real deal leather coat for 20 bucks and a giant leather coach bag for 30, and I got that fairly recent. Their other stores are not as good and more vintage/hipster so its more expensive. The one in the city downtown is the best one."
Hey man feel good about that. Saying you’re in Brooklyn doesn’t mean much for price these days. We have friends in Fort Greene that pay more for their 1br than we do for our 2br.
"I wouldn’t register in NY.  If you get pulled over or questioned, just mention that you’re only visiting."
"Nice, safe, gentrified, expensive."
"You can just visit Goodwill and Salvation Army. I've seen some pretty good brands like Uniqlo, J.Crew, Patagonia and even designer brands like Gucci. It's harder to find stuff but it also is way cheaper than thrift shops. If you are a female, then there's even more clothing to sift through, which is even better."
NYC has got to be one of the least accesible cities. It’s fucked if you have a disability.
"Expensive af I agree, but the quality of care of the horses is very good and highly regulated.  The horses have a guaranteed retirement and mandatory 5 weeks vacation per year.  They're essentially rescues in the sense that nearly all are either draft horse discards from Amish country where they work a hell of a lot harder with no oversight and ex-harness racing Standardbreds who have only very niche careers available to them after they retire from the track.  Both are totally desensitized to road traffic and busy environments.  

I'm a 25+ year equestrian, formerly professional, and every carriage horse I've seen in the Park has been in good weight with a healthy coat and good feet.  Non equestrians seem to believe that a horse's life outside of NYC means life in a large field all day but that reflects a reality for very, very few horses.  Horses, like dogs living in apartments as opposed to living on farms, can and do easily adapt to their environments as long as their exercise requirements are met and they have a daily routine that suits their temperament.

Much of the public concern about the care of the carriage horses stems from a public awareness campaign spurred by real estate interests looking to capitalize on the land where the stables are located: [https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/12/27/as-real-estate-exec-sought-carriage-ban-he-pitched-affordable-housing-near-stables-161599](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/12/27/as-real-estate-exec-sought-carriage-ban-he-pitched-affordable-housing-near-stables-161599)"
