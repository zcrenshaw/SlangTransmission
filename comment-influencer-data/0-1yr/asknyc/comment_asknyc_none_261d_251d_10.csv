"philly. the mta and the realization that it made me start and end my day with unneeded stress and pain, and the realization that i was making concessions in every other part of my life to live there, to the point where it was holding me back from literally everything (buying a house, having time for hobbies, easily doing...anything at all...) is what made me leave.

I now own a 3 story, 3 bedroom house, brand new, finished basement with washer dryer, with a roof deck,  15 minute commute to my job in center city, 5 minute walk to some of the top restaurants and bar in philly... and my mortgage payment is nearly identical to what i was paying in rent for a 450 sq ft 1 bedroom in BK.

Theres no place like NYC though. I love it but I was giving it more than it was giving me, so it was time to break up with it."
"Yes, it's worth it.  I work in property management and I have always maintained coverage because of what I've learned from my job.

Fire in your building and the fire hoses flood all your stuff?  Renters' insurance should cover it and may cover a hotel room for you as well.  Bed bugs and have to throw out your mattress and couch?  Renters' insurance should cover the expense.  Ceiling collapses and ruins your bed? Renters' insurance.  Got robbed?  Renters' insurance will replace your lost items.

Your landlord is not responsible for covering your damages for any of the above. That's what the renters' insurance is for."
You’re supposed to carry your trash either to a public can or to garbage at your destination. You are definitely not supposed to leave it on the curb or randomly junk it in other people’s bins.

"When I was a teen this homeless guy came up to me on the subway, said I was high, and started pushing me. Luckily my uncle was with me and grabbed him, practically threw him off the train once he saw what was going on. 

My dad was also there and did nothing. Thanks dad. "
"You’re fine.

Don’t worry about the stop line, what matters here is that the vehicle is not over the crosswalk. Here’s a [link](https://newyorkparkingticket.com/crosswalks-stop-lines/) that explains this with pictures."
"I don’t regret it, but I know many who do.  These “regretters” usually share common beliefs/attitudes.  

1.  Unrealistic expectations of “making it”.  They believed opportunities fall out of the sky in NYC. This is false.  You have to work very hard to make it here, regardless of what industry you’re in.  

2.  They believed they were talented.  In NYC, everyone is talented.   Ok, so you were talented in your small town.  That doesn’t mean shit here.  

3.  They couldn’t handle the tougher aspects of life in NYC.  Crowded subways, small apts, expensive cost of living, etc.  

These people usually stay 2-5 years, then leave in exactly the same, or worse, financial situation as when they first arrived.  Don’t be these people."
My family and I will be at JFK for 3 hours. We've never been to NYC and want to see the sights. How many hidden gems can we see? 
LI. Kids need space. Turns out I love having a basement and garage. 
"I had a guy threatening to stab me at the 1/2/3 72nd st station for being ""too close"" waiting for the 2/3.  I moved about 30ft away and he was still yelling at me so I hopped on the 1 to avoid him.  

Avoiding them really seems the only sane course of action."

"Holy moly... the bare minimum for a 1 bedroom that I've seen lately is $1750... so if your SO declines, can I have it???"
I actually love this post. please dont delete it.

"Depends on how far you travel. If it's a short haul, bagels and half-moon cookies have always been warmly received.

For longer distances, bring coffee from Birch (roasted in LIC) or Mud, dishware from Fishs Eddy, knicknacks or interesting candy/grocery items from Chinatown, something from the MoMA giftshop.

And don't forget that everyday stuff you take for granted might be cool to outsiders, too. I had a tween cousin who was fascinated by the city and subway — I gave him an empty MetroCard and subway map (free at any MTA booth and actually pretty cool-looking) and he proudly displayed it on his wall for years."
If you like to run there is a 4 mile organized run in central park that starts at midnight. I think you have to register before noon today.
"You should 100% get it.      

I pay $7/month for 2 people with $20,000 in coverage and it covers liability.

I gotta place ya can hide a gem ya dirty bum.
"My first move was in 2007, I was really down on my luck financially and rents were going up so I moved to Memphis. Then I moved in with some friends in north Alabama for a bit, then back to Memphis. I really just traveled a lot throughout the south during that year. I liked some aspects of it (food, mostly) but the south overall was just a toxic, isolating place. People were very fake-friendly, nobody felt really honest with each other. That was the biggest thing I missed about NYC, people were very up front with each other. 

I moved back to Brooklyn in 2008, I just missed it too much. 

In 2011, I got stressed out from the city and thought again that I should move. I moved in with my good friend who had moved to northern virginia. Right away I started to miss NYC, even though the first 3 weeks were insanely nice because I was away from all the stress, I really missed all of the stuff NYC had to offer culture wise. Also the same fake-friendliness was there, except more suburban instead of rural. Once again, I got drawn back to Brooklyn. Having the big house, the basement, the garage etc, was very nice, but it didn't compare to having an actual urban neighborhood which you could be in. Suburbs are dreadful except for the houses themselves. 

In 2013-2014, for work, I moved all around Europe. I study criminology and we had to do a whole research project on crime in european cities for my job. It took over a year. We mostly did France, Spain, and Germany, but I spent the majority of my time in London. I suppose because I was in big, major cities, I didn't miss NYC as much. London isn't too different from NYC, albeit less dense. However, when I got back to NYC, I suddenly got a wave of happiness. I didn't even realize how much I had missed the city honestly until I got back. 

Really, I've come to the conclusion that I am likely gonna be here forever. I came here from USSR in the 90s and have been in Bushwick for 22 years give or take. Im probably gonna be one of those old fucks playing chess in the park and yelling at young people in a few decades. "
"Definitely don’t regret moving here. Sometimes I really hate living here. The more time goes on, the more I miss slower parts of my last city. But getting the chance to move here and have fun is rare. It’s a tough city but if you get the chance, absolutely do it. You don’t have to stay here forever, but even a short stint here is pretty eye opening and I think something you can always look back on fondly. 

Also I think if/when I move back “home” I won’t have that nagging feeling, “I wish I lived in NYC or somewhere exciting before setting down...”"
Sounds like the premise of a Kramer subplot.  You should do it. Worst case scenario someone stops you. Wear some kind of neon vest and pretend you’re a city worker for some obscure power washing department.
"Jersey. My monthly rent for a studio apartment got me a house. Don't get me started on the grocery prices. Just couldn't financially keep up, nevermind get ahead. "
"I miss Ruby's Books on Chambers Street, FAO Schwarz, Pearl Paint, Love Saves the Day and for pure teenage reminiscing, I'd love if someone would re-open Yellow Rat Bastard in the exact format it had in 1997"
"I’m a born and raised New Yorker... I’ve been thinking about moving to Philly for a while now, your story is giving me a renewed sense of dedication. You’re completely right... there is such a level of stress simply from living in NYC, I’m not sure it’s worth it anymore"
"I don’t know the man in question, but I just want to say that this is one of the New Yorkiest of posts in this sub.  I love it."

"Seattle area. Lived in NY my entire life and just wanted a change. Got a job offer for more money which has significantly improved the standard of living for my wife and I (we weren't struggling before but certainly didn't live lavishly). The pay increase was compounded by no state/city income tax which helps even more. 

I've never felt more relaxed and we found out we love the outdoors. My 45+ minute train commute is now a 10 minute drive or if I want to exercise in the morning a 20 minute run. We couldn't afford a car in NY, but having one for groceries and random trips is very useful. 

I just couldn't handle the stress of the city anymore and felt like I explored all I wanted as I can always come back to visit. West Coast living is awesome and I wouldn't go back. Housing is still expensive as in any major city but at least I have a 2 bed apartment with a parking garage in the building for $75/month. "
"Dude. This is not some sort of common thing. I have lived here for 30+ years and have fought 0 homeless people. You're overthinking it. Just don't walk around looking like a rube and no one will bother you.

Also there's something dehumanizing when we talk about homeless people as if they're all one glance away from attacking you. Yes, many of them have mental health issues and that can be scary. But you're just as likely - or more likely - to get an offer to fight from some drunk bro who makes $150k a year and wants to prove he's tough."

"What's the problem with being ""those people?"" They take a big risk, it doesn't work out, they cut their losses. How is that hurting anyone?"
"Apparently they are doing it in some neighborhoods to stop illegal dumping: [https://abc7ny.com/society/residents-say-trash-can-removal-not-helping-litter-problem/4021360/](https://abc7ny.com/society/residents-say-trash-can-removal-not-helping-litter-problem/4021360/)

It might be worth contacting your Council person about."

"Worth mentioning - a lot of renters insurance also covers your belongings, even outside of your apartment. For instance if my laptop gets stolen or broken in Europe, it's covered. Mine also covers injuries at my apartment or damage to others' property, as well as associated medical bills. (I have Jetty, $170/yr)"
You need this new car service called Goober.  Ask them for the special Times Square tour including a meal at the Olive Garden.

"Amazing.  I grew up in Queens and went to school in Manhattan most of my life.  It was the perfect balance of community feel and big city life.  Queens (and the outerboros in general) have a really strong community feeling.  You grow up with everyone knowing each other: the corner deli, Chinese food spot, pizza place, barber, mechanics, etc.  They all see you grow up and know your parents and family.  It’s a cool feeling going to a busy pizzeria and having everyone know you (and know you since you were a baby).  That’s why gentrification is a big deal because the close knit neighborhoods get broken apart.  

Against this backdrop, you have the freedom that comes with the city.  Taking the subway and bus from when you were a little kid and going wherever you wanted.  You grow up pretty independent and street smart since most kids in the city are exposed to much at a young age.  I was already taking the subway alone by the time I was 12 years old.  By that age I knew how to navigate the subways and streets of the city better than tourists or new transplants who were much much older.  You also get exposed to so many different people and cultures that you become very accepting of people.  You learn to accept people’s weidness as long as they are good at heart and treat you well.

Now that I’m an adult, it’s funny to think back on being 14 and deciding that you were craving Cambodian food today for lunch instead of middle eastern shwarma or Crown Fried Chicken.  I don’t think most kids grow up in America with such a varied palate."
"This is a charming question! I always like to dress up for the theatre in a nice (but not overly fancy) dress and heels, and you will see many guys in suits or business casual. However I do that because it's fun for me, I like making it an event. It's definitely not required and you will also see plenty of people wearing super causal clothes like jeans or even sweats — matinees especially are less formal as people are likely to be sightseeing or shopping beforehand, not coming from dinner or work.

Pretty much anything you see people wearing on the streets in NYC, you'll see them wearing at the theatre. Dress up only if it makes the experience more special for you, otherwise come as you are. Enjoy your visit!"
Find a local joint.  Meet your neighbors.  Or at least the ones that you'll be drinking with in the future.
"&gt;No wonder people don’t pick up after their dogs if you can walk for blocks without finding a trash can. 


Dog shit on the sidewalk has nothing to do with the city removing trash cans.   If that was the issue then there would be bags of shit strewn about not fresh sidewalk turds every fifteen feet.


Dog shit is all over the sidewalk because NYC dog owners are entitled brats.  


This dog nonsense is getting fucking crazy.   I went to Duane Reade yesterday and I swear there were nine dogs in the fucking store. "

"“Always and never” is really true. I’m from NYC &amp; metro area and honestly, I’m kind of over it at this point. I want to love NYC but I’m just so frustrated. I’m not a huge fan of tourists and there are so many tourists and dumb undergrads who moved here from other places (they’re just one step above tourists for the first 3 years, imho) everywhere, and all of the things I used to love are either gone or on their way out due to crazy prices.

Also because NYC is so transient, most of my friends from growing up are gone, and it’s so hard to make new friends because nobody plans on sticking around for more than a few years.

Also when you do finally make friends, they’re all probably like 45 minutes away in opposite directions. I’ve had a hell of a time making a friend group that isn’t even that large.

Add that to a completely *stupid* price of living and the constant ineptitude of everyone (from the MTA to people unable to figure out how to walk on a sidewalk correctly) and I’m just... over it. 

Edit: I was fine with all this until I took an internship in a small town in Virginia and then suddenly made a friend group within 3 days and was able to buy anything I wanted (ok within reason, I couldn’t buy a Tesla but like, I could afford the bougie yogurt brand!!! A ton of it! I could eat expensive yogurt every day if I wanted!), and actually *do* things, both with friends and just with my dog. Now I’m ruined because I know what it’s like to live with the bougie yogurt and a community of people and I miss it"

Look up open houses on SteetEasy and drop in in a few. I did that 6-months before moving to get a feel for what my budget would get me in different neighborhoods and found it really helpful.
"I don’t know about “hidden gems“ per se but for me, Christmas in NYC has always been a great day to grab some dim sum, see a movie, and hit up an Irish bar."
"Call the police. Given her age and that she’s only been missing 3 hours, chances are this will not be given a high priority. But if it gets to be more than 24 hours, then the alarms will kick in and they’ll treat this more seriously. Hope all ends well. "

Found her but not before the police took a report. Basically just irresponsibility on her part. Fortunately nothing more than that
"Go to Tokyo and then tell me they're are no trash cans in NYC.

Amazingly, Tokyo has next to no litter. It's incredible what a little social responsibility gets you."
I was weed wacking at 8am in a park on the West Side Highway and I evidently got too close to a homeless man eating spaghetti. He tried to fight me for ten minutes while we argued and i kept the weed wacker between us. Finally he backed off and a big weird Russian guy started teasing him with a cigarette. You get attacked once in a while if you work in a park.
