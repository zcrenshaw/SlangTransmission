Sbarros pizza in Times Square is the closest to the best pizza I found in a mall in Wichita
"Three times day and for your father and me, and on weekends I always make extra for you.  You never visit your mother!
"
Because they are parasitic scum of the earth.
"I’m from Mexico and really like “ taco no. 1” they have 2 locations . Chelsea market and Times Square . In addition to that , they have a Mexican seafood restaurant that is super authentic . It’s called “ los mariscos “ also in Chelsea market . I highly recommend all of those "
i’m still broke. 
"$100/night just isn't do-able in the city for a hotel room for 4 adults. At $150ish you are at the very low end of the range. So you might be in a less-nice unit, but you aren't going to be able to be too picky.

I would figure out what you want to do first, and then find a central location for your hotel. Then just shop based on price.  You don't have to have a detailed itinerary, but just a general idea of where you want to spend each day like ""dinner in little italy"" or ""walking through central park""

The weather in March should be good for walking around the city with light coat on. "
"Look at Long Island City for hotels--sounds far, but it's just a few stops from Midtown. "
"&gt; Do they really not value a potential tenants time? 

LOL"
"Veselka (Ukrainian) is pretty damn close to Polish cuisine. Christine's in Greenpoint IS Polish cuisine, but that's in Greenpoint so it's cheating."
For Albania &amp; the Balkans (Southeastern Europe)    “Cka Ka Qellu” in the Bronx is highly recommended.
"You should know that New Yorkers are not rude. We just have someplace to go and you're generally in our way.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want directions to somewhere, just ask. Most NYers will tell you.  We're not going out of our way to ask if you're lost."
Dunkin wants $1.50 for a donut now 
Cook everyday. 28. In the neighborhood with noisy neighbors.
"The times we live in have normalized ghosting. Happens across the board.

Best thing you can do is contact a local real estate certification board and let them know about the agent in question. They can have their credentials pulled."
"Brazilian here. All of the big churrascarias / all you can eat BBQ places are decently authentic. I am biased towards Fogo de Chao because they are an actual brazilian chain.

For a more normal experience that you would get in an upscale brazilian restaurant, Emporium Brasil is my absolutr favorite. They have all you can eat buffets on saturday as well. If you want more of a bar experience there is also Beco in Williamsburg which is a hidden gem."
NYU is a real estate investment firm that runs a school as a side business. Don't be fooled by the hype. 
"I would think someone wearing that shirt is a try hard edgelord, but I don’t disagree with the messaging."
Had one of the more surreal apt viewings of my life last year when I showed up to my confirmed 8:30am appointment only for the agent to not show up. I called her &amp; she told me to just ring all of the buzzers &amp; wait for someone to let me in bc the apt itself was unlocked. 
Hahah did you make your account just to reply to this? I hope to see you keep on going 
"If you do, tip to reflect the extra work. 25%+

Although this sub has devolved into fights about whether or not you even have to tip delivery people. "
"26 in Gowanus, I cook most food for myself. Breakfast/lunch/dinner on the weekends, and I do a large dinner on Sunday for the next few weekdays.

To those who don't cook, how the fuck can you afford to seamless/eat out so much"
Sybil's in Queens has the best Guyanese food and pastries. 
If you or your mother are patients contact the New York State Department of Health.
You sure? Looks like you post in alt right subs a lot and you really like the Timberwolves. Why would you move from Minnesota to NYC if you will be making minimum wage?
You'll forgive me if I don't take cuisine advice from someone called u/DiarrheaPenis...
"I wasn't minimum wage but our entire unit of six was laid off and operations were moved to Jersey. 

The three people in our unit who were making over minimum wage were laid off along with three people from another unit, who were replaced with our minimum wage people. "
that’s a really weird wya if explaining the literal difference between a cappuccino and a latte
"Vietnamese here - I like Sao Mai, Hanoi House in EV; An Choi in LES; Banh Mi Sai Gon and Cong Ly in Chinatown; and Thanh Da in Sunset Park."
Anyone making $15 previously who is now making minimum wage?
"Always. Tip. Your. Delivery. Person.

(Unless they really fuck up for some reason that isn't related to weather conditions.)"
Michael Scott?
"I’m from Canada and the closest I’ve found to legit poutine with actual cheese curds is at Hero burger on the UES.

My husband is from the UK and he is a fan of the English breakfast and banoffee pie at Jones Wood Foundry"
You’re gonna come off as a try hard . And nyc is one of the most liberal cities is the u.s so you ain’t making any statements with that shirt on you’re just feeding to the crowds . It would take more balls to wear a MAGA hat I think 
"&gt; I can stand $100-150 a night.

Is that for the whole family, per room (how many rooms), per person?
"
This is a very good suggestion.
"For actual Ukrainian cuisine, Ukrainian National Home according to my significant other."
"I was making $14 and was actually bumped up to $16 to stay over minimum. 

I had already put in my two weeks before I knew about this, but I think it'll take a few months before any of us really see the results."
"With a budget of $100-$150 a night, I'd say don't be afraid to look outside of Manhattan.  Look in Queens and Brooklyn hotels within a few subway stops of Manhattan.  You'll probably have a better experience with that than a place at that price point in Manhattan (which would be difficult to find to begin with.)"
My Georgian friend raves about Oda House. 
"25, UES, cook about 3x a week, making portions large enough that it'll last a few days."
"Grew up on Holland, and Whole Foods has surprisingly authentic Stroopwafels."
how's life as an oligarch
"Gloves, scarf, warm jacket, warm shoes. You don’t need to buy snow boots specifically because you won’t need them this week. It is cold but if you dress appropriately there is no reason to stay inside all day. "
Xo cafe on Hester st in Chinatown for authentic Cantonese food 
"Hard disagree on mighty quinn’s, from Texas and both times i’ve been there have been disappointing "
Saved this post.

"\^This, most people will gladly give you directions. And also, if you want to stop to take pictures of anything please pull over to the side of the sidewalk to do so before stopping your walk."
Lol obvious bait post. Boss will take away hours no matter what.
"If nobody ordered delivery in this type of weather, the delivery people would be sitting around not earning any money.  "
"A lot of places that were about to go under anyway, blamed the increase in minimum wage.  Or used it as a reason to raise prices.  That way they have something to tell customers who complain about the price increase."
"helped me because my boss actually cut my hours in order to pay me the same amount of weekly salary. Granted, this is a plus because I'm doing full time work + school. Now I am doing less hours at work, working for the same amount of $, have more hours for schoolwork / sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, it'll take a few months maybe to see real effects as cost of daily spending may increase due possible increase in cost of groceries etc. "
Fedoroff's Roast Pork in Williamsburg has the best cheesesteaks and roast pork sandwiches I've ever had outside of the Philly area.
"The closest gyros I've had to the ones in Greece are from the King of Souvlaki truck, specifically the pork gyros (though their lamb and chicken ones are no slouches either). Primary location's the truck on the corner of 31st and 31st in Astoria but they've also got an additional truck in Bayside and I believe they're expanding to Midtown and Bayridge. Ironically their souvlaki's okay, Frankie's on the other end of Astoria's much better for that though.

I've yet to try BZ Grill but I've heard a lot about them as yet another contender for best gyro in the city.

And for me personally E Taverna's got the best handle on Greek seafood out of all the Astoria tavernas."
"“Being as the government is forcing us to pay our staff enough money so that they can afford to eat, we can’t afford to stay in business”

If your employer pays you so little that you need food stamps to survive, you’re not on welfare. Your employer is."
Truth. 
"""so the menu consists of a lot of meat....""

Say no more."
"Wage hike helped me. Not thriving, but enough to look onward in my schooling. Now if they increased the threshold for Medicaid where it's more accessible to people after this wage hike. "
I'll keep my 15 minute commute and gays for days. Astoria is nice tho! 
"Ask for the Patient advocate Change your room, if possible. (you may have tried already)

Call tv news stations. That usually fixes things quickly. Local representatives. Good luck. "
"Get a digital themometer with big numbers. Take a picture of the low temp with hospital stuff in background. Tweet/facebook to hospital, and send to local news."
I'm from NYC and it's disappointing.
