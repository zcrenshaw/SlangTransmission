"All of this is true, especially when moving out because honestly the landlord sounds like a piece of work. My first landlord when moving countries was like that. I had to hound him down to fix things around that mouldy flat. ""Yeah, yeah, cool, cool, I will."" (He never did.)

With bed bugs specifically, before moving into a new building I recommend putting everything you own in garbage bags to suffocate those fuckers, definitely heat treat your clothes (it's what I did) and if you can put them in the freezer too. The sprays don't help. Also, wrap your mattress in a special cover. Be extra careful when travelling (like, check the bed etc. before unpacking) even though those things can sneak a ride with you on public transport. "
This charge is from Christmas eve. It's not dropping off.
No way. 120k will not get the life op described. 
"Stop paying rent and wait for him to take you to court or fix the issue

Save the money to pay the back up rent when the issue is solve , take picture and video of everything  Incase you need proof in court 


Nothing will lit a fire on the landlord ass then not getting paid for an apartment "
"Fair points here. Everyone's situation is indeed different. I thought it could help me in my research to just get a general sense of what people thought. The job certainly wont give me a salary based on what reddit says, but it does help me at least ball park a figure that I would want in order to move.

Thanks for the reply as your suggestions would be a better way to approach. Have a good one."
"This store is heaven for planners and stationery! OP, go here."

"Kidding Around, there’s one in Union Square and I think there’s another location as well. "
LMAO it's such an easy answer and yet here we are
I’d add AMNH - it’s an instant mood-booster of a Museum. 
"Regardless of what the lease says or does not say, the landlord is responsible for eliminating the bugs.

See NYC DOH:

First step is to make the 311 complaint by filling out the form above.

Then talk to a lawyer who (a) is NYC-based (b) specializes in housing/landlord-tenant law."

Make the Road NY is a really amazing place. Mostly Spanish speaking students.

Think Geek is really fun. I went to buy a gift card for my brother the day before Xmas and walked out with 2 bags of stuff. Both me and my 8 year old had so much fun in there shopping.
Lego would make sense for such a global brand. Lord know they could afford rent from selling 5 death star sets!
"State News, which I just saw on google maps is actually now called Modern Stars sells a lot of toys. It’s also party supplies and stationery but they have toys too. "

"Just out of curiosity: 

1. Do you have a *bona fide* residence in the state of your license?  

2. Since June, 2013 have you ever renewed your driver license or sent any mail to your previous state's DMV with your previous address?

3. Are you a *named insured* on an automobile policy?  

4. If you own a car, where is it registered?

5. Where are you registered to vote?"
"YES Camp is AMAZING. It has a pretty basic storefront, but if you go into the ""secret"" room it's an insane fun space / store. It is very thoughtfully curated and supposedly they redo it every few months. So fun."
"Best bet is to call the local. If you have a hard time with that, talk to your local.

"In case you don't find a suitable in-person class you can take, I found MIT's 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms course, which is available online for free via [this Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&amp;list=PLxZdKEtmy3GRhETjatYq9v3O8VVt3YrNb&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) and accompanying [course site](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) extremely useful. I had also already started my professional career when I decided I needed to improve my algorithms and data structures knowledge, so don't let the fact that this is a college course dissuade you; it will give you both the depth and breadth of knowledge you're after."
"Lol, I'm a plumber, not an electrician. Thanks, though. I have a few friends in the field, also interested in NYC. I'll pass this along. Thanks! "
Couch surfing? Airbnb just a room? 
That happens to me all the time. Haven't figured out how to solve it.

"If you'll be here on a Friday evening, it's free on Friday evenings from 7 to 9 (and they also have a free jazz concert in the lobby).  It's a great way to see the museum."
Turning right back around 
"Agreed with everything this guy said, and also want to add that every lease I've signed in NYC has a separate page regarding bed bugs. It's usually something along the lines of ""Landlord has no knowledge of bed bugs in the building since ____ date"". I'd check to see if you signed something similar to that. You will be able to get out of your lease fairly easily if that doc has been signed by both you and the landlord.

Sorry you're in such a shitty situation, hopefully you can get out soon."
"I think the poster above you confused the question and thought that this was a thread for ideas of good replacements for the Toys R Us location, not current alternatives that exist, which is what I assumed this thread was about."

What’s been wrong with FD lately?
You’re under no obligation to tip.
just tip when u feel like it man it aint that hard
Tinder
Amazonfresh and prime now if you want Whole Foods 
Is this related to STORY?
Thank you!
Just checked — waitstaff still are making less than $15 pre-tip. So I guess that means continue tipping as usual. 
"It depends on what you want to do. Haha, what do you want to do? Specifically. "
There's such a thing as moral or ethical duty independent of whatever your legal obligations are.
"https://www.timeout.com/new-york-kids/things-to-do/karaoke-places-for-nyc-kids-1

It's usually a time issue - most places prohibit kids after a certain hour, but bringing them during the afternoon is fine."
"Learning the relevant software programs is a useful skill to have, but you can learn what you need with freelance classes. You do not need to spend another 50k on higher education. It boils down to this: do you have the ability to attract and cultivate a clientele that can afford your services? You won’t make it as a principal of a firm if you can’t mingle and relate with people that have money. Otherwise, you will be working for a firm. Most likely making next to nothing because you have a “glamorous position”. Your marketing skills will take you where you need to be...assuming you have an innate design sensibility.  "
Absolutely irrelevant. The responsibility still falls on the landlord. 
Have you checked the Flushing one on Main St?
"I use Peapod when the sales are better than my local grocery store. Not terrible, but they routinely miss one item which is replaced with a totally different random item (For example, they forgot to include tomatoes, but I got a random can of green beans). Delivery is almost always within the time frame you select (Never had them not show up, but have had them come a little early)."
"Everything moves quick. Most places will want you to move in within 2 weeks, if not sooner."
I guess we'll see how this plays out. 
Maybe you can stay at her boyfriend’s place since be’ll be staying at yours.
Aside from the train situation I think I like the sound of ev more
"cool, thanks"
"This is great to know, since safe to say we'd be doing most of our workouts in the SoHo location anyway (we both work off Prince). SUPER helpful, thanks!"
"All jokes aside this isn’t a good sign (I’ve read your other posts too). When someone tells you they aren’t attracted to you anymore due to confidence and masculinity issues, you’re kind of exacerbating those traits when you make it so apparent that you’re changing for her. Kind of a lose/lose situation."
"Yeah it's a pain in the ass, but that's the way it works. I miss living in Chicago where you could start looking 3 months out or so. Here the most I was able to manage was 1.5 months and that took a lot of negotiating. Our last place we ended up overlapping and paying one month of double rent in order to snag the perfect spot without losing it by waiting for our lease to end. "
"Neither Thailand, nor Malaysia, nor Vietnam are in South Asia."
Shit I got my FD coming in today between 8-10
"Second this. I have people bring their pay stubs, references and the whole she bang so that they can lock it down once they see something they like. Real estate (even rental) is a blood sport in nyc."
"Are these people renting their whole apartment by the night, like AirBnB, just on Craigslist?


It's illegal to rent out your apartment like that for less than 30 days, if a tenant isn't there. "

Thanks a lot!

These all sent my alarms ringing but I haven't looked for these sorts of things before so thought I'd get some external input.. I emailed two and called one. Emails were returned without greetings or names and just asking for my email to send details etc. The one I called seemed like it could be ok, but he declined to let me see the place as conveniently there was someone staying until the morning of the day I said I'd like to check in. But yea, they are definitely sketchy. Probably just going to find an airbnb for them. But do let me know what you think, I really appreciate it!"
"Yes, they also don't include names etc. I emailed a couple of them and got replies lacking greetings or signatures or anything. Just requesting for my address for them to email me details and I gave it to one of them and just got a brute request for check in dates. Seems fishy but I haven't looked for these sorts of things before so I thought I'd get a little external input. Thanks a lot though!"
"When i signed up my friend had been a member for a month, I used his referral and he got $150"

No problem! 
The Nintendo Store in Rockefeller Plaza is always a fun visit.
