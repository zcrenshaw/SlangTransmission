"I'd make the city build me a luxury brownstone as far away from the Park Slope YMCA as possible, and have a caravan of armored vehicles drive me for a workout multiple times a day."
Getting on an empty train car during rush hour.
Making a right turn on red
This is pretty much NYC 101.
"I was supposed to write one thing, but I guess I got carried away.

Annexation project:
- Our new city state will need a lot of infrastructure which our cousins in Jersey have. Compose a propaganda campaign and have Jersey city along with eastern jersey join us via a referendum. Create new boroughs and unite the NYC metro area into one cohesive political nation.

Multiple infrastructure projects:
- Aquire and expand NJ port.
- Extend the 1 train under the east river to reach governors island, redhook Brooklyn, and terminate at the 4th ave - 9th Street Station in Brooklyn.
- Build a new light rail line to connect all the outer boroughs. Start in St. George Staten Island and go underneath the harbor to Brooklyn. Then modernize old wwii tracks that connect Brooklyn and Queens giving train access to deep Brooklyn and Queens. Finally, connect with Bronx.
- Build new Manhattan Subway lines to replace unrepairable old subway infrastructure.
- Close La Guardia Airport and turn it into a park. Make JFK the new regional airport. Use annexed Newark and expand it to make it a large international airport.
- Create high speed double decker train connection between the new Newark airport, midtown and the new JFK.
- Create proper subway and rail connections for our new buroughs in NJ.
- Create real bicycle infrastructure. Hire Dutch police officers to enforce and teach proper bicycle handling ettiequte.
- Make sure that every New Yorker has less than a 10 min walk to nature. If not possible, purchase buildings and land to develop the parks, a la Robert Moses style (minus the displacement). Any displaced persons will be guaranteed equivalent housing plus compensation.

I got a lot more ideas but I won’t get anymore carried away."
I think some of these people are probably mentally ill?
We were stuck for 45 minutes but they had enough power to back us up in the reverse direction. Then we all had to walk to the front of the train to exit through one door that was halfway open
"No - if it's a good bar it's probably packed and loud when I want to sleep. If it's a bad bar, I don't trust their upkeep and expect to fine little friends crawling around my apartment at some point."
"Could be a scammer, might be a clueless tourist.

Protip to tourists: if you want something get to the point quickly. Around here a roundabout narrative leading up to a question flags you as a scammer."
"Make weed legal and throw all of that money on the trains and buses. Do whatever I can to modernize trains and buses. Medicinal psychedelics. Since most of the tax dollars won't be going upstate, I'd try to implement a system of free Healthcare (and mental Healthcare) and basic income. Decriminalize prostitution. Probably reclaim all of the apartments where ppl don't live in them most of the year and give them to people that will live in them. Claim the knicks for the city state and give it to an owner that isn't fucking Dolan."
Stopping for people who grab their attention off the street.
"Definitely a discount or an item on the house. You shouldn't have to ask, it's implicit."
"Stopping in the middle of the sidewalk or a subway staircase to check phone, often for directions. Step out of the way and to the side.

Walking through high-traffic areas because that's what Google Maps said to do.

Not knowing how to order at the deli.

Not learning a few words in Spanish.

Not checking how public transit is going to be fucked up over the weekend or on a holiday.

Staring.

Paying full price for shows that have rush tickets.

Not cleaning your face immediately at the end of the day. This may not seem like a New York thing but it's a very dirty city.

Being afraid of Black and brown people.

Wearing one pair of shoes all day instead of having commute shoes and destination shoes.

Being afraid of ask for help even though NYers are super helpful.

Not getting a regular bodega/bodega guy as soon as you have a new work/home neighborhood.

Over-reliance on Yelp reviews and appearance.

Not actually learning a little about the different cultures here and their holidays/observance."
"This is my in-laws when they visit. They whisper it like it’s a bad word, “Then the kids are taking us to ... Harlem.”  Uh— no were not Diane, for the last time we live in Washington Heights. I can’t afford Harlem."
"I’m just sick of being scammed out of my poop bags, nothing personal"
"I just discovered the [NYC ferries](https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/), which are only the price of a subway ticket at $2.75. Last weekend my fiancee and I got on at 34th street and took it down to DUMBO for brunch. It was awesome! Then we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan, went to a coffee shop down in FiDi, checked out the NYSE on Wall St. and Stone St., then we took the subway home. It was a great morning. There are endless things to do in this city you just need to get out there and find them.

Sources I use regularly are Reddit, [The Skint](https://theskint.com/), [Event Brite](https://www.eventbrite.com/), [Park Movies](https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/movies-under-the-stars), as well as many IG accounts.

Also, where do you go to med school?"
"I survived the 2003 one. Actually remembered it pretty well, was a junior HS student at the tine. Was playing Counter Strike at a friend's house. A/C was blasting, we were yelling at the computer monitor, having fun when everything shut off. It was around 4 something, I believe. Went outside and saw some of his neighbors walking out as well. I yelled over to see if they were having power issues but they did not respond, thought that was rude haha. Hopped on our bikes and rode around to realize that the blackout was far wider reaching. At that point, we figured it was most of Queens. This guy had the radio on in his car blasting 1010WINS and thats when we found out it was most of the Northeast so that was really surprising. I rode my bike home, mom was yelling at me for not getting home sooner cause of the blackout. I made a case for me to get a cell phone (didn't have one yet). As it got darker, a lot of people in my neighborhood begin to hang out on their stoops. It was August and freaking hot so being outside was better than inside at this point. That was kind of nice, just seeing everyone sort of relaxing and talking to each other. I also remember the night sky being gorgeous because the city was so pitch black. You could almost see the Milky Way. I brought out my telescope, pointed it at the moon. I immediately saw a satellite fly by, that was really awesome. No matter where I pointed the thing, it was just full of stars. We retreated inside, took very short showers using a flashlight and went to sleep. The power was back on in the morning and that's my NYC Blackout of 2003 story!"
"Great advice. 

A few weeks ago I was walking my dog around 23rd st &amp; forgot a poop bag. Saying “excuse me” to 2-3 people walking dogs didn’t get them to stop. When I said “do you have a poop bag” to a woman walking her dog instead she stopped right away &amp; gave me one."
Talking about going to Harlem like they’re taking their life in their hands.
Washington Square Park or any bar with outdoor seating in the west village
you shouldn't have asked for a discount. the manager's a fucking idiot if he didn't comp you anything.
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York 

Also a top contender for best Christmas movie"
Death penalty for unnecessary horn honking.
"It is 3 am so I just want to say that I misread the title of this thread as, ""Cockroach appears at restaurant: do you expect it to pay for the meal?"""
Not that I’m happy it happened but I’m sooo glad this happened on the weekend. Can you imagine the absolute fuckshow it would be if this happened at 9am Monday? I shudder to think...
"Huh. I always thought it was the classic, I'm in from Jersey and I swear I normally don't do this but my daughter is home sick and I really can't let my ex-wife know that I didn't have any poop bags. Please, I really just need $85 for poop bags."
Slow walking.
Well I guess that Statue of Liberty is getting a brand new me shaped face.
I’m currently rioting.
Stopping for people that offer CDs on the street
Nah it's busted AC season
Even at $100-125k combined income it's very hard.
I've learned to not shop there or be very annoying in asking prices.
"Subways, bus lanes, and bike lanes everywhere. If NIMBYs complain, they get an elevated train routed right through their living room."
"Coming to America, hands down."
"I’d be surprised if any barista course had a minimum height requirement. You might need a small step stool to reach a standard coffee shop bench, but I’m sure you can make it work."
"There are some Evangelist churches that require their parishioners to evangelize for some specified amount of time per week and/or to a minimum number of people per week.  This evangelism can be one on one conversations or walking around yelling at people.

The only reason I know about this is a friend's aunt joined one of these churches for a while.  That aunt was dis-invited from my friends family functions shortly thereafter.

Thankfully these churches are very much small and not very popular."
Yes. Go to penn station on a summer Friday and you’ll see.
"Well, thank God de Blasio is in Iowa — otherwise he’d have the cops out ticketing buildings for being dark."
I actually love this fictionalized NYC in which you're the dictator
"The subways were still working, but they skipped many stations because those stations didn't have power, and they ran at low speeds on the local track because signals were out in many locations."
Standing on the left side of the escalator instead of going up or staying on the right if they didnt want to move
"I can factually answer ""maybe."" A friend of mine works with luxury-tier home audio work, and his firm actually got a client in 432 Park that asked them to install something in the walls to help prevent the noise the building makes when it sways in the wind. IIRC it was a weird situation and the client didn't want the apartment or was looking to sell it again, but my friend's firm was working with people who did own an apartment in the building and wanted to make it livable."
"Don't go back there. Bartender was been unprofessional. They shouldn't demand tip. And a $1 is reasonable for just for opening a beer for you. It wasn't even a mixed drink.

Should've told the bartender as you gave him the $10 bill to keep the change. That would've let them know it was tip."
"Classic NYPD response 🙄. Fight the ticket, this is bullshit"
"Not purposefully standing by the door on the subway (like, knowing that your stop is the soonest stop that would have the left/right side doors open) and instead blocking other people’s way.

And in general, holy damn, move towards the middle in subways cars. There are *always* complicating factors that have to be accommodated like pregnant women, the elderly, workers carrying a lot of equipment, the homeless, students w instruments, etc etc etc that make moving in basically always a requirement."
"Worse, honking at me for walking in the crosswalk correctly while you are incorrectly trying to make a right turn on red"
"Have you been to Queens? Get on the 7 and get off in a different country every few stops. 
Have you been to flushing? Explore the Golden shopping mall food courts where amazing food is to be had for very little money.
Get on the N/W and come out to Astoria for incredible whole fish! We love AbuQuir on Steinway and Hamido on Ditmars. This isn’t even to mention the Greek food!
 Check out Robert Sietsema’s posts in Eater NY for really incredible places that don’t have a publicist. I have lived here for 8 years and I got very tired of the fancy restaurants very fast. My only splurge now is Omakase for special occasions."
im literally moving on saturday so my plan is to die outside
"This was a huge fuck up on his part because you played it cool, a good restaurant manager would know that you want to keep people that play it cool coming back. I would’ve at least asked for a shot of something strong to help suppress the memory, but I wouldn’t expect a free meal, though I’m surprised you didn’t get one."
"2003 one.  Was in the office. We were all terrified this was a second 9/11 but luckily someone had a radio so we we learned the black out and not terrorist attack.  A lot of people were thinking it though.

Walked up from Midtown to home in the UES. It was actually kinda awesome.  Everyone was super helpful.  That night all the streets, bars and restaurants were filled with people as they were giving things away like ice cream. 

It was like the nicest anarchy ever."
"Still here, living with the mole people now."
"I've always wanted to live above a bar.
After 5 years, I moved to my current place which is above a hookah bar.

Sadly, I hate the place. (Monkey's paw, huh?) But my roommates love it and apparently everyone in my neighbourhood.

I'm also on the 5th floor, and my window faces the street/their outdoor seating area.

It can get pretty loud, but I'm gotten used to it and find it vaguely comforting. Only when there are massive fights do I wake up. Which is around once every 4-5 weeks (in the summer)

In the winter it's dead af.

I am a relatively deep sleeper so it really depends on how much you can take. If you're waking up to car honks -- you definitely will not enjoy living over a bar."
"I've lived in NYC a long time - I just have developed a sense by the look in a persons eyes and body language if they're legit - which means most of the time I don't give these types of people the time of day. If they really need help they can go to the police.

And yeah, the 'need transit fare to get home' is one of the oldest scams out there - have seen it mentioned in NYC guide books from the late 1800's."
Hopefully they also investigate why the mayor was in Iowa with his thumb up his ass running a campaign he should have stopped weeks ago.
"Take pictures of it and you can call 311 to file a report over the phone.  It is illegal, and downright predatory.  A shame that this often takes place in lower income communities."
Thinking NYC is only Manhattan.
"I work as a handyman and install a lot of ACs. 

If the window you are putting AC into us facing the street you'll likely get a fine from the city if you don't install a bracket under the AC. It's something that they've started to enforce recently.

Good news is that you can get one of these nifty no-drilling brackets that install almost instantly! I love these things:

BLACK + DECKER BAB-2438 Window Air Conditioner Support Bracket, 7.1 x 25.8 x 16.7 inches, Grey https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IHNUYUM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_llEkDb7AB4XGS

If $90 new is too steep I have a used one from an old job I can sell you for $40. Send me a pm if you want it."
"It would be illegal for you to live in an apartment with no power, and Con Ed is not going to step into your domestic situation.  If you can't get your roommate to pay half of the bills and you can't figure it out, get out of the lease."
"Dog parks. People get so intense about their dogs, and all sort of “dog person” idiosyncrasies come out. (I say this with love, as a dog person myself). Plus there’s so much happiness to see."
"Honestly, someone tried stopping me in soho recently by asking ""can I ask you a question"" and I said I didn't have time while walking away. You sound more courteous than I am, there are enough people in NYC that if they really need something like directions they can try again on someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record, people who need things like directions don't need to beat around the bush, they typically need to find out which way they're going before running late."
"if the train car is empty because of a smelly hobo, then that's no ordinary hobo"
42 year anniversary to the day of one of the biggest nyc blackouts...what a coinky-dink
"&gt;prevent/mute the noise the building makes when it sways in the wind

This seems super unsettling to live with. I wonder if the sawy can be felt by the resident."
"Technically when that ""Just used"" thing happens, you're supposed to go to see someone in the  booth and they can tell from the metrocard that you didn't get a chance to go through - and they'll let you in. I know it's kind of a PITA when this happens and you're in a hurry. But - that's the way you're supposed to do it.   


I'm not saying you shouldn't try to fight it though. I am just not sure in this particular instance what will happen."
"That's ridiculous. 
This is literally a forum to trade information to help each other make more informed decisions in NYC. How would that not be necessary info?"
"1.Waiting for subway platforms in dead heat where it just feels like a muggy convection oven.

2. Hearing what other people in other cities pay for rent monthly. You die a little inside. ^(oh $400 for a two bedroom how lovely my small closet costs $1400 a month and I share a bed with roaches)"
"Honest question: have you really thought about WHY you want to buy? So many people talk about owning property being ""the American Dream"" or ""an investment"" or that ""rent is throwing your money away"" or that it's more adult to rent, or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't view rent as ""throwing away money,"" it's almost like the difference between spending money on vacation vs things. I'm spending money to be able to live in a place that I really like. I'm not responsible for maintenance or if things break down. Mortgage might not go up, but the price of all those things do.

&amp;#x200B;

I make over $100k, plus my husband's salary, but am not really looking to buy unless something amazing falls in our lap--like our apartment going co-op."
"They are definitely both mentally ill and uneducated. Mustache dude is straight rude with his yelling. 
But it’s just part of being human. All good! 
Watch Airplane the movie and then you’ll know what to do."
“Because fuck you.” — The MTA.
My friend and I were JUST talking about this yesterday. The performers/speakers are such a mish mash I don’t understand what this festival is about. From Deepak Chopra to John Legend to Dr Oz and Rachel Ray? What business do all these disparate people have sharing an outdoor stage in hot AF July? I’m so confused.
"Hey MOD, read the sidebar. You might notice that it's literally a list of restaurants ranked by review scores."
"Cheapest? Q70 to the M. You'll be sitting for a while on the M but it'll get you there. $2.75.

"This is a good short-hand note for NYC tourists: Don't ask ""can I ask you a question?""  Just ask ""Excuse me, which way is sixth avenue??"""
I just found [this](https://reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/6z5222/_/dmsqu46/?context=1) ... very helpful
$500 seems awful low especially considering you pay a $300 premium.
"3 times in the past 2 weeks: I've seen someone board the train while on a phone call, and try to continue the phone call as the train was leaving the station. And even when it inevitably disconnects, they keep trying to get the person's attention as if they've been put on mute or something.

Let's not even get started with how loud they were speaking."
"KIDS

Also, a bunch of movies being mentioned were set here but not filmed here."
"I mean, it’s a major subway stop and everyone in Hell’s Kitchen has to cross it to work in Midtown.  So, yes, locals travel through because it’s a transit hub.  We don’t stop or shop or anything like that there — but lots of us do have to go through.  When I liked in HK, I treated the commute like a game of tourist red rover — tried to weave in and out and get through in record time.  It was fun."

"If you can get off work I’d do it.

I haven’t stopped by a deli because my anxiety of not knowing how to order keeps me from trying

Find another doctor. I’ve never heard of this in my life.
What if I told those aren't new yorkers
Every time they film a Spiderman movie I look forward to which N.Y. settings they use. I'm bias tho because they use a lot of Queens 😎
