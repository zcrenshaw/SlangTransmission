"...I'm not going to answer this until you give way, way more information on what you want with that sheep."
I think of it as being anonymous opposed to insignificant. You matter! Just not to strangers 
Bike taxis in Central Park. Shit costs like $100 to get across the park...
"I assume you're all jointly on a single lease agreement, which is the standard practice. You should review the lease carefully, but it's likely that there's some language on there about how you're all jointly and severally liable for the rent. 

That means you're all on the hook for the roommate's debt and you're going to have to come up with the money to pay the landlord. If you don't, the landlord will eventually take all of you to housing court, which means you'll end up on the tenant blacklist. Do everything you can to avoid this. Take care of the payment to the landlord first.

You can sue your roommate in small claims for his share of the rent, but pay your landlord first, because the small claims case likely won't be resolved before your landlord takes you to court. You might be able to avoid going to small claims court by talking to your former roommate and explaining that you're prepared to sue him.

And find a new roommate ASAP.

The grand central oyster bar always has a old nyc feel to me. Not sure if others agree with me 
"Sleep no more/Gallow Green and events like that.

Posh bars - Library Bar, Zinc Bar, Dizzy's, The Ship.

Also keep in mind that The Met is definitely affordable. Check out Friday under 40s. 


Oh with winter coming out - Check out Michael Arnella's Dream Orchestra events and D√Æner en Blanc. Also keep in mind that a lot of our local opera companies host galas.

"I absolutely love the NY Public library - it‚Äôs a historical landmark and one of my favorite buildings. Love the stately staircases, the old books in the reading room, marble columns, etc. There‚Äôs also interesting exhibits (and clean bathrooms)! A win/win always. "
Shit that they can buy back home but choose to buy in Times Square. 
"I think most folks agree with your points.  Many people are concerned about the effects this will have on rent, and people being driven further out into Queens.   Most everybody is concerned about the effects this will have on the 7 train, which already seems to be running at capacity during rush hour, with repairs and upgrades that never seem to get finished.   I am concerned about the effect projected rent increases will have on commercial properties, as we will likely see businesses unable to renew their leases, and properties that stay vacant for an unseemly amount of time as owners hold out for large corporate renters who will pay the new rents the landlords think they can get.

&amp;#x200B;

Good time to own a home in Long Island City, Astoria, or Sunnyside, though."
"You may need a combination of flying to see them more frequently (spend as much time with them as you can; you might regret not doing so later) and, if they need care, help them get the care they need. You *could* move back, but you've got to live your own life. Don't move back and resent being there rather than here. That's my take as someone in a similar position. "
"Go to the nearest precinct ask them what you should do. Write down who you speak with, the day, time and their advice. Show them the photo of the perp."
"CUNY (City University of New York) is composed of a dozen+ schools that have deep cooperation (shared admissions systems, shared class registrations systems, easier than usual class credit transfer, shared facility use systems, etc.). It is not a school but rather an entity allowing multiple independent colleges and universities to cooperate and work together.

One of those schools is CCNY (City College of New York), which has a campus at 137 St and Amsterdam Ave in upper Manhattan. This is a regular college which functions within the CUNY system. It focuses on liberal arts but is also know for schools of Architecture, Education, Pre-Med support, and some CS. It's a regular (but IMHO very good) college.

In order to apply to CCNY a student would apply to CUNY noting they are applying to CCNY in particular. Applying to multiple CUNY schools is handled by a single application, so the same student applying to Queens College as well would not have to submit any additional applications, would just need to note their application is to consider the second school as well."
"Lonely, occasionally. Insignificant, never.  "
"The Beekman hotel lobby, near City Hall"
Anything at the M&amp;M store. 
I guess I should also mention that looks a lot like someone who was skulking through my garbage and loitering around my place. 
"Just making sure here but, I assume you know that 4 and 5 trains run on the track one level below the 6 trains, right? "
"Change my view: this whole thing is overhyped

5,000 employees is essentially 1 commercial building. Why does it matter if Amazon is the sole occupant versus any other developer? No one cared about Google moving into Chelsea. I expect a fair amount of new Amazon employees will stay in Manhattan anyway."
Dirty water dogs are fucking delicious. 
NYPD hats/tshirts. 
Only if you have two ore you‚Äôre willing to trade. 
"My wife and I love getting dressed up and going to performances at Lincoln Center, specifically the Met Opera and the NY Philharmonic. You can typically find tickets for under $50, and they both have rush programs for tickets under $30."
What kind of work? A butcher? A yarn maker? A Little Bo-Peep costumed professional? The specific needs might have us directing you somewhere different.
"Just a note to anyone dreading long wait times, download a Netflix show, a podcast or something you can do if you're dreading waiting in line.  I hate doing anything that takes out of my day, especially my personal time, but there's no reason you can't kill 2 bird with one stone if a long wait really is going to detract you from voting :)"
Go downstairs. 
"Maybe 2-3 minutes, 6:30am, Greenpoint. The only line was to fill in the ballot"
Dude...with a $6k/month housing budget you can live in any neighborhood you want in a very nice apartment. 3-4 months is not that long. I would do it in a second if I was you.
"Did you know that the Welsh invented the condom, originally made from sheep intestines?

Then the English improved the design by taking the intestines out of the sheep. "
The anonymity is one of my favorite things. You can only be so self-conscious around people who are going to forget you in five minutes (if they noticed you at all).
"I'm gonna go out on a wing and say that based on what the OP is describing, this is not a private investigator we're talking about. Sounds more like a deranged homeless person than a professional."

"Animal Care and Control of NYC. They are a kill shelter so adopt from them. It‚Äôs easier to adopt from them than other shelters in the city as the process is easier otherwise Humane Society, North Shore, Bideawee, ASPCA. "
National chain restaurants.
"I'm a woman, and if this had been me I would have looked up if there were any nearby police stations I could walk into. If he followed me there, obviously I'd point him out to the police.

I don't think you overreacted. It's pretty clear from your story you weren't imagining it and he was actually following you. That's fucking weird.

Either he's a pussy who has no intention of harming you and was just doing this to feel power, or it's a crazy who would stab you if given the chance. Either way it's worth reporting to the police if it happens again, especially to generate a paper trail. Take a picture of whoever has been loitering around your place and see if it's the same guy"
"Moving to NYC without a job lined up or an apartment is a real dangerous move. While there are jobs to be had in the city, you can't just walk in and walk out with a job. Also, no matter where you go in the city, housing is absurdly priced. Do you have a monthly budget?"
Nope. Did not know that. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"As Sunnyside native, this makes me sad."
There's McSorleys. Not sure if it's all that grand. They haven't changed their menu in 200 years. 
Brighton Beach must be filled with folks who fit the bill.
"It is overhyped in that NYC is already a has a ton of tech and business administration jobs, and none of those people employed in those roles are having trouble finding employment in those fields for the past few years.

People act as though ""new jobs"" means that Joe Smoe who lives in the neighborhood and is unemployed is suddenly going to get a well paying job at Amazon, but the truth of the matter is that the city unemployment rate is already low, Joe Smoe probably isn't qualified for the Amazon job, and Amazon isn't interested in training anyone for any of the jobs they're hiring for.

If you already work in technology, Amazon becoming an employer in the city isn't really much of a game changer. If anything, Amazon's entry will probably contribute to a modest increase to the market rate for developers but not much else."
"Any food from Sbarros, especially in Times  Square. Best pizza is in NYC, yet they go there."
"&gt;we make around $350k

Oh fuck off. 

Guess what? Yeah, plenty of people don't buy homes in NYC for the reason you stated. 

So very sorry that you only have under $20k a month to spend after rent and child care. "
"To add to this, there is a program called [Club Free Time](https://www.clubfreetime.com/new-york-city-nyc/free-events-things-to-do/today/activities), which is a seat filling service that offers ""free"" tickets to various events for a convince charge of $4.50.

There are a lot of things on there that you could dress up for.  A lot of stuff at Carnegie Hall. 

The program costs $20 per year.  

"
"City College also houses the engineering school

CCNY I think may be like the old ""crown jewel"" kinda part of the system - it was historically known as the harvard of the poor back when harvard had quotas on ethnic whites"
"Further congesting the mass transit, driving up rent forcing lower income families out of the neighborhood, changing the skyline (beautiful in Sunnyside btw). Overall a very negative post. Care to point out some positives?"
"90 minutes.  One of two scanners were down.

To be honest, though the election volunteers were nice, the whole thing was a shitshow."
"I was going to say chain restaurants they can get at their local mall, but this encompasses that and then some."
"Even if every single new employee is a transplant, and every single one settles in Queens, that's a population increase of 0.05%.

It's their HQ, with highly paid positions needing lots of experience and qualifications, many of the new staff likely already live here.

If you wanted to live in a city that never changes, you really picked the wrong one.

UPDATE: I've read that the 25,000 figure will only be reached about a decade down the line. It's more like 700 by the end of 2019."

"Security experts say to always trust your gut. Sorry it happened to you. I hope it was a one off.

Pepper spray is great. Camera out and on (video) if you think he's around. Document everything. But really hope you never see him again. "
"The Cloisters is also stunning (13th century architecture!), and St Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral is also absolutely wonderful. Old stained glass, and a sense of history.  "
If you‚Äôre struggling to live in Long Island City with 350K in combined salary you desperately need to learn how to manage your finances.
Small claims court is a thing. 
"Sue your roommate. 

"
"Just fly back as often as you can. My parents live 20 hours of flying away from me, and yeah it sucks. I fly back at least once a year, but due to new job and difficulty getting PTO, I haven't seen my Dad in nearly 2 years - but flying back in 2 weeks to see him! Can't wait, but honestly it's not easy at all, I feel your pain. 

With your parents living in the midwest, you could just do cheap quick flights over there on long weekends - I wish I had that option!"
