People earning 6 or 7 figures taking public transit.
Try making six figures and still being broke.
"Daydreaming, mostly. I like NYC, even though I've lived and probably will die here in Brazil. It's cool to know what locals think about such a great city beyond the glamorous view that's always shown on tv and movies."
"Not having a valid driver's license is probably *more* normal in NYC than in other cities.

Spending a majority of your income on an apartment that doesn't have central air, a washer/dryer (at the very least, a laundry room in the building), or a parking lot.

Having a corner store on *every* corner.

Not having a delivery fee when ordering on Seamless (although this seems like it's becoming increasingly popular here as well)."
Walking more than 50 feet
"It wouldn’t be much different than the morning commute, honestly. "
The smells. From radioactive looking stank water puddles on the curb in Chinatown to hobo taking a whole section on the subway or bus. I saw a guy picking out scabs (?) from his body and throwing them around.
"I’d stay.  And I have a plan

1. Go below ground
2. Horde canned food (it will be the new currency)
3. Fashion intimidating melee weapons
4. Form a bunch of orphans into a gang that accepts my leadership
5. Emerge with aforementioned gang to take over the wasteland
6. Finally fix the subway now that the MTA is dust."
"Ethnic diversity instead of racial diversity. 

I've noticed in a lot of cities and suburbs there is mostly just racial diversity, where there are three major groups, blacks, whites, and hispanics (which tend to be mostly mexican). 

In NYC, within those racial groups, there is so much diversity its almost hard to comprehend. In Brooklyn nearly half the black population is west indian or african instead of migrants from the south. We also have a huge puerto rican, dominican, and salvadoran population instead of mostly just mexicans. Among white people there's italian, russian, jewish etc neighborhoods. 

That kind of diversity is kind of very different from the racially based diversity in other cities. "
I speedwalk everywhere. 
"People who act like that are incredibly insecure, mentally unstable, or both. Has nothing to do with you as an individual most of the time, and everything to do with them projecting their problems onto random people. You either get used to it or move - and that isn't to sound like a jerk, but stuff like that is a small price to pay for big city life. "
Los tacos #1 
"Hey, Reddit, we're taking this guy out to the bar!"
"I don't think it brings income per say but it would *bring attention to your storefront*: 

[No Longer Empty](https://www.nolongerempty.org/) gives up and coming artists a place to exhibit their work as boost their careers. (And I think tax deductible for the value of the space!)


"
"Saw someone with a chipotle bag, they pulled a glass plate and metal silverware from their backpack, put the burrito on the plate and ate it with a knife and fork.  There was spillage"
"Still living with roommates

* when you are 30+
* when you make $100K+
* when you are daring/married
"
People not picking up their dog crap. It is truly an epidemic in some neighborhoods. Nasty. 
"I was a lot more trusting, and now I’m more cynical. Before it was a pleasant surprise when people were nice to me. Now I take a step back and wonder what’s on their agenda. 

On the bright side, I’m a lot tougher and more straight forward when it comes to communicating what I want and need."
Asking people what their rent is in casual conversation.
"Saying, “lemme get....” to order.           
 Not having a W/D or dishwasher.     
Buying groceries/fruit etc every other day.         
Nonstop flights.           "
The street crossing strategy of walking out into the street first then watching the traffic rather than the light to decide when to cross. Watching the traffic sometimes further considered optional.
"I mean, what do you want to do? If you’re going to just walk around and explore, only free activities, eat cheap meals, no drinks, and take the subway/bus everywhere....sure, you can make that work. 

If you want to see lots of sights, museums, eat a meal that costs more than $5, go out for New Year’s Eve, etc — then no, it’s not enough. "
"Deli/convenience store(bodega) male workers calling male customers ""boss."""
Prospective tenants being responsible for broker fees.

"Abhorrent train behavior like people cutting their toenails or people eating food and just throwing wrappers and shells and peels onto the floor. Also, the smell of Chinatown in the heat."
"Might not be any consolation but it sounds like you got incredibly unlucky. As was previously said these are two safe and well-trafficked areas and I’m surprised/disappointed anyone had the nerve to go this far with you. 

Please don’t let these jerks discourage you from coming back! And if you do come back and someone tries something like this on you, please call them out on it and loudly. Anyone within earshot of an “I said stop following me” or “get the fuck away from me” or “if you touch me again I’m calling 911” or “back off, perv” WILL come to your defense. 

Edit to add: anecdotally, some types of appearances probably get more shit from strangers on the street - but nothing you can do about the color of your skin/hair/your age. Women who seem timid also get shit, and this is something you CAN adjust (if it was an issue first time around). Walk like you belong, keep your head up and out of your phone, and make eye contact and nod with anyone you want to but save the smiling for people you already know you like. "
"7am, I had just taken a redeye into JFK, was on the E train coming into Manhattan and a guy boarded (one or two stops after Jamaica) with a steaming hot, super delicious pastrami sandwich, which he unfurled from a HUGE piece of foil, assumed the position, and started going to town on it. It filled the car with its heady, smoky, spicy aroma and to have that, instead of the odoriferous trifecta of rodenticide, electrical arcing, and poop, was the best welcome back to the city I've ever had."
I now dislike bagels from any place other than NYC
"As a non-NYCer who lurks this sub, I can assure you that this happens everywhere. "
"He’s not that unpopular. But “eh, he’s fine” doesn’t exactly sell newspapers. "
"The humidity this summer. Lived here my whole life and it's never been so consistently humid like this.  It's awful.  I walked to work today, it was 75 degrees.  Nice temperature right? Should be very pleasant.  I've literally already blown through my deodorant, sweat through my boxers and shirt and am just starting to cool down after being in the frigid AC at work for like 30 minutes."
"I mean there are so many things. We shouldn't have to walk around subjected to the smell of urine and excrement. There shouldn't be trash everywhere. I understand we don't have alleyways like some cities, but it's 2018 and these are solvable problems."
You're doing something wrong. But making six figures and not having a dream of owning a ~~house~~ home ever? Sure.
Fuck that
"I mean that would be a dream for some people. MORE importantly. Are you gonna be cool with a stranger moving in and using all of your nice stuff? That’s a real special kind of trust that I would most likely never give to a stranger. 

But there are a million people who would be down for that. "
Love that you're inquiring about this at 4 almost 5am 
"My impression after over a decade of dealing with it is that men like this expect a passive response from women, so the best thing is to *aggressively* ignore them.  The best I've come up with is:

1) Resting bitch face.  Ignore them completely and cultivate a scowl as you read or stare at your phone or otherwise divert your gaze from them.  Even the hint of anger is enough to get some of them to choose another victim.

2) If that doesn't work, close your eyes, and when you reopen your eyes have them aggressively trained on the starer.  Like destroy his soul with the anger of your gaze for maybe 2.5 seconds and then go back to what you're doing.  Just being caught is enough to shake some of these dudes.

3) If you have any feeling that this person might try to follow you or approach you in a way you feel is dangerous, find a trustworthy looking person in your proximity and ask if you can walk/sit with them until the creep moves on. 

**PSA for men:** When you observe this behavior (and I know you do), it is really, really helpful if you can move your body between the starer and his target.  If a women is being confronted or followed, anything you can do to distract a dude or slow him down can be the difference between a creepy situation and a dangerous one."
"By far the biggest is walking. I've had tons of people from out of town be shocked when I say we are gonna walk 15-20 blocks somewhere. They can barely even comprehend why anybody would walk that far unless they absolutely had to. 

Similarly, when I go to suburbia, people drive absolutely everywhere. Partially for necessity but also kind of cultural. They view walking at all as kind of a drag or boring. I think part of it is that the streets are sort of just empty for the most part, they're just endless suburban housing, so it is less interesting to walk places. "
"&gt; People who squat with their laptops for hours in coffeeshops with very limited seating, leaving the patrons who want to briefly sit to have their coffee with no spot, why?

To be a bit blunt about it, because I also wanted to sit and have my coffee... and I got there first. Also, I buy coffee/pastries throughout my stay (with tip). But ""very limited seating"" is a bit subjective, as I wouldn't do this at a place with 1-3 seats, but certainly enjoy my time at a 5-10 seater.

&gt; Also the people who give you dirty looks when you dare to have a conversation in a coffeeshop because they're on a conference call and/or working.

Noooope, those people suck. Conference calls aren't for coffee shops, and should you have to hop on the phone for more than 15 seconds, the respectful thing to do is to say you'll call them right back and step outside. As for being annoyed by other people's conversations, it's a public space, and both ""sides"" of this need to keep conversations to a reasonable volume, dictated by the venue (some coffee shops are for quiet reflection, some are much more boisterous). The default in a public place is that people will have reasonable-volume conversations, and those who don't wish to hear them should prepare with earplugs or headphones."

"Ive lived in NYC my whole life and this is an incredibly humid summer.  

It does often get humid, but then a good summer storm will break the humidity and you'll have a perfectly warm few days.  But our storms haven't been breaking anything have they?

Ive heard multiple cities in the US are having unusually hot summers; I dont think we are the only ones.   "
"Standing on the train, the scent of what I assumed was buttered popcorn wafted up to me.  I look down and see the woman sitting below me enjoying a hot, buttery corn on the cob.  This was on the morning commute."
They're random people that know nothing about you that you're never going to see again. Maybe you're at an even better place in life than they are. You probably are. Doesn't matter.

"&gt; When you observe this behavior (and I know you do), it is really, really helpful if you can move your body between the starer and his target. If a women is being confronted or followed, anything you can do to distract a dude or slow him down can be the difference between a creepy situation and a dangerous one.

Some tips for my fellow dudes that I've used before when I notice ""weird walkers"" (Guys who seem like they're walking a little too much in lock step with the woman in front of them) without getting confrontational:

- If far away from you, call after him and say ""Hey, man, I think you dropped something, pointing to something farther back along his path.

- Run up to him and immediately blurt out ""GARY?!"" then reveal that he looks just like your friend Gary, making sure to stop dead in your tracks. Remark how freakily close he is to Gary. Waste his time with idle chit chat about Gary, and ask if you can take his picture to show your friends.

- Stop him to ask him for directions.

I'm a smaller guy so I sort of have to go for the confusion factor rather than the aggression factor, but if you're a bigger guy, you make your own path.

Everyone in this city should really look out for each other. I don't care what race, gender, sex, or religion you are. We all make this the best city on earth by refusing to accept bullshit."
A woman cracking the shell of her hard-boiled eggs on the railing before eating them. Yuck. 
"This. Two years before I moved to NYC, I was subscribed. It helped me a get a sense of the city and really did prepare me for moving here. I was able to hear the good and the bad which helped set realistic expectations of what it would be like once I moved here. "
"Don’t engage - it might work on polite people who don’t mean to be rude, but the crazies will escalate if you engage. Headphones and sunglasses. Ignore and move. "
If you make six figures and you’re broke you are fucking up so hard in life. Not to say that six figures here is the same as elsewhere.
"The layer of inexplicable black filth that collects on anything flat that hasn’t been cleaned in a while, like windowsills and probably my lungs."
"You can’t imagine? Median household income is 50k in NYC. Literally most of the city raises kids on way less. Six figures is very fortunate, no matter how you look at it. "
"Nothing about your situation is unique - it's part of growing up, so that should give you some solace that pretty much everyone has felt this way.

&gt; I work alone, live alone, travel alone, eat alone... pretty much do everything alone.

You will have a social life when you invest in being social, so it shouldn't be a surprise that your friendship pool has dwindled. Also, even if you are actively seeking out friendships, there's nothing wrong with being alone. However, if you're feeling lonely (those two are not one and the same), there are solutions to your problems:


* **lonely in general:** attend therapy to figure out where this emotional hole originates from; volunteer to expose yourself to different people; attend any class (gym, hobby, etc.) regularly and talk to the other regulars.
* **lonely at work:** go to a communal work space; attend industry events, meetups, and happy hours.
* **lonely at home:** adopt a pet; live with roommates.
* **lonely when you travel:** sign up for a tour group specifically for solo travelers; when you do travel alone, make an effort to talk to people. Eat at the bar and ask the bartender where their favorite restaurant is.
* **lonely when eating:** join dining meetups; sign up for food tours; sit at the bar and talk to people.

&gt; I'm 28 and should be in my peak years, but I have nobody else to turn to or can hang out with.

Your peak years are not age dependent. Some people are at their peak at 30, some people refuse to have one single ""peak"" during a century of living and continue to learn, experiment, challenge themselves, and have dozens of ""peaks."" 

Learn to enjoy your own company, invest in your interests, and engage with others consistently - these are the key to making friends as an adult. "
The other New York subs aren’t as friendly when it comes to asking questions that tourists might be interested in. The whole nature of this sub encourages asking questions which I could see would make it attractive to anyone seeking info on the city. Locals or not

Also when you walk in to order they just stare at you with a blank face waiting for you to say something rather than greeting you and welcoming you to their store like a decent person
"I would give it a time buffer. In a crowded laundromat, 5 minutes seems plenty. Definitely don't stand there and empty it out as soon as it hits zero - maybe they set a timer and are on their way back. "
"Normal-looking Business-attired folks with shoes off clipping their toenails. It grosses me out more than anything because otherwise these people seem so normal. Also, nail clippers should never have a key ring on them because they shouldn’t need to leave your home. "
I’m thinking Dorsia.
"I'm a lawyer and I deal with leases (negotiating and drafting) all the time.  First, stores don't rent themselves.  You'll need a broker.  Maybe someone who specializes in pop ups would also be good depending on your site and preferences.

Finally, don't sign a lease without legal advice.  You can buy yourself a lot of trouble by doing so.

Retail is very challenging at the moment.  Good luck."
"Told to me by old girlfriend.

Pick your nose and if the booger is good, smear it some place."
"He's personally annoying, but has executed on good policies (Vision Zero has reduced traffic fatalities a lot, good property policies slowed the rise of rent significantly, Pre-K for all has helped a *lot* of parents, stop and frisk has been hugely curtailed, his paid/mandatory sick leave rules are a huge improvement) and he hasn't fucked anything up (Crime continues to plummet, graduation rates going up, economic boom has continued). "
"wait 10 mins, I always go back home with a timer for me to get there just as it ends, but sometimes shit happens and I'm a little late. "
"I moved from the city to North Carolina recently, and everyone here is too polite. Reading this sub is a healthy dose of sarcasm and sass, and it reminds me of home."
A more accurate answer would be that I cant walk slow even if I tried 
I'd be trampled in the ensuing chaos.
