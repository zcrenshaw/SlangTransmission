SOMEONE HELP THIS MAN IMMEDIATELY
"Absolutely not. This is a total, longstanding scam. They tend to target people who look like soft targets (usually women, or obvious tourists.) Ignore them as you would anyone asking you for money."
The biggest thing on Citizen at the moment is that a Citibike was stolen. They’re really cracking down on that shit I guess...
In a stabilized apartment
My condolences.
The library
Never trust a fart.
"This sounds urgent. You shit yourself, didn’t you"
"Every once in a while I step on one and I can feel it drop down a lot farther than I’m comfortable with, so I completely understand your concern. 

While it’s a rational thing to worry about, I don’t think it happens often. I guess try to avoid stepping on them if you can, but if you can’t, try to take comfort in the fact that falling through I s not a regular occurrence."
"Yeah. The basketball team story is the biggest scam in the book. 

It’s gotten so cliché that kids doing this on the subway will say, “I’m not trying to raise money for a basketball team, I’m just trying to make an honest living” (despite being in violation of [1050.6(b)](http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm#use))."
"Everyone says their CBD now, but for years they weren't even CBD, just ""Marijuana flavored"""
"[It happens](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-dies-fall-cellar-grate-article-1.2083339), but given how many times people must walk over them every day, I'm surprised it seems to only be a once-a-decade thing."
Somewhere around Hudson heights. There's a street (maybe 38) that has a few horse stables left. You can tell you're there because of the smell.
"People did it in Boston when I lived there - it’s just a thing people do with unwanted shit sometimes. I got some good cookware off a stoop in Williamsburg recently. Sometimes people put things out and drop a post on Craigslist titled “curb alert” to let people know where there is free stuff for the taking.

FYI - Plenty of people caution against taking anything, books even more so than cookware (and anything fabric definitely), because of the chance of bedbugs in ANYTHING you find. I usually judge the stack of books content to see if I’m concerned about the previous owner’s integrity/bedbug risk before I take anything (but this is dumb and not foolproof)."
Probably commuter copters picking up high level execs and taking them to the Hamptons for Easter weekend.
Niko tried to cross the bridge into Algonquin before he’d unlocked it yet.
Citizen used to be called Vigilante and has long had a race problem (and sort of didn't swiftly distance themselves from it for a while) . Anyways they are venture cap backed and will probably tone it down as things progress.
$500 weekend plus travel expenses.
"Yeah, getting mad is just part of their scam.

I told this kid to fuck off, so he followed me around for the next 5 minutes. Like, he’s 4 feet tall, I am not intimidated, and I’m obviously not giving him money. None of the other people who are watching are going to give money either, now. Pretty bad strategy."
"Yes. Had a tiny room in Bushwick for $450/mo.

Moved to Alphabet City to a larger, but still small, room for $1400/mo. 

I was basically living a baller lifestyle with my $450/mo payment. $1000/mo fun money was great. 

Now pay $2K/mo but make more money so it's alright."
"There will be other people waiting for the bus, so I would just Uber to there and you'll be fine.

Drop off is at 27th and 7th, I'd definitely feel safe around there."
"I left a couple books and two dead plants on my ""stoop"" one time and walked inside to grab more stuff. When I came back out, they were all gone. It was 530 AM. 

It's an effective system."
"The actual station always has people there (food carts and megabus passengers) so if you’re at the station you’ll be fine. It’s a little out of the way though and the walk to it is surrounded by big warehouse buildings and Hudson Yards construction sites. I probably wouldn’t walk there at 4am by myself. Either take the 7 (the new stop is right there) if you’re comfortable with the subway at 4am, or get an Uber."
"The Citizen app is pretty useful (I hate their slogan “protect the world”).

Every time I open the chat, it’s always filled with racism, etc. Every single time. I’m not sure how to fix it (I’ve reported the truly awful comments before and they’ve gotten removed but the same person came back with a different username.)."
"I ignored him but he started flipping out on me. Maybe he assumed I was a tourist because it was pretty packed today.

But that's good to know, I usually have a soft spot so I buy the candy that this same group sells on the train if I have cash. I'm no longer doing that."
"All the interesting shops have been replaced with chains.  It's difficult for an independent to afford the rents here now.

That's my big gripe, anyway."
Ignore those kids. They're basically pimped out to con people (just like the kids selling candy bars and fruit snacks on the MTA).
"I was a rave kid!  I used to go to NASA.  A lot of DJ Frankie Bones at other locations.  We would hear him at this warehouse by the now defunct Caesar's Bay Bazaar.  We would collect passes handed out at the raves and at cool boutiques and record shops in the city to know where to go next.  Sometimes the raves would even in Long Island, sometimes at the Shelter in Manhattan, sometimes at a community garden in Alphabet City.  Sometimes we would go and a about an hour into it the FDNY would shut us down - from that grew the popularity of wearing FDNY sweatshirts.  The fashion was super fun, but it kinda ended when everyone started to wear Adidas track suits (I guess they are comfy?).  Most of us were 16-20 - too young to officially go to real nightclubs in NYC.  Feel free to PM me, although my memories from those days are a bit hazy..."

Might be this firearm report. NYPD takes that seriously south of 96th."
"No.

One time, my partner and I stopped two asking for donations for uniforms for their basketball team on the train. There was a recent robbery pattern, and they matched the MO. They were saying they needed money for uniforms, how they're going to college in Buffalo, yada yada.

Long story short, these soon to be college attendees were actually 33 and 27, with a big case of baby face syndrome. I called the program they were representing, and she was dumb founded. She said they don't even use uniforms. 

Long story short, these programs don't ask their kids to panhandle for money. That's the whole point of these programs."
"You gambled on a fart, didn't ya"
And now police boats!
"Riverside Park, Battery Park. Also love Brooklyn Bridge Park and Greenwood cemetery in Brooklyn"
Step on the edges and you will be fine. Don't step directly in the middle.
OP to clarify this - it's not a station. It's just an area on the road dedicated to Megabus pick up. There is no physical building.
there's a guy on my block who has been trying to get back to long island for ten years
"I can respect the kids selling candy bars and fruit snacks on the train a lot more than lying to my face about basketball uniforms. Just wish some of them weren't so young, didn't flaunt their money or go between train cars. Many of them look like they're 12 years old."
Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters are superb if you’re really going for that “not even in NYC anymore” feeling
"The Flame Diner on W. 58th and 9th

Tick Tock Diner on 8th Avenue and 34th

"I've lived in New York for the past 6 years, earning in your range or lower, and have been able to save about 25% of my income a year.  It's not totally clear what you're asking, but these are some things I do that some people might find would make their experience less enjoyable.  But also obviously I didn't really have to do this either.

* I live with roommates, currently in a three bedroom but previously in a five bedroom, on average paying $1000 a month.  I have always lived in the trendy area Crown Heights (except for my first year of grad school when I was in subsidized housing).

* I mostly eat food I get from the grocery store, and do my shopping at Target/Trader Joe's (the latter of which has really long lines depending on the store).  I used to be more into comparison shopping, now I'm more relaxed, but I do things like, buy Greek yogurt at Target because it's 5 cents cheaper per box, though I suspect this doesn't really have an impact on finances.  I eat out on average of 3-4 times a week, half the times at places that are $10-15 per meal not including drinks, and the other half that are at places that are $20-30.

* The events I go to are cheap or free.  I rarely go to Broadway shows or fancy clubs, but I'm fine with going to places with a $10 cover, and very very happy to go to my friend's places for their house parties, or just to hang out.

* I used to have a fear of travel that wasn't like, riding a bus to Boston, because I was afraid of spending too much money.  I'm better about it now, but I just generally don't do a ton of travel compared to my friends.

* I buy my clothes from H&amp;M, Forever 21, and Asos, and I'm cheap with electronics - both my laptop and my phone were $300."
"My friend's dad calls your situation being a ""V of MC"", ""victim of misplaced confidence"".

Godspeed."
I just wanna know what happened in your life that led you to a point where you're citing MTA rules of conduct..
"The Honey Well in Manhattan is a chill, dimly lit cocktail bar, and Sundays are date night (x% off your bill if you show them your tinder match or something)."
"West side, 37-45th have several stables left.  between like 10th- 12th aves"
"I haven't seen any of those street games in years, stoop ball, stick ball, fast pitching, kings, off the wall, boxball, koko leavio, buck-buck...."
"Maybe check out the New York Hall of Science in Queens? My family loved that place when we were little, and it's right next to the World's Fair ground, which has a lot of very interesting structures (and a really nice park)!"
"The mailbox things are often part of the [“Little Free Library”](https://littlefreelibrary.org/) movement.  See the link for a map of them, building plans to make your own, etc."
Now I'm picturing [Bane escaping the stock exchange on a stolen Citi bike](https://youtu.be/BAjEW2zgs_o?t=3m41s)
I imagine this fear has increased exponentially after the Netflix show 'Russian Doll' was released - it's a major plot point.
Username sounds like a woman. A non-judgmental and supportive woman of action
