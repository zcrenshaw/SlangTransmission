"There's a metal circle on the wall outside the IFC Theater near West 4th. If you lift it up, it's got two little eyeholes and you can watch the movie that's playing."
"From her standpoint there is absolutely no difference between the other guy and you when it comes to having to deal with a stranger offering her a ride. It would have been creepy. Especially after that incident.

She has more experience dealing with this, so she quite possibly didn't find it as scary as you did. You did a good thing by sticking around until she got on a bus. That's pretty much the extent of what you could have done."
6 1/2 Avenue is pretty unusual and I don't think most New Yorkers know about it. It runs from 57th to 51st between 6th and 7th ave. and is the only street with a fractional number. It's pretty weird walking a public street through private buildings.
I think you're reading too much into what people might think about your address.
"Q train passing Dekalb into Manhattan. If you look to the right outside the window, with respect to the direction you are heading, you’ll see a flip book of art. I’m sure most people know this already. :)"

More inter-borough service without going through Manhattan. But it’s never going to happen
"I have two within 100 feet of my apartment - one is small, kind of run down, and packed full of all sorts of items.   The other is super nice and stylish - this is the one where the guy seems to hate everyone and makes up prices as he goes.

My guy at the not so nice place has the best prices around, is an absolutely delightful Dominican immigrant, and is happy to order items for me that he doesn’t normally carry.

Moral of the story - YMMV but when you find a great one be sure to give them your business."
"You can walk from the 49 street N,R, W station all the way to Rockefeller center underground and avoid ALL the crowds. It's an underground city down there. It reminds me of the underground portions of the movie ""Us"" where the tethered live"

"If by ""Trashcans on every corner"" you mean fix the MTA, I agree with you."
"Per a federal court ruling in March of this year, stun guns are legal in New York. The ban was ruled unconstitutional. I'd recommend The Runt. 20,000,000 volts and 4.5amps."

"The Hess triangle.

"This is a massive question. Broadly, violent crime across the country had continued to plummet since its peaks in the 80s and 90s. There are a lot of different theories of why... but none of them fully explain the dramatic shift. 

It’s most likely a combination of a lot of factors. Increased investment in low income communities, better employment opportunities for more folk (more can be done on both of these but it’s better than it was), removing lead from our environment, somewhat smarter policing, community anti crime prevention... shit I read an article the other day about how widespread use of cell phones was part of the crime reduction. 

Lots of reasons. We are also kind of seeing what didn’t work. Stop and frisk/broken windows policing has been discredited since its been seriously reduced and yet crime continues to fall."
"Yes. A couple weeks ago I went to one I had never been. A ordered a sandwich and got two drinks. 

Dude rang me up and didn't say how much, just asked if I was paying with credit. I asked him how much it was and he mumbled $15. Complete b.s. The sandwich was $5, the Arizona tea was $1, and the other drink was ~$2. 

He claimed ""oh, I must've typed it in wrong "" but I know he was lying. It ended up being around $8."
"Call the police next time. Don't start static - just call and be super clear with the dispatcher about what's happening. If the guys start yapping, snap a video or picture (or have a friend do it). 

Do not brandish a weapon if you don't intend to use it and kill/cripple/incapacitate them. I'm a grown man who knows how to fight (7 years of BJJ and boxing) and I wouldn't even try to do that with more than 2 guys. If you pull something, start talking tough and don't use it, you're screwed. 

Please stay safe. I'm sorry you're going through this."
"-take a colder shower than normal. Taking a warm shower increases your body temp in the morning. Also pat dry instead of rub dry as that also increases temperature.

-leave 15 min earlier so you’re not rushing and increasing your temp running to the train

-get a hat that absorbs and wicks sweat. I sweat mostly from my head and this helps a lot

-bring an extra under shirt to change into when you get to work"

"You could lay on the horn.  His Nissan is blocking traffic, after all.  Making it so nobody can hear him talk is just a nice side effect."
There’s a Speakeasy above the Five Guys on Bleecker street. Gotta walk into the Five Guys and go up the stairs
This guy sweats
Did you read that truly incredible article about how the only two demographics represented at that McDonald’s are people fresh from the methodone clinic and wholesome tourist families with kids who think that’s just how the city is? I think about it all the time
"Switched out the shower head that came with the apartment and replaced it with a much nicer shower head. The old one was sputtering about, sprayed towards the wall, and had pressure issues, but as soon as we switched it to the new shower head, it's been a dream."
Criminals couldn't afford to live here anymore.
"please...do not stop...at the entrance to the stairs of a subway station....in a big group...please i am begging u 

This is a huge problem especially at crowded subway station entrances. Canal street is always a nightmare."
"When these things have happened to me, the best things another dude could have done were all things directed at the cat caller. The last thing I wanted is more attention on me. You can pull your car up next to him and block him; you can tell at him to fuck off; you can just hang back and make sure nothing physical happens (like you did and probably the best choice). But I definitely didn’t want another guy to approach me - even with good intentions it’s hard to tell."
Extend the subways deeper into Queens to like Bayside. That'd be nice.
"One of my professors once said, ""spend good money on anything that comes between you and the ground.""

This would include walking shoes, socks, bed, carpeting, couches, tires, etc. I have found it is a good rule to live by."
"It's only gonna get worse imo, I'd draw a line."
"A study in Freakonomics performed by Steven Levitt, one of the authors, actually suggested that legalized abortion was the driving cause. Essentially, less unwanted children in low-income families led to less people pre-disposed to committing crimes. Roe v. Wade was in 1972 and crime rates began dropping right around when people born after this year would be reaching adulthood. Super interesting stuff imo."
Empower bicyclists — give tickets for parking cars in bike lanes and have much more drastic punishments for drivers who hit a bicyclist.
The tolls are too expensive.
Move /the fuck/ out of the way.
"The Midnight Moment in Times Square. Every night at around 11:57 PM all the screens in Times Square get taken over by an artist installation for about 5 minutes. The artists change every so often, and it's cool to see all the tourists react becuase no one ever knows it's coming. One of the only redeeming things in Times Square."
"Not an Easter egg but the city is full of so much interesting history and culture. Bookmark this link and whenever you are in the mood to explore check it out. It shows you nearby Wikipedia articles. This works anywhere in the world but it's consistently awesome in NYC.

If street level rentable commercial real estate is unoccupied for more than six months (and it isn’t under a minimum amount of renovation/construction) then the space can be used as shelter for the homeless.
"The sound bar at the 34th St station on the N/Q/R/W platforms. 

Put your hand up by the sensors and listen to the different sounds"
"Yes. Also, be aware you may find you catch every cold and flu that goes around for the first year. The microbiome is different here and spores/pollens may be different types than your immune system is used to, so you may need some time to adjust. Make sure you get enough sunlight/vitamin D and use replacements if you need to. Most of our time here is spent indoors and/or in shadow and we don't get enough sunlight. The first winter can be really hard, many of us have found."
"I don't know if most people do or not but you need renter's insurance. Period.

Unless you're well-off enough that you can replace all your shit if the building burns down or if some other disaster strikes."

"Yeah fuck that . If they were in her room then it’s whatever. But if you gotta come home from working all day for them to be chilling in the living room 4 nights a week that’s where I draw the line . Who wants to feel like a guest in their own house . 

I don’t know what he might be using that she isn’t using that would warrant him to have to pay anything . 

But I would def have a talk with her about staying in her room !"
obviously make everyone wear name tags
This city is going to put you through a LOT of walking shoes. Don’t skimp on your shoe supply. They’re going to help a lot with this.
"Saying, “I could NEVER live here!” is pretty fucking rude. I wouldn’t say that to you about your bumblefuck town, so don’t say it to me about where I live."
Are you drinking enough water?
Just require that car horns be just as loud inside the car as they are outside.

"There’s a sound installation in Times Square under one of the grates on 47th. Most people pass it by but if you listen out for it, there’s a weird hum coming from below."
Every time I see my credit card bill for my Metrocard.
Also when you’re exploring this check out Myzels candy store 140 w 55th during the week. It’s a tiny European candy store in midtown with the best licorice! Makes you feel like you’re not in NYC!
yeah let's talk about getting the presumptively working trains you actually paid for before diverting fare money to fucking with poor people.
"A stranger called me over to see it a few years ago, and now I never pass by without watching a few minutes of whatever. It was also mentioned in the last easter egg thread here a few months back."
"For real? You live in the Plaza Hotel and the bodega is in the lobby, perhaps?"
When subway train conductors stop in a station they are required to roll down the window and point at a stripe on the wall. THEY HAVE TO DO IT.
Family money probably.
"The abandoned City Hall station on the 6, and the ""Brodaway"" mosaic on the G."
I love it but it is disappointing that most of the time the train is going too slowly through that passage to make the most of the effect.
"He moved into the mansion in the UES and then every day takes an armada of SUVs to Brooklyn so he can work out at the gym and then takes his armada of SUVs to city hall where he starts work at 11am.

And then at 11:30am he does a press conference (that was scheduled for 10:45am) as to how bad global warming is and how we must stop it. And then he gets into his armada of SUVs to take him to JFK so he can fly to Iowa to tell them how much work he is doing in NYC"
"hung a thing on the wall next to my front door (on the inside of the apartment) that has a little tray for putting unsorted mail in, and has a few hooks to hang keys etc. from. 

&amp;#x200B;

now my entering-the-apartment routine includes having a designated place for my mail, keys, wallet, phone, and other essentials that I really don't want to accidentally forget where I left them."
There's a theory that the removal of lead pollution is attributed to the overall reduction of crime rates. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime\_hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis)

Exactly, great advice.  When you escalate a situation with a deadly or higher force weapon than the situation requires, you force your attackers to escalate their violence in response.  And if you don't really want to use yours, they'll use theirs.  Only respond when needed, otherwise try to ignore it."
"Agreed. Whenever I see shady shit going on in NYC, I just kind of watch to see if anything escalates. Engaging directly would be stupid because either you are also harassing this woman, or you'll escalate the situation and the guy in the car will do something to me when he would've otherwise just drove off. 

Best you can do is to just chill and call the cops if you witness an actual crime going down."
That coke better not be soda at that price.
All the lamposts in central park have different numbers with the closest street
That's obviously insufficient since rent continues to skyrocket while apartments and storefronts remain vacant.
"I ordered a salt-baked cipollini onion at a restaurant for like $80. I just needed to see what an $80 onion would taste like.

Pro-tip: tasted like a regular cooked onion"
