I don’t generally ask friend what their debt load is. Most of us use credit cards as debit cards for the perks. 
I was at a rooftop party and maybe 40-60 people watched a guy playing piano naked while getting his butt eaten out by a girl. Unforgettable image.
It is  a peculiarity of NYC that this question is not considered rude.
"Yes. But more frustrating is the design. Black text on a glowing white background is impossible to read from a distance, is energy inefficient, and will cause the screens to wear out much faster. White on black has none of these problems, and blends the information into the design of the device. The L line does it this way; not sure why the others didn't follow suit. 

And they could show 4 or 5 trains at once on there if the bottom row were like this:

Ⓐ 2m   Ⓒ 3m   Ⓕ 5m   Ⓐ 8m"

"I used to live across from The Ludlow Hotel just south of Houston.  One weekend (all day Saturday and Sunday), there was a photographer doing nude photo shoots of many different men in one of the rooms. At first I thought they were oblivious to the fact that anyone could see them because they were taking a lot of shots against the window, and then one of the models saw me and my roommate staring from across the street and pointed and waved. Hello!"
"I would avoid most Manhattan clubs if you don't want bottle service style clubs. I would also avoid them because the music is generic edm or top 40, too many bros / douchey people, overpriced, shit crowds in general. Sometimes I'll be surprised with a good night, but 8/10 I'd avoid.  


Bushwick/Ridgewood tend to have the most clubs that won't cost an arm and a leg, and have pretty chill people. Resident Advisor will often post good events going on, the earlier you buy tickets the cheaper they tend to be. Some clubs are free or very cheap if you go on Sundays/Weekdays. There's also Union Pool in Williamsburg, if you want less of a techno club and more of a bar that has a little bit of everything (dance floor, chill spots, taco truck). Easy to meet girls there in the chill spots or while waiting for 10 minutes to get a drink. Gets crowded and a bit bro-y on weekends unfortunately, but it's still a lot of fun. Arrive before 11PM on weekends if you don't want to wait in a long line.  


As far as clubs go, Elsewhere is a good choice, typically house and techno music although they also have bands some weekday nights I believe. Although the prices are pretty high compared to most Brooklyn clubs. Great sound system and DJs. You can also check out TBA, it's more of a bar lounge with DJs, low key spot but probably a good place to have a couple drinks, start out a night, meet some people. Also look into Good Room and 101 Brooklyn.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're INTO sweaty bro-fest top 40 bars, then, your best bet is the Woods. I don't think it's possible to have a sustaining conversation with girls there though. Freehold used to be good, and plays more indie dance style music, but it's gotten too crowded, haven't been there in years. Used to be a ton of fun though.

"""It seems like keeping up with the Joneses is a big part of the culture for people in their 20s-30s in NYC.""

I feel like this is really the opposite of the truth unless your living in Soho and have mostly rich friends. Most people here seem to be very, very open about their struggles financially in a way that I never saw in other places. Its probably the #1 topic of discussion I see among 20-30 year old's, how financially difficult their lives are with the high cost of living and how they have to make cut backs.

That being said, I am a bit older (30s now) but yes, most of my friends have moderate amounts of credit card debt. But then again I also live in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood (bushwick, been here since the 90s) and so the pressures of rapidly rising rents might have an impact in that regard.  "

"No success stories, but I am always surprised when I have points. I feel as though I've shopped there a lot but only ever get $3 at most before I notice. The thing is, the cashiers never tell me I have points after I scan my card. You think something would pop up for them, and they would ask. I always have to coincidentally open up the Duane Reade card in Apple Wallet before I ever notice.

CVS should have a rewards program where the more points you get, you can get to a rewards level with smaller receipts."
"One time I saw a guy tear through all of the books in his bookshelf. He’d flip each one open with the pages facing the floor, shake it, throw it in frustration, then grab another book and repeat the cycle. I was watching for a while until he noticed me then furiously shut his blinds. "

"I go out every Friday and Saturday. And maybe a third day in the week. The amount I spend varies wildly depending on which friend group I'm with. Anywhere from $60 in a night to $200. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I'm sure its added up, since I hardly ever stay in for a weekend"

"1) talk to your neighbors. Collective action can be powerful here.

"I mean she had a normal average body but her face was buried in a butt so, i guess so?"
"I'm in my 30s now. I spend 40-100 a week. Trivia is ~$40 including a big tip. Limit myself to 1 cocktail or 1-2 beers on other weeknights I go out. I don't go that hard on the weekends anymore. I average less than a drink a day now.

I could easily go over 100 a night in my mid to late 20s, and I went out at least twice a week. But my hangovers got worse and my drinking went way down.

If you're budgeting but feel like you need to keep up for social reasons, I'd recommend Moneyballing it - find the range where it's still really fun (3-5 drinks? 4-6 drinks?) and limit yourself to the low end of the range. Moving to the high end of the range is paying more for the same experience, and going past your range is throwing money away for something you don't enjoy as much."
"Fuck yes they do!

A train's pulling in? Oh, and it's a local train. Well, I wanted to take the express train.

"It's also been my experience that people are open about discussing it. I think it's because the apartment hunt is such a ubiquitous nyc experience, everyone went through it and can relate, and it's pretty common knowledge how much the average apartment in a certain neighborhood costs. I wonder if it also has to do with the fact that everything is right there on streeteasy, it's hardly a secret how much a building costs to live there. "

Do you understand it is a cheap for a reason?

How are you deeming it an ""excellent"" deal?

Why would you pay $400 a month for an apartment you may never ever get to live in during your life time AND AT BEST is a net negative $400/month cash flow property. You are going to pay a large down payment for the privilege of losing $400/month.

Do you even have the money saved for the down-payment and closing costs? If you di you would likely make more profit simply investing it in an index fund. 

Have you considered unexpected expenses? What if the tenant does not pay rent? You need to pay a lawyer. What if the apartment is damaged? What if the building has some sort of catastrophe not covered by insurance and you are faced with an assessment?

[This is an example of the above happening.](https://ny.curbed.com/2006/1/3/10610066/the-hole-situation-update-castle-village-gets-the-bill)

When the current tenant reached age 62 they can apply to have their rent frozen. They could also have a spouse, partner or relative take over the lease the same as any other rent stabilized property. 

Before you reply ""but why do landlords buy rent stabilized buildings"" realize that is on a much larger scale. They have turnover, betterments, and operate the facility in the way to make a positive cash flow. A real challenge to do with a single apartment. 

Not to mention if and when the tenant gets old an feeble and you are dealing with issues that arise to protect your position you will get labeled the ""bad guy"" in any conflict over rent, tenancy, damages, etc. 

All of the above issues now ON TOP of the fact that co-ops are less desirable than condos because of the co-op board. 

If you are REALLY insistent on this property then crunch the numbers so at least you have a positive cash flow and make an offer to buy at an asking price that reflects that and even THEN I would not do this myself. 

If you are really itching to own property buy a small hose or condo way upstate to use as a vacation home/ airbnb or something. 

I know nothing very little about Real Estate so I am certain someone else could elaborate in more detail however on a common sense level this makes zero sense.

"A DR cashier once told me they’re “not supposed to” give us a heads up when we’ve accrued enough points for a reward.
