"Defendant is apprehended for warrants, and asks judge for bail.  Tells judge he moved and was not served with the warrants. Some question as to his identity. Judge asks Defendant where he was born - Def says ""Puerto Rico."" (Defendant totally looks Mestizo; not Puerto Rican at all)  Judge asks ""Where in Puerto Rico?"" Defendant says ""San Juan."" Judge asks Defendant, ""When were you last in San Juan?"" Defendant says ""A couple of years ago.""  Judge ask Defendant, ""How did you get there?"" Defendant replies, ""I went on the Amtrak.""  Judge would not grant bail. When you flunk geography, it's for a long time. "
Def true. Run out of lives in 8-3? Return to 8-1 with three lives. 
"I was in college, sleeping with different men every night, failing some classes in college, and turning my entire track team against me. I had zero friends. I didnt care what happened to me, so i wasnt careful about anything. I researched the most effective ways to commit suicide, local gun laws, secluded forested areas where i could half bury myself so my body wouldnt be found, ect. Wrote a couple drafts of suicide notes, and raised the money to buy a gun. Told no one.

Then i met a man who refused to sleep with me until I actually wanted to, and he meant really, truly wanted to, not just as a reflex to him finding me attractive and subconsciously believing i owed it to him.(and he was smart AND sexy, so i def wanted to, but he made me wait.) We talked about dumb stuff, but he always made me laugh. He got me thoughtful gifts and listened to me vent. We did romantic things that you wouldnt expect to be romantic, like meeting in a parking garage and watching the city lights play on the river below. I fell in love with him, and I kept repeatedly thinking, i just want to see him one more time, and then maybe i'll go.

We're married now, and Im so glad I'm still here. He saved my life."
"I feel like your dad would be glad that this, usually, mournful process turned out to make you guys laugh. Also there’s a hilarious scene like that in a movie “Big Lebowski”, def recommend "
"I came from upper middle class and my husband came from poverty and this topic is soooo fascinating to me because of it. We make about 60k/year together, so his family thinks of us as having money and treat us almost like the leaders of the family. Like if anything bad happens, they turn to us for advice or help. they def don’t ask for handouts by any means, but I feel like they respect us more maybe? My family on the other hand tiptoes around money matters with us and seems to think we’re super poor. They don’t know how wealthy they are so our life blows their minds sometimes. Like I can’t just take a day off of work to go see them or drive 10 hours away for a fly fishing excursion. They don’t get why I stay in a job I hate or why I don’t get to enjoy the same hobbies that I used to (you know the ones that cost lots of money). I think our backgrounds gave us a great diversity of experience to draw from and I feel really fortunate to have the lifestyle that I do. "
