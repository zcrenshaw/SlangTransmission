"""YOU SOLD ME A BAD PRODUCT""

""Nope.""

""FUCK YOU""

Not even a frickin apology, I don't understand these people"
I hate that managers do not support their employees
LOL I think after the 3rd explanation attempt I would have just said “Shhhhh! The $5 discount is my gift to you!”  XD
"Usually if there's a discount, I don't question it LOL 

I mean, I usually understand it, though. Clearly this lady did not.

I've had customers like this. I had one guy pissed that he was charged for a new textbook when he got used. The lines were also super long because it was the beginning of the semester and everyone was getting books.

So I explained to him that I'm going to refund the price of the new and then re-buy it as used and the difference would go on his card, saving him from the pending refund where the money isn't usable. It was my bad for explaining it, because he didn't understand. ""I don't WANT to buy it again! I ALREADY BOUGHT IT!"" and wouldn't put his card in. I was relatively new at the job and kept trying to explain it, but in retrospect I would have just said, ""Ignore everything I just said and just put your card in and you'll get exactly what you want. You'll see."" 

Instead he demanded a manager and yelled at me telling me I didn't know what I was doing and then when the manager did the same thing I was explaining to him and he was still pissed. ""Do I get some sort of discount for my inconvenience?"" 

No, sorry. Being an ass and an idiot doesn't merit a discount."
It always makes us look like the jerks when managers enable customers. Ugh.
6 hours of labor for an alternator? Gettin hosed
"Like I, personally, slapped his mother and pissed in his Cheerios."
It also backs up the customer’s point that “they always do this for me.” No one should get special treatment. Managers should stand their ground.
&gt;We've all heard stories of employees being fired or punished for tiny little financial mistakes. She's looking out for you. She's a bit extreme but has good intentions
"I had a lady look at her receipt after I checked her out. She came back over, (I didn't have anyone else in line, she wasn't disrupting anything), and says: You charged me $1.49 for the blueberries.

I'm waiting for the point.

Woman: The sign [on the sales floor] said they are $1.50. Do you need to change that? (She totally meant charge her for the extra 1¢ not change the sign).

I chuckled and replied: No ma'am, that's okay. You're totally fine!

Woman: Are you sure? I don't want to mess up anything.

Me, super big smile on my face: Yes, ma'am it's okay. Thank you for letting me know about the discrepancy.

What is with people **insisting** on paying more?!"
"You should’ve just let her pay the price she wanted to after the second explanation. If she has her heart set on paying more for a carwash I’m sure that’s possible, and if it ever clicks in her head and she asks for a refund you could easily put three more dollars on her card."
"What gets me is even when a website will interface with an inventory system, computerized inventory is not infallible. So just because the website queried an inventory database and came up with a &gt;0 and thus shows ""In Stock"" doesn't mean you actually have it. It is still best practice to pick up the phone and call so that an actual human being can confirm it is available for sale."
"Trying to understand those sort of people is physically painful. It's so simple, yet they cannot comprehend it."
"""And that, kids, is how I fucked some lady in a gas station bathroom who could barely function as an adult.

I still fear to this day someone accusing me of abusing  a mentally handicapped person."""
"Nah. I work retail. Screw ups happen. Sometimes people steal things. It's basically a ""should be in stock if noone stole it or messed up"" notification then a ""100 percent this item is here. We're infallible"" type of notice."
"And it sets a precedent. Guaranteed that guy pulls this same thing again, and this time, he's not necessarily lying when he says you've done it before."
"The amount of people who come in my shop once or twice a month and bark ""my usual"" at me is insane.... You're not that memorable my dude I serve 200-300 people a day"
"If you could make those home brew kit small enough to stock every single one, they would be the ultimate microbrew."
"She doesn't have to pay,  she can find a cake elsewhere. I'm sure a generic cake that she uses a tube of icing to write on will look great!

Meanwhile you scrape off Jonathan and sell the cake to a grateful parent."
"I work at a theater where we have $6.99 tickets Monday through Thursday. A customer asks for a ticket, and her total comes to $7.53. She asks because she thought they were $7 and I let her know that's before sales tax. It says it on the banner outside. So she says okay, hands me a $10, and I give her $2.47 in change. 

She looks at me like I'm an idiot and goes, uh, I gave you $10. I'm like, yeah, $7.53 + $2.47 is $10....she sighed and walked away acting like I ripped her off and like she's never heard of sales tax before."
"I work in fast food, and I’ve had this exact conversation dozens of times.

Me: “there’s a way I can ring that up cheaper and save you a couple dollars, give me one second.”

C: “No I want you to ring it up how I told you!”

Me: “um... okay.”

I never sit there and argue with anyone who wants to pay MORE for our services then we charge. I’ve had someone pay over 8 dollars for a cup of ice cream with a bunch of toppings that I would have been willing to charge 4 or 5 for but he wouldn’t have any of it."
"Whenever a customer has behaved like that, I have told them that they can either stop behaving that way, and speak with a normal voice, or leave. If they refuse, I call our security. If there is no security, I threaten to call the police. I get that some customers are just over the top angry, and mean no harm besides being absolute jerks, however, you never know if an irate customer is just putting on a performance or if they plan to hurt people."
"It reminds me of this time some guy was buying a chair at our office supply store. He was going through checkout and wanted to buy our extended warranty on it. The cashier offered to bundle the warranty with the build, because the bundle (for that price of chair) was cheaper than just getting the warranty on its own. It went something like this:

Cashier: ""oh, would you like me to bundle your warranty with the build? It comes out to 2 dollars cheaper"" (might've been 5 bucks cheaper I can't remember)

Guy: ""what? No?! I don't want you guys to build it I'm doing that myself""

Cashier: ""I know sir, but if we bundle it together it just saves you a little bit of money whether we build it here or not""

Guy: ""I don't know what you don't understand, I don't want it build here so stop trying to make me buy it, just ring it through already""

Cashier: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


It's times like these where I think maybes it's easier to just secretly give them the discount and hope they realize what we did for them, or don't notice it. But you know they'll see something *strange* on the receipt and come back in losing their mind and not accepting any explanation."
All this over 5%.  Some people make me tired.
"How long *should* it take anyway?  My and and a friend of mine replaced my car's alternator a few years ago, and I swear it took all fuckin' day.  Granted, neither of them are professionals, so that certainly played a hand in it, but it was actually comical at how long that took them."
Yeah but at that point why even have the online stock thing then? It’s like saying ‘call to make a dinner reservation but sometimes we lose the sheet so come by in person and wait around until a table opens up anyway...’
"""I haven't been called a loser since 4th grade."" That says alot about the man's maturity level."
"My response whenever someone goes off on a ""I can't believe you don't know me"" tirade (usually when I'm carding them) is 

""What's my name?""

*Deafening silence*

""Yeah I don't know you either."""
"Did you call the other store and warn them to have security on hand? If not, what did they do to you, kick your dog?"
"Depends what it is, Volkswagen are notoriously difficult last one I did was on a 90s Jetta took about 2.5hrs, but If i were to do one on my own truck just a ram 1500 take less than a half hour"
"It's not her fault she couldn't be bothered to a) pick an image that would include numbers b) include any numbers c) pick up her phone. She's busy being a Karen, don't you know who she is?!?! /s"
"If they were together, why didn't they just combine purchases? That way they get 5% off."
To be fair I think only America does the surprise sales tax thing. I live in a place with a lot of tourism and am constantly the first person to tell foreigners about sales tax.
"Yeah, this lady was being kind. Mine was not. lol"
"Update for anyone who wants it...

Boss said she want worried about it at all. 

She spoke to cashier while I was at lunch. Cashier told her “that woman had problems”

All is good."
