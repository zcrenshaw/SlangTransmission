"Stan Lee. 

It's gonna be really sad when he goes

Edit: I didn't mean to :'("
"Bold of you to assume Stan Lee can die

Edit: RIP Stan Lee"
It’s crazy that the last person killed by one of these threads was Harper Lee. Now Stan Lee. Hold on tight to your Lee’s.
"Seriously, there was a thread in here I was reading earlier on today about who you can’t believe is still alive and someone mentioned Stan Lee. 

No frickin way. "
I CANT BELIEVE YOU KILLED STAN LEE
"That aged poorly 

Edit: Also R.I.P Stan Lee "
"My Stan Lee story:



About 4-5 years ago I was in Chicago going to school for animation.

Comicon was in town but I had to work and didn’t have the money to go anyways.

Anyways I worked at Dunken Donutes and got good with the owner so I was basically his errand boy. 

I was delivering bagels and donutes to another store on foot. I was standing at the corner of wabash and another street, forgot the name, waiting for the light so I could catch a train to another part of downtown.

Next to me was this old man with white hair and shades. I am a pretty talkative person but instead I found myself just staring at him.

He caught me staring and raised his eyebrows at me. I apologized and explained that he just looked so familiar...


He winked at me and said, “I get that a lot.”

Turned and walked away. About an hour later I found out Stan Lee was in Chicago for that Comicon and I’ve been kicking myself ever since.

He was up there with Toriyama Akira and Hayao Miyazaki for me. The people I’ve always wanted to just sit down with and drink coffee.


I’d really like to hear yours too if you have them."
"Not only did this man create an empire that almost everyone loves, but he was a genuine man who just loved to see people smile. 

I had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy.  He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  

I remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. 

Or how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves ""what I didn't hear you!"" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  

My time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.   

RIP Stan.  "
Stan Lee did too
"My story isn't as cool, but I got to see him up close at comic con. He passed by and some guy said, ""Stan Lee you're awesome!"" And he said ""You're right."" It was pretty funny."
"* Brian Wilson, lead singer of the Beach Boys. He's 'only' in his seventies, but losing two brothers, massive drug &amp; alcohol problems, being overdosed on antipsychotics by a manipulative shrink to the point of causing nerve damage, living with a schizoaffective disorder... he's been through a lot.

* Doris Day. Fun fact: Doris Day is the mother of music producer Terry Melcher, who worked closely with the Beach Boys (and may or may not have been targeted by Charles Manson).

* Olivia de Havilland, aka Maid Marian in the 1938 *Robin Hood* movie starring Errol Flynn.

* Robert Mugabe, former Marxist dictator of Zimbabwe. I'm most surprised that he survived his recent coup.

* John Goodman. Sure, he lost a lot of weight, but he still spent a good amount of his life obese and alcoholic.

* Mikhail Gorbachev. Especially considering how he's a vocal Putin critic.

* 10th US President John Tyler still has two living grandsons.

* ~~George H.W. Bush, the longest-lived ex-President~~.

* Bob Barker.

* ~~Stan Lee~~."

"A friend and I snuck into a premiere party for a movie. That’s an r/actlikeyoubelong story on its own. But we spotted Stan Lee, surrounded by a posse. A lot of pretty girls and some serious handlers. Here we were, just average idiots in a place we weren’t supposed to be. 

We approached, just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work. The handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along. He stopped the handlers and said hello to us. I got to shake his hand and thank him. He asked if we had cameras. I was kinda dumb-struck by the moment, and forgot cameras existed. He actually wanted to pose for pictures with us.

Still have the photo, and a nice memory of a pretty great guy who was good to his fans.

And there goes Stan Lee
"Hey man, I always liked you. Don’t show up to choir practice on time tomorrow. 

-your biggest fan Mr. Stan "
"Stan Lee

Edit: Are these threads cursed or something? My original comment was posted a week ago.  I woke up to check my phone and I got a notification from this app. I checked on Google and real life just hit me on the face. No one would be able to replace him as he is a legend for his comic books and movies based off of them. It really sucks that this happened. :'(

Omfg! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

For your information, I just commented and it wasn't me who published this question. I didn't realize these types of questions were taboo to answer or Ouijaish to begin with. :/

 I would appreciate it if we all type :( to pay respects.

I'll start...

YOU FUCKING KILLED HIM

Edit: Tagging this user as 'the guy who killed Stan Lee'"
Stan Lee :-(
"Yes officer, this comment right here... it's the one that killed Stan Lee."
Out of everyone who could have been jinxed. Why Stan Lee :( RIP 
"Since I grew up with superheroes and their ideas of morals, protecting the innocent, ect. I feel like it really shaped me morally, and gave me an interest in criminology and upholding the law. RIP Stan Lee!"
"I actually have one too!

I was working at a convention quite a few years ago as a guest liaison and it by far is one of my favourite memories of working at cons. We were told by an organizer that under no circumstance we were to talk to him, look at him or acknowledge him – he was far above us as people and as volunteers we (essentially) weren’t worthy. 
The Saturday of the con I dropped my guest off at their panel and realized that I hadn’t eaten yet today so headed off to the green room. As it was mid afternoon I figured that it was an okay time for me to be in there because most guests either had panels, photo ops, or were at their tables – so in I went (for context the green room was essentially a giant square with chairs along the edge of the wall and the food on a large table in the middle). I grabbed a plate of grapes and chocolate and plopped down in a chair  and muttered something to myself about the con food. That’s when I heard paper rustling and who else was across the room sitting in the corner reading a paper but Stan Lee, he looks at me and says “you know, the food doesn’t get much better unfortunately. But the cheese platter is usually the best bet”. I stopped mid grape in my mouth- not so much because I was having a fan girl moment but because of our very very explicit instructions not to speak to him WHAT SO EVER. I’m assuming that he then thought that I was some crazy fan because I’m not talking or eating, so he takes the beat to introduce himself to me as if I didn’t know who he was. I decided that at that moment to just say fuck it and talk to him because what would they do fire me? So I introduced myself. We had a very short conversation about the weather (it wasn’t very nice – but at least there was no snow) and how it’s hard to find good cup of coffee sometimes (don’t go to Tim Hortans, please there are better ones in my city). Then that was it, I had to go back and fetch my guest and I didn’t want him to feel like he had to entertain me. I thanked him for talking to me and headed out, but before I could leave the room he pointed at me and said “just don’t eat the mozzarella”.  

TL;DR - I have a brief conversation with Stan Lee, he's very nice to me and recommends the cheese platter, but not the mozzarella"
