12,Girls. Just girls. 
13,"If you're worried that you're not going to become President one day because footage of you belting out a couple choruses of ""It's Raining Men"" somehow finds its way onto the web, allow me to reassure you that it's not a dealbreaker."
14,Shaggy
15,"You guys hooked up? Nice dude, right on brother."
16,"When I think of feminists today, Joan of Arc definitely comes to mind. Burning them at the stake is not a half bad idea."
17,"To take out communists.

When was the last time you used your fingers for something other than typing bullshit or jerking off?

You don’t need your fingers"
18,How in the hell would they see this post
19,Don't take your case for a generality.

21,So how are these blind people going to see this?
22,"Does someone read out this post to blind people and they have to reply out loud cos that would be be very awkward. ""Ayo, Mike, this post is asking what you masturbate to?"" ""Ducks. Just say ducks. All kinds."""
23,Damn how do i read this shit.

31,How do you have down votes for this? 
32,"Yes he does. From the ""Powers"" section of the Marvel Database:

&gt; Xavier is capable of a low-level form of telekinesis, it is unknown how much weight Xavier is capable of lifting with his telekinesis. It is known however that he is capable of lifting himself and his wheelchair up a flight of stairs, shunting Magneto into Earth's atmosphere and exploding the ball of metal which [Magneto](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Ultimate_Magneto) was (presumably) contained within, protecting himself from explosions, and levitating a [Sentinel](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Sentinel).

33,How is romantic gestures not related to strong emotions?
34,"Rich kid.  

Go to private school where you are sexually abused and become an abuser. Daddy donates a wing to Harvard and you cheat your way to a degree in business. Daddy's friend gives you a nice job as vice president somewhere. You are promoted to C-suite by 30. Fire and backstab and threaten (and actually look into people to beat people up for you).   

Get fired for raping one of the slaves on the plantation. Sorry, I mean ""employees."" Ride golden parachute to safely land in your mansion. Retire at 40 and respawn more evil, spoiled spawn."
35,"Are you being deliberately obtuse here. Because i am trying to ask a genuine question. Nothing states there that you have to own a gun, only that you can. 

Are you in a well regulated militia? 

&amp;#x200B;"
36,The thing I want to stress is that your attractiveness is subjective. Being nice and making people feel important is what will make you be attractive. Looks aren't what most people think. They are subjective and lay in someone else's mind. There is no physical beauty to make a  cruel selfish person attractive to most.
37,Your the kinda of person killing this country 
38,"You do know you can’t control how others think. I don’t like that group I have the right to not like them, as long as I don’t harm one of them physically "
39,"OK, but the question is why is this one applicable to you "
40,"Magic: the Gathering

Haha just kidding. That shit gets complicated fast. You gotta know the basic rules like the turn phases and how the spell stack and combat damage works, but if you want to get good you gotta learn the metagame of whatever format you choose, and memorize all the cards in your deck and every opponent's deck and the statistical probability of them coming up."
41,I feel like she's not that well known unless you watch Brooklyn 99. 
42,Someone listened to NPR this morning

44,If they watch American news 
45,"Don't be sorry about that.. we have the right to say hurtful things and have the right to offend. You have the right to be offended. But taking away any kind of offensive content will only stiffle and degrade ""progress"" as a human species. Too bad there's so many idiots like you that are willing to hand in their rights cause they think a hurt ego is more important.. This is why I hate my own generation and why younger generations shun us..

&amp;#x200B;"
46,"Obviously nobody is perfect, and we shouldn't get too upset over getting a story wrong or maybe a little too much extra coverage.

But the leftwing media has not gotten **anything** correct in the last 3 years. I am just curious as to why their viewers are not calling for some major changes to prevent this embarrassment from happening again."
47,"NPR non biased, uh you might want to check yourself again. "
48,"Grilled Cheeses taste better if you cum on the cheese before you melt it. It's a subtle improvement, but consistently identified based on single-blind testing (N=4). It's also possible that it goes better with sea salt rather than table salt, again single blind, but N=1. "
49,Bruh article 13
50,"I remember my last night in Kiev like it was yesterday even though it was six months ago. Semi-automatic machine gun fire, screeching tires, five or six police car sirens, more gunfire (right across from arab market downtown) and me trying to translate what ""stray bullet"" meant to my friends by text and asking them if it was on the news. News? Nah... just a normal day in Ukraine.


Gangster action aside-- Kiev is an incredible city which everyone should visit before Putin nukes it."
51,"When I was in tokyo and Osaka, a lot of the people were saying “psycho” to refer to something as cool. This was amongst a younger crowd tho, age range of like 20-24. "
52,"Well the thing is anti-vaxxers aren't necessarily these evil boogeymen hellbent on summoning epidemics.  If you can empathize with this story then imagine this...   a good portion of ""pro-plaguers"" have full faith in vaccines previous to some reaction that frightens them into abandoning  it - however with many it doesn't always play out that their pediatrician grants them exemption from future shots... 

The other thing ought to jump out about this tragedy... *this exemption came a bit late - only after catastrophic irreversible brain damage had occurred.*  The worst possible outcome of a measles infection has already occurred, so any notion of protecting this individual with herd immunity has officially lost the plot - the push for herd immunity was responsible.  There is a very callous, blind hatred which largely prevails on these boards directed against parents who want nothing more than to keep their children safe.  Just take a step back.  "
53,So what you're saying is that 49 countries **without support from their civilians**) including America decided to start a war and invade an innocent country because MUH 9/11
54,Nah it's the absolute truth actually
55,Guns
56,Whenever I see couples on the same side they are alwaaays way to touchy feely. also I dont get why you wouldn't want to see the other persons face. I love sitting across from my gf when we go out for that reason. Save the touchiness for home ya weirdos!
57,Or mandatory sterilization of all infants.
58,Because they're pretty dependent on single-issue evangelical voters and war makes certain people a lot of money.
59,Which is why there have been so many movie theatre shootings other than that one time?
60,"As someone who is pro gun control, only 1 and 2 are any justification. I don't care if it's fun, I don't care if you think it's neat, I don't care if you're petty and want to own one just because someone said that you shouldn't. Self defense is really the only justification, and the only one that remotely comes close to justifying the dangers of gun ownership."
61,But why comment if ur not finna upvote
62,All of you are whiny babies 
63,"What's a truck conversion kit? Does it allow it to turn into an Autobot? ***snicker***

70,"nether, both are bad and overatted."
71,"&gt; Carrying balances on credit cards.

Not always.  I have a balance on my credit card that I probably won't pay off in full until July.  But I opted to put my money instead in high investment funds and ISAs.  Just don't spend like an idiot and pay off at least double the minimum payment every month, aim to clear the balance within 6 months and you'll be fine.  Your credit rating will sky rocket.


Spending a credit card and paying it off immediately actually does nothing for your credit.  But sensible and responsible juggling of your funds and long term planning will.


I have about £1,500 on my credit card right now.  I earn at least £2k a month from my job alone (I tutor and mentor in my spare time) and it goes up come June.  My bills and expenses are max £1,100.  But because I like to put money in my ISAs and trackers, I will pay off this 'miniscule' balance abit slower.



So I cannot agree with your experience."
72,Pewdiepie vs. Tseries
73,he hasn't been in a live action movie since '97. what you talkin' bout?
