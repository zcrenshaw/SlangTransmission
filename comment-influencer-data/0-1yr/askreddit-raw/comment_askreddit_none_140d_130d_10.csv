1,"Because I was being sarcastic, rather than legitimately condescending like you."
2,"I'm honestly not sure what you stand to gain from spreading blatant lies. 

With the exception of the retarded ""don't drive while black"" and ""don't carry cash"", everything else was true. I don't know if you're just anti cop, a lame troll, or someone that seriously has no clue how the Fourth Amendment works, but there's no reason to be this dishonest."
3,"I've heard of some sick fucks basically making lolicon ""which is completely illegal and considered child porn"" but making a small backstory saying the character is older to avoid legal repercussions / scrutiny, disgusting stuff honestly and i wish the worst to people who genuinely get a kick out of it."
4,"Imagine the worst possible political debates (ignorant yet certain, assume anyone with different opinion is the 'other side'/bot/fox news viewer, personality cult, think that grand policies can happen immediately, conspiracy theories)."

11,"Abortions. More than 100,000 occur each day, and they count for ~41% of all deaths. Don‚Äôt want a debate about it rn."
12,"Sure will keep one from bitching about lesser agitations though, that's the point at least. Nobody wants to raise a whiny little shit."
13,"I'm sorry, did you just assume your gender?"
14,"I still believe that air conditioners cause colds. Makes sense in my head, due to the sudden temp changes when going outside."

19,"‚ÄúIsrael just grew 10%‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt grow at all. We‚Äôve had that land since 67‚Äô. Nothing changed except the United States recognized it. Israelis have been living there for 52 years already.

And yes, we are disproportionate but that has nothing to do with a conspiracy. Jews are just raised in a very strong community that has historically been forced to work as Bankers, Doctors, Merchants, w.e. Because no one allowed us to own land. However when capitalism took off, these roles became extremely powerful. 

Same could be said that Blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, Eastern-Europeans hold a disproportionate little amount of power given their population too."

22,Fuck Lost.  That show was the biggest disapointment to watch live. They promised us it wasn't Purgatory for 6 years only for it to be essentially purgatory in different words.  Most annoying 6 years of my life.

71,That‚Äôs just blatantly false. Soft sciences and liberal arts are taught by people who are pushing an agenda. The fact that you even said that shows that you are just believing what some irrelevant newscaster or teacher told you.

76,"I will provide evidence if this gets attention. But a few I believe in are: JFK was more than reported, Something shady there. 9/11 was shady, I dont believe it was purely government but I do think they had a part. Obama wasn't born In the US(this one is just fact not really conspiracy) and some shit surrounding the moon landing is fake. I think the original moon landing was real, but I do think some thing the us GOVT said wasn't real"
77,Yeah but that last midterm was like a week or two after some right winger shot up a Synagogue.
78,"Holocaust contains numerous lies.

Here are a few key reasons why:

1. Only ""death camps"" were found outside Germany and were coincidentally liberated by the Soviets. All camps liberated by Americans had no ""gas chambers"". Why wouldn't Germans have these camps in their own country?

2. The logistics are scientifically impossible. It is literally impossible to cremate thousands of bodies a day with the technology they had back then, even the cremation tech today couldn't pull it off. Aside from that, if you look at the ""gas chamber"" doors, they were made of wood and had large gaps underneath. Zylkon b is an extremely toxic substance and if it was released without an airtight seal it would have killed every other person inside the buildings.

3.  The facilities had leisure activities and even medical care on site. You can even see the remnants of swimming pools etc. at the camps today. The prisoners were also allowed to participate in things like theatre, and were served beer. There are countless videos on YouTube of real survivors stating these things.

4. Hitler literally signed an agreement allowing Jews to be transferred to Israel. Seems odd that a man so hell bent on extermination would allow this, no?

5. The actual German military had several Jewish officers in it. Google it.

6. Many fabrications about the holocaust have already been debunked quite thoroughly, such as the lamps made of human skin. The official number has also be revised several times.

7. Jews weren't the only ones put in work camps. The populations of the camps contained gypsies and many other non-jews.

8. No plans found. The Nazis were extremely thorough in regards to documentation and what their plans were. They were meticulous in every other aspect, yet we are supposed to accept that an extremely complex and dangerous process was merely carried out by word of mouth? Right.

So now you might be thinking, ""wow this guy is a Nazi"" or ""I can't believe you think that Auschwitz is fake"". Well, the Germans most definitely put jews in camps. I merely refuse to believe that they were systematically exterminated. They died of starvation due to allies bombing supply lines, as well as typhus. Typhus was the reason their clothing and hair were removed, and was the reasourn zyklon b was used to delouse said clothing. This is why we can find traces of zyklon b in the camps.

Of course, this post will be met with ad hominem attacks or be removed entirely, which will simply just strengthen by beliefs."
79,"I don't believe, I know."

81,"I believe in the pizzagate conspiracy i strongly believe that there is a worldwide elite pedophile ring and has satanic undertones, wikileaks letters from podesta and obama and Hillary clinton talking about cheese pizza and all that stuff.

83,"I would probably commit suicide in a week if I had to live life the way you think it should be lived.

I am incapable of understanding how a relationship can be ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù when you have to grit your teeth to be in the same room as someone else for an hour.

As for ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù, if you mean travel? Fuck you. Travel is horror on top of horror on top of horror. Leave me alone in a comfortable apartment with nobody to bother me and let me get on to really, truly living!"

111,"She was a normal kid in high school but I was her friend not her parent. She was larger than the other students by atleast a few feet. Before everything happened one could say we had perfect lifes. The summers were hot, the winters mild and everyone was involved in the community. Many a nights were spent at her house by the firepit with a cold one in my hands. 

That was until see started looking into Criptids and Folk lore. Sophomore year I think it was when she claimed the first one. Of course none of us knew what she had become.

That was until she reached out to me tired, broken, and hopeless. Telling me she needs about tree fiddy then I saw the monster she became."

115,"&gt; No amount of trauma or daddy issues is going to make you put someone through the kind of misery he inflicted upon his child's mother.

Do you have a source for this claim? How could you know the extent of what trauma could and could not prompt you to do?
