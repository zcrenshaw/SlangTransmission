1,"could be contaminated product, as the flu vaccine is made in large batches in unregulated third world countries.

could also be an allergy to the ingredients."
2,"I agree with you. I don't feel that it's necessary for flu, and chickenpox was taken care of by exposure at a young age (annoying for kids, risky for adults) I'm caught up on all my other vaccines and so is the rest of my family"

6,Biscuits and gravy? I think you’re confused with those northern folk. The only gravy in the south goes on some nice roast beef. 
7,  The strong will survive.  You act like we need every born human.  You are probably the type of parent that would have a down syndrome kid over an abortion.  Life is a reward for health not some magic ride.
8,"what word do you not understand, or is it the whole you don't understand? I'm willing to educate you on the meaning if you like."

12,"Dude, this is rambling.  Go see a shrink"

14,Not really. American gun laws are almost as stupid and dangerous as not vaccinating.
15,"And out of those 33% most of them are gang violence or people that were probably gonna get capped anyways. 

Yeah those ""families of victims"" more than likely the ""victim"" had it coming. 

Sucks for the ones that didn't, but life is mean and scary like that, people die everyday g. "

17,"I mean, I know I jumped the gun a bit. But this is the most downvotes I've ever gotten, for simply making a guess at a cause of someone's odd behavior. I'm not sure what I could put in my original comment to make my point clearer, but I think at this point people see downvotes and continue the trend, like a series of upvotes makes a trend. "
18,"Its also extremely ""racist"" to make fun of muslims  who are the vast majority of people on earth marrying not only cousins, sometimes siblings as well. "
19,Sure. Wanna make an argument or shall I assume that we're referring to black people supposedly being killed at a disproportionate rate?
20,"A Christian is 100% sure that Christ is their savior.

30,"Well Alonso might be considering NASCAR to get the Triple-Crown so lets see. He even ran a race, i forget which one last year."
31,"Yeah, I’m not saying it’s right. I guess more like “it’s really not as bad as it sounds”. Eventually I started appreciating the tolerance the family shows them. It feels very Mr. Rogers. Though truthfully, they don’t steal like OP’s MIL. They just cause scenes to get all the attention and try to make absolutely everything go their way,"

35,"The only thing I hate about this is you’re the reason those restaurant workers can’t spend thanksgiving with their families. So I must give you the obligatory “go fuck yourself, you piece of shit” because I’m also in the service industry.


Unless it was a cultural restaurant who’s workers didn’t celebrate thanksgiving (like Chinese restaurants)."
36,"If you need to act like America is unusually bad to give your life meaning, something's wrong with you.

45,"Lol drugs aren't that bad, and if they are, because frankly I don't think there's any way to tell somebody drugs aren't bad if they've been told they are since they were young, then it's up to them to not use them. No point in punishing responsible users because other people can't use them safely."

57,Barry allen wants to know your location
58,"I'm going to discredit what you said because of the gender of your subject. I claim your anecdote is hardly notable at all, because it is far, far easier for a lone woman to find a group of (especially male) friends than a lone man. It's just how shit works.

Many people aren't going to like this because it may contradict their _specific_ experience. The overwhelming majority of the time, a new addition to a friend group has AT LEAST as many women as men. I have not once seen a dude successfully penetrate a friend group, long term, without bringing a girlfriend or female friend in as well, unless he was a truly extraordinary man. I'm not complaining about this or even wishing it were different, but this is the reality I've observed. Being a not ugly girl is having social life on easy mode, and this is fact.

Again, I take no issue with this because it's out of my control and I'm guilty of such behavior too. The only thing I can truly improve is myself."

67,"&gt;The most important thing is to make sure that no individual is uncomfortable in any way during sex and if that person is uncomfortable then both parties should immediately stop.

Wanna know how I know you're boring in bed?

68,Because all you need to do is not be stupid and work
69,"Why the fuck are you worried about a measles outbreak if you and yours are properly vaccinated? And if your vaccine is literally an inactive version of the disease in question and the process of making that disease inactive fails, uh... isn't that liable to cause a measles outbreak? 

Why is ""which vaccine is causing an allergic reaction out of this volley of vaccines I've taken"" not a legitimate question? 

And everybody involved in the process of vaccinating the masses isn't an MD or PhD, there's truckers delivering that shit, there's interns storing that shit. In some cases, there's phlebotomists administering it. I'm not equating my opinion to an MD or PhD, and my argument here isn't an opinion to begin with. Boiling it down? Spacing out vaccines allows you to more easily identify the effects of said vaccines. I don't give a fuck that you're an immunologist, it doesn't take a genius to realize that ""easily identifying the effects"" of something is good. "
70,That dude has 3 kids and definitely vasectomied
71,Because Americans are largely stupid and have no ability to appreciate history if they don’t agree with it.
72,"Yeah, anyone who wants to dictate that level of control on my life is controlling and abusive and can fuck off. 

Your partner does not have a right to censor your media content, or your masturbation habits. Anyone who attempts to is being abusive by doing so. "
73,"Disagreements are totally fine and were not the point of my comment at all.

It is the universal reddit opinion that anyone who is unemployed is so simply because life sucks and is biased against them.

If you say someone that is depressed needs to get off their ass, you’re hateful.

If you say you like pugs you’re the devil, even worse if you purchase a dog from a breeder instead of adopting off the street. "

91,"There is 100% a growing number of people, often women, that believe that cheating is an expression of their sexual freedom. Not saying it's common, or even that a large portion of women feel this way. But there is *absolutely* a strain of feminism that is encouraging women to cheat on their husbands in the name of empowerment. 

It's a response to the past (and I'm sure still present) ""a man's got needs"" bullshit. I'm sure everything you've said is *also* true, but both things can be true at the same time.

http://nymag.com/article/2016/05/women-are-now-cheating-as-much-as-men-but-with-fewer-consequences.html

I know I've made a grave error by suggesting there is a *small minority* of women that falsely  justify cheating with feminism, and it's not cool to JUST point out when women do shitty things. So here's something else I believe, it just wasnt relevant to the discussion so I didnt think I had to bring it up. There's also a *small minority* of men that want to bring back chauvanism and women exclusively homemaking.

There now that I've talked about both sides having crazies, may we all collectively unwad our panties?"
92,"When you’re manipulated and under such control and so young a predatory pedophile can really mess up your judgement. Her saying “I needed some maturity in the relationship” is something the pedophile implanted in her mind. Her cheating was almost out of her control. 

Edit: guys she was raped. Getting raped is not cheating. "
93,But you don't know that.
94,"I understand you want to push an identity politics, intersectional agenda, which is what I think your agenda is. Things don’t have to be political. What issue are being voted on or decided right now that indicate that anyone doesn’t think women or gay people or blacks don’t have equal rights? Name a single way that has worsened in the last two year? 

I am tired of people claiming some impending dome is coming to America because hey want to drive a wedge among Americans based on race or gender or sexual orientation, as if that is the most important quality a person has. "
95,"Not the same.  It's her problem at work, your work is not related to hers.  Way to miss the point of the thread!  She's coming to you for support, not solutions.  "

He also openly debates political views during family events like tomorrow.

We're a black family. 

edit: He brings up politics and then AGGRESSIVELY seeks to debate anyone that disagrees with Trump. Is that better?

Politics isn't something you just debate with people who don't really like you (we don't like him, he's an ass).

Kinda like religion."
