21,"In 6th grade, I sat in a hexagon table with the most annoying, attention seeking person in the class on my left, and the guy that had a smell my right. Everyone else was fine, since the attention-hog girl didn't attend from winter until next year (she came for Valentine's day, I wonder why). Thinking about it now, she could've had a health issues, but she'd be sick when she said she wasn't, and not sick when she was. Neither had great hygiene, since the attention-hog would sneeze and cough all over the table, and the smelly one was, well, smelly. The teacher had to have a talk with the class about hygiene, and most thought of them. Smelly guy just needed to wipe his ass more and put on deodorant, but attention-hog was so desperate for attention, she tried to get out of doing addition on a computer by ""sneakily"" pouring water on her eyes and saying she had a stomachache. She literally pretended to vomit just to get people to acknowledge her. She was also a bit obsessive, but that's off topic. 

Basically, just have good general hygiene: wash thoroughly, COVER YOUR ANKLES IN THE WINTER, sneeze and cough into your elbow, and wear socks when you wear shoes. All of these were a problem sadly."

Government does not have an infinite supply of cash to fund these programs and even higher tax rates would not suffice.  As far as universal healthcare I do agree and believe that it is the most probable in terms of feasibility. The UBI is a dream and not logical because there is no way to fund such a program  especially if every citizen gets it regardless. That part is too much socialist ideal to ever work in reality. I appreciate your long response, I think these are ideas that need to be discussed and again, healthcare is the only one I could ever see actually unfolding. "

45,"I saw Logan Paul at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”    

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.  "

I'm not a Trump supporter, but the Democrats could meet half way here. $5B is roughly $35 per taxpayer. Would create jobs and would put barriers up in areas that have none.

Illegal immigration and unsecured borders are an issue. Maybe not to the extent that Trump demonizes it, but it is a problem."
89,"Wrong.

His party DID have the votes, that’s why the $5.7B bill passed the house. He never attempted it before because he didn’t have the SENATE votes. He also acquired more republican senators (Kavanaugh etc) which increased the likelihood that it would pass which is why he did it now rather then before."

Also, I'm tired of people making me feel like it's a crime to be patriotic. Where I'm from, national pride has never been higher because we finally decided that we're going to take care of the problems in our own country first. There are illegals in this country right now who are hurting our economy and I agree that we need to get rid of them.

107,"There was a comment in one of these threads talking about how MAGA people would take the Covington Kids story and run with it, using it constantly because they don’t have any other evidence to support their claims, I would like to rebut this. 

There are many instances of people on the left acting badly, (and some instances of people on the right acting badly) 

There are the college campuses which were damaged by violent rioters in protest of people like Milo Yianopolis, there was a guy in the week after Trump was elected that was dragged out of his car and beaten by a mob while another cheered him on. (His car was then stolen) 
There was a guy who may or may not have actually been a white supreicist, (though, I don’t remember, he may have been a reporter) who was beaten by a leftist mob for being a white supremicist, and was saved by a black man layin* on him to stop them. There was a kid who had some mental deficincies who was kidnapped, and tortured on camera for supposedly voting for Trump. There have been many instaces of people doing attrocious things against MAGA people. There have been many misleading news articles dubbed “fake news” the problem with Covington wasn’t that you got it wrong, it was the response to this kid’s supposed crimes. Thousands of people on the internet, particularly here advocated lynching these kids. Murdering them. Doxxing them so at least their lives would be ruined, at worst they’d be targeted. Shooting them on sight. The worst is the disney guy who tweeted out that they should be put into a wood chipper. 
When I first saw the story, I assumed the kid was guilty too. I understand how people can get things wrong, but the left’s response to the situation shows how much the left despises MAGA people. People were threatening to murder children here. That’s a problem. 

Warning, there’s a lot of mispellings 8n here. "

110,"I didn't grow up like that and I share the same mentality. It isn't about a lack of empathy, is that we chose to rise above our situation and not spend money on wasteful things we don't need.

The problem is, that any time anyone suggests people are living paycheck to paycheck because they have horrible spending habits, it is immediately shut down or denied. 

That lack of accepting personal responsibility is what causes them to live paycheck to paycheck. If you keep making excuses for your poor behavior that is the reason you stay poor.

114,"&gt;There's no need to build a wall across the entire border.

Well...let's see. 

In the year 2000 there were at 1.64 million illegal immigrants caught crossing the border illegally. This is not the number that was crossing, this is the number that was caught. And that is just one year. 

The lowest it has been was 2012, with about 175,000 ""caught"" while trying to cross the border. 

For 2018, it's 400,000. Again, ""caught"" not the actual number of illegal crossing. 

The estimated number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. is around 12 million. 

It's estimated that are 600,000 people living here on expired visas. That means about 11 million came across the border and stayed here. 

And...a conservative cost of the 12 million illegal immigrants living here is about $54 billion a year. Trump said it's $200 billion a year. 

Trump only wants $5.4 billion to build the wall, which is 0.0338 percent of the budget. 

Don't think it's a problem? Since 1986 we have spent $283 BILLION on border security. "
115,"Thank you, I'd hope you can recognize how obviously rhetorical it is.  The main point is that while liberals are pushing for ways to fix the problems with healthcare, education, and poverty in our country, our president has shut down the government and is holding it hostage to fund a wall that the majority of America do not want."
116,A democracy that doesn't respond well to the wishes of its people. Which is a major problem that Americans continually forget. 
117,Good luck letting just anyone cross into the country 
118,"Compare the demographics that make up the liberal and conservative parties, then rethink your statement.  

Then, consider how military personnel are significantly more approving of Trump than the general population, which also doesn’t help your case. Then, take a peek at the electoral map and see how much of a logistical nightmare it would be to try and take over that much land.  Big cities could be surrounded and razed before a single triple shot macchiato was thrown to the sidewalk.

122,"&gt;Nobody took Trump too seriously in expecting Mexico to pay for the Wall.
&gt;&gt;1: Why not?

Because Trump says a lot of things that people don't take too seriously. I took it as more of a boast, personally.

&gt;Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall, they didn’t

Technically they might. Mexico is not going to write a check which says ""1 wall, please"", but they will be paying the US money in the form of trade/tariffs. Who is to say that money isn't the ""Wall money""? Money is fungible.

&gt;he had a plan to make Mexico pay that didn’t pan out because he has no idea how the world works. 

LOL I don't think he had ""a plan"". What was his plan?

&gt;He had 2 years of republican control to get the job done, but didn’t.

False. He tried to get it done while the Republicans still had control. Senate Democrats blocked him with the filibuster, which is what caused this shutdown. Republican ""control"" was not real control, since the Democrats retained filibuster power. 

Now that the Democrats control the House, they do not need to rely solely on the filibuster anymore. That is the only change.

&gt;This is a political stunt designed to further drive division between political parties and their followers.

No it is not. Trump really wants the Wall, he isn't faking it. If the Democrats were willing to give him just PART of the wall funding, the shutdown would be over. The Democrats don't want to, though, because their policy platform these days is ""Fuck Trump"", a VERY popular platform with Reddit.

&gt;He could have had his wall half built by now if it was seriously about the wall. 

Umm, no? The Wall doesn't get built that quickly. Hundreds of miles of wall already exist. Trump wants to expand that. It will take years.

&gt;He waited till now so that he could use the wall as a literal metaphor to continue destabilising the countries political landscape in the hope of securing his future reelection ...

If you believe this, then give him the money and thwart his supposed agenda. Of course you don't believe this.

At worst, Trump is forcing this standoff to prove to his base that he tried and fought for the Wall, so they won't hold it against him if he doesn't get it in the end, he can blame the democrats."

Also FYI Reagan gave amnesty in exchange for strict border security.

And only a fraud would compare a shining city on a hill as the musing of an open border lover.

Free trade has nothing to do with immigration.

FYI Trump is pro free trade. Which is why he signed a new free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.

131,I’m with you lynx. There’s no point arguing with these morons. The majority of reddit loves to silence and ignore the queer community.
