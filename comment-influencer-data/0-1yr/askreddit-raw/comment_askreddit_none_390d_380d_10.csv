Edit: I should have clarified that not all insects are exempt from death. Infestations and insects that carry diseases get no mercy."

I took it up, but left my tray (almost full drink/fries) on my table.

It took a few minutes for them to make the correct one, but it was all good.

Except someone had cleaned up.  My tray was gone.  My drink was gone.  My fries were gone.

Luckily the security guy quickly realized what he'd done, came forward about it, and I got a new drink and fries too.

I will clean up after myself.  Please don't do it for me =P"

22,"So I am American and I was in Amsterdam doing Amsterdam things about 10 years ago. My buddy and I had saved 20k a piece to do a eurotrip and we only had two weeks due to work. So we had a friggen blast, I have so many good stories from those two weeks. 

So we are in the redlight district and I see a guy coming out of a door and a girl in the entryway and the girl was smoking hot, she flipped a sign inside saying she was available as the dude walked off. I told my buddy to hang out for a few and he just laughed. So I walked in and smiled and she shut he door. Luckily she had a few standards so she helped me put a condom on. So we are going at it, great ass, nice smile, perfect tits, and I am having a blast. Then I was like, how much for anal? She was not interested so I kept raising the price. Finally she caved and I got my way. Turns out I preferred pussy that night so I went ass to vagina. I noticed after a while things were feeling amazing and I was able to get off. I pulled out and saw the condom had busted and was like oh shit. She didn‚Äôt seem bothered, like she was more relieved that I finally was able to get off so it could be over. She cleaned up the area a bit and started to push me out the door. Some other dude walked in about 2 mins after me. I was high, drunk, and horny so there were things I did not think about til later. Like that there was no running water in her room and I walked in right after a dude and I have no clue how or if she even cleaned up.  She wasn‚Äôt too worried my condom broke and she was obviously very popular so she had a lot of traffic. I told my buddy what had happened and we both knew I had probably just contracted herpagonasyphilitus. I was sick to my stomach every time I thought about it until I got checked out at the doctor about 3 weeks later.  The good news? No STDs, no fucking clue how though. "
23,You're so brave for coming out and saying what everyone's thinking

26,"Minister actually talked to me about this one time. A couple he was marrying had a woman stand up at lightning speed and object to the whole thing because she was in love with the groom. He looked at the couple and said, ""And what do you choose to do?"" He knew they really loved each other and it was painfully stupid what was happening to them. Groom said, ""She wasn't invited and I don't want anyone else but my wife."" Minister then said, ""Please have that young woman removed"" and members of both families proudly escorted her out and made sure she couldn't come back in. Hell yeah."
27,Jesus Christ. 
28,"I also hemmoraged with my first child. I didn't realize what was going on though. I just remember wondering why everyone was yelling and then feeling like I was fading out. Everything just got more and more quiet and dim. It was very peaceful. Looking back I am sure it absolute chaos in that room but I was only vaguely aware of it. I do remember a nurse got up on my bed and put all her weight on my abdomen trying to massage my uterus down. I recall thinking she's bothering me and I wish she would stop so I can go to sleep. 

You're right about that recovery. It was terrible. I was so tired for the longest time. I couldn't even lift my baby. I also look like a ghost in her newborn pictures because I was so pale from all the blood loss. "

31,"Almost ODing, I was feeling my body slowly get comfortably warm and I had a calm feeling. I was with a man I barely knew. I remember thinking that I hope he won‚Äôt get blamed for me dying and i should try to write down it wasn‚Äôt his fault. I didn‚Äôt think about family or friends like you‚Äôd think. Just that I don‚Äôt want to be a burden, and I hope no one blames themselves for what i did. 

On a lighter note, turned out that man was very sweet and he made me vomit everything up and held my hand as I became better. About a year later and we‚Äôre moving in together :) "
32,"Not my SO, but my sort of sister (we have the same half sister, but our parents are no longer together.

We went to Hawaii together after I graduated high school (so she was probably just starting). We shared a room (our parents had one, and her other siblings shared the other). I woke up one night to her yelling ‚ÄúNO!!!!‚Äù And then letting out the loudest, most disgusting fart. 

She was asleep the entire time, so she doesn‚Äôt remember it at all. "

I hope my kids never meet them. I hope I forget them. 

Its been seared into my brain and the past few months I've been really coming to terms with the effect it had on my life and how I want to move on. Who I am as an adult feels like an urgent puzzle as I'm edging closer to 30. Like my identity is going to be like a shrink-wrapped rubix cube and permanent on that barely ominous day and I have to deal with this blood born bullshit before the deadline. 

My subconscious must really want me to talk about this. Commenting here is the most I've talked about it outside of telling my partner."

40,"1) You used to go online to get away from the real world, now it's the opposite

2) Everything was so raw, unfiltered. Web since like 2007 has become so much more tame and policed. It became more user friendly. Gone were the days of sketch websites with popups that practically forced you to download a virus. I kind of miss it.

3) Speaking of virus, Napster. Napster was a cry that we wanted streaming music, much like we have today. It would be ignored for so long. But god damn ever try to get music for offline use? Like pulling teeth these days. Napster? One song sniping. But it was going to be a lot of sniping if you wanted the whole album. Torrents? Yeah shotgun effect. 

4) MSN/AIM/ICQ was the social media. It was even better if you had a shitty webcam. "

47,Reactive attachment disorder. There‚Äôs two ‚Äútypes‚Äù as you say. The super extra affectionate or the extra detached. No bond with humanity as a whole.

The application of the rhinestones to the veil however, can be incredibly labour intensive. "
53,I also saw the Austin McConnell video.
54,"The other thing is the '___ experience required' hurdle. There's a shitty habit of fresh grads getting jobs just so they can get all their training and certifications paid for, and then they immediately jump ship with all their certs leaving the company who invested in them with nothing. Then a new kid comes by and complains that nobody will hire him - yeah go ask your peers why that is.

Some companies have begun experimenting with 'group certification', which means when you leave the company they won't qualify your certifications."
55,"To be fair the arresting officer‚Äôs idea (and pretty much the extent of their ability) of ‚Äúhelping out‚Äù is maybe writing something just *slightly* less damning in a report in the hopes that the eventual prosecutor won‚Äôt go ham.

They said ""you can talk to our lawyer"" I said ""Great! What's his number?"" They had their lawyer call me, he yelled at me on the phone for a while, offered the security deposit back, screamed (direct quote) ""Are you not whole!?"" (which is lawyer-speak for ""we don't think you're morally entitled to anything, even though you legally are"")

I said I'd see them in small claims court, sent them a letter outlining my claim for triple damages (which state law dictates in these cases) and letting them know I'd file with small claims court on the first of the month. The day before I was all prepared to get a court date, they called and sent a check for three times the amount of the security deposit.

Seriously, it's super easy. Even going to small claims court (which I've done before) is only $50 to file and you can do it on your lunch break."

79,"So my sister was sent to the one in Montana because at thirteen, she told my biological birthing unit that she was gay.  That didn't sit too well with the Christian lady.

No rainbows and smiley faces drawn or you were banned from sending/receiving letters.  Anderson Cooper did an investigation into that particular camp shortly after she left and found tons of abuse and sexual assault going on.  Didn't matter to that bitch of a mother we had, E had to stay in the camp until she was seventeen, almost eighteen.  She's not been the same since.  She's so fucked up now it breaks my heart.

82,"Oh wow I can actually contribute to this - 

I worked as a bartender at a decently large venue bar that did weddings on one end, and music and live shows on the other. Very often on the summer weekends there would be a wedding happening on one side and a separate band on the other, all of the bartenders ran both at the same time. 

During one of these weekends, while both events were going on, the drunk groom stumbled over from the wedding area to order from the main bar (on the music venue side) and ended up using the bathrooms on that side. I guess he found his newly married, equally trashed bride giving a blowjob to one of the band members in one of the stalls. All I remember is seeing the bride run out and scream ""HELP!"" and a bunch of us ran in the bathroom. The whole thing was a mess, paper towels everywhere, a mirror was broken, the stall door was partly unhinged, and there was blood on the ground - all with the groom on top of the band member in the middle of the floor, just absolutely DESTROYING his face with punches. We managed to separate them and called an ambulance as well as the police.

That was the wildest it ever got. "
83,"Probably gonna be buried, but here we go:

I went to my wife's sister's wedding.  Wife's sister married a woman.  Her embracing of her sexual orientation coincided with my FIL embracing hardcore southern Baptist style Christianity.

Ceremony goes off fine.  At the reception, which FIL paid for, he takes the mic when it's time for a speech.  He had been drinking.

His speech begins by talking about what a lovely daughter he has, how lucky he is, etc.  

The speech then took a horrible turn, and he starts talking about his daughter's new wife turning his daughter ""To the dark side.""  He claims that the male marine his daughter dated prior to the relationship with her new bride was the relationship she should have stuck with, and that he didn't understand how she could turn her back on God this way.  He then said something unspeakable about the anatomical difference between the marine and his daughter's wife, and took a shot of Fireball, and then another.  

He threw up later.  He claims he doesn't remember a bit of it. "

In the novel he poetically uses the Elder Wand for exactly one spell: He uses *Reparo*, the mending/fixing spell on his own broken wand, then places it back into Dumbledore's tomb so that the power of the Elder Wand dies with him. In the movie he straight breaks in in half and tosses it in the river.

Now the movies skipped out on a lot, for example in The Half Blood Prince we only see Tom Riddle as a young orphan, and his tampered Horcrux memory, meanwhile the book really focuses on his background. It made Voldemort a more complete character, but I get why you'd only leave the bits that were of the utmost importance. I had also been mad they left out the entirety of *The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore*, but that was before I knew they were making it a five part movie franchise in its own right.

What I don't get is why they changed that ending portion. It surprised me a bit, because I wasn't expecting them to mess with perfection."

Nope, she still DEMANDED it. We were like ok \*dialing\*. Ten minutes later, the ambulance came. Guess what? EMTs yelled at the princess resident for waste their valuable time and told her they would NOT take her and would bill her.

However, she then decided to wipe said poopy asshole all over the floor, which I didn't initially notice because I have wood floors so the colour was pretty similar, so I trod, barefoot, in a puddle of what I could best describe as diarrhoea precum. Still with the same stench that was somewhat comparable to her expelling an entire decomposing corpse from her asshole.

I went to a concert and met a couple. I hung out with them all evening but we didn't really talk about ourselves. I added them in hope of attending a different show with my new-found friends. Before more shows occur, the girl tells me they broke up and complained how everyone is always leaving her and how she's been physically abused by her mother and sexually abused by a lot of guys. I ended up deleting her off of FB. I kept the guy though. He's pretty chill.

The other occasion was actually a week or two after Fourth of July. I went with some friends to eat downtown and this particular area is rife with homeless people with bad drug problems and/or mental illness. A lady came up to us and asked for money for her medications because she has HIV and schizephrenia and needed her meds. Pretty sure she was planning to use the money for illicit drugs but I thought giving her a few bucks would make her go away. Instead, she proceeded to introduce herself and tell us she can tell when people have demons in them and if it weren't for the fact that our voices were so calming she would have pulled out a gun and shot all of us. I made sure to act extra nice at that point until we could safely head to the metro stop in the opposite direction."

For example, they don't offer a simplified language requirement for engineers, but they offer a simplified physics requirement for language majors. Someone working on an engineering degree likely has more important classes to focus on than Spanish like Thermo.

336,"&gt; ""Tell me about a time you made a mistake and how you handled it?""

As annoying as this quesiton is for an interviewee, I love it as an interviewer. I often only ask, ""Tell me about a time you made a mistake,"" then follow up if needed (stronger interview candidate won't need the follow-up, typically). When I ask this question, I'm looking for three things:

- Can you actually admit you make mistakes? Many people fail at this stage; they provide a story of a 'mistake' that is not really a mistake at all. They might also compound this with failing to explain  how they resolved the mistake because it was not really a mistake or their fault, so there is no option for them to show how they fixed the situation. Even worse, it might show the person stepping on toes or being a terrible team player to correct other's mistakes, etc.

- Does your mistake freak me out? Am I worried you're going to burn down the place on your first day here? I realize this seems like an unfair tightrope to walk (need to show the interviewer a 'real' mistake but probably not the worst thing you've ever done in your life, etc.). But that also signals judgment in a professional environment and how you interact with people; do you understand how to deliver what's needed?

- How did you rectify the situation and what did you learn (possibly two things, so four total?). In essence, what's the moral of the story for you that makes you an even better person to hire today? Some people require follow-up on this, and it can still be a great answer if they need slight prompting. Part of the problem here is an interviewee who has never considered this question because they might choose a mistake (in a panic during the few seconds after interviewer asks the question) that does not have a moral of the story. A nice interviewer might ask about another mistake that has shaped the interviewee as a person/employee/professional today, signaling to the interviewee to offer another mistake (give me a better example).

Anyhow, I thought I would chime in. It sounds like your boss made the right call in that situation!"

344,"I had a kidney stone removed and stent put in. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about it and I was in more pain after the procedure than before I had the stone removed.

By day 3 I was peeing so much blood and I wasn‚Äôt eating and I just looked like death. 

Went back to hospital, got sent home. Told me it was normal. Went back in two days later, sent home again.both times they barely checked me. (I was told I must go back to the same hospital I had the surgery done if there was any complications - so why I kept going back there instead of another hospital) 

Two days later I collapsed, I actually went to my GP before going to the hospital because I wanted a second opinion. He took one look at me, ultrasounded me immediately, found I had a massive blood clot in my bladder and a couple smaller ones where my stent was. The hospital was around the corner so my ride rushed me there

He called ahead and told them off and said he will help me sue them if something happens. 

The admit me, and have the nerve to say to me why didn‚Äôt you come in earlier! I told them how they sent me home already twice. And they made me wait a couple hours for another ultrasound even though the GP has just given me one. 

I had to stay in for 2 days while they flushed out the clots. But they refused to take out the stent and said it must stay in the full two weeks. Even after they flushed out the clots I was still in extreme pain, like getting up off the bed was agonizing. I wasn‚Äôt eating still. I begged them to take the stent out. I felt like it was constantly ripping my insides. 

The nurse said to me as they discharged me that if I see any bleeding to come straight back. So I took this as they would take me seriously. 

Not even 24 hours later - bleeding again. At this point I felt like I was slowly dying. My Aunty and mom found me just lying there looking like a ghost. 

They took me straight back where I kid you not, the triage nurse basically rolled her eyes when she saw me again. They were going to send me home again!! They said it was normal! After everything that had already happened, it was like they were ignoring my file. They finally admitted me after my mom stepped in, but still wouldn‚Äôt take out the stent. The urologist would see me twice that day and I would beg him and he would just tell me to wait a couple more days. 

Anyway found a nice nurse who was concerned when she saw the blood in the pee bowl and she spoke to another urologist over the phone Who said he would take it out that afternoon. When I got there he didn‚Äôt seem have the history what had happened. Just took a look at me and how I couldn‚Äôt walk properly and took it out straight away. They use some camera so you can see them do it and while he was doing it you could see all the blood clots as he was pulling it out. 

He freaked out and said why haven‚Äôt I got this out earlier, how dangerous the clots were, etc. I told him what had happened. He was so angry and he called my original urologist to be like why did you let get that far. And then wrote me up some paper Incase I wanted to take it further. (My GP wrote a formal complaint too) 

I tell you, the moment he pulled it out and the clots came out, it was instant relief. I ended up passing a part of a stone and 3 more clots at a public restroom on the way home(that‚Äôs another story - some guy saw me on the ground crouched. And asked me if I was in labor and before I could answer he offered me some DMT then rode off) by the next evening I was walking around, eating, color back. No more bleeding. 

It was so crazy. I felt like such a burden going back to the hospital each time but I knew something was wrong even though they told me it was normal after effects of having a stent in. I don‚Äôt understand how they could think losing  the amount of blood I was losing everytime I peed was normal. They didn‚Äôt even seem to care I hadn‚Äôt eaten in days and I looked like death warmed up. 

Honestly that GP was my life saver. I went back to him after a few days to get a check up ultrasound for any blood clots but they were all gone "

348,"This one I'm really actually leaning towards being legitimate, actually. There is evidence, and even a push to have DNA analysis done on vertebrae removed during the autopsy and preserved of the alleged John Wilks Booth, compared to DNA of Edwin booth and to the body of one John St. Helen/ David George.

John St. Helen lived in Granbury, Texas for many years, appearing a few months after the assassination and worked in a theatre for many years before becoming very ill and confessing on what he thought was his death bed that he was John Wilk Booth... But he got better and disappeared.

He surfaced a little later as David George in Enid, Oklahoma and in 1903 purchased a fatal dose of poison and imbibed it and before expiring stated that he was John Wilks booth. These two instances would be unrelated except for one man requested by JWB/JStH/DG, Finis Bates who confirmed that David George was John St. Helen. Kinda wonky, right... it gets a little weirder if you look at the choice of names...

Both have connotations of named saints from Catholicism and Booth was raised in the Episcopal church and later converted to Catholicism. 

St. Helen is the patron saint of the falsely accused, in laws, and widows...
St. George is the patron saint of soldiers, England, and in some interpretations of the preservation of the state.

Booth was highly educated, and I think this could really be a case of hiding in plain sight, guilt, and a very strange form of justification of himself. Makes you think don't it? :)"
349,"I had a major issue with my eye a few years ago. Most of the nurses were amazing. I was in so much pain I‚Äôd been there about a week when they replaced the cannula in my arm for the 5th time.

So this Irish older nurse does it. ‚ÄúShort, sharp pain!‚Äù She warned. Now, my tear duct had exploded and I had cellulitis in my eye. I was in agony. Getting a cannula was *nothing* compared to that. Yet I screamed when she put it in.

Every time I moved my arm I screamed. I called her in twice telling her I think there‚Äôs a problem with it. I *knew* there was. But she didn‚Äôt listen. Didn‚Äôt care. She treated me so badly. An old man next to me dropped his blanket so I got out of bed and helped him. I picked up the blanket with my cannula arm and literally bent over in pain, screaming. The old man called the nurse in and pleaded with her. Insisted the pain wasn‚Äôt normal. She ignored him. I started crying and she ignored me.

So the next day my eye started gushing blood so they took me in for emergency surgery.

The anesthetiser gave me a relaxant and wheeled me into the OR and I‚Äôm lying there while do all the prep. After several minutes I was like ‚ÄúUh, should I be feeling sleepy yet?‚Äù.  Someone goes ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not sleepy?‚Äù Then there‚Äôs this sudden wave of activity, and the surgeon checked my cannula, I screamed when he touched it and he blurts out ‚ÄúIdiots! How long has she had this in?‚Äù and someone‚Äôs goes ‚Äú13 hours‚Äù and he goes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stuck in her muscle tissue‚Äù. 

I was told later that that is one of the most painful things that can happen and that it was insane I had lasted those 13 hours. I also hadn‚Äôt received any IV antibiotics for those 13 hours which is probably why my eye started bleeding. The infection has actually burst through my eye because there was nothing stopping it.

It might be spiteful but I really hope that nurse was punished for her incompetence.

tl;dr Nurse stuck cannula in my arm and ignored me when I kept insisting there something wrong. Turns out she has stuck it in my muscle tissue. I was without antibiotics for 13 hours because of her which caused the infection to burst through my eye. Not pretty."

I called the hospital and they explained that as it was a little difficult for my mother to give consent, they couldn't give any information out.  So I said, ""Can I give consent, as her health care proxy?"" (she had signed the paperwork before going in for the final surgery) The nurse was completely flummoxed, but went to ask.  Turns out that yes, I could.  So that's how the hospital was able to share information despite dead people being notoriously reluctant to give consent to things!"

370,"Adopted one when he was 11. Wasn‚Äôt bad. He came to my house after school with my son to stay the weekend (they are in the same grade and same age) then kind of never left. He had a weird custody/guardianship thing with one of his biological uncles and apparently he wasn‚Äôt being taken care of very well. Called his uncle after the first week and couldn‚Äôt get in contact with him, attempted to wait at his house and he never showed up, come to find out he was working in another state and left this kid to fend for himself. After a few months he was pretty much settled in and enjoying the luxuries of having a stable place to stay, hot water, food, etc.. I spoke with him about just staying with me and he got super excited so I approached the court and petitioned for guardianship/custody and when the court date rolled around it was just me, the judge and court personnel in the courtroom, nobody else showed up on the kids behalf so I was awarded him. Had a huge ‚Äúit‚Äôs a boy‚Äù dinner with all my family in attendance and he even got a pacifier, a few diapers and a bottle as gifts because my family thinks they are hilarious. My boys are 16 now and are doing great in school and are well behaved. When people ask how old my kids are I say I have 2 16 year olds and a 6 year old. When questioned about the 16 year olds I just say they‚Äôre twins. I also have another one of their friends who is also 16 that started coming around the house when he was 12 and before high school he stayed like the whole summer at my house and then went back to his mother before school started and would come over on the weekends and after the first semester of school he approached me and asked to stay because he was getting frustrated with bouncing around to different homes with his mom. I couldn‚Äôt say no so I spoke with his mom and told her it would be ok and it would make her life easier while she got on her feet so now I have triplets, all 16.

436,"It's pretty typical for most people to respond saying something along the lines of ""you'll get past it"" in some form or another. I won't do that. 

I understand exactly where you're coming from. There's this great scene in Mystic River where one of the characters-- a young man-- is talking about the loss of his girlfriend. He says ""I loved her so much. I'm never gonna feel that again. It doesn't happen twice."" The older character-- going through his own problems with his marriage-- responds with ""Doesn't happen once most times.""

I think there's a great deal of truth to that. Not everyone gets to experience a love like that. I, just like you, am dealing with my own heartbreak-- and worse yet, I'm the one who did wrong. I used to make fun of people who said ""when I first saw her I knew"" or ""when you know, you know."" I thought they were naive and ill-informed on what love really is. But you're right, sometimes you meet someone and it just hits you: she's the one. And nothing anyone says or does could possibly make you feel like that isn't true. 

The reality is, which many people seem to forget, that not all stories have happy endings. It doesn't always work out for everyone. And not everyone can forgive themselves for the things they've done. And that's just the way it is sometimes. 

At the end of the day, I am not waiting for her to come back. I am always going to love her, and there's nothing wrong with meaning it when you say you'll love someone forever-- despite what some people in this thread will try to tell you. I do think it's possible that we may find each other again, but in the meantime I'm just trying to be the best man I can be and live the kind of life that she would actually want to be a part of should she ever reach back out. I would say you should try that as well, if you can manage it. And if you're just too heartbroken to even consider that idea, that's okay. 

When everything is all said and done, the feeling that stays with me ultimately is immeasurable gratitude. I feel so privileged to have felt something so real and profound and beautiful-- and to have been loved back just the same. I'm grateful for just knowing her. 

I hope this helped, my friend. "

473,"&gt; what bureaucracy leads to when managers aren't competent and chains of communication are obscured

And yet they still didn't learn these lessons for the Columbia disaster. It was known that foam from the external tank fell off and sometimes damaged tiles on the orbiter but management had just accepted it as it hadn't caused a serious problem, yet. They just sort of assumed the orbiter wasn't going fast enough near lift off for it to be much of an issue and let the problem continue for years.

Then when film of Columbia lifting off showed an extremely large piece of foam striking a wing NASA was worried but the crew couldn't see it from any windows on the shuttle and they weren't equipped to do an EVA to go outside and check. NASA managers also thought that no US spy satellites would have the resolution to image the orbiter wing in enough detail to see any damage so they never asked. The problem is the satellites *would have been able to image it in enough detail* but the NASA manager who made the decision not to even ask the military to try hadn't kept updated on their new security clearances they got with a recent promotion. They made the decision based on incomplete information and had no idea their new job with the higher clearance level entitled them know the updated specs of the satellites which was high enough to be useful in seeing the damage.

So they never asked for help and Columbia tried to re-enter the atmosphere with a massive hole in the leading edge of the wing which led to the loss of vehicle and the entire crew as well. How they might have rescued the crew in orbit is a matter of debate but at least they would have known trying to re-enter was a death sentence and attempted a rescue.

The sad thing is both Challenger and Columbia were avoidable if competent management was in place. And for the lack of it 14 people died.

482,"any time a lil kid poops at the pool I go to we're all kicked out for 45 minutes.  It usually happens in the separated 8-and-under area aka kiddy pool, but it's still true.

Also chlorine is not doled out in ""scoops.""  and chlorine does not act alone in the pool. Not in a public or commercial pool, anyway.  You might in your home, but in any other case it's done with the active filtration and cleaning system.  You're thinking of a more passive system.

 Chlorine bonds to the organic stuff, together becoming a type of ""chloramine.""  Then, another chemical has to be added which bonds with the chloramine in an oxidation/reduction gas-forming reaction.  The chlorine, bacteria, and shocking chemical amalgum molecules evaporate.  This is called shocking the water, and it is what you smell when you think a pool as too much chlorine.  It's actually the smell of the pool getting cleaner in that moment. 

If you go to a public swimming pool, you should be able to find some housing somewhere where the active system is working.  The typical american swimming pool has these gutters where water is gravitationally fed into this system, which will treat the water first by filtering out large solid particles, then shock, re-chlorinate, and return the water into the pool.  This includes adding new water and chlorine to take into account evaporation and people taking water with them out of the pool.  Those finger-sized jets near the top of the water or those weird plates at the bottom of the pool?  that's the fresh, good stuff."

There was a movement in Western Australia to reinstate the death penalty purely so Arthurs could receive a death sentence but it ultimately failed.

If the person did anything worthwhile with their career they likely had outsized responsibility compared to other people their age. For example, not too many jobs have 19 year olds signing off final inspections on $50 million dollar pieces of equipment keeping multiple people alive after 6 months of training, or managing 7 or 8 figure budgets with a high school diploma and a year of OJT.

665,"Adopted a 5yo and a 3yo. 

Bio mom was 12 when she had the first, 15 when she had the second. We got them out of foster care after the state had already terminated parental rights. 

Two years later, bio got pregnant with her third. We got the phone call to come get him when he was a year and a half. 

The oldest is fantastic. She‚Äôs 13 now. No problems. When we got her, she would throw fits, and we found out real quick that if we just shut the door to her room, she‚Äôd fizzle out. The middle kid is 11 now, and he‚Äôs trouble. My wife and I both teach, and she‚Äôs at a national blue ribbon school. We had to take him out of that school this year and he‚Äôs with me now. Drugs were a part of the pregnancy, and he‚Äôs on medication now to help level him out. He‚Äôs not overly defiant, but has trouble respecting women, including my wife. 

The youngest had no clue he was adopted until about six months ago. He‚Äôs 6 now. He was a drug baby also, and he was left alone a lot as an infant, so we‚Äôve had some trouble with him also. He‚Äôs also on medication. But he is absolutely the most loving of the three. He can also be the biggest pain in our ass. 

The differences in the two we got who were older and the one we got as a toddler are that the middle boy still maintains an odd sort of loyalty to the bio mom (who isn‚Äôt in the picture for them other than the odd Christmas and birthday gift, although my wife sends her pictures), and would often say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my real mom,‚Äù to my wife. That hurt, but he‚Äôs stopped taking it that far at least. 

The oldest girl wants nothing to do with the bio mom. Can‚Äôt stand talking about her. Discarded the Christmas gifts she sent. 

Youngest has some sympathy for the bio mom because we have told him that she was in trouble and had to give him to us because we had his brother and sister. However, that sense of loyalty to the bio mom isn‚Äôt there. 

For a surprise ending to this story, after trying for thirteen years, my wife got pregnant a couple of years ago and we now have a a year and three month old (don‚Äôt give me that 15 months shit). All three of the adopted kids love him more than they love each other.

Not the happiest there's pain and disappointment but its the deepest you can go.I worked with my dad for decades and really love him dearly and now that I work with guys who are 25 yrs younger then me I wish to god they were my own flesh and blood. I know I'd have been a great dad but Mrs wrong was always my girlfriend and 1 wife. I have so much to give but its too late for me. You can't be 72 and arguing with your daughter that she's not going out dressed like that Saskia! I really think you have to know who you are what your real philosophy of life is to be successful in raising kids. Helicopter parents are the worst. You need to be firm but you can't trample their creativity. Parents I see think they know better but are clueless. Not all mind you but so many. You have to have strong character raising young uns . The problem I see with parents is not knowing why you are disciplining your kids. Basically they're selfish and still kids themselves. Its so incredibly sad. I actually cried the other day telling my friends about how I missed having kids. I just started talking about it and all of a sudden I was breaking up.

Stewardess asks people to move up and one guy volunteers. She gives the whole shpeel about needing to help in the event of an accident and he agrees. Well, as we're making our final descent for landing this guy starts having a full blown panic attack, hyperventilating, grabbing his head, rocking back and forth. When the stewardess walks by to go back to her seat for landing he stops mid panic attack and acts perfectly normal. Then once she passed he goes back to freaking out. Yeah that guy would have been useless in an emergency. "

Said it was the most common thing he dealt with in regards to turning people down for firearms. Although the one that took the cake according to him was a customer who came in and bought a normal glock 17 and some ammo. Guy passed the checks, wasn't sketchy, was a common gun for him to sell as he'd get a bunch of used ones and advertised them a lot. 

About 15 minutes later a bunch of police and fire trucks show up, and officer comes in asking if they had just sold a gun to that guy and he said yeah why.

780,"My sister died last year of a brain tumor.  I don't know how her husband knew something was wrong.  They gave her about a year said they couldn't operate. I went to see her and she seemed fine. Then three weeks later we got a call to come see her. They gave her chemo and the drugs took the life out of her limbs and she could no longer use them.  So the family said no more chemo and at first even though she couldn't walk or use her arms she still could talk etc.  Three days later she lost her speech.  All she could do is follow you with her eyes around the room.   The next day she no longer followed you around.  The day she died she came back to life and talked to everyone for about 20-30 minutes (it seemed that long) and then she was gone again, and she died that evening last September with family and friends. 

Another family member she was the opposite of my sister.  They chased her down the hallway in her hospital gown  several times.  She was all over the bed and came close to hurting herself several times.  At times she seemed to be aggressive.  She was very active in speech and physically.  Until a day and a half or so before she passed. 

Both didn't live as long as the doctors said they would.    

I am only bringing this case up because it just shows how our brain works.  Years ago a mans house was broken into.  They thought he had money.  They beat that man very very bad in the head and back regions.  The two suspects left the man on the floor of his bedroom.  They took off.  Hours later the  beaten man came to and got up off the floor went and made coffee, got his newspaper and did all his other morning routine then died in his living room.  
The cops couldn't figure out what happen because the blood was everywhere but in three major areas.  bedroom, front door, and living room.  The autopsy helped to solve it.  When they beat him so bad they beat his head in in the areas of the brain that regulate ""reason""   ""pain"" and the other was danger or the get help.  He died because he didn't know something was wrong with himself. He bled out.  

We just don't realize what all our brain does for us on a daily basis. "

Obviously, potential spoilers:

The opening shot of the movie is a pile of identical top hats and the voice over says ""are you watching closely?"" Basically giving away every twist.

When he's married she says that some days when he said ""I love you"" she can tell that he means it and some days he doesn't. Another hint.

After Hugh Jackman's wife dies he asks Bale what knot he tied, and he legitimately doesn't know. He says he doesn't remember and Jackman asks ""how could you not know?"" Well... then we find out. 

When they're trying to figure out how the Chinese magician does his trick Christian Bale spots it right away. He is LIVING A LIE to sell the trick. 

When Jackman is trying to figure out how Bale does The Transported Man everyone tells him ""He's using a double."" They literally say it out loud, but the audience is seeing it through Jackman's perspective so we don't really hear it.

Then there's the name of the movie. The Prestige. Has Michael Caine explains it somewhere near the beginning: ""making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back"" it's the whole twist right there.

But the biggest one is when Christian Bale is acting as an assistant to the inferior magician in the beginning. The magician does a trick where he makes a bird disappear and reappear. A little kid starts crying because the bird died but Bale shows him the bird and says ""no, he's right here"" the crying kid says ""No; that's his brother!"" And Bale then takes the trick back stage and reveals to the audience that there were in fact two birds, and the original was killed as part of the trick. 

People say that Inception is Chris Nolan's movie about how much he loves moviemaking, but it's not: The Prestige is. The whole movie is about how movies are magical- these crazy magic tricks. Everyone knows they're not real, but we go anyway because (as Michael Caine says) ""We want to be fooled."""

Had I been in a better place with my mother (Still not, over 30 years later), I would have moved back with them to get away.

Also OP remember that you don't always need to wear the jacket. In many cases it's perfectly acceptable to take the jacket off and hang it up or put it on the back of your chair.

**EDIT**
another option is to wear a vest instead of the jacket. It's slightly less formal than the jacket, but you can roll up your sleeves and still look good in a vest Examples [here](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/6d/c6/2c/6dc62cbece9aedbe1538a396b4865f12--groomsman-attire-groomsmen-suits.jpg) and [here](https://www-static.weddingbee.com/pics/302970/image2.jpg) if you want to go more formal later when it cools down, you can pop the jacket back on and it's a 3 piece suit."

I turned around and there was a black proofreader, who I didn't know as well, looking like I had just kicked her dog.
I felt bad. Asked Louis about it. He said if you think she was upset about it, just ask her.

1103,"I had a friend back in college. Let's call her ""Amy"". Amy was beautiful, smart, popular... and also had a raging case of bipolar disorder. Normally it was controlled under medication, but Amy would take herself off her meds for the hell of it and self-medicate with cocaine. And when she does cocaine, Amy becomes an aggressive, rude, hyperactive nightmare who gives no thought to other people's feelings.

Amy was friends with the guys on the rugby team and spent a lot of time at their apartment. She loved the male attention. One time, she got into a fight with her boyfriend and went over to the rugby house and fucked one of the guys on the team (let's call him Mike). Mike had a long-term girlfriend (let's call her Sarah) who also went to our school, and Amy was completely aware of this at the time. She also knew Sarah personally and was friendly with her.

In the days after, I saw how Amy justified cheating on her boyfriend and how she had the audacity to continue her friendship with Sarah. I'd watch Amy at parties, telling Sarah what a cute outfit she was wearing and how nice her new haircut looked, knowing that Amy had just fucked her boyfriend. It made me sick. Sarah had no idea, but Amy wasn't the only girl Mike cheated on her with. 

Eventually, Sarah found out about the other girls and went running to Amy (!!!!) for comfort. Instead of confessing her own transgressions with Mike,  Amy encouraged Sarah to vent to her about the situation. Sarah ended up opening up to Amy about all this personal stuff that went on in her relationship with Mike and how heartbroken she was about the infidelity, having no idea that Amy was one of the ""other women"" the entire time. Honestly, I think Amy got some perverse pleasure out of the whole thing. 

At the time, I didn't say anything because I was flabbergasted that Amy would do such a messed up thing. The most bizarre thing to me was that not once did Amy address the fact that what she was doing was clearly wrong. That day, I started viewing her differently. I lost all respect for her. For awhile, I struggled with guilt over leaving the friendship because Amy obviously needs some serious therapy, but at the end of the day that's not my problem when someone is so toxic. 

Last I heard, Amy continues to get into constant trouble and has pushed away the majority of her friends due to behavior like this. I think back on other things she's done and her blatant disregard for other people's feelings and emotions, and quite frankly, none of it surprises me. She was a grimy human being. "

1128,"When I lived in Australia I was fascinated by the stars there. Also the women. But the stars were so amazing if you could get away from the cities. I worked at a chicken factory and there was a bunch of us university students that all hung out and tried to not breathe in the poisonous fumes.

One weekend a beautiful Australian college girl named Anna and her sister Maggie in our group invited me and the other guys to help Anna celebrate her 21st birthday at her family's home farm. We said yes of course, I try to think of life like improv- its yes and. So we all got in this old ute and drove from our home in Newcastle, Australia to the outback.

When we got to her family's farm her brother was a cloud of dust flying by on his motorcycle with a golf club wildly swinging at and killing kangaroos (guns are illegal there so you have to hire shooters to kill all the kangaroos on your farm).

That next day was her party and what I saw took drinking to a new level- they passed around a boot and everyone dumped whatever liquor they were drinking into the boot. This was her brothers disgusting full size cowboy boot and people were pouring in Vodka, Rum, Tooheys New, Victoria Bitter, even whiskey into it. When it got back up to the front the crowd started singing loudly,

""Heres to Anna she's True Blue,

Sheeees a pissssspot through and through,

She's a bastard so they say,

TRIED TO DRINK IT DOWN BUT IT WENT THE OTHER WAY!""

SI----IIIIP, SI-IIIIIP, DRINK DRINK DRINK!""

That champ just skulled that whole boot full of trashcan punch, man she downed it! Needless to say we were all pretty drunk pretty quickly. There weren't enough beds or couches or anything, people just grabbed a blanket and went out into the middle of the yard.

I saw so many stars that night, the Southern Cross, it was beautiful way out there in the Outback away from the city lights. And the falling stars, I saw so many, I couldnt even follow them all. Well I tried to follow but I was also getting a blowjob from Maggie so it made it more challenging."

He's high maintenance and rude, and at the end of the evening he leaves a tip of zero. His justification: I pay their salary, why should I tip? Never mind the fact that you've taken away all of the other potential sources of income that evening. As a server you'd be better off taking a night off work.

Especially with the private detective digging up the backyard of their old house for his body at the end of the film. 

I think he never came forward with it because it was something he made up after he got caught. The sister made a good point at the end of the documentary, she that if they killed Nicholas why would they take in this guy to cover it up. No one was investigating, no one thought it was a murder, he was treated as a runaway and they were the only people searching for him. Taking him in only brought attention to the case. The only thing that gets me is that they didn't do DNA sooner. He was actually claimed by another family of a missing kid but police wouldn't let him go with them until they did a DNA test to confirm it. "

I also have family members who have been raped, and it's really fucked them up, especially the reactions of people who should be there for them questioning and deriding them on account of the inconvenience.

1282,"These are my rules to avoid insomnia.

1. Stick to your sleep schedule. I try to wake up and be out of bed before 9am every day. If something happens that keeps me out or up late the night before I still have to get up at 8-8:30am. No matter how tired I am. This is the only way to keep my sleep schedule from going to to that 4am - 1pm stuff.

2. Be in bed around the same time every night. For me this is 9-10pm and asleep around 11-12. Try to avoid being in bed during the afternoon to train your body that bed = sleep. I don‚Äôt really have any other furniture so it makes me find other things to do - go to cafes and read, go outside, play with my pets, etc. 

3. I avoid caffeine and alcohol. I‚Äôm not saying you have to do this but just that it‚Äôs probably a huge part of why I don‚Äôt have trouble sleeping.

4. Exercise. I exercise almost daily from anywhere from 30 min - 4 hours however.... I don‚Äôt think this is by any means necessary, again, just helpful and something I enjoy doing. If I‚Äôm not sleeping well my last ditch effort is to run like hell. Exercise until I‚Äôm exhausted and either that night or the next I‚Äôll sleep like a baby. 

5. My last trick is, if I‚Äôve been in bed staring at the ceiling for hours and I‚Äôm just not falling asleep, block all access to clocks, and try not to stress about how little sleep I‚Äôm getting before work or whatever the next day. Maybe open a book and turn on some real low level light and read until my eyes get heavy. Really trying not to worry about not sleeping and just letting my body tell me when it‚Äôs tired."

1345,"So not exactly a disqualification story, but it almost did.  

I once received a resume for an entry level position that was on its face, relatively mediocre.  It listed small short term jobs, limited education and no experience in related fields, I was about to chuck it in my ‚Äòrainy day‚Äô pile when I noticed something in the ‚Äúadditional skills section‚Äù.  It listed the normal: ‚ÄúMicrosoft word, excel, power point...‚Äù and then it listed ‚Äúand I‚Äôm pretty good a beat boxing‚Äù  I immediately called my supervisor (who was about my same age and a chill boss) and proceeded to read him the resume including his unique skills list.  He concurred with me that we needed to co-interview this guy if only to see this skill.

So I call up his references ( whom all sang his praises like they wanted him to be their biological son) and set up the interview.  Have interview.  He does well.  Call boss in room.  Lean forward in chairs.  Tell him we saw his listed skills and that we want him to prove his abilities.  Guy briefly hesitates,  then busts out a crazy fast multi-layered beat.  Fake synth noises from his nasal cavity, muting and echoing with his hands, throat noises for base beat, all done in just about 10 seconds of a wall of sound.

Hired the mofo on the spot (he already had the job anyway).  He ends up being one of our best employees.  I‚Äôve since moved on, but I went back recently for a little freelance work and the kid is still there and has been promoted several times.

Lesson learned: If you want a good employee, don‚Äôt shy away from strange.

One night, I'm 3/4s asleep when my husband let rip an earthquake of a fart. I felt it on my back, it was that bad. What's more is it was stupidly loud- because I was falling completely asleep, it startled me awake.

Mom would hand me off to anyone she could, but only when she even noticed I was even around. She was/is a broken, violent person.

To explain, I work in a manufacturing plant in the south US.  Not my home, but i grew up a few hundred miles away in the south around similar people.  One day, I was in the QC lab looking into some things.  Two older white women there started to bring up a female coworker from another shift.  She had some problems.  Her teenage son had just committed suicide, which I guess the mother confided to these women that I was in the presence of.  Not verbatim, but here‚Äôs what I heard them say:  

‚ÄúPoor girl, she‚Äôs crazy enough as it is anyway‚Äù [laughter].... ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never kill myself, I‚Äôm not stupid enough to go to hell‚Äù [laughter]... some words were exchanged about suicide.  Woman A said she‚Äôd probably take pills and just go to sleep if she was going to do it.  Woman B said ‚Äú I‚Äôd just blow my brains out with a shotgun, quick and easy.‚Äù  I asked if she‚Äôd really want to leave such a gruesome mess for her loved ones to find? (I knew someone from school a few years older than me who did that to his parents, because he was failing a class taught by a dried up old cunt.).  Woman B responds: ‚Äú of course! If I‚Äôm going to do that , I really don‚Äôt give a shit about anyone but myself!‚Äù... Boy, did she miss the fucking mark.  I was ready to slug this cunt in the face.  I had to leave.

Or was it that your parents had a son but didn't get married until he was 3 years old? And since your oldest brother is a bastard child, most of your family rejected him? But then they accepted the rest of the children born after your parents were married? 

Either way, the people who rejected your brother from being part of their family are horrible. 

Even if he isn't their blood, he's still your father's son, and they should love him the same. Would they reject a child adopted by a married couple?

It's not just ""one fan"" telling him thanks. It's dozen, or more, every time he's somewhere outside. It's every 20 feet that someone interrupts him.

Like, great, as an isolated instance, someone coming up to you to thank you and telling you you're cool can't possibly be interpreted as a bad thing. But that's from the POV of the person doing it. From the POV of the person on the receiving end, being Thom Yorke, it has to be absolute hell 6 months in.

Also, not being an asshole, or just being friendly *invites people to further interaction*. Maybe the guy in this OP wasn't going to do that, but I'm sure you can imagine how crazy some of these fans get. Being short is probably far more healthy for him.

Do you play video games?

Imagine every night going home, logging on to psn/Xbox live/steam and playing games with your friends. You do this everyday. The only time you ever feel happy is when you are playing games with your friends. Eventually you have to stop playing games.

You no longer talk to those friends.

You are not allowed near any gaming computer or colsole. Your identity in those years was a gamer, it was your life, it dictated who your friends were. You lived ever day of your life just to afford the latest games. Now you are thrown into the real world but due to you having wasted those years as a gamer you are far behind everyone else at starting being an adult, and everyone who knows you used to game looks down on you, unless they try to act proud of you for stopping.

Everytime you walk past game stop or the Walmart electronics area you get a twinge in your heart of wanting to go back to just being happy playing games with your friends. You know you can just go get a few cheap games and relive that feeling but you know you shouldn't. Your life is not great but you know it's better than it was when you were a gamer. You now have money to buy dinner since you don't spend your paycheck on games but it's not the same as when you would stay up all night playing games with your friends.

Now replace games in that with heroin or alcohol or meth or whatever drug was your choice and that is basically what it feels like to be clean for a long time ...at least in my experience. "

I think subconsciously, there was a part of me that was saying ""well, if I can't successfully break up with her, maybe I can force the issue and she'll break up with me.""

I was like, first off all there's nothing wrong with that, and second of all, I said he's NOT attractive.

His argument was that I shouldn't even see men as attractive or unattractive at all, because we're both guys.

Our argument went further than that but those were the main points. He basically said it was black culture (he's black, I am not and grew up in an area without a lot of diversity, so he'll tell me about how he grew up and things like that) and that guys don't even smile at each other because it shows weakness.

1541,"Major night owl here who got a morning job about a year ago. I could go on and on about what I miss about being up at night. I like my job, which is a first for me, otherwise I'd go back instantly. 

First and foremost sleeping was better as a night owl. There is no real deadline for it. My  day could go on as long or as little as I'd like. Now I have to be in bed by 11pm at the latest to get any kind of decent amount of sleep cause I have to be up at 5am. As a night owl it wasn't a big deal to get delayed while having fun or taking care of stuff I had little time for earlier. If I went to bed at 5am instead of 3am I could just add a few more hours to my alarm clock. 
 

Shopping during the day is chaos compared to nighttime. I use to run in and out of stores for a few items quickly. Big shopping trips involving multiple stores would mostly be done in 40 minutes to an hour including travel time.  Now I'm lucky if it takes less than twenty minutes in the store to get a gallon of milk. Even stores that close early (wtf Costco?) It was better to go in about an hour before they close. But now that time frame is used by preparing dinner or other such things. 


Speaking of travel time driving during the day is 100 times more frightening than night time for me. There is massive traffic all the time, everything reflects the sun into my eyes making it hard to see, people leap out of driveways/side streets like cheap haunted house animatronics plus I don't have the advantage of headlights helping me. If a crazy driver is behind me at night headlights warn with more than enough time to get out of their way. Now I have check my mirrors &amp; blind spots constantly which makes it harder to focus in front of me. Often now motorcycles sneak up right next to me then blast their engines like a high pitched dragon roar which is scary as hell. At night motorcycle drivers tend to keep a distance from cars. Also things during the day tend to mix into one big moving picture for me. Everything is moving so it's harder to notice something suddenly change. At night everything is still so sudden movement is much more noticable. I have had way more close calls during the day than I ever did at night. 


Where I am it's been hot as fuck during the day which I'm not at all use to do. It's much harder to do any kind of physical work with the sun zapping my energy.  I feel drained just walking through a parking lot. Even when it's hot at night the sun isn't beating down on me so drinking water or wearing light clothes help a lot but during the day it's barley enough to not pass out.


In general people are lot kinder at night too. I've noticed way more pissed off people in the morning. They'll gladly risk a accident to gain a spot ahead in line at a drive through. They yell at clerks more and have much higher expectations of what they should be given or how fast things should be done. It's like the stress of what the day is going to be like is making them asshole. 

Oh ya and the night sky doesn't assault my eyes when I look up like daytime does. "

He said ""Dad , what are you doing here?"", cause he knew that his dad had passed away a couple days back. My uncle replied ""I just came to ask you if I could go to sleep in your bed , son"", to which my cousin replied ""yes sure dad"". Then he said i covered him with my covers and turned off my PS2 so he can get some rest, and as i was walking through the door I said ""goodnight dad, I love you"". He said that since he never had a chance to say goodbye to him, his dad came to visit him in the only way he could, through his dreams to say his final goodbye.

About 6 or 7 of us came back at my place at like 3am and had a drink on the terrasse. It was me, a couple of friends, my roommate, his girlfriend and her best friend. 

Her best friend was kind of hot and we had made out during the night but I was wasted so I thought I should just go to bed. I went in my bed alone and passed out. The following morning, I wake up and this same girl is naked next to me. I look at her and she's also waking up, so I ask her ""Did we have sex?"", because I seriously couldn't remember, and she says ""Not yet"". 

I was pretty hungover but I was like eh whatever, so we start. At the same time, my roommate and his girlfriend come back from the neighborhood chicken place. My roommate fucking loves that place, so he starts eating loudly and saying damn that chicken is good like repeatedly.  My room was right next to the dining room and my door was the kind that had shaded out glass so you could see through but not that much. It was also totally NOT soundproof. 

With my huge hangover, this new girl in front of me, the fact that my friend would understand what is happening very soon, the light blaring through the window-paned door and his fucking chicken comments every 5 seconds... I just couldn't.

So barely like a minute in and a half in, I told her we gotta stop. She looked pretty bumbed out. Must have been the worse sex she ever had.

1653,"I'm not sure if they are from recent expansions or not, but I have played with numerous attack cards that can be used to extensively exploit certain playstyles, requiring you to consider adding defensive cards to your deck. It really depends on what cards you draw to play with - lots of times my friends and I will all pick a certain number of cards ourselves and leave the rest up to chance. Creates some really janky strategies!"

1657,"**Fully** realize how terrible a price it is to pay to be forced to take anti-psychotics to function, and never EVER play it off as something minor. It's an ever-present and exceptionally draining sacrifice, and it has to be made every... single... fucking... day. For the rest of their life. Schizophrenics don't go off their meds because they're stupid or crazy. They drop them because it does terrible things to you, and taking them in many cases feels **significantly** worse in day to day life than being untreated. They have to spend every day reminding themselves that the long term picture is what matters and that they can not afford to listen to what their body and mind tells them is best.

Consider how many people can't stop smoking, or eat less junk food, because they can't make their long term logic take charge of their short term indulgence. Schizophrenics are making that choice every single day of their life when they take their meds. And what those meds do to your mind, body, and soul is thousands of times worse than having a slice of pie less, or skipping that cigarette. 

And if you can't take a strangers word on how terrible it is, then fucking try the meds yourself. Try going just one month with the side-effects *and* the subdued cognition and emotion that is part of the intended effect.

Show them the respect they deserve for making the choice to subject themselves to that torment, because they sure as shit don't do it for themselves. They do it for **you**. Never belittle that effort, and never fucking assume you know what it's like if you haven't tried it yourself."

1661,"I‚Äôm a travel consultant for a group of resorts with fees, and I just quote the whole amount with tax.  It makes things easier for both them, and me.

Sometimes though, despite me saying ‚Äúthis costs X amount including all taxes and fees‚Äù some people still think I‚Äôm playing tricks on them, and they‚Äôll be charged an additional fee that I‚Äôm not telling them about."
1662,"If grandpa told grandma ""maybe we shouldn't; isn't the cake-cutting kind of important?"" and grandma replied ""IDGAF, I want cake now"", it's offensive. If it's just grandpa going ""nice cake, I think I'll grab a piece"" because he forgot they were supposed to cut it or just didn't think about it, it's fine. That's my interpretation."

1665,"No doors close all the way, also they all creak when closing. The stairs sound like the beaches of Normandy too. 

Road doesn't get plowed in the winter. Actually, it just never gets plowed. Also, potholes.

Plants have trouble growing because of an insect infestation. Also, you have a mice infestation. You can get rid of the mice, but in doing so you took your eyes off the bats, who now moved into the attic. Also, their poop is poisonous. 

You have sulfur water. It's always sulfur, there's nothing you can do and everyone smells it. God you're gross.

 Your neighbors are very religious. All of them. And not the nice kind who leave you food baskets and dress well. No, it's the ""I saw through your kitchen window you were drinking wine on the Lord's day, you heathen. Also, your dog pooped in my yard again.""

Whenever you look to sell, the market crashes.

1670,"Because, historically speaking, we evolved to desire calories. The nutritional aspects of food were not as important as the calories. Food was scarce, so you needed some dense food energy. Now that food is not as scarce, we‚Äôre still wired to crave those delicious calories and we get fat."

1672,"That guy with the weird comb-over who used to be on ""The Apprentice"". "
1673,"There was this guy I had just met who was interested in me. I wasn‚Äôt too sure about him because I didn‚Äôt know him well and besides, we lived in different countries. My friend who was visiting and staying with me knew of this situation, and after a night out, she invited him to stay ovee at my place to watch a movie with us. We all fell asleep in the living room. In the morning, he and I were in the living room while my friend was in the kitchen. For some reason, when I lived in that country, every morning I had major gas. Like super loud, airy gas. It wasn‚Äôt smelly - just loud. It was like clockwork. This morning was no different, and since I really didn‚Äôt think anything would happen with this guy, I let a huge one rip. It was SO. LOUD. Even louder than my normal  ones. I‚Äôm acting like nothing happened while trying to gage his reaction through my periphery. The guy looks at me and asks, ‚ÄúWas that you?‚Äù (No shit, Sherlock, there‚Äôs no one else in this room). I turn towards him and say, ‚ÄúYes...do you mind?‚Äù I‚Äôm watching his reaction because even I thought this fart was gross and loud and because I‚Äôm waiting and wanting to scare him away. Completely unfazed, he says, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and then proceeds to talk about the plans for the day. Totally won me over. Been together 13 years, married for 5. "
1674,"Tom does strike me as a little off and the Scientology thing needs no explanation ... but of all the people in Hollywood, he really does treat people right. He worked with Dakota Fanning in 2004 for War Of The Worlds and he still sends her a birthday cake every year. He learns everyone's name in front and behind the camera. He gives the best and expects the best in return."

1679,"This seems petty to me, because it almost happened to me once. I only noticed when I was walking towards the building. All I had to go on was a fucking colored line on the sidewalk next to the parking spots, and it was a parking ""lane"" for higher-ups.

Gotta pretend to be perfect until you get past HR."
1680,Identity politics 
1681,"I don't think Taylor Swift ever explicitly stated she was bullied. She has said that writing songs and playing shows kind of alienated her from people but she even tells a story about one of her songs that she wrote for a talent show because she figured her friends would like it. I've never heard stories about her saying she was actually bullied or anything.

Now she did put on a fake accent for the early years of her career so she's definitely not completely authentic lol. I would say she's more shrewd than anything."

He sent in his resume, and then called 4-5 over the course of two days to check on it. We schedule an interview, and he called twice to confirm it (once immediately after, once the day before). Then he called 4-5 times in the days afterwards to see if a decision had been made. Any *one* of those calls would be acceptable, by my god man slow your roll! "

1700,"Oh for sure, I'm in no way condoning our behavior. Just saying that in the grand scheme of things we ""conscious human beings"" are just another ice age to the planet.

1708,"Seriously, there are other open world games I like better, but that's because they excel in areas outside of ""open world"" (combat, story, etc.). However, I have never found a game that did the open world exploration element better than BoTW. It's the platonic ideal of an open world game."

1714,"I think this happens when people for example get in a leader position, but sees it in a way that they thereby are given responsibility for the employees, and not power over them. 
I once heard a taekwondo instructor who said ""We give our students the skills to kill people, but teach them not to"". 

The same applies to leaders I think. A good leader knows he/she have the power to absolutely destroy an employee, but his greatest task is to never use that power. "

1719,"My spouse worked 10 years for a company in Israel, and we were in NC. Wasn't so bad, He worked afternoons. They didn't respect down time though. Before he left he hadn't had a vacation in four years. He worked on our honeymoon. I know his laptop back pack better then my purse."
1720,"To my wife and I: In the hospital and the pediatrician came in to discuss and administer vaccines to our day old child, my wife asked what each one did specifically.

1725,"That‚Äôs fucked up. It‚Äôs like suspending someone for puking. 

Almost all chicks have stained their pants in hs. Then we put on our gym shorts, borrow some, or tie a jacket/hoodie around us. Hell once I got high and *thought i peed my pants* and tied my bulkster winter jacket around me until I came down. (Laced w PCP I later found out. Bad times.)

1729,"I actually read this in a Turkish Airlines in flight magazine about 5 years ago.  I tried it and have been doing it ever since.  It also cuts down on water usage because there is also no need to wet your brush before hand so you don't have the tendency to leave the water running while you brush.  Plop toothpaste on brush, do the brushing, turn on water, spit, rinse off brush, turn off water, done."
1730,Nintendo 64.

1734,I believe he was a ronin in ancient Japan too.
1735,"&gt; I really hate when people bring up the ""who will take care of you when you get older?"" And quite honestly, I find that disturbing. 

I've worked in a few nursing homes. MOST  children rarely IF EVER visit their parents. It's astounding most have ZERO visitors at least in the three nursing homes I've worked in."
1736,"15 works just as well for more time demanding things such as folding the laundry among other things. The 'if it only takes' part is a mere matter of setting a perspective for yourself so it's all good :) I prefer yours though, it allows me more time to procrastinate! "
1737,It was a very calm talk. Everything was soft spoken and we encouraged her to remember everything she could. She told us that she saw grandma in a dream and we explained to her once she was out of the hospital that her grandma had passed away. My girlfriend started becoming very interested in the after life and has been wanting to consult a psychic but I am very skepticle about psychics. I told her if she ever wants to try it out I will support it. My daughter would have other dreams of her playing with grandma as a child. They would play barbies together. One time my daughter saw a picture of jesus and said she saw him in a dream with grandma. The last year her dreams have stopped and she hasn't really talked about what happened. But my girlfriend always talks about it with all her brothers and sisters and we all believe her because a 4 year old cannot lie like that. 
1738,"It really is. Quite safe, too. Despite what people think, nuclear has a very good track record. And all of the major nuclear disasters (Chernobyl, Fukishima, etc) have been caused by either human error or outstanding natural disasters.

1750,An old colleague went from answering calls on a help desk to being an anesthesiologist. We said he went from one mind-numbing job to another. 
1751,"I see many Christians say they feel themselves float up or something. Atheist usually describe it as being.. content and dark. I suppose is how'd you put it. It could really be either way. I've heard scientifically it was a brain coping mechanism but I haven't looked into it myself. Ive yet to hear a near death experience involving a hell or unpleasant experience, so it leads me to believe its either coping or a hell doesn't exist. Maybe if there is an afterlife, nothing is experienced until you're 100% dead"
1752,"Long story short, I had a bad reaction to a bunch of medication after a C-section and died for a short period of time. I never got to hold my son. I remember hearing people talking calmly but stearn and a lot of beeping. Then it was quite a bit like others described, calm, black, and then just nothing. I heard someone (probably a nurse) say that it was time to be a mommy and meet my boy. I faded in and out until eventually I ""woke up."" It sounds cheesey, but if it wasn't for my son, I probably would have never come back."
1753,"I mean I'm not saying, ""Wow this new death thing sounds amazing. Let me just try this to escape my worldly problems."" 

But the thought that in death theres a possibility that I could recognize a feeling I yearned for in life is soothing.

1759,"I not a helicopter parent, and I really don't like those types of parents, but I find myself looking over my kids more than my parents did when I was a kid more so because I don't want the authorities called on me by some of those helicopter parents than anything else. I think a lot of people feel similar. They want to let their kids out and have the same or similar kind of childhood they had, but the crazy parents ruin it for everybody.

1770,"I'm sorry, I guess I should get all emo and cry about being a victim of circumstances instead of owning up to the shit I was a part of, that's the new way of doing things in the new millennium.

1771,Eat as much sugar as we do.
1772,"About 2.5 years ago my biological mother (aka biomom) tried denying that she ever emailed my ex (I had requested nobody email my ex, biomom did, and my ex lit up my ass for 4 hours telling me somebody in my family sent her a nasty email... lots of drama, but I digress). 

I told mom I‚Äôd like to talk about it. She denied having emailed. I told her I have the email. She said my ex forged it. I told her she didn‚Äôt, as the language/voice was that of biomom‚Äôs, the font was the same, the signature the same, and that the email included information from my childhood that my ex and I had never spoken about. The emails headers regarding mail servers also appeared to be in order.

Biomom then tripledowns. She says that somebody must have hacked her yahoo account and sent the email, and that he hacker must have found information about my pre-internet childhood on the internet. 

‚ÄúSo your official story, mom, is that your email account was hacked, and the hacker read through all your email and discovered that 
1. Your son and his partner split up, then
2. Googled information about my childhood, then
3. Read enough of your email to understand your voice and write and talk exactly how you would, and then use that information to
4. Construct a farewell email to my ex which included said childhood information.

Is that your official story?‚Äù

The line was silent for about 0.628 seconds.
‚ÄúYes, that is what happened.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell mom, I‚Äôm sorry, but that is completely preposterous. Until you tell me the truth and apologize for going against my wishes, and then lying to me about it with the most ridiculous story, I don‚Äôt think we have anything more to say to each other.‚Äù

That was April is 2016. She and I haven‚Äôt spoken since. "

1776,"Our family has had a disturbing number of infant deaths. Three of my parents siblings, four of my cousins. 

For whatever reason we do not talk about them. They did not exist. Like I get no one has fond memories to share over someone who lived for only a few hours, but I still don't get why it's so taboo to bring it up."
1777,"This story doesn‚Äôt make your mom sound bad at all. This kind of stuff happens to all parents. (Even the santimommies who say it would never happen to them.) My husband and I drove for 3 hours, across 2 states, with our then-1-year-old not buckled into his car seat. We each thought the other had done it (I had done it, but I had to unbuckle him for some reason, got distracted packing the car, and forgot to buckle him up again.) I cried for 2 hours when I realized what could‚Äôve happened. "
1778,You made me laugh just now.  So cute.
1779,"I got the flu on my first day of a new job. Took three sick days my first week. They were really understanding and I paid back their kindness by working my ass off and making sure I more than made up for those three missing days. I‚Äôve only been here 4 months and I‚Äôve already been nominated for employee of the month twice. I was never a particularly exceptional worker, but knowing that they actually cared for my well being over my attendance makes me want to do better for the company. 

Stay with a place that says ‚Äúhealth comes first.‚Äù It‚Äôs rare. "
1780,"Nothing.  Until there is a court order or custody arrangement agreed to in mediation, either parent has the ability to take the child anywhere.  
If your marriage is ending, it‚Äôs imperative to get paperwork filed.  Once the court is involved they limit how far and long each parent can take the child.   

I have gone through this exact scenario. This very exact situation.   It‚Äôs awful.

But suffice to say that yes, there are a ton of people who are fucked in the head. And the other sad part is that you probably know or have interacted with more than one.

Someone I knew, and who seemed like a normal, laid-back kind of guy the few times that I'd met him, got arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to life without parole, for raping a 6-year-old girl. I had a friend who babysat that girl prior to (and after) the story went public, so I knew the little girl pretty well. 

I've known that I've had rage issues in the past, and I'd thought I'd worked past them for the most part at that point, but I have no doubt in my mind that if I'd heard about it before he was locked up, he'd be dead and I'd be still caught up in a court case.

EDIT: ""happened to"" is kind of the wrong phrase to use here; what happened to him was that he was brought to justice, which isn't bad in and of itself; what he actually did to deserve it, the details of the trial, that is some seriously disturbing shit."

He was bitching and arguing at the gate (departing from Mexico back home) about how he deserved an inflight iPad for the flight back because he paid a ""Lot of good money"" for this trip. He was incensed that there were no screens and you had to pay $15 or whatever. 

He just got louder and louder and more belligerent until the Pilot was called and we all had to watch him get escorted off. The worst was that his girlfriend/wife (quite young) had a toddler with her and the Pilot was telling her she could stay on board. She chose to get off the plane, all I could think was ""Oh honey no...."" 

There were no more flights out that day. So that guy bitching about $15 probably just cost himself another thousand +. "

Granted, stories about Bruce Willis being an asshole coming from people he's worked with are more likely to be representative of him than just fans who met him once, but even if he's often an asshole that doesn't mean he always is and is never nice.  Or maybe he's an asshole while filming but nice in other contexts."

1845,"My classmate is a prime example of this. So many stories to share. I used to be ""good"" friends with her, since she was enjoyable to be around when she wasn't being a princess. 

So the most minor thing was when she got a quote for her insurance. She was driving a newer Mustang (her moms who passed away) and she was 18. She ""shouldn't"" have to pay 4k per year, her dad should (her step dad was off the hook!). Then we had her birthday, where should just HAD to have a limo, the whole thing, etc. The limo thing fell through and we weren't talking for a while at this point. I just know she got turbo-drunk afterwards. She refused to communicate, thinking everything was either her way or she'd just dismiss you with that ""whatever"" attitude. 

Then in our second year it went over to group work, which she used to be really good with. By the middle of our second year we were not on speaking terms, but we were forced to work together in large group projects. That was the worst semester of my life because she let her personal hatred get in the way of doing good work, but only when she was around certain other parties. There was the time she said she'd get three things done over the weekend, got none of it done then tries to play it off as ""you are lying Penguinbashr, we never agreed I'd do any of this"" then pull out the agenda where it was right fucking there ""I WILL DO THESE THREE THINGS"". We then had to test 12 SoP's but I had to get pulled away to something else and was going to hand off three of mine to her which was unacceptable because she's ""already done three and that's my part"". She said this knowing full well I had already covered her ass multiple times during the project so we would meet deadlines.

Then she accused me of fudging hours worked when I was sitting at ~50 and she was sitting at ~20  to make her look bad, except it really showed that I put the work in. Her and her friend were at 20, I was at 50, and the other two were around 30. It's not even the hours worked that bother me as I knew that I'd be putting more work in naturally, I just wanted to see some honest effort. 

She complained I was holding her/the group standards too high, despite us (me) only getting a 80% on our mid-report. All of our instructors also knew that she was not doing any work at all. One even noted on our report ""Is this true?"" to her role of being the editor. She thought editing would be going through my sentences and changes up the words to how she felt they should be. No formatting, etc, only changing up some sentences in a 70 page report.

We have been graduated for a year now, and she didn't get into Uni the last year (we did a 2 year college course) due to her grades (She actually has a much higher GPA than me, but book smarts =/= transferable lab skills, which I won't even touch on as she NEVER did lab work). She is slated to start this next year last I heard through mutual friends, and that she has matured ""somewhat"" now that she's in her 20's. I still follow her on instagram for whatever reason, though she has me blocked everywhere but FB (where we needed to communicate for group work).

I guess if I was really, really petty I could have blocked her on FB in response to her blocking me on everything else, but getting the project done was too important to me, and has paid off as I now have one of the best jobs of my life as a solo lab tech (sounds awful but it's damn amazing, great pay, etc).

Let's call him Trevor. Trevor was known for making up ridiculous stories for attention. One day, he was talking about how he had gotten into a knife fight with his father and I was in the middle of the worst day of my period and I just let loose on him, which if you know me is very out of character-- I'm usually the quiet one. I told him how much everyone at the table hated his presence and how I thought his stories were ridiculous and fake and I was done dealing with his shit. I think he ended up running away crying. I don't feel like THAT much of a dick for it because the kid was genuinely annoying, but in retrospect there was probably a lot more going on at home than what met the eye. "

THey had bankers and computer programmers hoping for a minimum wage job.  Lucky for you that you apparently never lived near the edge, sounds like you lived a sheltered life and have a lot of assumptions on how easy it is to just fix little problems when for people at the bottom, it's not that easy.  Jobs are only now getting easier to find but still not THAT easy for someone without a functioning car.

First time they found one of my four wisdom teeth in my temple (they already got another one out at the time). They had to wake me up and take me to their brand new 3D CAT-scan machine (never used before) to find that tooth in my temple. My surgeon never saw this happen in his 15-20 years of practice. Supposedly I tried to keep the wisdom tooth that they took out prior to waking me up and I tried to fight off several nurses before getting to the machine.

Second time I had to get a scarred snapped tendon out of my hand. Half-way through surgery they had to wake me up for me to do a fist (so they would know if they got all of it). They woke me up and I looked at my hand filleted wide open, made a full fist, everyone in the room made a quick celebration and then they knocked me back out for the remainder of the surgery."

My mom died, dad might as well be dead he left when I was a kid. Before she died, my mom had severe dementia and cancer, it was a relief for everyone. I missed talking to her long before she died.

My brothers are all selfish pieces of shit living their own lives wherever they are. I'm better off without them in my life.

Bad things happen, all we can do is prepare for the worst and hope for the best. I used to worry about home intruders killing my family.

He takes credit mostly for driving out Joja Mart from town if you pull that off successfully and only talks about his shitty shop. He ignores his family during festivals, is unprofessional (showing up at your front door whenever he please). So to answer your question, the upside is ethics.

Oh also they have cheaper corn seeds and are open on Wednesdays."

1977,"I was a rich kid. My parents are still rich, I am personally not. We were not SUPER rich by any means, but I did grow up in a big ass house, had all these designer bags given to me by my mom, travelled, went to a private school and was able to go to college twice without going into student debt. 

Things I worry about:

- Family legacy: I'm a commercial artist by trade, but I worry about the family business and whether or not my generation will be able to sustain it. Luckily my brother and sister are more business-oriented than I am and have plans to run the company when my dad and his brothers are retired, but I know they'll want me to step up when that time comes as well. The decision to be part of that is always on the back of my mind, especially since being part of that will mean having to move back to my home country, and I really hate it there.

- Judgement; I tend to not tell people that I had a privileged upbringing, or that I don't have student debt, because I feel like they take me less seriously knowing that I'd had it good most of my childhood.

- More Judgement; it's not just other people that judge me, but my parents and extended family also have a tendency to judge me and my decisions. I must always make decisions that look good on the family and don't taint the family name, this includes how I look in photographs, the work I produce, my reputation, the people I associate with, who I marry, etc. I've failed my family many times in this regard and have come to a point where I almost don't care, but it still eats at me in day-to-day decisions. I'm not marrying ""up"", for example, since my fiancee did not come from a prominent, wealthy, chinese family, but I try to make up for it by dieting to make sure I look really really good in my wedding photos so that when other people see them my parents would not be ashamed of me.

- I worry that my fiancee will leave me eventually due to my family's crazy.

- Financial equality; as I mentioned, I am personally not rich by any means but being part of a rich family makes you either very aware of how much money you have or completely unaware. I am the former. I am quite aware of how much less I personally have compared to the rest of my family, and am trying very hard to catch up. So far I've managed to save up a good bit of money, but not quite enough yet to invest significantly.

- Family; family to us is very very important. I live half a planet away from my parents and worry that I'm being a horrible daughter, even if I know that being here is much better for my mental health."

1987,"I am by no sense of the word an expert, but I have about 12 years of combined experience in various martial arts (F19), and what I get most often is teenage boys trying to make themselves feel good by explaining martial arts concepts to me. Like working focus mits and stuff, one guy was like ‚Äúoh yeah when you hit you really need to make sure to aim past the pad so you hit it better.‚Äù I was like really? Wow thank you for enlightening me with your 3 months of experience. Another guy said to me (I was teaching a fitness class and suggested if he wanted to hit things, to try our danzan ryu ju jitsu class). He looked at me and was like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no strikes in ju jitsu.‚Äù I said ‚Äúno, there‚Äôs no strikes in Brazilian jiu jitsu, but there are strikes in Japanese and dan zan ryu ju jitsu.‚Äù

Usually I try to bite my tongue and let my experience and technique speak for itself (they usually shut up once we start working together), because I believe you can always learn things from people with different perspectives. But when people try to explain something that they have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about or I get the feeling there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a man and I know what I‚Äôm talking about, little girl‚Äù I shut that down real quick.

I'm not making a joke here. Our sex ed was all about condoms and birth control, respect, STDs, waiting until marriage (contradictory to the birth control discussion, but whatevs), diagrams of cervixes, uteruses, and scrotums...

Are those even the correct plurals? Who knows? The classes weren't very good. It's probably scroti, or something.

No one actually sat us down and said, ""Here's what to expect your first time. Here's how you initiate. Here's how and when to give oral sex.  Here's what to do if you cum prematurely, as you probably will the first time. Here's how to have an amazing experience, for both you and your partner, because God knows this will save you a fuckton of hangups and issues down the track.""

One of my dearest wishes is that human beings - especially those in charge of education - stop being so squeamish about sex. The world would be a happier place if we just talked about it openly and honestly.

Edit: It should also be taught that it doesn't matter which gender you fuck, as long as both they and you enthusiastically consent. That's probably going to take a while though, because amazingly, it's 2018 and some people still have issues with LGBTQ folk."

My mother said something to me which haunts me even today.

I  was almost 8 years old and was playing with my little sister. We were  playing house. I had short hair which was clipped to side. I was wearing  a red top which had flowers near the neckline. We were playing house  and I was pretending to be my sister's mother. It was so fun and we were  constantly giggling. Then I wore my mom's favourite locket which was  very expensive. And that's where I went wrong, I guess.

After  playing, I removed it and placed it back where it was. After mom came  from office she wanted to wear that gold locket. She started searching  for it because somehow it disappeared from its place. She called us and  asked if we touched it. I happily replied that yes we were playing but I  kept it back. By this time she was furious and accused me of misplacing  the gold locket. I pleaded that I haven't misplaced it and kept it  back. But she wouldn't listen. Then she said to me,

**‚Äú** **You don't need to come back home from school tomorrow. You should just get down near the lake, jump in and just die.‚Äù**

I  still remember I didn't cry, I didn't say anything. I still remember  she wore a dark green dress with khaki color dupatta. I still remember I  wore a red top that day. I still remember I tried strangling myself the  next day just to see how it feels to die.

That  day an 8 year old girl grew up. I had no memory of this incident till I  turned 16. Then one day it all rushed in. I wondered was I really less  important that a piece of jewellery. Its been 13 years since this and  some more incidents later I realised that, I may never have that mother  daughter bond that I craved.

2122,"1) No monetization. People did things because they *enjoyed it* not because they felt entitled to payment for it. The last bastion of the **free** exchange of ideas is game modding, and even then in the last couple years, this attitude has cropped up that modders deserve to be paid more than the developers who made the damn game. Monetization has destroyed almost everything that used to be fun about the internet. Youtube was full of quirky weird videos. Literally the same month that Youtube became fully monetized, corporations took over (there was a post in /r/dataisbeautiful) a while ago that compared the top videos and monetization status of Youtube). Monetization (or stripping it) also became a weapon to be used against 'wrongthink'. When you introduce monetization you allow people to become dependent on it, then you can threaten them by stripping it away if they don't comply. Oh boy I can't wait for the people who defend monetization to ask why we aren't paying to view Wikipedia articles.

2) Less moderation, administration, and ""hurt feelings"" in general. Once upon a time, the internet was just full of fringe weirdo losers. Around the same time monetization took off, the general masses flooded the internet and with it came their fragility and pathetic whining. I look at the kind of threads that get locked on Reddit, the kind of comments that can get you banned, the obsessive over-moderation... the fact that people will bait you into an argument and then literally cry to admins to try to get you banned to 'win'... that shit didn't used to happen. If you were a crybaby bitch you were most likely to be the one to get banned. The internet was once touted as being the future of free speech and the free exchange of ideas. Now it's ending up being one of the biggest oppressors of it.

3) The internet itself wasn't weaponized. Whether its being able to form giant lynch-mobs of idiots to harass and scream at people you disagree with, or being able to use it to maliciously target business with harassment campaigns to force them to do the will of the masses. With the mainstreamization of the internet it became easy for any asshole to get a stupid opinion, share that stupid opinion, and then get others to act on their stupid opinions. It was harder to do things like contact a company, or even talk to your congressman, which meant there was a barrier of entry that weeded out low-effort assholes.

4) No fucking 'donations'. No shitty GoFundMe handouts in the five-figures because ""I got a racist message on a receipt"". The idea of someone making a living being a useless shit playing video games on Twitch was non-existent and would've been considered downright embarrassing. The only money in gaming was in Korean Starcraft and you had to be top-tier for that. Now any prick with a camera can earn more money than a brain surgeon. I think this shit is seriously going to fuck up a lot of kids. It's like the ""I don't need to study, I'm going to be a football player"", except that was only limited to people who actually played football and made it on a team. Literally every shit kid these days has access to what it takes to be a Twitch millionaire."

Also, as an example, how Stormzy is gaining media attention for funding lower class black people in the UK to go to College. If it were the other way around and it was Eminem funding only white people to go to College there would be an absolute shit storm and he would then be a racist. But somehow Stormzy it being praised for the same thing? "

I'm already kind of dreading him ordering because a list usually means means 3+ sandwiches, and they're almost never complete, they always forget to write down type of bread or something. But this guy looks at me kinda weirdly and shakes his head when I ask him what he wants. Like he doesn't even want to tell me. He then asks if we serve pizza. We do. He orders a pizza, then right before I'm about to pop it into the toaster to cook it, he asks if I can put tuna on there before I toast it. Okay. Weird, but still palatable, I guess? So I slather tuna all over this pizza. Then the guy asks if I can also put ALL the veggies on this pizza before I cook it too. I ask him if he's sure. He nodded and so I put all the veggies on this tuna pizza. That includes lettuce and spinach. So now this dude is gonna have hot ass lettuce and spinach on his pizza, along with every other veggie. Finally, before I cooked it, he asked for a good amount of mayo and hot sauce on it. This monstrosity complete, I threw it in the oven. It smelled so bad when I pulled it out, and the mayo had melted and gone to a weird shiny yellow. When I rang him out he apologized and explained it was for a friend, and that he would never order for this friend again because of how fkin gross this looked. I thought it was gross but funny. "

2174,"She was my friend for a year before my feelings started to change. So I worked up the guts and told her. And she told me I was adorable but she wasn't into girls.

I was embarrassed to death. I played it off, we did the whole we'll just keep being friends thing.

That didn't work out. She was always the type of person who would use you if she could. Not that she's some sort of manipulative bitch, but the sort of person who if you offered a finger, she'd take your whole arm. You'd have to tell her a hard no before she'd stop.

And the fact that I was still crushing on her meant she could basically ask me to do anything and I'd do it for her and never say no.

I found myself bending over backwards to try and make her happy. I was stupid and thought that maybe...she'd like me if I just stuck around doing enough nice things.

Eventually I realized no matter what I did, it didn't change anything. And she never ever appreciated the extra stuff I went out of the way to do for her. She was always asking and expecting more.

Last weekend, I tried one last time and realized she only ever hit me up when she needed something or was bored. She'd never care or think about me normally. I was just a convenient piece of entertainment, a game when she'd pick up when she's bored and drop when she's done. I don't think I even register as a friend in her head.

I still feel like shit. I just bought 2 bags of sour gummies and 2 bags of hot cheetos and spent my weekend sadly binge eating as I realized I threw away the last 6 months of my life on a girl who doesn't give two shits about me.

I thought at the very least we were friends...but now I look back on it. Were we ever friends at all? Maybe once, but it feels so long ago. My confession ruined the whole dynamic. I don't know if we can even go back to being friends anymore. I fucked it up so bad.

Edit:
God I'm still so sad about this. I know it's not really her fault but all I wanted was her to give a shit about me. To maybe just...wonder how I was doing sometime? Maybe look at something and be reminded of me. To worry about me when I was driving or working late. To ask me how I was when I was sick.

I did all of that for her. I made her my number one. It's just she couldn't do the same back to me. And it hurts so much to realize that if she died tomorrow, I'd be devastated. But if I died tomorrow, she'd be mildly inconvenienced."

So having a mortgage, getting married, having kids, DIY projects, finally starting a proper career and even owning a car or paying taxes are things which have been pushed back to a much later starting date.

In 2013 I had a long-time client (good relationship with them) launching a new biz. They wanted me on board full time to handle all their marketing but it meant relocating across the country with my family. The pay was good and I knew I could market this business and grow it but I had reservations about losing my freedom that comes with self employment. Wife and I agreed anyhow and went for it. Over a couple years of leading their sales and marketing I was primarily responsible for growing that startup into a multi million dollar brand and taking it global. 

Despite that, I never even got close to HALF the salary they promised me (didn't get it in writing, they just kept telling me I wasnt working hard enough), refused to offer benefits to anyone ""because they didn't have to"", treated me and other employees like shit including daily rants about no one working hard enough no matter how hard you're working, and writing me up repeatedly for being on social media despite the fact that I handled all their marketing... and needed to be on social for that.  The list goes on.  That job pushed me into depression that required medication, I gained like 100 lbs, and hated life daily. After 3 years of nonsense and false promises I finally gave the middle finger and left. 

Never again will I worked for another company. Self-employed and staying that way.

Writing would be easier but many people weren‚Äôt literate so. Maybe find a monastery or convent? They were literate. I know a little Latin so that might help.

It was hotter than two rats fuckin' in a wool sock, though...we pulled in after spending two months making a bubble off of the coast of some country somewhere, so going from a sealed steel tube to the desert was a bit of a shock.

Modern mattresses are extraordinarily CHEAP to make.  It's foam.  Foam not so different from the stuff we sometimes use for packing materials in computer hardware boxes.  ""Memory foam"" is dirt cheap.  Even further, a mattress is just a rectangular shape.  Maybe with a *tiny* bit of shaping.

People have an expectation that mattresses are expensive.  This enables companies to sell them for insanely marked up prices.

Nearly everyone owns at least a single mattress.  Or, you share a larger mattress with another person.  So 100% of the population wants this product.  You'd be hard pressed to name a dozen other products for which that is true (water... maybe internet... I got to two)."

2446,"A former family friend unwittingly tore my mother's family in half this way, to the point that I didn't even realise the other half existed 'til I was, like, twenty years old.

It was my christening. My mother was dreading a certain teenager cousin of hers showing up, so she made a blanket ban on all kids showing up. Her aunt, knowing she had a feud or *something* with her cousin, threw a tantrum about it but my mother went ""NOPE NO KIDS, ANY OF THEM, EVER.""

Cue my dad's friend's wife insisting on dragging her toddlers along *anyway*.

Two or three of my mother's aunts lost their shit because YOU SAID NO KIDS, HOW DARE.

Cue my grandmother, and the only one of my mother's aunts with any sense, jumping into the fray to defend my mother.

Cue a massive spat that continued/escalated until the aunt-with-actual-sense died two years later of ovarian cancer.

The other aunts were still so pissed they didn't show up to her funeral.

After they failed to show up to the funeral, my grandmother and my mother's cousin (daughter of the aunt with sense) were utterly infuriated and went, ""that's it, they're fucking dead to us.""

None of them have been spoken to ever since.

Up until I was, like, twenty, I thought my grandmother only had one sister, that was how fucking serious it was."

2463,"When I was a senior in high school my mother, brother, sister and I were headed back to Atlanta from visiting family for Thanksgiving in Chicago, I believe in hwy 65.

In front of us a Jeep was towing a Uhaul trailer that was almost empty as it passed an 18 wheeler. This was in the windy af part of Indiana where all the windmills are, so of course the draft off of the 18 wheeler pulled the Uhaul into the grassy median.  This pulled the Jeep into the median, skidding sideways until it starts to roll. 

I think it rolled four times in total, but about two rolls deep you see something kind of large launch like 50 ft out of one of the back windows. We were the first people to stop and my mom is an RN so she was checking the lady out, but she was just super freaked out and kept worrying about her dog, a dog we couldn't find. 

We arrive at the conclusion that her dog is what we must have seen fly out of the car, so my very fit high school self starts running down the median of hwy 65 in the middle of November wearing nothing but flipflops, gym shorts, and a t shirt. I made it about two miles when I found this very shocked pit bull - lab mix trying to cross three lanes of traffic.  He manages to cross, and I follow, and after another half miles of chasing the pup just collapses. 

I got to him and could only really see a little cut on his ear from where I was so I figured I'd just pick up this 90+lb dog and carry him 2.5 miles back to the scene of the crash for the lady. As soon as I reach under him to pick him up my hand gets super warm. Turns out there was a gash up his front leg on the far side, almost all the way down to his back hip. Apparently my hand had slid in his shoulder and sort of down the cut along his back, so my arm was covered in blood just past my elbow.

So I rotate myself to the cut side so when I picked him up my chest sort of held the gash closed, and started my treck back to the car. After only a quarter mile or so a cop car pulled into the median, so I crossed the three lanes of traffic carrying this doggo to try to get a ride from him. 

When I get to the guard rail I ask the cop if he will hold this literally unconscious dog for a second so I can hop over the guard rail. He says, and I quote ""I've been bit by dogs one too many times to do that.""  

My mom runs an animal shelter from her house and has since I was 1.  At that point I'd never really been around fewer than 15 dogs at any given point, and had been bitten dozens, if not a hundred times breaking up inadvertant dogfights, dealing with sick/timid dogs, etc.  

I respond to the cop without thinking and just say ""I can almost guarantee you I've been bitten more than you, and I'm just in high school. This dog is literally unconscious."" Keep in mind I was still on the traffic side of the guard rail.  He was not willing to take it, but a few minutes later my brother pulled up in my moms car and held the dog while I hopped over. Then I got in the back of the cop car with the dog and headed to the crash. 

The lady ended up with only minor bruises and scratches, and the dog was okay after 142 stitches. 

I rambled a lot more than I intended to in that story. Sorry about that, but I don't want to take the time to go back and consolidate it XD"

One of the biggest things I took away from that show was when I was watching it with my mother once in my teens while it was on-air; she noted that it takes an incredibly brilliant person to pretend to be stupid.

Come to find out Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow are two really well-educated individuals and pretty brilliant actors.

It's not really related to your point but just thought it was a fond memory of mine to share. You're totally right that the writers picked and chose the times for Joey and Phoebe to either be utterly stupid or absolute savants for the point of comedy which was funny but, as you said, inconsistent."

There was an episode of ER with this! Doctors Pratt and Gallant were pulled over because they fit a description of a couple of violent suspects, and the encounter quickly devolved due to certain things in the car looking suspicious. (For those unfamiliar, these particular doctors were black.) From the cop''s perspective, the two really did fit the BOLO description, but he could have handled it better, like not making the situation overtly racist.

Later, that same cop ended up on the ER table, with Pratt and Gallant both being on duty. Quote from the show: ""This must be real scary for you. All the white doctors have left. Now it's just you...and a couple of n\***ers with knives."""

The Schlieffen Plan (better described as a ""Schlieffen Concept""; there was no singular ""Plan"") involved violating Belgian neutrality to outflank the French fortresses along the frontier, sweep the French Army into a pocket, and achieve victory before turning east to face Russia. There was no ""stealth"" about it, and in fact the French recognised that the Germans would attempt an invasion of Belgium to attack France because they knew the strengths of their fortresses.

*However*, the French thought that the German main effort would come through the Ardennes, hence why their far-left flank facing Bulow and Kluck was covered only colonial troops, reservists, and the small British Expeditionary Force. They had no idea that the Germans would try to squeeze three armies through the Belgian fortress of Liege, and then send two of them further west to make a grand encirclement.

And the Germans didn't just ""stop"" at Paris: the French Sixth Army attacked Kluck's right flank out of Paris and forced him to move west, opening a gap between him and Bulow that the British Expeditionary Force attacked into, forcing the Germans to retreat to the Aisne."

- Guys have treated me like an achievement, whereas girls treat me like a career.
- Guys are more assertive about what they want, especially with kissing; girls are more receptive.
- In bed with guys, there's a *goal*, and a start/end time, and their idea of foreplay is much narrower; with girls, there's no clear start or end, no goal except to enjoy each other, and more of an emotional connection.
- Guys want to *make* me cum, girls want to *see* me cum.
- Guys seem to have more hangups about toys - like it's impugning their manhood if I want a vibe; girls are more like, ""Hell yeah, I can't believe you're *letting* me use this on you!""
- Guys' dirty talk &amp; stories are more about specific acts; girls' dirty talk &amp; stories are more about how things feel, both physically &amp; emotionally.

Obviously, each of these is a spectrum, and I'd say it's more of a 75/25 distribution - like, they're odds or tendencies, not invariable absolutes.  But then, I'm also skewed more toward open-minded folks, so I have no idea how representative my experiences are."

The conclusion he came to was that the natural resonance of the structure is 19 Hz; he set up a test where he put people in a room (controlled setting) and turned a stereo to 19 Hz, without their knowledge. It's too low to hear, but the test subjects started complaining about feeling unsettled, like there was an oppressive force, and that they had to leave immediately  (fun fact: in the movie Irreversible, the director added a 19 Hz tone to the score during the rape scene, to make people feel even more uncomfortable). He also found that the same resonance exists in our eyeglobs, causing us to sometimes see things that aren't actually there.

My gas station by law has to take can returns on deposits because we sell them.

A guy came in with a huge 30 pack worth of cans in a plastic bag that was over flowing and dropping cans everywhere.

Im the assistant manager, so dealing with that becomes my responsibility. I also honestly pride myself on my kindness and compassion. I get really irritated with the world when I see people be a dick when they could just not be.

After a particularly long shift I was somewhat close to being able to go home but still had some work to do. I cant go home till the paperwork is done and it was all jacked up I still had a bit to sort out. So this guy comes in with cans to return stopping me from working on it. Its an unspoken rule that we dont actually do the can returns in large numbers. If you bring a can or two we will do it but we are not a redemption center. I think he was homeless. He was not rude in anyway about it either, he is the customer you want to deal with which makes this even worse. He was actually very soft spoken and timid I suspect he has dealt with a lot of shit in his life. He even offered to clean them out once he noticed some of them still had beer/soda in them. But I was a dick and just pissed that I had to deal with this instead of working on the paperwork.

The actual interaction in more detail happened like this.

At first I outright lied and told him we cant take that many. It was just a dick move because I didnt wanna deal with it. We absolutely can and are also required to by law. He looked at me and thinking about it now the look he gave me kills me inside. He had the most crestfallen look and just said ""can I please just return a few of them? Im really hungry"". Now at this point its where it fucking kills me I missed him saying this at the time. He wasnt doing this to get a stick of gum he was doing it because he wanted to eat and the redemption center is a 25 minute car ride 6-7 hour walk away. He most likely could not get there. This at the time went right over my head. I was just pissed. I just said fuck it its going to be faster to deal with it then talk my way out of this. So I said fine and again for no reason other than to be a dick I said we will only take 12 of them. He gratefully accepted as I was returning them the bottom few were covered in beer/soda and still had some in them. I felt my blood rise I hate the smell of alcohol and it was *everywhere*. I think he noticed because he immediately offered to clean them out. I outright ignored him and said nothing just to be a dick and make him feel bad for making me do this. I walked outside to pour them out with a nasty irritated look on my face that I know he saw. I told my cashier to give him 12 bottle returns (.60 cents) and went to the back to put them in the return cart he was gone when I came back.

An hour or two passed and I started to process the interaction in my head and I have not been this disappointed in myself in a long time. I had an opportunity to show kindness and compassion to someone who genuinely needed it. Something normally I always do and will go quite a bit out of my way to do so. To me it defines a big part of who I am. Its part of what lets me sleep with a clean conscience and feel like a good person.

Nope, I was the very type of person I fucking despise. I dont think he will but I hope he comes back so I can apologize to this man from the bottom of my heart.

TL;DR. I was an ass to a homeless person who just wanted to eat and I am incredibly ashamed of myself."

Neurologically speaking, it strongly suggests that dogs experience love in much the same way we do. 


It changed (enhanced might be the better word) the way I view my dogs. I now know that when they look at me so intently, their little neurons are firing like crazy with anticipation. Like they just want to know what I‚Äôm thinking and what I expect next from them. How can they please me (ask for love) so that I will give good scritches and belly rubs (how we give love).

He then started the blog, watched whichever movies people recommended he watch, and wrote a running commentary on them. Here are some of his comments about Alien (1979):

&gt; Roomie was right. I dont want to watch this. I don't want to rwathc this movie.

&gt; I'm going to finish it, or try to.

(...)

&gt; Just to point out: I have very strong medications that encourage sleep quite easily. I point this out because last night I DID NOT SLEEP. I know someone in the comments thought one particular phrase of jumbled characters was an appropriate reaction. I wasn't trying to type at that point, though. What you see there is what happens when hands are shaking so badly that they just smash into the keyboard over and over again. There were tears. There was hyperventilating. I felt cold, I felt numb, I went hoarse. I think this is the first horror movie I have ever watched. If the rest are anything close to the level of this, it will be the very last.

&gt; Now then. I've got that off my chest. Let's talk about the movie.

(...)

&gt; This movie is a tour de force of concentrated and relentless terror without escape. I'm quite sure of two things: that it's a cinematic accomplishment with few peers, and that I never want to see it ever again. Holy fuck this movie should go to hell. "

 She said the male doctor told her everything was going to be okay, and that we were safe and sound. After her experience. She checked out of the hospital  and a couple of weeks later turned up at the same hospital with a cake and card, hoping to find the male doctor that took care of her. 

When she got there, she described him, and the woman at the help desk was confused. There had been no male doctor that day, or any day. All the staff were females. The said man never even worked there.

My great-grandmother lived to be 102, and there really wasn't much left of her in there by then. She was still able to walk (very slowly) in her 90s, but she started losing her place in time and her memory regardless of how active she was. At one point, she was 100% convinced I was her son, who was in his 70s, and I was like 12 at the time. She had definitely completely lost touch with reality at that point.

""Amber"" was ""12"". Everyone would share vague personal information, like the state they were in, but nothing detailed because we weren't idiots. She kept asking for zip code. Like... ??? That's weird even for an adult, but no middle schooler would ask someone for a zip code in casual conversation unless they were sending mail. So anyway, I blocked ""her"" ass.

Right now, I can go days or weeks without seeing someone from a different ethnic background.  I live in a small town in the midwest, and work in another small town.  Day to day, there's no real multiculturalism, but I can drive to the city (where I used to live) and it's like any other big city, with varying levels of multiculturalism based on which part of the city you're in.  

I do know a handful of people who have never strayed from their small town...have never eaten in an Asian restaurant, and have probably never spoken to someone with a different skin color.  Those people probably can't imagine living in a place where everyone is so different.  It's what you're accustomed to, and if you've only ever experienced one thing, you have nothing to compare it to.

I guess the big down-side for me is the food.  I have to plan a 30-40 mile drive if I want to get to an asian/indian/hispanic grocery store or get to a decent restaurant."

2940,"I used to get high for my overnight retail job sometimes and always got way more done those days. I'd just jam to music and bust ass. Whereas when I'd be sober I would find I'm more likely to get distracted, think of random things I had to walk across the store to do(basically to pass time and cause bored), talk with coworkers, check out products while stocking, take a long dump, etc.

I wasn't a bad worker at all sober, but all those minute long distractions add up when compared to hours of completely focused work. I think the biggest time saver was not socializing, I have found that even if you keep working while talking you still get far less done. When I was stoned I would avoid talking as much as possible cause my voice changes a lot when high, and general paranoia.

Anyways, I know everyone behaves differently when high, but for myself I've always found it to be really good for getting anything done that you don't have to think too much about. 

Edit: Just thought of my other trick for complete focus at mindless tasks, audio books. I've always been a reader, but never used audiobooks. Then last year I was reading a book series in my free time and didn't want to put it down for work so I thought of buying the audiobook. Now 90% of the time I listen to ABs instead of music at work, as I find I can let most of my awareness focus on the narration while still working effectively. Days fly by so fast and I've grown to enjoy work most of the time. Anyone who can use headphones at work, and enjoys reading I highly recommend trying it out. "

Also with the exception of retail the week between xmas and new years most businesses either completely shut down or go down to skeleton staff so there is lots of people away on holiday. I think as we don't have something like thanksgiving xmas seems to be the time where families will travel  far and get together and do the big feasts as well as the usual xmas traditions. 

The hilarious part of it all is so much of the christmas symbolism, cards, decorations, trees etc still have that snowy winter vibe to it and there is very few Australian Christmas related music, props etc. "

2986,"I guess I can chime in. Am male.

I've ""dated"" (to say been in a monogamous sexual relationship with) both men and women. 

People are kind of just people but there are some notable differences in a few categories between men and women.

**Dating**

Like, actually going on dates.

With women it was pretty straight forward. For the most part, I pick the places, plan the event, make reservations, get tickets, whatever. It's just generally assumed between the two of us that I'm in charge and whether or not it's a good night is partially dependant on my choices. When it comes time to pay, my wallet is out infinitely more often than not. The actual pulp of the date is pretty different too. With women it's always been closer to your traditional dinner and a movie or an early breakfast followed by a hike or something along the lines of a stereotypical date.

Dating men, however is a different monster. Unlike in most instances with women, picking ""dates,"" is much more akin to ""What do you feel like doing tonight?"" Be that dinner and a movie, so be it. Sometimes that happens, but I found more often that with old boyfriends I was more often met with ""let's hang out with x"" or ""I kinda just wanna sit around and watch y"" or the oh too familiar ""I dont know, man, does it matter? Grab me a beer.""

In the event of an actual date, the worst part was coming time to pay. There's nothing quite as frustrating as ""how are we dividing the check,"" followed by eight minutes of pseudo-arguing, swiping wallets and cards from each other in an attempt to use our own, and then glaring at the one who paid with irritated promises of ""I'm getting it next time.""

Over all it was easier to organize dates with women and dating men felt a lot more akin to two guy friends hanging out and trying to curb boredom.

**Shared Living**

I've also lived with both boyfriends and girlfriends.

A lot of living standards are entirely dependant on the individual sharing occupied space but there are a couple of general things that I can apply to gender lines.

Women In general tend to be more inclined towards order and cleanliness. Now, I've had girlfriends that were slobs and boyfriends that were neat freaks, but this seems to be a rarity in my personal experience data. For the same reasons, women tended to nag about chores, errands and the like wherein men were much more binary with a simple ""clean it up,"" if they were neat freaks, one and done, or applied a dont-give-a-shit mentality.

Further, living with women has yielded the conclusion that clothes belong literally everywhere outside of the common space. Bedroom? Clothes EVERYWHERE. Master Bathroom? Clothes. So many clothes. Closet? We don't talk about the closet.

At least the majority of men were courteous enough to put their small mountain of clothes in a pile and shove it to the back corner of a room or something. 

When dating a woman, I would notice lotions, nail polishes, hair accessories strewn about everywhere, all the time. Not something you deal with with most men.

Men, however... there is a smell that women don't produce so noticeably. Any apartment/home I shared with a boyfriend usually had one portion of it, be it the laundry room, bathroom, whatever, that would just regularly smell foul. Unwashed clothes, unclean linnens or unflushed toilets, men just seem to produce overall more odor.

**Sex**

I'm not going to get too much into detail, and instead am going to generalize it into a few basic sentences. This is not universal by any means but is definitely true in my experience. 

Men:

9 times out of ten 

""Hey do you wanna fool ar-"" 

Pants are off before sentence is finished.

Women:

5 times out of ten

""Hey do you wanna fool around?""

10 minutes of coyness or teasing

10 minutes of making out/feeling up

Sex
 
The other 5 are ""not right now.""

Men are, generally, more apt for sexual contact than not. I blame testosterone.

Further, sex is completely different. With women it's fairly straightforward. If there are no sub/dom kinks, then the power structure is more or less laid out to start. When who does what and how.

With men, it takes a lot more time to get into the swing without the awkwardness of verbal communication. If its not clearly laid out who's top and bottom, or if both parties are switch hitters, there's a lot of ambiguity as to who does what, when, and how. That being said, I've found that men are generally more geared towards enthusiasm in foreplay and the intent of both parties reaching climax. Men also tend to be much more willing to share kinks and predelictions.

As I said, none of the above in any category is universal and these are simply personal experiences quantified into observable data.

Despite the perceived benefits of dating men, I ended up settling down with my now fiancee and she's pretty fucking amazing.

Some of the best/ funniest parts are the times the 2 love birds got shitfaced and spent an hour trying to make a pizza in the oven while I sat back and watched. 

Or the time the couch guy had his girlfriend stay for the night and forgot she was staying there and got up to go to work in the morning but took her car.

It turns out he was telling me about his dad passing away from a heart attack a few days before. It was soon before Christmas, and because I understood the words ""my uncles, my cousins, the whole family"", I thought he was talking about Christmas Eve. Never did I think he was talking about his family gathering for his dad's funeral. Utterly horrible and embarrassing moment.

He sorta raises his hand up in this Fuck Yeah! pose.

Apparently he grew up near Stamford Bridge in Fulham, and was a massive fan since birth. Throughout the entire set he'd just say CHELSEA! to me and Ben Davis would just shake his head in mock dismay.

Shit like that is why I loved that crew.


It's crazy considering Ben was the cinematographer for little known films like Guardians of the Galaxy. Doctor Strange. Age of Ultron. Kickass. And Peter was first AD for shit like La La Land. Birdman. Like all the Pirates of the Caribbean. Really cool chaps."

3117,"So this is something I learned while I was at the culinary school in Amatrice (before the earthquake), a little town in the mountains about 2h east of Rome that has produced many of the Popes' chefs throughout the centuries: for a true carbonara, use pecorino romano, not parmigiano reggiano. It's nuttier and saltier than parmesan and just makes the dish so much more complex in flavour. You can actually substitute pecorino in most Italian recipes you'll find that call for parmesan and it will just improve the dish. Try it in pesto! (Even though pesto is technically from Genoa - I think - and was originally made with parmesan)

As for my own culture (french canadian), just make sure you use homemade fries (twice-fried, none of that frozen stuff), rich thin gravy, and motherf*cking cheese CURDS (Satan have you if you use shredded) in your poutine.

But Quebec cuisine is actually about way more than just poutine. Try finding a true Lac St-Jean tourti√®re recipe (with chunks of game meats, not just ground beef and pork), or a pouding ch√¥meur recipe. It's poor people food, but it's tasty as hell. And of course, next time you make breakfast, make sure to more than generously drizzle it in 100% Qu√©bec maple syrup, the darker the better."

3127,"This is a very interesting issue. I used to be strongly pro fission but I've since changed my mind to a more neutral sentiment. The biggest problem with fission power in my opinion isn't nuclear meltdowns or the radioactive waste, it's the politics and economics surrounding a nuclear powerplant.

The big problem is that nuclear power plants are too good--they produce so much money that corruption is rampant and innovation is staunched. Scientists have shown that it's possible to make fission reactors that are much safer than current ones (like Thorium Salt reactors) and there's ways to get rid of the radioactive waste. The problem is just that when the infrastructure was built, governments and private industries cut corners and used sub optimal reactor designs (most current reactors  are based off designs originally developed for submarines) and sub optomal waste storage options. 

In summary, fission power is great and it's possible to do it extremely safely and dispose the waste effectively, however, greed caused corners to be cut and innovation to be held back resulting in today's situation. "

3129,"I agree, though I would expand that to the vilification of GMOs as a whole.

I'm not down with stuff like making seeds artificially unable to be replanted, so you have to buy seed from the company every year.

But genetic modification is both extraordinarily helpful and extraordinarily common.

The tomatoes in my backyard are genetically modified, because over many many years, people have selected for particular traits. I like the ones that value taste over hardiness or shape.  Other tomatoes are preferred for other traits. But we all got to those kinds of tomatoes by tweaking their genetics.

As for lab-selected (rather than naturally- or field-selected) plants, the point remains. If there's a genetic tweak that can make a higher yield crop or make it resistant to disease, that feeds more people. That's fantastic. Or maybe it requires less fertilizer so there is less pollution runoff. Also great.

It seems like people who are entirely against GMOs are scared of it being some sort of dangerous additive, like you said. But a little scientific literacy (or just critical thinking) makes it a lot less spooky."

3147,"Back in 2002 (just a few months after 9/11), a woman was randomly selected for additional screening at the security line in the airport in Washington, D.C.  She was not amused and went off.  She was horribly insulted in a deeply personal way, and she yelled dreadful, hateful things that echoed down the corridors about why she should not be chosen if *that* person or *this* person who allegedly looked like *real* terrorists were not.  She would not accept that she was selected at random.  So rather than walking back through the metal detector and having the security agent wave a wand around her for a couple minutes, she freaked out and gummed up the security line for everybody for fifteen minutes.

My  husband and I looked at each other, and we each said, ""I hope she's not on our flight.""

Well, of course she was on our flight, and directly across the aisle next to us.  She did not calm down, though she did stop yelling.  She sat there fuming.  When the flight attendants came by with the beverage cart, she ordered a cup of ice and as much alcohol as they'd allow.  She went on to spend the next two time zones in the air mixing mini-martinis with one hand and counting rosary beads with the other, quietly cursing between gulps of booze."

The good news is a derm knows what to *do* with those descriptions and what they could mean. Remember, skin type isn't a perfect science or static state. For instance, I am slightly oily on my chin, nose and hairline, but normal elsewhere. I also had an issue with what I thought was *dry* skin, but actually ended up being dehydrated (cause I wasn't using enough moisturizer or drinking enough water). So your derm may do a questionnaire,  tissue test, etc, but so much of finding a skincare solution is trial and error. Like the ""sensitive skin"" stuff. That usually means, ""we've removed the extra ingredients that the majority of people are sensitive to"" but while one person is sensitive to a particular fragrance oil, you may be reacting to the emulsifier. It helps to keep a list of what you have tried and how you reacted and it can help to narrow down specific sensitivities. 

Full disclosure, not a derm, just spent a lot of time figuring out my face.

3176,"I have read about 40 true crime books.  There is one attempted murder that has always stayed with me as the strangest.

Richard Ramirez, the night stalker, waited outside a womans house, hiding in the bushes.  She pulled her car in the garage and sat for a moment.  As she pressed the button to close the garage and exited her car, she turned to see Richard duck inside and point a pistol at her.  Right when he was about to shoot, the garage door closed all the way.  The light was burnt out so the garage was suddenly pitch black.  Richard shot right as the dark closed on them, striking the womans keys she brought up in her hand to shield her face.

She fell to the ground, Richard stepped over her, walked inside, shot and killed her roommate, then left out the front door.  As he was leaving, he saw the woman exiting out of the now opened garage.  They made eye contact and he said something like, ""I thought I just killed you?"" and walked off.

To this day every time I shut my garage I imagine that unlikely series of events.  What a trip.  Saved by a set of keys and a burned out lightbulb."

&gt;Gypsies only interact with you to steal from you. Kids are the worst. Believing anything else is delusional. 

Maybe the reason you think this is because all the decent Roma people you've come across don't fit your stereotype of being criminals?

When I was in Romania (almost 10% of the population are Roma) for a couple weeks a few years ago I came across hundreds of Roma people and pretty much every interaction I had was positive.

3263,"One time when i was skiing with my dad, a company was giving out free samples of their protein milk shit. It came in 3 flavors, which were chocolate, strawberry, and banana. I decided to get chocolate and my dad got strawberry. That was some damn good chocolate milk, and my dad said it was some damn good strawberry milk. We let each other try the other flavor, and i personally didn't like the strawberry milk a lot, probably partly due to my elementary school serving strawberry milk that was stringy and chunky on occasion, so i had some bad memories of the shit. By the time i got home i was fucking exhausted. I took a shower, ate dinner which was some korean food that i had ate many times before, and then went to bed an hour or two later. Something wasn't sitting right in my stomach, so i went to the bathroom. It was about midnight when this happened, but i puked fucking everywhere. I just kept on spewing the shit out. Once i finished, i flushed it all and went back to bed after having cleaned myself up a bit. My stomach decided that we werent getting any sleep though, and it hurt like hell. 30 minutes later, i got up and puked in the bathroom again. I couldn't believe there was anything left, but i managed to push out whatever i had. I went back to sleep after doing the same thing over again, and after maybe 15 minutes of laying down holding my stomach i fell asleep, only to be waken up 15 minutes later to puke even more. I don't fucking know how, but that shit came out again, although far less of it. By this time, my throat burned and my chest hurt too from gagging and puking a ton. Rinse and repeat, dry heaving at the toilet just to spit up some mucus every 30-40 minutes until 5 in the morning. I finally fell asleep for good. I woke up at 8 with zero energy. I walked my way over to the bathroom, puked again, and then spewed a liquid of equal consistency to my puke out my backside. I had apparently also sharted in my underwear, and was so fucking done. There was no fucking toilet paper. I no longer gave any shits. My parent should be at work, and my sister at school, so i walked into the nearby storage room and got toilet paper and cleaned myself off and went straight back to sleep. Slept for a solid 3 hours before being woken up by my mom. Apparently my sister was also sick and my mom stayed home because we were sick. Got up, puked again, and then took a shower. I could hardly stand, let alone wash myself for the 10 minutes i spent in the shower. Nearly passed out on the walk back to bed. Slept for another 5 hours, but drank a shit ton of water and some gatorade too whenever i would wake up for a couple minutes. Woke up, dry heaved at the toilet for a bit, and got up for good.

You seem like a very positive person. I am sure you will find a good partner.

&gt; It's kind of interesting that there is no parallel female incel movement now that I think about it. 

That is because according to incel ideology there are no female incels. Being an incel is not about NOT being able to find a **fitting** sexual partner that you are **attracted** to but not being able to get laid **at all**. So even the fact, that you are able to get laid with that creepy old dude that might be dangerous for you, disqualifies you as an incel. Which might sound silly from your point of view, but is important for men that define their self-worth based on who they can get laid with.

Of course, in reality, woman can be lonely as well and I don't think it is very wise to play ""who has its worse"". The struggle is different. BUT I do think, that there is a higher percentage of male struggling. I think woman tend to care more about personality (or maybe they have to, because they have to at least make sure he is not dangerous) and many man fall through this filter. Plus most of the time men are expected to be the ""chaser"" in our society which is also harder if you have low self-esteem. So while incel theory is bullshit, I think there are indeed some more male-specific struggles.

&gt; I guess I was involuntarily celibate until 24

Damn, I would be interested to hear that story.

&gt; Anyways, maybe I'm misinterpreting what you said here, but it sounds like you feel like there's no hope for you to ever have a relationship or maybe even just sex.

I am 27-year old. Men only get more attractive until they are 35, plus the competition gets smaller because most men are after the 18-25 bracket, so I am not totally hopeless. I just don't expect anything to happen but if I keep working on myself, getting at least laid one day **might** happen. On the other hand, that is like the easiest part, forming a healthy romantic relationship with another human being is when the trouble starts. ;)

Edit: I was wrong to say ""Men only get more attractive until they are 35"". Maybe more like ""Men ripe like fine wine"" or maybe that goes for both men and women, would be cool. :)

3351,"Having multiple things you could potentially talk about, people are all different not everyone is going to be interested in your main interests.

Learn to read your conversation partner. Plenty of people won't outright say they're bored, but it's pretty obvious after some time to notice lack of enthusiasm even if someone is going through the motions, if that's the case change the subject or ask something about them.

Encourage them to speak more and don't just let them speak so you can say your next thing, listen so you can try to say something to continue the conversation. I find if I have something in common with someone I mention things that imply I know about the topic. If I don't then I try to get them to tell me more, if it's interesting I keep coaxing more out of them and playing to their enthusiasm or focus on the topic, if I'm not interested I try and transition topics through other things they mention.

Try and steer away vague questions that invite one word responses when talking to someone new. This is a big one I find is an issue with some, asking questions like ""How are you?"" or ""Tell me about yourself"". Most people will generally reply with ""I'm doing well"" because they'd rather not have you in their business and you have no place to go. With ""tell me about yourself"" you're asking for a broad overview of someone, generally most people won't know what to say when confronted with that question. Instead if you feel it's right ask questions about things you'd feel comfortable sharing about yourself like hobbies, work, or entertainment. 

All of this advice isn't an ace in the hole to have a good conversation, but it's a good start to keep in mind, if you really want to work on your conversing skills, but have anxiety about it try talking to people online. I generally am always interested in talking to most strangers and a lot of good friends I have I met online.

3489,"I was a grad student TA in engineering helping the prof go over the final marks after the exam. We were going through the grades to make sure things were graded consistently and with a reasonable bell curve. If we found a student who failed with about 49% or 48% we would go through the exam/mid-term/labs to see if we couldn't be generous and give them that one extra mark here or there to let them pass. 

Until we got to two girls in the class who were at 40% and 38% respectively and the Prof bumped them up to a pass. I looked at him and said ""really?. He was this old gruff tenured prof who usually had no time for nonsense so I was a bit taken aback. He leaned back in his chair said, and I'm going to quote because I won't ever forget it:

&gt; Let me just say this. There are certain people who if you fail them the administration will make trouble for you.

And then he gave me the ""do you understand what I'm trying to tell you"" look. 

That's how I found out about the engineering department's unofficial affirmative action policy. I would later learn that there were lots of other tricks like this to help *certain people*, but that first time you see it in action is a real shocker. The sad part is these students didn't ask for a grade bump, they didn't ask for special treatment, and to this day most probably have no idea this was happening. "

Currently struggling with this.

Working in a small office where most of my work is customer-facing, but I was also doing a lot of filing work too. Most of the filing is accumulated by a notoriously lazy co-worker that the boss is afraid to discipline to do anything. She almost never helps with customers and acts pretend-busy most of the day at a non-customer-facing desk.

Recently, our opening hours to the public increased by over an hour per day, leaving me with very little non-customer time. This meant that the files of lazy co-worker had accumulated near her desk. So she tells the boss the filing needs to be done (that I need to do it), and he tells me to get to it as soon as possible. I strongly disagreed and said that wasn't fair, and he got angry and said he'd 'do it himself'. 

So now I'm in the doghouse because he's afraid to ask the lazy co-worker to actually do some work, and I'm not bending over backwards to fit even more work into my day.

But the Bush Administration immediately turned its eyes on Iraq, and while the population was still looking for blood for 9/11 and people started to conflate the two or blame Sadam for the attack, it was absolutely part of their strategy not to correct or publicly set the record straight.

I can't tell you how many times I would be arguing with people about Iraq and they would bring up their attack on the WTC as justification. There were even people who said ""well, someone has to pay for it"" (I really, REALLY recall Howard Stern saying this, but it's been a long time and I may be misremembering).

The Bush government did as little as possible to separate Iraq from 9/11, because they knew doing so would lessen the support for the invasion.

Men were more likely to take for granted that they should have/get what they want/try for, but more arrested in their emotional development. But that's just men I dated or hooked up with in my twenties (married a pansexual woman in my thirties), so I don't know what that would tell you about men generally vs. young me. What I mean by that is they were more likely to not want to work on their relationship with their emotions- more likely to sulk in the face of disappointment, avoid confrontation or responsibilities, try to stay comfortable all the time, less like to grow their abilities in empathy and communication, etc. Lots of Peter Pans, guys who didn't love themselves or work on their self image and confidence, etc but again I was only in my 20s (the guys were all ages, but probably mostly within a few years of me).


Women were less likely to have a healthy attitude towards putting themselves first- across all situations. Often this meant they needed some gentle encouragement to habitually put themselves first, and occasionally it meant pushing too hard, taking too much- the inverse of the same problem.

The first time I saw it I had nightmares and I was afraid/ashamed to tell anyone about them. So, the next year when it came on I went into the other room and watched a hockey game on the little black and white tv. Now, we were close enough to Canada to get a few Canadian stations so it was probably good hockey with real, live Canadian announcers. But, the important thing is I didn't have to watch the Wizard of Oz and I didn't have nightmares. And I learned I kinda enjoyed watching hockey. I didn't watch the Wizard of Oz again until I was in college. Fortunately it didn't give me nightmares."

The elementary school burned down a decade prior, and it was replaced by trailer houses that leaked. 

The alternative school had a low acceptance rate and was sharing facilities with the high school.

The school board was 80% parents who had kids in the alternative school. 

We got them all off the board, got the funds diverted to a new elementary school, and in the end found the money to also build a new building for the alt school.

Everyone won. No one goes to school in a moldy building, now."

From what I remember she ran a really high fever and they couldnt bring it down no matter what they did.  Eventually she went into a coma and died. I dont think they ever figured out what was wrong with her or anything.  I remember being really sad when I heard about it.  She was a year or two older than me so she always treated me like alittle brother or something.(she was an only child)  Her female cousin, who was an only child too, was my age and we were closer as friends.  I think her cousin liked me as more than a friend but Im gay so I really didnt reciprocate those feelings. lol

All that does is create more of a race divide and hurt potential solutions. If a white person has an idea of how to deal with issues concerning underprivileged children of color they should share and if it's a decent idea it should be looked into. Same with the opposite. 

Also white people can still be poor.  So they can have valid insights into this issue. Yes they may not face the same exact biases and issues, but putting their input ""in the back seat"" is counter productive in my opinion."

Still, as creepy as that was, the dead body was the worst. 

Several months into the stay, I (against my parents wishes) creeped into a room on the 2nd floor and found a dead body floating in a tub. She was blubbery, her skin water-logged and sagging off her bones. I screamed to my parents about it, but they didn't understand. I'm not even sure they saw the body, to be honest.

How will hospitals be funded? Is this funding realistic? What standards will they have to maintain before funding is cut or they are shut down?

3875,"Ooh this still gives me the creeps. I lived out in the countryside with my grandmother one summer, probably around age 14 or 15. My grandma went to work as usual, and I stayed home with the dog.

For some reason, I went outside and decided to prop the screen door open while I was gone. I went to the back of the house toward the pool and our garden shed, our old dog trotting along beside me. As I was making my way back to the house, I heard a car pull up our driveway, which made me stop in my tracks. There shouldn't have been anyone coming at that moment, as we living pretty far into the wilderness and someone would have told me if they were coming over. I listened as carefully as I could, trying to make out a voice or something.

The person got out of their car and began to walk. I remembered I had left the door open and mentally kicked myself, hoping that the person wouldn't just go into my house.

""Hello?"" came the voice of an older man. I immediately pressed myself against the side of the house and tried to decide what to do. I was anxiety ridden and paranoid, so there was no way I was going to let this strange man find me, alone, vulnerable.

""Anybody home?"" he called. I heard him take a couple of steps up our creaking steps, so I booked it, and hid out inside the shed. The dog wouldn't follow me in, so I hoped if this guy was a serial killer or something, he wouldn't go after a senior dog.

I peeked out in the dusty broken window to see if he had come around the side of the house, and eventually he did. He was an older guy, balding, wearing a huge coat even though it was summer. He noticed my dog and bent down to pet him. (As a 15 year old dog, he was pretty mellow.)

The guy walked around the property some more, checking out the pool, looking into our car port at my late great grandfather's old car, and eventually peering into a few of our windows. He got back into his car maybe ten minutes later and, for some reason, he honked the horn. After maybe 30 seconds of no response, he honked again, and this happened maybe three more times. 

I don't know when exactly he left, but 30 minutes later, still terrified, I left the shed and carefully entered the house, holding a garden shovel as I made my way through the rooms. Still not feeling safe, I called my grandma and told her about it, and she got my aunt to come over and sit with me until she got home. They theorized it was a guy interested in the old car, but I wasn't sure. Why had he been so adament about it? Why did he look in our windows?

The whole situation gives me the creeps even 6 years later. I think it led to me being deathly afraid of home invasion."

3881,"My mom was a bit like this, but it wasn't even amnesia - she had no idea that she was being awful *literally while she was being awful.* I remember once she called me (while I was away at university) and yelled at me for 20 minutes without letting me say a word because *she* hadn't told me that my extended family was coming this weekend and she expected me to be home for the whole weekend instead of coming by for just our usual Sunday dinner (which, by the way, I was fine with doing once I knew that my extended family was coming, but I didn't get a chance to actually say that because she wouldn't stop fucking *yelling*). 

Once she got it all out of her system, she hung up the phone, turned to my dad, and literally said, ""Well, I think I handled that pretty well!"" Like, she knew we all thought she was inclined towards those kinds of inappropriate outbursts of anger, and sort of recognized that she'd done it in the past, but she genuinely thought her behaviour in that moment was acceptable. It was absolutely insane.

Then I tried to talk to her about it during the weekend, face-to-face, and it never mattered what I said or how I tried to explain that it wasn't okay, she refused to admit that maybe yelling at your adult daughter for something *you* haven't told her is fucking ridiculous. The conversation basically ended up with me saying that it didn't matter if she didn't get it, if she ever did it again, I would hang up on her immediately. She cried a bunch, but I don't know what else I'm supposed to do with that shit."

The hell he gave his parents (he was quite a handful growing up!), etc.



I'm sorry that it was kept so secret and that your family feels ashamed. I feel lucky that even though this was in a time of turmoil for the gay community and the time of the AIDs crisis, I feel like I was given an opportunity to grow up with a more open mindset than many people.

I walked into his room to get my Xbox controller back at about 4am and he was laying on the floor white as a ghost with a belt around his arm and the needle was still in. The plunger of the needle got pulled out when he fell so blood was squirting a perfect line straight out of his arm. I grabbed the syringe and threw it, took the belt off and he was taking about 3-5 breaths a minute then after a few minutes while trying to find my phone to call 911 his breathing returned to normal but he was unable to wake up. The next evening he was finally able to get up and walk around and returned to his normal self. 

He always claimed it was a accident and just overdid it that night but just recently he admitted he was trying to end it. That happened back in 2010 and wasn't the only time he had ever ODed. He is now been sober for years, engaged,  has his own house and 3 future step children."

He had two positions in his work history: an internship and a part-time job. Most information in his work history focused on his grocery stocking position from just senior year of high school. He had an internship, for a semester, junior year, but that had only two vague bullet points of info. His grocery list had no less than 8 overlapping, SAT-word-loaded praises for his own skills as a grocery stocker - ""excelled at exhibiting total responsibility for industrial processing of inventory"" or stuff like that. We laughed for about 10 minutes while passing it around the department before it went in the trash.

So, lesson: try to have relevant work history (I know) and focus on the relevant work history based on the job you're applying to. I used to have 5 versions of the same resume that were adjusted to different industries (""aerospace"" versus ""thermodynamics,"" etc.) We didn't even want to pass that guy's resume down for an internship because of the total lack of awareness he demonstrated.

If you don't know, Bob Newhart stared in two extremely popular and completely unrelated sitcoms. The finale of the second one ended with him waking up in bed in the set of the first one, complete with the first sitcom's wife. Implying the entire second sitcom was nothing more than a dream.

This was a time before memes or metajokes. The sheer balls to try something like that for the finale of your popular show is amazing.

4023,"Not Middle Eastern but Indian. The shopping experience, even for the middle class, is completely different in Asian countries. For one, the second you walk in, there's usually a salesperson that follows you around and asks you if you need any help (kind of like a Lush in America, if you're familiar). It's very personal and a culture shock coming back to American commerce. In addition, Asian/Middle Eastern culture is just generally louder and more of a 'survival of the fittest' vibe. "

4058,"My understanding is that ""health tourists"", while heavily reported by the Daily Mail and suchlike, are in reality so rare that their impact is effectively irrelevant on an organisation the size of the NHS.

The point about immigrants is not that they pay more in total, it's that they use far less. On average, costs for healthcare and other fax-funded services (especially education) are highest for children and the elderly. Economic migrants come as (usually healthy) adults and often retire back to their home countries when they stop working. This means the UK pays much less in social benefits while still benefitting from their tax income while they're working."

It was the top comment in the post and gilded multiple times, but when the mods found it they were so butthurt that they removed it and the entire comment chain after it.  Imagine that, the only funny shit in that garbage sub and it ended up getting censored because it didn't fit their propaganda."

4076,"You know, I get that it's fun to say stupid things, even things that might shock or offend people. Hell, I actually rather like shock humour. But you must understand there is a time and a place for it, and to target it at specific people doesn't make you funny by any measure, you just have a negative interaction. 

I fully realise you are going to respond to this with a meme or just try to insult me or whatever, and that's fine. Just know you could enjoy yourself a lot more, and perhaps even help others enjoy themselves, if you were more open to constructive and positive intereractioms online. We all have to share the internet, we all have to share the world, and there's enough negativity in both that being nice is a rebellious act.

4083,"Caviar is harvested from female fish *before* the eggs are laid, which means you have to kill the fish. Beluga caviar comes from a type of sturgeon. Those take about 7 years to mature and produce the maximum amount of eggs. The fish can only thrive in a specific climate. Yeah, caviar seems overpriced, but to care for a large amount of fish in such a controlled, yet natural environment for so long costs a decent amount of money"

4089,"I made my own granola once because I mistakenly thought making it myself would be cheaper. Turns out, buying each ingredient (and there are a lot) individually in the right quantity is about 5 times more expensive than the box of premade granola.

4099,"Teenagers are fine. Their parents, the other teachers, and the morons in supervisory roles make the job very difficult. 

Treat teenagers with respect and you WILL get it back. They are taken aback by simple understanding and communication that adults tend to deny them. If you treat them well, they will actually self manage one another. One guy acts a fools and everyone tells him off for you. Ideally you don‚Äôt have this with good management in the room, but kids have bad days so sometimes it‚Äôs unavoidable. Sticking around in a community also helps. 

When you asked to get into my class, and your brother/sister/aunt told you to take me and nobody else, then you automatically have more invested there. I have had a parent laugh at my new assistant principal because he was questioning my classroom approach. She was like ‚ÄúI know you are new, but everyone fights to get into his class. We know his work is challenging.‚Äù Strong community support is key to teaching anywhere. Some places it‚Äôs impossible to find, but you can usually find support somewhere."

4111,You are an amazing person.
4112,"Damn, that made what I did seem safe in comparison. I told my parents I was going to a convention in another city 3 hours away with some friends. The truth is I hitched a ride with some fellow volunteers (free entrance and bed to sleep on) that I hadn't met before they showed up at my door. I got lucky and ran into some classmates who gave me a ride back. My original travel companions decided to stay an extra day for a staff party I was unable to attend because I was underage. I can't believe my parents let me go. I don't remember calling them to check in throughout the weekend either. I have a baby girl now and would be freaking out if she does this in 19 years."

4114,"My girlfriend got one put in about a year and some change ago that lasts 5 years. She said it was definitely uncomfortable to have put in, but wow, sex is out of this world when you don‚Äôt have to worry about any precautions. I forget which one it is, and idk if it has hormones or not. It did seem to raise her already fairly high labido, and apparently it does something to the the fetus I think, where even if you do fall into that .x% you have to have the doctor remove it anyway because it‚Äôll be worthless anyhow. Idk, been having sex 3-6 times a week on average for about a year and I have nothing but positives. She doesn‚Äôt bleed NEARLY as much either, but that didn‚Äôt start until just recently.

Edit: She said it‚Äôs called Kyleena"

4119,"I know this is off the point, but I just want to point out that *a million* years is a ridiculously long time. A million years ago, *Homo sapiens* hadn‚Äôt even evolved to our current form. Language development is an order of magnitude more rapid than biological evolution; we have trouble deciphering English written a thousand years ago. In a million years, it‚Äôs highly unlikely that any trace of the language remains at all."

4125,"I get sleep paralysis when I sleep on my back. It is the absolute worst feeling waking up. You can feel your heart racing but cannot move any of your muscles, not even turn your head. I'll attempt to yell but no words will come out. The fact that you can't turn your head and are still partially asleep makes you wonder what is holding you down and sets in panic mode.

4134,"This entire thread is crazy for missing things that have already happened. These same conversations happened when the television came out. Technology has always changed society and it will continue to do so.

Cars, Television and now social media and the internet. It goes back even farther if you consider science and religion. Hell people use to worry back in the day what would happen if women were allowed to vote or own land! Now you might think that is different but it really is not. People really though that letting women and blacks vote would change and maybe hurt the world. It did change the world but it was not ""bad"".

People adapt and change. Yes social media has already changed us and it will continue to do so. But tons of people are already giving it up. Myself included outside of anon reddit posts.

Calm down people this is normal.

4136,This might be the most extreme. Its definitely up there.
4137,The so called ‚Äúinternet of things‚Äù baffles me. Seems like something absolutely no one asked for but is being foisted on us anyway.

4138,Especially if it‚Äôs Catholic camp
4139,"I was watching Scream 4 for the first time, you know the telescoping 'movie within a movie within a movie' bit? Where the phone rings in each movie? It got to the end of that sequence and the house phone rang in real life and I nearly shat myself thinking ghostface was gonna gank me."

4142,"not like a shower can catch fire, just stay in there and you'll be fine (dont do this)"
4143,"The third point is very relatable.  I work with a guy who is the son of a large corporation CEO.  Aside from having zero debt at 23, you'd never think he was loaded.  He'll just casually drop how his dad has a massive boat and houses all over the country, or how he always uses first class flights.  But other than that you'd never think twice.

4156,"I'm black and live in the southern US. It's just not something you talk about. Also i feel like in general people just don't talk about HIV enough. Sure we talk about prevention and all that but no one typically talks about their personal struggles or issues related to it. 

There's alot more I could go into. I try not to think about it too much because it's all very depressing and makes me so angry  at my family. Years ago one of my closer aunts confided most of the story to me about how it all went down. It's something I should probably see a therapist for but ::shrug::."
4157,"Focus on the fact that it's your life at stake. Tell people that you've decided to try and gain a bit of weight, because you've realised that it's not good to be so light. If they get extremely nasty, cut them out of your life if they won't change after you talk to them.

4179,"Got dumped by my partner of 3 years. No warning, no leadup. No opportunity to talk it out. Just ""I want to break up.""

I was calm at first because I thought SURELY he wasn't serious. I trusted and EXPECTED him to be a bit more open with me if there was a problem - not just run away. That's what I would have done for him.

Once I realised he was serious I just... broke.
I wanted to marry this guy. I had NO issues with our life together. I felt disassociated from reality. Time meant nothing. My skin ws wrong on my body - twisted and warped. My fingertips tingled and my chest felt hollow. My head was buzzing and silent at the same time. My heart hurt so bad. I couldn't focus. I LEGITIMATELY believed I was dreaming. I kept expecting to wake up tomorrow and everything would be ok. I kept counting my fingers to make sure I had five on each hand - apparently in dreams the number is often wrong. I needed to be sure. I legitimately lost my ability to tell reality from nightmares for a moment. The shock was too great.

That was my 'what the fuck' moment."

4200,"A ""meme"" is an intentionally emulated behavior. 

Memes come in a variety of different forms and formats, but the thing that makes each one a meme is the imitated action. Communicating via image macros with previously agreed-upon subtexts is a meme. Planking was a meme. The act of Rickrolling someone is a meme... but the video itself is just a video.

Memes *are not* screenshots of tweets, webcomics, context-free image macros, or anything else of that nature. This isn't a case where the meaning of the word can evolve, either, since ""meme"" refers to a specific phenomenon for which there is no other term. Sure, misuse might be more common than correct use nowadays, but the myth that popular use defines correctness ‚Äì especially in this case ‚Äì doesn't hold much water.

Remember back in the nineties, when everyone used ""schizophrenia"" to mean ""dissociative identity disorder?"" *That* didn't change the correct meaning of the word, just like the correct meaning of ""meme"" won't change. Before much longer, we'll probably see a swing back to people understanding what memes actually are... and at that point, I'll happily state that I never went along with the trend of misusing the word.

Also, no, misusing the word ""meme"" isn't a meme, because most people aren't doing it intentionally.

**TL;DR: I refuse to use the word ""meme"" to mean ""something I saw on the Internet.""**"

My roommate and his dad (who owns the property, and used to live in the upstairs apartment) opened the car to clear it out.  


in the back there was a blanket covering something. This  something was a garbage can that was sealed shut with tar. inside was a tarp wrapped around something. And then another blanket. And when they cut it open, they discovered a dismembered body. Then police were called.  


The investigation took a long time, but turns out the old tenant murdered his wife like 15 years ago, and she had no contact with anyone outside of him, so no one really noticed.  


The best part of it is when the police showed up, and asked who the owner of the car was, one of the officers knew him by name and was just like, ""dammit, not him again."""

* Saw something about a temple(?) in India that gives out free food. Would want to bring that idea elsewhere, especially in areas with a lot of poverty. But I would want it to be someplace public and normal feeling, free to everyone. Open design - like a big food stall - where anyone can just walk up and get a meal. No shame.  

* Non-degree educational classes - including adult re-education classes. Pretty building so it feels inspiring, not some grungy, old, back alley building. There could be some classes always offered (like basic computer use/internet, math, etc) and some rotating classes and workshops. Basic carpentry, for fun history classes, personal finance, mythology, underwater basic weaving, whatever. Could attract a variety of people. Some people who dropped out of school and now need to re-learn English. Some people who want to  take a workshop on basic calligraphy, but don't want to go to college for it. Also includes a library and study space.

* Human + Animal rehabilitation center. Take at risk/bad attitude kids and pair them with an animal that was abused and is in recovery. The animals will stay at a facility, the kids will come a few times a week, like a job. This gets them out of their neighborhood. Maybe each kid gets assigned to one animal and is responsible for it during their working days. Feeding, changing bandages, etc. Pay them, like a part time job. They get job experience, they get to see what violence does to others, they get a feeling of responsibility, they get a friend who doesn't judge them. They are responsible for helping to rehabilitate the animal enough that it can be adopted out. The facility will also have a lounge/study space in case the kids don't have a home life that allows for easy studying. 

Everyone who works for me will be paid above average for their position, and will get generous time off. Maybe four day work week for full time and three day work week for part time. Or maybe normal 5 day work weeks, but with rotating extra days off every month. "

If you're easily upset by animal cruelty, I wouldn't read it if I were you. I came across this a few months ago when researching Traditional Chinese Medicine. It's such a horrific and disturbing practice, even more so when you read that these bile bear farms are legal in China (although the government has imposed restrictions on them, they are rarely enforced). I read this article a few months ago and I still think of it quite often. The level of animal cruelty made an impact on me. Perhaps not quite as disturbing as some of these articles, but still horrific."

Doing that is the next level, but I would kinda feel bad taking people's precious stuff. I know that growing up, we lost a lot of priceless things in storage because my father would end up in jail and we wouldn't be able to pay. I wouldn't want to do that to someone. But then, it's either I buy it or someone throws it in the trash and no one ever appreciates any of it again. Maybe I'll do that at one point."

4341,"This would make total sense, but I had almost the same thing happen to me one time. In our old house, we had a sunroom. The dining room window looked out into the sunroom. At this time, I was working the grave shift. I would normally go to bed with my husband until he fell asleep, then I‚Äôd stay up playing on my phone or doing whatever. One night after he was asleep, I went into the sunroom to have a cigarette. I was playing on my phone as usual, and saw him peek his head from the right side of the window. He had no shirt on, just like when he sleeps, so I figured he had woken up and was getting my attention before he came to smoke. I saw it out of the corner of my eye. Then I watched him do it 2 more times, both times I was staring at the kitchen window. On the third time, I laughed and asked if he was going to join me or what. I saw it again, and this time I ran into the house through the garage. It was a short distance, and coming in that way, I had a full view of the kitchen, living room, and hallway. He was gone. I ran into the bedroom and he was sound  asleep. I was freaked the fuck out so I woke up up and asked if he was fucking with me. He had no idea what I was talking about. My husband and I can‚Äôt fuck with each other and keep a straight face about it, so I knew he was asleep the whole time.

Second, there are activists (Jessica Valenti is one), who are pushing to change the way rape is adjudicated even in criminal courts. The proposal is that consent would be an affirmative defense like claiming ""self defense"" in a murder case.

Sometimes you don't know which bit in the process you're getting wrong: e.g. you think you're following a ritual, but when it's observed, the ritual isn't actually tight enough. Or mom and dad thought they were doing the same ritual but it's actually different when closely observed. Or whether you go in or not depends on whether the baby's cry is one way or the other and reading a textual description isn't enough to hear the difference. Or maybe you need an expert to actually observe the child's behavior to see if they are testing boundaries or actually distraught. Or maybe your kid has constipation issues and you don't know what to do when they're complaining about stomach aches during bedtime but no book seems to address this. Etc etc.

Plus, if you have a kid that doesn't sleep, you will be ridiculously exhausted after a few months. Maybe you went on four hours sleep a night for a couple of weeks during finals. But three months turns you into a complete zombie. You can't concentrate to read more than a page of a book.

Then, he ended up spilling a whole shelf of paints on another car, denting the door panel and ruining the paintjob we already put on it. Finally, he asked why the only thing he was trusted to do was sweep floors, and upon explaination of the severity of his fuck ups, he said the magic words to my boss, ""why don't you get rid of me then?""

Right click on a tile puts a flag on it.  
Right click on a flag replaces it with a question mark. Useful if you're unsure but don't want to forget there *might* be something there.  
Right click on a ? will turn the tile back to normal. Both the flag and ? disable left click (iirc), so you won't misclick them by accident.  

Look at corners first, it's the easiest way to find mines and flag them, because there are fewer possibilities.  
If you can't find where the mines are, try to find where they *can't* be. If a 1 tile already has a mine spotted, you can click all other tiles surrounding it without any fear. If you have 2 mines flagged around a 1 tile, there's a mistake somewhere.  
Big numbers like 3 and 4 look scary, but they're not. You often have fewer tiles to check, so if you use the surroundings you can find which one are or which one can't be mines.  
If you have a flat line, there's likely a pattern you can identify. Imagine the different configurations, you'll see some can't work and some are guaranteed."

I only *recently* learned that she thought most/all of this shit had to do with women.  Like I was gonna woo a girl or whatever the modern saying is for courting someone. Go on a date or skirt chase, ya know?

I only learned this *yesterday* because she asked me what I was doing, and I told her my weekend was gonna suck because I was getting 3 wisdom teeth pulled.  

She said, ""So no new dates this week.""

I said, ""Pretty much par for the course.""

She looked confused and responded, ""Aren't you on a date with a new girl like every week or something?""

""What?  No.""

""But didnt you say something about buying a girl something a few weeks ago?""

""I was talking about a video game character...""

""Oh shit...  I thought you were like going on tinder dates every week!  So you just play Xbox or whatever?""

Then she laughed and wished me luck at the dentist.  It was flattering though that she thought someone who looks like me has game.  I'm about to be a 24-year old virgin, for the record.  So my game doesn't really even exist.

EDIT: To everyone telling me I'm missing a clear shot, I'm gonna repeat here what I told them; I'm pretty sure she's just being nice and making small talk, for one, and even if that weren't the case, smoking cigarettes is a *major* deal breaker that I won't budge on.

Sorry to burst some people's bubbles, but maturity comes with experience, not with age. I've met teenagers and young adults who have a better head on their shoulders than some middle-aged adults. Age is just the amount of years you've been alive; it does not reflect the amount of experience you've had and/or the amount of wisdom you've gained. Age really is insignificant when measuring one's level of maturity since some people are wise beyond their years, while others are years behind mentally. I just think actual life experience, both good and bad, as well as first-hand knowledge about the hardships of life and how to overcome them are needed in order to really truly grow mentally. You don't just get declared mature and above all who are younger just because the fact you were alive for a certain amount of years and live on your own doing the same everyday mundane tasks/activities that all average adults have to do, that's not how it works."

When i moved into my current flat the previous occupents had lived there for about 5 years and the landlord wanted to do some renovations so there was at least 3 months if not more in between them leaving and us arriving. 

In our borough the council collect bins for food waste, recycling of all plastics and papers mixed together, and general rubbish. Well a few days after moving in i could smell something dodgy coming from the cabinet under the sink. After highlighting which cabinet it became apparent that the last tennants handt taken out their foodwaste bin when they left. There was months old rotten food in this bin. The entire thing was a brown liquid sludge and it reeked like nothing else i've ever smelt. Surrounded by mouse droppings. Had to peg my nose and sprint down the stairs with it in my hand to chuck the whole bin out. 

Took us months to get rid of the mice too. "

4700,"Was a flatout skeptic most of my life untill I ended up a addicted voilent lout. Me and my wife had seperated due to me bieng a full time man child. (Was injured in iraq in the sunni triangle because of a massive 600lb ied) so needless to say this era of my life was right after my release from the servive with a brain injury so i won't deny connections with that and acting foolish and or seeing things. HOWEVER my wife when meeting up with me when I lived on the streets would tell me I had a feeling of a black cloud that followed me. Never really thought anything about it till I was at a fellow druggies house out in the god damned boonies (southren kentucky) and we were getting ready to indulge in opiates like usual. I partake and start passing out, its late at night so my other friends were passed out as well. I wake up and cannot move, cant speak, just moans and whimpers with a overwhelming sense of doom and panic. I felt like something in a dark corner was wacthing and waiting to attack me. After a portion of time of struggling to make any noise or movement I did what any normal 7 year old would do and closed my eyes and hoped this would just pass and I wouldnt be devoured. Once I woke up im telling these fellow junkies my experince, I had never been through such a thing. Now its mid morning my buddys are drinking coffee and smokeing cigs and bullshitting keep in mind we are sober right now and its like 10:30 in the morning. We are also out in the hills of southern kentucky with the person next door liveing a mile or so more away. When a voice clear as the fucking day itself states "" GET OUT NOW!!!"" dude I shit you not we looked at each other in bewilderment all of us heard this command from somewhere in the house. Bieng good ole boys from the cut we try to investigate as we think maybe somebody is playing a prank. Nobody was around, we searched for a while. We left after we believed we had searched every logical place we could think of and I never returned. to this day it scares the shit outa me. Ive been clean since 2015 but that twist me up to this day. Shared delusions? Disembodied voice? Maybe a echco from somewhere far off? But why the sleep paralsys before? was it a mix of my TBI and drugs? Ive learned now that sound can vibrate in frequencys that manifest things to your eyes. I dont belittle people for things they see anymore, because basicly MUFON did a huge study on ufos and took data from many nations and people also video and photo evidence and came up with some figure like 95% of sightings are explainable but like 3-5% were utterly unexpainable. 3-5% of like 50,000 cases is still alot of unexplainable cases. Thats how I see this shit (paranormal stuffz), most of what people see and claim can be explained. But a few people have truely seen things that defy our current understanding of anything.  Maybe its like a dog looking at a computer screen, he sees the visual aspect but can never fathom the inner workings of the machine, "

Just take some rocket, heirloom tomatoes, ripe baby cucumbers and something sweet like a pomegranate or a couple of fresh peaches, dice them together as a salad.

In the mean time, roast the pumpkin with a salty glaze (miso works great!)

Once you've finished constructing the summer salad meticulously like a tiger mom should, shave that pumpkin like your emasculated husband!

Slice that cunt and place him right in the middle, a balsamic glaze (simply cook balsamic vinegar for a while and pretend you're a chef) or honey dressing (again, mix honey with vinegar and pretend you're a fucking big shot) will do.

Men will tell you when there is something really wrong. Women will brood on the little things until they're big things, there is always something wrong.

Men don't blame, once something is dealt with it's done. Women love blame and bring up things multiple times until they think it's done with.

I'll be honest though, I don't sleep with women anymore. Not because I'm gay, but because they're just too fucking hard to please. I've only ever loved women, but in the end it's just not worth it."

Later, after I've calmed down we'll re-evaluate the situation and between the two of us discussing it I can figure out where I went wrong if it was me being the problem. It happens sometimes.    
It takes a bit of personal responsibility to admit when you're wrong which took me a few years to figure out. If someone is unwilling to explore their faults then this tactic is fruitless.

Charles G. Jung if I remember right.   

He claims that ideas come to us all together, you only need to ""tap in"" to the system.    
e.g. Beethoven claimed that the music he made wasn't his, but got into his mind in some way.    This could be an explanation.

He also claimed that this could be the reason for people inventing exactly the same thing in different parts of the world without there being any communication between the two.    

It's an intersting train of thought, but it could also be total coincidence since generally scientists and inventors will improve upon existing information.   

Another thing he mentions is the ""100th monkey"" story, in which he claims that if enough people learn something, you could automatically self-learn it out of ""instinct"".

However this cop apparently had a hard on for me. At the criminal trial, my lawyer was told that since they had confiscated a fake id from me at the time of the arrest there was a possible new charge. If I didn't plead guilty to the DUI I would be facing felony forgery of a government document and under the patriot act I was looking at TIME.

Being kids we guessed everything but the reason...weight.  If they packaged chips in a bag just large enough to contain the amount of chips they were selling, no one would see a whole chip again.  "

4768,"In college I worked as an hourly manager for a large retail store - they're a competitor to Kohl's and basically sell the same stuff. Our store was in the top 5 grossing stores for the whole company, multi million dollars per year etc.

Every single Saturday, from 4pm until close I was the only manager there. All the assistant managers would have sat night off (and most of Sunday too), so it was left in my hands.

Saturdays are hands down the busiest days for the entire store, mostly because Canadians would come down to shop then go back across the border (they don't have to pay tax on clothes that way).  I'm sorry to say this about my northern neighbors, but holy shit they are the worst shoppers! They'd take a shirt off the rack, look it up and down, then toss it OVER the rack of other clothes! The store would always be filthy with clothes on wrong racks, clothes on the floor, paintings jammed in the shelves, and shoes/lighting fixtures/wall shelves would be opened and outside their boxes because the customer wants to ""see it"". 

The store closed at 9 or 10 but I'd have to keep the staff there until 1-2 am because we have to clean the store. This is because the managers would understaff Saturdays and overstaff the weekdays (so the night crew can clean the store faster on weekdays, ensuring that the managers closing on weekdays don't have to stay late)

Anyway, one Saturday we got absolutely slammed, way worse than any other Saturday. I called some managers for help, called in anyone I could, but I think only 2 hourly people showed up. One of the managers also decided Saturday evening was the perfect time to have a new hire start, so - since I was the only manager - I had to train her. I spent 10 minutes showing her the most basic thing before I got pulled away due to a customer requesting a manager. The store was so nuts I could barely train the new hire. Eventually, I ended up fighting fire after fire and I don't even remember seeing her again. Idk how long she stayed, or if she even clocked out. After close I had everyone plow through the departments one at a time. Come 3 am, the store was still DESTROYED. We got through maybe 60% of it, but it was 3 am and I said fuck it let's leave. The store was so bad, you couldn't even see the carpet of the shoes department because shoes were just tossed everywhere. 

I got written up the next day for how the store looked."

4789,"I'm 31 now. I quit gaming when I was 18. It was the best decision I ever made.

From the ages of about 13 - 18, I would sit at my computer playing Runescape, Tribes or Counter Strike against random people until 3 or 4 in the morning. I went to LAN meetups and when i wasn't playing the games, I was hanging out with the gamers on ICQ or forums. I enjoyed this (and I taught myself to code, which ultimately was very good for my career). But when I turned 18 I realised something had to change otherwise I could end up doing this for the rest of my life and it wasn't the lifestyle I wanted. I wanted to go out and meet real people, and if I was awake until 4am, i'd rather it would be at a party than on a game. Honestly it changed my life for the better. I changed my appearance (clothing, contact lenses etc) and really adopted a more outgoing personality. Or I could have sat at that computer with my clan buddies for the next 13 years and have none of the things I have now like a wife, house, awesome job, and a lifetime of memories.

This probably isn't the best place to knock gaming, but I think it's very dangerous for young men socially to get caught up in that lifestyle. It may seem like you have friends, but ultimately you're socially stunted and alone. I don't even have a computer or games console at home now. I don't ever want to get suckered back into that."

It's pretty sad, he had a kid about the same time he really went downward, I looked up to him, as a little brother does, even though he didn't want me around because I'm so much younger than him so he wasn't really nice... Now, the last couple years I was able to be around him there was a protective order against him, and I don't really want to talk to him because most of what he says is incoherent..."

I would do some molly or coke but never got down with the prescription pills like he did.  He would often take money off of what ppl owed him in exchange for pills.  One night I guess he took a bad combo of alcohol and different pills next morning his brother found him unconscious in the basement.  Well what has become of him is he is in a chair and is fully aware of what‚Äôs goin but cannot talk or move much at all can only make noises.  There‚Äôs 6 of us that are all good friends and still get beers with his dad or go over to see him when he‚Äôs not in his group home.  This all happened when we were 21 we‚Äôre all 26 now and you gotta think with us all doing well in our various careers getting married having kids I gotta think he sees this and wishes he was just dead at least I would because what he is is no way to live.

I‚Äôm just now coming out of a period of a little less than a decade of doing exactly that and it has damaged my mental well-being in more ways than I can describe. I‚Äôve had a few trips in the past year (some good, some horrific) but they‚Äôve all taught me something valuable. I cry a lot more now, but I also laugh and smile more too. Those are two things I largely didn‚Äôt do for months on end before these experiences. 

I would advise finding someone you trust to sit with you next time. Someone you can be open and vulnerable with. I know my ‚Äúbad trip‚Äù (I don‚Äôt believe in such things but for the sake of simplicity, I‚Äôll call it that) would have been far more manageable if I had a hand to hold. Just one other person would have made a world of difference. But I still don‚Äôt regret it.

Something I found helped is making comments to other people about how hot and sweaty you are. A lot of times I was sweating because I was uncomfortable and would then sweat more because of that.

Then he finds out the Marines don't have their own medics. They use Navy medics. He was sent off to the front lines, never even set foot on a Navy ship. "

The doctor shouted at me 'you're supposed to tell me when it starts hurting, if I do this too long I could severely injure your foot' to which I reply 'maybe you should have told me that before you started.

5117,"I have never understood the obsession with getting anal from girls. I guess I'm just boring, but the good old fashioned 'giney hole feels way better to me, it self lubricates, and communicates much more efficiently with the 'D. Furthermore, any talk about how the back door has a tighter seal is even less convincing.

It gets called out because darker skinned folk have very rarely had makeup that fits them, or we have had to make do with shit makeup for ages. For decades there has been makeup catering to light skin VERY WELL to the point of almost purposeful exclusion of darker skin tones, while complaints have gone unheard. Now there are brands that cater very well to our skin tones (AND very fair tones as well), so it's frustrating when people clog up those platforms pretending to complain about a problem when really it's just a way to brag about how light their skin is.

The band challenge him to do a backflip in exchange for a free round of drinks for the wedding guests. I believe the band thought the groom wouldn't chance it and get a good laugh out of the guests. 

Band counts down... Groom backflips lands on his head in such a way his head was at a 90 degree angle from his body. Lying cold on the floor, people scramble to help him fortunately there were a few nurses attending. Ambulance arrives and takes groom and bride to the hospital which was two hours away. The band leaves soon after without saying a word. Guests left in shock so we either kept drinking or went home. 

Few hours later couple land back, the groom is in good form but warned he's suffering from a concussion. Continues to drink and dance like a mad man the rest of the night. The bride wasn't too impressed with the 5 hours they missed of their own wedding but hey it's a great memory and the groom didnt die."

20+ years later they both still live there with their parents. Neither work or go out unless it's with a parent. I see them in the supermarket following the mum not talking and looking sad.

The problem remains. Calls me in despair and I say no to worry, I'll take care of it. Box is too big for me to carry, so I ask a friend, James, to help me out. We get it to the post office and send it.

A week later I go and visit. We're happy to be back together and go to a fancy restaurant. Midway through the meal I remember ""did you pick up your parcel already?"" ""No, I will afterwards"" ""It's 9pm, I'm pretty sure the post office is closed by now..."" We checked online and it was. Huuuuuge tantrum. In the middle of the goddamn restaurant. Audible to everyone. On the verge of tears. I just kept eating silently.

Next day after we get the box, I am told I really should thank James. I can't fucking believe it. ""He's the one who solved it. You helped, but I'm a bit disappointed - you weren't really the one to solve my problem"". I lost it.

5253,"while I appreciate unions as a concept the one that I was part of was an absolute piece of crap. I called in with a question for the union and the next day I had a store manager coming up to me asking what my issue was... Like have they never heard of confidentiality and perhaps why I was calling the union instead of asking a manager?

In addition, my rate of pay was barely above minimum wage, my benefits were slim to none (i worked full time there for over a year but was still classed as part time because there were no full time positions open) and fully 3/4s of my union hand book (which was almost an inch thick) dealt only with employees hired before 1985... aka the union had been handing back benefits etc to the company and in general screwing over their new employees.

Unions are run by people and people can be both great and awful and the state of your union will depend on the people who are running it. I have heard wonderful stories of unions like this one where the employee is definitely better off, and there are stories where the union is completely failing their members because the union heads are in the pockets of company management."

5256,"A long time ago I met this girl; super cute, funny, smart and fun. Unfortunately at the time she was 13 and I was 16, which is obviously a creepily large gap at that age. I knew I had a huge crush on her but I knew she was too young for me so I never pursued her, I was perfectly happy being friends. Over time we kinda grew apart.

A decade passes. I go through a life ruining all-hope-is-lost breakup. After months of the darkest depression I decide to put myself out there again, reconnect with old friends, etc. Then I remember her. I thought ""hey, she probably won't message me back, and we're probably way different people now, but fuck it, she was a cool friend."" She messaged me back, we hit it off again, turns out we live sorta near each other and we make a plan to meet up. I didn't have a car so my friend who was sick of seeing me so depressed agreed to drive me and hang out til I need s drive back. Nbd, not like anything's gonna happen, it'll just be 3 people hanging out. 

We meet up, and she's a hundred times cooler and hotter than I remembered. I'm head-over-heels in about 20 seconds. We have a great time, all of us, and I'm basically making plans to tell her how I feel and always felt after a few more hangouts. I tell my friend all this, he's happy for me. 

A week later we're chatting online and she mentions offhandedly that my friend asked her out, as if must have already known. I ask my friend about this, he basically shrugged it off, like ""yeah I didn't warn you, why would I have?"" I'm so hurt and enraged by his betrayal that I can't see straight, but as much as I hated it, I decided to be the bigger person and not sabotage it. That said I cannot bear to have my feelings go unspoken, so I told her how deeply I felt. Her answer is a long story but it ends with her saying she just wants to date around right now and doesn't want to be tied down, but she's already said yes to a date with him. 

They hang out. Afterwards he tells me he's not that into her but ""at least the sex was great"". 

They stop talking, her and I remain friends with the understanding that I like her and I'm waiting to see if she likes me back. After a while she stops messaging back. Perhaps I wasn't the one for her, but I'll never know how things would be different if I had told her the truth flat out instead of waiting until I felt it was right. 

The moral is don't wait a day. Don't wait a n hour. Don't wait a second. Tell the people you care about how you feel and chance the consequences. The kind of regret that comes from failing is like honey compared to the regret of trying to play it safe.

Sorry for the novel, needed to get that out.

Edit: so a couple people have commented about my friend being a complete ass so I guess I'll tell you guys about another important lesson I learned from this experience.

My friend has always had  anxiety and difficulty socializing; he hasn't had many long term friends aside from me. At the end of the story we had been friends for about 14 years, since elementary school. I was actually living with him at the time because when I went through the breakup I lost my home and had nowhere else to go. He took me in, put up with all my bs and gave me some much needed perspective. And then he betrayed me. Obviously my first instinct was to burn the friendship and try to find somewhere else to live, but before that I decided to try the unthinkable: have a frank conversation about our feelings and try to reconcile. He told me that he only asked her because he was sure she would say no; because why would anyone say yes to him? He doesn't exactly have a great self image, and he's used to having no opportunities to ask people out. He was motivated by desperation, loneliness and a certainty that he wasn't worthy anyway. I could understand that, and I'd like to think I'm a big enough person to realize that this setback wasn't the end of the world for me; in fact even after this I still had a better and easier chance of finding happiness and companionship than he did. I couldn't hold that against him.

I tried at least to get him to apologize for not telling me in advance, even if he didn't ask my permission. He brought up how I hadn't exactly been an ideal friend to him in the past. I didn't know what he was talking about, but after getting him to clarify I saw that he was right. There had been times that I wasn't there for him when a good friend should have been, and I felt like a total ass for not having realized this on my own. It didn't excuse what he did, but it sure gave me some perspective. If he hadn't chosen to forgive me without even asking for an apology, I would have missed out on a valuable relationship with someone who knows and understands me better than anyone who was still in my life. 

By the end of it I had forgiven him and I was the one apologizing, realizing that what I had done hurt him more than this debacle had hurt me. It was still a dick move on his part to put his interests above mine, but I realized that I didn't need selfless loyalty from him. Burning our friendship didn't help any of us, but forgiving him, though it was brutally hard, was the better choice. I now know I can't rely on him when his interests and mine conflict, but he took me in when I had no other good options and is still a positive aspect of my life. We can chill and be bros without having the kind of relationship I thought we had. Honestly i don't feel that bad about the lost chance with the girl anymore but if I had told him to fuck off forever, regardless of whether he deserved it, I'd miss his company now. 

To summarize: bros &gt; hoes"

He pretty much enters a room where a girl is held captive and takes out the guys who are holding her by smacking them. The girl then asks who he is to which he replies completely deadpan, ""Im the cook"". Gonna add the link real quick

5367,"My bestie and I were hanging out in my condo one morning. I was in the kitchen likely cooking and she was in my dining room working remotely in her laptop. All of a sudden we hear a few chords from a music box. We stop dead. I look at her and she looks at me and says ‚ÄúYou heard that, right?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYeah! That‚Äôs the snow globe my sister gave me.‚Äù 

Background info on the snow globe:
In honor of being the godmother of her firstborn, my sister gave me a pink snow globe that had a little girl kneeling on a pillow praying. The globe had a mechanical aspect to it where it could be wound up to spin and play music like a music box. When I first received it I wound it and set it so that the little girl would always face forward towards the inscription she had engraved on the front. 

I quickly walk into my bedroom where the snow globe sat on my dresser. The little girl had been turned all the way around exactly 180 degrees from where I left her. No one else was in my condo. No one else was in my bedroom. And judging by the layers of dust on that globe no one had touched it in years. Yet, she started up all on her own one random morning. 

My bestie then told me to immediately call my sister to have her check on her daughter/my goddaughter. I did so and she said everything was fine. ‚ÄòTil this day we still can‚Äôt figure out why it turned on by itself to face backwards. Til this day it has never happened again. üò≥"

So I punched the window near the chip and made it spider and they replaced the windshield for free after that. Just a fair warning if the resin isn‚Äôt good quality it‚Äôs going to look like shit.

It sounds like you might have low self-esteem. No judgement; I dealt with it for a long time and that's just what jumped out at me.

If you don't reach out to talk to your friends because you're afraid of being bothersome, then you're not valuing your contribution to the friendship and people who act as if they are without value are often perceived as being without value.

You're valuable. Being that careful about other people's time means that you care a great deal about the people around you. That's a gift, one you give away every day.

If your friends don't appreciate your value, find others who will. If they do appreciate your value, then the best way to respect their appreciation is for you to appreciate it as well."

5430,"I've thought about this before and I think this could be an awesome idea for a movie or a show. Even though most people don't care about this, I think there is enough for something compelling about the story of horse racing in Tijuana during the 1920-30s at the Tijuana Race Track and later on Agua Caliente. 

Most people don't know how much of an impact those two tracks had on the history of the sport and there are so many great stories to tell. For example, On February 5, 1927 the film *Sunset Derby* was being shot at the Tijuana racetrack. A track official noticed the way a director was using a microphone and a loudspeaker to direct his crew and actors during the filming. The idea came to him that if he had a microphone set up in the Stewards booth that led to a set of speakers, he could call the positions of the horses like a director gave direction. 

Later that day, he had it set up without telling any of the patrons to the track about it. When people first experienced it, they were extremely confused. Before that people would keep track of the horses themselves with binoculars and often were unable to get a great view at certain angles. After they got used to it, they loved hearing a race being called and it became an everyday thing at that small track. Now, it's an extremely important part of modern day racing all across the world. Along with this these two tracks are responsible for the starting gate, the scratch rule, the first photo finish, modern day safety helmets for jockeys and more.

These historical anecdotes about racing could just play a small part into the story. The bigger story is how lush it was there back then. Because during the time drinking and gambling was illegal in US, so Hollywood celebrities like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton would go down to Tijuana to spend time at the races and the casino. Al Capone was also a regular and Rita Hayworth started out as a dancer at the Casino there. The tracks were also responsible for some really exciting racing, like the $100,000 Agua Caliente Handicap, which the famous Australian horse Phar Lap won, along with Seabiscuit years later.

The Tijuana track also flooded twice so there's some drama there and it would go all the way up until 1935 when the newly elected President Lazaro Cardenas started a reform program that included an end to legalize gambling. Agua Caliente did open up again later, but I think this time period is the most exciting.

I imagine this being a show more that a movie, a bit like Boardwalk Empire, however with the right script I think it can work as a movie too showing this really awesome period of history in Mexico and horseracing that most people are not even aware of."

5451,"I didn't know the term then, but I could easily have been one.

I'm bisexual and was deep in the closet. I didn't know any lesbians and didn't know how to meet any. I didn't want an online dating profile because I didn't want anyone finding and outing me. So dating was hard.

I'd find someone at a lesbian bar, ask them out, get shot down SO MUCH. When I did get a date, they would reject me and not tell me why. They were happy for me to pay for dates, and it never ever got to sex. And all I wanted to do was to figure myself out and fuck a girl to see if I liked it. Their personality didn't make a difference to me. I honestly just wanted to get laid. Also, I'm a programmer and really good at my work... But these girls didn't care or want to know. It felt like they were judging me by some invisible criteria I had no control over. I got ghosted so much.

I had so many mental health issues from not being able to figure out what was going on with my sexuality, and it honestly felt like fucking a woman would be the holy Grail that told me everything, but it wasn't happening. It added a layer of desperation to everything. 

Finally I dated an older woman who didn't BS and holy hell it was glorious. It felt like this huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I guess my problem was I was dating younger women who had awful social skills and zero empathy and were going through their own issues. 

But this whole experience made me more sensitive to what men go through when dating and when I could, I'd always be kind if it didn't work out. I never ghosted. I always made sure to set realistic expectations. Just being clear and firm about my expectations made it easier for my dates to live up to them. I dated like 50 men after that and had only one person show some crazy. "

5487,"Not quite so crazy...

I kept seeing a job in my field on linkedin in an NZ town/area I am open to moving to - USA company name (No biggie as it's a large multi-national) the NZ town has a population of only 500.

The job used a lot of terms I'd expect to see in USA jobs (Mandatory overtime, imperial units for physical requirements, low annual leave, etc). Still not a huge red flag - apart from being really ""odd"" that they wouldn't have adapted the wording.

I ended up taking a quick trip around the small town via google street view looking for this large food processing plant.

Turns out that there is a city in Kansas,USA with the same name - and has a factory owned by the multi-national.
Linkedin was showing this job as 8000 miles away from it's real location.

I about had a nervous breakdown &amp; in the most pissed off, frustrated tone, looked at them both &amp; said ""Why can't you fucking TALK like fucking ADULTS instead of arguing like fucking CHILDREN?""

5565,"We acquired a 12 year old boy about a year and a half ago, our nephew.

By the terms of the will of his father (a single parent after mom - wife's sister - passed away from cancer several years earlier), we are ""testamentary guardians.""  Godparents, so to speak, so we knew that in theory we were next in line to be his adults. And dad had medical issues, so we knew it was more than merely possible that this could happen.

I guess that may have mentally prepared us for what has happened.

We did not adopt the lad because it would have complicated his and our estates, there is no financial benefit in it for him, and we don't want to legally erase his real mom and dad.  But for all practical purposes, this is our kid going forward.

Initially, what was it like? A whirlwind. In retrospect, having our bio-babies was a whirlwind too, meaning complex emotions and little sleep.

The lad was pretty shocked and sad to be an orphan, of course.

He actually called us first thing in the morning in hysterics, saying ""daddy is not moving, what do I do"" - I was out the door 30 seconds later while my wife set up a 3-way call with 911. I guess the lad was being walked through attempts to resuscitate my brother-in-law while the ambulance and I were hurrying over to the apartment.  They beat me by a minute or so. I got there while the medics were flipping over the shockingly blue body, the kid standing over with his hands on his face.

I grabbed the kid, hustled him out of sight (but not hearing alas), praised his bravery and valor. He asked me if dad is dead. I said I didn't know.

The medics called it pretty much at that moment.

Cleaning out their apartment was a lot of work but we did it quickly, with friends and family pitching in. I took pictures and videos so he would have a record of how it looked. At some point he might find that cool, rather than triggering, I figured.

Moving him into our place was fairly straightforward. He knew us well already, being close emotionally and geographically, and having gone on joint vacations. In that respect it was an easy initial transition. He already had clothes and things in our place.

Emotionally, too, it has been perplexingly easy for him, or at least I hear very few complaints.

I guess to him we were seen as ""the stable family"" with a house and lots of games and toys and pets, the ones that did fun things but also ate healthy food and went on walks, the ones who arrived on time, who followed through on promises.

He also loves and looks up to our bio-kids, who are several years older.

After a diplomatic month or two, they have been treating him as they treat each other and us, which is to say, they troll him relentlessly but expect him to give back, stand up for himself, and join in games and fun.

And now? The lad seems...well, he seems great.

I wonder at times if he is holding back his grief and loss, and if he feels that he must be on his best behavior. Maybe that will come out more with teen years and the passage of time.

But we have an excellent uncle-nephew relationship with regularly scheduled trips to the gym where it is just us guys talking, and I believe him when he says that while he would love for his dad to be alive again, he much prefers living with us.

The feelings aren't mutual, unfortunately. It is a grind, at times, for my wife and kids.

Part of it, I think, is the condition in which he came to us - frankly, pretty pathetic. Not a good student, or naturally witty...obese, super awkward, knock knees, treats every situation like he will certainly fail, a crier, no friends, his main attachment was grandma, who cut up his food. He literally did not know how to tie his shoelaces, or use a knife and fork. At 12!

However he has applied himself diligently to learning basic social skills, and we kinda leaned on him to make friends at school, and of course he is off his all-fast food lifestyle. He has taken up piano lessons, fencing, running -- that plus puberty has drastically changed him from a retiring orb with pretzel legs into a thin tall handsome dude who is starting to wear me down on our runs. On weekends he usually hangs with some kids his own age.

I've impressed on him the idea that you can't flip a switch and be confident. Being told ""get confident"" won't work - real confidence comes from actually being GOOD AT THINGS and he is working at it. Definitely getting there, although still being trolled relentlessly. He gives it back now!

But the main grind is not to him but us - that us, my wife and I, as a couple. It is hard for her most of all because, well, even in our egalitarian society, more is expected of a mother, and/or she expects more of herself.

We were thinking we were getting to the end of teen parenting but it is now back, with school meetings, homework help, etc, with the new factor that because he is still a nephew rather than son or daughter, WE feel that we have to be on a slightly unnatural plane, rather than just being ourselves.

So on long vacations, he goes to visit grandma or to camp, and it feels like a breath of normalcy - she feels free, smiles more -- which then makes her feel guilty, like she is shitty and lacking compassion. And she is stung by resentments. We got a lot of facile praise for bringing in our nephew, and zero offers to step in for us. It was clearly assumed that we would be the ones.

Why did they assume it? Because we are the obvious choice...which leads to both pride, and feeling like you're being rewarded for having made good life choices by being given extra work.

Not sure what to do about that. It's just life, I guess.

And, in the big picture, a good life. Personally I am very proud of us as a family, that we have been handed a challenge and so far, so good.

The ultra-rich can join terrorist organizations and then get off the hook because they said sorry and paid a few people off.

throw away account cause this is really personal.

My last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs I was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.

I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.

I had a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.

One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade). I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.

I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real!

The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspective and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, all kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.

at some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.

I was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..

I went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision, he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says.

EDIT (24 hours after post): never though anyone would read this, I changed a line so that it no longer seems that my 2 year old daughter bore a child.

I have never seen Inception or the Star Trek episode so many have mentioned (but I will eventually)

5584,"As you mention it, the Atomic Bombs (and subsequent arms race) are something I feel should be brought up more often with regards to their perceived weakness.

Every aspect of what they accomplished should utterly confound and terrify the wizarding community. They dropped an object onto a city and wiped out the city along with thousands in it, in an instant. Twice. And with lasting damage.

I don't think anything has been described as having that much destructive force in the magical community. And the humans managed to create it. Voldermort's arguments should have been less ""Look at how weak they are."" and more ""Look at how terrifying they can be.""

But even at that, firearms should be terrifying in their eyes. Tools that can kill faster than you can speak.

5624,"Sadly, it wasn't too long ago that this happened... I was working the afternoon shift when an older woman - who didn't look particularly clean, and who I hadn't liked when she was checking in - told me that it smelled like somebody had pooped themselves on the elevator. I thanked her for letting me know, then I went to essentially dump a gallon of Febreeze in the elevator. It definitely smelled strong, and it took a little creativity to air the elevator out as much as possible. 

I chalked it up to the lady having a case of the walking farts and made my way back to the front desk, putting my Febreeze up. But that smell... It kept following me, through the hallway and down toward the lobby. I sprayed more and more Febreeze, but it didn't go away. It.... lingered.

Eventually, we were somehow alerted that the women's bathroom in the lobby had a backed up toilet - so I grabbed my plunger and some gloves and ducked my head in to see what was going on.

I did not want to see what was going on.

There was a small boy, between seven and nine, completely buck naked, ducking between the stalls, while the woman who had come to the front desk had obviously not expected such a quick response time. She told him to pick the smaller stall and stay in it while I did my work. 

The issue turned out to be that the child had shat himself and not told anybody, made his way to the lobby bathroom, and then... proceeded it smear it on every. Fucking. Surface. in the damn bathroom. The trashcan, counter, both stall doors, both toilets, and there were even shitty little shit nuggets in the bins we provide for period waste. Oddly enough, the toilet wasn't clogged at all - I can't even remember if there was shit in the toilet.

I went right back out and told my manager to do it. I don't get paid enough."

Being vocal about wants and needs from both sides of a sexual relationship makes it much more satisfying.

Make sure to acknowledge her criticism and either vocalize or show her how you act to correct her criticism.

5646,"There was a lot of great hard rock and heavy metal in the 1990s that got washed away with the popularity of grunge and alternative (not dissing those genres I like them too). A lot of band really came into their own that decade and don't have a lot to show for it, and a lot of established bands made excellent albums that are glossed over in their history.

5658,"Here‚Äôs how it works, from the perspective of someone living in England:

‚Ä¢ Almost all of it is taxpayer funded. Prescription medication is subsidized instead of entirely funded (so you pay a flat fee - currently equivalent to around $10 - for each prescription, regardless of the cost of the medication to the health service. If you need a lot of meds you can pay a monthly subscription for unlimited meds instead. Certain types of people are exempt). 

Dental is also subsidized, optical is free or subsidized for some categories of people. Everything else is free IIRC. 

‚Ä¢ These are both included free as well. 

‚Ä¢ This problem only exists in America, and only because the healthcare system is uniquely based entirely on private, for-profit, corporations. American healthcare is the most expensive in the world because of this. In the UK we don‚Äôt have that problem, because there are no shareholders that are expecting a return on their investment, the whole thing is just owned and administered by the government. 

‚Ä¢ Individuals pay tax, and employers pay tax. Some of this goes to the National Health Service. Employers can provide private healthcare as an additional benefit or whatnot, but they don‚Äôt have to pay specifically into any health thing, just usual taxes, some of which is used on healthcare. 

Finally before anyone asks; yes our tax rates are higher than in the US to pay for this, however, remember, we don‚Äôt pay health insurance. On average we end up with a higher percentage of what we earn left after paying tax, than an average American paying tax and health insurance. "

One guy came in for a room absolutely shitfaced at 10AM. I always rejected people like him but my colleague from the morning shift always felt bad for types like that so she gave him a room.


I had the afternoon shift (starting at 3PM)

He came down from his room and sat down at the bar. Kept wanting a whisky but I refused to give him alcohol; cause fuck that. Ended up making a scene and throwing a fit like a little kid. Still refused.

He went out to a shop and came back with several bottles of whisky. Fuck.

Anyway, he went straight up to his room with them so didn't have a lot of problems.

At around 7PM he comes down and, what I thought was impossible, came down even more drunk.

He ordered a pizza so while I was putting it in the oven he kept, once again, begging for alcohol. Still refused to give him anything.

20 minutes later, pizza is done and he goes up with it. Suddenly I could smell piss and shit, absolutely disgusting. I trace the smell and it was piss from one of our bar chairs dripping all the way to the entrance of the elevator; he pissed/shit himself while waiting on the fucking pizza.


A few minutes later one of our regulars comes in and calls down the elevator. The elevator opens and what do we see? The dude is laying down in the elevator covered in pizza slices on his face/chest, piss and shit. Man passed out standing up (I have to say this was fucking hilarious).

I wake him up and send him up again. You guessed it, elevator comes down again, opens up and now he is pissing in the corner of the elevator.


I decide to go up with him instead and let him into his room.


That was that for my shift. However the next day the housekeeping comes down in the morning. When they opened his room to clean he was long gone but the curtains were dragged down from the ceiling, wrapped up in a ball and they were covered in shit and piss.

To top it off he apparently called an escort in the middle of the night and our housekeeping found a used condom wrapped around our fire sprinkler thing (don't know the English word, apologies).


Yeah, he was quite something.


I could at least 10 more stories I could write, crazy shit happens in hotels, man."

5678,"I think the reason redditors get defensive when the idea of white privlidge gets braught up is because it reduces people down to the color of their skin and deminishes their accomplishments. When you say that white people have some fundamental societal advantage in life just because they were born white, it sends the message that all the struggles they wen't through weren't really that difficult. It also discounts the hardships of white immigrants, such as the Irish, during the early to mid 1900's.

Also, the idea that if you defend something you somehow believe it to be true is pretty ridiculous. When I get defensive toward flat-earthers or people who are against vaccines, its not because I think they're right. I think their ideas are so fundamentally broken that they need to have the flaws in their thinking explained so they don't keep pushing their absurd beliefs onto people. "

15 years in, and I find texts on her phone. Completely blindsided... No clue she had it in her to cheat. Told me it was just texting. Begged for forgiveness. I caved. A month later, checked the phone bill to find that it never stopped. Confronted her again... Cue more begging and more denial on my part that she would let the life we had built go down in flames. This went on for a few months. So many promises. One night, I caught her on the phone when she thought I had left. Suddenly it's not just texts. Sometimes it was phone calls too... Just a friend she could talk to that she let things go too far with. Promised to break all contact. Swore it was never physical. Then I found emails. She detailed things that made me sick to read... But also included descriptions of his house. She broke finally, but swore it was all just in the line of duty. That's how she met, you see? Visiting nurse service, and this guy was a client. Promised she was done. Loved me, you see? No chance she was going to let 15 years go like that. I wasn't buying it anymore though. She announced she was going out one night with a work friend. Promised they were only going to the bar, then she'd be home. Maybe late, but not too late. She had taken over her own phone account by then, but wasn't bright enough to understand that Google Latitude was still showing me where she was, and I wasn't about to show my hand. She kissed me goodbye and bee-lined right for his house, and was there until the wee hours of the morning. Once I knew where she had headed, I called her dad and my best friend to keep me from doing anything dumb. I will love them both forever for keeping me calm while my world went fucking insane all around me. My father in law offered to stay with the kids and wait for her to get home. Around 3am, while couch surfing my buddy's place, she sent me a nasty text asking where the fuck I thought I was. I texted her a screenshot of her little GPS dot at her boyfriend's and let her know I'd be sending her some paperwork soon. "

5698,"I'm not a dentist, so I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think mouthwash gets everything out. I actually have a permanent retainer on the bottom of my teeth, and when I go to the dentist, they give me these [loop things](https://www.gumbrand.com/gum-eez-thru-floss-threaders-840a.html) that you put floss in that actually goes inbetween the teeth and the retainer. There's also these [weird rubber brush things](https://www.gumbrand.com/gum-soft-picks-40-ct-632rc.html) that go inbetween the teeth and scrub out the gunk, which is actually less painful than floss! I just prefer regular floss because it's cheaper."

5703,"Double check the processes for recycling. I only recently learned that in the province where I live recycling places don‚Äôt accept recyclables that are in a blue recycling bag. They have to be loose. If they come across a bag full of recyclables, they chuck the whole thing in the trash.

5704,In Spain.
5705,"Yes. So the Nazis were horrible human beings and committed horrible atrocities in the name of their ideology. However, they were still German, and the Germans (at that time and before) at their core believed in discipline, structure, following orders to the letter, obedience, and in a weird way they loved the efficiency in well timed formal bureaucracy and red tape. It wasn't that killing civilians (Jews, Poles, Russians etc...) was the problem for many among the SS that hated Dirlewanger, but the fact that he did it with such brutality, inefficiency, without going through the proper chain of command and without doing it in a structured / sterilized manor that pissed off the rest of the SS. Especially by the mid late part of the war when the Concentration Camps and Death Camps were in full swing, the Nazis kept records and tried to be efficient and mechanical as possible (almost like running factories for killing people) with their extermination of innocent people. Dirlewanger did what he wanted with as much brutality and barbarity as he pleased, regardless of what his superiors or other units thought, so this made him dangerous and ironically at odds with many Nazis. Go figure! "
5706,"I remember when I was 17. I was the dutiful child. I left high school and went to the college my parents liked and studied what my parents said would be useful.(UK so high school ends at 16 college 16-18 then uni 18-21) To someone more academically minded I wholeheartedly agree with the course choice. At the end of the year the first year results come out. I'd bombed. Hard. So I was faced with a choice find a new college or bore myself to tears studying the same crap that I clearly didn't like or want to learn.

I chose the former. Made a few phone calls and grabbed an audition for a music college. Went home grabbed my guitar and shot off for this audition. I got accepted and instantly called my mother excited about this new development in my life. I remember the phone call to this day. However I'll summarise 'Music won't get you anywhere it's a waste of time and I won't support this decision. You do this, you do this on your own!'

I said fine. This is what I want to do so I'll be attending this college from September and when I get something meaningful from it I'll happily rub your nose in it

Fast forward 2 years of college later I'm loving it genuinely happy met some awesome people some I'm still in touch with now. And I get accepted into my first choice university and have a scholarship to an overseas university. I go to the local University that I wanted to attend.

A slight mishap in second year meant I had to resit a couple of modules the following year.  2 years later. I get my grades. And I have my degree. First thing I did when I got my results was take them to my mother. Who was at work. Present them to her. And said I told you I'd get something worthwhile.

6 months later I started teacher training. Which unfortunately wasn't for me. But I qualified. That was another victory. 

Granted now I'm not in the music industry and while I would love to go and do a masters degree and potentially become a university lecturer in my chosen field. My current work life won't allow me to do that even part time. I will one day do that. And I will do it before my mother inevitably passes on. And I will invite her to my first lecture. And I will do the final nose rub. Just to. Show her that I made it. And my 17 year old self never forgot the lack of confidence she showed me. 
"
5707,"Yup, my brother is 12 years younger than me.  I was the built in babysitter.  I did everything for him.  I even tried to take him with me when I turned 18.  My parents wouldn't let me. "

I walked in one day sat down like usual for a Saturday morning breakfast, and one of them walks up and takes my order.  I remember thinking at the time, no way, really.  Didn't say a word, just went about my normal routine.  As I was finishing up my breakfast, my GM comes over to sit down and we do a little informal meeting (mostly just to cover anything urgent she has).  Waitress walks up as we are finishing our meeting to offer me a warm up, and my GM introduces me (GM has no clue we know each other).

I've always been back and forth with depression. 

I started trying different meds, seeing a therapist. Etc. She didnt understand, so she shut down, kinda pretended i was ok, when i wasn't. 

This led me to externalizing my own feelings and anxieties on the relationship and on her. I guess it was easier to make her ""the bad guy"".

Then I met a coworker who was in my same boat and understood me, she was good to talk to, which furthered the stress on my marriage. So I left.

18 months later I have my shit together and I realize that it was all my fault and not hers, I wish I had stuck it out a little longer."

If the doctor didn‚Äôt press charges or give any other reason for firing with cause she would win.

Co teacher and I opened the door, made eye contact with the cryer.... then slowly backed out of the room believing no one saw us..

I am finally starting to get butterflies for women again first time in 8 years happened last week. My heart has been closed for business. I have tried but nothing.
5744,"Seriously, this!

As a teenager I had to go to school.  Not only did my parents make me, but the law itself made me.  I couldn't wait until I turned 17 so I could drop out and just take the GED and get it over with.  People could abuse me from my parents, to my peers, to teachers, to cops, and pretty much any other adult and there was nothing I could do about it.  I was suicidal because of that shit.  I can be forced to participate in activities because it'll make me well rounded or some crap when I hated doing them, but there was no choice.

As an adult, I have to work, but if people in the workplace bother me, I can report them to HR, or to the police, or I can just drop the bomb and quit.  It's liberating knowing I can just simply leave.  There are no forced activities for me.  If I feel like staying home all weekend playing video games while not wearing pants, then it's pantsless video game weekend time for me.  If I decide I'd like to go out, I can, but if I'm not enjoying myself, then I can leave freely.

Being an adult is so much better!"

5770,"This wasn't scary per say, but my great grandmother gave my mother a music box that somewhere along the way had broken and sat idly in our living room and it never worked.

However, the night my great grandmother died, the music box strangely began playing again, but without any of us twisting the knob.

We have a lot more freedom and independence, plus disposable income. And, I don't pee myself every time I sneeze, so that's a bonus.

After the emotional part has been quelled a bit you can test the waters to see if the individual is willing to further evaluate the situation that initially upset her and explore what possible roles she played to get the situation to where it is. You can certainly be supportive and then offer some advice or guidance to help them see their mistakes without being accusatory.

Now half of the visitors are people who just want to get wasted / high and never would go even close to listening to techno in their free time. Half of the DJs play the same 20 songs at every gig for the whole season, and half of the organisers just want to make as much money as possible.

On the other hand, this makes the underground-parties just so much more enjoyable, although they are so much more rare now."

5845,"the grocery shrink ray.  

I HATE this shit so much. It happens everywhere. From gorcery stores to fast food/restaurants. 

Basically they change the amount/size of the food but still charge the same price. Often they change the packaging to make the product look the same size or even bigger. They do this instead of raising the price. 

It has become an industry standard practice instead of being completely upfront about the change. Basically they are trying to trick the consumer into thinking they are still getting the same amount of product they are used to. They claim they are being truthful because they list the quantity on the product (in a tiny spot).

This practice is very anti-consumer. And laws need to be enacted so that anytime a product's amount changes and the price doesnt it needs to be advertised on at least 25% of the package front (for 6 months) to make sure the change is very obvious to consumers.

I personally find myself more inclined to believe one of the other two theories I've heard, namely either Eurasia and Eastasia exist as described in Goldstein's book (that is, basically the same as Oceania), or Big Brother controls the entire world. After all, Orwell basically wrote 1984 as a worst-case-scenario situation, so it is fair to believe that Big Brother is all-powerful and will last forever, and no one in the entire world will ever have any hope of living without oppression. And he wrote it as a criticism of Stalin's regime, so it might be fair to believe that Eurasia exists as an extension of the Soviet Union."

Nowadays it's more like heavy exaggerating than outright stories and when we catch it we just sort of become neutral about it and she calms down. A little care and understanding goes a long way.

So many days, I feel like I did nothing. Entirely useless. I didn't do the laundry, I didn't wash the dishes, I didn't clean up the living room. What kind of person doesn't do the most basic of household tasks?  
  
The principle of nonzero days brought some perspective to my situation. I don't have to clean the entire apartment to prove my worth or to make progress. I can take a deep breath and spend about 10 minutes walking around gathering dishes. My day is now a nonzero day, because that 10 minutes brought me closer to one of my goals (cleaning the apartment).

The problem was that she suggested 3 minute short breaks with 15 minute longer breaks. She also said that once I got past the initial starting point and got into the ""groove"" of an assignment, I should consider simply pushing through the breaks, as opposed to respecting them and keeping them consistent. In other words, she basically minimized the breaks in the interest of perceived efficiency, which completely goes against the spirit and science behind the technique. Unsurprisingly, I tried her version of the technique multiple times and found it to be too rigid and, overall, unsustainable.

6012,"Flatworms are hermaphroditic, so they have both the male and female parts at all times. They have a penis and produce sperm, but they also have ovaries and produce unfertilized eggs. They will fight each other and one or both will end up stabbing the other. At this point, they will transfer sperm either through the stab wound or through pores in their skin. The sperm will travel through the body to the ovaries, where it will fertilize the eggs and the ""losing"" flatworm will lay the eggs. Producing eggs is very taxing, so generally flatworms do not want to do that if they don't have to.

2.  Make a to-do list of things that bother you, occupy your mind, or you would like to do for yourself.  In the morning pick out something to work on.  As you work through the list you'll get relief from that stress.  As soon as something comes to mind, add it to the list.

If you stress over monthly bills, make a list for each month, print it out, and then you can cross stuff off as you take care of them.

In short, take things off your mind, put them on the list, work on the list as you have time.   And if you need to, spend a few hours a week organizing and cleaning out stuff."

After she was done she went to leave to give me a chance to redress. But after the last part of the exam she gives me a couple of taps with her palm on my stomach, give my stomach a double circle rub, gives an adorable short laugh, and tells me that I can put my clothes back on now before walking out of the room to give me some privacy.

6101,"It makes reproduction more difficult for the *rapist* ducks, which is a nice little punishment, tbh. If the female chooses a male and allows him access, he has a better chance of fertilizing her eggs. Many species have a similar war going on between female reproductive selection and male reproductive selection.

Another example is that a male chimp will sometimes make one female go off with him for weeks so he is 100% sure her baby is his... which means that if he loses his status or isn't high-status to begin with, another male may murder her baby to make her become fertile sooner. Female chimps prefer to mate with every single male so that none of the males are 100% sure the baby isn't theirs and no one will murder it.

Sunlight contains the full spectrum of UVA and UVB light (as well as UVC which doesn‚Äôt typically make it down to the surface). UVA and UVB comprise 280-400nm wavelength of light. We‚Äôve found that NB-UVB does a fairly decent job of damaging DNA of inflammatory cells, leading to improvement in inflammatory skin disease like psoriasis, without necessarily increasing your risk for skin cancer (there is still a theoretical risk but all large studies have not shown an association to date). Sunlight will definitely give you anti-inflammatory UV light, however the dose is unpredictable and the other wavelengths are certainly contributing to skin cancer risk and photoaging. I‚Äôd probably stick to medically proven safe and effective therapy myself. Also if you lose weight and quit smoking (not true for everyone, though) psoriasis tends to improve. Hope that helps!"

6347,"Let me start by saying I fucking *hate* the people I used to consider my friends. They've been out of my life for a few years now, and I couldn't be happier. They treated me like shit, and for almost 3 decades I put up with it, because I firmly believed that you don't treat friends like crap, even if they do this shit to you. They made my life extremely difficult for years. I could have finally snapped and told them off, but it just was not in my nature:

The story: I was going to transfer to college, and my friends decided to tag along to my orientation and to the interview process I had set up for meeting a roommate/doing a walkthrough of my prospective off-campus place. I don't know why they wanted to come along, it's a mystery to this fucking day.

I'll try to keep it short. My prospective roommate was an 18 year old, just-out-of-high-school teenage girl who was like a tenth my size. I'm a big lumberjack looking maniac on a GOOD day, and I already knew this was going to be difficult.

My ""Friends"" then decided to make jokes the entire time this girl and her helicopter mother toured the place with me. They made jokes about me ""having no problem getting laid"" and the female ""friend"" in my group even went so fucking far as to make god damned RAPE jokes. About me.

The mother definitely took note of the shit coming out of their mouths, asking the housing manager about installing locks on bedroom doors and shit like that.

I really should have said something, because as far as I knew, my attendance at this college depended 100% on me getting this fucking room.

I got an email from the roommate a day later, saying her mom backed out of payment, and she would not be living there so I'd have to find another roommate.  I informed the housing manager, who said ""what are you talking about? She didn't back out.""

tl;dr my piece of shit ex friends made jokes about a high school girl getting raped by her prospective new roommate (me) and nearly cost me my ability to attend college.

I did luck out when the dormitories called me, saying an opening had just become available.  I moved in fucking immediately.

That's not even what I consider the worst thing those pieces of shit ever put me through, either.  I could write a fucking book."

6408,"[Miracle of the House Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_House_of_Brandenburg)

It's the Seven Years War. Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, is defeated decisively at the Battle of Kunersdorf by the combined forces of his enemies, losing more than half his army. His enemies, the Russians are advancing on Berlin from the East, the Austrians are closing in from the South. Frederick manages to gather 30,000 men for the defense of Berlin against a force of more than 90,000. The situation is completely dire and Frederick is making plans to either die in the defense of his capital or take poison. He wrote of his enemies, ""We'll fight them ‚Äì more in order to die beneath the walls of our own city than through any hope of beating them."" And then the enemies who were closing in for final victory... just stopped, turned around, and went home.

What happened at that moment that prevented the Russians and Austrians from reaching their goal?  They had also taken heavy losses at Kunersdorf and decided they had over-extended themselves in a rapid advance, began to worry about their supply lines and their ability to occupy Berlin and so they just withdrew to fight another day.

Then, later in the war. Prussia's position turns bleak again. Frederick is again surrounded and isolated. When suddenly the Russian Tsarina dies and is replaced by her nephew, who in a strange twist, is a complete Prussophile and admirer of Frederick's. He once wrote to Frederick that he would rather be a colonel in the Prussian army than to be the Tsar of Russia. Of course not wanting to be the one to destroy his idol, the new Tsar turns Russia's armies around and signs a peace treaty with Frederick.

The shape had been slowly moving over to us but suddenly moved a little faster so we jumped up and it ""ran"" back to the water moving in a really odd way. Not quite like a seal but similar enough for everyone who hears our story to write it off as a seal and over active imagination. But when it hit the water it seemed to have found a deep patch or something because it looked completely flat before it moved quickly back out of the water. This is the craziest part: by now it was closer to the ferry dock so we could make out its silhouette more clearly and it moved as if it was getting onto two legs before shaking for a second and letting out a horrific sound as it lunged under the dock sending birds flying. The last thing we saw was the shape darting towards us on the sand a good two times bigger than its originally percieved size. I'll never forget the scream it had- there was something chillingly human about it.

None of that ""in the interest of full disclosure"" crap - if an employer can find a reason to toss your resume, they will, so DON'T GIVE THEM ONE. I've sat in on interviews where people have said they are in talks with a few other places they'd like to work for more and their chances were shot immediately. 

Another bit - your parents might tell you that loyalty is more important that experience, but anymore this just isn't the case. My friends and I just convinced another friend in computer sciences to leave his job at the campus book store he's been at for 2 years (Against the wishes of his mom) to go to a position that gets him computer science experience.

6497,"I worked at a Sears located in the mall one summer. Basically, once the main mall shut down, we couldn't let people in from the mall or out into the mall because of the contract with the mall and because of our liability insurance. For this reason, about half an hour before close we would start making announcements every five minutes in Spanish and English about locking the doors. Without fail, at least once a week some entitled bunghole would ignore these announcements, park on our side of the mall, then go into the main mall and end up locked out of the Sears. Sometimes they would become angry and start shaking the cage , like the auto lock would disengage with their rage. Sometimes they would tell at us to get a manager, which we promptly would. And sometimes they would make an appeal to emotion (I walk with a cane, I have a child, etc).

But the one lady who took the cake came in five minutes before close. I was at the back end where she came in. She had a toddler in a stroller. As she very slowly strolled past me, I greeted her and warned her that if she entered the mall, she probably wouldn't be able to get back into our store. She snorted at me and kept walking. The gates came down promptly at ten. She strolled up to it around 10:10 when I was straightening the area near the gated door. She started shouting.

Customer- HEY. OPEN THIS! I'm a paying customer and I only just stepped into the mall!

Me- I can't, sorry ma'am. Liability issue.

Customer-WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER!

Me- I'll get him.

 I bring the manager down, he is not pleased, but he's courteous.

Manager- I can't let you in. Liability.

Customer- LIABILITIY IS LETTING ME WALK AROUND THE MALL TO MY CAR IN THE DARK WITH MY CHILD! I HAD NO IDEA I'D BE SEPARATED FROM IT!

Manager- Ma'am, there have been announcements for the last half hour, and I saw you ignore Gastennui when she tried to warn you. As for being scared, there's a security kiosk around the corner. Seeing as your their liability now, I think they'd be glad to escort you back to your car. Have a good evening! 

Manager begins walking away. 

Customer-WHO'S YOUR BOSS?!

Manager rattles off his bosses name and office number, gives his credentials and tells her to make sure she gets his name right, then rides the escalator up to his office.

Of course he needs a book to tell him how to act, because he's actually a bad person. And considering he is also completely self-absorbed, he believes everyone must share these moral short-comings. So of course he is going to believe people who don't believe in the book are bad people."

6692,"Your FIL is a pos too. Sorry.

It can and does happen, even with the closest of family members. 
You can never know for sure, unless you're willingly leaving your child with a known pedator. That's why this blew my mind. Who leaves a kid with a stranger? 

If the family knew him ans trusted him and it happened, its still so, so wrong but they knew him enough to wholeheartedly believe he wasn't a danger. In this case, he was a complete stranger practically begging to watch their kid he's never met. That's weird on its own. 

As parents, you can only do your best to protect your kids. Sometimes it still happens but in this case, OPs parents didn't do their best and their child suffered because of it.

And again, wtf is wrong with your FIL?  Grrrrr"

6697,"Had a male cousin, 9 months my senior, around the age of 12 told me he wanted to do an 'experiment'.  He told me he wanted to see if sperm burns.  I didn't even know what sperm was at the time.  He had my pants down and I felt his dick poking a couple of times into my butt cheek and someone came home.  Saved me they did.

I completely forgot about it for YEARS until one day I saw his bum ass out on the street and he asked me for a few dollars, he was 'down on his luck' after being in and out of jail for the last 20 years.

It wasn't until he walked away and it hit me like a ton of bricks.  I felt an overwhelming sense of rage, regret, hurt, and a lot of other things.  I've only seen him twice since then, once at his mother's 90th birthday party and again when my mother was on her deathbed.

My wife asked me both times if I was going to confront him and I told her no because if he said that he forgot or tried to pretend that it didn't happen I'd kill him on the spot with my bare hands.

Since remembering I think about it almost every day.  How he could have destroyed my life.  How could someone, a blood relative, do that?  He wasn't gay, he was cruel and depraved and the only reason that I can think of is that he wanted to (literally) fuck me over."

6714,"I'm just going to jump in here and suggest that:

Having to relive it in court might be horrific for a child  

Having to do anything in court might be horrific for a child, especially against a family member who you might have grown up thinking was someone you could trust  

Rape and molestation is often one person's word against another and hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt  

Knowing that people do often get away with rape and molestation, it might cross your mind that it would do more harm than good to yourself to relive it in public  

The parent might - rightly or wrongly - have the same view and want to protect their child from further harm  

If, tomorrow, you got raped by a guy, wouldn't you have a single doubt about walking into your local police station to let them know? Or a reservation about standing up and talking about how you felt in front of the attacker, his family, your family, 12 strangers, some reporters, a judge and some other people you don't know? 

For clarity, victims should not feel ashamed and the perpetrators should be severely punished, but surely you can understand why that isn't as straightforward as you make it sound in 6 lines on Reddit? 
"
6715,"I really agree with this. When I reread the books the entire series I always pictured Harris as dumbledore. But as the series progressed and dumbledore‚Äôs character got fleshed out more, and more he definitely becomes a darker, more serious character, even though he still has his typical goofy eccentric moments. I agree that Gambon did a great job of showing the sterner more bad ass side of dumbledore. But I do wish we could‚Äôve seen more of dumbledore‚Äôs calculated goofiness like in the books. However I will say I think that Gambon portrayed that relatively well in the prisoner of Azkaban.  And he was great for Order of the Phoenix dumbledore where he barely talks to Harry at all in that book."
6716,"Reminds me of this old copypasta:

There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference Bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per house hold, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming that there is at least one good child in each.

Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second.

This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second -- 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional Reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour.

The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized Lego set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional Reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the ""flying"" Reindeer could pull ten times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them -- Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch).

600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance -- this would heat up the Reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of Reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the Reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire Reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to forces of 17,500 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo.

Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now."

Mike was explaining the rules to a convention attendee and walking people through how it worked, and Matt was speaking through a Strong Bad puppet as player two. When the game was done, Matt insisted (in the Strong Bad voice through the puppet, of course) that we all end the game in the Teen Girl Squad way with a rousing, ""IT'S OVEEEER!"" Apparently they only demoed that one playthrough during the entire convention. It was definitely a highlight of the trip. "

6725,"Flying into Hortheastern Pennsylvania to visit my grandparents we crossed over the Allegheny mountains from either New Jersey or Southeastern PA (Philadephia maybe). It was a small turbo-prop plane maybe 36 passengers. There was a thunderstorm either directly over the airport or nearly so. We couldnt get to another airport and couldnt stay aloft long enough to wait it out. So we landed.

They had served drinks within the last 30 minutes (it was about an hour flight.) and because of the storm, we hit some terrible turbulence and dropped probably a couple hundred feet in seconds. The lady 2 seats ahead of me still had a full drink. I know because I watched that drink go airborne hit the ceiling of the aircraft and when we regained level flight had set down in the lap of the passenger directly behind me. When we finally got into the terminal, my brother and I were practically tackled by our grandparents and three of our great aunts. 

Worst flying experience I've ever had. Glad to have never had anything worse."

If the leak occurs then you know the source is from the pipes that lead to the faucet. If no leak then cover the drain and pour the water all around your shower. If the leak occurs then you know you need to reseal your shower with caulk. If no leak then remove the cover off the drain and let water run down the pipes. If the leak occurs then you know it‚Äôs from your drain pipes. Hope this helps someone :) "

It was about the fact that I wasn't just going to sit there and let them abuse me emotionally.

We waited a long time but that was because she was at an appointment. My dentist had asked the mom beforehand if it was okay if his daughter and some friends meet her daughter and her mom was all like, ‚ÄúYes yes of course!!‚Äù

Eventually Demi walks in kind of awkwardly and uncomfortably. Despite our age we were good about remaining calm. We got autographs on these cheesy Disney pictures we had printed out of her and took pictures. She was nice. My mom said it was clear she really didn‚Äôt want to be there but she was nice. After all, we were little kids and she was just starting to launch her career. 

I recently in a box of old stuff found the autograph (This happened in middle school. I‚Äôm now a college graduate) and of course my mom still has the most uncomfortable (on my part and sort of her part) picture I‚Äôve ever taken with a human being in my entire life.

That being said, as an adult, I also realize that adults aren't as dumb as kids think, so there was a small chance that she suspected it wasn't real, and didn't care.

This trope never plays out as ""oh shit, her boyfriend is physically abusive, I better make sure she gets out of there"". It's more often ""I should be with that girl, see, her boyfriend is abusive so I should be her boyfriend now"". It's never about realistically looking at the emotional damage abuse causes, and its so often about justifying the main character, cause you know, he's not physically abusive so he's a good guy. Like he passes one of the most BASIC requirements for a good spouse, in that he is not PHYSICALLY HARMFUL to be around, so the main character is obviously Jesus Christ among us. Abuse deserves to be treated better than as a stupid justification for asshole main characters to get the girl.

6810,"&gt; Only a man can rape in the English criminal law.

Well, yes and no.  This really needs to be better understood, as it's a lot more nuanced than people typically understand.

Yes, Rape requires that ""[he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1)"".  Quite literally, female humans cannot be charged with Rape, as the offense does not cover ""made to penetrate"".

However, no, women can rape in the UK, it's just not called Rape by the legal system.  The same statute that updated the Rape definition above (Sexual Offenses Act of 2003 for England, there are others for Scotland and Northern Ireland) also created another offense: ""[causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/causing-sexual-activity-without-consent)"".  This law is completely gender neutral, and is far more broad.  Most importantly, all forms of penetrative rape (including made to penetrate) are punishable with the same punishment as the Rape offense under this offense: up to life imprisonment.  If a woman colloquially raped a man, she could still be punished equally to a man who raped a woman, it'd just be called ""causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent"" instead of ""rape"" by the courts.

That said, that distinction does bother some people (me included), as it leads to misunderstandings like that women cannot rape, or, worse, that what a woman charged under this is not nearly as heinous."

6827,"&gt;From 1946 to 1953, at the Walter E.

The children were not told that they were being fed radioactive chemicals; they were told by hospital staff and researchers that they were joining a ""science club"".

&gt;...

&gt;In another study at the Walter E. Fernald State School, in 1956, researchers gave mentally disabled children radioactive calcium orally and intravenously. They also injected radioactive chemicals into malnourished babies and then pushed needles through their skulls, into their brains, through their necks, and into their spines to collect cerebrospinal fluid for analysis."
6828,"Not with that attitude, you can't"
6829,"Stalk their (older) children's phones.

inb4 ""but if they're hiding something isn't it bad?"" Nope! Some kids are gay or trans or otherwise questioning something important that should be a journey they choose to share with certain people. Maybe they're working on a personal project. Hell, maybe they're writing erotic fanfiction! Just don't do this stuff.

And, because some people *still* won't be convinced, I actually know somebody whose older sister went through her phone (unsure why tbh; it wasn't relevant to secrets to begin with iirc) and found messages she sent to a close friend confessing that she had been assaulted as a young child... by a family friend. Older sister blew up and it was a close thing to get her not to tell their mom; she was convinced the little sister was lying. 

If your kid needs to tell you something, they will. Be open and kind and ready to accept what they have to tell you, and they will trust you. Searching through messages without even asking for no apparent reason destroys your relationship, and it's a huge invasion of privacy."

6836,"&gt; Sam and Frances's characters going all Thelma and Louise doesn't make sense, imo. 

MAJOR SPOILIES BELOW

I don't think saying they went ""Thelma and Louise"" really does it justice.

Their decision that they make together in the end of the movie is pretty much the nail in those arcs. Dixon (Rockwell)'s arc isn't just about maturity and acceptance and growth - it's about him desperately wanting to change. He is angry at himself for his past and sees solving Angela's murder and finding closure for Mildred as his way to become a ""good person"" by avenging an innocent girl's death and helping her grieving mother who he had previously shit on.

Mildred's part in that decision on the other hand shows us that all along this has never truly been about solving her daughter's death for her, but wanting catharsis. She wants and has always wanted blood, not justice. If she can't kill the man who did it, killing someone who did something similar is the next best thing. Mildred is frustrated that the case will never be solved - and we are frustrated too. Going after the stranger is the only way she is going to get any kind of closure, so she takes it, because she is tired of living that way. Even if it doesn't work (and probably won't).

The ex-husband's girlfriend says something like ""anger begets anger"" and that's pretty much the theme of the movie. "

He's 78 too, and I'm really proud of how he handles computing mishaps.  He knows to:  1.  reboot  2.  Look for new drivers  3.  call me if 1 or 2 don't work."

6917,"'fun fact' related to the rape of Nanjing:

The Japanese soldiers were doing so much raping that a lot of them were getting STDs, specifically Syphilis, and it was affecting their ability to fight. In order to combat this, Unit 731 started doing studies on Syphilis by injecting prisoners with the disease. Well, because Syphilis is usually transmitted via sexual contact (as opposed to injection), Unit 731 doctors decided that it would be best for the raping soldiers to rape prisoners in the Unit 731 compound (because who wants to have sex specifically to get syphilis), give the prisoners syphilis, and then study them, often performing vivisections (dissections on a live host) to study their syphilis riddled organs"

I was in Boston one day (I‚Äôm a local) and it was st Patrick‚Äôs day weekend. Went to he local Irish pub for festivities and ran into an Irish native, visiting Boston. Naturally my friends and I, already drunk decided to party, and party hard with this guy, who eventually I commented looked a bit like bane. He then proceeded to tell us that on his first night in Boston he went to a bar ACTUALLY DRESSED AS BANE. Showed us pictures and everything. After laughing hysterically for a few minutes he told us that night, he got invited to a party in a neighboring town by some women, turns out it was a fetish party. The owner (a guy) of the house took him on the ‚Äúgrand tour‚Äù that featured sex dungeons, doctors office rooms, and torture chambers. He then said the guy offered him a drink, and forgot everything until he woke up in his hotel, with a bruins jersey on, no sign of the bane costume. I told him he probably got roofied and raped by some creepy fetish guy, he replies ‚Äúoh shit, that‚Äôs possible I guess....another round then?‚Äù

6937,"Ok, so imagine a 2D universe. There is no up or down. Say there are 2D ""people"" wandering around in this 2D universe, and a 3D cone is floating around above this universe in the 3rd dimension. The 2D people cannot perceive the 3D cone because he's outside the universe as far as the 2D people are concerned. Then say the cone decides to get a closer look and flies down through this 2D universe. To him, he's just passing through, but to the people in the 2D universe, a circle has just grown out of nothing, then disappeared.

The key thing there is that the cone is a static object. He can only move. He doesn't bend, stretch, grow/shrink, mould, or anything. It's a static 3D object. However, when passing through 2D space, he becomes animated. He's a circle that can grow and shrink.

Now let's add 1 to all our numbers. We're here sitting in our 3D universe. Now imagine a 4D ""cone"" is floating around in the 4th dimension, looking in on us. He can see around walls and inside solid objects just as the 3D cone could see the interior of shapes in the 2D universe. Now say this 4D cone passes through 3D space. We would see a sphere grow out of nothing, then disappear. In 3 dimensions, the static 4D object becomes animated.

The general principle is that you look at the object in slices. Each ""slice"" of the 3D cone is like a 2D projection of it in 2D space at a given instance - like a stack of pictures representing each frame in a film. It's the same principle with 4D objects, but these ""slices"" are 3D.

Now lets imagine a fairly intricate static 4D object, and we pass it through 3D space. See that car that just drove past?

Any animated 3D object could then theoretically just be a static 4D object passing through 3D space. Rather than just be clever and simple with small examples, let's think bigger.

What if the entire universe and everything in it was just one single colossal, incredibly intricate 4D object. Every instance in the universe is just a slice of this object. We're all just tiny strands of existence within this unfathomably large object. If we were to ever gain the ability to measure or observe anything in 4 dimensions, then we'd be able to not only see anywhere in the universe (observable or not), but also see the past and the future in perfect detail from any perspective.

Of course, the downside is that nobody is alive, existence is a lie, and free will, chance, or fortune don't exist because the entire history and future of the universe is pre-determined as parts of this giant object. Time wouldn't really mean anything either, because time is only seen as passing because of the constant speed at which the universe passes through 3D space. If the universe were to stop moving, then time in this 3D projection of the universe would stop. We wouldn't experience it because our perception of time moves with time itself, but time as perceived by some 3D people that aren't a component of this object would see our universe as to slow to a stop - or maybe even start heading in reverse.

""Who might design and build such an object though?"" you might ask. Well, if you don't mind me cheesing the answer, then consider that the 4D object is in motion through 3D space. That means that in the 4D universe, time is passing and there is movement. That can be abstracted into a 5D object passing through 4D space, and so on up to infinity. For all we know, we could just be the 3D incarnation of what is actually a 3D object passing through 2D space, which is of a static 2D object passing through 1D space.

Quite amazing.  

Having said all that, I could paint (or draw) for the next ten years, and would certainly find no one who would give me a bowl of soup or a bread roll for my work.  So it is probably not that easy. "
6944,"As an aside before I start typing, I‚Äôm super depressed and lethargic right now so I‚Äôm quite excited to write about something that I‚Äôm experienced in. I apologise if this is too long but I‚Äôll leave a TL;DR at the bottom. Also I‚Äôm female and if it seems like I have any bias that isn‚Äôt on purpose.

MEN
In my experience men are a lot more likely to be the bigger person and take responsibility for being wrong when they are legit wrong. They usually apologise and go the extra mile to show that they‚Äôre sorry.
They also hate it if you encroach on their masculinity. Guys like to be, or at least feel like they are, in charge. It ranges from small things like opening a door for them instead of them opening a door for me, up to buying a more expensive gift for Christmas or Valentine‚Äôs Day that will leave them sulky or irrationally blaming me for them not buying as expensive a gift.
To cover the obvious, guys are often more dominant in the bedroom, and much more likely to wanna do kinky stuff like tying me up, but this might just be a preference that I have when I date a guy. (In other words I go for guys when I wanna be submissive, and I go for girls when I wanna be dominant in my relationship).

WOMEN
Just to cover the stuff I mentioned about guys; girls tend to harbour grudges, even when you talk something out like a big fight, girls will not let shit go. I know I do this myself but when I‚Äôm in a relationship with a girl I tend to take the dude‚Äôs role, so I usually only behave that way in relationships with guys.
One of the best things about being with a girl is cleanliness. Guys seem to go completely blind when it comes to cleaning up after themselves or helping to tidy up. In comparison girls immediately want to make sure everything is neat and tidy before moving onto something else. I‚Äôm talking about basic stuff like leaving empty wrappers on the coffee table or just leaving shit lying around that you could pick up.
I hate when someone takes my stuff without asking (obviously) and girls seem to straight steal things and be like ‚Äúoh hehe oops did I forget to tell u I took ALL of your sweaters, 3 tops and 2 pairs of jeans?‚Äù Like for real date girls who aren‚Äôt the same clothes sizes as you.
In the bedroom it‚Äôs again pretty obvious, girls like to be more submissive, also when it comes to oral I‚Äôve for sure noticed a difference where girls just know what to do to hit those sweet spots, and sometimes guys seem like they have literally no idea what they‚Äôre doing and that can be super frustrating when you‚Äôre horny af. 

TL;DR
Guys take responsibility more, are messy, and like to wear the trousers in the relationship.
Girls hold grudges, are a lot more emotionally present, and tend to know how to make me orgasm ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So what am I to do? Steel my heart and leave her? So that I could feel like a real man and live in my own apartment playing video games and wanking furiously day in and day out. Because that is what a real adult does, right? I already did that once, I had severe depression for a year, my conscience was killing me on a daily basis and I couldn't even enjoy my solitude.

If you can read someone and get a feel for their true character, you learn who you can hang out with, who you need to watch yourself around, and the generally toxic people that you need to cut out as much as possible or develop ways to work with.

And do your best to just get along with your coworkers, even if some of them are shitty. You're gonna see these people for 8hrs a day, there's no need to get petty and worked up over the majority of interactions with them. The more the team can get along, the happier people will be to work. "

Even now, after 9 years of sobriety, I would easily pick drugs over sex if I ever fell off the wagon. That's one of the many reasons I'll never touch that shit again. It's better than sex, love, security, dignity, freedom, and so many other things the and average person takes for granted.

If I were to give a message on drugs, I'd tell people to stay away from the hard stuff and prescription pain pills. There's nothing good that can come from it. It changes you completely. Even after you get sober, you don't go back to who you were. It leaves its mark forever. My children will never get to meet the pre-drugs dad."
7042,"When I was 16 we went on a family trip around several states in the US and one night we were at some restaurant in Nashville when my younger sister and I nipped to the toilet.

Whilst in there, my sister was in a cubicle and I spotted something on the wall and said ‚Äúhey, when you come out, see if you can spot the hilarious thing I‚Äôve just seen!‚Äù

Upon coming out, my sister looked around as she washed her hands and then she saw it: a picture of a naked old man on the wall, with a single flap covering his downstairs mix up and a sign saying ‚ÄúLADIES NO PEEKING‚Äù

So of course, we peeked. And there was nothing there. But what we did notice was that an alarm went off immediately and scared the shit out of us. So we had a laugh together, regained our composure and left, assuming everyone else would be none the wiser.

Until some American women on a table nearby started shrieking ‚ÄúTHERE THEY ARE! THOSE ARE THE GIRLS THAT PEEEEEEEKED!‚Äù And my mum and grandparents seemed panicked asking us ‚ÄúWhat happened? What did you do??‚Äù Because apparently the alarm had sounded throughout the restaurant and a giant red lightning in the wall had started flashing.

We didn‚Äôt want to talk about what had happened because at that point we were mortified (and the women on the other table were still shrieking about us which wasn‚Äôt helping the situation) so my mum and grandma went into the toilets themselves and spotted what it was, came out laughing their heads off, and told my grandad and they proceeded to make fun of us for a long time after that.

So I don‚Äôt know if you mentioned the sex shaming robot beause it‚Äôs something you just imagined or if it‚Äôs because these kinds of things are common, but I never knew anything like that existed! And as much as I love the story now, the old man dick shaming alarm mortified me that day. Buzz Lightyear would have been preferable."

I was in an Uber in CDMX and this dude was selling tacos out of a thing hung on his chest, like he was a vendor at an MLB game. No one was buying any and he must've seen me, generic white guy \#3, sitting in the front seat of the Uber. Starts knocking on the window and aggressively trying to open the card door.

Look, I don't know about you, but if you give me a choice between paying for something called a premium and something called a tax, my only question's going to be 'Which one's cheaper?'

If I'm being honest I don't actually have faith in about half the country to think that way

Our culture is so vehemently opposed to taxes that a good portion of people won't even have the thought occur to them that health insurance is in practice a tax already and don't see taxes as something they get an ROI on. Just money that's stolen from them 

Just look at that Republican congressman who suggested abolishing libraries on twitter saying it'll lower taxes and they're not needed because we have amazon. Someone pointed out how much more expensive per month even 1 book bought from amazon is compared to the taxes spent on the library (which is like a couple if cents per person). The congressman's response? ""Yeah but you won't have to pay as much taxes!"""

EDIT: I have looked it up and realised that this isn't actually strictly true:

""Sexual Offences Act 2003 section 9 provides a defence of reasonable belief that the child was over 16, but not if they were in fact under 13. So sex with a child under 13 will be prosecuted""

So basically, there isn't a hard and fast law like some US states, but police won't prosecute unless one participant was 13 or under on the grounds that it is reasonable for the other party to have genuinely believed that they were older."

When she came out of surgery and began to regain consciousness she kept speaking of all these ‚Äúsouls‚Äù that she saw. I remember her saying she was scared for them and wasn‚Äôt sure what would happen to them. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what she said about the souls but I do remember her saying that they had all just died in an accident.
   Her surgery was on August 1, 2007. This was also the day that the I-35W bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, Minnesota (the same city she was in). It collapsed while she was being operated on.

1. My mom has bad body dysmorphic disorder, my brother has now developed it too. We're all adults, and he didn't show the signs until he heavily got into competitive running. My mom also had anorexia as a teen.

2. Mom's been married four times, but only says three. She thinks no one remembers her first husband (married right out if high school, so her kids weren't born yet, but our aunt talked to us about it, thinking we all knew about him)

3. My brother's bio dad is different from the man he was told was his father. He found out when he was close to 30. 

4. Both of my parents had affairs with each other before divorcing their spouses to marry one another.

5. My sister was molested by a family friend when she was 9-10, and my parents' response to her telling them was to send her to a fat camp. 

6. Two of my dad's brothers lived across the street from each other and went almost a decade without speaking due to some unknown grudge.

7. My family's farm ground ran alongside the land of my crazy bachelor cousins. They hated the family and would shoot at anyone from the family that wandered onto their land. Nothing was marked, there were no fences, so this was easy to do. Personally happened to me when I was 12 and out snowmobiling. Scared the crap out of me.

8. My brother got a girl pregnant when they were both 13. My extremely Catholic, pro-life (let's be real, anti-choice) mother paid for the girl to get an abortion. Shocking right? /s

7204,"I was always told that my aunt was never married, but I learned recently that she was married to a man and actually had a son. Her husband was INSANELY conservative, and when their son came out as gay, he completely shunned him. Treated him like total shit, told him how wrong and messed up he was, kicked him out multiple times, etc. One night, my aunt and her husband came home to their son standing in the living room with his father's shotgun to his own head. He said something along the lines of, ""this is your fault dad"" and shot himself in front of them. My aunt left the next day and never said another word to him (her husband) or saw him again.

I remember once at a family reunion my little cousin asked why my aunt didn't have kids, since all of my mom's other siblings did. She didn't say anything and left the room, and the whole place fell silent. I never understood why until my mom told me the story recently. I looked up the obituary of his death and it said that his death was an accident or something."
7205,"Not me but one I witnessed. We had this white trash family living near us. I was 10ish, and friends with the 10 year old son, who magically somehow wasn't a bad kid.

When I say white trash, I mean like his mom was massively overweight and wore nothing but muumuus, his 14 year old sister smoked and had a 1 year old child, and his 3 year old brother, Devin, was the spawn of hell. 

Anytime my friend hung out with me or our group, we had to babysit. I KNOW this kid was the product of his environment, but this 3 year old had the mouth that A sailor would be embarrassed to be around. He would hit, throw tantrums, bite, cuss, try to break toys. Any kid that tried to do anything would have his fat cow of a mother at his parents door, screaming how she was going to call the cops on their kid for touching a little boy (regardless that her son bit one of us hard enough to draw blood)

What follows was a time I have cherished since.

A few of us are playing tag or football or something and keeping an eye on Devin. Well, this older Mexican lady is walking down the sidewalk with a basket of laundry. Devin goes running down the sidewalk and just slams into this woman's legs.

Now, this is an accident on Devins part, he was just running around, and the woman did nothing wrong, she did not see him most likely.

However, Devin bounces off her legs and fall on his butt, looks up at the woman, flips her off, and says ""Fuck you, you bitch!""

You do NOT mess with older Mexican women. She calmly set her basket down, reached down, hauled him to his feet by his shirt, and SLAPPED him across the face so hard it sounded like a thunderclap.

I remember his shocked face for a split second, then him collapsing and wailing. She picked up her basket and walked on.

I collapsed too. I was rolling in the grass, literally crying from laughter.

Yes, he had a bad home life, but his mom's behavior in threatening other families just made him think he could get away with anything. I like to think he learned a bit about the world that day."

7272,"What are you talking about? 

The original trilogy is like THE modern day example of adventure movies done right. Raiders and Grail reserve the supernatural for the very very end of the movie, and they were filmed at a time when all the stunts had to be practical. Because of this everything is totally believable. A stunt man *did* hang on the undercarriage of a truck, they *did* ride the horses like that, he *did* hang off the side of a tank. Its all within the realm of human physical ability. All the sets were actually created in real life. they filmed on location. You can't get a more realistic set of action movies than the Indiana Jones flicks. 

I don't know what you mean by high brow, but the Indiana trilogy doesn't assume you are a complete moron. The characters are intelligent and the plot and writing is on-point. Its an action flick, not a crime drama, but they are still much more sophisticated in their exposition than a lot of their peers.

Cps was even called by my child psychologist because she thought my family may be abusing me and I was no help in figuring that out. When asked I said no one ever hurt me because I literally didn't know. It all came back into my mind over a period of a few weeks after seeing that rape scene from showgirls on  HBO. It started as images in my head, then horrible nightmares about the incident. At that point I couldn't tell they were memories, I thought I was just shook by the scene, I also didn't recognize the man in my nightmares, for a while he was faceless.

It takes a base level of skill to achieve anything at all, and manually holding your jaw open wide enough to keep your teeth away from the skin is like chewing a golfball-sized wad of fairly stiff gum for however long. Plus, a good BJ often involves fully wrapping one's lips around one's teeth\*, and if it's intense enough, the irritation from that can last for days. That's not including using tongue in the right ways, or figuring out how to repeatedly slide a giant sausage partway down your throat without vomiting or even gagging (advanced method is to fake-gag for partners who like it, without accidentally triggering your *actual* gag reflex. I am not proud of this but I have definitely vomited on more than one penis before figuring out how to hit that balance properly).

I take pride in my BJs but I often have my partner give me a jaw massage (and fetch me some water!) as part of the pillow talk/post-sex-cuddles, because, srsly, ow.

(House was super small). At about midnight we heard her wake up and we could hear her feet on the wood floor running to us and then hit the door to open it. To make her not scared of the dark we kind of ‚Äúcelebrated‚Äù her arrival. ‚ÄúYay she‚Äôs awake come play with us woohoo!‚Äù Silence. Nothing. So we open the door and say her name. Nothing. It‚Äôs pitch black. We make our way to the living room and she‚Äôs snoring sound asleep on the couch. Next day my mom goes to our landlord and was told him how she always felt uncomfortable in her room (the closet always felt heavy and sad) and explained the situation the previous night. The landlord then explained two twins had fallen into a cannery and were ground up into these cans.

Mom moved us out a week later.

7457,"I‚Äôm a New Yorker, born and raised in B‚Äôklyn for all of my 42 years, minus 4 when I moved to FL. The day of and after 9/11 blended. I was working in downtown B‚Äôklyn and even if you didn‚Äôt know what had happened, you knew when the city flipped it‚Äôs switch. I remember seeing the throng of people coming from across the Brooklyn Bridge, but what made the biggest impacts those first 48 hours was the overall city atmosphere. 

Not only was the city physically quiet, but there‚Äôs was such a stillness you felt in the people around. Papers and such from the Towers were still floating around and could be found in the backyards going into B‚Äôklyn and Queens. The smell...omg, I will never, EVER forget the smell for my city. You got the smoke and the soot and dust......but you also got that ‚Äúbarbecue‚Äù smell that just stopped you in your tracks cause you knew what that was. Even to this day, when walking around and I pass people‚Äôs yards, it still stops me for a nanosecond. 

Then there was also that feeling of not knowing...not knowing what exactly had happened, what was currently going on, and what else could possibly happen. The stillness of not having cell phone availability and very limited tv added to the quiet. Us as Americans had always been so secure in ourselves and our standing in the world that an event like this was inconceivable. It didn‚Äôt matter that every hour on the news showed war and attacks and bombings in other countries that were their everyday norm. It was inconceivable to begin to apply those possibilities to ‚ÄúUS‚Äù, there was NO thought ever that those could happen here. 
But that day proved us wrong, that not everyone in the world perceived the US as the harmless but sometimes meddling and annoying goody two-shoes. 

And with that, where a previous commenter(s) said that NY went back to normal.....I‚Äôd have to disagree. Yes, we went on with our lives, but for those who are still around who were there back then, I think we all keep a more subconscious eye over our shoulder and even while still enjoying our lives, it‚Äôs a shadow that gets tucked away for the time being. In a city like this, of sooo many people, there‚Äôs huge turnover, and for visitors and new residents the awe and respect of that event is just a moment in history for them so they are establishing their new rhythm here. 

I ended up moving out to FL by the end of 2002. I think the stress of that shadow became too much for me. But I couldn‚Äôt completely stay away, I ended up moving back in 2006. I‚Äôll admit, it‚Äôs still hard to go into that area of lower Manhattan for me. 

We NY‚Äôer are some tough critters though, but we‚Äôve shown that we‚Äôll still keep the world moving. Those first 48 hours shook us up, but shown why we‚Äôre a unique breed. "

My boyfriend and I were driving down a crowded street in the early afternoon, circa the summer of 2016. He was focused on the road, and I was absentmindedly staring out of the window.  As we drive past a field, I saw a dude in a rabbit costume made up like a creepy clown. He was standing on the edge of the field toward the street, facing traffic.
 It was so fucking surreal that I made him turn back to get a look, but in the minute it took him to make a u-turn, Creepy Rabbit Clown was gone without a trace. I know what I saw, but my boyfriend thinks I dozed off.

7496,"This is the most reasonable response I can come up with, coming from someone who has a car with an upgraded exhaust system. For me, loud exhaust systems are for the love, enjoyment, and appreciation of gas/diesel powered cars. I will say with rational drivers that have loud cars (I see myself in this position), there is a level of responsibility they NEED to have when it comes to respecting the noise level of their car when other people are around. I try my best to not disturb my neighbors when I get home late at night, I dont rev my engine, I dont try and disturb anyone and I have not received any complaints or letters because I am being as responsible as I can while still enjoying my car. 

Unfortunately there are too many people who have loud cars that are annoying and audibly disruptive to the communities they are in (aka people revving their engines in populated areas thinking they are cool). Honestly it is something that is hard for people to understand if they are not into cars so I think trying to defend this position to people who are not petrol heads is a challenge. However I can make a similar argument for people who blast loud music late at night in populated areas. Why do you need to have music that loud? Why do you make sound systems that loud if all you do is disturb your neighbors or people around you? Why dont you play loud music in an area that would not be disruptive to the people around you? 

Hopefully I am making a fair argument here. "
7497,"This is not a lie.  

I was in Mobile, Alabama, staying at a hotel for work.  I was in the hotel bar.  On the bar TV was Monday night football.  A guy sidled up to me at the bar and started chatting with me.  It was musician Lyle Lovett.  He was in town for a show.  We talked football, particularly Texas football, which he is a fan of (he went to UT). 

He left and a few minutes later I was sitting at the bar and through the lobby walks Robert DeNiro with a couple other guys.  They talk for a minute, and Robert DeNiro turns to go to the elevator, sees me gawking out of disbelief, smiles, and waves at me while chuckling.  

I turned to the woman at the bar next to me, who I later learn is a local.  ""I think I just saw Robert DeNiro in the lobby.""  With total nonchalance she picks up her wine and says offhandedly, ""Yeah, he's in town again doing another movie.""  

No one in Mobile, Alabama, was even mildly surprised to see Lyle Lovett and Robert DeNiro on the same Monday night in their town.

I was about 14, it was late at night. I was in my sister's room, it had a TV in it. (She's 2 years older than me.) Sister was at a friend's house. 

I'm sitting there on the end of her bed, watching some softcore cinemax movie at like 1am. I'm really going at it. Beating my meat for like 30 minutes straight. As I'm about to cum I see the VHS slot in my sister's TV! I then have the *""great""* idea to stick my dick in there when I blow my load!

So I did...

I ended up getting a cut on my member. I also somehow managed to break the TV. It was a 14"" VHS equipped model (early 00's) the TV wouldn't turn on again. 

My sister never really used the danged thing, so when it got thrown out she didn't get a new one, but no one ever figured out why her TV stopped working."

We're talking hundreds of dollars for a doctors visit or a simple antibiotic, thousands for more serious medications, and tens/hundreds of thousands for expensive medicine and any operations.

A lot of middle class and below people who have a medical emergency end up starting a go-fund-me or hosting other fundraisers in the community to cover the cost, even if they have insurance (this is funny to me, because it's sort of an unregulated form of collectivized medicine happening naturally). I've been to many of these events.

Before the affordable care act, this was more like 18% of people, but this has been a very expensive effort, never really got a full commitment from all the states or insurance companies, and now Trump is doing his best to let it die (after failing to repeal it outright).

People who have decent healthcare are those who are wealthy, have full time jobs (40 hours a week with 1 company), or are under 26 and parents have insurance. Otherwise, you have bare minimum government assisted care or you're just not insured.

So yeah, there's a significant amount of people with shitty healthcare, because it's very hard for them to pay for it. More like 20-30% than the 5% you mention."

We opted to terminate due to my high risk during delivery and wanting to have subsequent children. It‚Äôs a two day process. 

On the first day, I went to the doctor‚Äôs office. That‚Äôs where he started dilating me. Once done in the exam room, he told me to get dressed and come speak to him in his office. My husband and I waited in the Hal outside his office until he called us in. 

Once inside, he proceeded to PLACE a personal phone call. Not answer, he made a call. He talked for a while and then hung up, as we awkwardly sat at his desk.

She had to go to the Accident and Emergency centre at the hospital finally to get a scan and it turned out she had pancreatic cancer, spread to her liver. That same doctor recently saw my mum who had just had surgery for bowel cancer and said she looked like she was healing well despite the mess leaking out of the wound, and the large, bright red, hot to the touch area around the wound.

* Optimus Prime has all the colors of the American flag and represents common sense and idealism, and he is also a reluctant (but amazing) warrior who is in it for the long haul (he is literally a truck)
* Most other Autobots are either flashy vehicles (consumerism), aid services (police, medical services, fire trucks) or military vehicles, mostly in primary, fresh colors
* The Decepticons mostly have secondary (derivative) colors and Megatron is all white with a white hood and red eyes (fascism, white supremacy)
* Megatron is also a metaphor for the impotence of fascism in its phallic imagery, since he cannot move in alternate mode and is just a huge, useless gun, to be fired only by his quisling second-in-command, Starscream, who is himself a homophobic caricature, so appropriate for firing the phallic gun of fascism
* Many Decepticons feature weird alternate modes (e.g. Shockwave), are parasites (the Insecticons, the abominations, the Stunticons came from a junkyard IIRC), outdated military hardware or are just faceless clones of each other
* The sub-set of the Constructicons are not destructive, though? No, they represent fear of unionization of workers, as symbolized by their gestalt, which is very powerful, lumbering and also incredibly dumb

7773,"&gt;- A plaintiff with a valid cause of action should pursue it with reasonable diligence.

&gt;- By the time a stale claim is litigated, a defendant might have lost evidence necessary to disprove the claim.

&gt;- Litigation of a long-dormant claim may result in more cruelty than justice. 

These are the commonly cited reasons for the Statute of Limitations. Depending on jurisdiction, there are exceptions to the Statute of Limitations for certain crimes. Changes to the law are being considered for child sexual abuse, due to the fact that it's unreasonable to expect a child to always be able to bring a case against their abuser while still underage. One example is making the statute of limitations only start once the victim turns 18.

TL;DR, it's to ensure that the prosecutors/accusers can't bring a case where any evidence the defendant could use to counter the prosecution is lost to time."

But boy, did this house need some work. The year prior, the laundry room had caught fire and destroyed the master bed/bath, dining room, and of course the laundry room, and that part of the house was just boarded up when we moved in. There were two other bedrooms, a bathroom, living room, and kitchen, so I didn't mind too much. I was desperate to get out of my mom's house and I knew we'd be ""fixing it up"" soon. My friend and I painted our rooms, the bathroom, and the kitchen. Scraped the popcorn ceiling off of all the habitable rooms and patched a crack in my bedroom's ceiling. Patched other holes and replaced some light fixtures and outlets. We were about to redo the walls (plaster from the 50s) and replace the carpet in the living room when the landlord got shipped off to Afghanistan for a year. My own dad helped us as much as he could, but he's no homebuilder. He and I were working on some things here and there one Saturday while my roommate was at work, and we discovered two things. One, there was a legit hole in the wall the size of a mini fridge in the destroyed dining room that I hadn't seen before (fire damage, we didn't go past the kitchen), where anything could just be coming into the house. And second, my roommate was keeping food in her bedroom, and she would stuff boxes, wrappers, and *half-eaten snacks* in between her bed and the wall, and there were roaches in her room. When I confronted her about it, she immediately jumped on the defensive but simultaneously shirked ALL of her household responsibilities. Quit cleaning, quit doing dishes, wouldn't take the trash out, her room became a bottomless pit. We fought and fought and she eventually moved out, told Daddy I kicked her out, and he started paying her rent in a nice downtown high-rise. He said I could still live in his house, but I'd be responsible for all bills, including rent. I said ""fuck that"" and got my own apartment, leaving all of my books, furniture, and electronics behind because of the bugs. My first night in my new apartment, I sat on the floor with my dog and ate Crazy Bread from Little Caesar's for dinner. Best night of my life. Now, three years later, I can say that this apartment's best quirk is that the ceiling is not soundproof whatsoever. That same night, the first night I lived here, I sneezed, and the man that lives above me said, ""Bless you."" I also can hear him pee every single morning while I'm doing my makeup."

'On 2 August, Chikatilo killed a 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, to the banks of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a shortcut to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal.[83] Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth.[84] Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl.[84] Within two weeks, an 11-year-old boy named Aleksandr Chepel had been found on the banks of the Don River, strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, just yards from where Alexeyeva's body had earlier been found[84] before a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, was killed in Aviators' Park on 6 September.'"

Cameras are positioned weeks in advance, and everything EVERYTHING is timed to the second on award shows (seriously they have to run like a Swiss watch just to go 15 minutes over time).

The times will come when you are so angry at your loved one that you just want to scream or smack them one.  Or you're bored with them and in your head you're thinking, I don't love them any more. You're looking at them and thinking, why am I here?  Lots of things cause a marriage or relationship to go stale.  Here's the advice:  Every day think to yourself I'm going to love this person today.  I may not be feeling it, but I am going to love them.  Sometimes you may have to do this for a long time because the starry eyed love stage is not happening.  But, then, guess what?  It comes back.  And it's like you're newly in love all over again."

Then we got turned around and a little lost trying to find our way out and suddenly things were NOT fine. My own friend started to visibly panic, which of course attracted a lot of unwanted attention. We had numerous men coming up to us, grabbing our arms and offering to 'show us the way.' 

They might have been completely innocent in their intentions, but the combination of not knowing where we were and the sudden realization that we were in a very vulnerable position in a foreign country was sobering.

8089,"There is an interesting evolutionary theory for why this is the case.

Squids and other Cephalopods are Molluscs, and the thought is that their common ancestor was something that looked very much like a snail.  Snails have a ganglion (collection of nerves - akin to an invertebrate ""brain"") associated with their eyes and another ganglion associated with their foot.  

As squid are visual predators, their ocular ganglion grew in size to handle all of the information coming in quickly. Since the single foot of their snail-like ancestor is now split into many tentacles, their foot ganglion also had to grow to have the capacity to [control it well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK6h1DN5nQU).

And since their hunting requires good integration of the visual and tentacle-motor systems, the neurons connecting these two ganglia also multiplied.  It just so happens that in the snail-like ancestor, the esophagus passed in between the two ganglia.  There was plenty of space, so there was no immediate evolutionary constraint to keep this from happening.  But in the squid descendants that we see today, the growth of both ganglia and the connecting neurons on either side form the ring-shaped brain described above.

This is an excellent example of what Evolutionary Biologists call a [spandrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_\(biology\))."

8322,"I worked at a retailer.

I had one manager who had two settings: grandmotherly, or fucking pissed. There was no middle ground. I know this, because on several occasions I'd make note of her mental state and if a customer had stupid shit they demanded to ask about (ie: price matching two wildly different units), I'd say ""please be nice."" as they were coming with me to meet the customer....

Anyhow, I worked selling computers, printers, speakers, etc. Tech stuff. One of the metrics we were evaluated on, of course, was overall budget and returns vs. sales. Anyhow, one day, an employee from another store decided to drop by Saturday evening (the refresh cutoff for the week) and return a set of $300 high end speakers they'd purchased but didn't like.

I was on till. As with most returns, I called a manager up (as I didn't really know how to do employee discounted stuff in returns). It was her, and she was having NONE of it.

Keep in mind, while in Bird language, this is known as a ""dick move"", it was not actually prohibited for him to return the speakers in this way. But doing it at what wasn't your own store was really.... not nice.

Anyhow, I had to be there for like 12 minutes while they argued back and forth and it was just really fucking cringey and I didn't want to be there. All I could do at the end of it was give one of those white people ""omfg, I'm sorry, please, I'm not affiliated with this"" half-smiles."

8443,To catch them is my real test... 
8444,"Here are a couple of tips off the top of my head:

 - Learn to use Google's markup for search terms. For example, adding a minus sign before a keyword (like -this) will remove results with that keyword (if what you're looking for shares keywords with another more popular search term), and putting something ""in quotes"" mandates that the exact phrase you typed shows up in the results. Typing terms like ~this shows results for similar keywords, which can help you find what you want.

 - Try to figure out which keywords are most relevant to your query. For example, looking up an error message - people tend to include things like programs they were using or the model of computer they have, which absolutely might be the cause of the problem, but shouldn't be conflated with the issue itself. If you're looking it up anyways, you probably don't know where the error came from, so make sure to try searching for just the message and look for potential similarities in the results to your own scenario.

 - On that note, mix up your keywords. Including too many keywords (especially subjective ones like for example ""scary"" when looking up a movie you don't remember the name of) makes it harder to find results, because fewer pages are likely to have everything you typed in. Google tries to abstract on that a little bit, but it isn't a miracle worker. Try several combinations to make sure you cover your bases."

As well, Fred finds there where whole chapters that his grandfather skipped that contained mildly sexist/racist stuff, plus violence and sex, so we get to see scenes restart as Fred changes it on the fly - characters being recast, setting changes, a sex scene is awkwardly changed in two characters playing checkers.

When I was fourteen years old I auditioned to be in the high school play. It was the musical 'Oklahoma'. I was dead set on being Ado Annie. If you don't know, this is a bit of a rambunctious character. 

And I was an awkward shy little twig of a girl at the time, but I thought 'fuck it let's go'. I was in it to win it. Balls to the wall. This is my moment. 

Our drama teacher had us audition in front of each other. And some people actually laughed when I got up. And I looked our drama teacher dead in the eye and asked 'do you want the accent?' - meaning the southern style accent. Like in the movie. 

Nobody else did the accent during the auditions for any character - and I thought that was weird. So I did it. And I did it well. But I was the only one. 

I did not get the part. I got a smaller speaking role in the end. I cried.

8479,"6th grade, 5 a.m. The sound of someone knocking on our glass door at the living room wake me up. I get off my bed, walk down the stair and see the girl from across the street - short hair, chubby. She stand there, staring at the unlit living room for a few seconds, then dash off.  Confused, I walk across the street, pressing on their door bell, ready to ask about her weird action on a Sunday morning. Her grand mother greets me with annoyance in her voice, telling me her grandchild is still sleeping on her bed. 

The story speads around the neibourgh, and not a single soul believe I had seen the girl at my door at 5 o'clock in the morning."
8480,"Yeah I‚Äôve been there. Sorta. I was really good friends with this girl for a couple years and one night she was begging me to stay over, but I had to work early. I just assumed she wanted the company because prior to this we‚Äôd never done anything. At all. 

So I left and as I‚Äôm like 10 minutes out she texts me ‚Äúif you had stayed you probably would‚Äôve gotten lucky..‚Äù

THE FUCK!? Now you tell me??

So I spend the better part of three months trying to get her back into that mood, from that night. But every time I made a move she wasn‚Äôt feeling up to it or there was something going on with her family. 

Well one night I invited her to go to a Florida Georgia Line concert with me. At this point I‚Äôd given up trying to hit the home run because it was disappointment central. Indecisive behavior. Interested and not interested. Hung up on an ex that lives on the other side of the country kinda crap. Whatever back to being friends. 

Well she gets super drunk because she snuck a bottle of whiskey into the concert inside her boot. Before FGL actually comes out she starts grabbing my dick through my pants and saying rather obnoxiously loud, even for a concert, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna fuckn ROCK yur wurld latr‚Äù. Guy behind me pats me on the back in congratulations. All fucking right.

Well long story short is that I only got mildly drunk and I ended up having to carry her out of the concert. Like full on princess style. I took out her phone. Called her mom to come pick her up, because I was in no shape to drive in fairness, and explained that I would just walk home. My buddy came and picked me up about halfway home. We hit the bar, and I went home with some random girl, and my buddy went home with that girls mom. So it wasn‚Äôt a total loss. 

Next morning he tells me that I lucked out, because he had already fucked the friend I took to the concert a while back. Several times in fact (he‚Äôs more of a man whore than me). He described her as ‚Äúa dead fish‚Äù and a ‚Äúsandbag‚Äù. After that I stopped pursuing the notion all together. "

We are about to enter the first dungeon.  It is old and moss-covered, as fantasy dungeons are wont to be.  The entrance is a gaping maw of stone, with no light inside.   We draw closer, wary of what dangers may lie beyond the threshold-- Skeletons? Goblins? Gelatinous Cubes?  We cannot see inside. There is a noise from the dark and we are caught by surprise by the enemy. The foe leaps onto my ex‚Äôs ranger, and sinks its teeth into him for some paltry amount of damage. It‚Äôs a dire rat!

My ex flips his shit.  ""RATS!?"",  he cries, ""It's stupid RATS!?""

My jaw drops at his reaction.  I thought this was a clever bait-and-switch from the DM.  The other player and I try to calm this man-child.  Yeah, it's rats, we say.  Let's just get on with it.  For the love of god, sit down and stop yelling about it.  He is having none of it, continuing to throw his tantrum about how it's SO STUPID we have to fight these DAMN RATS when we are HEROES.  All our pleading, all our cajoling, falls on deaf ears.

8537,"My dad clinically died for over a minute as a result of an iodine drip during a procedure, despite a documented severe iodine allergy. He described it as an out of body experience in which there was complete silence and he was the spectator in the upper corner of the room, watching the staff scramble to revive him. He said he had no concept of time or of the panic below, he just observed in total peace. He saw one nurse (finally) notice his bracelet and alert everyone of what the issue was. They cut the drip and continued their efforts to revive him. 

During this time, even though he was watching the end of his life, he felt an extreme peace, and was pain free for the first time in years. He was aware that he was dying, and he was ready and content. Everything got bright and he started to float upwards, until he saw a man that he didn‚Äôt recognize who told him it wasn‚Äôt his time yet. 

All at once, he was jolted back into his body and came to. Once stable, he described what he witnessed and even thanked the particular nurse that noticed his allergy alert bracelet. They were all baffled that he knew such detail. 

I can only hope that when he did pass away four years ago, it was an even more peaceful experience than this. It gives me peace knowing death was something that he had faced already, so he wasn‚Äôt scared of it when it came again. "

I wholly recommend to every single person in existence trying at least one psychedelic (preferably DMT, shrooms, or LSD if just once).

I guess it may make me sound a bit dumb or shallow, but the very first time I  took a psychedelic (pure liquid LSD), I felt... awake. I felt like a good, genuine human being. I experienced what it was like to be truly happy (I later came to the realization I have been depressed for most if not all of my memory before that day). And honestly... I can't remember what it was like to exist before. How I thought, what I perceived, the things I cared about most. They all changed dramatically. For the better. It feels as though I shouldn't be saying that - like wow,  you weren't able to do that without drugs? But I am, and I don't know if I could have done it without them. Maybe with meditation or with therapy, but those were also something I only started because of my experience. So it's possible I never would have grown in that way.

Remember when you were a kid and life had a sort of... vividness to it? The world was rich in colours, sounds, and smells, and full of endless opportunities. But as you got older, those senses became dull when faced with the battle of life and realization of how the world really works. The depth and wonder of the world was stripped away layer by layer.

The moment I began to feel the effects of the drug, my perspective was completely stripped away. I was still me, I still had my knowledge, my memories, and my emotions. But it was as if I was experiencing the world for the first time. It was as if I'd never noticed the beauty in the trees, or the strength in disaster, or the pain in other's lives, or the wisdom of the universe itself. It quite literally stripped me of my ego and forced me to look at the universe and understand my existence and consciousness in an entire different way. I was able to see how the way I perceived the world and others severely affected my life. It taught me that none of have any sort of control on this shitshow we call life and that we don't get to choose the way universe itself plays out. But there is one thing we can do and that is choose how we affect other beings lives. I was humbled when I was forced to deal with the horrible way I had been treating myself and others (not that I was necessarily a bad person, but I realised that I had put so much negativity and judgement out into the world and towards every other person because of things being out of my own control, and that in turn caused a lot of the pain I held onto in my mind). I learned kindness and, more importantly, empathy - something we all seem to let go of so quickly. I learned how to give without expecting anything. I learned how to let go of the things stressing me out in my life and just experience the world and live for once.

Sometime a couple years later I dosed an extreme amount of LSD, I believe it was around 450ug (4x what I took the first time - I had dabbled with shrooms and mdma by then but never taken a ""heroic dose"" of any psych). I experienced ego death that day. If you don't know what it is - it's essentially feeling your entire existence... stripped away. You fully believe that you are dead. When I experienced it, despite being utterly terrified of death prior, I accepted it. Embraced it, even. I remember experiencing... locked memories. I remember living out some of my greatest memories simultaneously. Hundreds of events in my life, most that I could never have remembered even with people trying to explain them to me, most that I still can't remember after that day (I've got a shit memory, always have). I remember an intense and strong feeling of connection with myself at all points in my life, as if time itself did not exist and my existence was just... existence. No past or future, just me. And then I remember, similar to many of the comments here, my consciousness molding and moving, eventually forming a point in the center of my forehead, and suddenly there was an overwhelming nothingness. No sense in my entire body other than a feeling of warmth, or comfort. I could have been told I was there for days, months even, and I would have believed it. Of course it had been about thirty minutes long of this (according to my friends, who stated I laid down and closed my eyes after saying ""I'm experiencing my existence again"" which I assumed to be the point where my memories played out) and as my consciousness expanded again when I ""woke up"" I remember feeling that same intense connected feeling, but instead of to myself in the past, I felt it at various and infinite points in both my past, present, and future. I don't recall ever experiencing any visions or ""memories of the future"", however I sometimes get vivid flashbacks to that day and feel that same feeling of connection. Ever since then, I have just felt as though death is not the end, and that consciousness, regardless of the dimension of time, is infinite and what we interpret as life or death has very little effect on it's existence - even if it is presented in a different way. It has surely paved the way for my re-admission into college to discover more about how the universe itself functions, and our own minds. Two of the biggest mysteries.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I have never once had an excuse to tell anybody about this experience, so I hope you enjoyed. I hope it sheds some light on how psychedelics connect you to different perspectives and can be used as a tool to overcome fears or thought patterns."

I started by doing just some push-ups in the morning and as it started becoming routine I would add another exercise. Take things one step at a time and try not to do too much all at once. I know a lot of people mention exercise as if it cures all mental illness which it surely does not but for me I found doing some type of endurance exercise allowed me to just shut my mind off and not focus on my depression. Running to exhaustion or doing some type of body weight exercise with minimal breaks really helped to just relieve the mental strain of fighting back the depression constantly because it simply just allowed me to not focus on it. Really hope your mental health improves and good luck!
8635,"Just an FYI, the Canadian Medical Protective Association is government subsidied. Government sponsored. The provincial governments sponsor this and pay a portion of the fees for all doctors, while in other countries doctors obtain private practice insurance. The government also set a punitive damages cap of $300,000 for medical malpractice claims. The government ALSO created a law that the victim is unconditionally responsible for the doctor and CMPA's legal fees in the event they lose the suit which is designed to discourage patients from suing out of fear of the massive cost of losing. 

So yeah, the government is definitely in large part responsible for making it difficult for a patient to obtain damages in a malpractice suit.

8679,"Be careful. People are fast to recommend stuff like shrooms, LSD or DMT. They don't really have a lethal dose or anything like that, you won't be able to overdose and your body won't be physically harmed from these drugs.

But it's strong shit. It's not just hallucinations or weird out of body experiences. It will mess with your mind. In a good way for most people (myself included). They can be awesome and you can come out of a psychadelic trip with some valuable and positive lessons that will stay with you for the rest of your life.

But they can also take your mind to very bad places. And some people don't come back from there. That probably sounds more menacing than it has to be and the majority (by far) of people won't experience a negative impact on their psychological health. But i don't really like it when people act like there's no risk to taking these very powerful drugs.

If your mind is already in a bad place or you have some (family) history of mental health problems, you certainly should be very careful with these drugs since they can have a very strong impact on your brain chemistry and it can be very difficult to anticipate the impact if there's already stuff not working the way it should work.

There are certainly cases were these drugs are even helpful with mental health problems. They can work wonders with stuff like PTSD and all kinds of issues. But i wouldn't really recommend self-medication.

edit: i actually have no experience with DMT, but after everything i heard about it, it seems to be pretty powerful. Probably doesn't hurt to treat it similar to shrooms and LSD and to consider your mental state at the moment."

8743,"Man they are the WORST. My husband and I rented a UBox to store our apartment in while we were working in another state for several months. After working we went back to get our box and tow it to our new home a few hours away. The day we were leaving was when they chose to tell us we couldnt tow the box and that we had to ship it. A $50 trailer rental that we could have and were planning on returning to the original location turned into a $700 shipping charge. So we bit the bullet and shipped the box. Then they fucking lost it! They lost our box with everything we owned except for our suitcases. They couldnt track it or find it. For a week we go around and around and then they find our box in BROOKLYN, and CHARGE US TO SHIP IT TO US IN PENNSYLVANIA. In the mean time we have to travel to Tennessee for my sisters wedding (for which I have to buy a new dress and my husband had to rent a suit because everything was in the fucking box). They shipped our box to the closest location to us in PA and charged us for the extra days of storage because we couldnt pick it up for a week because we were halfway across the country. When we FINALLY get our box we take the cover off to find that in shipping someone had punched a forklift through the front of our box and put a hole in my (audio engineer) husband's subwoofer cabinet. I spent WEEKS on the phome talking to people, all of whom assured me we would get a full refund and they would file the claim on the subwoofer. We get punted around until it comes out that the ones responsible for issuing our refund are the idiots at the original store who sent our box to Brooklyn in the first place! They refused to issue a full refund and instead offered us the $25 a day for every day your box is late fee which came to $400 by their reckoning because it wasnt their fault that we went to tennessee and couldnt pick up our 2 week late box. And they nevet filed the claim on the subwoofer. The manager also talked over me on the phone the entire conversation and when I said I needed to speak to his boss he said ""why dont you put your husband on the phone?"" All told: $400 refund for $100/month rent on box for 6 months (that we had to pay an extra month for because of the bullshit), $700 initial shipping fee, $300 additional shipping fee after they found the box, and $200 in storage for a week because the delivery location ""wasnt equipped to store UBoxes.""

8749,"I can only speak for the state University I taught at: there is no weed out class. There are classes where the rubber hits the road so to speak, where we start having expectations that you know a few things and know the general structure of homework and tests. But it's not like we sit together and scheme and say we're going to fail X percent or anything.

Edit: okay I'm getting lots of responses so I want to clarify a few things. I love academia (but not academics) and I love college and I think a lot of you have some misconceptions about it. If you don't care - carry on, this is not me trying to talk to you about what your calc 2 teacher said.

Think of college as two distinct segments. There's the general knowledge and then there's the major knowledge.

General knowledge courses - especially at tier 1 research universities - are trying to satisfy requirements from several majors all at once. So any major that requires that course will have a stake in the syllabus. You know how they say Congress is vicious? Sit in on a general education course syllabus overhaul and we'll show you vicious. The sponsoring department in the end has to find a way to balance the input from those factions in with what they need to teach their students. So it's not that general section professors want to weed people out, it's that they are trying to satisfy lots of majors in a finite amount of time. That's why they sometimes seem to throw something completely out of left field at the last moment into your syllabus and insist on covering it.

For your in-major courses, they are trying to teach you general knowledge for that particular field. So I know engineering in particular - this means they scratch the surface of everything that's deemed important. Again, lots of stakeholders - the individual groups within a department, input from steering committees, input from businesses, and based on what other universities teach which gives them an edge (senior projects, anyone?!). 

None of this is personal. There's no secret cabal purposefully making courses harder to get people to drop out. It does take work ethic in all majors and if you're not going to put in the time, you're going to fail. That's just... College. 

Lastly, if you're attending a tier 1 research university, this is par for the course. These institutions exist to do research and produce researchers. They expect some amount of independence. It's not that they want you to fail, it's that they don't care if you pass. They are not there to guide you through your degree. If this is not what you want - go to a different type of school. There's community college, private college, teaching-focused college, liberal arts college, commuter college. And if you're not sure about a school - ask! Ask professors, ask students, ask guides, ask the internet. 

Alright I'm gonna get off my soapbox. "

8831,So the purpose of shampoo is to get dirt and oils out of your hair. That's great for making sure it's clean and not oily but it also makes it really dry and damages your hair if you only shampoo. Conditioner then adds in hydration in the form of different oils that reduce the damage done. So when you use a 2-in-1 it kinda half asses both of these jobs. I'd highly recommend trying using a separate shampoo and conditioner if you currently use a 2-in-1. But it's more for making sure you have healthy soft hair rather than making it smell good and stuff. There's also a fair bit of debate about the benefits of shampoo in general though so there's groups like r/nopoo who say shampoo shouldn't be used in the first place.

8841,"Has anyone seen the movie *Beyond a reasonable doubt?*

It wasn't that popular or particularly good, but I thought the twist was insane and never saw it coming.

Spoilers ahead:

It's the story of a journalist who sets out to prove that the prosecutors office and the police plant tons of evidence to convict murderers. He sets himself up to look like he committed a murder he hears about on the news, but has secret proof that he's innocent, to prove that they fabricate evidence. 

The movie convinces you that the twist is &gt;!the prosecutor successfully destroys the evidence/murders everyone that knows he faked it, and he gets sent to death row. But, at the last second, his new girlfriend saves the day with some proof that he didn't do it.!&lt;

Then, in literally the last seconds of the movie, &gt;!his girlfriend is in bed with him watching some TV when she sees an old story he did, and surprise: the murder victim is his source. Turns out he DID murder the person, and did all the work to get himself exonerated (no double jeopardy). She has no proof but tricks him into confessing while secretly on the line with 911.!&lt;

Then the movie cuts to the credits. Craziest twist I never saw coming (ok, sixth sense is better but that's a beaten horse)."

Of course, we could cut down on the overall defense spending if the EU didn't rely so heavily on our military as well as keeping call outs to countries in distress down, but the repercussions for that would paint us further in a bad light... damned if we do, damned if we don't. "

8861,"Preventative maintenance on my car. Spent $2,100 so my dad &amp; I wouldn't have to spend 16 hours doing the work ourselves in the drive way.

**Backstory**: I like to do as much of the work myself. I've done my brake pads, spark plugs, brake pump, etc. I took my car in for a regular check up at the dealer and they told me about a thing that should be replaced; control arm bushings. I say ""Thanks, I'll do it myself."" and go on my way. I also decided to replace my struts and shocks at the same time too.

Look up tutorials and buy the parts online ($400). The parts come and I wait a few weeks for the weather to be clear and my dad to be available. We get started and immediately realize this is a bigger job than we were led to believe. We put the car back together and I start calling for shops to do the work.

Lots of shops said no, because of the liability using customer supplied parts. Other shops said ""no"" because it was a lot of work. One shop quoted me $760 but that seemed really low. I also didn't go with them because they were a catch-all car repair center. I suspected they'd cut a few corners. There are some bolts that once they come off, they can't be reused.

I found a shop that quoted me $1400. Specialized with my car make and could fit me in ASAP. I went back and forth on whether I should do it because my car is only worth $3500. I eventually decided to do it, because if I were to buy another car, $3500 wouldn't get me the same quality car I have now. It's also the first major maintenance I've had to do since owning the car (5yrs &amp; 50k miles). I figured $1,400 was worth it since I plan on keeping the car for another 5-10 years.

I took the car in to the shop. They called me up during the repair, said they found other issues and if it was OK if they fixed them. I said yes.

Total came out to $2100. They showed me the parts they removed and the new parts on the car (where applicable). I was happy. I checked the paperwork the dealer gave me and one of the parts the shop replaced was a part the dealer informed me about as needing replacement, of which I had forgotten. I'm confident, that had my dad &amp; I done the work we wouldn't have replaced it. 

We would have had to wait a week for the part to come in. And the second part they found my dad &amp; I could have easily missed. All-in-all, $2100 was worth paying someone to do this for me. My dad &amp; I would have toiled under the sun and killed a weekend or more. This shop did it in 6 hours (over two days but it's not two 8 hour days!).

It was really her older sister's, but she let L wear it. L would wear it to, like, the 70s dance and other  themed school dances. She was also generous enough to loan it out to other friends. Everyone was cool about it, except ""M."" She LOVED this dress. LOVED. THIS. DRESS. So when it was loaned to her, she held on to it for awhile. Then something came up and L asked for it back and M basically said ""no, I really like it and I'm not giving it back."" That was it. No explaining that it was really the sister's dress, that you can't just do that, etc. ""It's mine now."" So M kept the dress and the friendship was over.

8867,"Here‚Äôs my personal take on the matter: 


If you put a cat in a box, it doesn‚Äôt make the box sentient. If you take a box, create a sentient cat out of it, and place it in said box, the box is sentient because the cats sentience was literally created by the box. If the box wasn‚Äôt sentient, it couldn‚Äôt create a sentient being. 


The universe is sentient not because we are in it, but because *we were created by it*. We are literally the universe. The atoms in our eyes, bodies, and minds came from the exact same place as the atoms in rocks and trees. We are literally part of the universe, not just visitors stopping here. Aka, the universe is sentient. 


Saying the universe isn‚Äôt sentient because rocks and trees aren‚Äôt is like saying humans aren‚Äôt sentient because our hands aren‚Äôt. The only part of our body that is sentient is our brain. But humans are still called sentient. Rocks and trees are like the universes hands and feet while humans are the universes brain. The way we learn to control and manipulate our bodies is the same way scientists control and manipulate the universe and our environment. Our bodies are dictated by physics and chemistry in the same way the rest of the universe is. Learning how to grow a tree in the most biologically efficient way is the same concept as learning how to grow a muscle in the most biologically efficient way. It‚Äôs the same physics and chemistry but applied to a different application. 


So if a human is sentient because it contains one sentient part, why is the universe not sentient even though it contains a sentient part? The universe was born with the recipe for sentience stored in its chemical and physical make up, which allowed us to come into existence. If the universe contained no sentient properties, it wouldn‚Äôt have the materials necessary to create our sentience. 


In my understanding, if the universe did not create our sentience, something else had to. So you either have to believe in a sentient universe or a sentient being that was capable of creating our consciousness. "

He's 27, still lives with our parents, and he is totally dependent on them. Living with them wouldn't even be so bad in itself (since housing/rent is fucking expensive) but for a long time he didn't even have a job and was working part-time up until very recently.

TBH I would say that I was pretty sheltered as a kid too - and I commuted to university so I lived with my parents until I was 21, but I was determined to move out the moment I graduated and did so. He just never felt motivated to do that and my parents never pushed him to until years later.

My Dad asked him why, he just screamed ""I don't know! Just don't go!"", then my Dad ignored him and walked outside our house anyway but my brother screamed really hard the neighbors went outside. My Dad then decided to skip work and just when he's about to go inside our house, 2 speeding cars from different ways on the road in front of my house crashed onto each other, swerved to our front yard, and fatally injured both drivers. Then my brother went back to  play the lego, he wasn't curious at all about what happened in front of our house. He grew up pretty normal to me despite what happened, though."

Sometimes what is best for them in the long term is to hit rock bottom now and get their shit straight, then maybe you need to let them work themselves to that place before they'll learn. If you want them to stop using meth, you can't be their friends about it. You need to be a dick, the biggest dictator around. Addicts are rarely accountable for their behavior, so happily hold them accountable. It's a disease and a choice and if you let them pretend that they have zero self control and no influence over the matter, that's just going to be an excuse to keep using.

The Portuguese were the real pioneers of exploring (in Europe at least) and had been sailing since the 1450s, a good 40 years before Columbus. They had bases in Africa and Asia and developed the first real global empire.

When the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in 1494, two years after Columbus landed in the new world, it had one purpose: to divide the earth outside of Europe between Spain and Portugal. They did this by effectively drawing a line on the globe, where everything east of that line would belong to Portugal and everything to the west to Spain.

If you look at this meridian on a map today, you'll see that most of the americas belongs to the Spanish, except for a small piece of Brazil. Now, there is no way the Portuguese would know that land was there if Columbus was the first so they would have had some incredible luck. Yet they pushed for the meridian to be where it is today. Because of this they eventually came to own modern day Brazil."

Suddenly two of the crows broke off from the group and flew some distance down the road to where several sea gulls were sat on a roof.

The crows began dive bombing the gulls, angering them. The gulls chased the crows who flew back to the main group and the bread.

Once the gulls saw the bread they forgot about the crows and began fighting amongst themselves to get the bread- and in the process tearing it into pieces.

The crows then stole the smaller pieces, sometimes in midair and sometimes off the ground.

9014,"There's actually a couple interesting things that could happen during difficult poops. Let's assume you are constipated and head to the toilet, determined to finally get this monster shit out.

When you bear down while pooping, several things happen. You breathe in, hold it, tighten your abs and intercostal muscles (muscles between your ribs), and bend forward slightly. This increases pressure in your abdomen, hopefully forcing out the excessively large poo. 

This does slightly raise your blood pressure briefly, however this is not the dangerous part. Bearing down also raises pressure in your chest, putting pressure on your heart. The pressure doesn't let your heart pull in as much blood, so you can't pump effectively.

Your heart speeds up, trying to push out more blood, and your blood vessels get tight, to try and raise the pressure. But you're still focused on that monster shit and are still trying to push. The pressure on your chest (and thus your heart) raises. Your heart still can't pump enough, so your blood vessels keep contracting in a vain attempt to get pressure up. 

Right about now, you realize you can't hold your breath forever. It's time to regroup and come at this bowel movement from a new angle. You relax your muscles and breathe out all that air you were holding in. 

Suddenly, the pressure in your chest drops. There's nothing stopping your heart from getting a full pump in. So it fills up, goes for it, and BOOM. Pushes a nice big heartload of blood out. All is right again.

Wrong. Your blood vessels are still all contracted. That initial pump of blood causes a huge increase in blood pressure. 

Now, say you had a weakened blood vessel in your brain. This massive increase in blood pressure causes a blowout and you start bleeding in your brain. This is a stroke. It causes brain damage.

But that's not the only way. Even with you being perfectly healthy, and you can handle that spike in blood pressure without a stroke, you're not safe yet. As soon as your body realizes that your blood pressure has spiked, your heart is beating a million times per minute, and there's really no reason for it, two things happen. Your heart chills the fuck out, and slows down. And your blood vessels realize the world isn't ending, and they relax.

This all sounds like a good thing. But it's  not. Your blood vessels weren't  expecting your heart to chill like that. And your heart wasn't expecting them to relax. They both calmed down too fast, you get a sudden decrease in blood pressure. Your brain stops getting enough blood, says ""For fuck's sake,"" and goes to sleep.

You fall forward, hit your head on the floor in front of you, and get brain damage that way.

Your specific pattern of energy in your brain that you want to call 'you' will never be immortal and you wouldn't really want it too if you think about it. For that state of you to be forever it would require no change, no learning, no growing. Once you learn, that state is not the previous state. You are different person in the sense of the you that is your pattern of energy has changed.


And the effects of you ripple out through the environment you affected, helping others to grow or preventing others from growing. 


So each moment of the you that you are is a moment where your affects will ripple through the entire universe (literally). And then that you is gone from that moment and a new you is created from the feedback of those ripples. The process repeats.


Technically everything is the exact opposite of futile and everything you do, say, and even think, has some affect on the world around you and then yourself.


So what affect will you make? Will you help others grow and therefor create patterns of energy where people, including yourself, can grow and thrive? Or will you take anything you can from the world around you and deprive them and yourself the opportunity of being better? 


Yes, I agree. Life is what we make it. Let's make it better. :-)

9052,"The politics of Harry Potter are something worth exploring. There's a ministry of magic and it has some sort of legal enforcement powers and its own prisons (that engage in clearly cruel and inhumane punishments that almost certainly violate the ICCPR) and they claim the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at least is clued into the existence of this society. Magic society also has its own currency and banking institutions so they must lend out money and, again, have a currency issuing authority.

There are several problems with this. For one, sovereign states like the United Kingdom aren't super happy about another state existing in their territory and arresting people/trying them/imprisoning and torturing them/having a thriving banking sector that pays zero taxes.  It also means wizards who aren't well-connected to the muggle world may not have official citizenship in any muggle nation and are thus stateless persons."

9054,"Peggy Hill is a shitbag. 

She teaches substitute Spanish, a language she can't even speak properly, and acts like it's the most important thing in the world. 

She thinks she is a genius and is oblivious to her own inflated ego and stupidity. It took her 13 years to realize that Nancy has been cheating on Dale when everyone knew.

Whenever anyone is better at her at anything, she gets insanely jealous and wants them out of the picture, even if it's her own son or husband. She got Hank fired - yes, FIRED - because he was the most popular teacher in school, and she didn't want Hank to win her ""famed"" Substitute Teacher of the Year award. She even had the gall to change her name on the ballot to ""Mrs. Hank Hill"" so that she would have a shot at winning the award.

She broke every bone in her body when she fell out of that plane, but personally I wished she would've died."
9055,"Later learned it was just sleep paralysis but the way it happened was weird as shit and didn't seem to match with usual sleep paralysis. Im still posting because as it happened I was 100% positive I was dead, so its relevant imo. 

 I was laying on my side in bed and my whole body suddenly went limp and I rolled down onto my face. My eyes were open but everything dimmed to pure blackness, and suddenly I could hear a low humming sound with a little bit of static buzzing. 


At first I was like ""what the fuck is happening"" I tried moving and making noise but it was like I was locked inside my head. The next few thoughts I had were ""Well I guess I must be dead, I don't know how but I guess that was it..I never got to be happy, nothing I can do about it now."" I just kind of accepted that was just my whole life right there that had happened and ended. Then I just kinda focused on the blackness in front of me and became curious. ""Where am I going now? There must be an afterlife because I'm still thinking. Lets see whats on the other side""

The feeling of ""here's death"" is extremely erie and hard to really describe. Then i just kind of snapped back and had full control over myself again. 


That was the first time that happened to me, the second time like a few months later it hit me unexpectedly again and it wasn't as positive. Second time around I remember thinking ""Fuck I don't want to go, that can't be it. This can't be how I fucking die."" 


For a few years after that I absolutely hated the feeling of falling asleep and would always jolt myself awake because I still wasn't aware of sleep parslysis was, and that I couldn't die from it. Every episode I had after that was very different, usually very minor like waking up at 3am and not having control over an arm or something even though it wasn't numb. Or I could feel a shadowy person creep up on me and get right next to my face while I couldn't move or open my eyes. 




Tldr; Sleep paralysis is fucking weird. "

9062,"me and a coworker were discussing interviews, and the topic of what you wear to an interview. i was going on and on about wearing a dress shirt and tie to make an impression. my coworker was trying to say it does not matter.

so we asked our manager who does the hiring in our big box retail store (it honestly does have better buys than most spots...) would he hire someone who not only does *not* dress up, but even comes in s t-shirt.

he says he does not judge on clothing. me 
being confused, says why the hell not? 

he says ""you never know what someone is going through at home or they might not be able to afford it.""

my manager being a wise version of a jersey shore bro, blew me away with that thought. it humbled me right away.

with that said, you don't know how the first guy was brought up. maybe he was poor and cherished every meal. maybe he was eating for the first time in a long time that wasn't ramen noodles. either way, i personally think it's unfair to hire or not hire according to how they eat.

A better way to go about it is to be honest with relevant information and avoid sharing irrelevant information.  

Also, it helps to be able to hold an open, honest conversation about whatever it was they went to prison for while also eventually shifting the conversation back to why those things should no longer be a concern. 

One of the most helpful tools I got in prison was from a program that involved mock job interviews where we practiced this very thing.  By the time I got out, I‚Äôd had ‚Äúthe conversation‚Äù at least a hundred times.

Finally we're distracted by the scary rise of fascism, but people don't have the sociological knowledge to see that scarcity and refugees are already a factor in the rise of xenophobia, and climate change is going to make that much worse.

9214,"You are reading this comment because of a metric fuckton of math. 

Edit to break it down a bit. The device you're reading my comment on. Math was needed to calculate every aspect of it. To a very finite degree. 

When I posted the comment initially some math was done and you received a notification that someone posted a reply, more math. 


Then I edited the comment, more math. 

Computers use math so reddit uses math every second to figure out how to display my comment, how to track your karma and how to show you what it wants you to see.

To the reddit server our usernames are just 1's and 0's that use math to translate them into names. 

Math is everything it's nuts. I manage a team, I don't have to sit with them to know what they're doing. I use math and statistics and just run reports to make sure things are good.

Then for whatever fucking reason him and his buddy were dropped off and then I was told to go out and meet him with the other dismount in my Vic. That was it. That was all I was told. So I'm sitting here trying to ask my squad leader important information like ""why just me and him?"" And you know ""where the fuck are these dudes."" Squad leader just tells me to go so me and my buddy get out and our Vic just drives away. So there we are walking down a bazaar. Me with just my M4 with a 203 and my buddy... With a fucking M14. Oh and did I mention neither of us had radios? We are getting stares from everyone. We have no idea what to do. People and kids are coming up to us and we are trying to keep them away and look for these civilian dudes. Finally after what felt like forever we hear the guys yelling at us from a rooftop. Thank God. We make our way up and the dudes finish talking to the elder or whatever and we make our way out. When we are picked up again my squad leader was telling us how the TOC was getting reflections that were saying ""we see the Americans on the roof and are going to kill them"" and stuff like that. I have no idea what was going through my leadership's heads but holy fuck that could have ended so badly. Sorry if I didn't add everything I wasn't trying to make this drag out.

2. Spending time with my brother. He's an asshole so now I don't talk to him at all. When he got to high school he became wildly narcissistic and cruel towards me to the point that I don't really care about him any more.

9410,"Male therapist here, and about 10 years experience. I just had to recently fire a client. I'm the type of person who's open to have a conversation about anything really. I'm also sober, which is important to this story. 

So, had a client, last minute booking she just needed work done, no problem. Get in the treatment room and I find out she's recently started AA meetings (I never liked them but I'm a ""whatever keeps you sober"" kind of person). We bond a bit over that, and over the next several sessions she talks about her husband, and the various other men in her life that are...well it's a weird situation. She's allowed to have boyfriends, but not physically. Anyway, long story short I help give her advice on stuff, she talks endlessly about all the guys that she strings along for attention. Fine, whatever. Then. She starts making some comments that I thought were a little odd, like ""I know you're happier to see me than your other clients, or you're just really good at your job,"" she asks me ""are there people who come in who have AMAZING bodies and it distracts you?"" which ties into an earlier comment she'd made about how when other guys see her in a bikini they go crazy. I'm in work mode, so attractiveness just doesn't make it through the filter and I just smile and nod. 

Then. One session she comes in and again starts talking about her boyfriend that she's in love with, and about how she has 8 guys ""in her life"" and decides she's going to read me a text she sent to a friend. It sounds like some voice-over narration from Sex and the City and I'm just praying I'm not on the list, but sure enough I'm the last entry. And I quote ""...is my massage therapist, and at some point I harbored hopes that he'd invite me into his marriage as a unicorn, but I don't really do girls. For now I'm happy to just pay to have him rub me for 50 minutes and let the sexual tension between us hang in the air.""  

Now, I've had a guy grab my ass and ask if I wanted to make extra money before and that was a really easy situation to just nope the fuck out of. In hindsight, so was this one, as it's pretty clear what her intentions with our sessions really were but in the moment, I deer-in-the-headlighted. All I saw was: male therapist, female client, the words ""sexual tension"" and career ending catastrophe. It got really awkward and I just changed the subject. At the end of the session I reminded her ""you know that our relationship here is purely professional right?"" which she seemed surprised by. Luckily, my boss was pretty chill when I filled her in on the situation and asked that I not work with her anymore. Thankfully, nothing came of it, and the client stopped coming to the clinic.

Also, had a woman who came in, made weird grunting noises, shifted her hips a lot, and didn't say a word while she was on the table. I asked her frequently if the pressure was too much, if she was ok, but she just kept saying she was fine. I could see her hands, so I don't know what the fuck was going on. She left, I felt fuckin' weird, never saw her again. 

TL;DR - yes. sort of. "

I once rented a room in an apartment from a guy I know know was a complete scumbag. He seemed legit enough and I was in a pinch so I rented the room. After maybe 6 months in late fall he tells me about the crawl space in the attic. He informs me that he allows a homeless man sleep up there in the winter for a little bit of money. A real humanitarian you might think but unfortunately that was not the case. One day as I‚Äôm coming home from work his landlord, who I never met asks if *john (not his actual name) was home. I told him I didn‚Äôt think so. I introduced myself and told I‚Äôm living upstairs. He had no idea that John was renting a room and proceeded to inform me that John was getting evicted for not paying rent. I had been giving fuck money every month and he was going straight to the horse track with it.   
I also came to find out he was selling prescription drugs on Craig‚Äôs list. Not the brightest drug dealer out there but hey mans gotta eat. I confronted him but he was pretty irrational and I decided I should just cut my losses and gtfo. He lets me know he was throwing an ‚Äúeviction party‚Äù yayyy! I put all my shit in my room, pad locked it, and went to my buddy‚Äôs for the weekend. When I got home on Sunday our front door was broken in, my door was broken in, and the place was trashed. Apparently the eviction party never happened. Why? Because the local police executed a search warrant before it started and hulled his ass to jail for FUCKING SELLING DRUGS ON CRAIGS LIST JOHN YOU FUCKING IDIOT! Apparently he got a good amount of time too because he was on probation for a statutory rape charge he got when he was 18 with a 16 year old...I apparently don‚Äôt have a good instinct for people.

When I got clean from heroin I had exactly zero long-term health problems from its use.  Meth makes you batshit crazy and I can spot a tweeker from a mile away.   I mean, one comes from a plant and the other is made with batteries and drain cleaner so that's probably a pretty good indication is which is worse for your health.

Diogenes was known for an incredibly anti-establishment lifestyle. He was content living in a barrel, begging for food, and acting like an animal. He flew in the face of social convention, often mocking the elite, defacing currency, and airing his distaste for Greek society in general. There are even stories of him doing brutish things, like pissing on a crowd who was mocking him.

Apparently Alexander met Diogenes, and asked him what he wanted from him. Diogenes basically told him his wish was Alexander step aside, he was blocking Diogenes' sunlight.

Alexander developed a respect for his boldness, and is reportedly to have said that if he didn't live life as Alexander, he would have liked to have lived as Diogenes."

When the other teachers heard she was coming back for a second year at the school, all but two of them found jobs at other schools. Which is very impressive considering we had about 40 teachers in the school.

On the last day of school, which was a 'sluff' day, we asked one of the teachers if we could hang out in his classroom instead of going to the class we were supposed to be in. He said no. We told him it wasn't a big deal since no one cared where we were. He said ""I'm already going to be in enough trouble this afternoon. I'm going to tell the principal exactly what I think of her."" He got a job in a different district after that."

-people can sense you doing nice things solely for reward and it's shitty, see also, nice guy(tm)

-women are ""people like me except they have boobs"" (this is surprisingly a new discovery for a disturbing number of people)

Traditionally men were not HPV vaccinated because there was no link to cancer in men. HPV will cause cervical cancer in women but they can be vaccinated. Even vaccinated though they can still be carriers. Little boys weren't vaccinated because men didn't get any testicular or prostate cancer from HPV. But the link to mouth nose and throat cancer was not understood until recently. If you are an adult it's too late because the window for vaccination is very young.

Waited another full day. No call. Called again. Same response. Waited 2 days. Same situation. I probably called 5 times over about 10 days or so because I really wanted the job and figured we would be a good fit for each other. 

Never did hear from the manager. So I went to the location to speak with him directly. Got some BS answer about him not being there. Waited a bit and saw him walking around just dicking off. I guess they weren't expecting me to know who the manager was. So I asked again. Same answer. At that point I just decided I didn't want to work for someone who cares that little about people and their time.

9637,"Ultimately, it's better to reduce the number of HIV infections overall, even if some people don't get punished as much as they might have. The number of people going around maliciously infecting others with HIV is much, much lower than the number of people accidentally infecting each other, and it's not even clear that threat of a felony did much to deter those individuals.

Today, HIV is no longer the death sentence it used to be. It's hard to argue that it still deserves the extra punishment compared with other diseases, if it ever deserved them at all.

You have to understand that the old law, and similar laws in other states, were written at the height of AIDS hysteria. The disease was poorly understood, and carried an enormous amount of negative stigma. Rather than stemming new HIV infections, all the law ended up doing is stigmatizing carriers of the disease, malicious or otherwise.

And regardless of whether you agree with the lawmakers' rationale, you really ought to take the effort to learn the reasons, rather than just assuming ""straight stupidity""."

What made it more awkward was that this guy had a WIFE who was sitting right next to him with the most fixed expression on her face.

9788,"Hear me out here. I'm not OP, so they may be a little more extreme. I'm not Hitler either, I don't believe anyone should be killed for Eugenics, just left behind.

From a purely pragmatic viewpoint, people who are *born* seriously mentally or physically disabled are a detriment to the race as a whole, consuming medical resources and putting a mental strain on those around them that have to deal with the consequences. You see it in the [serious] threads of parents who have children who will never be able to live on their own. Things like Type 1 diabetes are of a lesser importance in my viewpoint as they can still remain self-sufficient. The same applies to high functioning spectrum but I draw the line at, excuse my crudeness, ""retards"" like Downs.

Outside of the past 100 years or so, children with downs or autism would not generally survive. They're not useful, so they didn't live to reproduce. If someone was born with a cleft lip or no fingers or the inability to learn to walk, they would be discarded. Now, they may continue to live just because the greater whole takes pity on their condition and we have the resources to spare. Parents love their kids, I totally understand, but again from a purely pragmatic viewpoint there is no reason to support the disabled so that they may reproduce. 

For this reason, my prejudice (and I do recognize it is a prejudice) does not extend to those who have *become* disabled. If they lost brain function in a car accident or their legs while skiing, they can stay. There is nothing genetically wrong with them. You can't pass on a spinal injury, but you can pass on Spina Bifida.

TL:DR  
I don't like the 21st century mentality that everyone is going to live and do well. If we can detect it, abort. If not, sucks for the baby. I think, long term, normalizing spectrum disorders and other genetic defects will have an Idiocracy or Wall-E -like effect on the race. Eugenics is not evil, it's pragmatic.

He yelled at me for not doing a task fast enough, and I yelled back. In that moment, he stopped being this huge, unshakable monolith to just a guy.

We need to pay teachers more as a whole and enable them to achieve advanced degrees. We need innovative solutions to deal with a global economy and workforce that has no idea what is coming next.

With therapy, I tell the therapist my problem, and then... I sit in a room with them for an hour every week.

Is it too much to expect for my therapist to explain how this is supposed to work? How is this process supposed to work? What should my goals for each session be?

I explicitly asked my therapist at the end of each session if he had anything he wanted me to do in my life before the next session. He -always- said no.

If there is more value to therapy beyond the catharsis of having someone who will listen to your bitching for an hour every week, I don't know what it is. (And in my case, catharsis wasn't very valuable to me.)"

 The most fucked up profile I read was u/worthless319 ... not for the faint-hearted. Basically, it's a guy that went crazy off of DMT and other psychedelics. He thought there was going to be an apocalypse or something and that god told him that he has to chop his dick off. So this dude chops his dick off, cooks it eats it. He shoots it a couple of times I think. He even posted pics so you know it's him. He goes cross country to meet a guy that would kill him because it's what he wanted. Dude never posted since.

 My second scariest thing I read on Reddit was on r/sadboys about someone that owed $700,000 to the mob. He asked how to make money. He later then posted a pic of multiple cars stalking him, people getting out and possibly making their way over to kill him. It was at night too and he was in a parking lot. He never posted after that pic...

 Here's the thread for the r/sadboys dude:

 Here are the pics for the stalkers:  http://imgur.com/7ZdzN6w


 Another thing was the ask a rapist thread which was about a dude that wanted to ask the rapists about their point of view. There were a couple of creeps acting as girls and asking how to stop themselves from getting raped... possibly to stop the girls from fighting them off. The thread got locked, deleted and psychologist said that reading the comments was the same thing as experiencing/committing the act of rape.


 One thing I found jokes in the history of reddit was a guy who said that if a comment got 400 gold, he would eat a 
 bulldick and he did:

 Theres one redditor named u/SpontaneousH who tried heroin 7-8 years ago for shits and giggles. Sadly, this poor 
 guy got addicted and it took years for him to recover. I think he also said he lost his family.

 One story that was also sad was the guy who was wearing noise-cancelling earphones in his house. While he was gaming with them on, a rapist came in his house and was raping his wife for 10 minutes and threatened his wife 3 times that he would rape his daughter. He finally hears her cries so he gets a gun and kills him. He then scoops up his baby, goes out the front door and sees his scared neighbor. The neighbor then asks for the kid and gun, then the cops arrive and all charges against him for killing the rapist is dropped. What's also sad was that the rapist stabbed her in the arm or shoulder twice and it was really deep wounds I think. so it was really hard for her to stop it from happening. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/39suml/seriousredditors_who_have_had_to_kill_in_self/

Futuristic movies often portray these holographic interfaces where you slide objects around in 3D space with big sweeping hand gestures. Can you imagine doing that all day? None of that is practical, it just looks cool for a movie.

.

Voice control will never become the primary interface of a computer system, you can usually interact with the computer faster than you can verbalize it. Also, would you really want to say every single thing you're doing to your computer?

""Computer, open up my three favorite porn sites and alternate between them every 30 seconds"" - ""specify pornography preferences"" - ""uhh, latex bondage, furry, and oral""

I also don't want to come to work every day and announce ""computer - open up Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and switch to my company email if my boss comes around""

.

Perhaps mind control would replace a physical implement, if there was some way to control the machine with thought.

But how would that really work? Would you just be verbalizing the same thing in your mind? That would run into similar problems as voice control. I guess you can think faster than you can talk though.

Whatever the case, mouse and keyboard isn't going away in the foreseeable future."

 I went to the hospital at 19 after getting hit by an SUV on my bike. Saw multiple doctors, had a few x rays. Didn't cost me a penny. 

Had a baby a year and a half ago. Was medicated. Stayed overnight and most of the next day in hospital. Took my kid multiple times to the hospital/dr's since then. Paid for none of it. At only 24, the amount I've paid in taxes is *nothing* compared to what I would have had to pay for health care my self. I'm not afraid of going into debt if I get sick or injured just to pay for the medical care I need to live. 

So your argument against this is that you want to go into crazy debt when (probably not if, everyone needs health care at some point) you get sick or injured, rather than pay a bit more in taxes so you don't have to worry about paying crazy amounts. Because you don't want to pay for other people too? You want to pay just for yourself even if it means paying more than you would have through taxes..?"

During a particularly bad episode, a close friend took me to a local ER - a smaller hospital than I usually went to for neurology. I called the nurse after having another seizure in my room, I didn‚Äôt have convulsions - I had partial seizures meaning I didn‚Äôt shake and I could sometimes speak during them. She told me I wasn‚Äôt seizing, because I wasn‚Äôt having convulsions. I told her I don‚Äôt have convulsions and she told me that I don‚Äôt have epilepsy. I discharged myself and went to another hospital. 

TLDR; had a nurse tell me I didn‚Äôt really have a seizure disorder because I didn‚Äôt have convulsions. "
10140,See I'm a nurse and I don't think she meant to be rude everything is fast paced and quick in the ER and ER nurses are usually A1 type personality like they're bold and crazy. I think she was rude in a socially awkward way of thinking out loud without thinking but didn't mean to be

10144,"Oh, Michael Jackson was definitely murdered, but not by EA. He was murdered by Sony.

Michael owned ATV, so he did owned a lot of really valuable songs, including songs from the Beatles. At some point, Michael agrees to co-own it along with Sony, 50/50. A couple of years go by and Sony is trying to get full ownership of ATV. To do this, they must get MJ to sell them the other half of it, but Michael wouldn't do it, no matter what happened to him (financially speaking) he always said he wouldn't sell his part.

Sony then starts trying to make MJ struggle financially by spreading all these rumors, making him look bad in the process in an attempt to get him to give full custody of ATV to them, but Michael won't break.

Things start getting really tense between them, you can see several speaches MJ gave to his fans about Sony, and how evil they were. Michael also started telling people close to him that he would be murdered for his catalogue. So he was.

I can't know for sure this, obviously. I can't really know if Michael molested little kids or not, but my heart and gut tells me MJ's side of the story is the real one. It makes perfect sense."
10145,"I think it's more that people generally don't document everything well, they're afraid that they'll lose, don't want to spend the time, and they don't know exactly how to approach it."
10146,"When I was in elementary school, I had some problems with aggressive behavior. If I thought someone wasn‚Äôt listening to what I was saying I would get physical, but even for little reasons (as in a kid is hitting a tree with a branch, I get angry because he‚Äôs hurting the tree, he says he can do what he wants, I shove him to the ground). 
I never liked being like that, I just couldn‚Äôt stop myself and very quickly other children starting bugging me. Problem was, teachers never believed that they were provoking me or that I hated how angry I got. They just thought I was a bully who was being raised poorly (never mind that my older brother and sister were super sweet). 
Now the thing that still makes me angry to this day: the school never told my parents. Not for one moment did they think: ‚Äúwe should tell her parents that she‚Äôs punching, pushing and occasionally biting other children‚Äù. 
My parents had to find out through other parents because I was never invited for birthday parties. 
I changed a lot on my own (without any help from a therapist even though I definitely should have had help), but it didn‚Äôt matter for anyone at that school, they still provoked me and teachers still called me a bully.
I decide I want to change schools and suddenly the principal is all like: ‚ÄúWe we‚Äôre going to start an anti-bullying campaign! Then we could help your daughter!‚Äù My parents never bothered to ask in what way. 
At my new school, I never once was called a bully. I couldn‚Äôt contain my anger only one time and got physical, but I started BAWLING and kept saying to the teacher at the new school that I‚Äôve improved so much and I‚Äôm not that person anymore. At fucking 11 years old. 

EDIT: relevant information: I might have had a developmental/neurological issue. I had a lot of problems with sarcasm and metaphors and even lying. I just couldn't understand them. A therapist told me that it might be possible that this also meant I couldn't articulate my feelings in a verbal way for a long time.
Secondly, I used to sort of ""black out"". A lot of the stories I know have been told to me by my parents or other people. The kid hitting the tree? I don't actually remember him. Sometimes it felt like complete depersonalization in my head. I could only stop myself because I learned to break through that. That's why it sounds like ""I'm excusing myself"". Because it always felt like I wasn't in control of myself. I can't explain it. I never wanted to feel better than someone else. Or to actually hurt someone else. I wanted to make myself understood. In the worst way possible.

EDIT2: To be absolutely clear: I don‚Äôt think my behavior was good. I hurt people. I think a guy still has a tiny scar because of me (or at least so he said when we were both still 13). I do not condone that behavior. I just wanted to shed some light on a situation where they absolutely should‚Äôve talked with my parents and with me, ‚Äúthe bully‚Äù. They would‚Äôve realized it didn‚Äôt have a desire to hurt people. I would‚Äôve gotten professional help with my anger issues and communication issues and other kids would not have gotten hurt. Years later, a lot of them were in my high school and we got along super well. Even they didn‚Äôt call me a bully when we talked about ‚Äúthose days‚Äù (or at least not to my face)
So yeah, to close off this way too long post, teachers, talk to the bullies. They might have a shitty home situation or mental problems. Or they might just be immense dicks. But then you know for sure they are dicks. "

10159,"Second thing would be making pregnancy totally voluntary, at least for humans. Both parties need to want it for it to happen, so no unwanted pregnancies and overpopulation most likely will not happen. If that's not enough to cure overpopulation (I suspect it is) just tweak the odds on getting pregnant a bit.

Though of course that will lead to a much older population very soon, as people in their 60s, 70s etc are suddenly going to have much longer average lifespans with no diseases and we will suddenly have far fewer children.

10170,"We didn't adopt an older kid we fostered one for a few years while the parents got their shit together. The kids lived in a trailer without power, parents or food. The parents were off getting drunk and high. The girl went to another member of family we got the boy. We had several hurdles but we were able to conquer them all with patience and time. The first was food the boy was skinny as a rail and ate everything in our house. We had groceries that lasted the wife and I normally 2 weeks to a month only lasted days for the first 6 months. An example we shop for bulk items at Sam's club we bought IIRC 5lbs of pretzel sticks those lasted me 6-8 months the boy had them gone in 4 days. Once he realized there would always be food available he slowed down and groceries lasted in the house.

The 2nd largest hurdle was structure my wife and I fought with enforcing a bedtime, do homework and bringing his grades up. Before coming to us he did what he wanted stayed up as late as he wanted it was a full 180 at our house. And chores we all shared responsibility with keeping the house clean and the yard.

Now he is grown and a single father of a little girl and he is raising her properly he told us she wont grow up the way he did. My wife and I silently pat ourselves on the back as his mother tries to take credit for what he has become but the family knows who is responsible. He works hard to make his daughter happy and to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads."

Also, just to help others, when you go to the Dr ask them to not write a script for ""Epipen"" that is a brand and it is a super expensive one. Ask them to write for ""Epinephrine Auto Injector"". That is the generic name and will allow the pharmacy to fill it with ANY injector. Then go to CVS and ask them for the $50 off coupon for ""Adrenaclick"" (http://adrenaclick.com/) and do NOT use your insurance. Without insurance, it cost $110 for a 2 pack at CVS and with the $50 off coupon, it comes to $60 for a 2 pack. Insurance usually has a $100 or more co-pay. (yeah, stupid, I know)

Me and my girl rented a few movies from Blockbuster and one of them had a trailer for Son of the Mask.

We nearly jumped out of our skins. It took us a moment to figure out what had happened. I then noticed that my fish bowl was shattered and there was water everywhere. My goldfish Buster couldn't handle the trailer for Son of the Mask at all and had blown his brains out with his .357 Magnum. You see goldfish are smaller than us and have a much smaller nervous system, he couldn't handle the trailer for Son of the Mask and decided to take the only way out that was available to him.

My girl and I broke up shortly after. I had been close to proposing to her, I really thought she was the one, however our relationship had become cold and distant after Buster's death. We soon realized he was really the glue that held the relationship together. 

She really loved that fish and while she would never come out and say it, I knew she held me responsible for Buster's death, as I was the one who rented the movie that had the trailer for Son of the Mask on it, also I had purchased Buster his .357 Magnum as a gift because he was into firearms and his favorite movie was Dirty Harry.

Don't watch the trailer for Son of the Mask is all I can say. Especially if you have any dear goldfish that you care for. I'm sorry Buster you were a good fish, you deserved better.  :-("

About 2 hours after he went to bed, I was playing computer games and just glancing at the video baby monitor the parents had set up. Of course, it was somewhat flickery and the image wasn't perfect, but it was helpful to make sure I knew he was ok. On this particular night, the camera glitched horribly and was very fuzzy for a minute or two. When it cleared up, the kid was gone. I, freaking out internally but still wanting to make sure he was ok, made my way across the hall to his room. The door was open a crack, leading to a dark and empty room. No kid to be seen. So I nudge the door open and walk in, heart pounding. When something grabbed my leg I pretty much died of fright. The little guy had gotten out of his crib and made it to the door, but got stuck holding himself up in the doorknob. When I walked past, he latched onto my leg.

We get bored easily and that extends to people.  For a second, think of any one of the innumerable things you swore you ""had to have"". That dress? That car? The new gaming console? That cute waitress?

Same shit. You start off protecting it from rain, dust, pain, etc. You treat it like the thing you really wanted because you really did...and then you get used to it. Suddenly it can get a bit dusty without you caring. Soon you aren't washing that car for weeks at a time. Shit, soon that dress doesn't even fit because you outgrew it. Soon that gaming console makes a loud noise when it's on for too long and the new one is all the rage anyway.

People are the same with other people. You just have to realize that a person isn't an object and you have to work at caring. Kids usually force that hand but not always.

Just realize from now on that you'll grow some level of bored with whoever you meet. Nobody is that special. Your grandparents that have been married 50 years had to work at it and kinda loathe each other üòÖ"
10339,WISDOM TEETH IN YOUR TEMPLE?! That's terrifying. 
10340,"Oh boy, where to begin. In essence, people misunderstand what Miranda Rights are actually supposed to be used for. They only apply if the police are asking you a very specific type of question: interrogative questions, a.k.a. questions that are specifically being asked in order to help prove your guilt (or innocence) in a crime. Basic things like asking for your name, someone to call, what part of town you live in, etc., are not these questions, and are often necessary if you're being booked in jail for anything, even something very small. If you refuse to tell the officer putting you in a cell your name, it's not likely to make them very sympathetic. If you refuse to tell them where you were two hours ago, that's fair enough.

People also often don't understand the scope of Miranda Rights and how to properly use them. If officers don't read you your Miranda Rights and then start interrogating you, it's true that anything you say is inadmissible in court. *However*, should something you say indirectly lead them to another piece of evidence that they did not obtain through direct questioning, that evidence *is* admissible in court. Also, waiving your Miranda Rights vs. invoking them. You are allowed at any point during questioning, after answering however many questions, to invoke your Miranda Rights. Sometimes you might get a cop saying to you, ""well listen, you've already answered all these questions, you can't just suddenly decide to hush up."" This is patently untrue. You can invoke your right to remain silent at any point. Again though, there's a caveat. If you invoke your Miranda Rights to remain silent and then you suddenly start answering questions again, your prior invocation of your Miranda Rights *does not* mean this evidence is inadmissible in court. Once you've been read your Miranda Rights, *anything you tell the police* may be used against you in a court of law. All you can do at that point if you don't want them to have anything on you is sit back, be quiet, and wait for a lawyer.

Good grief that was long. Hope you find it interesting!"

10348,"Well that's why the invented the death camps and such. At the start of their cleansing of Eastern European Jewry they had groups of SS (sometimes augmented by Police and Army units) of execution squads going around behind the frontlines and basically liquidate entire towns and cities of their Jewish population - the usual method being rounding up all the Jews and forcing them in to some open field somewhere, dig deep ditches, and then open fire. Rinse and repeat. That was how the Einsatzgruppen operated, especially after the June 1941 Nazi invasion of the USSR. These firing squads went all over and shot their victims by the hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, and in some cases hundreds of thousands (like Babi Yar outside of Kiev). This actually proved to be inefficient, costly (expending bullets and manpower to fire those bullets at unarmed civilians instead of at the frontline firing them at Soviet soldiers), and mentally draining on the executioners. So that's when death camps became a major thing. The Nazis needed a more sterilized, efficient, mechanical, and less mentally taxing way of killing their victims. So yes, it is a stereotype but truth of the Germans being efficient that played out in such a horribly horrific and tragic way.

Ironically most of the Holocaust deniers are Neo-Nazis, yet the Nazis themselves kept great records of their own atrocities (for functionality and efficiency purposes). So the deniers are supporting some aspects of their horrible ideology, but not the reality of it? Stupid in my opinion (on many, so many counts). "

Men with long hair should use conditioner so it doesn't look knotted and dry and you can get some kind of texturizing spray to give it more body and definition. That's all stuff you can get at the drugstore.

For clothes, I think everyone should have at least one casual pair of Vans/Converse/Clarks in a neutral color, not some crazy pattern or color for your main pair of shoes. I've also noticed that if you're a jeans and a t-shirt kind of guy, just getting a denim jacket or a flannel/canvas shirt to wear over the t-shirt looks nice.

Some little details that make an outfit look more put together are rolling up the sleeves on a long-sleeve shirt or cuffing your jeans to show off funky socks or ankle-height shoes like high-tops or desert boots.

I remember, while being at a party, him leaving at 2 am with a group of friends, heading towards a more exclusive location ; an event reserved for few. After a night laden with abject  pleasures and the kind on excitement only a location filled with gorgeous 20 something, they left around 6 a.m. On the way back, my friend begged the driver, still in the grip of the last hours frenzy, to slow down, as he was driving like a fool. Following several ignored requests, my friend started screaming that he wanted to get out of the car, as he was scared and he felt something bad was going to happen . They dropped him off, raised the volume of the speakers and started devouring the asfalt again.

The following day, my friend was woken in the early afternoon up by the police knocking at his door. His friends had fallen off a cliff and crushed 60 meters below, on the rock hard asphalt. Not only the police had trouble identifying the bodies ; they couldn't even identify what crushed and burnt piece of body belonged to whom. "

His name was somewhat common so I wasnt sure it was him, but when I saw the mugshot, I was sure it was the same guy. 

I asked him about it and he said it wasnt at all what it seemed. I couldn't resist hearing his side so I went on the date anyway.... he turned out to be a complete scumbag who wore butt plugs. (Nothing against buttplugs but he brought it up on date #1 and tried to get me to be a part of it. No thanks.)

10474,"Similarly, I had a dream about a guy I went to high school with. We were never exactly close but we lived parallel lives and knew each other well. His sudden, horrific death shook me into a depression that lasted two months, at least.

6 months later. I have a dream about him where everything felt insanely real. Like if I was slapped in the dream, it would hurt. It took place in our church gym, where we had spent a lot of time together as kids, and where he had also spent a lot of time with his wife and children. 

There used to be a curtain in the gym that separated it in half, the half used for dinner and the half used for the youth room when we outgrew our actual room. In my dream, it acted as the veil of death. I existed somewhere in between.

He came up and talked to me. I don‚Äôt remember his exact words but I do remember the gist that he was okay, he was doing what he was meant to be doing, and that he wanted me to tell his wife. She was in the dream too and I asked why he didn‚Äôt just tell her himself, to which he replied ‚ÄúI want to, but she wouldn‚Äôt believe it was really me.‚Äù

I woke up with a serious sense of urgency and debated a few days about telling her this. It was still a somewhat fresh wound for her (and likely always will be), and if she didn‚Äôt believe me, it could come across as unimaginably cruel and painful for her. But, knowing what I do about both her and her extreme faith, I took a gamble and preemptively apologized and told her I know I sound crazy but I would never do this to her if I didn‚Äôt truly believe it. I told her the dream, word for word as I remembered.

She was so excited. It was like I had brought him back to say hi. She told me that they had both been big believers in the idea that dreams can carry messages from the spiritual world and she had wondered often why he hadn‚Äôt contacted her in this way. She said what I told her about my dream followed exactly what she had been praying to know (that he was okay, happy and if he still cared for her) and explained why he hadn‚Äôt sent her a message, because he knew her well enough to know she would never know for sure if it was him or her own desires unless it came from someone else. She truly believed my dream was a message for her. 

I don‚Äôt know what the truth is and I probably won‚Äôt until I die. But I know that sharing it with her helped her heal a little bit, and I hope that dream is what she thinks it is, if only because if it was, I got to help a new father tell his wife and family that he loved them one last time, and maybe that can be their last memory of him, not his being crushed to death in a mangled car by a rogue criminal so badly that they couldn‚Äôt even find all the pieces of his body.

However, you only had a couple of seconds to walk through before the door closes again. No automatic sensors. Needless to say, i somehow managed to get banged by it in the doorway and smash all those plates on the floor. The WHOLE restaurant (about 40-50 people) went completely silent.

I just knew that I liked to learn and think and write, and was offered a full fellowship with a living wage stipend). All of our professors and advisors expected us to turn around and go right into academia. They didn't have a solution for the fact that there are literally about 3 tenure-track jobs for every 1,000 people who graduate in our field every year. The rest are part-time and adjunct positions with no benefits or guarantee of continued employment, often in universities and towns we'd never even heard of. So when I told my professors I wasn't planning on staying in academia, but still needed guidance as to how to navigate my professional career, they all shrugged and told me they didn't have any knowledge about careers outside of academia. No support, no advice. I ended up ""overqualified"" or simply irrelevantly qualified for every job I applied to.

An experience you hear reported by a lot of ex-incels after having sex with an attractive escort is that ""it's not a big deal."" They had pumped themselves up and gotten so angry over what is essentially 20 minutes of physical pleasure comparable to a good meal or bath. It's not mind blowing. It actually feels kind of stupid how ""just ok"" sex is compared to how it is portrayed and how a hormonal teenager might feel about it. No matter how attractive someone is after an hour of sex you'll be like ok no more.

But they need to have that experience enough until they completely normalize that sex isn't a big deal, attractive women are just people, and we should focus on ourselves because happiness comes from within."

His main income came from feeding the local CCGers habit and holding ygo tournaments.

Best all around boardgame: Gloomhaven. However, some say this blurs the line between boardgame and just game. Create a party of unique characters and abilities and play through a dynamic world with over 90 scenarios. Can play up to 6 to start, but there is a very substantial learning curve. 

Most replayable: Betrayal at House on the Hill. Also up to six players, explore a creepy house, adding rooms and experiencing unsettling events as you go. At some point a player will trigger a Haunt, causing one (or more) of the players to become traitor. Comes with unique and random 50 scenarios, with an expansion that adds 50 more.

Best family game: Azul. Players place tiles on their mat to score points, which sounds lame but is actually very strategic and a lot of fun. Plus, the tiles look like beautiful mosaic Starbursts.

Best party game: Codenames. Two teams try to guess a number of words from a grid without guessing any of the other teams words. Basically like strategic Password, but gets very exciting and silly. There are many variations, like pictures, Disney and an adult version.

Best cooperative game: Pandemic. This is a very popular game where a group of players try to work together to eradicate the world of ever increasing diseases. Different characters in the game provide different abilities, which dramatically change the way you play the game, which can be very hard to beat sometimes. Also comes with a large number of expansions, including some very cool Legacy editions.

Best game for two players: 7 Wonders Duel. Its fast, it's fun, and it provides several paths to victory, so keep an eye on your opponent.  Based on the also awesome game, 7 Wonders. Honorable mention: Mr Jack, Raptor.

Other fun games that I love: Evolution (use cards to create species to help you survive against predators and gain food), Galaxy Trucker (build a ship that will be able to travel the galaxy and pick up cargo for cash), Smallworld (compete with other players to control a tiny map) and Scythe (control territory, gain resources and complete objectives in an alternate timeline 1912 mechanized Europe).

We constantly had to deal with one employee's mom calling pretty often. Once, her daughter turned in a time-off request a few days before she needed a week off for a family vacation they had bought tickets for. The mom was livid at me over the phone and I politely said that her daughter was simply the last to request the time off and that was the policy unless it was an emergency. She yelled at me and said that her daughter had known about it for months. I mentioned that if she wanted to try and trade shifts with people, that was her only option. She was furious. 

The mom had also called to ""check in"" on her daughter's application during the hiring process and also to discuss her employee housing. 

We told the daughter she needed to fight her own battles and if we had to deal with her mom ever again she wouldn't be inclined to be hired the following summer. "

She responded with, ""Oh no honey, 8 is like childbirth, you're probably at a 3."" And then she marked a 3 on my chart.

If that wasn't enough, when it was confirmed that it was indeed a miscarriage and I had been about 5 weeks along I couldn't stop crying because I had just lost my child.

10941,"I hope Wal-Mart get fucked destroyed, they are the absolute scummiest low life people I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. 

I sprained my knee on the clock on the camera lifting a box the exact way it should have been lifted. It took 1 week for Wal-Mart to ***allow*** me to go to the doctor even though I could no longer walk. Never once did a manager or supervisor ever ask if I was even okay, they only asked ""How did it happen"" not what happened, but ""how"" as in ""How is this, not our fault so we are not liable."" I was told if I went to my own doctor I would be ineligible for workman's comp or any coverage through work and everything would be out of pocket. I had to sit in the manager's office for over an hour while the debated who would take me to the hospital because apparently, I could not have my wife drive me. Once at the hospital I was given a single knee x-ray, an urgent care doctor told me it was sprained and gave me a knee brace. People are ODing left and right on prescription pills and I am rocking a 9 out 10 on the pain scale and unable to walk and I can't get any fucking super aspirin?! Despite asking on several occasions I was never afforded any follow-up appointments, then 1 year from the accident they sent me a form telling me since I had not saught any more treatment that my workman's comp claim was finished and I was on my own. 

The entire first two weeks when I couldn't walk I was unable to miss any work without being fired because they had put me on a D-Day (3 writes up gets you a D-Day meaning any infraction means your ass is gone). Let's explain how I got on a D-Day in the first place. 

1) - First write up. My mom and her boyfriend were moving and I was getting kicked out so I had to move in with friends in my old hometown a few hours away, luckily Wal-Mart is a fucking metastasized cancer and is everywhere so I was able to transfer on December 2nd.On Black Friday, after pulling 4 12 hour shifts and finally a 15-hour shift on Black Friday. My Supervisor pulled me into the office on my last day at that store and explained his displeasure in my leaving and after I told him I didn't have a choice he said 

Him - ""Okay, well you violated your 5th hour for lunch on Black Friday so I am going to have to write you up for that.""

Me- ""But everyone violates we are not allowed the leave the floor, how bad was my violation?""

Him - ""Yep, so you are getting written up for your's, you were 1 minute over on your second lunch break for the day""

1 

fucking

minute.

2) I move down south and in with some friends and start working at a new store. I have been at this store for a few months and make friends with my supervisor. He begs me to go out drinking with him so I do. By the end of the night, I am fucking sick, savagely sick. I spend the whole night sweating profusely, throwing up and shitting. I got some kind of stomach flu and due to that and my new friend dehydration I started to overheat and ended up getting heat stroke and being hospitalized and on IVs. My same supervisor who crashed at my place, who say my wife help me out to the car to take me to the ER, wrote me up for missing work while in the ER.

At this point, Wal-Mart decided that the best thing to do was to lie to me about a job and promote me to Department Manager of Frozen Dairy, the only spot that no one willing takes apparently. Anyways, my poor little car is costing me a fortune in gas and maintenance and I ask my store manager if I could try to transfer to the new Wal-Mart grocery store that is literally opening 3 blocks away from my house because literally cannot afford the cost of travel to and from work and because I knew my car was in trouble and I was trying to save to get it looked at. Boss/Dick man said sure, then once I secured the job at the new location did this..

-Intermission- I posted my own comment about the sad and stupid death of my car as it owns comment so I won't cover up all of it but here is an extra side of Wal-Mart brand Equate ‚Ñ¢ fuckery.

3) A very close family friend died and I wasn't handling it well. Wal-Mart thought that work was best for me and when I asked for the remainder of the day off after finding out about her passing and being denied I was distraught. I accidentally missed a single mother fucking yogurt price change as was written up by the store manager for the 3rd and final time. 

-Intermission Part II- for those not born in the fires and bullshitery that is Wal-Mart, once you hit D-Day you are unable to transfer. I lost my transfer and 3 weeks later my car committed seppuku. 

TL;DR Wal-Mart deserves to be thrown into a pit of rusty hypodermic needles filled with Satan's own syphilitic semen."

I don't remember the details, but in short, a record label executive or some person who worked in this field listened to their stuff and basically told them ""you're pretty cool, your sound is great, etc, but no one needs this kind of stuff anymore"".

I was talking more about the semi-independent small label kind of bands in my initial comment, but yeah, today's notion seems to be that ""rap has become the new rock"". 

&gt;The other side to that is I think rock artists now are afraid to be honest and take real risks. They favor irony or tongue-in-cheekedness over having balls.

Can't agree here though. It seems to me that personal and intimate topics like mental health and drug abuse are very prevalent in popular art nowadays. But hell, I don't even really know what's actually ""popular"" now and I'm musically stuck in the previous century, so don't take my word for it.

Wanted to comment on the record industry as well, but (especially as a musician myself) I have quite a bit of (sometimes self-contradicting) views regarding the whole thing, so if I had started, it would  have quickly turned into an essay-length ramble, so I digress :)"

10995,"Here's the blunt answer: **Just get out.** It's going to hurt, and you're going to hurt a lot. You're going to want to get back together. But just fucking don't. Don't put yourself through more of that, cause good relationships are steady and full of trust and listening. From what I know, that's not what you're in currently. 

My breaking point was when she tried bringing drugs around me constantly. I'm a former addict and have always had problems with drugs, whether it turns into a bad habit or I go crazy because of them. That's not a good mix for a relationship with someone who likes drugs. 

Explanation of the situation: Our whole problem was she was smoking entirely too much weed/doing other drugs too much and it was affecting every aspect of her life negatively (she was prone to just giving up on schoolwork, bail on hanging out with me or friends, decide to start a fight with her mom that when she was sober trying to work out the issues of the past). On top of this, I also had a VERY bad reaction to weed that led me into a delusional paranoia for a year and severe psychosis for a few years that still pops up from time to time (though I'm perfectly aware of it and how to calm down now). After that, I was a cocaine addict for about a year trying to deal with that psychosis. I dropped out of college the first time because of my problem with cocaine, alcoholism got in the mix, and I threw my life away. I managed to get back on track right before we started dating. So, I obviously hate drugs, because I can't handle them on both ends of that spectrum. She kept getting me into situations where she'd get high on whatever and I couldn't get out (got me drunk so I couldn't drive home, call me controlling when I said I didn't want her to because it causes that psychosis to flare up or I get cravings). 

In terms of fighting, my sitch was very similar to yours. Good days were amazing, bad days were absolute nightmares. Praying for the good days, I stuck around. A nice walk on a sunny day in the park could turn into full on warfare at home later. And she was hostile and quick to try and manipulate, which I'd immediately call her out for, and things would get ugly quick. Getting gaslighted was such a piss off cause she'd try and make me out to be guilty for everything, which I kept my grounds cause another ex had tried that on me in the past and it didn't work then either. Me always getting accused of complete bullshit when I'd try to have a conversation and get through to her. She'd promise not to trap me in situations where I couldn't leave and she was getting high on whatever it was she was doing that day. Then she would. Then I'd be the bad guy and the crazy one for not liking drugs. I had explained my history with them to her countless times and she always acted like she was so sorry and guilty feeling. Didn't hold for long though. 

Back to the breaking point: she told me she was going to do harder drugs right before I was going to drive us to her grandma's house two hours away. Hated being around her when she was high on anything and she knew that but always thought she could convince me otherwise, and I'm not about to deal with that in a car alone together for two hours. Gave up on the relationship right then and there when she told me. Hurt like a bitch but I was officially done. Dropped her off, waited a few days to sort my self out, went straight to her house with all her stuff and told her what was up and that I wanted my stuff back. The kicker was she didn't seem to care at all, and I could tell right off the bat that she was high as a kite on something when I broke up with her. 

Now, I have trust issues (both from her and another ex, way more from this one though), however I know the red flags for my next partner. And I'm working on the baggage brought on by that relationship. I've refused to date since (until I start college for the second time in a few weeks) and it's been scary, but I'm doing SO much better now. Relieved and figured out what I wanted in life. Doing the solo thing, which as scary as it is, you adapt to and come to understand that the only eyes you see life through are yours, so don't waste it with shitty people! 

Some red flags were that she had never dumped someone, her exes had always dumped her. Every ex she talked about was terrible in some way to her. All of them cheated or abused her or something, when reality is she just wanted a reason to feel justified so she lied. She threatened suicide to the one before me when he cut her out. She lied a lot and it was very transparent, whether to me, her mom, her sister, etc. and everyone called her out on it, but she kept it up. Lots of this stuff came out after the fact when my coworker who stopped being friends with her a while back told me about her antics. There's more but those are just off the top of my head. 

A relationship isn't supposed to have high highs and low lows. It should stay a consistent level, with bumps in the road every now and then. It should be a happy thing, not an infatuatedly happy peak and an absolute heartbreak low every few days. Learned that in my first relationship. 

This whole ordeal went down a few months ago, and I'm doing good now. Much better than I was in the relationship. And don't put it on you‚Äì some people just don't work together and turn crazy together, and once out, go back to not being crazy, since there's no fuel for that fire anymore. 

So with that, I hope you understand and consider leaving and never looking back. Bad relationships are a waste of our temporary time on earth. You'll know when you're in a good one"

So by that logic the longest standing employee was a terrible representation of turnover and employee satisfaction.

How much do you spend on health care alone?

How much do you pay for your family? Whether i had 0 kids or 8 i still paid the same.

How much do you put away towards retirement? 

If you died how much did your employer pay out to help with costs? 

How much is your pay scale compared to union? Where i live it is 3-6 dollars less.

Union dues are very little compared to how much most people have to pay. Plus you have representation if your employer decides to be cheeky. 

The unions around me are not hard to get into. They are very low on man power. In the 80‚Äôs it was ran like a country club but it‚Äôs not that way anymore. People talk about getting laid off, do your job and don‚Äôt give the foreman lip. This applies with any company. "

11022,"As a carpenter, I ask what their status is with their suppliers and subcontractors. I‚Äôve even go as far as asking them for references. The last time I changed jobs, I wanted it to be my last job and the economy was really strong in my area. So there were a lot of people looking for lead carpenters and supervisors. I had multiple offers and in order to decide, called their sub contractors (roofers, drywallers, painters) and asked how they liked working with them. I asked them and their material suppliers  if they paid their bills on time and if they worked with them consistently.

I recommend anyone who is serious about a long term job to do the same. Especially if you aren‚Äôt desperate for any job and are interviewing with multiple companies. And sometimes you can turn it around and make them feel like they are hoping you‚Äôll work for them instead of the other way around."

The bride's father made a big stink because he didn't think it was fair that his new wife (the bride's stepmother) didn't have a candle to light and got into a shouting match with the Bride's stepfather.

If it were me in your shoes and I indeed met God, my opening question would simply be, ""I know the pain I caused others though out my life and unfortunately I did not see the error of my ways soon enough.  If it pleases you, I would ask two questions.  First, could you please ease the suffering of those I left behind and let them feel my love for the rest of the lives until we meet again?  Second, will you forgive me for the sins of my life?""

""Encourage"" is too positive a word, and the phrasing suggests that they think you're more capable than the job description and are trying to help you advance.


In my field, the conventional wisdom is ""the people who get promoted are the ones who are already doing the work,"" where, the longer you spend at a certain level, the more higher-level work you end up doing, just because there's always enough to go around.  It's not a case of anyone being lazy, that's just how the job goes.

11162,"My husband and I got custody of my niece when she was five going on six. I know that's not technically adoption, but I also know her parents aren't coming back for her. 

In the beginning, she was a perfect angel. She was quiet, cooperative, and soft spoken. Today, over two years later, she's noisy, boisterous, and opinionated. It took me probably a year to realize that the traits she came to us with were survival-based traits--NOT who she actually is.

We've had a few issues we still deal with, like stealing/hoarding food, trying to keep ""garbage"" as toys (wrappers, paper towel rolls, etc, even though she has more toys that she could ever play with, all bought since she moved in with us), and intermittent bed wetting, but we handle these things gently because we know they're scars left by my sister-- her mom.

But! It's been amazing watching her blossom into a well-adjusted child. Before she came to us, she was ""homeschooled"" (my sister's boyfriend would give this child worksheets and tell her to figure it out, even though she couldn't read). The first thing I did when I got custody of her was put her in school. School is her favorite thing, so to the point where she gets really down when she has snow days. Her report card last year made me cry lol. It was all these lovely things about what a pleasure she was to have in class, how smart she is, how helpful she is, how much she learned, how bad of a sport she is at gym (lol!), etc. I've also cried at her seasonal music concerts and when dropping her off at peers birthday parties.

11214,"I recall very clearly the experience of being pulled through a tunnel of sorts at increasing speed until I could no longer bear it. When that finally stopped I was in a cave system with smoky shadows and maybe six tunnels leading of in different directions. There were intermittent voices coming from each, and they seemed to compete with each other. First came echoes of old, mostly forgotten but familiar voices, and others were unfamiliar and dark but seductive. After what seemed like an age I decided to follow the one tunnel from which no noises came. As I moved forward, the voices from the other tunnels I had left behind seemed to become louder, insisting me to turn back, but I kept on going. Finally I found a cave opening onto a garden courtyard, where an old priestly man sat waiting. I did not recognise him but he explained that I should.. ""we've known each other for so long"" he said. ""You know the rules, and so do I!"".. ""A full time commitment is what I'm thinking of"" and soforth. That's when I woke up."

11240,"My family too! The older cousin molested me and raped my big sister. Actually, he traded his sister to my brother for our sister! They both got to fuck a cousin! Not to be spoken of in the family! His younger brother molested (at least) myself and 3 of my cousins regularly. When I tried to kill myself at 11 years old, my aunt told anyone who would listen that I had demons. When my sister buried herself so deep in drugs that she had permanent brain damage by 17, well she was always a crazy bitch. When the younger molester was taken to court by 2 girls I went to school with, I was hurriedly pulled aside by my mom for a talk. She explained that  I should not testify or say ANYTHING even though she acknowledged what he had done to me. She told me over and over how the boys had been abused that way when they were little too and it made them ""sick in the head"" (Yes, that sentence right there left me with some HUGE guilty, conflicted feelings when I did start to want to willingly explore sex later lol) Lastly I was informed that testifying against him would ""break my aunt's heart"" and that it would damage how people looked at me because I would have to tell EVERYONE what happened and SHOW EVERYONE the scars he left on my genitals to even prove it. I didn't testify and my first suicide attempt was less than a year later. He got away with it and I listened to my entire family talk about two other little girls I knew like they were manipulative, seasoned whores. We were 9 and he attacked us in our sleep!!

Years later when the older one was about 40, he went to prison for having sex with a 13 year old girl. Of course she was a liar! The same trash talk of the child occurred  and I began to hear that behind my back, I was a liar too. Or a slut. Or both. Because no little girl gets molested that many times by different people!  I did get a triumph moment though. My super religious aunt was trying to get us all to send him money and petition for his release. I was an adult by this time and I was tired of pretending nothing happened. When she started trying to tell me what to put in my letter I told her, ""No. He got 40 years. It's not enough. Maybe it's a year for all of the girls who didn't get to tell."" My aunt responded by calling me a liar to my face... until her daughter stood up crying and said it had happened to her too so it was all true. The damn broke and 4 more female cousins admitted sexual abuse and rape by the older brother and 3 new admissions of the same by the younger.  

  I got the help I needed but it took 30 years to finally see how fucked up my childhood was and stop blaming myself,  stop defending my abusers and the people that covered it up. I no longer had to sit and plaster on a smile (while screaming inside) and pretend to be ok with the man who hurt me so badly I'm permanently, physically, scarred puts his hand on my shoulder or leg as he tells a joke.

11273,"My one's a bit mild, but it did involve me doing some walking about in real life and some actual research so maybe it's interesting-ish.

A little while ago I was visiting Croatia, Dubrovnik specifically. The Old Town is unbelievably lovely, and the food is about as amazing as you'd expect from a Mediterranean town. The water is perfect too - clearer than most swimming pools and as warm as you like.

I was bumbling around a bit, eating here, drinking there (by the way, if anyone knows what the dark draught beer they serve at the top of the cable car is called, I'd appreciate knowing) and visiting museums, architecture, and Game of Thrones filming locations (even though I don't watch it). Standard tourist shit.

Then I saw, from somewhere North of Dubrovnik - not sure where because I sort went for a bit of a wander - this little crescent-shaped spit of land with a little lighthouse on it and thought to myself, ""Lighthouses are pretty nice, I'll see if one of the boat tours goes there."" I went back to the harbour where all the boat tour companies were and started looking at their destinations and maps to see what's what. I didn't have data though I didn't know exactly what I was looking for. I did notice something though - that little blob of land appeared in the maps and aerial images among islands like Lokrum, but didn't seemed to be labelled at all. I even started asking the various people working the desks and they all told me pretty much the same thing: ""No, we do not go there."" At this point I just drew the conclusion that there's nothing interesting there so none of the tourist boats visited. It was a very small island, after all.

So I got back to the hotel, where I have Wi-Fi, and go on Google Maps to see if I could have a quick gander and found it straight away. The Island was called Daksa. Now those of you who have read this far and are either locals or history buffs are probably thinking, ""Oh you stupid fucking ignorant tourist. Leave it alone, you bloody, great tit.""

As I did a bit of digging I found two things: One, that the island has a 13th Century monastery there and I *love* ancient churches; and two, that towards the end of the war around 53 citizens who were thought to be Nazi sympathisers were taken to the island and massacred without trial. There has never been an investigation into those who committed the act. The bodies were left on that island to rot until *2009*. Re-read that last bit. Barely 9 years ago the bodies were first rediscovered and the last one properly buried and a memorial erected in 2010.

Whoops. I dropped my phone on the bed and considered. Basically what these locals had seen was a pasty white Englishman cack-handedly asking for a quick visit to gawk at the site of a pretty recent massacre. What a cunt this man must be.

So obviously I ended there. Except I didn't because I'd read a story [here](http://www.thebohemianblog.com/2016/07/the-daksa-massacre-visit-croatia-island-of-ghosts.html) about a guy who managed to visit. And my morbid (and photo-graphical, more than anything) curiosity was well and truly piqued. So I thought to myself, ""My last day is tomorrow, I'll give it one more try. But be a bit sensitive this time, you complete arse of a man.""

The hotel had an excursions desk so that was my first port of call. My logic (such as it was) was that they'd be more understanding and maybe more accommodating to ignorant foreign pricks like me, but this turned out to be a minor error. When asked, the gent looked confused and said, ""You mean Lokrum?""

""No, Daksa"" I replied, ""The little one nearby."" But the guy didn't look convinced. He was accommodating thought, and directed me to a boat tour company that I'd used a few times to get about the area, so after a quick thank-you, off I went. It took about five minutes to get there - just enough time for me to start wondering if I shouldn't just jolly well fuck right off - but the woman at the desk already caught my eye and I couldn't face the awkwardness that would be caused by me just walking away, so I approached...

""Hi, erm, I'm just wondering - out of curiosity - is there any way I can get to Daksa Island?""

The woman leaned back and called over in (what I assumed was) Croatian to a large gent, and asked something in the same tongue. The chap then turned to me, grumbled something unknown to me but certainly ending in the word ""Daksa"" and went back to his seat. Now I was really regretting it. But the woman still seemed inclined to help and she suggested that I hire a private boat, but that they couldn't rent me one from here because Dubrovnik was too far away. She then politely said that I ought to try in Dubrovnik. Her helpfulness had just started to alleviate my doubts when a concerned look suddenly darkened her (admittedly very beautiful, but then so was every Croat from what it seemed) face. She leaned in and, choosing dialogue that appeared to be straight out of a shitty horror film, said, ""Tell me, why do you want to that island? What do you hope to find?""

I did a quick checklist in my head: Island not labelled on map - aye. Island site of recent massacre and now supposedly haunted - aye. No one willing to go there - aye. And now corny but somehow remotely chilling dialogue - aye.

""Errrm. Well I've heard there's a memorial there I wanted to visit...""

She didn't look especially satisfied.

""Okay, well thank you for the information. Cheers, thanks, bye.""

As I was walking off I had yet another moment of introspection. I basically just told this woman that I'd like to visit a site that I *knew* had a memorial, and therefore knew it's history. At best she thought I was an ignorant tourist who was a bit fucking sick for wanting to go there - at worst she thought I was a neo-Nazi hoping to pay my respects at a grave site.

I know that the memorial is in the memory of people who were executed without trial and is not a Nazi memorial - after all, there was no evidence and it was pretty much just a witch hunt, so she probably didn't think that last one - but it's not beyond the realms of reason for her to think I might not know that. At any rate the whole thing is a local scab  - whether for shame or otherwise - that I just should not have picked at.

And that's the story of how I didn't visit a Croatian ghost-island.

11291,"In 2012, a friend and I signed up for an elective class called ""Story Design for Role Playing Games."" The first red flag should've been that it was taught by a theater professor, but that was only the first:

* The only examples she ever used for anything were from pre-2000, and were usually from the game that she wrote (which none of us had heard of, and googling wasn't much help; it's clear it was basically a personal project rather than a commercial product). If you tried to make a connection to anything published within the most recent decade, she would usually just dismiss it, and it became clear over just the first lecture that she simply didn't know much of anything about any RPG published while anybody in the class was in high school.
* The textbook was similarly ancient. I'm not even sure I have it anymore and the name escapes me now, but it was an out-of-print book by Prima whose examples were similarly old. Tracking down a copy was a pain in the ass, and I think it was the only textbook I bought all year from eBay because even the school bookstore was having trouble finding it.
* She had an participation credit system whereby you could earn ""XP"" for responding to questions in class. She made it clear that she'd try to spread the love by trying to make sure she wasn't calling on somebody twice before everybody else was called on once. Points were tracked with literal poker chips in a ziploc bag (you could exchange 5 of one color for one of another color to represent higher values); if you lost the bag, then you also lost all of your participation credit. Not only did she not call on everybody in the room on a given day, you'd need to answer about 250 questions (over 45 lectures) to get full participation credit for the semester. In short: unless her entire lecture time was spent asking questions for people to answer, there was no way to get full credit.

Needless to say, my friend and I both dropped before the first week was over. I felt vindicated when I was walking around Walmart and ran into a guy who recognized me from the first couple days and basically said that we had made the right decision because it only got stupider from there.

**TL;DR**: Once dropped a cool-sounding class because the professor's experience was solely on a personal project, the textbook was so old as to be hard for the school bookstore to get enough copies, and it was literally impossible to get full credit.

11323,"I mean, he did create his entire solo career off of his then-girlfriend Britney Spears **allegedly** cheating on him. She never admitted to it, but somehow that gave him the liberty to create a music video (Cry Me a River) in which he literally shows a Britney look-alike. It's a really grotesque way of treating someone, even if they did cheat on you.

Multiple reports, including Britney's documentary, have all suggested that Timberlake had been cheating on Britney way before, but Timberlake chose to project everything onto her.

This guy became a millionaire by being a cheating leech and then blamed Britney for everything.

I honestly think he contributed majorly to her eventual breakdown.

Usually frail looking ladies or older looking ladies, sometimes moms with a small child or two begging with her. If they don't get enough money they get beaten apparently.

They also do scams and pickpocket- and it's actually almost sadder than regular homelessness because you can't help them. And lots of the pickpockets are kids (laws won't let the police keep kids under a certain age so they can steal and get away with it unlike adults).

Obviously not everyone from this eastern european country is a part of it but it's the dominant ethnicity that's a victim of human trafficking and ends up begging/scamming/stealing. "

 When I was in recovery, the surgeon (or someone, I was fkd up) told me I woke up halfway through. They told me my surgery was finished so I wouldn't freak out any more than I already did.

 The man asked if I'd felt anything. I just told him I felt my throat was extremely dry and I didn't like all of those people hovering over me. He was relieved to know that I didn't feel the half of the bones in my arm were gone. 

It was a 15 hr surgery because the part they had didn't fit and they had to get a new part flown in while I was under. I woke up while everyone was just kind of sitting around, making sure I was still under.

11430,"5 years of deteriorating behaviour. Furious anger outbursts caused by frustration and grief. Terrifying losses of control. Multiple surgeries where the man who wakes up is not the one who went under, and HE was nothing like the man you married. Coming downstairs for breakfast to find a terrified, angry man in the kitchen demanding to know where he is, and who you are. All of that and trying to run your life, still. Pay bills, do laundry, get the kids to school, attend their special assemblies, organise dentists appointments. Shield them as much as you can, for as long as you can, from the terrifying chaos swallowing the man you love whole in front of you. Eventually surrendering in mind numbing grief to the inevitable separation, his outbursts alternating with blank, black depression, both of them terrifying the kids. And by the time he dies, being so numb, so broken that you just can‚Äôt face his funeral. 

He wasn‚Äôt a monster, but he was eaten alive in front of you by one. Bite by bite for 5 years. "

11439,"Thank you for sharing this. My husband had a baby with his ex in 2007. He didn't feel equipped financially or emotionally to raise his daughter, (and the mom was a tweeker and actually had the baby in prison), so he decided the best way to give his daughter a good life far from her terrible mother was to give her up for adoption to a wonderful family. It killed him, and even 11 years later I know it hurts him. 

We got married in 2011 and now have a 5 year old and 4 year old boy. He doesn't want to mention their sister (because, in my opinion, he doesn't want to relive the pain) but I would like to start discussing it with our boys - at their level, of course. I'm so afraid that if we put it off they will find out on their own and resent us for not being forthcoming.  I don't know if it is age appropriate yet, but you started the wheels turning for me.

I think we come from a stance of, ""why bring in another life when there are already so many damaged kids who need love?"".

I would also have to say I have a big bias against having kids from an economical, ethical  and environmental stance. Kids cost a lot of money and most people have kids without being able to afford them, I also have somewhat of a belief that having kids is selfish and humans are literally the worst thing for the environment.

- Use seasonings. Pepper, Salt, Lemon Pepper, Chili Flakes, Paprika, Garlic Powder, whatever ones you are a fan of.

- Instead of just mayo or mustard go for different spreads. Sriracha, Chipotle, Ranch, depending on what meats and veggies you are putting in, some salad dressing are great. Even mix some up, for example BBQ sauce and Mayo. Avocado is great for smashing and using as a spread also.

- Try using different greens instead of just lettuce. Cabbage, Kale, Spinach, even just Cilantro.

- ALWAYS toast your bread

- Add an over easy egg. If I have the chance I will add it to almost any savory sandwich.

- If you have square bread always cut diagonally. It will always taste better than cutting vertically or horizontally."

It's about 3ft tall, and honestly looks more than a bit like Dobby, but with no visible ears. 

Another time, I was playing drums. My drums face towards the small bathroom down there. As i'm playing, the bathroom door opens and a large bat comes flying directly towards my face. I jumped to the floor so it didn't hit me, but then there was no bat in the room. 

YET ANOTHER TIME, I was playing drums, and a massive moth appeared. Imagine a big imperial moth, but all white, and double the size. I thought it was a bird. I took a heavy sheet music book and smashed the moth against the wall. I lifted the book, and there wasn't a trace of anything. There was no way a creature this large could dart out of sight that quickly.

my friend looks, sees the Nun to which i respond ""Nuns can fly ya know""

The only thing that was a major downside was my brothers were natural geniuses. They did extremely well in school with little effort and scored crazy high on standardized testing.

The interview consisted of three distinguished academics in a stuffy room showing me photos of ducks and asking me to identify the species. I knew absolutely nothing about ducks and surely misidentified every single one.

Eventually the 3 interviewers exclaimed ‚ÄúDo you have any experience with birds at all?!‚Äù. Realizing there was no chance of getting this job I tried to make light of the situation and replied ‚ÄúWell, I help my uncle butcher chickens every year‚Äù. 

The three of them sat in stunned silence before finally ending the interview. I‚Äôm sure they still tell the story of the crazy bird murderer applying for a job at the waterfowl conservation group."

So, he goes to meet James Corden who literally PUSHES HIM --A KID WITH CANCER-- OUT OF HIS WAY so that he could go brown nose with some A-list celebrities.

THEY HAVE 3 EYES! So the main predator that goes after these guys in the wild are birds, so they developed a unique way of spotting them, namely a third eye right on top of their head called a Parietal Eye. Now this isn't a full eye mind you. 

You see the way normal eyes work is at the back of your eye where the light is focused by your iris you have a dart board of nerve cells. In the center of the board you have cone cells, which are great at seeing detail and differentiating colour, whereas round the edge you have rod cells which work well in differentiating light/shade. You ever noticed you can see stars in the night sky easier with your peripheral vision? That's your rod cells doing what they do best!

So somewhere along the evolutionary line, a bunch of rod cells got dumped on the top of Chinese Water Dragon's heads. So if a bird flies over they see the drop in light intensity and immediately haul ass, often by dropping from the branch they're chilling on, into a river below, which leads me to my next fact.

These guys can HOLD THEIR BREATH FOR 60 MINUTES! They will happily fall asleep under water whilst waiting for some predator to fuck off. I own one of these guys and he scared the shit out of me when he first did this.

Irish people don't give a fuck but it doesn't represent the culture, just a day to pinch people and drink.}

11940,"It was the fourth or fifth night that I'd spent in my new apartment, having recently moved from San Francisco to Baton Rouge. While the two cities weren't nearly as dissimilar as I'd feared, there were still a number of differences between them... like the cacophony of insects that seemed to be perpetually present outside my bedroom window. To make matters worse, I hadn't yet received my furniture, which meant that I was sleeping (or at least attempting to sleep) on an air mattress, so the combination of sounds and sensations was working wonders at keeping me awake.

On its own, this set of circumstances was certainly annoying, but not at all scary. That changed when a new sound reached my ears: As I was lying there, trying to mentally drown out the bug-based chorus, an utterly alien noise pierced through the night, its nature not unlike a low, mournful howl crossed with the deepest and most furious bark I'd ever encountered. If you were to imagine a bear shouting in anguish and rage, you wouldn't be far off from envisioning what I heard... and if you were to then dump a glass of ice water down your spine, you'd have a decent idea of how it made me feel.

Maybe I was just homesick, or maybe a lack of sleep had left me more sensitive to strange sounds in the darkness. Either way, I was suddenly gripped by panic, wondering what could be out there. I knew that Louisiana was home to alligators, and I wondered if I was hearing the hunting cries of one. Although the rational part of my mind tried to argue that an oversize lizard couldn't possibly enter my house, I was nonetheless frozen by a variety of fear that I hadn't felt since I was a child. (Even during an earlier night in that location, when I'd thought I had heard someone trying to break in, I had been less terrified than the noise had made me.) The call echoed through the night at least once more, and although I'm sure that my mind was playing tricks on me, it almost sounded like it was moving closer. I gripped my covers, straining my ears to listen for any approaching footsteps or dragging tails, but the discordant symphony of six-legged vermin masked anything else.

Fatigue eventually caught up with me, and I drifted off into that restless variety of sleep that one suffers when their mind is still reeling from the effects of adrenaline. The next morning ‚Äì after the insect orchestra had decided to observe an intermission ‚Äì I stumbled out my front door, intent on walking the twenty or so meters to my mailbox. As soon as my slipper-clad feet touched my welcome mat, though, the otherworldly sound from the previous night echoed through the air again... only this time, I recognized it as being the call of an irritated-sounding cow.

Suffice to say, the feeling was mutual.

**TL;DR: An enormous beast kept me up at night with its angry howls.**"

11943,"The vast majority of women have those stories, unfortunately. Yes, it's usually someone you trust. I also think sexual abuse of children is *far* more widespread than anyone wants to believe."
11944,"Yeaahhh... you can tell your mom, from me, that she's fiiiine.

See, I got left at a rest stop once. I was about 11 or so. We had a big ole van and I was laying on the bed in the back because I didn't feel well. Wake up, everyone is out doing rest stop stuff. I suddenly felt WAY worse and bolted just into the tree line to throw up. Came out to see the van pulling out.

Like your family, they all piled in and didn't realize I wasn't in the van.

A nice lady stopped with her family and was rather perturbed to find a random 11yo just sitting all alone at a rest stop on the fucking TransCanada. I actually wasn't too worried. I was old enough that I knew that they would (eventually) notice my absence and given my fathers irrational hatred of stopping for any reason, it would be only here they might have lost me. They would be back. Eventually. 

The problem would be his even more irrational hatred of *backtracking*. That coupled with my mother's conviction that the most important step in any emergency is figuring out who is at fault and how exactly that person couldn't possibly be her. So for me my big fear was what my punishment was going to be.

So this lovely lady and her husband and 2.5 kids and dog named Spot are telling me all about how horrible and terrible and terrified and horrified my parents are going to feel and how they're going to dote all over me to make it up to me, blah blah blah.

I was openly incredulous. No, lady, I'm going to be in HUGE trouble.

NO NO NO!! Your parents LOOVE you!! They will be so worried!

Yeah, but they're worried because of ME, so I will be in trouble.

She didn't believe me.

It was about an hour later that the van screeched in, in a spray of gravel, with my dad shrieking in rage, frothing at the mouth, pounding the side of the van with his free arm to GET THE FUCK IN THE VAN YOU FUCKING IMBECILE!! as my mother yelled about how could I be so fucking stupid, etc from the passenger side. 

I said thank you to the nice lady, and got in the van. 

I actually did not get in as much trouble as I thought I might, and it took me years to figure out why. It was because I quite naturally chirped that the nice lady had been so nice and stayed with me the whole hour and gosh wasn't it silly she thought they would feel bad or something? That I had told her all about how much trouble I would be in and she didn't believe me! Isn't that weird? They exchanged a look and peeled out post haste... Because they knew after that performance this broad would likely be taking down a licence plate # and making a report or something. And I guess it occurred to them that most parents would have been primarily worried and upset and ashamed of *themselves*, not livid at a child for accidentally being left behind.

So please, tell your mom, from me, that it is not our parenting failures that make us fail at parenting, but how we react to them. Anyone can lose track of a child. I've done it myself. But not being an ass about it... THAT's the part that makes a good or bad parent."

Don't much feel like cooking jack shit.  Pizza is the perfect solution.  Get on the site, order up a couple pizzas doing that 2 or more for $5.99 each deal.  For an hour and a half I stared at this online tracker not making any progress and nobody coming to my door.  I call the place up, I'm done.  Just fuck the thing and give me a refund.  I should note the phone doesn't ring, you just get put on some kind of hold listening to Dominos propaganda and ads until someone on their end answers the phone.  I sit there for another 15 to 20 minutes listening to the Dominos on hold bullshit and finally get irritated, put the fucker on speaker phone, and drive to the goddamn store.  I get there, and granted I have no idea what their load for delivery orders were but I only see one other guy in there waiting for his food.  Place isn't slammed with walk-ins anyways.  So I get to the counter, with their phone line playing their hold stuff on speaker phone just blaring and I set my phone down on the counter.  Asked them if they ever plan on answering their fucking phone.  By now I've been on hold for 40 minutes.  Tell them it's bullshit I'm waiting over an hour and a half for a delivery and even more bullshit that I can't even fucking call them up to cancel the cock sucker and get a refund.  They tell me when they're this slammed (I'm looking around at a practically dead store but like I said, no idea what their delivery queue was like so maybe) that they disconnect their phone and he was rocking an attitude saying it.  So I told him ""Well, then I'm coming here in person to give you good news, you got one less fucking customer on your plate!  I just want my money back, fuck the pizza.""

To their credit they pulled some pizzas out of their ass and gave them to me and still gave me a refund.  I'll grant that.  But man, I was fucking pissed.  I was tired, irritable, worked a longass 12 hour day.  I did not want to leave the goddamn house and go fight shitty traffic and stupid idiots to cancel an order in person that I had been trying to cancel over the phone for 40 fucking minutes.  Ordering delivery is kind of my go-to when I have days like that.  And I'm not going to give someone my business if I can't even rely on getting my dinner within an hour.

12056,"Of course it is. 

She had some mental health issues and I spent five years trying to help her. We ended up with two kids and they became her sole focus and reason for living. She found her strength in them, but had nothing left for me. 

 I started going through a period of severe depression and instead of understanding and helping me, she became resentful and felt like she was taking care of 3 kids instead of 2.

To make matters worse, we never really learned how to communicate or resolve our differences. Issues were simply swept under the rug and created a death by a Thousand Cuts type situation.

Of course, I'm making it seem like everything is her fault, but of course there are two sides to the story. I can be very condescending, and somewhat spiteful. I never really let her in to how I was feeling or what I was going through. I also became emotionally, but not physically, involved with a couple other women during the course of our marriage. She became very jealous and was hurt because it seemed like I was closer to them than I was to her.

In the end I experienced a severe bout of depression that lasted for over a year. I spent seven months basically in bed and decided that I needed to either leave or kill myself. 

I chose to leave so that at the very least I could be there for my children. I don't see them much, but at least when I do I am happy and can be somewhat of father to them where before I wasn't able to be anything

12080,"&gt;Yep, and so the insurance companies are put into the position of either a) paying whatever ridiculous cost the pharmaceutical company wants for the drug and passing the cost off to consumers

So, the incredible thing is that pharmaceutical companies have rebate programs in place to make drugs cheaper. There are these middle-men called pharmacy benefits managers, who negotiate prices and rebates between pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies. What happens is that things are set up so the consumer/patient pays list price when they pick up a prescription, and then the pharmaceutical company sends a rebate to to the PBM, who keeps part of the rebate and then sends the rest to the insurance company.

Where does the rebate come in for patient? IT DOESN'T. It never shows up! In theory, the insurance company is supposed to pass the savings along to the patient, but that doesn't usually happen. At no point is the insurance company actually paying for the prescription. The patient pays list price out of pocket and doesn't see the rebate. 

In order to look good and appealing to PBMs and insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies artificially inflate the price of meds so they can say they offer fat rebates and then the PBMs and insurance companies just pocket the rebate.

It's amazing to me that he is as famous as he is, because he's so DULL and very much lacking any stage presence. Watching him and Luke Bryan tour together was night and day.

Was acting like I had given her a job offer already asking about where she would fall on the published pay range even though she was fresh out of school.  Should note she was middle aged just new to the field.  Well it's a very specialized field so all candidates had to pass a knowledge test and even though I had written her off I took her to an empty cubicle and told her to knock on my office door when she was done.  She was back 5 minutes later crying stating the music from the radio in the next cubicle was too loud and people talking were too distracting.  The cubicle she was in would have been were she would have to work if hired.  When HR informed her she was not hired she had her program coordinator (my former coworker) conference call me and her to find out why she was always being passed over believing it was her age.  "

By an amazing coincidence, both freelancers were friends of the dude who lied, and decided to sing his praises on their websites.  They also went on to use all sorts of obscenities to describe the people who didn't get the job, in-between saying how ""unskilled"" and ""pathetic"" they must have been compared to their friend.

Being one of the ""unskilled shits"" that had wanted the job and lost to their friend with the faked resume, I decided they certainly wouldn't want any of the ""unskilled shit"" money I was going to offer them.  So they each lost out on about a grand of business."

Then she asked about my previous job and how difficult the editing was. I (thought I) said, ‚ÄúIt was difficult because all the writers were so young. But I loved the challenge.‚Äù Right after I said this her eyes went round as hell and her eyebrows jumped up a good 3-4 inches. I thought she was just surprised that I had the audacity to get pissed off that I edited for young writers, because earlier she had said that the staff was very young. A few days go by and I got to thinking about it and realized I may have said, ‚ÄúIt was difficult because they were all fucking young as shit. God damn.‚Äù

There's no reason whatsoever that you should be expected to put in work in a class without a clear image of where it's going, and while this isn't a legal issue as u/EverChillingLucifer suggests, it can impact accreditation.

Dolphins interlock together to have sex, while also moving forward through the water. The male dolphin penis is like a hook and the female dolphin vagina is like a plug for the hook and this is so no water can contaminate the sperm because water and sperm aren't a good mix.

12156,"Social media sites started off as businesses, then became information gathering sites, and now basically work for the government to sway public opinion. They basically get a stipend or grant and are used to keep people boxed into a mindset.

The Algorithms are all built for this sort of thing, getting people a certain type of content. They use it to create this uneasy balance of Republican and Democratic ideals, and keep it that way so that it's much harder for the population to choose with their vote. Since everything has become so polarized. This system is what basically keeps people from staging any sort of large scale movement against government corruption or lack of restraint by basically having a constant stream of ""Coservatives are like X"" or ""Liberals are like Y"" this way the two groups never cross and say ""We're collectively sick of Z""

This was a bipatisan effort until it was hijacked by a foreign power, however because of how ingrained in the populations head these training behaviors were it's the reason why Russian attackers have had such an easy time brain washing people, because social media had already trained them to follow these trends.

This is any site by the way, Facebook, Twitter even Reddit. Think about this, this site is designed to slowly funnel your view point with it's sub and desub options. It wouldn't take a lot of russian attackers to come in and make a few attacks especially with the amount of people who only read the headlines and comments.

Essentially social media is a massive opinion generator and maintainer and I believe the government had at least some part of creating it, and it's because of systems in place already that Russian Attackers have been so effective.

Also I believe that some politcal movements in the past few years were purposely created by the government(Either through direct manipulation or by baiting these people out) to decrease the publics feelings for peaceful assembly. "

Large public demonstrations of violence against these new police officers have so far resulted in no deaths and the detainment of over 1,000 people in New New York alone""."
12247,"It's a cult-like approach.  I remember working at a grocery store and I hadn't eaten enough and I was tired, I'd worked a fourteen hour shift, had five hours of sleep, and was at the tail end of a twelve hour shift that had started within a half hour of me waking up.  A mentally ill woman opened a conversation with me, seizing my wrist and telling me all about how the government back in her home country would break into her apartment to assault her and experiment on her, and now that she was in Canada, they had agents who still came after her the same way - and she had a bioweapon in her bag and if she wasn't careful it would kill a lot of people.

And my defenses were down.  For far, far too long I listened and I believed, horrified.  It was only a minute after she brought up the bioweapon that I had a moment to think *how does that work?  Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.  Oh, that poor woman*.

The camps aim to get your defenses down intentionally - not enough food, hard labor, exercise, repetitive tasks, emotional abuse, physical abuse, gaslighting.  

They attack your humanity by assaulting your senses of trust, autonomy, initiative, work ethic and ethics, your identity, your need for human connections, and the sense of meaning in what you do.  That's why they have rules like no eye contact, no talking to others- if you want to talk (or if you ~need~ to talk, because you go crazy without human contact) you have to talk to *them* and they will use that as a starting point for getting you to listen and believe.  I don't imagine the kids were allowed to chat and lean on each other.

When you have no defenses and your only sense of perspective is *them*, they can shape or influence your worldview.  You know that X isn't the case but it takes a certain strength of will to hold onto that knowledge in the face of a barrage of dissent... and your strength is sapped by the ongoing assaults on your needs and self.

You can tell a small child almost anything and because you're an authority, they will believe you, and to an extent the beliefs you give them will form a foundation that they carry with them into the future.  Get someone to the point that they're little more than a small child in their mental, emotional, and physical abilities, with yourself as the authority figure, and you can do pretty much the exact same thing."

I'd wake up sometimes in the corner, sometimes having shit myself.  I tried to commit suicide. At 13. I didn't even kiss a guy until I was 19, and all these memories came back, like awful and horribly detailed. I had a mental breakdown at college, became hyper sexually active. Tried suicide and cutting. I finally told my mom about it, she called me a liar. Then I confronted my brother about it. He never said he was sorry. He just , god he's such an assh*me, tried to make excuses. Im in my early 40s now, he's in his late 50s. Mom's still alive. No one ever talks about it. Had to see him when my father died four years ago. I flew in and he left the next day. I hate him for doing that to me, and I hate my mom for siding with him and never protecting me. She has the audacity to say, ""oh why don't you two try to get along"" the statute is long passed, I lived in another country for 20 years just to avoid him , I wish I could publicly shame him.

One day he pinned me against a wall choking me and the support staff didn't even get up to help. After about a minute of having a super strong bigger kid choke me, I kicked him in the balls and punched him in the face as hard as I could.

Obviously nobody wants to deck someone who is actually retarded, but after constant assaults and this time feeling like I was going to pass out I did what fourteen year old me felt was in my best interest.

Of course then the support staff gets up to help the kid and yell at me, even though the altercation has gone on for about a minute before my physical reaction. The school then gave me an after school detention which I refused to go to, which then led to me not going to school for two weeks until my dad yelled at the principal for letting unmanned retards wail on students freely (his words not pc but yeah).

He found it and discarded it but it was just a bunch of power moves, really. The last page ends on a high note of their stalemate, honestly.

We as a society have decided that it's worth forcing people to go through extra rigorous verification that they're baseline capable before we let them into these positions professionally.  Yes, it means that we exclude people who probably could do that job well but for whatever reason don't pass the verification but that's the price we've decided is acceptable for not letting wholly unqualified people take a shot at it.

The other common thread that these professions have is a reliance on the people in them to be _ethical_.

12468,"In many ways, but the broad strokes are that in many ways, I felt as if I had found my tribe.  The students in that program are a very clever and infectiously curious bunch.  I just didn't know that there were people like that.

Perhaps more directly, the first year's readings were a lot of political philosophy and history - Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus, Thucydides, etc.  Those readings and seminars got me to really think about what it means to be a ""citizen"" - both the benefits and obligations that come with that.  That, in turn, put the idea into my head to join the Navy.  Not trying to church it up or be GI Joe about it... I was also broke and love travel, and both of those were an influence as well.  But BEFORE starting the Great Books program, if you'd told me ""hey, SHIFT_DAWG, in a year and a half you'll be in the Navy,"" then I would've laughed at (and maybe even punched) you.

Early on in my Naval career, being almost 10 years older than my peers resulted in plenty of leadership roles (and obligations) to be thrust upon me, almost immediately from Day One of boot camp.  I tended to do perform most of them satisfactorily, and rarely got caught when I DID screw up.  Travelled extensively throughout the Middle  and Far East, made some great friends, and just, at middle age now, I'm realizing that by luck and providence, I pieced together a pretty decent life as a roundabout result of that chance coffee-house encounter. "
12469,What did she say??
12470,"I think it‚Äôs interesting to look at this story from both sides.
There aren‚Äôt a ton of variations in basic hair colors, 

there are lots of different instances in which a person can get back into something they originally gave up, and typically in any one of those instances there are several people that can be considered as having helped in the process.

Beyond that if the prediction never came true they probably would have just forgotten about it but the only reason they remembered is because a set of circumstances occurred that somewhat aligned with it. That‚Äôs just the way I see it though. 

A person who doesn‚Äôt believe in the supernatural might only recognize or remember times when a psychic was wrong and a person who does believe might only remember the times when they were right.

I tried to defuse the situation (at this point everyone is looking) by introducing myself. He literally responds with tears welling up that 'she is too good for you!'. His face then changes to pure, unfiltered crying rage and he just screams ""I can't believe you wouldn't go out with me and now your all over this CHAD"" (my name isn't even Chad).

Anyway he stormed out, it was just so awkward. First night meeting all her friends and you could hear a pin drop during the whole ordeal. Everyone started calling me Chad after which I guess was kind of funny."

When she dragged me to bed after I passed out (yea, she let me sleep) I remember hearing her tell my dad that they should drop me off in middle of the city and ""be done with it"" because she wouldn't allow ""it"" to be associated with her ""good name"". They brought me to the hospital and told the doctor I was jumped by a gang. They believed the parents of course... 

The 2nd time I came out (17) she threw me out and called me ""it"" and ""that thing"" for months. She called a few of her friends and told them I was an *f* and that they needed to pray for me, but that praying would do no good since I'm going to hell. That made me stop going to church officially. 


And when I tried again (27) she told me I'm an attention seeking whore who needs a ""dick in her not on her"". And to add insult to injury, she refuses to let me dress like I want, go by my chosen name or respect my pronoun choices :/ And it wasn't a hard name change!

My dad tlerates me but my mom, god I know she really hates me and she has never loved me. I don't think she's capable of it. 

Today though if you ask, she was at Stonewall supporting ""those gays"" and she's always been an ally and has always supported my choices. She loves drag queens and any novelty LGBT stuff but not a real, actual, unscripted LGBT member...."

A British couple lures young kids into a van, sexually assults them, kills them, and buries their bodies in a large moor. They killed at last 5 before they were caught. The woman, Myra Hindley, died in prison in I think 2002 after countless parole attempts. The man, Ian Brady, died in prison about a year or two ago. At least one body among those 5 children are still on the moor (which is about 400 square miles), not yet located by police. They took the secret of where this kid is buried to the grave. They're monsters in every sense of the word, and I hope hell exists just so I can know that they are there.

Edit: the podcast ""Casefile"" has a 3 part (roughly 5 hour) series on the murders, the investigation, the trial, and the imprisonment of these two. I only finished listening to it last night, which is why it's so fresh on my mind."

I never did get banned, thankfully. When I tried to explain to the guy that I wouldn't even know how to cheat, he got pissed and started calling me names and shit.

Not all conversations are going to be great ones where both parties are having a splendid back and forth. But the best ones are.

12717,"Maybe you should go look for a different therapist? I'm not a professional, just an undergraduate psych student but I took a graduate level course on how to connect with clients and how to guide then through therapy. I learned that it can be important to have the client understand why we're doing a certain approach (ie why psychodynamic) or what exactly the process is and what to expect (ie treating phobias, or explaining the basics of cognitive behavioral therapy). Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't but communication is crucial. Giving homework can be an important part of the process, and so is keeping track of progress so you have a record that you can look back upon and really see that you've changed.

Therapists are not one size fits all, maybe you and your therapist are just not a good fit. If you feel like your needs aren't being met, maybe your therapist's way of doing therapy just doesn't work for you and that's valid and okay for both sides. I would suggest shopping around for a new therapist and possibly get some referrals to see if you can find someone with an approach that works better for you. Go meet some other professionals and give them an overview of why you're going to therapy, and why you think it didn't work with your current therapist.

Therapy can really help and isn't just venting, please don't give up on it. There's value in it beyond just meeting someone for an hour every week."

We're at +410ppm CO2, the oceans are acidifying, we crossed the 50% death threshold of the great reef in April, the great reef is expected to be completely dead in a matter of years as will vast swaths of the ocean, the Paris Accord is a symbolic gesture, the next five summers will be abnormally hot, our current summer ravaged all of Europe, European nuclear power plants were forced to shut down, nearly 60,000 Japanese were hospitalized for heat-related illness or death, children cannot play outside right now because wildfires polluted the air too much, etc, etc. And all of these current summer problems that already happened will be worse next summer.

‚Äã

Even with the Paris Accord fully implemented by all nations on earth, temperatures will rise by 2-3 ¬∞C. The temperature rise is already happening and the Paris Accord wasn't meant to stop it. The sole point of the symbolic accord was for scientists to phrase interventions in a more palatable way for politicians to take action. But the accord won't fix any problems. No technology exists that will take the CO2 out of the atmosphere. If all humans died today, then the CO2 will continue to exist for a thousand years. That's you're great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandchildren who will live in a pre-industrial climate if we switch to entirely green energy right now by the winter of 2018.

‚Äã

Life is not going to be pleasant with the unavoidable 2-3 ¬∞C of change. A lot of people are going to starve off, which is a horrific way to die. The global economy will collapse when China, Europe, and Northern American are inundated with hundreds of millions of desperate immigrants.

When I first made a Facebook she once took a few pictures of me vacuuming the house as a joke (Haha, cleaning for the first time sort of thing), but then she tagged me on Facebook and everyone at school harrassed me over them. And anytime I say no because I like my privacy she starts crying saying shit like ""I'm your mother, and I just want people to know I love you and I'm proud of you, is that so wrong?"" She gets VERY upset when I reply by saying ""I'm your son, cant you just respect my wishes?""
Edit: just to clarify a few things, I'm no longer a minor and have been in college for a while. She still pulls the same bullshit about me not wanting to be in pictures, but she accepts the no tagging rule (although shes noticeably bitter about it). Any photo she did tag me in I removed the tag after 24 hours in hopes that after that much time all of her friends who act like they know me on there would be done commenting on it so she wouldn't get notifications about the photo so she wouldn't notice the missing tag.

12767,"To start off - I work in a dental office.

I will say that although it's easy to say 'take care of your teeth' it's not easy to do so. It's VERY expensive. Even people with dental insurance are paying 200-800 a pop for some things. If you don't have the extra money, and a lot of people don't, it's not really easy to do. A lot of people SHOULD prioritize their teeth but we don't because they do their job and we don't think about it. But that's about all our organs.

I mean the only option for a lot of people with a bad tooth in the back of the mouth (the 2nd molar) is an extraction, and after that they have the option of a dental implant.... and that's it. Implants are usually only covered at 50% and can be upwards of 2000 dollars for ONE tooth.

We just looked at each other for like one second and my dad went nuts accusing me of secretly dating the guy. It was unbelievable the amount of shit I had to go through that day just because I looked at someone. 

Oh, and I couldn't be too close with my girl friends either because he thought they were all gay and would ""talk me into it"".

She was great, knew her stuff about IT and had experience with HL7. I was ready to hire her, so I was walking her out of the building. There were a bunch of doors on the way out and I needed to use my key card to let her out the initial part. I watched her leave through the doors she was able to leave on her own and on the 3-4 doors where she didn't need a key card to open the door. She didn't hold the door open for a single god damn person that was behind her. It really bothered me and I hired some person with less experience. "
12798,"Well, my ""investment strategy"" for extremely volatile things like crypto is like this:

- I used to buy coffees from the store. I used to buy lunch every day. I used to buy veggies from the store.

- I now grow a lot of my own food. I make my own lunch with homegrown food. I make my own coffee and take it to work in a thermos. 

I calculate how much money I save doing all those things each day, and every week I buy that much crypto.

Before I started doing this, that money was thrown in the garbage essentially. Now, even if crypto goes to zero, it's no worse than I would have been before. If it does anything besides go to zero, then maybe I retire early.

I've been doing that for about a year now and have a surprising amount of ""free"" crypto, even considering the bubble popped. Infact, this is likely the best buying opportunity and investment opportunity of our lifetime - these next few months to half a year."

12807,"Lead is a heavy metal toxin that has the ability to inflict a wide variety of ailments.

Lead can replace other essential metals in your body such as calcium, zinc, and iron, and in doing so, impedes the function of the proteins these metals are associated with. Lead can lead to proteins becoming misshapen, damage nerves, and cause a plethora of neurological defects. Not to mention the anemia, pain, and gastric symptoms that can arise as well.

This is just a brief explanation, but I highly recommend reading [this](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/quantum-theory-reveals-why-lead-poisons/3003362.article) if you're curious about the chemistry behind lead metal toxicity."

So I go in look at the menu notice it's kinda sparse in general but didn't pay it much thought, I get to the register and asked for 2 chicken something sandwiches (forget what it was). The cashier looks at me a little perplexed and asks if that's it. I thought there was some misinterpretation since Montreal is a mostly French speaking area and repeat a little more clearly. Cashier is like "".....ok"" and I pay, I couldn't tell what was wrong but I knew something was off and was feeling the embarrassment.

12819,"No.  Effectiveness doesn't determine morality.  Just because you ""responded"" (whatever that means) to being hit doesn't mean it was okay to hit you.

Imagine saying this about anyone else besides a child.  Imagine a husband saying, ""Well, my wife respects me more and behaves better when I hit her, so..."" Or an employer about his employee, or even a master about his **pet dog**, for fucks sake.

If it's wrong to hit an adult for any reason, then it's wrong to hit a child.  And the fact that you ""behaved better"" to avoid being hit again doesn't justify jack shit.  A child will do anything to avoid *starvation* too; does this justify starving a child as a form of discipline?  How about waterboarding?

12858,"This should be higher. The markup on mattresses is amazing, especially if you go to a mattress store to buy them. That is partly due to the business model, mattress stores need a lot of floor area and personnel compared to the number of items that they sell than most stores so you're paying a much higher percentage of the store's operating expenses with each purchase. Online mattress sellers tend to be cheaper but they are mostly selling mattress types that can be compacted and shipped rather than traditional spring mattresses (although there are a few that do sell spring mattresses)."

After poking, prodding, questioning me he asks ""Help me out here, what do you think is wrong with your stomach?"" I said ""If I knew, I wouldn't be here asking you to diagnose it."" 

He didn't like that very much. He asked passive aggressively if I'd prefer an order for an endoscopy or to go home and have tums. I told him I'd take my chances with tums and a later visit with a different doctor at the clinic. The stomach cramp went away after two more days and I still wish I knew what was wrong with me. "

When they ask you if you've taken any drugs, it's because they need to know it. If you lie to them and they administer the wrong drugs to you based on that information, you might die. 

Honestly, most of them don't care about your drugs. They've seen gunshot and stabbing victims, abused kids and seniors, taxied the same mentally ill homeless guy to the hospital a dozen times. They do not give one single shit about your dime bag. 

But if they have to explain to the nurses at the ER that your heart rate is 190 because you lied about taking a hit of coke and they administered epi when they shouldn't have, THEN they might ask the dispatcher to send a cop over for an easy arrest. 

tl;dr Paramedics aren't cops. If they ask you if you're on drugs, tell the truth."

With modern medicine it's not impossible to have a kid if the woman is 40, and on the man's end, hell in the 50s my grandfather had kids in HIS 50s. If you don't ever want any, that's fine. If you decide one day ten years from now that you want some that's also fine. As a child of older parents who both lived rich lives before meeting each other and having kids, it doesn't cause serious detriment to the children to have younger kids. There are pros and cons to both, but don't do something that permanent if you don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a professor who I was really close with who dated this girl through college and grad school, and after for *twelve years* she left when she decided she wanted kids more than him. Married another guy, had a family, kids are now mid teens, previous marriage fell apart, and she ended up with my professor again. I asked him ""wasn't the whole reason you split because you didn't want to be a dad?"" his response was ""Well yeah, when I was a journalist in my 20s I didn't want to be a dad I wanted to keep following the Stones on tour. Now I'm 50 and I still don't want my own biological children, but I think I'd be a pretty cool stepdad. Her kids are in high school already anyway and they're good kids.""

They're getting married in the fall, Her youngest kid is I think a junior in high school. It worked out for them, and while I'm not suggesting that's a solution, I am suggesting that creating a new human is not something you compromise on.

12930,"I'm not sure if I was ""clinically dead"" or not but I drowned in the ocean four years ago saving two children who had been swept out to sea by a freak land slip and subsequent strong current. I don't really remember my last action before drowning but the lifeboat crew said they saw me and before going under I threw the children to them, they said the only explanation is a rush of adrenaline at the sight of them arriving and knowing help had arrived as there should have been no way I could have thrown two kids in that situation. To be perfectly honest I had given up hope as I felt my energy sapping trying to keep the children above the water as all three of us were clothed and I felt the lactic acid building up and try as I may I couldn't move my limbs any more, I was just telling the children it was going to be okay knowing full well I was about to run out of steam any moment. The relief of getting to them was swiftly replaced by dread as I turned and realized how far we were from the beach, and the terrifying realization of how fatigued I was set in and thinking that there was no way we were going to survive. After I threw both children to the crew who had arrived at speed with rescue gear they said I went under. Only by sheer luck did they manage to pull me out of the water too and revive me. I remember clearly not being able to see when I went under the waves and beneath the ocean (and as I started to breathe in the water) instead of fear I felt strong sadness at not knowing if I had done enough to save them. A couple of gulps later I must have gone unconscious as the next thing I remember is being revived by cpr (apparantly) and coming round. It was very confusing and I haven't really talked about it until now but the one thing that is deeply strange to me is that there was no fear at the point of drowning, only calm and the wish that I knew that the children had made it and they were safe. Very strange. The children are 11 and 8 now and living happy lives, thank goodness. It could have been so very different and I don't take life for granted that's for sure. Every day is a gift. Sorry for the long post but the original question resonated with me and I haven't really talked about it much since it happened."
12931,"I nearly drowned in the ocean as a kid. A lifeguard on his very first day of training saw me thrashing from 1/4 mile away and was able to get to me after I had filled my lungs with saltwater and sank. I do remember him gripping my arm before completely blacking out (drowning, btw, is a very comfy way to go, after the struggle and convulsive intake of water, there is a warm serenity...).

With my heart and lungs stopped, I was pronounced ""dead"" on the beach by trained lifeguards but they kept up the CPR until the paramedics came and shocked me back to ""life"".

To this day I remember everything, both physically and mentally about the incident vividly - way way clearer than any other childhood memory. But the period I was pronounced to be ""dead"" was a black hole of non-conscious nothingness.

*So this is kind of interesting: the scariest thing during the whole incident was after I was shocked back to ""life"" and was too weak to move, I could feel the paramedic undoing the drawstring of my shorts - ""OH MY GOD, HE'S GOING TO SHOW EVERYONE MY PEEPEE!!!"" my feeble brain registered, before I once again blacked out."

It was a pedestrian border crossing and there were 100s of people in front of us.  There was a group about two parties behind us in the queue that consisted of 3 or 4 guys and 1 girl. 


Eventually one of the guys wanders off only to return a few moments later with 3 Panamanian border guards. The guy took the girl by the arm and led her away with the guards. 


They returned about 30 minutes later.  The girl was red faced, teary eyed, and holding back sobs. She was also wearing different clothes. The guards then escorted the whole group to the front of the line.

Yeah, this definitely seems true.  Even on smaller subs I rarely recognize usernames since I just don't really look at them. 

Also, there was a little bit higher barrier for entry into forums - you would have to sign up for them specifically.  With reddit, you just sign up once and can drop in or out of whatever subs you'd like (except those on private).  It's not much, but that definitely contributes to the lack of community since a lot of people are just passing through (like if a thread from a smaller sub gets popular enough to hit all). "

I wish I would have gotten to know him when I was in highschool and needed an older brother. Being queer in a catholic household and being alone as the oldest was a nightmare. I think if I'd have had someone to talk to and look up to, maybe I could have come to terms with my identity sooner and had a less toxic teenage experience.

Turns out my brother joined the military because he had no supportive family when he got out of highschool, and has a TBI from a roadside explosive while deployed. He has memory issues and when we were talking would ask the same few questions about our sisters several times. I wish I could have gotten to know my brother before all of that.

I obviously know that religion as a whole creates internal shitty monologues for people that use it to justify external shitty behaviors. But that 99% of people who are religious are good people and use it as a positive in their lives.

That said, this whole Catholic priests molestation gong show is absolutely disgusting. I think we can all agree with that.

I do have a friend (buddies wife), who's a great person but vocal for things like the institution of religion, etc on Facebook. Which is fair. Again, to each their own.

Her recent post though basically said that the priest molesting children scandal is disgusting (agreed) and that it's times for Catholics to rethink their religion (which I disagree with).

I don't post on facebook to incite arguments or anything, so I'll just do it here. But I don't see how the two are connected. Perhaps because I'm a Catholic-lite person who perhaps is more spiritual than religious...but if you're a good Christian/Catholic shouldn't you be able to separate the two in your mind? I can't imagine that people blindly will support those priests over the children simply because they're Catholic.

Maybe I'm wrong though.

Overall, just because a group of people in an organization do shitty things - imo - doesn't mean that other people in that organization have to abandon that group IF they are a part of it for totally different and positive reasons.

13003,"&gt; Hey Arnold

Long post incoming. :P

For any fans of Hey Arnold who haven't seen the new movie yet, [The Jungle Movie,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMiE3yekxz8) which is the movie that was supposed to come out 15 years ago and wrapped up the cliffhangers the original series was left on, was released in November 2017 and you can get it for $5 on Amazon, Youtube, Vudu and iTunes, and the DVD is available on Amazon.

A petition for a 6th season is going on now.

https://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/912/288/796/

Petitioning worked in getting The Jungle Movie made after all these years. Fans were even [thanked](https://imgur.com/a/POCKw) in the credits of the movie because of it. Craig Bartlett, the show's creator, really wants to do a new season, as does the rest of his team, to continue from where The Jungle Movie left off.

**The petition has over 14,300 signatures so far of its 15,000 goal, which is what the original petition for The Jungle Movie had. (Update - Now over 14,600!)**

It was recently [said](http://tunestoons.mostlyharmless.libsynpro.com/ep-25-jim-lang-hey-arnold) (49 minutes into the podcast) by Jim Lang (the series' composer) that while The Jungle Movie ""totally killed"" and did really great in ratings with the original fans and had millions and millions of viewers, they weren't Nickelodeon's target age audience, who did not have the same ratings, so Nickelodeon has decided not to go ahead with season 6. 

**But he says that season 6 is now currently being shopped to video-on-demand services like Netflix, Amazon and Apple and others.**

Since this news has been released, the petition has been picking up speed and has gotten over 600 signatures and counting in the last few days. Every signature helps. :) It would be even better if people managed to go *over* the 15,000 goal.

This could actually be great news rather than bad that Nickelodeon decided not to do Season 6, as the show would likely do much better this way, with easier viewing and a larger audience and ages, as well as possibly allow them more creative freedom. It could also possibly open the door down the line for the teenage Hey Arnold spin-off series Craig Bartlett planned to do in the early 2000's called The Pataki's, that Nickelodeon turned down because it was too dark for them.

**Fans of the series should help out and request Hey Arnold Season 6 [here](https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest) where you can request TV shows from Netflix and get their attention and show the fan demand for it. If you do, be sure to mention season 6 specifically. Also tagging them and other video on demand services (like Hulu, who already has the original Hey Arnold series and so might be even more likely to pick up season 6) on Twitter and talking about it on social media will help too.** 

**If they get a lot of requests, they will be more likely to do it then.  Spread the Netflix and Petition link around to other fans you know too! :) Fans need to be persistent about this. As well as keep the news of it going around.** 

Signing the petition for Nickelodeon will still help too because the people running the petition said it is going to be sent to Netflix, Hulu and possibly others as well, not just Nick. "

13021,"I'm a clinical therapist and school social worker for children with special needs. When it comes to kids- we must remember that we cannot expect anything out of children that we have not taught them. We expect so much from kids it's borderline ridiculous. Adults can't even live up to what we expect out of children. 
Other tips: 
-Kids see and attempt to process more than you think they do- talk to them. They are capable of understanding a lot more than we assume they can.
-When they're upset, get on their level. Standing over them causes an automatic neurological reaction to a perceived threat. 
-Accept and model that it is ok to feel angry, sad, frustrated, etc. Teach and model appropriate coping strategies.
-Instead of getting upset about undesired/unexpected  behaviors, try to identity the ""function"" or reason behind that behavior. Then teach the kid a ""replacement"" behavior that serves the same purpose. I personally find that most behaviors are communicative. 
Children are pretty incredible. Take advantage of their curious minds.

Take away gangland murders and you will  find they inflate our numbers quite terribly. To bad that the war on drugs caused organized crime and with organized crime came territorial disputes. Most places that don't have gang problems have a very low gun murder rate. Numbers say one thing but if you look at the whole picture you can see where the numbers come from.

- Would the quality increase or decrease? The current system has certainly done good for me and I wouldn't want to pay more in tax for something of lower quality. Comparing the care I've gotten in the US vs. the NHS, the former for me was noticeably better.

- I highly doubt the organization (certainly on a logistical level) and administration that the US has would work well, and I really question the practicality of it- remember, say in Sweden where's the universal health care you're comparing 10 million people to 325 million.

- Who says that taxes won't be raised excessively for the personal benefit of the current government? Who says that the extra money would be well spent?

Sure, the current system could do with some change but I just don't buy the idea of universal healthcare on a large scale."

13199,"The best service I have ever had came from ""Saucy"" at Napa Rose in California. It's very difficult to sum up what made it so special, but he just hit all the high points that many people have already mentioned. Attentiveness - We weren't bothered but at the same time nothing was left unchecked. Educational - He described everything on the menu we were interested in, including a few suggestions we hadn't noticed, in addition to the specials, with a level of attention to detail and confidence that let you know he paid attention to far more than just the ingredients in the dish. This was someone who tasted these dishes, watched them being prepared, and understood what ingredients or preparations made certain tastes stand out. X-Factor - he was slightly quirky and funny and creative in how he dealt with the table. It felt special, always. Rather than ""would you like anything else,"" it was ""can we take this further?"" It made it feel like an experience, not just a meal. "

All are content with the decision, although I know my dad's brother went through a rough patch with his wife when they passed the point they could no longer have kids.  It's a tough decision to commit to I'm sure.  The hardest thing to face has been Christmas.  As a kid, we'd always go to my grandma's (dad's side) and the house was full of so many people and presents.  Now, we still go and everyone is obviously a lot older.  But some people live across the country and can't make it home.  And no one younger has had kids yet, both cousins, myself, it's down to just a handful of us now :/  "

13300,"holy shit, I never thought I'd get the chance to tell this story. I can't tell people in real life because they will never believe me, and I guess you guys will probably call me a liar too, but whatever.

I went on a date with Taylor Swift before she got super famous. It was right out of high school, when she was making a name for herself, but not yet a gigantic deal. I knew her because we lived near each other. It was the craziest thing, really, I only asked her out on a dare because even not famous, she was way out of my league. But it turns out she was really nice and enjoyed the opportunity to go hang out for a while (she always had a reputation as a girl who burns the candle at both ends, and she's always stressed, so I think she just wanted to relax). It was a pretty basic ""just out of high school"" date. We went to see a movie and I got to feel like a jackass rolling up to her super nice house in my POS datsun honeybee. Don't let her early work fool you, she's a rich kid.

Anyway, on to the crap you guys are actually wanting to hear about. So, after the movie and some dinner, we go back to my place to listen to some music. After a while, she pretends to be interested in checking out the hiking trails out behind my house. She said she really enjoys being out in the woods, but I figured she just wanted to be away from my parents. So we get out into the woods and very quickly get into some heavy making out. Clothes go everywhere, and that's when this story starts to take its turn.

Gentlemen, I have some things to tell you about Taylor Swift. First thing: turns out she loves giving head. Pretty much the most enthusiastic beej of my life happened on that trail. She couldn't get enough. However, she's terrible at it. She's got heart, but I hope for all future guys' sakes that she took some lessons. She's all teeth, and she's got that thing where her tongue is just ridiculously rough. After a while of that, we get down to the main event. Another thing you should know about her is that she is somewhat...hairier than one might expect from a super hot rich girl. I never got to ask her what was up with that, actually. So anyway, we're getting our awkward teenage bone on, and she's just as crazy as she was before. Except this time she's just straight up clawing my back to shreds. I'm not going to pretend I didn't make it where I needed to go, but god DAMN I was expecting some kind of revelation from her. It was one of those things where it is so disappointing because you had expected so much from it.

So, after it was all said and done, we're putting our clothes back on, when I notice that I'm actually bleeding from my back. I had known she had hear heart in it, but I didn't expect for her to draw blood. But then I noticed her nails were longer and sharper than I had noticed before.

And that's when I started to put it all together.

She Clawed my back. her BJ was all teeth. She likes being in the woods. She went on a date with a guy driving a Datsun Honeybee.

Guys, Taylor Swift is a motherfucking bear.

I must have shown on my face when I put it all together, because she got a glint in her beady black eyes and roared. I didn't even bother putting my clothes back on, I just ran for dear life. Luckily, I knew the woods behind my house better than she did. Even more luckily, I was able to squeeze through some spots that her 1000lb frame just couldn't get. Winter was coming soon, I knew if she caught me I'd be killed and stuffed into the cave she cleverly disguised as an expansive suburban home so that she could keep her energy up before hibernation began. I eventually wound up hiding in a stump by a stream until she gave up and left. It was the most frightened I've ever been in my life."

However, if the only time you bring it up is in a discussion that women started about their issues, consider whether your motivation is genuinely about helping men (which is good) or trying to downplay women's issues (which is not)."
13303,"I have a question for dermatologists. I'm a guy concerned about my aging skin so I looked into some anti-aging face creams and such but I've found that they're basically all really just fancy sun screens with a moisturizer. Is that normal? Is ""anti-aging"" just a scam?

From having watched billions of anti-aging product ads targeted towards women, I was always under the impression that there was something more in these creams and lotions than just moisturizer and sunscreen...

That's why I'm not using anything at the moment because I don't see the point. I work long hours in an office and hardly spend much time outside. Would it still help with fighting the effects of aging if I used it? Or are there other products that are better?

But fuck...every single new thing I do just scares the CRAP out of me. I don't want to fail at anything, and I hate not knowing things or being overwhelmed. My parents always used to punish me for failure and now that I'm older, I just punish myself. Which of course leads to ""why would I try anything new cause if I fail I'm going to hate myself for the rest of my life"".

13374,"Honestly, I am sort of technologically stuck in the mid 2000s (even though I am an older Millennial). I am not a real big smart phone / app guy, nor do I care too much about social media (only have a facebook that I use to just to keep tabs on old friends and family), but I miss the prevalence of niche forums back in the early and mid 2000s. 

Like I miss being able to discuss stuff on IMDb (before they shut their message board off a few years ago), or going to some random romantic advice forum, getting banned from that with a small group of other like minded individuals, creating our own site, that site going down hill and creating another and so on until people started fading out. I miss the forums, and that is honestly the main reason I am on Reddit. I never really used Reddit until about two years ago (and have since had a few accounts), but Reddit with its niche sub-forums feels like the old school internet / social media of the early and mid 2000s that I miss. "
13375,"first of all, it's not. 
some of my relatives live in saudi arabia, they have servants who work for them but they get paid. 
the slave trade existed almost 1700 years ago, after islam it started to tone down a bit, but then the extremists ignored the texts and just started a slave trade because they want money (speaking of libya) 
what you're referring to is the unfair treatment of stay-at-home servants that come from south east asain countries, which i have to admit, exists but not as widely acceptable or dominant as you think, it's juat a trope inforced by movies and the internet. "
13376,"I think that's partially because it wasn't possible to make money just by being an internet creator. I can't speak for animators and other creatives, but the first internet musician I ever remember getting famous was Soulja Boy. What's funny is that his story connects with another commenter who recalled never knowing what they were going to get when they downloaded music from Napster/Limewire. Soulja Boy would download popular playlists (top 40, hot rap songs, etc,) and then reupload them after adding his own music to the folder. An unsuspecting user would then download the playlist and load it straight to their ~~Zune~~ ~~iPod~~ SanDisk MP4 player, and would randomly get hit with ""YOOUUUUUUUUUU!!!!"""

""The experiments included a wide array of studies, involving things like feeding radioactive food to mentally disabled children or [conscientious objectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objectors), inserting [radium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium) rods into the noses of schoolchildren, deliberately releasing radioactive chemicals over U.S. and Canadian cities, measuring the health effects of radioactive fallout from nuclear bomb tests, injecting pregnant women and babies with radioactive chemicals, and irradiating the testicles of prison inmates, amongst other things.""  


""In 1953, the AEC ran several studies at the [University of Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa) on the health effects of radioactive iodine in newborns and pregnant women. In one study, researchers gave pregnant women from 100 to 200 [microcuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie) (3.7 to 7.4¬†[MBq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel)) of iodine-131, in order to study the women's [aborted embryos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage) in an attempt to discover at what stage, and to what extent, radioactive iodine crosses the [placental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placental) barrier. In another study, they gave 25 newborn babies (who were under 36 hours old and weighed from 5.5 to 8.5 pounds (2.5 to 3.9¬†kg)) iodine-131, either by oral administration or through an injection, so that they could measure the amount of iodine in their thyroid glands, as iodine would go to that gland.""  


""Immediately after World War II, researchers at [Vanderbilt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University) gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were ""vitamin drinks"" that would improve the health of their babies.

That being said there's only one event i can remember ever happening to me that i just couldn't explain. 
When i was between 10-12 years old i used to walk my friends home a lot. 2 of my friends lived in apartment complexes right next to each other and only 3-4 blocks away from my house. 
When you reach the end of the apartments there's a small community pool with a parking lot that leads into a bunch of hedges where the houses start. 
I was walking home as the sun was going down, in that weird moment of dusk when things are starting to get dark. i was totally alone with no one else walking nearby and i was looking at my shadow, i remember it was weird due to the lighting that i had 2 shadows sprouting in different directions. As i was looking at my shadow and walking i noticed a very dark shadow of a tall man walking quickly behind me. I didn't think much of it as i just assumed there was someone else walking too. One thing i didn't notice at the time was i never heard footsteps, just saw the shadow of someone else walking behind me.  The shadow starting catching up to mine, eventually overtaking me. It joined my shadow as if someone was walking next to me and then started walking past me even faster until it ran into the shadow of the hedges and disappeared. I remember looking around because even though the shadows looked like someone just walked past me on the same sidewalk,  there wasn't a single person around. I got goosebumps and kept walking but as i walked past those hedges i got this acute feeling of being watched that i couldn't shake. I ran the rest of the 2 blocks home,  and to this day i have no idea what happened but i know that i saw that shadow as clear as my own but i never saw a body to match it. "

The old, disconnected doorbell would ring. Lightbulbs would pop out of fixtures and shatter, as would the glass housing. But, the one that made me wonder. 

One night we had a family friend over, our boys were the same age and best friends as were we adults. The kids had gone to bed and we were relaxing and enjoying the company when a blood curdling scream reached our ears. Each parent was convinced it was their own child screaming. One was closer to the door than the others and had bolted to help before anything further could be discussed. Both kids were sound asleep, the runner was pale as a ghost though. ‚ÄúYou need to see this‚Äù she said to me. Now, between the scream, the run and the return I‚Äôd guess that 30 seconds at most had passed. She brings me into the kitchen, every single cabinet is open. Two of them were, due to height, only accessible to me. The four of us get a little concerned. Discussion and calming of nerves leads to no one being able to drive home. It‚Äôs decided they‚Äôll just sleep in the couches, no need to alarm the kids, and they‚Äôll just head out in the morning. I doubt they slept much that night, neither did we. It was a terribly shocking escalation. So, first light I venture into the kitchen to make coffee, couch mom gets up cause she needs some too.

Small fish, right? For us it was huge. Just to set the stage, I'm in the 14th year of post-high school education/training. I still have 3 year ahead of me. I'm was riding on a ~48k salary while my wife was working odd jobs to make ends meet. Resident physicians work crazy hours for low pay, and are expected to put in extra time after hours doing research, committees, and more. I wouldn't trade it for anything, but we've given up a lot to (hopefully) have a nicer life down the road, but haven't done much for ourselves over the last near 15 years. 

Earlier this year we had a small boost of cash from a few things all working out at once. The responsible thing to do would have been to put it aside and make sure we have more cushion for inevitable emergency down the road. We really needed some time doing something fun as a family though. Our daughter was 4, and the experience alone would have been enough, but if we were going to spend the money we needed to make it extra special (we certainly weren't going to be doing anything else like this for a while). We got the 2nd nicest seats we could buy, multiple pictures of the family, souvenirs for my daughter, and probably too much alcohol for me. The show was a blast. Our section won. Our daughter was selected out of the crowd to be the ""Queen of Love &amp; Beauty"" at the end of the show, which was that perfect touch to top this night off. It was the best night we've had this year, and I don't see us topping it any time soon. We indulged on something that I think is a side attraction for most people while they're on vacation, and made it one of the best nights of our family's life. "

13738,"Exactly! You have to love *learning* about things, and through them, about people.

People are the most rewarding and valuable topic, and you learn about them through just talking to them. And some of the things they say may be subjects you're not personally interested in, but learning about the person *is* interesting. Through the process you'll pick up all sorts of interesting trivia and tidbits that you'll carry with you, changing your perspective of the world each time.

Each interaction, each story shared with you, changes you and helps you grow as a person. Even discussing topics that may make you feel uncomfortable (like someone ranting about vaccines or talking about immigrants needing to be locked up and deported) can still be valuable- you get to see the 'other side' of the argument and understand a little better why people feel this way. 

It doesn't matter if the facts are right or wrong, it's the process of understanding *why* people believe them, why they're drawn to them, which topics they dive into with passion and which ones they avoid, that tells you a little more about the human condition.

We are such complex and fascinating creatures. If you want to learn more about how to have conversations, be passionate and curious about who we are as a species and how we reveal ourselves in mundane topics like sports and video games."

Obviously you don't open up with I-love-yous and showers of affection or anything, but most of that is because usually you don't know if you love someone early on and it would be unwarranted.

13800,"Because they've often already thought of the simply/easy solutions offered, and have encountered a barrier that have prevented them from implementing these solutions (and have also though of other ways to get past that barrier and come up against another barrier).

A lot of times when people want to vent, it's because after various attempts to solve their problem, they are at a stand still, are frustrated and simply want another person to offer some solidarity /emotional support in how their conundrum has made them feel.

Offering them an easy/simple solution can be insulting, as it suggests you think they are too stupid to have thought of that themselves; not to mention, they then have to go through an entire rigor morale in explaining why each and every solution offered won't currently work (as they've already thought of it, and have come up against a road block) which is exhausting, when really all they wanted was emotional support.

/u/MaleSeahorse 's practice of starting a conversation with ""I need to vent"" or ""I want advice"" is a really good idea, and would probably be helpful the other way too, like to ask someone who's about to launch into a rant, ""Hey are you looking for brain storming to solve this problem?  Or just want to vent and have a sounding board?""  It would definitely help to avoid misunderstandings."

The honeymoon was a cruise in which the couple were doing more ice and had a fight whilst out of their minds.

13823,"So rubbing alcohol to buy in Mass quantities is really expensive, usually you let things soak for a bit so you'd be wasting a lot of rubbing alcohol to properly clean the brush. Rubbing alcohol in general at the level you need to kill bacteria rather than feed them is 80+%, so even more expensive. Quats or quaternary ammonium, chloride compounds there are about 300 varieties all with varying anti-microbial efficacies. Are used in almost everything cleaning related but there's a blue kind for salons and hospitals that's nuts and easy to get. And is much cheaper than rubbing alcohol since you mix a small amount with water rather than just one liquid. So yeah while rubbing alcohol works it's definitely not cost effective at all for hospitals or salons. It's only sorta cost effective for the average person, but I'd rather keep rubbing alcohol around for cuts and stuff than waste a insanely large amount on a brush or all my brushes and most girls have multiples.

13842,"Ok,here goes the full story of how i ended up in a coma for three days and was in and out of two different hospitals over the course of two weeks. I was out with my now ex-girlfriend, at a little Halloween gathering with her family. We were outside having a good time as one does at a family gathering and im fairly certain it was that night i was assaulted by a biological stealth attack from an unassuming insect. Later that night as i got home i just felt really tired and my arms felt weak but i just figured i was just exhausted because we had done a lot of stuff that day. So i told my mom i was feeling weird and went to bed. The next morning i felt like absolute shit, i couldn't hardly walk straight, i was purly working working off my usual morning routine. I remember getting my oatmeal as i usually do and sitting at the kitchen table which i never do then nothing. I woke up in the hospital three days later. The way my parent's tell it i made it all the way to the front door and then fell and started having a seizure. After i came to in the hospital i just kind of waited for someone to come around. Then i got the standard questions: who is the prsident? What year is it? Do you know what day it is? All that stuff. Then they told me it was either meningitis or encephalitis having reached my brain caused the seizure. Then they found a blood clot in my leg after i had started complaining about my leg hurting a few days later. They put me on blood thinners and sent me home. That night i went to sleep i was ok but the next morning i was short of breath and had this intense chest pain. My parents rushed me to an other hospital, turns out the blood clot in my leg had moved up to my lungs.i was at that hospital for like three days just to make sure there were no more clots and to make sure the meningitis/encephalitis was totaly gone. While i was there i had a reaction to the penicillin they gave me because at that point my immune system was shot and these itchy patches broke out all over my body that was fun, (not really) but they cleared that up the next day and sent me home finally. Now iv been right as rain ever since. I know this was a long one sorry for the wait."

In it they always told us to check ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the felony and write ‚Äúwill discuss‚Äù on the explanation part. A lot of time if you have no chance of getting the job they will move on from the check alone. If they do hire felons you may get an interview simply because they want to know what you did. If you write the charges down they will read them and decide then. If you say you will discuss it and they schedule an interview; you have the entire interview to be judged on. Not just your charges. Sounds a little far fetched, but it has served me well. 
Any company worth working for is going to check. So lying only works if you want the lowest paying of dead end jobs. "
13872,"Sure thing.  (And to anyone else who sees this and wants to PM me on the topic, that's also fine.)

First of all, it's pointless to even venture into this territory if you're (a) still doing what you got in trouble for or (b) if you're not able to take responsibility for what *you* did (i.e., don't blame terrible laws or an evil system).  For example, I think the drug laws are ridiculous, and I think private prisons are a crime in and of themselves.  However, if I get arrested and go to prison for selling weed, I can't let my personal beliefs creep into the conversation with a prospective employer because...well, there's just no way to not look like a shit (aside from some crazy exception like finding out the interviewer is some kind of pro-weed advocate lobbying against the system or whatever).  **tl;dr‚ÄîYou need to be able to both say and believe, ""I fucked up, and it was my fault.""**

Second, it's imperative to be able to address any concerns the interviewer might have yet might not be comfortable (or perhaps even allowed) to ask.  For example, I went to prison for bank robbery.  In my interviews, it's important to me to explain (a) why I did it and (b) why those reasons no longer exist in my life.  If I don't specifically tell them why I did what I did, then they're only left to their own devices in filling in the blanks themselves.  I don't want them thinking I might've been a drug addict supporting a habit because then they might also suppose that I'm *still* an addict and who knows...perhaps I'm only needing this job to support my habit.  That's relevant information for them to have, in my opinion.  I can legally say *it's not their business*, but who cares about the legality of it.  The goal here is for them to feel comfortable in considering me as an employee.  **tl;dr‚ÄîExplain your shit.  Answer the awkward questions before they're asked.**

Lastly, be as understanding as possible of the fact that...hey, some people are just really uncomfortable hiring a felon...a former criminal...anybody who ""survived"" prison.  The public perception of an ex-con is not a good one, and that's our (i.e., ex-con's) fault.  It's not *their* fault that they don't want an ex bank robber working for them.  It's not *their* fault that they would rather hire someone who's kept their nose clean for their entire life.  And most importantly, it's not *their* job to help me get back on my feet.  I was fortunate; my first boss after prison was a fucking rockstar who was eager to give someone a second chance, and I'll forever be grateful for his attitude towards the whole situation.  But the fact remains that he didn't *have* to, and it's not society's duty to look after former criminals.  **tl;dr‚ÄîBe prepared for rejection and understand that it comes with territory.**

Hope that helps."

Because the shit is so compacted, when they poop it out it doesn't form the tubular shape, rather just staying like a cube.

When I was young I had a fever combined with bad pain at the back of my scrotum. I went to see a doctor. He asked if I had had any new sexual partners recently (or something like that). I truthfully answered no, and that I was a virgin. I was prescribed antibiotics. They didn't work. The pain got worse. I kept going back to my doctor.

Eventually I ended up in hospital with septicaemia. In hospital, they correctly diagnosed me with prostatitis and gave me appropriate medication.

Turns out all the pre-hospital doctors I had seen were convinced initially that it was an STI and I was pretending to be a virgin, and when the antibiotics didn't work they assumed I wasn't ill but got off on having my testicles examined by various doctors.

If they had listened to me and ruled out STIs, even after a couple of weeks, it would have been obvious that it was prostatitis and I'd have got appropriate treatment before it nearly killed me. "

After waking up I first seen these clips coming out of my arm that I thought were big long weird colored finger nails lol, that's when I looked around and realized I was in the hospital. It took me a while to realize what had happened, could hardly speak because of the trach tube they had down my throat, wasn't allowed to walk or eat for like a week which you think not eating would hurt it wasn't bad the worse was not being able to walk,  hardly being able to move your legs and what not is really uncomfortable. Once I was able to walk again I thought I'd be able to stand up, I laughed when the tiny nurse buckled herself to me incase I fell because I said if I fall your coming down with me (I like to try to be funny). Well I stood up for like a second and basically collapsed back on the bed, legs were like wet noodles. Anyway it took about two and a half weeks to walk around fully with the great help of all the staff I eventually came back a few times and gifted them baskets of Lifesavers candy saying ""Lifesavers for the Lifesavers"" lol.

I love them so much and I miss them. I miss them so much. But I'm going to be okay, and I'm going to live and I'm going to love enough for all three of us now.

Thank you for checking in on me, Reddit. You made me cry and feel so connected with so many people I don't even know. I wish we as a world talked about these things more.

I'm very sorry this was so long, it's late where I am and I'm really emotional after reading your messages. Thank you. ‚ô•Ô∏è

I think the outcome for straight people from this treatment would be just blatant misogyny. They'd still want to fuck them, but they'd try and demean and denigrate them to try and exorcise the ""threat"" felt from wanting to do so."

But regular food?

Anyone remember the days before digital cameras? I vividly remember driving to McDonald's, getting a McTurd with cheese, getting out my camera that was as big as my head, taking a picture, going to the store, waiting 3 days, and then showing the developped photos to literally everyone I know.

14118,"Water guns, specifically the Super Soaker brand.

The Super Soakers they used to sell in the mid 90s to early 2000s were so much fun and actually packed a decent punch - specifically the CPS (constant pressure system) line. For a while during my childhood/teen years, every year's lineup felt like an improvement from the last and I remember eagerly browsing through the latest Super Soaker catalogue to see what kind of hulking monstrosity I might be able to get my hands on in time for the summer break that year.

Unfortunately, they don't make them anymore - at least not like they did back then. Ever since the brand was bought out by Hasbro, and probably also in response to complaints from parents that their kids were injuring each other with them, the water guns produced and sold after ~2002 are a shadow of what they used to be.

It slightly saddens me that the kids of today will never get to experience anything like the epic water wars I used to spend my summers engaging in."

Doc: What seems to be the problem?

Doc: Any other symptoms?

Pt: Nope

Doc: What do you think the problem is?

Pt: I'm worried Its cancer

Doc: Why is that?

Pt: I've been vomiting blood 

This happens all to often so Drs will use questions like this to get more information. And second to relieve any worries a patient may have if they say they are worried about cancer and its something not serious. "

you are under no obligation to keep a relationship with someone who is toxic. Going no contact with my mom and her husband was probably one of the best decisions i've ever made in my entire life.

Also, the self talk. I tried imagining that all the negative self-talk was something a friend was saying to herself. that made it so much easier for me to fight back- helping a friend is way easier to do than helping yourself. so when I'd think I'm a worthless piece of shit who shouldn't even exist, I'd think no, you're not- you're a good person and you're loved.  It can be hard to trick your mind into ""forgetting"" that the two people in this conversation are just you and yourself, but it works.

14169,"The combat is much improved in 3, I agree it was pretty rough in 2. In 3, it's fluid, intuitive, and satisfying.

The world is pretty massive, but there's a ton to do; sure there are markers on yourap that are your basic ""treasure chest/monster den"" but the world feels alive. The side quests are the deepest and most satisfying I've ever played in any game, and often more engrossing than most MAIN quests in other AAA games.

Its visually stunning and sounds amazing. Just walking through a forest makes you feel like you're there (inb4 just walk in a real forest) and little visual or sound queues immerse you in the world. It's incredibly well acted and animated, and many of the characters are deep and complex, with their own personalities.

My only complaint is that it's a time sink. I don't have time for a lot of games anymore, and I need to put a good 2-3 hours in a session to feel like I've progressed.

Overall, I can't say that it's done anything truly unique; it's just done everything an RPG has to offer extremely well. It's set the standard for open world RPGs like it, and other than horizon zero dawn, I don't think anything has really come close.

Here's the creepy part:   After the EMTs came and got him and everything, we discovered why he had been up there... 

about 10 feet away, directly above the WOMEN's bathroom, we found a cache of hideout supplies.  Like, a flashlight, a some toilet paper rolls and... er... lots of used tissue.  Tons of candy bar and potato chip bag wrappers and drained capri sun pouches and water bottles.  

Looks like someone had been up there for days and days, just hanging out for hours, jacking it.   There were carefully and subtly bored holes in the corners of the ceiling tiles above each stall in the women's bathroom.   He would just go in the men's bathroom, wait until it was empty, climb up into the ceiling, and then crawl a bit to his little voyeur nest above the women's next door.

I‚Äôm sure this will sound insane to some, but i‚Äôm pretty convinced that there is a lot we don‚Äôt know about the universe, and i believe that our consciousnesses are a part of it. i believe quite firmly that when we die, we don‚Äôt cease to exist. because we‚Äôve always been here and we always will be, just like everything that is, just in a different form; like how, at one point, everything that exists now was once a simple collection of hydrogen atoms. the universe just had to take a lot of time to develop what would become consciousness, and bodies to house it, so that it could finally observe itself. but bodies don‚Äôt last forever. and we should all feel incredibly lucky to have been given the chance to be a part of existence that was alive and self-aware.

14259,"My grandpa was dying of cancer on the other side of the country, so I went to visit him for a few weeks. When I got back, everyone I knew ghosted me.


EVERYONE. (Except one dude who I will mention later.)


Even people I didn‚Äôt really know. I‚Äôd ask acquaintances in my Chem lab if they enjoyed their winter break and they‚Äôd avoid eye contact and walk away like they hadn‚Äôt heard me.


It was absolutely earth-shattering. I felt like I‚Äôd died and was a ghost. I actually went to see a psychiatrist and psychologist because I was convinced that I must be developing some kind of early-onset schizophrenia, because there was no fucking way this was actually real. I mean... what the FUCK?! 


Can you even imagine it? Having everyone you know, all these people who you talked to every day for years and years, suddenly start acting as if they literally can‚Äôt even see you. I thought I was actually mentally snapping away from reality.


But it was real. I wasn‚Äôt imagining things. The one dude who still talked to me revealed that while I‚Äôd been gone, my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù‚Äôs boyfriend had gone on some kind of weird hate crusade and spread horrible false rumours about me to everyone I knew. 


This girl‚Äôs boyfriend was pretty abusive and controlling so I have to assume it was some jealously thing...? I‚Äôd been the only person she was allowed to talk to, so I guess he‚Äôd finally decided it was time to bring her social interaction allowance down to zero, and then he decided to ruin someone else‚Äôs life just for shits and giggles? I have no idea. I don‚Äôt want to be an armchair-diagnoser but the dude must‚Äôve been SOME kind of sadistic sociopath.


The ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù part of the story ends there but the life-shattering part continues. My former ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù sent me a very long email explaining why everyone had ghosted me. Her explanation was that first of all, I actually was crazy and imagining things, and nobody had ghosted me except her, and she had stopped talking to me because my insanity and delusions made her so uncomfortable that she couldn‚Äôt be around me. 


And second of all, she gave me a long list of every single minor personality flaw or negative event that had happened in our many-year friendship - but it was weirdly minor stuff that no normal person would ever complain about it, peppered with some fairly severe insults. Stuff like ‚Äúyou cried a lot when your boyfriend of 4 years left you and it made me uncomfortable‚Äù ‚ÄúYour jokes aren‚Äôt funny and everyone around you wishes you would just stop talking‚Äù 


(That-one-dude-who-still-talked-to-me says that this letter was obviously written by her boyfriend, not her, but I don‚Äôt even fucking care who wrote it tbh.)


I want to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a tough fucking badass and I laughed at that bullshit email like the confident motherfucker that I am‚Äù but I am a normal person typical amounts of self-esteem issues, so that letter absolutely shattered me. Sure, I KNEW she was full of shit, but there was always a voice in the back of my head saying ‚Äúokay but she might be right though...‚Äù 


I developed such a severe sense of self-loathing that four years later, I haven‚Äôt fully recovered. And I still haven‚Äôt 100% convinced myself that I‚Äôm totally sane. I‚Äôm 99.9999% sure that she and her boyfriend were intentionally trying to make me think that I was going crazy, for some sick twisted reason. But 0.0001% of my brain still thinks ‚Äúyeah, maybe you actually were imagining things though‚Äù, and now I doubt myself whenever someone does something that upsets me. My life is still semi-shattered, because my self-worth and self-trust and self-love are a bunch of broken pieces glued together in an unsteady, crooked collage. Some days I feel like I‚Äôll never be okay. Questioning your entire perception of the world, and having your entire personality criticized and slandered and torn to shreds by the person you were closest to in the world... yeah, it does that to you.


She‚Äôs a huge redditor, I think she read every top askreddist post every single day when I knew her. She might be reading this. I wonder if she feels shame and remorse, or a smug sense of satisfaction in knowing that her efforts to make me miserable were successful?

14280,"This is sadly a common reaction for families and it is a common occurrence. That doesn‚Äôt make it okay, and I‚Äôm sorry for your experiences.

Instead of immediately cutting into it to check how done it is or eat it.

14382,"As well as my main job, I work part time at a rehab place. I have met Russel Brand a few times, and he is genuinely inspiring. Despite his bravado, he is very humble and admits at times he needs to keep his ego in check!   


He does a lot of work for Narcotics Anonymous, and although one of the traditions is indeed to remain anonymous to a certain degree, and he basically waives that, people do really love him. He puts so much effort in and takes time to talk and have a laugh with everybody at meetings and conferences. The only problem that people have is that if he were to suddenly relapse tomorrow, it would look pretty bad on NA as a whole. But I guess the same could be said about Eminem, and all other celebrities who personally endorse it. But yes, I digress. A genuinely and thoroughly cracking bloke.

14406,"A friend had a fear of flying. Then his brother moved to Europe. He made plans to visit, got a flight, and was constantly worried. Eventually he said it got better when he realized he'd rather die in a freak plane accident than live a lonely life where he never saw the world or his family.

Here's a (modernized) quote from Julius Caesar on the topic:

Cowards die many times before their deaths. The brave experience death only once. Of all the strange things I‚Äôve ever heard, it seems most strange to me that men fear death, given that death, which can‚Äôt be avoided, will come whenever it wants."

I grew up in a small town, where heavy drinking on weekends has always part of the local culture (or lack thereof because there's not a whole lot else to do), and I remember growing up looking forward to being able to go out and party hard on the weekends when I was ""old enough"" (i.e. Grade 9 when most kids around here started drinking).

Anyway, long story short, I ***really*** enjoy the effects of alcohol, and it wasn't long before my predisposition to alcoholism developed into full-blown alcoholism.

A lot of wasted years later, I'm sober 23 months from alcohol, and living back in my home town paying cheap rent at home. Don't have much of a social life because the majority of social events center around heavy drinking, which I avoid because seeing everyone enjoy themselves so much gets some dangerous gears going in my head.

I'm personally of the school that it would actually take more than one generation. A lot of technology is made with technology the user doesn't actually understand and how are people going to find each other out and rearch each other with technology and books also count as technology by the way; it's all gone.

I think _a lot_ of technology would actually be lost because the people whose head it is in would die before a way would be invented that would reach them to permanently record it; I'm thinking it would actually take considerable time for pencils and paper to resurface. Even the people that know how pencils are made don't know how to do it without other technology they don't know how to create."

It's not that you can't tell your kid to, you know, sit while you have a night out or something, but this expectation that your kids will be able to babysit each other is not good-- sometimes older siblings have serious issues (anything from mental disability to genuinely just being mean to their younger siblings) and heck, sometimes the siblings just don't like each other.

In all the panic I forgot to eat anything. Got to the hotel in Denver at around midnight....in winter. I asked the concierge if there was anything to eat. The only place was a grocery store 2 miles down the road.

In my hunger, cold, and delirium, I bought an entire shrimp ring and planned to eat it in the hotel room while watching a movie. Got back to the hotel room. The fucking shrimp ring was frozen solid. Had to drown it in hot water in the bathroom sink. Soggy shrimp cocktail for dinner at 1 am.

14649,"I used to work as a gate agent for Lufthansa and just have a couple comments. The story you described here could've really happened with pretty much any airline. It seems like it was just a perfect storm and everything came together to ruin your trip. I've flown AA before and never had an issue, but I've seen and heard these kinds of stories happen to pretty much any ""premium carrier"" out there. 

The other thing is that ""weather"" doesn't have to be the weather at your location. If the crew is stuck in Denver and there's a snow storm in Denver and they shut down the airport, then you can be in Las Vegas at 90F and clear skies and the reason for your cabin crew not showing up is still ""weather""--just not LAS weather, but DEN weather.

What the Gate Agent said to you when you got to the gate a minute after they had closed the flight was shitty and I think unprofessional. In all likelihood, they had already cancelled you from that flight anyway because they knew about the delay coming in and took a gamble if you would show up on time. If you're working on an overbooked flight, or a flight that has a tight departure slot, as a gate agent you often just have to make judgment calls and sadly, you're not always right. You see that a group of 3 are coming in late and arrive at Gate XYZ and you have to decide if you think they can make it in time or if you should take them off the flight and give the seats to other passengers on the waiting list. It has happened to me before that a flight I was working on had not yet departed and the doors were still open, and suddenly a passenger with an impossible connection time who I had taken off the flight was stood before me wanting to board. It's real awkward having to explain to them why they can't take the flight they had booked. It's rare, but it happens. There is just a lot going in behind the scenes that the passengers will never know about."

In the end she survived another two years, and while the final months were absolutely disgusting to go through for her and all of us, she was able to die without any major pain, with her dignity in tact, and looking really very healthy considering everything she went through.

14738,"Was 19 in college. Went snowboarding with 2 friends at some dump mountain in NJ. On way back at night we smoked a small bowl in the car on way back. I was passenger. Cop pulled us over for ‚Äúspeeding‚Äù which we didn‚Äôt seem to be doing but who knows how low limit was on small town back roads. Found the bowl my friend refused to throw out window Bc it was a different friends. Cop cuffed us all. Said we can all go down or one of us could take the blame for the rest. My other two friends in car apparently had been arrested for something before. So they said if they were arrested again they‚Äôd be in incredible trouble. I stupidly said I was never arrested so they proceeded to convince my na√Øve dumb ass to take the fall since it was first offense. Said they‚Äôd split any fees or fines with me. I agreed. Wrote statement. Cop was a dick. Booked me. I was released. 

I got a cheap nothing local lawyer bc it was my life and I wasn‚Äôt fucking around. 2 friends were pissed because it cost money and for a first offense I didn‚Äôt need a lawyer. Had court on my birthday, neither friend came with me. 2 fines as a result. The possession of marijuana and an equal fine for possession of the pipe. In NJ (and elsewhere?) they‚Äôre both equal crimes. Had random drug tests for next year (not fun in prime college time) drive 2 hours to freakin Jersey. 2 friends never came. Gave me almost no money for fines and when I repeatedly asked they would flip out and tell me to chill. In the end I got advanced some cash from my off the books college job and took care of everything myself. Thought they were my good friends but lesson learned. If I could do it again I‚Äôd let them both rot along with myself. Never spoke to them again.  Not even when they reached out on Facebook years later. Douches. "

You know why those things say they contain 2000% of your recommended daily allowance of whatever?  Because the actual science determines what 100% is.  The rest of it, that your body can't absorb, gets flushed through your kidneys.  That's why some supplements will turn your pee a different color.  You're literally pissing your money away.

Vitamin supplements got their ""legitimacy"" from a guy named Linus Pauling, who was actually a pretty brilliant guy, but definitely got it wrong on this one.  He was a nobel prize winning chemist who developed a kidney disease at one point and attributed his ability to manage the disease to taking large doses of vitamins.  So when he advocated their use, people listened.

If you need a supplement, a doctor will prescribe one.  But for the vast majority of people eating a normal diet, they are a total waste."

14816,"Close enough :) speaking about close enough...

There was this girl from work who wanted me to come to her house to smoke some weed, everyone at work called her 'stinky rachel', she was a plus sized redhead always in the same clothes but she had weed and payday was too far away so I ended up going and we had a pretty shit night, she was living in a hostel/supported living accomodation kind of thing in Hartlepool and it was shit, she shared a kitchen with people and showed me the fridge and it ive never seen mould like it off all of the spillef shite, looked like a custom fridge lined with green &amp; white fur; showed me the shared shower and bathroom etc and it was just awful. It looked like a half way house (where you go when you leave prison) and her bedroom was shite. She still had one of those old fat TVs that stick out at the back. Not very nice. We were having a smoke and she asked what film we should put on, with me being black I put Django on through netflix and we sat and watched that. About halfway through I realised it was getting late so I asked for a lift home, it wad a few towns away and she asked if I just wanted to sleep instead because we were on the same team at work and had to be in at the same time etc, I was in a relationship at the time so said no funny business (was my current girlfriend). I agreed to sleep and about an hour after smoking later she started banging on about how she used to be addicted to cocaine and would do anything for it but she's since received help, she replaces her addiction with sex because it's a good alternative for her and she said ""white lads are like a line, but a black lad is like finding a kilogram of coke on the floor"". Anyway I was weirded out so decided I'd pretend go to sleep so she'd stop with her lunatic ramblings -jokes on her no self respecting black man will fall asleep watching Django- and she did, she was underneath the covers and I slept on top of them (loyal). About 15 minutes later she starts really nudging me with her elbow, digging it into me like she a hammer tryna hammer a nail, I was just worried because what if she was craving what I couldnt give her. I keep my eyes closed for my dear life and she goes to the bathroom, I'm contemplating grabbing my bag and slipping my shoes on and jumping out of the window because I remember the door being locked and didn't wanna chance one of the other residents leave it unlocked incase I got murdered. I keep laying there and she gets on top of the covers and asks if Im awake. I kept making (terrible) sleeping noises and she starts nudging me again with her elbow going ""Wilson, wilson, wilson"" for what felt like an eternity, she says ""if you're awake im gonna put my hand down your pants"" and she tries to but I turn over and face away, pretending it sort of woke me up enough to realize what she eas doing. I knew what the fuck she was doing. She faces the opposite way, same as me, and I thank fucking gods of old that she is going to sleep this time. She starts really fucken digging her elbow into me again and it was starting to piss me off, I didnt wanna sleep there because she was meant to be my ride home but it was late and I've came this far so I get up and try to find the toilet, manage and fucking just prayed that she'd leave me alone so I could sleep. I didn't know what was gonna happen when I went back into the room, I tried to cover my back by announcing 'goodnight' to signal I was going to sleep, she returned the goodnight and that was that. I stay awakr because I'm fearing for my life and about to have a panic attack, she swings her leg over me and this is it man, I tell her to stop because she knows I have a girlfriend and I dont like her in that way, if that's what she wanted me to come for then I wouldnt have came at all I tell her. She says ""what are you talking about?"" Implying the horror that just unfolded for me was imagined. I showed her the red marks on my side off her elbowing me and she says I did that to myself when I went to the bathroom. WAT. THE. FUK. I get my shoes on, collected my bag, got my jacket and escaped Stinky Rachel's residence by exchanging the last of my spendable currency on a nice taxi so I could get home. What a fucking disaster, I go to sleep after nearly being raped and tell everyone at work the next day. I told my manager and his manager that I couldn't be on the same team as her but they insisted it was a new company and there were no other teams available for the job I wad doing. She got roasted for a few days because everyone called her 'not-so-slender-man' (LOL) so she started sending me death threats and the likes over facebook. I showed the police and she was charged with malicious communications but still could go to work. Anyway one day at my desk she insults me. ""I actually have a lad who wants to shag me now Wilsonater"". I literally blew my top and audibly said 'how many times did you elbow him and try to stick your hands down his pants before be finally gave in you desperate smelly cunt' and walked out, never went back to work there again. People's reactions were priceless, but I still dont know why she wasnt sacked despite what went on and how many complaints me and my friends made. 

Close one, I think if I stayed and slept she would have raped me. I haven't a fucking clue ehat was going through her mind and I haven't told my girlfeind yet because I don't think she'd understand.

To this day though, the worst sex ive ever had was with an insane homeless girl who enjoyed rubbing feces on her chest and putting period blood war painting type shit all over herself. She tried to put cigarettes out on my nipples. I still fucked her.

I saw a post one time with something like 150 comments all removed.

In truth, I only ever answered twice on that subreddit...both times I used Wikipedia to find sources lmao. It was simple questions anyway. "
14832,"I'm late but maybe thats a good thing since this story is so specific.

My boyfriend and I had gotten an Airbnb because I had never drank before and I wanted to try it. It was Sunday to Monday (the only available one  for cheap) and I had work the next day so we planned to be in bed by 12 or 1.  We drink, things advance, and I ask him if he brought condoms, fully expecting him to bust them out. He says no.  At first I'm thinking wtf are you serious but then I ask him if he actually wanted to have sex and that it was fine if he didn't. He say he does but he didn't want to assume. We get into this whole discussion about consent (I was really drunk and he was unsure about my ability), and how he was afraid the whole situation in general could leave me feeling pressured, and this and that, but we're both too horny and cave in. 

Condom buying time. (This is when Horny Brain took over the parts of us that should be used for basic cognitive function)

I had checked earlier on Google maps where the nearest 7/11 was for this reason, and even though I had no idea where it actually was, we set off in his car. I've never ran out of a house and down two flights of stairs so fast in my life.  I pretty much pointed in the general direction I knew the 7/11 was, and was like ""condoms that way!"" He speeds off . After driving around for a bit, we both realize we have no idea where the fuck this 7/11 is so we drive back to the Airbnb to grab out phones to Google it.

 7/11 located. 

We get there, both go in. After walking around for a bit, he realizes he forgot his wallet and says something about being embarrassed about me paying. Do you think I give a fuck right now? There's nothing on my mind except dick. 

I go to reach in my bag to get my wallet, and I ALWAYS have my bag on me, and realize- I don't fucking have my bag on me either. 

Get back in the car. Drive back to the Airbnb. Run up two flights of stairs. Grab the stuff. Run back down. Drive back to 7/11. Again. 

So finally we get the condoms, get back to the Airbnb, and use one. I ask if he wants to go again, he says yes . We end up using all 3. 

Somehow it's 4 am, and even more shocking, somehow we manage to get up at 5:30. We were supposed to clean up the Airbnb together but I woke up drunk and had a hard enough time getting myself ready. We leave late, and I get to work like 20 minutes late. I don't even know how I made it through the day, I was fucked up in 10 different ways. 

And that's the story of how my boyfriend and I lost our virginities. 

**TLDR**-couldnt think straight, had to take 3 trips to 7/11 to successfully buying condoms. Ended up only sleeping 1.5 hours before having to go to work "

14879,"I hire for relatively low-level positions at a manufacturing facility. That said, professionalism still applies and goes an awfully long way. Some of my favs:

14884,"Certainly possible, I'm not judging her. But if you went to prison for murder, the most important thing you can do is come up with some way, any way, to moderate the effect of people hearing that. Something. Anything. Because if you don't all you're ever going to be to a lot of people is someone who went to jail for murder. Not a person, not an employee, just an ex-con. 

I couldn't have hired her anyway. Her conviction would have flagged the background check. But in other job interviews she would have had a chance if she'd had a way to frame this better.

This is just a horrible mix of hilarious and sad. Did she not realize that she was exposing her nether regions to the entire beach, or did she know and not care? Maybe she thought she was hot stuff and wanted people to see, but ultimately it just sounds pathetic and sad to need that kind of attention. I can't imagine doing something like that and then having to live with it for the rest of my life, I know years later I would be living my life and suddenly, randomly, the time that I exposed my genitals to friends and strangers would pop into my head, and I would want to melt into the floor."

In terms of what is ‚Äúfun‚Äù, I can‚Äôt really advise anything because fun is subjective.

Choosing who to have sex with is a game of patience for men. First you need to sit by your watching spot for dozens of hours with your binoculars. Typically this should be in an area with a large amount of people that pass by. That way you can find the right person that you spy with your binoculars. 

Once you find your duck then it's time to start the stalking processing. Which means weeks and weeks of surveillance work. With modern technology it's a lot easier. They have super zoom cameras these days with optical zoom. None of that pixelated digital zoom shit.

Finally comes the kidnapping part where you need to get your 'Free Candy' van ready, prepped, and going. This is the adrenaline pumping part. The first time is always the best because the thrill of it all makes you feel like a kid again. Then once you're home in your basement dungeon and she's applied the lotion without any hosin' you are ready for having sex with someone you chose.

P.S Incase you assumed my gender I'm Male so I'm suppose have these things called muscles. My chest is meant to be very broad and my arms and legs are meant to be bulging with testosterone and repressed childhood memories of bullies.

P.S.S Also if you are 5'10"" and weigh less than me your body is malnourished, bones shouldn't be sticking out. Your sweat problem is an easy fix though. STOP SMOKING METH and eat some goddamn food.

Edit: My solution since I sweat more than most. I used panty liners in my undershirts and some heavy duty aerosol deodorant to keep my sweat back and I wore 3 piece wool suits.

Side note: The Nutritionists that work in IT browsing reddit have since told me I am fat and have reintroduced to me my middle school physical education about the Body Mass Index. (A metric that doesn't include body fat or muscle mass but simply gives a graphic chart for weight and a height and let's you know if you are morbidly obese. Who needs doctors anymore right? We have WebMD and Google!). 
It will take a while to comprehend and absorbe all this. Mostly because I'm thicc like the gravy that runs through my veins. 
Humans and their bodies differ from one to another. Like some are toxic and vile and lack any luster (see the anatomical geniuses and history majors comments below.) Here is another metric for the doctors eager to diagnose me. Waist 30 Inseam 32. 
I deserve all the body shaming you have to throw since I am obviously not intelligent enough to look in the mirror and recognize the monster I am, living in this short, wide shell of man who likes cheeseburgers and ice cream. p
Preferably together. 
I'm sorry my height is shallow just like some people's critical thinking skills, values, and personalities. I have since concluded never will I ever again think about making a joke at my own expense on the internet to point out the obvious. I will now invest in a Ford 350 (tree fiddy) that with any luck will compensate for my short size and be capable of supporting my massive frame. I will then lift that bitch so high that I can plow through all the tall, ""healthy"" people who looked down on me. They might reconsider their behaviour after the giant steel ball's, I had casted from my own, dangling off the rear bumper slap them in the face as I'm burning out through a Whole Foods or a Subway. Then maybe... just maybe... I will find love.

In conclusion that is how you articulate something other than a poorly worded and overused insult to actually dissect one's poor character and flawed thinking then and only then you can finally paste that link to the first result Google brought to you and I guess fuck reading it says I'm overweight that's you need to know I guess. Ugliness in the personality and laziness of the brain is not attractive. Be clever, be original. Unless you are rolling in money, but then just refer back to me earlier mentioning about being shallow and then take a second to recognize that you have no depth to your conscious life. The unloved and neglected miss out only because they are focused on other peoples lifestyle and how best they can demean it. My best guess is they do this to feel a temporary superiority or the falsely placed belief of elevated intelligence.

Probably [NSFW] from here on out
Another popular theory for why these people exist is that they are nihilist and recognize their existence is meaningless and bleak which alone is a hard reality to accept. Just look at Mike Pence. Now isolate that person because most people avoid stepping in dog shit. We have just created a beast neither man nor troll. Not capable of any thought that isn't negative, a bad meme, or an attempt at being condescending. Luckily with their low intelligence the latter is almost impossible for them. Turns out 4 brain cells left over after malnourishment can't process more than a Byte of information. That's not enough to even give the impression they know what they are talking about. These monstrosities are not sentient they show little regard or attention out of the screen they focus on for multiple hours a day this state of stasis as we call it can last for weeks. They pose no threat in the physical dimension; however, tread carefully on teh forums for this is their lair. Here is how their reproductive system works. Some scientist say that their small brain in combination with a small genitalia which resembles a pair of drying grapes in a dime bag make them extremely aggressive on the web. Don't mistake their genitals for a clitoris. It is actually a micropenis disguised as a defence mechanism. It resembles a clitoris so you are more likely to spit on them before you think to kick it. If you do encounter one of these creatures in the wild have no fear without the internet and keyboard they are actually harmless. Hours of typing away has weakened their forearms to twigs and the movement of the wrist is restricted because of severe carpal tunnel. Be wary of their malnourished on scooters a mass effect field be created. Using Einstein's famous equation E=MC^2 I will explain how. Energy is equal to mass multiplied by speed squared. So a rascal scooter going about 20 MPH, we have 20^2=400 but here is were it gets tricky there mass is believed to be infinite because a blackhole exists in the center of their head where light can't even escape. We use one in the supercollider. 
Rarely do you see these foul chimeras during the day, for like the mythical demons that plague our dreams and trailers they fear the sun. Some specialist argue it's because UV damages their epidermis and actually is capable of returning one to human form. This was witnessed only in secluded blacksites. Be wary at night for this is their feeding time avoid places such as Taco Bell, McDonald's, Del-Taco, or any other extremely unhealthy, deep fried, cardiac disease inducing, fast food ""restaurants"" that have free Wi-Fi and can make your arm go numb for $10 (U.S.) If you do need to visit one of these place out of curiosity or to get your damn google maps working since you have sprint data coverage have no worry. Years of cholesterol has built up in every artery, capillary, and vein a simple brisk paced walk can easily lose them and leave them winded as exercise is also a weakness. If you need to take one down I did so back in '08 it was a Waffle House in Georgia. My team and I used Moutain Dew: Code Red (The color red and high sugar content appeals to them. Research is being pioneered in John Hopkins University to figure exactly what wave lengths of light they see.) as well as a bag of cheetos any flavor is ok their tastebuds have decayed by this point. The abomination took about 50ccs of Ketamine before it went down. Horse tranquilizer if you're not cool. Anyways we lost our comms specialist from Alpha team that day. He happened to be in the shadow of that great collosus when it came down. The hardest thing was the memes they clustered bombed the front page with after. Rest in Piece Billy. I'll avenge you. 
""Big Bertha"" we called this specimen shes held in the previously mentioned clandestine blacksite tagged with a tracker and is forced to help identify others like it. She is actually Male, upon removing the fedora he had receding ponytail plus he was like a solid E-Cup bra size we don't have specifics on the strap size though. Continuing on, be wary on the internet each username is suspect. If someone calls you a lard ass when they don't know basic human anatomy chances you've encountered one. Any time there's a joke and your first idea is I'm going to insult this dude, call him fat. That's the beginning on the end. You're beyond the help of modern medicine and I recommend you get a library card and gym membership to slow the regression. If you're not using TOR and you're on the front lines hunting these bastards I recommend you download it so they can't trace and spam your inbox so hard that suicidal thoughts begin to manifest or even worse you start to think Donald Trump doesn't seem that bad. It's a cruel forums we live in but it is survivable. Now you're better equipped to deal with a psychological attack from one these terrible nightmares as you innocently browse the web.

Lol call me fat cause I lift weights.

By the way if you're offended yet entertained. Good. That's the proper reaction and if not you're not meant to read jokes or create them. Go watch cat videos. If I lost you somewhere in the explanation of all this Alpha team is en route to your location we will get you in name of Billy's heroic sacrifice.

I don't really want to die, I'd much rather live, but if I feel the same the second time around, it won't be unpleasant in the slightest. When I died, I just existed outside of my body. It was an unsettling feeling, but kind of like the butterflies in your stomach when going down a huge hill on a rollercoaster. It's good but it feels kind of wrong almost. It wasn't uncomfortable, just something I've never experienced before so it was just *different*. I didn't really care about the feelings and stuff, I just experienced it if that makes sense.

I would ask God for a book of firsts. All the firsts in the universe. The first time a human said cool beans, and under what circumstances. What went through that human's mind. The first time a human ate a tomato. The first time two humans fell in honest to God true love, and their lives together 

Obviously now I know some of those answers might not be pleasant. Tomatoes took a long time to cultivate to the fruit I adore to this day. Just because two people are in love doesn't mean they end up together or have a happily ever after.

So they decided to not be a part at all and headed out on their 2hr ride home. My hero of a wife went in to labor WHILE she was arguing with her mom but didn‚Äôt show it until they were out the door so they wouldn‚Äôt stay. 

They‚Äôve told my wife in private that they are sorry for what they did, but haven‚Äôt said a word to me. It was definitely one of those ‚Äúwe have forgiven ourselves‚Äù routines. 

When they come over to see the kid, I usually find something else to do. I don‚Äôt want to drive a wedge between my wife and her parents, but I have no real desire to foster a relationship with people like that.

15116,"You meant ""word-lovers"" in your question.

With that in mind, let's talk about **hyphens**.

------

Suppose that you wanted to describe some idiots who were using tomato sauce as mouthwash. You could write that they were **marinara-gargling** morons. The hyphen between ""marinara"" and ""gargling"" turns the two words into a single adjective, whereas ""marinara gargling morons"" (without a hyphen) would suggest that the marinara itself was gargling the morons in question. For a less esoteric example, consider a **man-eating chicken** getting revenge on a **man eating chicken**.

Hyphens can also be used to form nouns: A child who is nine years old is a **nine-year-old**, for instance, and a person who has questionable oral hygiene habits is a **marinara-gargler**. Conversely, a ""marinara gargler"" would suggest that the marinara itself was a gargler, possibly of morons who keep going swimming in it. It's the difference between a **frog-juggler** ‚Äì someone who juggles frogs ‚Äì and a **frog juggler**, an exceptionally specific circus act.

Now, the trick here is that when you're forming adjectives (like ""marinara-gargling""), you only hyphenate phrases that appear *before* the nouns that they modify. You also don't hyphenate adverbs that end with a Y, like in ""an **excessively strained** series of examples involving marinara.""

There are a few edge cases and tricky situations, but if you keep the above-listed rules in mind, you'll be a hyphen-using word-writer in no time at all.

**TL;DR: A hyphen is the difference between a man eating chicken and a man-eating chicken.**"

15132,"For those not familiar with the lore. The Tau are a small alien empire with little to no understanding of all the crazy deamons and other weird shit in the 40k universe. They have dull souls that don‚Äôt really attract much attention from all the warpy shit going on in the galaxy. Humans have fairly tasty souls, and (unknowingly) influence the trippy hellscape called the warp with their emotions and beliefs. I think after their last attempt to expand their empire, all of their human auxiliaries in the fleet got nommed by demons during travel through the warp. The tau survivors were saved by what they later found out was a ‚Äúgod‚Äù of the greater good. This god was created by the collective belief and emotion of all the humans who believe in ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù under the rule of the tau. This is bad, because the tau philosophy of the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù is secular, and the tau empire doesn‚Äôt really have a good way of explaining that, as well as all the demons that tend to pop up when you get a bunch of humans together. So yeah, it‚Äôs like Soviet Russia took in some allies for workers and soldiers and taught them communism. And now they have to deal with a those allies creating an actual, interventionist, god of communism. As well as a bunch of random demons. Because of this, some of the tau are performing purges on their human populations. "

15188,Yeah and using people who listen to Doctor Phil as an example sounds to me all he knows is tv.
15189,"You're talking around the point here. No one is arguing that it's difficult to take a pregnancy test, and very few would refuse one if a doctor orders it. 

The issue is with the fact that women are not trusted to know their own bodies. If I tell my doctor that I have not had sex in over a year, that's a very clear indication that I'm sure I'm not pregnant. To then tell a woman that a pregnancy test is required ""just in case"" implies that the doctor does not believe what she is saying. Why ask at all? 

Sometimes its even worse than just an implication.  I have been asked ""are you sure? haven't you been to any parties recently?"" and I have been told that I might have more luck ( getting laid) if i lost some weight. Comments like that are completely inappropriate, and I'm  not the only woman who has experienced it. 

This is indicative of the gender bias in healthcare that has been increasingly well documented in recent years. Women are statistically more likely to die from treatable illness than men because they are perceived differently by healthcare professionals. 

The reality if course is that the doctor just wants to be clear of any liability, and that's very fair. But that is something that can be and should be communicated to the patient. Doctors and patients need to cultivate trust with *each other*. The impetus can not be solely on the patient."

But long distance is hard, and we eventually broke up.  Never really stopped thinking about her, and a few years later I rustled up her email address and sent her a message just letting her know that I still thought about her.

Yet then you have the regular muggle world. A world that has harnessed the power of the atom. That could detonate a warhead that would vaporize everything in a 20 mile radius. A muggle world that seems to greatly outnumber the wizard world as well. The wizard world has not changed in hundreds if not thousands of years. And those responsible for understanding the regular world have no fucking clue how the muggles survive day to day without cheating like wizards. It would only be a matter of time till the muggle world starts to figure out the wizard world and would start to learn how to harness the same powers or figure out how to genetically breed wizards and keep them in the dark from the real wizard world."

You're hitting me right in the feels man.  Not to go too much into it, but my mother passed away a few years ago.  She was in her 40's, severely diabetic, and was on dialysis for kidney failure.  She lived alone, and one day, her sugar got high (or low), she got woozy, laid down on her bed, went into a coma, and died.  My sister and I found her, but we had found her like that in the nick of time a few times before, so it was no surprise, but this time she was dead.  I drove myself crazy the first year or two wondering why she didn't call for help, why she didn't try to do something, whether or not she knew she was going to die, or could feel herself slipping away and just let it happen.  A few months ago my sister convinced me that because it had happened so many times before, she couldn't have thought anything of it, or even comprehended the idea of calling for help.  It's not just that you're getting dizzy, you get confused, your brain cannot function.  That line you said just perfectly explains it to me.

The combination of high city population, limited opportunities, and the one child policy created a variety of social problems. On the one hand, the system created a generation of spoiled children who, in their families eyes, can do no wrong, a problem so common it has its own name: ""[Little Emperor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Emperor_Syndrome)"". On the others, the high population of cities and limited opportunity means there is extreme competition for everything. There is also a misguided belief that helping others will only let them compete with you later, which is why they don't value anyone other than themselves. When you combine the two, you get a generation of people who lack self awareness, believe themselves to be perfect, wants to get ahead at all costs and think the best way to get ahead of others is by putting them down.

When they talk during movies, or cut in line, they don't see what they are doing as wrong. There's nothing wrong with talking during the movie, because they weren't raised with the idea that that is wrong, and you are the idiot who is wasting your time in line, and they are getting ahead of you by skipping the line.

Prior to manned spaceflight, whether or not the human body and mind could actually function while under zero gravity was unknown. There was zero knowledge concerning organisms in zero gravity. So, both the US and Soviet Union shot animals into space instead. Yeah, most of them did not make it back.

The U.S. used monkeys for testing. This was because they could be trained to perform basic tasks such as pulling levers, which could demonstrate to mission control whether or not the test monkey was surviving. Most monkeys either died due to lack of oxygen, overheating, or slammed into the ground at many times the speed of sound. 

The USSR used dogs instead, utilizing relatively the same tests and processes as NASA. Sometimes unfortunately it was planned that the dog was not going to be coming back.

So ultimately, there's no secret *human* fatalities of the space race.

The driver? 75+ year old guy with tubes in his nose. He was partially asleep... "

She didn't really say excuse me or anything, just popped up in the front. Then she said to the cashier, ""I just wanted to order some coffee real quick and that's it."" Luckily, the cashier saw her walk up and said, ""Sorry, there's only this one line, thanks."" and then looked at me to take my order. 

Who did she think she was that she could just walk up to the register and order something 'real quick' while everyone else had already been standing there? 

I know it's not that big of a grievance and I shouldn't really care, but I come across people like that more than I think I should. People who think their day is just slightly more important than everyone else's so they should be able to just cut in front and not have to wait like the rest of us. "

15465,"That‚Äôs so horribly depressing. My husband and I went through a nearly DB situation after our first child was born. It took him sitting me down (I was 26yo) and telling me that he *needed* sex with me to feel connected to me, it‚Äôs how he showed and felt love, and asked what he needed to do to help me fix this. I didn‚Äôt have any *need* for sex, but I wasn‚Äôt opposed to sex. When we would get going I always enjoyed myself. So I decided to have sex every day for a month and see how things went. Well, making myself fuck, made me want to fuck more. By the end of the 30 days I was pouncing on him as soon as he walked in the door. We were fucking all over the house, in the car, outside, wherever we could. I felt like a teenager again. The more I did it, the more I wanted it.  
I‚Äôm 35 now. And we have 3 kids. 2 under 2. Last night my husband found a video we made during an ecstasy fueled night of debauchery when I was 22/23. So he put it on the TV and talked to me about how hot I was and how much hotter I am now (It‚Äôs taken me a long time to feel sexy/hot/pretty, especially after having 3 kids, but I feel more confident today than I did when I was young and all my parts were ‚Äúperky‚Äù) then he went down on me until I came, rimmed me until I came **hard** and then fucked my ass until I came again and again and again then we collapsed on the bed. He woke me up before the kids this morning with a good legs-over-the-shoulders while he was standing by the side of the bed quickie and blew his load on my tits. We‚Äôre making plans to visit a sex club in the near future because I‚Äôve got a little exhibitionist in me that‚Äôs ready to be experimented with.  
  
I guess all this is meant to say, maybe you‚Äôre not doomed. So many couples go through rough patches, but dead-bedrooms for years *can* (and usually do) ruin relationships.

He reportedly made somewhere between 3 to 10 tabs of homemade LSD, stripped naked, downed all the drugs at once, proclaimed his power over god, and wrestled with the MPs for over an hour before he was apprehended and never seen again. A completely reasonable end to this poor man's medical hold.

15557,"But it totally changes the over all message of the film. In the original deleted ending, the scene with the butterfly is *cataclysmic* in terms of revelation, we see they are not mindless monsters, that we can even empathize that *all the vampire wants* is his wife, his family, it mirrors the turmoil Neville was in over the loss of his own family, it completes the butterfly callback through the whole film. We realize in a moment that *Neville* is the bad guy, that his blind drive towards ""fixing"" humanity us causing nothing but horrendous pain to the people who are left, and that he cannot mend what is broken. He must let go of all that he knows, all that he loves, he must become the legend of the new world, they'll tell stories of the  magical boogie man who used to hunt them in the day.

When you cut out that small, 10 minute scene it turns into a ""humanity, fuck yeah!"" moment where humans win and the bad guys lose, where there's still hope and no matter what humans will always be ok. That's not what the movie was gearing up to, and without the reveal we're left with a shitty monster movie instead of a deeper film about how tenuous our trip is on the human hegemony, and how we have no claim to it and may be usurped.

Maybe killing all the bad guys is how humans would react, but Neville realises that every one of the dozens of ""patients"" he's tried to cure and killed was a loved one, someone cared for and cherished, and that makes *him* the monster. No one wants to be a monster. "

I know it sounds obvious, but through myself and a lot of others‚Äô experiences that I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs a tendency to stay in unhappy relationships (even after trying and failing to find a solution) for the sake of not being  alone or routine, etc. 

I spent a lot of time in my first relationship being extremely unhappy with my partner. She was very untrustworthy; cheating, constant lying, manipulative. Our relationship was very damaged and I knew that. I was so scared of being alone, that despite her awful behaviour I swept it under the rug because I didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúdisturb‚Äù my own routine or what I knew so well (comfort), so I just put up and shut up. Don‚Äôt! If you‚Äôve tried to talk things out, and in time you‚Äôre still not noticing any signs of change or improvement... leave. It‚Äôs easier said than done, I know. It took me almost two years of bottling up my anger, sadness, hurt etc. until I‚Äôd had enough and I literally exploded. It started to physically drain me, being so unhappy in my relationship.

Since everyone is on leave he is bored and starts playing cowboy twirling the gun and acting like an idiot.  Of course he accidently fires the gun and thankfully no one was hurt.  

The captain gave him a choice of official punishment (which would essentially end his career) or he could find the spent shell casing that had dropped into the dry dock.  Basically the bottom of dry dock is 2 feet of sludge, seagull crap, and sea water.  After 14 hours down there the captain finally let him shower.

Luckily he didn‚Äôt kill us orherwise i wouldn‚Äôt be writing this haha. Years prior, he stabbed my grandma who also stabbed him smh.

He is sobering up now, to be honest i haven‚Äôt heard from him in years. He was an alcoholic and was addicted to coca√Øne.  I remember he would call my mother often to tell her he killed someone. Which luckily wasn‚Äôt true, at least the police found nothing. Once he called that he killed a taxi driver in Italy, the other time he called that he killed a drugdealer who deliverd coca√Øne at the door because it was powdered sugar. We called the cops then and he threatened to kill us again :(

He once called my dad and said he turned into a werewolf. My dad said it sounded so believable that my mom thought it was real haha. They went to him and called a doctor. He would crawl around the room as if he was a real wolf, broke a bottle with a hamer and threatened to kill the doctor. It‚Äôs so crazy tbh.

His addiction didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. My grandmother was also addicted to alcohol and drugs. She once tried to kill herself and my uncle and mother by turning on the gas and locking them all in the house. My mom was about 10 at the time. She managed to get to the door and she ran to her neighbours, who slapped my grandma across the face to get her back to her senses.

I felt him basically touch the head of his penis to me, then his eyes rolled back in his head and I felt goo all over my legs. He came without getting it in...and he'd snuck of the condom.

The fucking dumbass let his friends convince that unprotected sex would be so much netter without a condom he'd lied to me the entire event and I should have seen it coming with all the ""too young to buy condom bs."" Funny thing is I would have understood the no pump chump thing and let him try again if he hadn't played his game but I was out of there so fast and dumped him via text after a year of dating and finally consenting to having sex with him.

Tip: If any of y'all like the pizza sub, mate do I have a treat for you.

First, pick out what bread you want. (we're usually already reaching for the IH&amp;C at this point)

Second, ask for a pizza sub but with the pepperoni on the top and the salami on the bottom. (or vice versa)

Skip the cheese for now and ask for salads your favourite roastable salad ingredients, such as: capsicum, onion, olives, tomato I suppose, and jalapenos if that floats your boat, to be placed on the sub. Then, pick some cheese to go on top and ask for it to be toasted until the cheese starts to go golden brown.

Then, when the sub comes out of the toaster, pick your other salad ingredients and sauces. When done, walk out with your sub and a smug expression past the line of hungry customers who just saw the whole process and are now drooling from the corners of their mouths."

If I'd have turned it over where there was just a central divider, I'd have almost certainly gone over it into oncoming traffic, and would probably have been facing manslaughter charges, and horrendous injuries.  I got away with a few stitches on my arm, and a written off truck, and lots of DHL packages that were late that day.

Honestly people, don't drive tired.

15809,"My favorite part about working in a seasonal convince store this year, was dealing with customers like this. The owners moved the store to a smaller building, closer to the water. As such they removed serving hard ice cream, and put signs all over the resort stating where the new store was and that we no longer serve ice cream.

Even another company has a sign right be for you enter the resort, telling you there is no ice cream available after that point. The only way you could miss these signs, is if you were blind or not paying attention, which will means you would have drove right off the cliff into the lake...

Nope, get asked all the time or told that I'm *supposed to be serving proper ice cream*, by every 40 something mom. Telling me that I should know this and they have been coming to this lake for X amount of years, there was always ice cream, blah, blah, blah.

They are almost as bad as the city slicker tourists that ask me for the resort's (nonexistent) Wi-Fi password and if the store has a washroom... We don't have a washroom, there is a outhouse across the parking lot, both employees and the public is free to use.

I had one hooligan claim that since I was running the store, I automatically was the ""boss"" and had to give him a refund on a fishing boat he rented from us, because he thought he didn't get his discount (he did, it was applied to his receipt and shown that it was applied to the total). This is the first time I have worked at the resort. I wasn't allowed to do refunds.

I told him repeatedly that I am not authorized to give refunds, and that he would have to call the owners or (supervisor's name), in the morning to discuss any issues he had with his bill. Nope, since I was preset in the store, I was the ""owner"" of the resort and he was going to sue me over a $35 discount he already received...

So as the ""owner"" (after I had called the real owner and my boss about it) I told that punk and his buddies to get the fuck out of ""my store"" before I called someone to remove them for me and charged them for the extra hour they forced me to keep the store open (which was $13)."

15822,"Eugene (Fake name obviously) was fucking a bizarre case.

When I moved to my new high school I was fucking terrified I was going to be bullied since I went to primary school with some of the kids there, and they weren't really nice to me back then, so I latched myself to the first person that was nice to me. Who was Eugene.

Kid was one hell of a weird kid, lied about the dumbest shit and tried to be cool. Lies include being one of the PS4 hackers back in the day, cousins with TheSyndicateProject, using 34 proxies to get into Area 51, being able to solve Rubik's Cubes since he was 3 (except he would always pussy out when I asked to race him), that sorta shit. Pretty harmless, but this trend kept growing.

He was on a quest to get laid. Being a kid during puberty, this isn't something different. But the only fucking thing he would talk about was his plans on HOW to get laid. Some were fucking stupid like befriending the new foreign kid to whoo the girls with his accent then swooping in himself or buying a girl a fuck tonne of roses on HIS birthday to ask her out and she CANNOT say no because it's his birthday.

So these are minor things, but the weird things began when we were sixteen (by this point I've told him to fuck off, actually, I told him two or three months when I first arrived). We had an essay in English that we could write about anything we liked we just had to convince the teacher on our point of view. He wrote on how it was unfair he was labeled as a pedophile when he wanted to fuck thirteen year olds when the true naming of the word was hebophile. Which is fucking weird, but the weirdest thing was when he, for some reason, told me his plan on how to keep being a hebophile. His plan was to fail Year 11 (Junior Year), repeat it at another school, pass, move to another school for Year 12 (Senior year), fail that, move to another school and then graduate.

How he planned to fail school this year was simple. He'd do a charity stunt that would take him six months to do and thus be forcing him to repeat the year. He planned to do a walk across the country to raise money for suicide prevention. Good cause, he got thousands of dollars in donations to get equipment and to go towards the charity. Before he set off he threw a party to try to get laid (Some things never change) then set off on his merry way. Two or so weeks in everyone at school was having a discussion of if he was going to make it or if he was faking it. Eventually, one math teacher got so fed up with the discussion and got the whole class to solve it once and for all mathematically with their class(The average walking speed of a person, times the course of eight~ hours walking, multiplied by the days that have passed). Turns out he was ahead of his schedule, WAY TO FAR AHEAD. I'm not saying he faked walking the distance, but fuck it seemed like it.

At the end of that year Eugene left to go to another school and I thought I'd never hear from him again. But I made a new friend a couple of years down the line someone who shared a hotel with the kid during a school camp. Since Eugene was older then them all, he could buy alcohol for them all to get drunk with. So one night they all got smashed in their hotel room and Eugene said something that's absolutely fucked.

All the money that was donated to him for the charity? The one about suicide prevention? Yeah, turns out Eugene never donated the money and kept it for himself.

Take this with a grain of salt, I wasn't next to Eugene when he did some of these things. But still, fuck Eugene."

Sometime around 2006-2008ish we had a Christmas party at church and there was a little nativity being played out by mostly kids and a few adults, and we took pictures. When we got home to look through the pictures probably close to half of them had what HAD to be ghosts in them. Bright bluish-white translucent robed figures in them. We burned em onto some CD-Rs (oh those were the days) and kept em safe in our ""all the CDs"" bookshelf. But a few years later (and several times since) when we remember the pictures and try to find those disks they're nowhere to be found.

I'm still sad about it.

Called the ambulance at 11:50am, pillow under her head, bedcover over her, door open, gate open, then I got a pillow for myself and we sat together on the floor for THREE HOURS waiting for the ambulance.                    
Wa talked for 3 hours about how she ended up on the floor, then about how my day had been, then she talked to me about things, about how she met her husband and how she spent every weekend at his mothers house. The happiest day of his life when they married. How nice he was to her on sundays when he would make breakfast for them both, how much she loved her sons and how happy she was that they both found wives that made them happy.

15925,"Yes. That's the important second piece. Your emotions are valid and based in reality, BUT that doesn't mean that they ARE reality. 

The fact that you're angry doesn't necessarily mean that someone wronged you and needs to be punished. It could mean that something completely normal set off your anger because of past hurt or some unhealthy way of thinking or something completely unrelated. So your anger is not the other person's problem.

But not understanding that emotions are real can sometimes lead people to act on them unhealthily because they're trying to find a justification for the way that they're feeling (""I must be angry because of what this person did, so yelling at this person will help"").

I find that this list of [cognitive distortions](https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/) is a really good way of making that distinction. We can't get caught up in ""shoulds"" (""I shouldn't feel this way""), but we also can't assume that emotions directly reflect reality (""I feel this way, so it must be this person's fault"")."

I don't know about the US, but in the UK, any dentist treating with Midazolam sedation must now have a second person in the room at all times, as defence against such accusations.

I: ""hi, could you please tell me what stop I have to get of to get to this hotel?""

He: ""sure, that's 'bus station', the first one in the city.""

I: ""okay, great. But what's it called?""

He: ""bus station.""

I: ""Yes, I get it's a bus station, but doesn't it have a name?""

He: ""... bus station.""

He looks at me like I'm retarded and I started to feel uncomfortable. To avoid eye-contact, I looked past him at the luggage compartment of the bus and spotted several labelled sections that read: 'Lufthavn' 'Busstasjon' etc.

15998,"The worst part is that we're already paying for these costs, many of which will go away with universal healthcare. If you're too poor for insurance, you're not going to a primary care physician. You're waiting until your cold becomes the flu becomes pneumonia with a collapsed lung. You're waiting until the cut becomes infected becomes septic. Then, instead of going to your local doctor, you're going to the ER, not paying it back (because who can afford that?), and that cost gets shunted into what the rest of us pay (in premiums and copays).

With universal healthcare, yes, the cost is shunted into what the rest of us pay (in taxes). That's already how it is.

Hitler and the Liberals do not know who anybody is, the Nazis know who they are and who Hitler is. 

Each turn there is a president, this rotates around the table clockwise. Each turn the president chooses the Chancellor. Everyone votes on whether or not that person can be Chancellor, and if they say no then President passes to the next person. 

Each turn the Chancellor draws three 'policies,' hands two to the president, and the president chooses one to enact. If there are three presidents in a row that have been blocked by the vote, then whatever policy is on top of the deck is immediately enacted.

The goal of the game is to either: Enact six Facist policies or enact three fascist policies and make Hitler the Chancellor if you're Fascist, or enact five liberal policies or Kill Hitler if you're liberal. 

As you enact fascist policies, you get special powers as the president, like looking at other people's party cards, vetoing the set of cards that someone gives you, picking the next president out of order, and killing players.

At the company where we were consulting, you needed to dial 9 on their phones to get an outside line. When you used the laptop at home, you would eliminate that in the modem application.

You also could set a code for the phone to disable call waiting so your computer session wouldn‚Äôt get interrupted by someone calling in on the line you were using for the computer. I think it was 1170. See where this is going?

I brought the laptop home and had hooked the modem into my home phone line and started the dialup process. I had not set the 9 to a blank in the modem application. The modem ‚Äúdials‚Äù 911 plus other numbers. I hear the 911 operator come on the line so I immediately pull the RJ11 cord out of the laptop.

16093,"The obvious answer would be a resounding: it won‚Äôt work the way we expect it to. There‚Äôs actually A LOT of reasons. First- I don‚Äôt think our system now is perfect. But this is why I don‚Äôt think universal care is an acceptable solution. 

Insurance and paying different premiums for insurance actually helps provide tiers of care. This might sound bad, because we expect ‚Äústandardized care‚Äù, but the dude getting a heart transplant should get a better level of care than someone whose only issue is a cold once a year. It breeds competitiveness in terms of being a doctor, nurse, surgeon- or any form of health care provider. It aids in pushing hospitals to skim for the cream of the crop and developing and implementing cutting edge technologies. You know how the DMV still has CRT monitors? That‚Äôs fine and they work, but you don‚Äôt want government cuts and subsidies affecting where grandma gets her hip replaced. 

There are people who require an incredible amount of care through their lives- and they‚Äôre entitled to do so. We‚Äôre getting dangerously close to scenarios that happen in Europe where care was denied to certain individuals on the basis that *certain doctors* felt a certain way. While, after medical review, foriegn doctors felt there were viable treatment options. That‚Äôs bad politics, bad principals, and absolutely goes against the whole ‚Äúlife, liberty and pursuit of happiness‚Äù deal each citizen is entitled to. You *do. not. want the government deciding which patients should be left to die.* 

Now, if it‚Äôs not a life or death circumstance, some people need preventative maintenance. Scans, infusions, etc. to keep them up and alive. If everyone is paying the same amount of money, then sally good health is paying for Benji‚Äôs dialysis. Which, theoretically is lovely and well and good. I would relish living in a world where the healthy take care of the sick. 

But the US has a lot of issues in terms of public health. We have an obesity epidemic, opioid addictions, etc. these aren‚Äôt things we should be forcing our neighbor to pay for. Public perception needs to change. It‚Äôs not rational to ask me to pay for Mike‚Äôs quadruple bypass because he can‚Äôt resist McDonald‚Äôs for lunch and dinner. Does that make me an ass? Sure. Do I think he deserves the best care he can muster? Absolutely. Should I pay for it? I don‚Äôt think so. 

There‚Äôs a difference between being born with a handicap and eating yourself into one. And I don‚Äôt think the amount of healthy people could offset a country where the majority of people die of obesity related heart disease. If Benji were unique, sure. But that‚Äôs the majority. And it underscores time, resources and money away from patients who need care. "

It‚Äôs totally normal to project motives onto other people, and to imagine their internal emotional state, but as humans we‚Äôre actually pretty inaccurate at doing both. While we can do a bit better with those we know well/are close with, this is outstripped by our overconfidence in our perceptive ability with these individuals. Basically, when it comes to family and friend we tend to be pretty sure we know how to read their affect/behavior, even though we‚Äôre pretty bad at doing so!

What this means is that no matter how long you‚Äôve known someone, open communication is going to be important. That little bit of vulnerability is going to go a long way in making sure others know how you‚Äôre feeling, so that they can meet your needs. Similarly, directly asking people what they‚Äôre experiencing, as opposed to guessing, can sometimes help you to figure out the best course of action. I can‚Äôt begin to count how many times I sat down with families, only for them to realize they had all made mistaken assumptions about what the other members were thinking and feeling!"

16191,"She went to a community college that was close to the university in order to improve her grades and extracurriculars in the hopes that she would qualify for scholarships down the line.

The Oh Henry irony of it all is that her mom lied to keep her in her hometown, my friend moved anyhow, and then after 2 years of eeking it out and working her ass off, she found out she didn't have to go through all of the sleepless, exhaustive bullshit and could've been living on campus for free in a dorm with a meal plan. Instead, she spent 2 years as an apartment slave sleeping on the floor in a tiny closet for people that let her stay for free. She was working nights at a gas station, eating hot dogs she was supposed to throw away in the back room because it didn't have cameras, taking 21 hours a semester and both summer courses, volunteering and participating in CC extracurriculars, living out of a backpack that she repacked every day on the floor of a shitty apartment. She couldn't even leave her toothbrush in the bathroom. 

Her mom knew about it and figured my friend would just break eventually, so she ignored my friend's cries for help and frustration, instead encouraging her to come back home. When my friend finally applied for scholarships at U of A again, after she had an associate's degree and all this extra work she'd done to add to her application, they called and told her that she'd already been awarded the scholarship and hadn't taken advantage of it 2 years prior, and they wanted to know why her essay stated that she didn't hear back when they'd sent her award letters already, 2 years prior. Initially, they didn't take her application seriously the second time and nearly rejected it.

When she confronted her mom (by driving 3 hours to confront her in person), the response was ""Yeah? So? You weren't ready. A mother knows"" blah blah blah. That was the last time she spoke to or saw her mom. "

16193,"I had a diagnostic surgery last year after almost a decade of unbearable menstrual pain, which my doctors and I suspected was endometriosis. All of my symptoms matched. I had an ultrasound and a 5-6 cm ovarian cyst was found so the surgery was also to remove that. Once my obgyn/surgeon knew I had a cyst she wrote off the possibility of endometriosis, even though my symptoms started when I was 13 (I was 24 at the time).

After surgery I was told I didn't have endometriosis and a cyst was removed from my left ovary. I was exhausted, out of it, and devastated to think my pain was something even harder to diagnose, but I thought the cyst was supposed to have been on the right ovary. I didn't get a chance to speak to my surgeon until a month later because she was on vacation. 

When my follow up finally happened, she confirmed no endometriosis right off the bat. Alright, but I thought my cyst was on the right ovary, not the left. She started explaining that it's sometimes hard to tell which ovary is which while she goes through notes. ""OH the cyst on the ultrasound was MUCH larger than the one we removed, the other one must have burst... also you do have endometriosis."" Then she told me that was the end of the appointment and left the room. 

She retired shortly after and I have a much better doctor now, thank god. "

16262,"Had a similar experience but I never ""died"". I was hit by a drunk driver while crossing the road. I saw it happen from the corner even though my body was crossing the street. I was held in place by a tall guy and a kid. The guy put his hand on my shoulder and held me there.  He was standing behind me.  Woke up in my body before passing out when the ambulance came. I described the guy and kid to my mom. She says I nailed descriptions of her cousin and brother. Her brother died when he was 2, long before I was born. The cousin also died before I was born. I never saw pictures of them. I was 8 at the time. "

16266,"If everyone likes you, you are doing something wrong.

In order to get everyone to like you, you have to please everyone. In order to please everyone, you need to sacrifice your own personality and growth for everyone.

If you change for yourself instead of other people, and build your personality naturally, if you *affirm* in yourself, there will be people who don't like certain aspects of you. And that is okay.

Another piece of advice, if everywhere you walk smells like shit, look under your shoe. Once you have established yourself, don't get caught up into getting everyone to dislike you. You are growing, but not in a healthy way. You will become unhappy as a result. Take cues from other people and try to identify parts of you that are toxic, and mitigate them or remove them entirely. Not for anyone, for yourself. So you can be happy with who you are.

But regardless, take pride in your foundation, the 'you' that you built. For all its perfections and flaws, it's special and it's yours."

Hotel management eventually said ok time to ""evict him.""  When they opened the door they froze in shock shock as this man ran past them in a diaper and left the building. When they searched his room it was full of dirty adult diapers, take out food containers, and all different kind of drugs everywhere. The hotel called the cops since it was a crime scene at that point and a special machine had to be used to repurify the room and get rid of the stench. The man appeared to ride a 2 month drug binge without ever leaving his hotel room and clearly knew what to do by all the diapers he had on hand so I wonder if this was a common pattern for him. "

For instance, I had this guy who would come into my office because he knew I had candy in my drawer. He would come in and tell me some outlandish story about having a sea shell on his heart and get all animated because he knew it would get a rise out of me, and because he knew it would probably increase his chances of getting a piece of candy.

I've never experienced such a huge diversity in teaching skills than during my bachelors. I've had teachers in core classes with zero didactic skills, that rambled off their explanations in a monotone voice while staring at a spot on the floor in front of the first row of tables or would take any and every question as an opportunity to launch into endless tangents of minimal significance. Professors who would take whole lessons to try and come to a point only for their assistants take the students aside during lab time and explain the same thing in 5 minutes.

On the other hand I've had a teacher who was so meticulous about his lessons that I'm convinced he has some kind of OCD or falls somewhere on the Aspergers spectrum. He was brilliant and whenever he said ""you all should be about finished now"" two things would be happening: you actually were just about finished with your work and the bell would ring 10 seconds later. Another one was one of the few non technical teachers at the school, teaching an optional final year course in social psychology. I don't think there were more than a handful of students who didn't take his course or regretted taking it."

16486,"Let me toss out that the woods behind my parents house is full of random graves and one murdered woman.  You can seriously creep yourself out when you're at their house and without going into the long, drawn-out story about it lets just say nobody but us can stand to be there.

So way back in my teenage days my parents went out of town, leaving me there to house sit.  We hadn't lived there long so the occupants of the woods were still somewhat creepy to me.  

The first thing I did was hook up my playstation to the big TV in the living room. (which I was forbidden to do)  It's a nice night so I opened the windows (also forbidden)  I'm happily sitting in the window, enjoying the breeze and playing games.

I chose to play Resident Evil that night.  A poor choice in hindsight as I was borderline scared to be there alone anyway.  

I'd been playing a few hours and I was all good and wound up from the jump scares.  Then I got to the part where that thing comes in from the garden after you.  The scariest thing I'd ever encountered in a video game.  That coupled with the woods chock full of potential zombies and I'm hanging on by a thread.

I'm clutching that controller so hard at this point my hands are hurting.  Then, all of a sudden, right next to my head I hear this chilling, low-pitched ""UURRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH"" come through the window right in my ear.  I snapped and flipped my shit.  Careening through the kitchen screaming, I plow out the back door, half fall down the back steps gibbering in panic, and skid down the driveway.  I run smack into the neighbor, a cop, who had been asked to keep an eye on me by my dad.  He heard me flipping out and came rushing over all locked and loaded.

I am scared out of my mind and I gabble out...something...at him and point him towards the windows where I was sitting.  He goes into cop mode and goes off in that direction.  Where I hear him burst into laughter.

It was a goddamn chicken on my front porch.

16518,"During the early 80s, I was 9 and my family moved from Utah to the Midwest. After arriving, I had a hard time making friends. I was too na√Øve, too geeky, and just didn't ""fit in"" with kids outside of the ""Zion curtain"" (i.e. Mormon-run Utah). My only friends were other goofy Mormons - good kids, but we made the kids from Stranger Things look like hard-asses. To make things worse, I was a shitty Mormon (and luckily haven't been one for a long time). I liked comic books, D&amp;D and other things ""forbidden,"" so I even felt a bit like an outcast among my ""group."" I was desperate to have cool friends and a girlfriend.

Eventually, I worked my way to the fringe of the¬† ""cool kids."" They swore, some smoked, had access to their dad's porn - and talked to girls. I¬† was on the rise. In fact, I even got on ""safety patrol,"" where I would stand on the corners of our street down from the school with the ""cool kids"" and make sure kids didn't cross the street when they shouldn't.

One day, a goofier-than-me boy moved in. We'll call him Billy. Billy was odd, hyperactive and just really hard for my popularity-striving, elementary mind to comprehend. He would smile widely and say things ""Yoo kwazy!"" over and over again. Eventually, I called him Daktari (I don't know why) and that moniker became his new name.

One day, just before school let out, the safety patrol assumed our positions. The bell rang, kids left, and we were just getiy ready to go home when Daktari came walking down the street. The ""cool kids"" started telling at him, calling him names, saying hurtful things - the usual. They egged me on and I joined in. 

Then, someone picked up a clod of dirt and nailed him in the stomach. Soon, a barrage of dirt clods pinned him to the ground. Facedown, on his knees, hands covering his ears and eyes, he cried and pleaded for us to stop as we¬† relentlessly pelted him with dirtclods. For a while, I was caught up in the moment. I was ""one of the THEM - the cool kids,"" and he was the ""other"" - the me I used to be. And then it hit me. I felt sick to my stomach and dropped my dirtclod. An adult came out of their house and scared us off, but they didn't help Daktari. 

A day or so later, I saw Billy walking up my street. It turned out he only lived a few houses down from me. I ignored him, be he kept an eye on me. The day after that, we had PE, and Billy was in my class. We ran out drills, played whatever game we were supposed to play and then went in the locker room to change.

As Billy took off his shirt, I saw the round purple bruises from the dirtclods, but they paled in comparison to the blackened-blue stripes from his father's belt. In my mind, I think Billy went home and told his parents what happened and his dad beat him up for letting it happen. That's the kind of ""man"" he was.

I went to the Asst. Principal and told her what I saw, and what we did on safety patrol. Nothing happened to us apart from detention, but a few days later - maybe a week or so, I realised I stopped seeing Billy around. I walked down to the house his family rented and it was empty. I assume the school contacted his dad, or the police did, and he left town with the family in tow.

From that point on, I decided I would never bully anyone again, and if I saw someone being bullied, I'd stick up for them. I fell from grace, got bullied, got beat-up, and learned a lot about compassion for others. BUT, Billy paid the price for my education, and thats something I'll never forget."

16525,"Factory I used to work in they beat it into your head to never reach into a running machine, and stated if you were caught doing so, you were out the door.  
Well, one dingus somehow got promoted to ""operator"", meaning they did setup/etc.  About a week later, he stuck his hand in a running machine, it nearly ripped his pinkie finger completely off.  
Instead of firing him, they laid the blame on the other operators for ""*not training him well enough*""."
16526,"Oh this reminds me. I used to work phone support for a company that makes computer components like GPUs and Mobos. Guy comes in for his second day, has received a bit of training on his first day and sat next to someone taking calls to listen, now he's about to start taking his first calls and they have me sit next to him to listen and support him if he needs it since I've been there a bit over half a year and generally know what's up now.


I sit down and immediately I notice something is up.  The guy has clearly got the giggles. I'm kind of dense so it took me a bit to realize what was happening and I never smelled anything on his breath but my sense of smell has always been not very sensitive.  I let my supervisor know and he tells me ""Well maybe he's nervous just have him do one and see how it goes."" I say ok and go sit back down. We have to log into the phone with eight zeros as the password, and this dude cannot count to eight. He keeps typing in the wrong number of zeros and he knocks the phone off the hook accidentally while trying. This kid is fucked up. I cannot let this person talk to customers. I go back to my supervisor and let him know I am 90% certain he is high or drunk. Sup used to be a bouncer so he just has the guy sit next to him and talks to him a bit under the guise of some more training. He smells his breath and observes the same behavior I did and he agrees this kid is drunk. 


Might have ended there with a firing... but it did not... So my supervisor explains to me that he can't just send him home now, because that's a liability if we fire this guy while he's drunk and he drives home and gets in an accident we could catch trouble for it. So we tell the guy to sit at the front of our room where we have some test PCs set up with different hardware and to just relax there and ""familiarize himself with the products"". Guy is too drunk to realize we know exactly how drunk he is.  He sits down up front, moves one GPU from one computer to another, and falls asleep sitting in the chair. Finally a bit of peace and we get some work done. 


Dude wakes up and goes to the kitchen to refill his water bottle. I go into the kitchen a bit after to get some water and there is a big puddle of water on the ground like someone had dropped a full water bottle on the ground and then just left the spill. We work the night shift so only the phone staff is in the building right now plus a few managers. So I start cleaning the puddle because whatever no one else is around to do it. I look up after working for a minute or so and the big boss manager is standing in the door. He asks what happened, I let him know looks like someone spilled and I'm cleaning it up, he says thanks. Drunk dude is now standing in the doorway next to the big manager and I shit you not he says to me ""oh wow what did you do?"" and chuckles. I don't know how self aware he was at this point so I'm not sure if he knew that I knew he'd spilled and was trying to play it off with some humor, or if he really was so stupidly drunk that he thought I didn't know his dumbass was the one who made the mess I was currently on my knees cleaning.  I wasn't sure if big manager was aware of the situation or not so I just said nothing and finished cleaning.


The night shift goes on, his shift is getting closer to being over since it was a shorter training shift anyway, and soon we will not be responsible for him anymore and he's going to be told to not come back when he leaves. As far as I can tell this entire time he thinks his shift is going great. He gives zero indication that he can tell we all know he's been shitfaced the whole night. He goes to the bathroom, another break from babysitting this idiot, nice. An hour passes. He is still in the bathroom. A second hour passes. He is still in the bathroom and he will not respond to us pounding on the door. It's a single person bathroom so the door has a push lock on it, we don't have a key. He groans from time to time but he will not wake up to open the door for us. We have to call the handyman that they use for the building to come get the door open. While the handy man is working, this dude's mom has arrived to pick him up after his shift. She is now waiting out front asking us where he is. He's locked in the bathroom passed out because he was shitfaced at work. We don't tell her this, we just let her know he's in the bathroom and we'll send him out. 


Finally the door gets opened, and we literally have to push his body out of the way on the floor to get the door open because he's just out on the tile. We manage to wake him up, get him to splash some water on his face, and send him out the front door to his mom while I assume his head is exploding from the hangover that had to have started by then. He leaves with his mom, they call him the next day and tell him not to come back.


He asked why not."

16536,I don't have a low libido but my wife's isn't as high as mine. Usually back rubs and body rubs helps her relax and 5 times out of 10 it helps her get in the mood. But other than that all you can do is talk and come up with a schedule or routine that can work. Even though my wife isn't as horny as me we still manage sex at least once a week and we have been together for 6 years. 
16537,"Thats fucked up.



Here, we get a year paid. I decided to stay home with my first as daycare is insane. I went back to work before my 2nd and cried like a baby everyday because i was worried my 1.5 year old would stop loving me cause i was gone. I left work at about 14 weeks pregnant because i was high risk, got medical leave and maternity - so i was paid i think 57 weeks total for the 2 through EI.


Ive pretty much been a stay at home mom for the better part of 6 years. Im starting school in september and its killing me that my 3 year old will be without me for a few hours everyday (staying with dad and grandma).


I cant imagine having to leave my *newborn* and go back to work. 



Im so grateful that i didnt have to and it hurts me that some people dont even have a choice. "

16618,"&gt; Being able to take care of yourself is manly.

That's the line right there. I've only jokingly had a couple guys at work give me minor shit for cooking the most at home, but besides the fact of ""fuck it I like to"" is ""Grown up shit man."" There is nothing manly about a 36 year old guy who can't cook a basic decent meal for himself or his family. That's just more sad really. There are certain things you should just be able to do by a certain age.

16685,"No, MDMA releases both dopamine and serotonin so it does force you to be happy. LSD which only binds to some serotonin receptors but is not actual serotonin is more of an emotion amplifier.  

Edit: Here's some actual research on the subject.

The primary mode of action of MDMA is as an indirect serotonergic agonist, increasing the amount of serotonin released into the synapse (Kalant, 2001). MDMA acts on the serotonin transporter and is transported into the nerve terminal. This promotes release of serotonin through the serotonin transporter by a process of transporter-mediated exchange. Whilst within the terminal, MDMA interferes with the storage of serotonin within the vesicles and thus increases the amount of serotonin available to be released (Rothman &amp; Baumann, 2002). This process can lead to significant increases in serotonin available in the synapse.

MDMA is also able to enhance release of dopamine (Gold, Hubner &amp; Koob, 1989; Lyles &amp; Cadet, 2003) and noradrenaline (Frei, Gamma, Pascual-Marqui, Lehmann et al., 2001). It is presumed that MDMA's effects on dopamine and noradrenaline release are mediated in a similar manner to the serotonin release. MDMA can also inhibit monoamine reuptake and delay metabolism by inhibition of monoamine oxidase (Leonardi &amp; Azmitia, 1994).

In addition to increasing extracellular levels of monoamines (Kalant, 2001), there is some evidence to suggest that MDMA might also have a range of other receptor effects, acting on 5HT2 receptors, a2-adrenergic receptors and M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors (Battaglia, Brooks, Kulsakdinun &amp; De Souza, 1988; McDaid &amp; Docherty, 2001). It has relatively low affinity for D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (Battaglia et al., 1988).

My guess is that the serge of  noradrenaline with the combination of serotonin can maybe produce panic attacks as the brain is a bit overwhelmed but it definitely is setup in such a way to produce euphoric feelings in most people as it acts primarily on our reward system. The feeling of closeness, elevated social ability and euphoria are kinda forced on you by the drug, one of the reasons it is used in therapy is because of its euphoric effects. LSD which does not produce serotonin or dopamine is easier to bad trip on and does not force you to like everything around you. I sincerely believe that forced euphoria is one of the best describers of an MDMA trip.

It appears that MDMA works by shifting the user‚Äôs attention towards positive experiences while minimizing the impact of negative feelings. To investigate this, a 2012 study by Cedric Hysek and colleagues used the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), which was developed to evaluate people with autism. In the RMET, participants are shown 36 pictures of the eye region of faces. Their task is to describe what the person in the picture is feeling.

Volunteers taking MDMA, under carefully controlled conditions, improved in their recognition of positive emotions; but their performance in recognizing negative emotions declined. In other words, they incorrectly attributed positive or neutral feelings to images that were actually negative in emotional tone. They mistook negative and threat-related images for friendly ones.

Two 2014 studies have borne this out. Kirkpatrick and colleagues used the Morphed Facial Expression Task (mFER), which uses standardized faces, morphed in 10 percent increments from neutral to emotional. The authors found that MDMA reduced the subjects‚Äô accuracy in identifying angry and fearful faces but did not affect identification of happy faces, leading them to conclude that ‚ÄúThe drug‚Äôs prosocial behavioral effects might be partially explained by a decreased capacity to perceive negative emotional states in others.‚Äù

The second study focused on social rejection, using a game called ‚ÄúCyberball,‚Äù which was developed as a model for ostracism. In Cyberball, participants play virtual catch with two computer-simulated characters who can either toss the ball to the subject or to each other. If the subject receives more throws, he is meant to feel accepted. The fewer throws he receives, the more rejected he feels. Frye and colleagues hypothesized that rejection during Cyberball would have a negative impact on mood, while pretreatment with MDMA would reduce this effect.

The researchers found that MDMA users rated themselves highly both on ‚Äúfeeling high‚Äù in general and on feeling ‚Äúloving‚Äù in particular. Subjects on MDMA accurately perceived acceptance in the Cyberball game, but they were much less bothered by rejection; in fact, rejected MDMA users believed they had received many more throws than they actually had. Like the authors of the previous study, these researchers concluded that MDMA‚Äôs prosocial effects are less based on positive bias than they are on impaired recognition of rejection. The user feels more positive and ‚Äúloving‚Äù because she can‚Äôt accurately process hostility.

Supporting these studies are functional MRI experiments demonstrating that MDMA activates the ventral striatum, a structure involved in reward expectation, while decreasing the response to angry faces in the amygdala, which processes frightening stimuli.

How do neuroscientists explain these effects? Many different neurotransmitters have been invoked. MDMA‚Äôs effects on serotonin, a key player in all hallucinogenic drugs, accounts for its users‚Äô increased sensitivity to music and appreciation of light shows, reflecting the drug‚Äôs popularity at raves. Its stimulation of norepinephrine and dopamine release may explain the euphoria and increased energy users experience, and increased cortisol levels are implicated in decreasing fatigue. The prosocial effects‚Äîthe desire to socialize and bond with others‚Äî have been linked, though controversially, to MDMA‚Äôs effects on brain concentrations of the hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hormone known to be important for human mating and bonding. Oxytocin release during breast-feeding is thought to strengthen the bond between mother and infant. Animal studies show that oxytocin administration in rats increases ‚Äúadjacent lying‚Äù‚Äîie, cuddling.

Another study by Kirkpatrick‚Äôs group looked at the effect of MDMA on oxytocin levels. They believed that MDMA would increase blood levels of oxytocin. Participants took different doses of MDMA and on other occasions, different doses of intranasal oxytocin. As expected, both inhaled oxytocin and MDMA increased blood oxytocin levels in a dose-dependent manner‚Äîmeaning that the more of each substance ingested, the more oxytocin was found in the blood. While the researchers found that MDMA did indeed increase oxytocin levels, they showed that oxytocin alone‚Äîgiven in its inhaled formulation, without MDMA‚Äîdid not produce prosocial effects. MDMA users rated themselves highly as ‚Äúplayful‚Äù, ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù, and ‚Äúloving‚Äù, while the oxytocin group did not. While oxytocin‚Äôs role in mammalian social interaction is undisputed, the above study, and other recent work, casts doubt on the role that increases in oxytocin levels have to do with Molly‚Äôs popularity as a party drug.

Who is Albert Fish? He was known as the Gray Man. The Werewolf of Wisteria. You know why he was known as the gray man? Because when they- (he was a serial killer. He slayed children and ate them, he was a cannibal) when police asked a woman to describe him she said: ‚Äúhe was gray in both appearances and demeanor‚Äù. Very bad description for the police to go by. 

But anyways, he was a child rapist and cannibal as I was saying: Fish boasted that he had children in every state. Now I would not boast about that and I don‚Äôt think that you would. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd do it, but if you did do it you certainly wouldn‚Äôt boast about it. You‚Äôd take it to the grave with you. but he boasted. 

But this is interesting: Fish chose victims that were either mentally handicapped or African American. Why do you think he did that? What would be the explanation? Why would the victims that he chose only be either mentally handicapped or African American? You‚Äôre exactly right. You‚Äôre thinking like Albert Fish now! Nobody really cared about them.

Fish tortured, mutilated, and murdered the youngsters (they were children) with a meat cleaver, a butcher knife, and a small handsaw. He solidified his reputation as the most vicious child slayer in criminal history: though barely literate, Fish wrote taunting letters to the parents of his victims, gruesomely detailing how he slayed, butchered, cooked, and then with great enjoyment dined on their offspring. He would inevitably declare that a child‚Äôs roasted rump was the most toothsome dish in all of gastronomy. 

Additionally, Fish was a masochist ‚Äì get this ‚Äì and he would insert wool doused with lighter fluid into his own anus and set it alight for his own enjoyment. Fish was finally arrested and he immediately began confessing to killing seven hundred children, and he was dizzyingly happy about it. He smiled as he described the grizzly details of the tortures and the murders, and one of the detectives said he ‚Äúappeared as the devil himself‚Äù. 

I mean this albert fish guy, this guy was a real jerk.

I'm just curious what kind of effect having something horrible happen to you before you are able to form memories would have on you psyche.

Now add in a lot of mechanics specifically designed to get player to hate each other, even down to minor stuff like being able to rename your defeated opponent.

And finally, add in a catch up system that instead of helping the last place player get free stuff, it makes them a walking death machine for 14 turns, who can basically kill anyone, try and force people into battles they cannot surrender in, and if they get enough points, literally make every town in the entire global map back under monster control."

My parents got divorced when I was 4. My mom remarried a year later. I have two younger sisters. Throughout my childhood and teenage years, I was the only one in the household who had that old last name. 

My step-dad was the one who raised me not the biological father. The bio-dad was still (occasionally) in the picture so no formal adoption was really in play. When I became of legal age, I went through the court system to change my last name to my step-dad's. He came to court with me for the judgment and it was one of the best moments when, after the ruling, the clerk called out for, ""Mr. Lloyd?"" and it dawned on me that they were calling me...

Yellows are my third choice as 7 being the most likely on two dice puts you squarely there after Free Parking cards. Everything between Go To Jail and Go is just a luck if the roll with it's four non-property spaces, and is usually where I see folks invest themselves into bankruptcy.

However the dual blue knockout pays handsomely when it does work, which is why I think people romanticize the combo. It's a bit like the false hope of winning the lotto. Every so often you score, but there's plenty of folks who lost their shirts being stretched too thin by trying to aim big."

16943,"&gt;It's a decidedly not funny strip, it's depressing even

And that, combined with the way the comic usually is, part of why the joke became what it did. 

*Ctrl+Alt+Del* generally had a casual, attempting-to-be-humorous tone similar to any other mediocre 2000s Two Gamers On A Couch webcomic. At some point, the author decided to add a subplot about the main character's partner getting pregnant. He apparently didn't know how to resolve this plot, though. 

So instead of taking the arc to its conclusion, he abruptly introduced Loss. And then, instead of continuing with the tone introduced in that comic, he mostly went back to ""haha two gamer webcomic"". The jarring tone whiplash and the fact that it seemed to be an excuse to add some drama-for-the-sake-of-drama, while still upholding the status quo, made Loss (and *Ctrl+Alt+Del* as a whole) subject to incredible mockery from people who were likely to read it.

Lots of those people were /v/ users. While they started in order to mock the strip, over time, the jokes got more and more abstract until the image's basic composition, the format of  
| |l  
|| |_  
became a sort of inside joke in and of itself. A calling card for /v/ users, as well as a prank-of-sorts for those who were in on the joke.

The meme leaked into the rest of the internet quite a bit over the years, but in late 2015, the prank form was what hit the big time. The idea being: post an innocuous-looking image with no warning. People will likely get suspicious, since something is *always* up when someone just posts a normal-looking picture out of the blue with no caption or context.  Those who are aware of the meme will then end up feeling aggravated, because they *knew* something was up, and they put a not-insubstantial amount of effort into focusing on that image and finding out that it's just goddamn Loss.jpg again. (It's similar to the less-widespread meme of replying to an image with the same picture, but the You Know I Had To Do It To 'Em guy shopped deep into the background.)

Sidenote: the people that, just in the past few months, have popped up acting like the miscarriage is the point of the joke? They're a bunch of edgelords who never understood what was going on in the first place.

##**tl;dr** *Ctrl+Alt+Del* did drama bad, and Loss turned into a build-anticipation-bad-payoff prank"
16944,"One of my best friends was letting a girl he used to date live with him while she got back on her feet financially speaking. She was becoming more and more of an entitled ass to him and he made a comment about her being a mooch. He was sitting in the floor watching TV, she came up behind him and hit him in the head hard enough to knock him out for a second. Then she got on top of him and started choking him. He was able to get away and walked to the police station, which was smart as they arrest one person when a domestic violence call is put in and it's pretty much always the man, even if they're the victim (my second story is an example of that). The cops came, she hid from them and resisted arrest as well, all of which she was charged with. She went to jail for like, a week. At the hearing she lied to the judge, trying to play the victim and say my friend was abusing her, but thankfully it was obvious to the judge she was full of crap. End result? She basically got time served and probation. Never in a million years would that happen if the sexes had been reversed. My friend was molested by a female teacher of his when he was a kid too.

Another close friend unfortunately knocked up his awful, awful girlfriend (one day he was driving her to work, she was yelling at him, he started to actually defend himself and she said she‚Äôs scream ‚Äúrape‚Äù out the window if he didn‚Äôt stop talking back) and decided to do the whole, I'm going to marry get and make the best of it. He was asleep, she was going through his phone\computer and misinterpreted some email he sent and interpreted it as him cheating (he wasn't, though I truly wouldn‚Äôt have blamed him with how awful a person she was). She went into the bedroom and started punching him. He woke up (obviously) and he had to hold her down to prevent her from attacking him more. She was screaming her head off, neighbors called the police and, guess what? They took him to jail. He lost his job and while in jail she made sure to tell everyone they knew that he had been beating her (again, no). Once he got out, she went to his hearing to basically vouch for him so he wasn‚Äôt charged so she could have that hanging over his head.

I've met more men than just these two that have been victimized by women in the same way. I've met women, and my friends have as well, that have admitted lying to the police about the same stuff to get what they want and get their boyfriends in trouble because they were angry. I've met women that admitted they would do that if they thought a guy ""deserved it"". I've met women, and experienced it myself, that will lie and gossip about an interaction to make them look like a victim. I've been sexually assaulted by women in public more times than I can count on one hand and surrounding people that witnessed it either thought it was funny, silly or no big deal.

The women in my first two stories were awful people and my friends really should have known better and not had them in their lives as it was pretty clear they were awful women, but other women I've known who have done or admitted they would do similar things weren't, at least I thought. This truly isn't an uncommon thing that women do to men based on my experience, my friends‚Äô experiences, and other men that I‚Äôve talked to‚Äôs experiences, and it's mostly ignored because of the current #metoo climate of just believing women without any evidence at all. Obviously actual victims deserve justice and perpetrators deserve punishment. But after having firsthand experience with this, and seeing my friends' and others' experiences, no, I don't believe these stories without some evidence. Even just lying and gossiping about it can ruin a man's life and unfortunately there are enough women out there that know the court of public opinion, as well as the actual courts, will take their side. And, like in my first story, even if it does finally come out that they‚Äôre full of crap, they‚Äôre usually no consequences. It's not even something you can bring up with people to talk about because you're immediately branded sexist."

16946,"Both of my bosses are surgeons and while they‚Äôre wonderful, I‚Äôve met plenty of asshole surgeons and feel like I can speak to why. Most doctors get into the field because they care about people and want to help them, but to get into med school you also have to be in the top 10% or so of ambitious, competitive people. Surgical specialties are the most competitive specialties, so to get into one you have to be in the top 10% among med students. The final 2 years of school, a lot of your grade is subjective evaluations from the doctors you are working with, which can be frustrating trying to get good grades from doctors who may or may not care about you. But let‚Äôs say you get into a surgical specialty like neurosurgery. You now have 7 years ahead of you of 100+ hour work weeks with a salary of $60,000 and all the stress that comes with actually cutting people open. Now you‚Äôre 32, all your college friends are married with kids and taking nice vacations and hanging out with friends on weekends and you‚Äôre half a million dollars in debt with no time for friends or family. So you finally make it through and become an attending, you can finally follow your dream to help people right? Have fun dealing with a healthcare system that is increasingly controlled by insurance companies and for-profit hospitals, where you‚Äôll have 15 minutes to see each patient and 10 minutes of that visit is filling out electronic medical record forms to make the billing and legal departments happy. You‚Äôre finally starting to pay off your debt in your mid thirties, you‚Äôve dealt with 7-11 years of being treated like crap, and now you only get 5-7 minutes to talk to each patient because the hospital is breathing down your neck to increase the number of patients you see, it can unfortunately be pretty easy to become cynical and angry."

16954,"This is incorrect, quantitative psychological research will always have a working hypothesis (i.e. a prediction). This will either be supported or unsupported via statitistacal analysis. sure, psychology isn't a 'hard science', and it doesn't profess to be. However, it does draw up on other sciences, e.g physiology (which is highly related to our behaviour). Also, I think most practicing psychologists aren't concerned with proving whether or not psychology is a science or not, they are concerned with empathy, reflection, listening and using evidence based therapies to help others to overcome emotional struggles and cope with everyday life."

That ""heaven"" is like a ""chord"" or ""whole pool"" made up of everyone as one.

I once spent the night on a friend's couch after a night out and, in the morning, I wanted to go out and grab something to eat.

He wasn't feeling well and asked me to drop into the pharmacy and get him some medicine.

He didn't tell me what was wrong with him. Just gave me the name of the medicine.

So I went in and asked the lady behind the counter. But there were two versions of this medicine and she had questions.

Was the diarrhea painful? Am I bloated? Do I have cramps?

I told her I don't know because it was for a friend.

She rolled her eyes and asked what ""my friend's"" symptoms were.

She literally made the air quotes with her fingers. 

The more I told her that I really don't know because it was actually for a friend, the more frustrated she got.

I eventually just had to bite the bullet and pretend it was for me. I guessed the symptoms and she gave me an exasperated, *""Was that so hard?""*

There must be loads of situations like this.

I just know that, somewhere out there, some guy really did slip after getting out of the shower and landed on something that went up his ass.

And he probably had to just give in and say that he put it up there so that the doctors and nurses would stop rolling their eyes and get it out."

17092,"When I was in high school I was in a program that prepped high school students who had applied for going to China for two weeks. It was the most amazing trip of my life, and I learned so much, and were it not for the sketchy political climate, I'd go back in a heartbeat probably to stay permanently. 

Now, an important part to this story is that when we had received our list of necessities, it had emphasized *comfortable* clothing. My mom, being marginally aware of what she called ""squatty-potties,"" decided that this obviously meant skirts so that I didn't have to worry when I had to use the bathroom out in public. Now, I was a pretty tomboyish girl at the time, the last time I could remember wearing a skirt was in early elementary school. I did have to admit that these skirts were very pretty -- long, flowy, with delicate lacing at the bottom. The point is, I wasn't really aware of how much space a skirt could take up, especially while I was moving, and it never occurred to me that the delicate lace detail was akin to the most inconvenient and inefficient velcro ever. 

When we stopped at this ""little"" town full of 600,000 people, our guides decided that we had been behaving ourselves well enough to be allowed to wander around this one little alleyway of shops right in front of our hotel, as long as we brought a partner. On the way to this alleyway there were a bunch of bikes -- a good mix of motorcycles, bicycles, and scooters, probably at least a good eight or ten of them. As we were walking, I felt a tug and before I could react, several crashes and an alarm behind me. After jumping a mile, I turned and saw that my skirt had gotten caught on the handlebars of one of the scooters, which had started the loudest domino chain. Every single bike had been knocked over, and everyone on the street was now staring at me. A child laughed, and a couple of women pointed.

After picking up the bikes, I quickly tried my best to hide in the alleyway (not the easiest thing to do when you're one of 20 Caucasian teenagers in the heart of a shopping district in China), and promptly purchased a pair of pants."

It's like if someone can't afford to change their oil, only ended up needing to fix a busted engine. However that person cannot afford to pay the mechanic, so the mechanic charges you, the person next inline, extra to cover his losses.

17123,"The older I got, the earlier my curfew became.  By my senior year of high school I had to be home by 9:00 pm.  I was not allowed to go to both a football game AND a school dance because I would have been gone for too long.  I wasn't allowed to have friends over.  I could go over to other friends' houses occasionally, but I really had to work at sucking up for a day or two so my dad would be in the mood to allow it.  I was only allowed to receive one phone call per day, and if he was in a mood, it had to be less than 15 minutes long--if anyone else called for me, I was in deep trouble.  I definitely could not do anything during the week--even staying after school for tutoring was an ordeal.  Other kids stopped inviting me to stuff because I was rarely allowed to go, anyway.  I didn't go to prom, the senior trip, or any of that stuff because it would have gotten ruined somehow (the limo isn't going to make a trip back to my house at 8:00 pm just for me.)  I probably wouldn't have been allowed to go, anyway, so I never asked. 

Today, I consider myself socially awkward in many ways because of this.  I never invite people to my house--I feel strange entertaining people in my home because I never saw my parents do it, and I wasn't allowed to, so it just doesn't feel natural.  I normally wait for people to invite me to do something rather than finding something fun to do and inviting others, and I think it is just because I was conditioned to not be allowed to leave the house; I always waited for a friend to invite me to something and then I decided if it was worth sucking up/begging for.  I am really working on this, but man, that stuff sticks with you.  "

17153,"&gt; Wait you do realize that we just cut the tax base by $1.5 TRILLION dollars and effectively zero of that went to anyone making less than $500K a year right?

This is not true. The standard deduction, which is the deduction most of those in the low to middle class use, was doubled. It went from 6,300 to 12,700. ALso, the child tax credit was doubled, raised form $1,000 to $2000.

This means that, for example, a middle class family with 3 kids and the parents filing jointly will have an additional $12,700 of their income exempt from federal taxes, and get an additional $3,000 back in the form of a child tax credit on top of the $3,000 they were already getting in child tax credits. This equates to thousands of dollars every year. 


Another thing id like to point out is that because the US has a progressive tax system,  there are many people that pay $0.00 in taxes. Many even get  money back in the form of child tax credits even though they pay nothing. The reason why many poor people don't benefit from a tax cut is because they already pay nothing. You can't  cut their taxes if they don't pay any. Zero times anything is still zero!"

The sauce is the hardest part of pasta because pasta only has 2 required parts and well, noodles are only slightly harder to make than toast. But making the sauce is super super easy. You aren't grueling over it and babying it. Only a couple sauces can even be ruined outside of burning it. It's mostly tossing the right ingredient into a sauce pan at the right moment and stirring it. Things like satchels, stock and roux can even be premade days beforehand. 


The stuff in a bag is generally not very good. Cream based sauces for example doesn't keep at all so the premade kind is made with a different type of dairy that doesn't require refrigeration, and it tastes so unlike alfredo even Olive Garden doesn't use it. Tomato sauces though, that stuff keeps great and I find almost no difference between fresh made and from a jar after you season it to the restaurants style.

I‚Äôm 35 and am not going to have kids by choice, not due to any medical condition, and your description is honestly what I would imagine my life being after having kids.

Couples expressed high levels of happiness and personal satisfaction before they had kids, the levels bottomed out when they were raising their kids, and then their happiness rose exponentially after their kids reached the age of 18 lol.

Scarlet and gold drapes hung over windows that overlooked the lake, and the wooden paneling ‚Äì far cry from what Harry had grown accustomed to seeing beneath the Dursleys' staircase ‚Äì gave the entire space an atmosphere of regality.

""Your bed's over here!"" shouted Ron, pulling Harry's attention away from the finery. ""Look, it's got your initials on it and everything!""

It wasn't nearly the most wondrous thing that Harry had seen that day, but the sight of the gently curling H and P brought tears to his eyes. He had only entered the room moments before, but already, he felt like he was home. It was unlike any...

""Um, *excuse* me!"" came a nasal voice from behind. ""It's impolite to assume that you are the *only* individual with those initials. That bed could very well belong to someone else.""

A brief tremor of shock caused Harry's heart to jump as he turned and regarded the boy who had spoken. For a moment, he had been certain that Dudley had somehow managed to follow him: A rotund, almost spherical body gave way to a piggish face, and the sneer of superiority (glaring out from behind too-thick glasses) was one that Harry had seen almost daily. In stark contrast to everyone else, the young man was clad in a bright shirt emblazoned with some oddly designed cartoon characters, and an enormous pillow was held tightly against his body with one pudgy hand.

""Oh, hello, Kevin,"" Ron muttered, rolling his eyes. ""I see you brought your... pillow.""

An indignant snort preceded Kevin's next words. ""Um, *actually*, she's my *waifu*. I wouldn't expect *normies* to understand.""

""'Waifu?'"" Harry repeated. ""'Normies?'""

""No, don't..."" Ron began, but he was interrupted by a long sigh from Kevin.

""Yes, my *waifu!*"" The boy looked down at his pillow. ""Asuna-chan, introduce yourself!""

Before Harry's eyes, the pillow suddenly came to be occupied by another cartoon character, this one female... and wearing very little clothing. Like the portraits Harry had encountered, the figure moved, blinked, appeared to breathe, and gave every indication of being alive. Her too-large eyes stared at Harry with an expression that almost seemed to reflect a kind of desperation.

""*Watashi no kurushimi o owara sete kudasai!*"" the pillow said.

""That means she's pleased to meet you,"" Kevin said. ""Of course, she's mostly happy to see me.""

""*Watashi wa kono y≈ç ni ikitakunai!*"" continued the cartoon woman.

""Yes, well, nice to meet you, too,"" Harry replied. He was uncertain of how else to respond... and something about the figure's voice gave him the idea that she wasn't exactly thrilled by her lot in life.

Ron stepped forward, putting himself between Harry and Kevin. ""Leave it alone, Kevin!"" he snarled. ""Nobody wants to hear about your strange obsession with Japanese wizardry!""

""Um, *actually*,"" the boy answered, once again sneering, ""the Japanese are *far* more advanced in culture than Britain could ever hope to be. I'm planning to transfer to *Hont≈ç no bashode wa arimasen* as soon as possible.""

""*Watashi ga shinu y≈ç ni shite kudasai*..."" the pillow muttered. Kevin responded with something that sounded mispronounced, then waddled off to a bed at the far side of the room.

""Sorry about him,"" whispered Ron. ""Just be glad you didn't get close enough to smell him.""

Harry sighed to himself. He still had a lot to learn about the wizarding world."" Credit to another redditor."

For real though next time call 911. In pretty much all states the cops can't charge you for possession/etc if you call 911 due to a medical emergency/overdose.

If the goal is money, then just get like the middle of the house of some rich billionaire, or the white house, or pentagon. 

If the goal is knowledge and history well, then try the vatican library. 

If the goal is fame, get it next to a therapists office. Your parents loved u. Being the center of attention doesnt make you more worthy of love. 

If the goal is love... well... idc. Owning land has nothing to do with love. "

17262,"My repost from 6 years ago (I don't remember this anymore due to a skull fracture a year ago)

I didn't see anything like that when I died. From my experience, I died from an asthma attack after being taken off of prednisone (oral steroid for severe asthmatics) after being on it for about 2 years or so. I remember before waking up and everything in my vision was red and black, and I was in a complete panic at that point in time so all I remember physically doing was hitting my nebulizer to starting taking an albuterol dose and at that point it was too late. The movement itself was completely reflexive because I'd been used to waking up struggling to breathe in the middle of the night for weeks after stopping the prednisone, including multiple ER visits and bullshit like that.

Anyway, I blacked out with the nebulizer running and fell over onto my bed and at that point I wasn't breathing any more. My neb was going and luckily, I reckon, my cord got tangled up in my arms and came off the nebulizer so it was loudly spewing out compressed air. The only thing I was was my mother walking around the house. More specifically, I was floating in the hallway, above a bookcase that used to be there, looking down the hall and I saw my mom walk out of her bedroom and go to the bathroom, leave the bathroom, stop in the hallway, walk down it to either go out the back door or to the kitchen, and then after what I'd reckon to be 2 minutes or less walk into my bedroom. At that point my dad was already in there doing CPR on me to try and get me breathing again. She always told me how my color was ash grey, my lips were blue and my eyes were rolled back into my head.

When I was watching her though, it reminds me of watching something through cloudy water, like if you take a pair of goggles and put milky water in them and then put them on, everything kind of stretches and vibrates and your perspective is different because you're looking through the water. That's how it looked to me, from when I was floating in the hallway. I can still remember that to this day. Afterwards, once she went in my room, I guess I gave up or my soul or whatever extension of my consciousness got bored and went fuck all because I really don't know what happened after that. All I can say is it felt like time was passing me by at a very fast speed, like if you can imaging sitting in a dark room with nothing around you can you can start to feel time passing you, as in what the concept of time represents, moment to moment, then speed it up by about a million or a trillion times normal speed, it'd feel like you're moving I reckon or that's at least how it felt to me. Like, becoming a mass of energy and then just compressing down and riding the wave of time, still within myself by consciously aware of a void that had been created, again within myself.

Whatever...

Of course I don't believe it's their obligation to foot the bill, but I'm assuming the groom had some valid reasons for being that salty.

17271,"We worry because if you aren't worried, you're not paying attention. Every day cost of living gets higher while pay gets lower. We're not going to be able to own homes or retire because we won't be able to afford to (retirees already can't afford to stay retired - I work retail and everyone in the store aside from management is either a college kid or over 55+). Every day the news talks about people being hurt or killed in horrifying ways. We probably know people who are dying because they can't afford to live. For a lot of us, we're never going to know financial security or even just regular peace of mind.

You know what ""making it"" is to me? A small two bedroom house with little bit of space where I can have an herb garden. I have exactly 3% confidence that I will ever be able to live that dream because I know I'll never be able to afford it. I don't want glory. I don't want fame. I want a small space of my own where I can have a spouse and one child that I can dote on and give a good life to. I'm 26 years old and already pretty much know that I'll never be able to have even that. So yeah. I'm worried about it. "

17282,"Not terrible, just tacky as hell. When I was in middle school I went to my second cousin‚Äôs wedding, which was also the first wedding I‚Äôd ever been to.

It was really small and low-budget (and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that!) at a state park‚Äôs picnic shelter. The shelter was not very attractive and had lots of spiderwebs everywhere. They had long tables set up down each side of the ‚Äúaisle‚Äù and a table up at the ‚Äúaltar‚Äù like a U. There were tissue boxes set up and down the picnic tables I guess for when everyone was moved to tears by the ceremony. 

They walked down the aisle to the Super Smash Bros theme song. They wrote their own vows and did some thing where they poured colored sand into one container to symbolize their unity. The cake was from the grocery store and they had chicken nuggets and cheese puffs for the reception (which were cold and stale by the time we ate). The DJ played the Cupid Shuffle (and several other party songs) but no one danced. Then the mother of the groom got up and sang ‚ÄúYou Are the Wind Beneath My Wings‚Äù to her son, and I could scarcely believe what I was witnessing because it was so bad. Then finally we saw them off by blowing bubbles.

On the way home, my poor sweet Southern great grandmother could only say ‚ÄúWell, that just sure was something‚Äù over and over."

17296,"Holy shit this happened to me when I was selling a pickup.

Guy FOUND my house because I listed north(town name) and he drove around looking for the pickup and calling me for 2 hours hen called and left a voicemail saying he was outside. Meanwhile I‚Äôm getting ready for work and had told him through text I couldn‚Äôt meet yet that day and if r wanted to see the truck I would need o schedule a time or him to let me somewhere else because I didn‚Äôt want people coming to our house. 

He was very upset that I wouldn‚Äôt answer the door, and got even more upset when I texted him saying I would be calling the police if he didn‚Äôt leave. 

But no, it was my fault for saying text or email to contact for meeting up. And my fault for being lazy. And my fault for wasting his time he spent finding my house. 

Needless to say my wife came with me to work that day and we told our neighbors to call the police if (truck description) shows up banging on our door. 

Ended up selling the pickup later gay evening to he first guy who looked at it and he offered more than asking price because he liked it so much. (1994 Ford ranger, with a canopy)
