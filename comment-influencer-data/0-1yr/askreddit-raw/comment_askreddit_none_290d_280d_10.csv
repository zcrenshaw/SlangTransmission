49,Because what else could have happened?
50,"Your personal trauma is preventing you from looking at this issue from an honest and holistic perspective. What happened to you is an inconceivable atrocity and you shouldn't be expected to just 'get over' what happened so you can read a reddit comment, but it is limiting you from confronting the core of the issue at hand. The entire concept of pedophila and child abuse shouldn't been seen through the lens of personal abuse. If a humanizing perspective of pedophila, like the other person presented, is something that can cause you distress or anger, it would be really beneficial to talk that out with a therapist or someone close to you. The dehumanization of pedophila doesn't help anyone or any child, and if anything it leads to more terrible things for society. You don't need to understand the motivation, thoughts, or the person of a cso or pedophile, but what you need to be able to do is stay clear of thoughts or perspectives that contribute negatively to the issue on hand, which includes dehumanization. best wishes my dude."

64,I'll post a Trigger Warning next time.
65,"Religions are like businesses.  When they're small everyone knows the owner and he directly controls everything and makes all the decisions.  He may have some bizarre behavior, but he can get away with it because nobody really pays attention to small businesses.  And there's usually people who will stay because they Really want the paycheck and being out on your own without steady pay (even if it's crap pay) is scary.  Besides, they're used to his ""quirks"" and when he's not being crazy he's really quite nice.

When they're big and have been around so long that the founder has died and they've been through a number of labor disputes....well, then they no longer have the luxury of controlling every individual or forcing bizarre whims on everyone.  Too much media attention.  Any one employee leaving is no big deal because there's always another person who needs a paycheck.  And even if the business overall is terrible and takes advantage of employees and makes the world a worse place...well, we like our coworkers and our immediate boss is decent.  Besides, would it really be better elsewhere? Probably every company is like this, right?  ....right?

Religion is what happens when a cult grows up and has outside investors."
66,Theories are things that are proven. So that's a good thing. Unless you mean everything's a hypothesis?
67,No sorry. Happiness does not exist
68,So T_D could be brigaded to death? Sounds good to me.

70,"No one's saying any of that. The Press is a cess-pit, yes, and biased as hell, but no one's saying to shoot them. At the worst, some of them have had their White House press credentials removed as they weren't operating in good faith. No one on the right is saying, ""If you don't vote our side, you can't vote."" They want voter registration, and to prevent election fraud. It's the Left that's trying to undo the process of democracy, and to gut the bill of rights. If they could, they would gut the first amendment, and completely remove the second. "
71,"As someone who worked in all kinds of cafes, burger joints, on river cruise ships and in five star restaurants, I can safely say that those people are either mentally ill, alcoholics or junkies.

78,I don‚Äôt mind explaining it if you don‚Äôt understand why.
79,"Nope. No, it isn't sci-fi. I'm not hardcore sci do guy here, but I've ready fair share of sci-fi. This ain't sci-fi. Sci-fi is fiction based on imagined future scientific advances, SPECIFICALLY to explore social, economic and environmental ideas. This movie is much more metaphorical, with pseudo-science thrown in. It's metaphors are fine, if a bit pretentious, but it makes the mistake of trying to be consistent physically as well as metaphorically, which doesn't work in this case.

Tldr; makes sense metaphorically/ideologically, very inconsistent physically/scientifically."
80,"Would've been so much easier if it was illegal, that's part of the issue. Impressionable people being incapable of making smart logical decisions, results in counterproductivity, complications, and health-issues for some citizens."
81,Another ww2 russian movie is:  enemy at the gates. Its a pretty good movie. (Yes it can be found on netflix)

You don't need a gun for self-protection if no one else has a gun."
86,"guilty pleas for unrelated crimes. It's pretty obvious that if you dig into most given politicians and everyone working under them that you'll find something eventually.

87,"Well I'm pretty sure most of the manual shit labor for which you did not need the expertise of building was done by slaves. I'm sure the ""builders"" had more power, but they were not the ones carrying blocks that weighed tons around"

93,So you‚Äôre against world unity and you would like to see cultures seperated? 
94,Assault rifle ban in the United States. No doubt about this. There's been too many mass shootings here because psychos get easy access to weapons that can kill fifty people in a matter of seconds.

101,"My beliefs on guns are that military grade weapons, such as the AR-15 or the FN Scar-L, should not be available on the commercial market. I am not opposed to weapons like a pistol or a small firearm being available. However, the concept that I could go to someone's home and they would have a fricking machine gun in their basement scares me. Also, there have been so many mass shootings, like the one in Las Vegas or the Parkland shooting, that were committed with these military grade assault rifles. "
102,Because everyone still brings it up. 
103,People who care about toiler paper direction are ridiculous anyway. I would do it just to fuck with him
104,"Years ago I had a threesome with a buddy and his wife, first time for all of us. She had never met me, so we were sitting on the couch chatting while he was sitting across from us, all of us a little nervous. She told him to get up and strip, he did, she told me to do the same. As soon as I dropped my pants, she did a double take that was right out of a cartoon.  Big confidence booster that!"

How do you know me again? Or, excuse me, how are you my doctor?

Super intrigued."
129,"Your first two paragraphs are totally unfounded assumptions.

I Ignored your point about killing the entire population because that was not the subject of my response to the previous commenter. The sub thread was talking about language only.
