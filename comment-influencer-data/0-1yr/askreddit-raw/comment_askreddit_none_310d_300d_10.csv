29,"Can't disagree more. You need to do a job you at least care somewhat about. it gives you purpose and a career progression.

I did a job I hated for years and got nowhere. Then I tried something completely new with lower pay that I cared about and am doing a lot better, and I don't dread every working day.

Lots of people here ""advise"" that hating your job is normal. It ISN'T. Most people DON'T hate their job."

35,"&gt; A pet is anxious when it's separated from it's family and being held by strangers.

If your dog is the anxious type, the same would go for any time it is taken in the back for anything, including grooming, it's not different when it's being put down. The point is, the dog doesn't know it's being put down. People pretend it does via projecting and think they have a duty to be back there for it because of that. And I think people generally do more harm than good by going back there and having that memory implanted into them for the rest of their lives unnecessarily.

&gt;Also, who puts pets under for teeth cleaning?

Do you not take your dog to the vet? The dogs are put under for teeth cleaning because they use the same sort of loud, spinning polishing tools and hooks that they use on you at the dentist, and dogs aren't going to sit still for that. Have your dogs never had teeth cleaning before?"
36,"If you're talking about Lori Mattox, she was with him willingly and has nothing but nice things to say about him, unless you've got some info I don't. He even asked her mother for permission to be with her. She WAS 14, however. That's pretty inexcusable."

FFS, you are a very strange group of people. Down voting a legit question? Yet you expect me to know all of the rules.  This is way beyond ridiculous. K,it's been sort of a slice. Bye. "

72,"At it again with your last sentence LOL. You truly can't help it can you?

You're the one failing to comprehend. Your wording has a condescending tone to it. You think you're ""teaching"" others as if you're the only one with the knowledge or experience. I mean you literally just straight up said it yourself. I know you're not capable, but you should at least attempt to see it from the perspective of someone else and not your own.

To phrase it another way.  Had Ireland vanished from the face of the earth during the Second War, nothing would have changed.  If Winston had vanished from the face of the earth during that same time, everything would have changed."

I can't believe they wouldn't make Kyle Katarn, Mara Jade , Thrawn, etc. movies."
120,"To me, Dishonored is definitely one of the biggest disappointments in my life as a gamer.

I mean, the game *was* amazing at first, but something felt... off. And after finishing the game twice, it hit me. The game is actually encouraging an aggressive playstyle, but is then *punishing* you when you actually follow that path. It does that by two means...

A) every. single. man, woman or even child you come across wants you to end the tyranny and to get rid off the people who help to enforce it. And it is actually a quite reasonable request, since this tyranny is *really* bad, with innocent people getting incercerated and even killed all the time, with ruthless scientists conducting experiments on living citizens and with people starving to death. But when you actually *do* what they want, they get all pissy, because you kill people...

Sure, I *do* have abilities and powers that can help me to advance, but does it make sense to solely use those in this world? It's like saying *""Please, dear allied soldiers, storm those beaches in the Normandy. Get killed while doing so, we don't care. But DARE you to kill any of them poor germans, then we will WILL get pissy and call you a murderer.""* 

Also, if I was the *one* person able to overthrow a tyranny, thus saving maybe millions from death and oppression and poverty, would it make sense to risk my life like that? In case I get discovered by a guard while sneaking into some super secret place, I don't risk my life by trying to just knock him out, I pull my gun and shoot the fucker. Especially when the other guys shoot on sight.

And B), using your *deadly* skills and arsenal is just sooo much more fun in this game. Seriously, the sword fighting mechanisms are bloody *brilliant* and pretty much the best I have ever encountered in a game. The arsenal of deadly traps and whatnot is insanely fun to use. Your abilitities even more so - I mean, what is not to like in possessing a goon of the tyranny, fire his gun, slow down the flow of time and make the fucker walk into his own bullet? 

But then the game *punishes* you for using all your fun skills and toys? Really? I mean, I've pre-ordered the game and one of the pre-order bonuses that came with the game was a swarm of deadly rats that eat your enemies alive. Brutal and quite grim, but also actually innovative and fun to use. And after my first playthrough I've realised that I used the damn swarm not even once. Because the game constantly told me that using it would be punished.

How stupid is that?

I know that this is just my personal point of view and that this actually might be a bit silly. I mean, the game still was fun to play. But this also left me with that nagging feeling that something just went wrong and I have never touched Dishonored 2 because of this."
121,"It's literally just hitting a ball into a goal... and that's the entire game.  All of it.  It's boring and if you've played one match, you've played all the content it has to offer."

I don't find the jokes funny, I don't find the acting competent, the story is insanely weak. It's quotable but then so is The Room.

YMMV but it's not my cup of tea."
