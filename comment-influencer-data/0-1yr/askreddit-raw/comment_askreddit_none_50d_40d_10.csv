0,And yet racism is still alive and well. In fact it seems to be making a big comeback in recent years.
1,"lmao a ""gaming organization"""
2,Donkey
3,Peter Griffin
4,Not a lot of variety at all. Everything is made with the same ingredients just in a different way.
5,especially when you are shitting on other people's comments
6,You're so naive ita surreal
7,"&gt; no one will be laughing when dealing with climate change.

Climate change is not some death sentence for the world

The current scientific consensus does not show an emergency. It is a slight uptick in wars in sub-saharan africa, slight decrease in crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa and Central America, and in a few areas we will need flood walls or to have people move a few miles inland.

The first 2 are unimportant to people in first world countries, the latter sucks ass but is not all that significant"
8,"SPEAK to them. TELL them how you feel. It won’t work, but you need at least a little communication before you decide anything rational."
9,Yes because republicans consistently put funding for the wall in those bills. If you really want to stop using these kids as political leverage maybe they should leave the wall funding out of the bills to help fund them.
10,Because 'global warming' has been a  Jewish funded hoax since the 60s. Who do you think owns the solar/wind power companies goy?
11,"I think they will simply be forgotten more than ridiculed and laughed at. 

The rest of the things he mentioned are pretty much the things that old people always make fun of younger generations for and the styles come and go."
12,"Yes. It's a thing. 

Idiots have access to the entirety of mankind's knowledge in the palm of their hand, and they choose to watch videos of cats doing stupid shit, and post memes of ""grump cat"" 

The catholic church was right to restrict knowledge way back when....  Most people aren't competent or worthy enough to have access to it."
13,"I’m calling you out on bullshit. You’re not answering anything, just side-stepping enough to not be called out on any specific claim. “They’re so decentralized”? Who is? What groups? 

You’re suggesting some massive conspiracy between Hollywood and Government, yet paradoxical, claim they’re so decentralized that you can’t say who or what they are. So then it isn’t a *conspiracy* is it?"
14,Karma for eating steak
15,I big step for a country fifty years behind the rest of the world.
16,Satanichia Kurumizawa McDowell is the overall bestgirl to ever exist.
17,Fuck cops lmao eat shit pigs
18,Yes but something about being dominant with younger boys (13-15) I just... like it
19,We still don’t even fully understand how aspirin provides pain relief. We just know it does.
20,Every single person being a unique snowflake and the world being too PC for it’s own good.
21,No this isn't subjective. You said those shows were about children being cruel to each other and they are simply not. You spread bullshitfreely and then when called on it you double down. You are an asshole please stop mieading people and then whining when you're wrong. Watch rugrats and learn how to be wrong without crying. You just want your bullshit to be true but it's not.
22,Sheek
23,Trump.
24,It's a remake of an original movie. It is its own thing and its success will depend strictly on how well the movie is made. End of story.
25,"I wasn't saying you're wrong. Just seems like it's commonly a confusing question.

Simple check on a wiki site, and things are mostly answered."
26,Loss of limb is actually unlikely?
27,I wouldn't say this is 100% untrue. It happens quite a bit. Though I agree that it can be infuriating if you just refuse sex because you want to sleep.
28,Same difference.
29,Donald Trump is a racist/rapist/pedophile.
30,"&gt;They didn't have the technology to fake the moon landings.

Yes, they did. They had to doctor some footage because some of it was lost."
31,"Her boobs are real, but I don't know if she calls them ""the twins"", but she should."
32,"If someone decides to screw me over, I will look at what is happening, find evidence that said screwing is happening, then take appropriate action. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I will NOT do, is think something is happening, ask questions that I already know will prove my point, and then make a big deal out of nothing, meanwhile I'm not actually being screwed over"
33,"Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure he wasn't married."
34,"&gt; It's the natural order of life. Living creatures eat each other

So what?

Can someone kill and eat you because ""It's the natural order of life. Living creatures eat each other""? That's a justifiable killing?"
35,Yea yea “man on moon” yea okay.
