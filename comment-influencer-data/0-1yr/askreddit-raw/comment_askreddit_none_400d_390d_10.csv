3,"Unfortunately the only ones suffering long time consequences from this are the bullied, not the bullies.

I am fine with now, but it fucked up my social skills for such a long time. Everybody acted like it was just kids being kids, but it made me actually pretend to be sick just to not have to go to school and see those people. When we had our final school trip for a week i begged my father not to send me there and i didnt have to go. I couldnt tell the teachers either, because people that reported being bullied were basicly made a lot worse. Teachers thought ""oh kids are being kids"" and partially thought stuff like taking the bullied to the front of the class and say ""He/she is so nice, dont bully him/her!"". It made me hate school, it hurt my grades, it long time hurt my social behaviour and i never want to see most of them ever again. After school i moved to pretty much the other end of the country and i got to have a fresh start. Teachers could have helped, the parents of the bullies could have helped - but all didnt want to put consequences on the poor kids."

I don’t want to lose him. He’s my best friend, my baby, the love of my life. He’s 100% blind now, but still recognizes my voice it seems.

It's established that it took Andy most of his 20 years to dig the hole. I know Andy was the warden's trusty, but there wasn't one single shakedown or search or punishment in the entire 20 years? 

EDIT: Yes I do remember the earlier ""I don't approve of this...but maybe exceptions can be made"" scene. It's still a bit hard to believe that there wasn't a single thing in 20 years. Especially when Andy starts going against the Warden....they never tossed his cell or removed all his things as punishment?"

I mean, if someone was in a crazy cult, then, maybe it would be a bad idea for them to hold public office, but just because someone is an atheist doesn't make them a bad person. As far as I know, the US has freedom of (and from) religion.  And for the curious, I am Catholic."

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

71,"For me, it's just losing that feeling of innocence you had in your youth. Like seeing your crush in class and imagining a relationship in your head. Hanging out with good friends and all it was was swimming, eating junk food, watching movies. No alcohol or drugs, just a family sized dorito bag and Dr. Pepper. It's hard to put it into words, but I miss that feeling when you and your crush would sit on some bleachers and you felt nothing could go wrong. No worrying about sex or marriage, just you and the person of your affections just talking about life, nearly holding hands. When you get older you lose the excitement of so many firsts. Your first kiss, your first time sneaking out, your first time walking around a mall without parental guidance, first this and first that. Life just felt so exhilirating. The feeling begins to fade out as you get older and it's hard. Those times were so happy and stupid."

It was around 1am so it was utter darkness(I struggled to cope with this since I was still adjusting to being 50 miles off shore with a madman let alone in complete darkness for as far as we could see.)

The diagram you've linked is further corroborated by [this annotated screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/55xyW2B.png) which makes sense, because the electric fence doesn't extend all the way to a tunnel, so there has to be a drop to contain the rex. On your diagram, that wall at 45 degrees is also the wall containing the pipe that Lex sits in. And finally, [in the original stop-motion concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1IaR4RCZ2I), the rex drags the car further back up the rack as you said.

Spielberg has said that it was a bit of a hole and that he doesn't care, and the trees in the drop aren't tall enough, but for me it all still works."

You are seriously fucking parts of the rest of the world and I think you could be really influential if you embraced climate friendly policies and set goals to be achieved. I also understand that the vast majority of US citizens acknowledges humans impact on the climate, but the fact that some politicians and citizens still deny it is just mindboggling l.

Edit: to clarify on my original statement, I'm afraid of what's going to happen if the trend with politicians who deny humans impact on climate change continues. The US isn't doing too bad at the moment, but you could do better. But what's going to happen in the future when the amount of climate deniers increase in both the population and amongst politicians? That's where my fear lies."
102,"When I was in 8th grade we had a joke that a friend of mine was so smart because he did crack. So one day I made a pipe similar to [this](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6c3e273c3fd5c5360bd157caf0f7f4ac) out of aluminum foil for lunch and joked that I found his pipe. My teacher saw and took it away. I tried to cover by saying it was a soup spoon, with a scoop but also had a straw for the broth. My teacher was not buying it and said, ""I'm not stupid, I know what that is."" and she gave me a week's detention. On the slip she only wrote, ""making a pipe in class"" so I played it off to my parents that I made a corncob pipe as a joke instead of a crack pipe since that sounded better.

During a drunken conversation with my sister at a bar she told me a story that I remembered but always processed as a dream. When I was 3 and she was 5 we heard our mom fighting with our dad on the phone and the only words I remember are ""hooker"" and ""jail"". Fast forward about four hours as we're sitting with my mom and my grandpa (my father's father) and there's a violent pounding on the door. My mom rushed us to the coat closet as the front door was kicked in. My dad barged in, pushed over his own father, and hit my mom in the face and then ran around yelling for my sister and me. Next thing I see as we are looking through the crack in the door is my mom jump on his back and execute a nearly perfect rear naked choke until he was out cold. We left him there and went to McDonald's and none of us brought it up again. My mom couldn't believe I remembered and felt horrible for never talking to me about it but I never said anything so she assumed I didn't remember.

Tldr: my ""dad"" was/is a piece of shit who got arrested for cheating on my mom with hookers and then tried to kidnap my sister and me while physically hurting my grandpa and mom in the process. Oh, and my mom can beat up your mom. "

125,"If you're a new driver in the UK, you pretty much need a ""black box"" in order for your insurance to not be unbearably expensive. Like your situation, it monitors your driving so that the insurance company can cancel your contract if you drive poorly too much; they can set a curfew in your contract so you're limited on how late you can drive. Of course there's an app which shows how good you drive, or how close to cancellation you are.

A new driver contract with black box for a small car like a Ford Fiesta or Fiat 500 will cost you around £1200, but without a black box that will increase to over £2000; I don't know if this situation is similar in other countries."

148,"The struggle to have doctors perform diagnostics is insane.  

I have a small lump in my shoulder that has been there for nearly 10 years that causes me chronic pain.  No amount of deep tissue massages has had an impact on it.  It causes me near daily pain.

The doctor touches it once and says it's ""probably"" just fibrous tissues.  No tests. No scans of any sort.  When I ask if there are any scans we can do, my PCP told me that no scans would actually show anything there if it was just fibrous tissue and that cutting out fibrous tissue is more dangerous and likely to result in other chronic issues to make it not worth it.   

Well OK... but what if it's not fibrous tissue? You barely touched my shoulder!  You can tell it's not cancer or a tumor or some sort of slipped cartilage or growth or literally any number of things it could be with a single light touch. But no... I'm an otherwise ""healthy"" young adult so my pain clearly isn't real and the lump clearly can't be something serious.  

So I suppose die of some sort of undiagnosed lymphoma that's just my fate.  

Next annual physical I'm going to demand scans, though. 

But I tell a doctor I have a fucking lump, and you can feel it, I should get some sort of scan.  I shouldn't have to beg and bargain and plea and doctor-shop to find someone willing to put in more than 10 seconds of effort to diagnose a problem.

We got slammed that night so the close was going to go until at least 12 (we closed at 10).

He sends one of our cooks home, and then the dishwasher. I walk up to him and say “What the fuck are you doing? If you cut those guys we are going to he here until 2:30 in the morning.” I had school the next morning and wasn’t prepared to be there for that long for no reason other than making the shift leader’s labour look good.

He told me to shut up and do my job because he’s in charge, and I flipped shit on him. Told him he was a power tripping narcissist that had no idea what he was doing in the kitchen. He told *me* to clock out! I shrugged and did it. I was outside cooling off because I got pretty worked up, when the manager came outside and asked me if I had been told to clock out. I explained, and she asked me to clock back in because she wasn’t ready to be here until 2AM either. So I finished the shift, we finished about one in the morning. I thought for sure I’d get written up the next time I came in, but instead the actual kitchen manager was like, “What you said is accurate, just don’t flip out like that again.” Worked there for another year before I finally quit."

171,"I just remembered another.

We were celebrating one of my friend’s birthdays and she lives in a military base. It was just us three and the two cats, and her parents were out of town. Her lights would randomly turn on throughout the house, and every time we were upstairs the basement door would violently slam shut. 
It was around 2:30 or 3am when we decided to go to bed, I was sleeping in the guest room and they were sleeping in her room. On our way up the stairs, the light went out on it’s own, and we heard this skittering noise across the living room floor below and coming up the stairs. It wasn’t the sound of the cats, they were already on the bed in the guest room. 
My friends screamed and bolted into their room, I ran into mine and when I shut the door I heard the skittering turn the corner and scurried across the floor down the hallway towards my door, thudding against it. 

After about half an hour of all three of us texting each other in a group chat about what the hell just happened, they decided to open their door to come sleep in the guest room with me. We were all terrified and thought about calling a cab to go back to my house, they told me it thudded on their door as well.

Edit: I love how it’s tagged Serious yet everyone’s trying to “debunk” this. 

Both cats were in the room with ME.
I went to the guest room because I wanted to make sure the cats were safe so I didn’t follow my friends. They turned right into the first room down the hallway and slammed the door, I’ll be damned if demons touch any kitties. &gt;:(
Rats? This thing sounded like it weighed the same size as a large dog.
Explain the door opening and closing violently with the windows shut. It didn’t open just a crack, it fully swung open like someone kicked it open from the other side.

182,"Not OP but I had a similar experience with a girl who only wanted anal and even though I still have a bit of a fetish for anal and really enjoy it. When you want to do anal it's not like in porn where everything is prelubed, prestretched, and clean. With vaginal sex, if you're doing your job right and under normal circumstances (some girls are just a bit drier than others) you can pretty much spit on the top, slide in, give a few heartbeats for her to climatize then you can pretty much start with some half way slow thrusting.

With anal everything takes longer, even after you're both super turned on, you have to stop and lube everything up, then even if she's super wet and turned on, you still have to start with a finger, not only to spread the lube but you also have to continue foreplay, because the stopping to lube kills the mood a bit, then usually a second finger, because even after one, things probably still aren't quite stretched/""warmed up"" enough for the size of a penis yet, then even once you actually get to put yourself inside her, you have to go glacially slowly compared to vaginal since even after two fingers it takes a bit of getting used to, then you have to site still and wait for about double the time, it's only a few seconds, but when you're finally inside your girl it feels like forever, then you have to go epically slowly to begin with, since again the mood is killed a little bit during insertion, then after you're done you can't just pee to clean the pipes and a quick rinse to clean off, you just had your dick in a girls ass you've got lube (silicone lube as well if you do lots of anal, which takes plenty of soap and water to get off and doesn't just rinse off) and other stuff on your junk probably, so it basically requires a shower once you're done.

Vaginal sex is just much easier, requires much less prep and much less cleanup once you're done. But then again, anal sex can be really fun as long as you're willing to take the time for it  and go slow so, worth it. "

206,"I remember when I was 9 years old I used to hang this dumb paper chains in my room. I would just hang up pieces of paper on a wall, like decorations. Anyways one day I was playing in the room and looked forward at my shadow and just stared at my shadow. For some reason it seemed a little off. 

Then the shadow proceeded to stretch up, or stand up (it’s hard to describe) and a hand reaches up and knocked one off the papers off the wall, and it was taped up there pretty good. I remember freaking the fuck out and just bolted out of there into my grandmas room. 

Over time I got over that, but then 8 years later I remember telling my dad the story as a joke because I thought he would laugh, and his response was “oh yeah, you mean shadow people? Yeah our family always sees that, especially the oldest in each family. I’ve seen it, my dad has seen it,  my mom has seen it, and her mom etc...” (Btw they are the oldest siblings in their family, as am I) 

I was scared of course, but thought he was fucking with me again, so I called my grandpa and grandma literally 10 minutes later about shadow people and they proceeded to tell me all these stories about being followed and scarier shit than I’ve experienced. 

It honestly freaked me the fuck out and since then I try to look away from my shadow. 

Also, my grandma has a lot of shadow people stories but refuses to tell me because, as she has told me, I’m very sensitive and wouldn’t be able to take it. She’s not wrong. "

Drinking on duty is a big no no, but I only had myself to blame. Fair play to all concerned.

These same two pubs used to play practical jokes on each other. They once snuck into our beer cellar and put pinholes in the (pressurised) beer lines. We lost a grand total of about a pint of beer, but in the form of a mist that filled the cellar and then coated everything in a sticky residue. In return we replaced the rinse aid on their glasswasher with bubble bath just after they closed up, giving them a foam party for the last few loads of glasses. It was surprisingly complicated coming up with pranks that wouldn't actually inconvenience the customers."

Indeed, earlier this year I talked to another one. She was much better, she listened to me, offered her point of view, tried to give me little things I should aim for and was overall more empathic.

The other guy I wrote about was not. I sat in his room, bawled my fucking eyes out while talking about that everything was just grey and I can't find motivation to do anything and I eat to much cause it's the only thing that fills a void and I can't feel emotions towards other people anymore and I can't go on like this and how I want it all to end.

And he's like ""Hurr Durr, your problem is your fat and alone, lose weight and find a woman and everythings gets better!""

And I thought: ""Bitch, I just literally cried in front of you, because food is the only thing that makes me feel a little warmer and I have no fucking feelings towards women and I don't even have any interest in sex. Isn't there a problem with your idea?!""

255,"Snape is the reason Harry survived. He begged Voldemort not to kill lily, and even though she was muggle born Voldy still gave her the option to walk away and live because of snape’s request. Nobody else has ever had the option to be spared by voldy, which is why Lily’s choice to protect her son was able to save him. IIRC, Voldy explicitly told lily to step aside multiple times, but she repeatedly chose harry over her own life. 

It’s the same as in the deathly hallows during the battle of hogwarts when harry sacrifices himself and willingly goes into the forest to die. Harry had the choice to run and live, but he chose to die to protect those he loved without even trying to fight back. Because of his love for them, all of the students and the OotP members were protected from the death eaters and voldy after his sacrifice. 

Fun fact: This is one of the reasons Snape hated Neville so much. He also could have been the one that the prophecy refers to, and if Voldy went after him instead of Harry, Lily would have survived. "

it's about 1am and i have just finished my shift working nightfill and as i leave the front door i see a woman in her 40's standing by the cab rank offering to blow the cab drivers to take her home. they all say no (I don't think any of them wanted to say yes in front of the other drivers) so she started to walk. 

as i walked the 5mins to get to my car i was kind of wishing i had the balls to offer her a lift. at the time I was 19 and only had a few sexual encounters and she looked sort of like more trashy version of lisa rinna.

I make my way out of the shopping plaza and after a few turned i'm just about to turn onto the main I see her walking about 100m ahead. i do the quick pro/cons list of how it goes. 

con i get robbed 

con she gets piss

pro if she gets pissed i drive away and nobody knows but me

con i drive her and when she gets there she just gets out of the car 

pro if that happens the worse you lose is a few buck in gas but if she does blow you it will be worth it

so basically i come to the view as long as I didn't get robbed it was worth the risk. so thankfully as i got to the light it was red so i rolled down my window and said ""hey...does that offer still stand?"" in my teen voice.  

she leaned into the window and asked what offer. I said the one about the blowjob if i drive you home? she stepped back looked at my car and said you aren't a cab driver. to which i said ""yeah, i know, but i don't really get many bj offers so i thought i would ask anyways"" 

she looked me up and down then said do you know where the civic video in padstow is? i said yes and she got in. we made some small chit chat and at this point i was pretty sure she was just stalling to we got there but i had made piece with that, so i slowly lowered my expectations the closer we got closer.

then just as we got near there there was a roundabout and i'm about to turn right she says no points to the park and tells me to turn left. me being dumb i ask why and she says i'm not gonna blow you on a main road, there is a park just over, pull over, i will blow you and then you can drop me off.

I was so confused. What did she mean by ""too""? Did she think they invaded her home state too? Also I was left dumbfounded wondering if this adult woman had never seen a map of the world. We're a landlocked country in central/western Europe and North Korea is in far east Asia. How the hell were they going to invade us.

I'm still so confused. But it's a story that always gets lots of laughter on parties. This and countless other stories with American tourists, they're really good at comedy it seems."

307,"Not ""drama"", per se. Just not a great time atm.

I'm the third man in a three-man building company. Two brothers and myself. I am the least proficient in my skills out of us. 

Recently, one of the brothers has gotten a DUI (his 2nd). He'd been doing projects in his own neighborhood, seeing as his license is suspended. Meanwhile, myself and the other brother have been working toward finishing the main summer build outside of town (about an hour away for me).

Now that we're pushing to finish out the contract, we need all hands on deck. Since I live closer to the brother with the DUI, I willingly volunteered to drive him for the last week of building. That means 45 min west to his house, 1.5 hrs east (in major crosstown traffic) to the jobsite, 8 to 10 hrs on site, and then back the same route.

Very. Fucking. Taxing.

Meanwhile, since I don't know as much about every aspect of building as my boss, I constantly get slight scoffing and moments of being talked down to. That's a little bit beside the point, but makes it sting harder when I find out the next bit of info:

Since our next project (that is waaay closer to my house) is being hung up with permits, we're going to be continuing to button up things for our current client.

So once the brother with a DUI gets a leg monitor, there's a potential that he will want to keep going out to the site, via my driving. Which is not what I had agreed to and will not be supporting.

I have a week of vacation to consider the way I will frame my future conversations and remind myself as to why I enjoy carpentry and the company I work with. That is all. "

315,"After an extremely dramatic break-up with my college gf who was studying abroad, I needed to get the heck out of Dodge. Dealing with the mess we'd made seemed like it'd be both miserable and pointless (it was an objectively bad relationship), so I made a snap decision to study abroad the following fall semester. That way I'd be gone off-campus when my ex got back, and we'd all have plenty of space to chill the eff out. I decided to go to Brazil again, as I'd done a summer program in the south and wanted to get to know the northern parts of the country too. Plus...my 21 year old logic figured Brazilian women would be a fantastic way to get my mind off my ex.

I picked a program focusing on social justice and sustainable development, two things I'm passionate about, in a small, gorgeous city in the northeast, far from the glitz and glam of Rio or Sao Paolo. I was 100% ready for an ""Eat, Pray, Love"" self-care regimen, mixed with a healthy dose of being a man-ho. And also ready to, you know, study and stuff.

The first day, our study abroad class met up for the orientation spiel and activities, as we'd all come from different universities in the US. We were sitting in chairs in a circle. I don't know how to explain it, but I was talking with the guys by me and I just heard this laugh. It cut through all the chatter somehow, which is odd, because it wasn't loud or piercing. The best way I can describe it is like RIGHT between a VERY girly giggle and a super sweet, good-hearted chuckle. I literally trailed off mid-sentence. I looked across our circle to the source, this girl. She had long, dark brown hair and big, almond-shaped brown eyes. She was wearing this deep orange blouse that was the color of a sunset with flowers on it, and short khaki shorts over the longest legs. And she was making the girls around her CRACK UP.

I won't call it love at first sight, but I was definitely infatuated. I spent the rest of my time there falling in love with her. We made out that first night when we all went clubbing as a bonding activity. I not-so-subtly (and completely unnecessarily) changed the focus of my final project so our research would overlap, and we'd get to go on excursions together. I sat next to her on a bus ride to a small village, and saw she was, for leisure, reading a book about redlining and its role in the history and development of Chicago, which was just...sploosh. Found out she was from a town like 20 minutes away from my hometown. She even used to go to track practice at my high school, because my town built this amazing new track facility when we were both high school students. We snuck out of our tents during a class camping trip, in the middle of a rainstorm, to meet each other on the river banks and make out. We didn't want to be ""that"" study abroad couple, so we tried to play it cool, but it became increasingly impossible for me. She wasn't the most confident swimmer, but she followed me away from a group swim one afternoon, and we kissed under the waterfall. Every day, I got to know her a little better, and so every day I fell for her even harder.

That was seven years ago. We're still together. I went all the way to Brazil to fall head-over-heels in love with a Jersey girl."

There's something just completely more hindering and unsettling in rural Malaysia in the dark jungle, well even in urban areas that have patches of jungle. It really fucks with your mind at night I found.

I was driving this rural road in east M'sia with my dad and grand father, I volunteered to drive because ""so cool I get to drive in M'sia! "", I must've been 18 or so at the time. Everyone is passed out in the truck, which was an 80s Isuzu trooper I was driving and the lights are... 80s suv kind of inadequate lights, there are zero street lights this remote of a location and it's just the moonlight on the road and my crap headlights. Anyways I remember coming over the crest of a hill and seeing someone in a white shirt, beige shorts and the typical blue flip flops walking with a bike that had a red reflector shine on the back over the next hill and I told myself to be mindful of someone walking on the single lane jungle road as I was doing about 80km/h. I come to where that person is supposed to be and nothing, there's no one, no bike, there hadn't been a house, dwelling, kampung for 20 mins before that or in between, I just kind of rubbed my eyes, had this weird pit of the stomach impending doom feeling but continued driving along kind of creeped out the whole time. 

That's when stories of my parents on bicycles at night as kids and seeing vanishing white human figures played back in my head and never forget that incident. "

335,"So there were a lot of reasons I left my college (depression, lots of family issues/deaths), but this is one of the biggest ones.

Nobody took the classes seriously at all. There were always tools and weirdos who would disrespect the professors to their faces, waste everybody's time, etc. The only people who actually gave a damn about the material were shy, and had... problems of their own.

The rest of the students were just there for a degree. They couldn't have cared less about learning, and to them the college experience was just partying/drugging about. Growing as people, learning about life, taking interesting classes... Nah. It was actually uncanny how generally obnoxious my fellow students were. 

And it showed in the faculty and systems in the school, too. Every professor was hanging on for dear life, barely controlling their classes. They had to walk this tightrope where they were constantly on alert for ""problematic"" students, because they could easily lose their jobs or get reprimanded if someone complained. Everything had to be painfully explained to a tee, and repeated like we were grade-schoolers. Barely any consequences for anything, and your hand was held everywhere (except where it fucking mattered). Oh, and every faculty member was constantly swamped with extra work unrelated to their classes, that very obviously took away from time they could have spent working on material or helping out students.

I went to college to meet like-minded people, man. I wanted to finally be free of the clique-ish idiocy of HS, to meet intelligent people who could give me some direction and help me grow...

Instead, I got Highschool 2.0.

This is the true problematic trend that America is facing right now, that no-one is talking about; the future of education. Schooling is going down the fucking drain and nobody seems to notice or care, but it's likely to damage several generations. "

Mr B would pretend to be appalled and cover his eyes, but he was actually looking. Another time he gave me a kiss on the cheek and sort of tucked me in, but I made it clear I didn't like that. It never occurred to anyone to report it, he just had that proclivity and you had to be on your guard.

TL:DR; An amazing angel of a human gifted me a flight from Denver to Pittsburgh because she saw how much my boyfriend had just beat me up.


I had an extrememtly abusive boyfriend for (way too many) years. The first time he hurt me he dragged me by my ankles across the gravel and rocks out of the bed of his truck I was taking a nap in (middle of the night, we were camping). We were across the country from where all of my friends and family were so bleeding all over and upset I demabded he take me to the airport and buy me a ticket home or I would call the police. I got to the airport, he gave me $100 and took off. I immediately went to the bathroom and cleaned myself up as best as possible so I wouldnt draw attention to myself. Then I went around trying to find any flight to my home state as soon and as cheap as possible. The last ticketing counter I went to to, with no ossible options at the others, told me it'd be $400something and the flight left in 3 hours. I just started bawling my eyes out, amd this sweet woman said something along the lines of ""what's wrong honey? Are you okay?"" I showed her my busted up palms that were filled with gravel and cut open and explained what happened. She told me to hang on a sec and ended up gifting me a flight with one of her buddy passes or whatever they're called. She was SO kind I will never forget how amazong she was. She even said ""don't go getting too drunk with that $100 before the flight and get kicked off"" I went on southwests website and figured out how to tell them about their employees or whatever you would call it and told them how AMAZING she was. Margo from Southwest at the Denver International Airport, if you ever see this I wanna thank you again for being so incredible to me that day."

378,"Wasn’t presumed dead, per se. But I did die on the table during brain surgery. Heart stopped. Electrical brain activity ceased and they nearly pronounced me dead. Apparently there was probably *minimal* brain activity because they were able to re-start the ticker and my vitals stabilized. 

Doctors told my parents that I’d never speak again, and that they should be prepared for me to be a completely different person. And that I’d be profoundly cognitively impaired. 

I was in a coma for 2 months, and when I came out, I was talking, walking, and apparently flirting with a pretty nurse quite inappropriately (that’s out of character for me). The doctors were astounded and said that they thought the chance of recovery was so low that they didn’t even mention the possibility to my parents. I’m missing Broca’s area, but I’m lucky to have been ambidextrous and pretty smart. Likely that I have a “different” type of brain where things that are normally just on the left side also map to some parts of my brain on the right side. Also i likely have a denser/ more massive than normal brain which is correlated to higher recovery rate if you buy into Brain Reserve Capacity theory. Hooray for handedness!

For about a year, I had some minor quirks, like a lack of impulse control (hence the nurse situation). Nowadays, I’m 100% right as rain and work in an incredibly cognitively demanding field. The only lasting impact is my memory isn’t what it once was, but I keep lists to stay on track and I do just fine. I’m a lucky fellow to have the severity of injury I had and survive, much less have a normal life. Every day is a gift, my friends. "

Died age 30, heart attack. Just keeled over in the street one day and was dead before the ambulance arrived.

1. We take the same bus.
2. My appearance.

It doesn't matter how devastatingly handsome he is, if he and I know nothing about each other and have never even talked about the weather, that's going to be a little off-putting.

It is a very high quality port of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, and works much better on touch than I would have imagined. The only IAPs it has is three expansion sets (Wacky Worlds, Time Twister, and Toolkit), which I'd call optional.   

It is kind of the polar opposite of most mobile games, no annoying ads, no conveyor belt of ""challenges"", limited &amp; valuable IAPs, and deep gameplay.

It took Lebron 15 years to get to that many assists and he's 33 yrs old now. At his pace, he'd have to play for another 15 years and keep up his current pace. Then he would reach that milestone at almost 50 years old.

My freshman year, I was riding home on the bus. A boy stands up behind my seat and asks me, ""hey, can I borrow your phone? I forgot my house key and my mom isn't home"" so I said yes, give him my phone. He hands it back about a minute later, and two seconds after that I receive a text ""hey :P""

426,"The Butterfly Effect is a mine field of plot holes; but one always stood out to me.  For those unfamiliar with the plot, Ashton Kutcher can go back in time to change decisions he made throughout his life to create new ""realities"".  In a series of shocking twists, these changes often have drastic consequences.

In one ""reality"", Ashton is in prison and for some reason needs to convince his cellmate that he is the second coming or some shit.  Ashton does his time jump trick to be back in his elementary school class where he impales both of his hands.  Back in prison, his cellmate is won over by Ashton's seeming ability to conjure stigmata scars out of thin air.  The problem here is that given the rules laid out by the movie, Ashton would have had those scars since childhood.  Therefore his scars wouldn't have ""appeared"" while in jail, they would have been there all along.  The appropriate response from his cellmate shouldn't have been ""wow, a miracle"" but ""you're pretty fucked up if you think impaling your own hands proves you're christ"".  Not only this, but apparently intentionally impaling your hands in grade school suffers no further consequences which could potentially change your future.  Wings off of a butterfly...history changed.  Child self inflicts serious bodily damage...no societal response.

This is a dumb movie that I have seen way too many times (albeit not in years).  Possibly just to hate watch this one scene."

She was super friendly and outgoing and, like, very unique. When I talk about this it’s hard not to just describe every time I had a meaningful encounter with her. But one day in class, I moved over to sit by a bunch of my friends and their conversation left me feeling distant and depressed and like alone? Idk I have anxiety issues. But I was sitting there spaced out and this girl stops her conversation and from across the room calls over to me and just said “Hannah you’re beautiful”. And like I almost cried because no ever noticed or maybe never cared when I’d have moments like this. The world would just keep turning around me. For the next few weeks I remember having tried to work up the courage to tell her I liked her haircut or have a conversation with her. This was all probably last January. Very soon it’ll be six months since she died.

451,"I had been having the shittiest day I’d had in awhile. I was on my way home and I had about 30 miles left in my tank of gas. I would be passing three gas stations on the way home, but the one I like to go to (yay anxiety) is about 3 minutes past my house. I first one I pass is always about 30 cents too expensive, so I didn’t stop there. I sometimes stop at the second, I just felt like I shouldn’t, so I didn’t. The third I’ve never gone to before, and it’s always empty, and I got there and just couldn’t do it, because anxiety. I thought about going home and just getting gas the next day but something was compelling me to just go get it over with now. So I sucked it up and went to the one past my house even though it meant I’d get home a little bit later. I went and ended up being reunited with a friend I hadn’t seen in a year and it ended up turning my whole day around, and for me that’s important because it probably saved me from spending the next few days in bed staring at the floor. Not the neatest story in the world but it’s weird how something so minor can sometimes make a big difference "

Only kicker is that his family was super well-off and he came from an affluent Chicago neighborhood and had zero farming experience and never really worked at anything in his life which leads me to believe he just did it to make his parents upset  "
461,"Yep. I'm the same. When I was really small, I would think of things too look forward to when I wanted to make myself happy. Christmas. My birthday. Sleep overs and play dates with friends. The release of a new video game. Simple stuff. 

Now? I couldn't really think of a single thing. I don't lust for material wealth so I miss out on a lot of that. I love my family but holidays are mostly overwhelming and emotionally confusing for me. Simple questions like ""hey, how ya been?"" become stressfully anticipated and avoided because ""good/fine/etc"" isn't an honest answer and I hate lying, but I don't want to burden anyone else with my seemingly source-less pain. My friends are still around but we've moved on to vastly different interests and stages in our lives. Most are settled down with young families. I am not. 

So what is there to look forward to, really? My workouts. The occasional random periods of happiness I come upon now and again. And saddest of all---drug use. Drugs have become my refuge. I've been as safe and careful as I can be, but I could easily see opiates giving me the same feeling at 34 that thinking of Christmas did at 8. "

482,"I used to tap my fingers in a pattern. I'd make two angled lines connected at one end, like an acute angle: bottom, point, top, top, point, bottom. 

In my head, I was counting, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1. Each pass up and down would add another imaginary layer to the angle. If I messed up or if I wanted to stop, I would erase the stack of lines by sweeping them away in my head. I'd make a little huff and often shake my head when I whooshed them away, too.

I didn't know this was a tick or that it was abnormal. Most of the time I wasn't even thinking about it when I did it. It just sort of became something that helped me calm down when I was stressed or anxious. 

Then at the lunch table one day, I was into it while eating my crappy cardboard pizza. My two friends at the time were eating with me and we were chatting about something or other to do with boys. Then one of them suddenly went, ""why the fuck do you always do that? Are you autistic?""

I didn't realize I was doing it so I didn't know what she meant until she explained. She and my other friend went on to tell me how much it had been bothering them that I was always doing that. The little head shakes and huffs and taps freaked them out but they never said anything because I was cool otherwise, or so they said.

I sort of freaked out about it. I felt like an android who thought they were a human until an injury revealed their wires and metal bones. The three of us didn't talk about it again, but it stayed with me.

I became extremely conscious of the habit and started actively working to fix it. It took 2 years, a book called ""how to break a habit in 72 days,"" and a lot of tears to break, but I did it. I didn't even know it was ""OCD brought on by generalized anxiety brought on by childhood trauma"" until my psychiatrist diagnosed me at 24. 

So now I'm OCD in recession? Who knew?

Tl;dr: 

I tapped my fingers,

All my friends asked wtf?

Whoops, I'm OCD.

Edit 2: so many people replied explaining similar ticks!! I wish I wasn't running to get to work or I'd take the time to reply to each of you individually! I actually will do that when I get to my lunch break :) 

I'll quickly paraphrase my psychiatrist here, ""This type of compulsion is common but still difficult to stop. When you feel like the world around you isn't within your control, the tapping and counting may be what your mind creates to *take* that control back. You get to erase it when it's wrong, and it's satisfying when it's right. That's part of the reason it's so hard to stop even when you know it's happening."""

But I came home after work, it’s dark, and I hear the rustling in the bin. So I open the lid on the bin and sure enough he’s in there eating god knows what. At this point neither of us are really surprised or frightened by the other so I just sat there and had a casual conversation with him while he ate his dinner.

He eventually climbed onto rim of the bin (still only a shoulders length from me) and we said our goodbyes as he then proceeded to make his way off into the night.

567,"So, heres some real advice from someone whos had to battle these fuckers and successfully killed them.

You are the food source. This is the single most important thing to keep in mind when forming a strategy to kill them. The second most important thing to understand, is that they dont see as you and I do, they dont hear us per say, they find their food(you) by sensing heat. This is why they often climb on the ceiling, your body heat rises and they can tell when to drop down on you.

I killed them by buying a powder called Diatomaceous Earth(There is a food grade version if you have pets). Its essentially crushed up shells that gets inside the crevices of the bugs shell and cuts them up, drying them out. Once they get it on them, it takes them about 24 hours to die. I tested it when I first got it by putting a couple in a salt shaker with some of the powder. The trick then is just to find a way to force them to move through it. I spread it around all of the edges of the walls in case they tried to climb up the wall, I created circles around anything that contacted the floor. The only problem you really have after doing that, is that if you keep using the furniture that is infested, they dont have to leave and keep feeding off of you if you use that furniture. Once I figured that out, I bought a $60 inflatable mattress, surrounded it in powder and about 6 months later, I no longer had a bed bug problem.

As a side note, I also noticed that the inflatable mattress would heat up over night from my body heat and I think that may have also helped with masking my heat, but I cant be 100% sure.

There are other options, but my method killed them for about $100. There are companies that can come and steam all of your things, but its not 100% guaranteed to get them all and costs about $2000+. There are also mattress sealers you can get, but the problem with just using those, is that if even a handful survive outside that sealer, they will just infect something else. They are as thin as credit cards, so they find ways to live in the walls, and inside everything else.

If anyone is dealing with them, feel free to ask me anything. Dont be ashamed either, Bed Bugs arent attracted to dirty people because they dont eat regular food, they arent looking for crumbs like other bugs do, they feed off of living things. You can be a clean freak and they will still try to live near you to feed off of you.

TL;DR

Lets be honest, if you have Bed Bugs, its worth taking your time to read the whole thing."

576,"Your story made me remember one of my own. Some people only want to hear what they want to hear. 

When I was 23, I was hospitalized for an episode of acute pancreatitis. My doctor at the time was convinced I was an alcoholic. At the hospital, he asked me to tell him about my drinking, I told him I didn’t drink (because I didn’t, I was always the DD, I don’t like drinking or feeling drunk). He sent my parents and Grandparents away and then said “now you can tell me the truth, how much are you drinking!!” I repeated the above, I don’t drink. He got all frustrated and left. 

The next few appointments, when I offered up explanations for why I was getting pancreatitis he belittled them and refused to listen to me or investigate further. When I asked how I could prevent another episode, he told me to eat carbs and stop drinking. No matter what I said, his solution was that I just needed to stop drinking. 

A year later I was hospitalized again for another episode of pancreatitis. This time I was in another city. I told the doctor that my family has a history of cystic fibrosis, that my uncle and multiple cousins have cystic fibrosis and pointed out the link between pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis. This doctor, unlike the first, listened to me and tested my dna for CF markers. Guess why I got pancreatitis? I have the CF markers in my dna and multiple CFTR related conditions. 

Take that bitch. I don’t drink. I was fucking right. I never saw the first doctor again, and I got everyone else in my family to see someone else too. "

604,"Interned at a local wedding magazine during college. Small office of three interns who put the mag together, with an editor who will always be the most incompetent person I’ve ever worked with. And I’ve worked in food!

Anyway, after months of petty bullshit, my car broke down over thanksgiving. I called the editor, letting her know just in case I was ever late showing up, as I planned to take the bus/bum rides. Her response? “Oh, your car broke down? You are no longer needed as an intern.” Click.

Bitch, you did not just hang up on me! I was mad, but I took that call as a blessing in disguise and decided to forget about it. We weren’t getting paid as interns, so who cares? Two months later, a Saturday, I’m relaxing at home when I get a call. Guess who?

“Hey OP! Listen, I’m sorry about that call during thanksgiving, my phone dropped it. We’re trying to get this month’s edition printed, and I can’t keep up with all the mail, ads and phone calls. It’s crazy here, and the other girls quit, can you believe that?? When will you be back in the office??”

Readers, it’s been four years since that Saturday, but even now I can still feel that incredible sense of petty joy. “You said I was no longer needed as an intern two months ago.

628,"I have a few, I fully believe something has been mimicking my mom for years.

One night I was sitting on the couch with my dog watching tv at around 10:30pm, when suddenly I heard my mom call from her bedroom, which is right across the hallway from the stairs leading to the backdoor. 
She said “come here and let the dog out” which I thought was odd because the dog was with me, I didn’t think much of it so I turned around and tried to get the dog to move and she wouldn’t budge off the couch at all. Just as I was about to reply back saying the dog clearly didn’t want to go outside, my eyes met the gaze of the orange streetlight outside, illuminating the empty driveway. 

Another time when I was still in high school, my best friend and I were on the bus heading back home, my friend nudged me pointing at a silver car pulled over on the side of the road, probably within 1-2 minutes from my house, a familiar looking decal was hanging from the rear view mirror and a woman was inside wearing a dark blue jacket with short curly brown hair, asking me if that was my mom. We both laughed because my mom is known for sitting in our driveway for up to 20 minutes on her phone before she comes through the door, so we both thought she couldn’t wait until she got home from work to check and we didn’t think much of it. As the bus passed by my house we both noticed my mom’s car was boxed in between my dad’s truck and my brothers’ cars, unable to move. 

Another day I was leaving my room to make some lunch when I heard my mom call to me from downstairs. At first I didn’t hear her so I moved closer to the steps and I hollered down to her asking her to repeat herself once more, she sounded off and was asking me to come down to help her with the laundry; something she’d never do. 
Just as I was about to place my foot on the top step, I remembered my mom telling me she was going to be home later in the evening and that I was completely alone.



Edit: to everyone mentioning it could be schizophrenia, explain why my friend(s) can see/hear it as well lol.

A friend and I use to take short road trips over to the coast when we were 18 or 19 years old.  One trip we decided to rent in-line skates and skate the boardwalk and then up to this lighthouse.  We were going along, having a great time, when all of the sudden I hit a pebble just right, causing the one skate to lock up as my other foot kept going.  Trying to save myself, I wrenched around causing my knee to scrap along the cement.  I managed to stand back up, but by this point there was too much momentum and no balance.  Both my feet went up in the air in a classic prat fall and I landed with a thud on my back.

My friend was in hysterics at this point.  She was laughing so hard she had to squat down so she wouldn’t fall, and was of no help to me.  I gingerly sat up, surveying my bleeding knee and elbows, yelling some choice words at my friend, and looked up to see a whole group of Japanese tourist stopped nearby and filming me in all my messed up glory.  Seeing me notice them, they promptly stopped filming and walked on.

Her kids had been taken away and I forget all the details now, but she basically just poured out her story to me while we waited and while we rode into town. I held one of her hands in both of mine. I asked a few questions, but mostly I just listened, because there was simply no resolution to her situation. It was just awful. I probably listened for a total of 20-30 minutes. 

Even while I was caring/listening, I'd been wondering ""how does this end,"" but when we got to the center of town, she thanked me for listening and got off the train. Some of the other riders made eye contact with me, knowing what I'd/we'd been through as we listened, but none of us spoke. It was silent and a profound experience for me--and for a few others who overheard. Whenever I think of her, I hope she's doing well. But I'll never know."

690,"I found out that my grandfather had a fairly large playing card collection (mostly casino decks from Vegas but also a few random others like a Jack Daniels deck and one of those military decks from Iraq with pics of Saddam Hussein on them). I found it in his house when we were cleaning it out after he passed a few years ago. 


The reason this is so shocking is because I'd been collecting playing cards myself since I was about 12 and had never known that we shared this interest until he passed away when I was 22. For 10 years we had a shared, somewhat obscure hobby, and neither of us had any idea. 


I now have all of the cards we found in his house (basically doubled my collection at the time; I offered to share but nobody else in the family had any interest in them) but it makes me really sad to think that we never got the chance to talk about it. If there's any sort of afterlife I hope he sees that his collection went to a good home where it can be fully appreciated.

We number in the billions. We exist on every continent on Earth. We are extremely adaptable to the degree that we can completely change our environment to suit our needs.

During our last day there we went to a restaurant right across the street from our hotel and sat outside and enjoyed some drinks and some really great live music from a musician who I sadly can't remember the name of.  

The dude sounded like Jack Johnson but looked like Jason Momoa, no joke he was talented as hell too.  

Anyway right before our drinks arrive the musician comes back from a short break and sits down to play some more.  Seconds after sitting down this huge tree branch falls *right where he had been standing* during his break.  

The musician and I locked eyes and then we both started laughing.  My wife was actually embarrassed but I didn't care.  Not sure sure if anyone else saw what happened because no one moved or said anything other than the musician and I.

766,"Story time!

So back when I was younger I was ~~kind of~~ a terrible kid. To deal with being just totally unmanageable as well as being a child of two narcissist  the decision was made that I would work on a huge ranch deep into the sticks of Arizona (should be noted I was a pretty accomplished equestrian  rider at this time so ranching wasn't really out of the realm of what I could do) . There where some actually really good things to come of this but I digress. On cattle drives it was not unusual to stumble upon houses, encampments and even whole towns in also in the middle of nowhere. These all had  their own movie like situations that came out of them but one in particular I will NEVER forget.

Here we are on another cattle drive this time pretty far into it, we have been out in the desert if I remember correctly easily three or  or more weeks when we stumble upon this town in the middle of a canyon that is picture perfect in addition  low and behold there is a diner. Like an old totally chromed out east coast diner. We have not eaten anything really of substance for a while and the head wrangler promised me a milkshake for my birthday. I was beyond stoked if not a little weirded out but honestly after you spend enough time in wilderness of the US nothing really surprised me.

So we leave behind some of our mates to watch the cattle who are resting in the shade after getting over this rocky wash and hike into the canyon to go to the diner. The second we set foot in the diner the head guy , this older cowboy who is the head of all of us grabs my arm.  This place is packed and everyone is wearing odd clothing like stuff from maybe the 40s or 50s? My head wrangler (T) is a really tough guy who from ranching for his entire life had defiantly seen some shit. T grabs my arm (as I am just focused on milkshake and about to go grab a booth) when I realize everyone is just staring at us and there is a really strange feeling in the air. Now we where used to getting looks all the time from being smelly and dirty but these people had these almost fear and/or shock . T and the two others with us slowly backs out of the diner dragging me in tow and we immediately go back to our site and leave without a word. I was so confused I just went along with all of it.

To this day I have no idea what that place was or if we stumbled through a time warp or what but my wrangler told me later that night when we where away from them that he felt like we had stepped back in time. Like truly stepped back in time and that place was stuck in some sort of loop and if we stayed we would get stuck too. T never really spoke a lot , nor was he to be messed with , he also had a mean sweet tooth despite having almost no teeth so for him to have reacted that way really shook me.

I have no idea if what he told me is true (they where pretty rough guys who definitely teased and pulled pranks) but I will never forget the look of all those people in that immaculate diner.

793,"""We have a 10-30 in progress at the corner of Sycamore Street""

Officer John Simmons picked up the police radio and clicked the button ""Acknowledged, we'll check it out""

Simmons hit the car horn and waited for his partner, Mike Crosby, to finish his bathroom break at the side of the road and get back in the car.

""C'mon man, hurry up, we gotta go,"" said Simmons.

Crosby, ten years younger than Simmons struggled with his zipper as he made his way to the passenger side.

""What have we got?"" Crosby said, finally fixing his pants and pulling the seatbelt around his shoulder.

""Dispatch says we've got an accident. Some kind of attack""

""Terrorists?""

""Fucked if I know""

""I guess we'll know soon enough.""

""And here I was hoping it'd be a quiet night.""

The police car raced through the streets, red and blue siren blasting from the vehicle, as the two cops neared the scene of the accident. 

As they got close, Crosby switched off the siren and turned on the flashlight. Simmons brought the car to a crawl as the two officers surveyed the scene. It looked like any ordinary street, empty, but that was to be expected at this time of night. 

The only thing that looked out of place was a car sat in the middle of the street. the driver side door was open, and what looked like blood was dripping from the metal and interior.

Simmons gave Crosby a look of concern and both officers clicked the safety off on their guns. 

Slowly, they got out of the police car and moved towards the vehicle. Crosby moved to the driver side, carefully checking to see if anyone was inside. 

Nothing. It was empty. 

Simmons reached for his radio ""Dispatch we're at the scene, we're going to...""

Suddenly, Simmons saw movement behind his partner. it was small and skin colored, moving fast. 

Simmons opened his mouth to warn his partner, but it was too quick. The thing leaped onto his face, spewing caustic liquid into Crosby's face. The younger man, wide-eyed in terror, only had time to give a gurgled scream before his face was gone. consumed by the acid.

Simmons yelled, firing his gun at the creature as Crosby's body dropped. 

He looked around, and for the first time noticed more of the strange things. there were so many. and for the first time, it struck him how much they looked like... no.. they couldn't be... 

Simmons raced back to the police cruiser, slamming the door and hitting the radio. 

""Emergency, Officer down, repeat, officer down.""

He looked up as he felt something jump onto the front of the car. 

A small pink vagina seemed to stare back at him. it was hairy at the back and the vulva shivered as it seemed to be feeling for him. 

Simmons stared back as several more vaginas leaped up at the car, as more and more surrounded him. 

Then, one pressed against the glass of the windscreen. spraying its toxic vomit onto the car. The metal hissed and the glass cracked as the gooey slime quickly ate through to the inside. 

It was only a matter of time before they would get in. 

Simmons put the barrel of the pistol to his head.

824,"Wellllll at my old job at a supermarket, there was a relationship between a manager and a cashier.

Manager(technically front end coordinator), lets call him Dick, uses the company system to look up a cashier's information to stalk the shit out of her social media. Dick is 1 level above all the cashiers. We will call this cashier Girl. So Dick is a bit of a creeper and eventually adds girl on facebook to start messaging. Girl, I guess finds Dick somewhat attractive enough to go out on a date with. They go on a few dates and kiss, hook up, and its going fine but Dick steps it up with the creepiness and DROPS THE L BOMB two weeks into when they first started talking. 

Girl gets creeped out and refuses to say it back for a little bit. Girl also tells Dick multiple times she is not looking for anything serious because life and she is leaving for college soon. Girl specifically says ""I do not want a boyfriend"" and Dick says ""I know."" A day later two other managers(one level above Girl) say ""heyyyyy I heard you are Dick's girlfriend"" and she gets teased and is annoyed. Girl is unhappy but continues to see Dick because she doesnt know how to end it without it affecting her job. Dick becomes more possessive and schedules Girl every time he is scheduled, calls her every night, says ""I love you' every conversation. Refuses to meet up at places, picks her up and drives her wherever. Shows up to the apartment building she lives in to surprise her. Generally, creepy possessive person.


Finally, a month into the mayhem girl is pressured to say ""I love you"" and does, while Dick is a Dick. Girl leaves for college about a week later. Dick calls her everynight and gets mad when girl goes to a party or hangs out in a group with a male. Girl stops talking to Dick and blocks his number. Girl gets Dick out of her mind and starts to date a guy she met. Girl gets a call from a restricted number and its Dick who is drunk and says he is sorry but he is unable to surprise visit in a month. Also, he is a father of a kid he originally claimed was a nephew. Girl hangs up, continues the date she is on and pretends Dick doesnt exist. Next day Dick gets angry and messages on every social media platform and blocks Girl so she cant respond to the messages. 
When girl comes back from college, girl quits cashier job and gets a better job. 

Tl;dr - Manager is a creep and makes a girl his girlfriend without the girl wanting to be his girlfriend and the girl eventually quits."

Me: ""Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeh...""

Mom:""So, yes I agree she come sleep at home but I'm gonna buy you condoms""

I had a grade 9 science class in, and it somehow came up that they would be going to my cousins' class immediately after mine.  My cousin and I are practically brothers, and have always enjoyed pranking each other.  

About halfway through the class, I noticed that there was a kid sitting towards the back who had a limp red balloon hanging from his mouth.  Wasn't a big deal at all, until after a while, he'd blow it up a little bit, and then slowly [let the air out in this nature](https://youtu.be/RjDOUj9tVrw?t=4m8s).  

I walk over to him and confiscate it.  About 30 seconds later, I hear the noise again.  Different balloon, but same result.  Look up again about a minute later... green.  

""Alright bud, that's enough.  How many more balloons have you got?""  

""I dunno, a couple?"" he answers, looking down to the floor, where has backpack lay, open.  I looked down and saw that his backpack was stuffed full of empty balloons.  Stuffed.  Every pocket full.  Couldn't even close the main part.  If I had to guess, there were well over a thousand balloons in his bag.  

I told him that I was taking his giant selection of balloons for the duration of the class, but that as long as he promised to do the exact same thing to my cousin next class, that I would ensure that he wouldn't get in any trouble."

My grandfather was a heavy smoker and my mom would often smell cigarette smoke in the house despite no one smoking (my deceased grandfather never lived in this house). Similarly, when we first moved into the house, one night my mom heard and saw the camera sitting on the dresser flash and take a photo. My mom assumed it was my dad taking a picture of us but in the morning there was no photo and my dad said he never woke up. My mom attributed it to my grandfather capturing the moment.

Edit: I guess this isn’t common knowledge? In order to determine pneumonia we need to be able to take chest rads to see if the area surrounding the heart and the area inside the lungs are free of any “cloudiness” or clusters that would generally make it difficult to see the heart/lungs. When someone takes rads of your chest the heart and lungs are visible as well as the rib cage, spine, various dense bones.

Social worker here who spent two years with a family as their support worker.
I suspected munchausen by proxy as kids were constantly sick. 
Trouble is, no one believed me or should I say could do anything because all sicknesses had been diagnosed by doctors. She was constantly at doctors so from a child protection perspective it was hard to find cause of neglect which would’ve then allowed an investigation and a mandatory psych evaluation.
The most telling feature was that she thrived when she would tell me that her kids are sick. This weird, almost grinning/smirking face when she’d tell me that doctors told her her child is suffering from ... whatever it was. 
I always felt uneasy. 
In hindsight, I had to watch three kids suffer through so much medical intervention. 
-so above I said diagnosed by doctor... this is because the children arrive with presenting issues. Something that she was able to manipulate. 

It all came to blows when her last child was born early and stayed in hospital for a bit. A month tops. 
Baby was tiny but healthy. No issues when she left.
Next week baby has respiratory issues, allergies (like older sibling) 
This launched a report of concern.
They investigated and interviewed oldest child
(Age 6, adhd, speech impediment)
The right questions were asked which ended with the kids being removed and put into an alternative family member’s care.
The kids went from weekly doctor visits to almost nothing.
Child who was allergic to peanuts and dairy wasn’t actually. 
Baby didn’t suffer another respiratory issue. 
It was crazy how this is really unchartered territory.
In my job you have to prove neglect or abuse before more action can be taken...
But how do you do that when a mother takes her kids to the doctors? Hospital? Presenting your kids and telling an Oncall doctor with no notes that your child has allergies they just have to note that and believe a mother coz why would she lie about it right?

I also loved the scene at the end in Dumbledore's office. It made me cry during my last read through.     
I actually kind of wish that in TDH they had focused more on the PTSD/the fact that Harry really only gets through things post-Dumbledore's death by powering through robotically. I wish they'd shown him somewhat returning to normalcy, with all of the emotional implications. "

974,"&gt;Dear Michael,

&gt;Every year I attempt to boost my students' final grades by giving them this relatively simple exam consisting of 100 True/False questions from only 3 chapters of material. For the past 20 years that I have taught Intro Communications 101 at this institution I have never once seen someone score below a 65 on this exam. Consequently, your score of a zero is the first in history and ultimately brought the entire class average down a whole 8 points.

&gt;There were two possible answer choices: A (True)and B (False). You chose C for all 100 questions in an obvious attempt to get lucky with a least a quarter of the answers. It's as if you didn't look at a single question. Unfortunately, this brings your final grade in this class to failing. See you next year!

&gt;May God have mercy on your soul.

&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;Professor William Turner

&gt;P.S. If all else fails, go with B from now on.
B is the new C"

I just had no idea what heroin even was at the time and it’s scary to think someone could have been dying right in front of me and I would have never really known because you know, he had “narcolepsy”.

1153,"I dated someone who was very wealthy and had a huge family, lots of cars, properties, old family money. When I first met him, I had no clue that he was wealthy because he’s just a good, sweet country boy. As the time went on I realized the mental toll it took on him (he’s in line to take over the family business) . He worried all of the time whether or not people were just using him and he had a lot of paranoia. Also, since the family is so big and they all have a lot of money from family businesses and everything is intertwined , there is ALOT of family drama. One time my ex started freaking out because his dad was at a car show and owned not only one collectible car (like everyone thought), but two, and I snapchatted it and had to instantly take it down because his family saw it and were asking all of these questions and were super pissed. They lied their way out of it and honestly I feel like there were just so many secrets. I love them all dearly to this day, but it just made me so sad. Just the other day my ex said something to me about how he would’ve bought me all the diamonds in the world and I replied back about how all I wanted was his love and his time , and I would’ve lived in a shack with him if it meant we could’ve worked out. 

Anyways .. wealth does things to people and after that whole experience I can see why it’s sometimes viewed as “the root of all evil”.  That’s a little dramatic , but still.

What she received, instead of pad thai, instead of any variation of noodles with peanut sauce, was a takeout container of cold buckwheat noodles and a dollop of peanut butter.

* Learn to accept and admit when you're wrong, and don't lord it over them when you're right.

* When it costs you nothing, put their needs above yours.

* Treat them sometimes. Just because.

* Take turns choosing the restaurant/what to cook/what movie to watch/trip destination.

* Divide the chores based on who hates doing that task the least.

* Tell them when you're not feeling well. If you're not getting better and they say ""Maybe you should go to the doctor"", then go. 

* Learn to let things go, but also be firm if some ongoing behavior is causing resentment. And if they bring your behavior up to you, hear them out. 

* Let them laugh at you when you goof up, so you get to laugh at them when they do.

1242,"Incoming gory story:

When I was about 5, I lived around the corner from an intersection that was notorious for accidents. The house on the corner had a car go through the fence in to the house, 3 times that I remember. That's how bad.

So one day my mom makes me a peanut butter sandwich, and as she gives it to me we hear another accident happen, but it sounded like multiple cars. My dad worked in EMS, and my mom called him to send out vehicles. She needed to go check how bad it was, to see if she could help anybody, and then if my dad needed to dispatch helicopters or more ambulances, and she took me with because she couldn't leave me alone at home. This was way before cellphones were around.

We took the quick walk, and I'm still holding on to my sandwich. Three cars and a motorbike. I don't know what happened, but the first thing I saw was a woman, halfway out of the passenger side windscreen. Her body didn't manage to go all the way through it, and she was stuck around her hips. Blood dripping around her. There was a small(ish) hole on the driver's side too. A second woman was lying further down, clearly the driver and clearly dead. She was kind of smeared along the road, but on the opposite side to me. There was obviously a lot of commotion happening, and it took a while for me to process the worst of it.

I was standing on the curb, and looked down to see this red thick juice slowly making its way down the side of the road. Some of it was coming from the woman in the windshield. Most of it was coming from the guy who had been on the motorcycle. He hadn't been wearing a helmet, and his body was folded perfectly in half at the waste, head not visible to me because it was in between his legs, which were sticking out funny. It's good I couldn't see his head, because that's where most of the blood was coming from.

I stood on the curb eating my peanut butter sandwich, looking at this in utter fascination. I didn't realise you could lose so much blood. I didn't understand the concept of death either.

Thinking back, I don't think it was a traumatic experience. My parents explained things carefully to me afterwards, and I was okay with it. Now if I witness a bad accident, I don't freak out like some other people do. I do what I can to help and make sure EMS is called.

**Shout out to everybody who works in EMS. You guys save lives, and deserve more recognition.**

TL;DR: Buckle your fucking seatbelts and wear helmets, or some 5 year old is gonna be eating a sammich watching your blood run down the drain."
1243,"There are a lot.

But one of the bigger ones was that I thought it was normal and necessary that she beat me, even though I was aware that not all parents hit their kids and that “child abuse” was a bad thing. She had me convinced from a very young age that I deserved/needed to be beat up. She also made me 100% believe that when she did it she was going easy on me, and that if I ever told anyone she was hitting me, they’d know that I needed to be hit, and they’d beat me worse than she did. Now, of course, it seems inane that I ever believed that, but she controlled my reality from birth and meticulously crafted a warped system of beliefs.  When I was about 13 I began to have my doubts about this. I told several people that she was hitting me. They all told me I was a liar, but none of them attacked me like she’d always said they would, and that’s when I started unraveling that thread of my warped reality. 

Her drug habit is another one. I thought everyone’s mom took a shit ton of pills and passed out on the couch. It didn’t help that ambien and lunesta were very much a thing at the time, and so “sleeping pills” were normalized. 

She forced me to sleep in the same bed with her until I was a teenager. I thought this was normal until I heard her telling her friends about it and claiming that she was “trying so hard to break me of the habit”. I piped up and said “oh, mom! I misunderstood I guess! I thought you always said I had to sleep in your room for safety! I’d be fine sleeping in my room!” She acted pleased but skeptical in front of her friend. When we got home she still insisted I sleep in her bed with her, and when I asked why she’d told her friend she didn’t want me to she told me that she’d changed her mind. I overheard her having the same conversation a week later, and when I brought it up to her again she beat the shit out of me.

1268,"Pause a few seconds before entering an intersection.

Where I grew up, people run red lights *all the time.* I’m sure everywhere it’s a problem, but growing up my parents really impressed upon me to wait a few seconds before going into an intersection, in case someone is planning to run the light - especially at night or in the early morning. 

This just came in handy a few weeks ago when I was coming home from a friends house at 2am and I was pausing for a few seconds after my light turned green, when a car blew through the red light and turned left onto the road I was coming from. If I hadn’t waited I would have put myself and my passengers in the middle of the intersection right at that moment. And my car doesn’t have side airbags, and my seatbelt is all loose...so...it would have been bad.

I know when you’re driving behind someone and maybe in a rush it sucks to have to wait, but to me it’s a few seconds that could change your life, so why not take a few moments to make sure it’s clear. Or maybe don’t run red lights.

1275,"Worked at a small law firm as a ""contractor"" (probably to prevent the firm from paying taxes, offering benefits, paying unemployment, etc). Got a new case assigned to me on my own one afternoon. The next day, the boss has a staff meeting.

He proceeds to ask me every detail about my new case, like various deadlines and details. I hadn't gotten much into that stuff yet due to other cases taking priority, so I say some form of ""I don't know offhand"" or  ""I'll have to look that up."" The boss laughs at me and berates me in front of the whole team.

The next workday, I wasn't in for the morning due to a (fortunate) gas leak in my car. Boss demands that I take an uber in to the office and provide documenting for the car work. Instead, I talk to a family friend that practices employment law. I would almost certainly be legally considered an ""employee"" not a ""contractor"", so I would get unemployment as long as I didn't quit, but got fired. 

I sent the boss an email, saying ""since I'm a contractor, I'd like to work from home. I'll send you a bill for my time at $xx per hour."" Boss replied, saying ""No, you're no longer needed.""

Filed with unemployment, they initially denied my claim. I appealed, and provided all documentation I had for the whole occurrence. The investigator found that I had been an employee and was fired. My claim denial was overturned, and the boss paid my unemployment until I got myself a much better job.

1315,"If they sell steak, but won't cook it rare.   

If they're doing this, it's most likely because they're unsafe, because they're selling frankensteak, meat assembled with meat glue to reassemble more expensive cuts.   

You can eat rare steak because the fibers are dense enough to not allow bacteria to penetrate deeply, so a sear is enough to make a steak safe. This is the same reason you need to fully cook chicken, because the fibers are all fluffy, and let bacteria really get in there. But, if you've made frankensteak, you're incorporating external surfaces into the interior of the cut, which can't be properly cooked at anything short of medium well. So, if they refuse to cook a steak rare, I refuse to eat there, because it's very strongly indicative of shady business practices.   

It goes without saying, don't order rare steak from someplace you suspect would do this and wouldn't care of you got sick, but if they're worried you might get sick from a rare steak, don't order a steak there at all."

1367,"I no longer work there (left on my own), but my last job I lied my ass off. I got tired of the hard work angle, and I know I have the ability and drive to back it, so I just wanted to make it easier.

It started day zero, in my resume. I said that at my last job I was a manager, put references, etc. That was the first lie. I was never manager. Then it came up in the interview obviously, since I was applying for manager at this new place. I was just bluffing, hoping they would never check my references. They didn't, and I got the job. I thought it was over, but I had to maintain the lie. This was hard for me because I'm typically not a liar, but I wound up getting promoted to a higher level manager and they wanted me to give specific examples of situations I was in in my previous position AND current one, and how I handled them. I bullshitted through that, and got the promotion. I got moved to another store with my new position, and people heard all these stories how I passed with better scores than anyone else going for that promotion, and I became a training manager. I now had to train lesser experienced managers how to be like me (or like how I told them I was). It started to hit me because I was training people twice my age who worked there their entire lives, and I was their boss. So I trained them and did my duties, but it came time for another promotion, so I said ""can't stop now"" and went for that. This was a higher level leader/manager role that required certifications and a classroom like, 12 week training course. While there I made friends, told stories, and in turn had to create even more lies. There were 3 people chosen out of the 20-25 people in that class to be promoted, and I was one of them. They ""loved my enthusiasm"" and my knowledge and leadership skills. I loved the fact that they believed that. Due to the direction of the company I decided to leave before it was too late. I already hated that job, so I felt like I had nothing to lose taking the risk of getting caught in the lies, but if I would have taken that next promotion I would have been miserable, but stayed for the good pay, and be stuck in a perpetual rotation of depression followed by 5 minutes of happiness when I see my check. That place mentally drained me and I just had to leave. The best part is this all happened in 2.5 years. I bypassed people who were there for 15+ years!

In a way I was actually a good manager, and people loved me, but you have to exaggerate the truth to get noticed. Just doing well isn't good enough. My success was about 50% bullshit, and 50% good employee. Without the bullshit, being a good employee wouldn't have been good enough, and without being a good employee I would have nothing to back up the bullshit.

The whole time I was afraid of someone finding out something at some point, but luckily it never happened. I only told one person, and it was one of the people I was training that I grew to trust. She had potential to be just like me, I saw it in her work ethic and pride, but she didn't have it in her to bullshither way up. I told her this story, with the actual details, as a way to inspire her. I wanted her to do well, and she did. She wound up applying somewhere else for a higher position using my ""techniques"" , and I told her for good measure she could put me as a reference to back her up, but they won't use it. They never did, she got the job, and we both laughed about it. Life is as easy or difficult as you make it.

**TLDR**: Bullshitted my way into 2 promotions, bypassed years of hard work. "

1386,"Prelude: I had been at a Baywatch theme party, where I had been dressed up as Pamela Anderson (important info: am guy). I had gotten extremely drunk and the swimsuit I had borrowed from my friend was definitely not suited for male genitalia so my chimichangas would make their escape at a frequent rate. Not long after all the Baywatch themed party games had adhered, the actual party started and I was beyond single and beyond ready to mingle! Less than ten minutes later I'm finding myself in a taxi headed to my place with a girl, who obviously had a thing for swimsuit-wearing men with gorgeous blonde wigs.

Not long after entering my apartment we are both naked going at it in my bed. And we're both going hard - as hard as only people with a near lethal potency can go. Naturally I have to solidify my otherwise well-hidden masculinity, so I decide that I'm going to toss her from a missionary position and up so that she is now sitting on me, facing me. Except the horniness and intoxication has turned out to give me super human strength - I witness this as I toss her up over my body, out of my bed, and half way across the room right onto my aluminum trashbin that just deforms completely as this poor girls body unwillingly had turned into a ballistic projectile.

It takes me a second to realize just what happened, and in doing so I apologetically come to her rescue whilst unable to stop laughing. Thankfully she was fine, so after a few laughs and mutual confusion over what I just did we went back to sexing. Which was really good sex btw.

For example lets say you make 5 purchases of various size, have $5 left in your account but you think ""my paycheck goes through at midnight and these are all credit purchases which are not instant"" so you have a spendy meal. The bank's software then triggers saying ""ok, since there are enough pending items to put this is the negative, lets run them all starting with the largest"" so you end up with 2 or 3 overdrafts not 1. I also caught them changing something from ""completed"" to ""pending"" but its been well over a decade and I dropped them soon after that stunt anyways. 

tl;dr they did (and may still) do everything in their legal power in order to maximize overdraft fees, some of which may actually not be legal, and is certainly not ethical."
1434,"Similar story, except I was the shoulder and there weren't tears or a rollover. 

I was driving home from work one morning (worked overnights at the time) and the weather was getting a bit sketchy. It was snowing, 32°F (0°C for those of you who use Celsius) and I was holding a good 35-40 MPH (~56-65 KPH) in the slow lane. I catch sight of an SUV doing minimum 65 MPH (~105 KPH) in the fast lane on a three or four lane highway. Albeit that's the speed limit but given the conditions...

Anyway, I told myself ""they're going to get into an accident when they hit a bridge and find the ice."" I didn't think I'd actually see anything of it. Not even half a mile (~.8 KM) down the road, the same SUV is fishtailing and they slam into the median wall. The passenger is out of the vehicle almost immediately and flagging people down, and I was already slowing down to assist if I could. Several other people pulled over as well. Airbags had deployed and they were a little cut up and bleeding, but overall to my unknowing eyes looked okay. They were aware and responding to the people around them.

I immediately went to the passenger and asked if they were okay and she said they weren't. she asked if she could lean on me because she didn't feel steady, to which I said yes. Once she let go (30 seconds I think?) I asked if they wanted me to call emergency services. She said yes so I told her help would be on the way soon and proceeded to get the best info I could as to our current location while calling 911. Five minutes later the paramedics, police and firefighters arrived. I never spoke to them again, provided my witness testimony to the officer, and went on my way after getting back into my car with the help of the firefighters, as I had locked my keys in my car in my haste to assist the people who were in the accident. 

I never knew their names, but I hope they're doing well.

1447,"Late at night I had just dropped a buddy off at home and pulled off onto a side street. I guess i fell asleep at the wheel because the next thing i remembered was a tree that i swerved to avoid which caused me to pop over a flower bed almost ramming through the house and inches away from a circuit breaker. Called my friend because he had a truck, he came over and there was just no way we were getting it out. I had knocked on the house several times and had prepared a note with all my details to leave behind just in case there was damages we couldn't see. 

Some time later a car pulls up to the driveway that looks like it goes to that house. We approach the car, thinking it was the homeowner. Guy comes out immediately with a handgun pointed at us. Immediately our hands go up, we completely stop moving and my much more used to crazy stuff friends takes over and explains what had happened and why we we approaching them in the middle of the night. Guy was cool afterwards, apologized and explained that he was just so paranoid because his pregnant girlfriend was with him and he didn't want trouble. 

We chat while the cops come to tow my car and take me home. I didn't really freak out, was just at a loss for words. There was really no recovery from it. I wasn't stressed over that at all, only at totaling my car. I don't blame the guy for it. I mean I'm a stocky guy and my friend is over six foot and was in pretty good shape. Not something I'd want approaching me at 3am with my pregnant girlfriend with me. "

1515,"In tennis they play sets of games where to win a set, it's (simplified) first to 6 games win by 2 (there's some other rules here that I'm skipping for simplicity of explainiton). For men's tennis it's a best 3 out of 5 sets to win the match and move on in the tournament.

Now, sometimes the 5th set is special, mostly in the largest tournaments. In other sets if you're tied at 6 games to 6, you play a tiebreaker of just a few points to give you the win in the set, rather than playing an additional game. But in the 5th set in some larger tournaments (like Wimbledon mentioned above) , there is no tiebreaker, you have to win the set by having a 2 game lead over your opponent after you've win 6 games. So if you win 6 games and your opponent has won 4, you win the match. But if your opponent has won 5 games, now you need to win 7 to win the match. This goes on forever until someone wins by two. So you could theoretically go 6-5, 6-6, 7-6, 7-7, 8-7, 8-8, etc forever.

A normal 5 set match in tennis can take a very long time, anywhere from 3-5+ hours. In the mentioned match, they played for over 12 hours over 3 days. Eventually with the Victor winning 70 games to 68. So these two guys were one game apart for over 8 hours. "

1587,"There is a scene in *Lost World* where Ian, Sarah, Nick, and Kelly come to the long grass and Ian hears a velociraptor growl.

He recognizes it.

The thing is, he shouldn't.

In the first film, Malcom only ever sees the velociraptors when the group meets Muldoon right before feeding time, and they don't make that sound. 

The reason Malcom recognizes the sound is because in the original Michael Crichton novel, velociraptors break into the control room where Malcolm is recuperating from his injury from the T-rex escape (also, Malcolm was heavily dosed on morphine for parts of the novel and I seem to recall that he needed a cane in the sequel, but it has admittedly been sometime since I read the novels.)

Their tech was good but seriously outdated.  The market had passed them by and they didn't even know it.

Because you know who else is an asshole that would be a nightmare to live next to? Squidward. Imagine waking up at 7am on Saturday to what sounds like a cat being tortured to death slowly in an acid pit. Because that’s what Squidwards clarinet playing sounds like. And he refuses to improve because he’s a narcissist that thinks he’s perfect. 

Or imagine going to take out the trash and Squidward walks up to you and shows you his latest art piece. Now, his art isn’t terrible, but it’s all so self centered. All of it is about him and functionally worthless as an art piece because there’s nothing to it. It’s all “look at me, I’m Squidward, bathe in my magnificence.” There’s no deeper meaning, there’s no profound statements made, nothing. It’s all self-congratulatory wank.

1658,"I thought it was just nostalgia goggles, but I saw a vid explaining a study that analyzed Top of the Charts music from the last several decades, and found that popular songs have become less varied in melody, have more compression to artificially make them sound ""louder,"" have earlier and more frequent ""hooks,"" and are more similar to other recent top songs.  Some of their theorized reasons for these trends:  

1.  Nowadays many top artists' songs are written by the same 2 or 3 people instead of by themselves or other ""non pro"" writers

2.  Sponsoring a new artist is significantly more expensive compared to even 20 years ago, so there's more economic risk to record labels in taking in non-cookiecutter artists

3.  When a new artist and song is sponsored, they repeat said song ad nauseum.  Just think about it, there's likely at least one case where you heard a popular song and initially though it was stupid, but eventually warmed up to it since you heard it EVERYWHERE.  In movies, advertisements, multiple times per hour on the radio, etc.  It's basically mental conditioning to like the song, as opposed to finding truly *good* songs that leave people enthralled after only playing it once."

I camped a lot and liked the woods so it never really bothered me till one day. We were coming back from our afternoon hike and I was a the back of the line of maybe 50 kids. While walking up the the hill I looked the down the hill to see a shadowy figure in a full black torn cloak arms up and coming up this steep hill through brush at speeds way faster than human could traverse. I instantly ran to front of the group near a consuelor with a panicked expression on my face and before I could say anything to any group leader I looked back and what ever I’d seen had disappeared into thin air.

Get to the pick-up and they have to put my card on file on site in case of any damage. Cool, no problem. Except my card only had like a hundred bucks on it at the time. So the guy denied me my car I had already paid for.

Alright whatever, we can put it on my brother's card right, no big deal? Just swap the reservation to his name, he's over 25 and it's already paid for. Nope, can't do that. Have to cancel the reservation and do it from scratch in his name.

Oh wait, we can't do that either. Because there are no available vehicles, since you already rented the last one and cancelling it doesn't put it right back into our system. Doesn't matter that the car is literally 20 feet away and you already paid, you have to call customer service.

So I call customer service and naturally I get some guy in India who barely speaks English, but somehow his name is David? Oh and he hangs up on me when I ask for a Supervisor after he explains that he can't reserve the car since it has already been reserved. By me. 

First time I've *ever* cussed somebody out face to face like I did, and finally managed to get it cancelled and reserved again. Except now the rate isn't the same and it costs twice as much on my brother's card.

It's been a month and I still haven't been refunded the 100 bucks that was supposed to take 3-5 business days from my initial reservation.

So yeah, I know which rental company I will *never* be using again."

To this day I wish I was an adult and I could go back and run the other half over and put it out of its misery. It’s face, it’s screams. It still makes me want to scream and scream. "

1756,"Slightly unrelated: There was a early 40's pastor in the area I used to live in. He was weird, but no diddling. The parish had a lot of old, poor people. I was pretty staunchly anti-religious since my early teens, so I only had one interaction with him, when he visited our house when I was around 13-14 or so. He was weird, but no diddling.

He swindled an old man out of tens of thousands of euros (The pastor suggested himself as an intermediary to sell some inherited land) and got removed from the parish. There were more victims, but this one was the most substantial one. I think he got prison time for it as well. There was a rumor that he had hung himself in prison, but recently I dug up an article where he is still alive and claims he did nothing wrong. The old man had died since the incident and he's yet to pay any of the money.

It's no where near as bad as kiddie diddling, but abusing your position of trust and screwing the elderly out of their money is also despicable. 
A few years later my grandmother gave away a lot of her money to a prayer radio station in the hopes of ""getting in to heaven"" since her son-in-law (my father) and myself ""do not believe in Jesus"". She was not rich by any measure and probably just wants to feel like a martyr (we tried offering her any and all ways of helping, she spitefully refuses every single time).

These two cases, in conjunction to all the kiddie diddling that's surfaced over the years, have left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth when it comes to religion, especially the catholic church.

I don't even want to know how much I wasted on him, I'm just glad to be rid of him.

And because everyone asks...I paid his car insurance and bills so he wouldn't have an excuse to not look for work. I paid for groceries because I still had to eat - he was responsible for anything he wanted that I didn't eat. And I paid the rent because my landlady was so sweet and kind, and I didn't want her or her family to suffer because my shitty ex didn't feel like paying his half that month."

There was no hostess or waiters around so my SO and I stood there for a while waiting to be seated and wondering what to do. We thought maybe they were in the back or something and they'd be out shortly.
About 5 minutes later, the woman in the booth stands up, wipes her mouth with a napkin, and then grabs 2 menus, walks over to us and says ""Table for 2?"". 

I think when you have to wait for the waitress to finish dining before you're served, that's a bad sign. Also it unsurprisingly was total shit food and for too much money. One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. BEWARE HAPPY DRAGON!

1790,"Not a teacher but a student. A teacher found a hand grenade in my lunch box when I was in elementary school. Don't worry! It wasn't real, it was one of those hollowed out grenades you could find at army surplus back in the nineties. Totally harmless.

I had brought it in for show and tell thinking it was a good idea, not once taking into account that columbine had happened recently (I wAs young enough not to know about that I guess). Luckily, a teacher found it before I had a chance to put on my show. My young mind thought it would be the most badass thing ever to get up in front of my class during show and tell, extract a frag grenade from my pocket, pull the pin, let the little floppy thing fly away, and then, for some reason, TOSS THE GRENADE INTO MY CLASSROOM. Crazy right?

Before I could do all that though (thank god), I carelessly left my lunchbox in the cafeteria before class. A teacher or cafeteria worker, or someone, found my lunch right where I left it, and in an attempt to find a name of the owner, opened my lunch and found a grenade sitting next to my banana and boost energy bar. Obviously this person shit a brick and reported it immediately. Cops got called, parents got called, it was crazy.

While all that was happening, I was in class freaking the fuck out because it was almost my turn and I couldn't find my lunchbox. I COULDNT FIND MY FUCKING LUNCHBOX. I had no backup routine. Nothing. I had spent all night coming up with that master showmanship And then I lost my lunchbox.

At some point while I was sweating bullets, I remember hearing my name called over the loudspeaker telling me to come to the front office. I was thinking, ""damn straight, they found my lunchbox, bout to blow these kids minds when I get back."" I hauled ass to the office to get my shit and hurry back, but obviously I never made it back that day.

TLDR; teacher found a gutted hand grenade in my lunch when I was in elementary.

And the rules specifically state to post pictures that stand on their own without backstory. A rule that literally NEVER gets enforced because the mods are like “it’s too much work.” 

So /r/pics is a complete free for all. Shit I remember the time some guy posted a blurry dark picture of his feet next to his kids feet, with the title like “I know this pic doesnt seen important but it’s the first time I’ve seen my kids since prison.” 

/r/gaming is worse. Just a lot of generic repetitive pictures of either old N64 games (cause Nintendo is life and if you didn’t grow up with N64 you grew up wrong) with titles about finding it in the attic, or yet another Link fanart. "

1865,"Any on the Holocaust.  Doesn't matter, they're all equally disturbing and sad, and for anyone that tries to deny the Holocaust, just shut up and go away.

1867,"Unless the place specializes in gluten-free pizza, never order gluten-free crust. Aside from tasting ganky and having the consistency of burnt pita, it's not actually safe for Celiac Disease since the store itself literally has particles of gluten flying everywhere, defeating the purpose. Some places actually have to post disclaimers for this sort of thing."

1871,"The Victorian female protagonist who “isn’t like other women” because she hates corsets and rides horses astride.

1882,My kids were 7 and 4 and had been fighting all day. They usually slept together even though they had their own rooms. Finally around bedtime they are in a frenzy. I angrily sent them to bed and as they went my daughter loudly announced her brother wasn't allowed to sleep in her room. As I readied myself for bed I started down the hallway and had to stop. Their rooms were side by side. They each had lower half of body in their rooms and upper body out in the hall. It was as close as they could be together and still technically be in their own rooms.

1884,"Indie games are the last line of defense there, and I doubt they'll go down anytime soon. Many, many indie developers make games with *making good content* as their first priority and their passion, and happily accept money to make it a full-time thing rather than a part-time thing. There's surprisingly little greed in the indie scene, mostly just people doing their best to make others happy and stay on their own feet.

1896,"It would only be noticed if I spent them in sequential order and more than one at a time. Where I'm from you could go to any number of crappy gas stations that have probably never seen a hundred dollar bill and you would never be questioned. Places in the middle of nowhere.... And then you could go to the nicer part of town where they always say $100 bills and still wouldn't question you using one to purchase gas. 

Or I could use it to purchase weed.... I'm never spending more than $100 on that at a time."
1897,"Andy, trying to find his phone while the Rockin' Robin ring tone plays away, tries to open Phillys's desk drawer. When she holds it shut, Andy says, ""I don't trust you, Phyllis.""

1899,There was a group of teens playing mini-golf slow as hell ahead me and a buddy. They backed up like the next 4-5 groups. This mini golf course has a DJ who is also a magician to do tricks in that exact circumstance. He assumed me and this cute girl were dating and called us over and did couples magic tricks for us. We ended up going to Chili's after.
1900,"It's crazy how much talent was in the Freaks &amp; Geeks cast too. Shows like this... it's a bummer we didn't have streaming services and such back then, that would have been a huge hit.

If nothing else comes from streaming; even if we get to an a la carte system of a dozen services not much cheaper than cable was, I'm glad that the Nielsen dinosaur is being put out of its misery."
1901,"To be fair it was the most real episode about suicide in tv shows i ever seen.    
There is a new show that sort of glorified the idea of being depressed and bullied where girl wrote tapes for her friends - i could not watch it seriously after i've seen this HouseMD episode."
1902,"I'm a professional IT guy. 

Remember that call from that guy who doesn't get the difference between RAM memory size (yeah I know that's redundant) and his Hard Disk size? ""my computer has 8GB hard disk, can I install Office?"" and you were thinking ""god that's an idiot!""

So, one day I bought a new vacuum cleaner, picked one randomly off the shelf and went home. Fast forward the next weeks, I went to the shop to buy vacuum bags (yup that was years ago). 

I asked the guy where I can find them and he asks me ""what's your vacuum cleaner's model?"" 

Me: ""I don't remember the brand, but the model name printed on it was 60W!""

Him: ""Yeah... that's not the model, that's the power rating...""

I got the lesson and stopped being a presumptuous jerk that day."
1903,"I hate to be the pessimist, but it may also be due to a lack of sufficient dieting. OP mentioned he's trying to lose weight. Running is great for burning calories, but there's a saying that you can't outrun a bad diet. Unless you're running a LOT, the amount of calories you burn running is probably only going to be a small fraction of your daily caloric intake. 

Then if you over-compensate for the running by eating more, then it pretty much cancels out your weight loss progress, with the exception of the small metabolism boost you're getting, which isn't as much as people think."

1913,"I met my future husband on the first day of freshman year in university and there was instant attraction and awkward, nervous sexual tension between us.


 One day my roommate and I were being stupid and making up lies to tell people to see what we could get them to believe, like she told everyone she genetically had dwarfism but she was just really tall for a dwarf. (She's almost 6 foot) Then I told everyone that I was 14, I'd just skipped a couple grades and gotten into college early because I was so smart. 


Well, I totally forgot about it but word got around to my crush that I was a child genius and he backed right off. I thought we had something and one day all the sudden he's 100% hands off, not sitting close to me anymore, real polite and kind instead of flirty...

I was disappointed and confused until word got BACK around why he'd suddenly backed off (oh the joys of freshman gossip chain) and I made my friend ""accidently"" let the truth slip and then we were BACK ON and that's how I learnt my husband isn't a pedophile and the rest is history."
1914,"I wanted to kiss my anesthesiologist right on the mouth after he gave me that epidural. I told my husband I loved the anesthesiologist more than anyone else in the whole hospital, including said husband and that baby (still) inside me. I think I’d still kiss that guy if I saw him today.

1923,"Cousin got married to a douchebag who had cheated on her with 15 other women, and 2 guys, she had three kids, none of them his, although she was adamant they were (sorry but two pasty Irish White people do not a milk chocolate baby make)

the wedding was held in August...in a park...next to an algae covered pond...that housed seemingly the entire worlds population of mosquitoes and biting flies...

Also the food was 'vegan' and thus everything was made with either tofu, or some other soy product (because my cousin is a moron who thinks vegans only eat tofu) so i couldn't eat anything because i am allergic to soy... and she got pissed at me for not eating my dinner meal that cost her 45 fucking dollars for a plate with 3 items on kit.

When reminded i am allergic she asked me ""Would it kil lyou to do this one thing for me on my wedding day?""

Yes Tabby, it could very much kill me to eat Tofu, you saw that the last time you tricked me into a tofu burger and i spent 2 weeks in the ICU."
1924,"When you become the new hot act overnight just by adding a female to your group and changing to pop, don't be surprised when people forget about you just as quickly.

Funnily enough a few years ago they put out a track called 'Yesterday' (sans Fergie) which was kind of a love letter to 90s hip-hop, which made me laugh cos it reeked of them trying to regain some kind of credibility in hip-hop like the previous 10 years never happened."
1925,"You aren’t wrong, generally boys are taught in adolescence to be less physically affectionate and it is really sad. You probably can’t get away with too many frontal hugs, but side hugs should be fair game. I used to warn all of my friends that came over for the holidays that my family is full of huggers. I definitely don’t think that you are weird, I think more people just need a good hug"
1926,"This. There’s a lot of sad stories in this thread so heres a touch of happiness that is mine and my current girlfriends story that’s relevant to your comment!

 I’m from Australia, my current girlfriend and I are from the same country town originally and we grew up as kids together and played on the same baseball team. We both went to different schools and eventually semi-lost contact but kept on as friends(Facebook mostly) and caught up once or twice here and there but lived pretty different lives. After school we left said country town and went to separate places for uni/work. 

One day, I found an old photo of us and sent it to her randomly on Facebook as a “hey how goods this blah blah nostalgia” and then right at that moment we got to talking non stop and flirting etc. i still vow, though she disagrees, that I had no “hitting on” intentions, I just simply found the photo. Anyway, we immediately clicked like I had never before with another girl, moreso than we ever have in other conversations. I think it felt really good with the familiarity of an old friend but also the gap in contact for 10ish years so we were able to catch up and learn about each other’s lives thus far. 

Anyway, the point is that we were about 6hrs apart and when things were getting really cosy and fun, I remember her distinctly saying “what are we doing? You live there and I live here and neither of us have intentions of changing that” little did both of us know at the time, I was hating where I was living and was looking to move back to our home town, as was she.

We eventually said screw it and decided to give it a go anyway and i commuted 6 hours whenever I had days off(shift working police officer), sometimes it was just for a weekend to see her and vice versa. That went on for 4 months-ish 

As hard as it was, I was always so excited to see her that the drive was exciting and fun and I never once thought”I can’t be bothered doing this” etc

Fast forward a bit and we both now have jobs back in our hometown and are living together. After dealing with that distance and drive to now seeing each other every day, you are 100% right, it is SO WORTH IT. It was hard, absolutely, but so worth getting through the hard yards! 

I love our little story and can’t wait to retell it at our wedding one day. Have to propose first, which won’t be too far away hopefully 🤞 haha

1931,My biggest endorsement of this game is that I basically never used fast travel.  Every single other open world game I've ever played I ended up very extensively using fast travel because walking all the way across Skyrim or whatever gets tedious after a while if you're just trying to get a mission done.  In RDR just riding your horse across the countryside was damn satisfying that was how I got everywhere.  Even if it was a long trip I just enjoyed it so much that I wasn't even interested in using fast travel.
1932,Or they let him go off to catch OP.

1935,"Good idea! A whole lot more  wholesome than what I tell the elderly people who feel like it is their right to come up to me and get all up in my business. I normally tell them it was a horrific sex accident, and depending on my mood or how annoying they are I will go into very graphic detail of having a horse go to far up my butt. And I always close with saying that the horse didn't mean to hurt me, so I forgave him and our relationship is stronger than ever. "
1936,"In the US the foreman probably wouldn't face jail time especially since no one died. Its very possible for OSHA to fine a company for practices like that. It would be a large fine too. No harnesses are deadly work practices. Leading cause of deaths on a construction site are falls. The foreman would probably be fired if the company was fined by OSHA though.

1941,"Many years ago, I worked at a fast food place which lost heat in the dead of winter for about a week.  As a cashier, which meant we got the full brunt of the drafts when people went in/out the front doors.  

We had short sleeved uniforms.  Technically, we could only wear a black or white turtleneck under the uniform or a black or white cardigan over it.    


Working with food, I wanted clean turtlenecks to start out my shift.  I only had one each of black/white.  So I wore another color and so did others.    


Our dumbass manager said he could technically write us up for wearing different colors because we were supposed to wear black/white.  I pointed out we were supposed to have heat and we could technically notify OSHA and the state labor board.  He dropped it."

All of men's knowledge is stored in Boxes. The Work Box, the Sports Box, the Movie Box, the Wife Box, the Kids Box. Any knowledge about those topics are kept in their own boxes and don't mingle. All of women's knowledge is connected through wires. Makes it much easier to remember precise moments and old knowledge that can easily get lost in Men's Boxes.

Men's Secret is: Nothing. The Nothing Box. Women can't understand this very well because a wire can't be connected to nothing, but you can have a box with Nothing in it. Men really like that box."

1981,"I grew up in a small town in MI, population was less than 5,000. Down the street from my childhood home was an airstrip that was only used by crop dusters and skydivers. 

When I was maybe 8 years old I remember the whole area being full of law enforcement one day. My dad was a cop and was curious what was going on so he drove us out into the back roads, flashing his badge to get through the shut down roads. 

I remember eventually driving by this field with a crashed plane in it and the ground was torn up and it smelled kind of like burnt meat. 

At the time my dad just told me to look away, and he drove out of there real quick. He told me that one of the skydiving planes had crashed but everyone was fine.

I googled it years later, turns out everyone was not fine. It killed 10 people... That was the cause of the burnt meat smell.

1984,"For anyone confused by this, it generally* isn't a father figure thing, it's a power thing. My ex did it, I didn't mind because I'm pretty open to things as long as nothing is going inside me. I asked her about it, and she said it's about someone being authoritative and in charge, and her being submissive and getting told what to do. We tried other ones too, like 'sir', but anything other than 'daddy' made her feel too degraded. 

It isn't about fantasising about your dad, it's about having a dominant person and being submissive to them."

2006,"My dad who I never see had invited me and my big sister to the capital in order to go to an amusement park. My sister was sceptical because she thought ""Why would he do that?"". But I convinced her because I had not seen him in like 2 years. When we got there and were waiting outside the amusement park my sister got a call from him to come to the other side of the city. She said something like ""Here we go"". I started crying because I wanted to go in but eventually we got on the bus. Turned out he wanted my sister to be a witness on his and his new girlfriend wedding (who non of us have met). Afterwards they said we could do ""whatever we wanted"". They had no intentions on going to the amusement park. But my sister took me there anyways and paid from her pocket. I did not really understand why dad did not show up and fought it was sad. But I remember my sister said ""Fuck that lying cunt"" or something. Have never seen him after that, this had been going on for a long time, and only now is when I understand he do not care about us.

2018,"&gt;But the GPS will always find the location of the call after enough time.

Ah, that's nice from a gameplay perspective. In the area in which I worked, though, not exactly realistic. The way the e911 system works, there are two phases to cell phone 911 calls. Phase 1 gives cell tower information, the number the call originated from (if available - phones without an active SIM will have 911 as an area code. You are unable to call these phones back) and location data based on the cell tower's ping, usually centered around where the tower is physically located. Obtaining phase 2 information, which includes gps data calculated by the phone and triangulation between towers takes time - often more than 30 seconds from when the call is picked up - if it is able to at all. 

Even then, the location uncertainty might be within 8 to several hundred meters. Not exactly pinpoint precision when you're trying to find someone who can't communicate to you (Or find the kid who is playing with the cell phone and called 911 consecutively several DOZEN times.)

Some of my most stressful times in dispatch were trying to locate someone using only the cell data you have. Sometimes it's pretty much impossible. Other times, I can tell which aisle they are in at Walmart and walk the officer right to them. 

One fun anecdote: One of our dispatchers managed to locate a person having a stroke with some creative thinking. The caller was able to say ""help"" but then stopped talking. We sent officers to the general area, and were able to locate the address by having them chirp their siren. The dispatcher listened through the caller's phone and was able to say when the sound got closer or further away. Eventually found the guy and were able to get medics into to transport. "

2041,"Hershey's was busted for this in 2012. However, if they were to stop using child labor, the company would go under and the industry would collapse. So, instead of immedietly pulling their suppliers, they instead made a commitment that *by the year 2020* - that's right, 8 years later - they would be be child-slave free. In the mean time, that's 8 years of financing child slavery (a huge majority of it comes from the child slaves in  Ghana), and no Hershey products were pulled from grocery stores or boycotted.

It's 2018, they must be close to being child-slave free, right?

Wrong. Current analsysis of chocolate supplies show an increased dependance on child slavery today than they did in 2012, and so far there have been no repercussions to Hershey. Since they purchase their chocolate from slave owners and don't own any slaves themselves, what they are doing is legal. Not only are they financing the slave owners, the slave owners are often run by militia-type organizations (big fucking surprise there) who are involved in political wars as well as kidnapping children from other countries and smuggling them into the Ghana work camps.

http://affinitymagazine.us/2017/08/04/your-hersheys-chocolate-bar-was-made-by-child-slaves/

If that's not enough to turn you away from Hershey, maybe this is: The average chocolate bar has 8 insect parts ground up inside of it, primarilly roaches. 

https://www.nbcnews.com/healthmain/chocolate-allergies-linked-cockroach-parts-628784

So, next time you're in the store and you see a tempting Hershey's chocolate bar, just think of all the ground up roaches that are inside it and that should help you turn away from it. You can even pretend it's the child slavory that you're boycotting, and not the fact that you don't want to injest a bunch of dirty roaches. Plus the money and calories you'll save by not eating it.

2100,"I was working at a ""start-up"". I put that in quotes because this place was a ""start-up"" for over 8 years, and continued to refer to itself as a start-up until it reached break-even.  
I put my heart and soul into that place, worked nights and weekends, all for a salary that looked on the slightly high side of average for 40 hours a week, but stunk for the far more common 60+ hours.

I fought tooth and nail to get the business critical application rewritten from the ground up, as it had been written by a contractor who had retained ownership of the source code, so the company had no ability to modify code, or even properly investigate software faults - and there were plenty of those. So, I had only three requirements: 1) the company must have the source code; 2) it must be written by a developer that understood SQL (aka a different developer to v1.0); and 3) I was given enough prior notice to write a complete project specification, beyond the skeleton of ""website + HA DB + backend stuff to interface with Government API"".  
Finally, the CEO let me know that the project to write BusinessApp v2.0 had budget approval! O frabjous, glorious day! Then things got worse.  
It was being written by the same one-man developer who wrote v1.0.  
Who was once again retaining all rights to source code, and who was being retained on a very generous contract to ""provide on-going support"".  
And he was already working on it, without a proper project specification - just ""he knows what he's doing.""

That's when I knew I would have to leave Soon™. Very Soon™.

---

Finally, as I approached my eight year anniversary, the CEO announced that the company had finally reached profitable status - he was RIGHT NOW signing the checks for the first ever dividend payment to the shareholders!  
For nearly eight years, they'd stymied my requests for salary increases with ""not this year/no money/poor start-up!"" Well, surely now that the company was making a profit, they could bring me up to compensate for the years of watching inflation eat my salary from the bottom up?

I had a review meeting with the CEO and a Director. The Director gushed over how I had single-handedly pulled the company through the dark times, how the company would not have made it to the present day to break even if it had not been for my personal efforts over the last years.  
The CEO then informed me that - effective immediately - my salary was being increased by $1000. On a 40 hour work week, that's slightly less than $0.50/hr - given the hours I actually worked, it was more like $0.30/hr. Given what inflation had done to my salary, the skill set required and responsibilities involved in my role, it should have been more than ten times that.  
The CEO then offered me a one-time bonus of $1500 - if I could get the developer's new application into production within the next three months. I responded that I couldn't even get it through functional testing in the next three months, as it required a test connection to be established in a Government controlled datacentre, which would take anywhere up to two months to get installed correctly - and we couldn't even *start* that until the CEO approved the expenditure, which had been sitting on his desk for so long that I'd have to get the vendors to re-quote it.

I went back to my office and called a recruiter. Less than a month later, I handed in my notice. Within three months, I had sold my house and moved to a different city. Within twelve months in my new and far less stressful position, I earned more than 150% of my previous salary.  

Quitting turned out to be the best thing that I ever did at that company. I only wish I'd done it sooner."

Subj 2) I thought I had a warrant on me (he didn’t)

Subj 3) I was passed out in the back seat and woke up to my friends running, so I thought I should run too.

2140,"Westwood College (similar to ITT Tech, Collins College and other for-profit tech 'colleges').

My junior and senior years of high school I became depressed and just really aimless; my mom had lost her job, I didn't have any money available for college and my grades had been slipping for a while. So I didn't even think I'd go to college. During government class my senior year, our teacher had a guest speaker who was really a recruiter/salesman for Westwood. He passed out a questionnaire asking what we were interested and I noticed they had a ""video games"" section so I marked it and put down my info. Later he contacts me and set up an appointment to visit my home.

He basically lied or obscured every aspect of the school to get me to go there. He (and other administrators at the school) said the credits transferred to proper universities, when in reality they unequivocally do not. He said they were fairly priced and offered help with tuition, which in reality just mean they helped you fill out forms that gave them every cent of government student loads. He said they would soon implement video game classes and in preparation I should take their networking courses: they never had the video game courses and networking is vastly different than game design or even programming. And in the end the classes were brainless, just designed to push the students through and churn out their useless diplomas.

Some tech schools aren't terrible. My friend went to a mechanic's school and learned exactly what he needed. Tech school's are better for specific trade work. But be careful where you choose, watch the prices they charge, check their certifications. Understand tech colleges are not community colleges: they're not a cheaper option to get your basics done before transferring to a college/university proper. They're for-profit colleges that exist to milk you of as much money as possible."

2193,"Comic artist here. I used to tutor other aspiring artists so here's a story from those times. I used to hang around with a bunch of other artists and we decided to publish a comic anthology together, each would do four pages of comics and we'd share expenses and profits.

The anthology sold fairly well, but I was so exhausted afterwards that I didn't read the rest of the stories, and left my spare copies on a shelf.

Jump ahead one year. One of the other artists (call him A) stops attending the group meetings. I suppose he's got other stuff to do, so I don't pay more attention to it.

Half a year after that, another artist (call him B) from the group calls me up and tells me I have to settle my dispute with artist A. What dispute? I am surprised and curious.

He proceeds telling me how (A) has been pestering (B) for at least five months about how I keep aggravating and bullying him, that I've been talking shit behind his back, and that somehow my brother, who is a clerk at a PC store, made fun of him when he went to a local mall to buy some PC peripheral. And how he was now also pissed at (B) because they went to some random burger joint and it turned out my parents owned the joint and somehow that insulted him.

First of all, my brother at the time was 11 years old, and he certainly wasn't working.  
Second, my parents never owned any burger joint or any fast food or food joint in particular. Ever. Their professions are completely unrelated to the food industry at all.

So I concluded that (A) is crazy. (B) didn't fully comprehend how crazy until (A) started making equally ridiculous claims about (B)'s sister. (B) is a lone child.

So out of curiosity I went to read (A)'s comic in the anthology.

It was about a guy who dies, turns into a demon, horns, tail, and leathery wings, with blood covering his nether regions, comes back to Earth, and proceeds chopping up in pieces the people who tormented him when he was still a normal human. All the people he chopped up in pieces were the artists from my group.

To top it off, Demon (A) then went and had sex with all the chopped up pieces of his tormentors. In every orifice possible. Even nostrils and earholes, somehow. And THEN proceeded to drink all the spilled blood.

No real plot, no conclusion, no moral, just random acts of rape and violence.

Kept me up at night for a long time, I even considered going to the authorities over this.

Last I heard of (A) was from (B), who told me how (A) said he'd find me and beat me to a bloody pulp, after running me over with a stolen car. That was two years ago so I think I'm in the clear now. But seriously, WTF?

edit- just to get things nice and clear, because some asshole has been barraging my inbox demanding what I did to A to cause him to act this way: NOTHING. We had met a total of no more than eight two-hour sessions, and the only altercation was when once, I asked him if he had paid his share of delivery fast food, because there was some money missing from the money pit. He said yes, I went on asking the rest of the artists, and it was another dude who was drawing and didn't notice it was his turn to pay. So I said sorry to A and two other artists and all was fine.

2216,"I think it should because it was a much bigger swerve than Jurassic Bark.

All throughout the episode, you knew Fry loved Seymour, how loyal Seymour was, and at the end, you cried because Seymour was loyal till the end.

However, with Luck of the Fryish, all episode long, they were drilling it into your head that Yancy was an asshole, who did whatever he could to one-up his brother Fry. All episode until the final 2 minutes, you heard nothing but disdain from Fry about his brother. Nothing could have possibly changed him, he was always a jerk, according to Fry.

Then, literally at the very last moment of the episode, Fry learns that he isn't digging up the grave of his brother, who he believed cheated his way to the top and cheated to become the first Martian, but rather the son of Yancy, who he had specially named Phillip J. Fry, middle name and all.

In those last two minutes, we, as viewers, had to accept that our preconceived notions of Yancy were false at the same exact time Fry had to. Fry realized that his brother, who was a jerk at times, still very much cared for his brother and missed him probably more than anyone. Yancy wanted Fry's legacy to live on, something Fry never considered.

That's what makes the ending, where Fry puts the clover back into the grave while a song that has to do with rememberance all the more tear jerking.

While Jurassic Bark was an episode were sad things happen, Luck of the Fryish was the joy kind of sadness, where it was sad, bit you're happy in the end.

Their bodies or faces make subtle movements that imply ideas that the other interprets based on their own learning.

The unspoken rules of social engagement go back a long way in our genetic coding, from a time when things were drastically different. Because of this we don't realize we have a predisposed bias towards ideas, concepts and interactions. In other words we are born with genetic prejudgement that many of us are not aware of until someone points it out to us and we confront it ourselves.

This is why bugs creep us out, or why we don't like certain things, or why people seem creepy. These are all old ideas in our genetic code whose time has passed but kind of hangs around like... a former high school football star trying to relive their glory days lol.

Autistic variation gives the people born with the condition, the chance to appreciate things in a new light often if they aren't born with some of that precoded information. This is why some autistic people don't have a fear of bugs, or they feel comfortable just walking up to people to say hello, or an autist may see someone who is odd and just find them interesting instead of being creeped out.

Autists both benefit and suffer from not being born with these types of biases.

Without these biases they'll get bullied for being the only kid who thought it was ok to like bugs, rocks, or maybe for worse accidental behaviors like innapropriate bathroom usage or personal boundaries.

Really if someone is being destructive we should explain why its not ok to be destructive. But if they're doing something  we think is weird we should consider that maybe the thought patterns we are using to judge people are possibly ancient and outdated genetic code from a different time when we knew less about the world.

Its that way because really its like nobody talks about it, and if you don't identify a problem nobody fixes it."

2296,"Honestly. The state of jobs in the US. I've worked for many corporations over the years and things only seem to get worse every year. There is a GIGANTIC disconnect between most corporations and their individual stores. Policy changes, wages, what customers are really after, how customers think, how employees think and act based off situations, etc.

An example form my curent job. I work at a quick oil change place. We're a little pricier than most other places because we don't make commission, we're super fast, and we do a bunch of safety checks to make sure the work is done right. So our convential oil change is 42.99 plus tax. We'll this year corporate adjusted our premium oil change goal from 60% up to 64% which is a HUGE increase. This might not be so much of a problem, except that the same corporate office sends out tens of thousands of coupons for conventional oil changes for 19.99. They are trying to bring more customers in which translates to more money (even though we only profit $6 off a 19.99), but at the same time, they want us to grow our premium oil changes by 4%.

They don't understand that the people who bring in these coupons are looking to save money. They see more than half off an oil change from a very good trusted company, and think ""Awesome! Only $20 for an oil change in 10 minute"". They're not there to get premium oil. Most of the cars that come in with that coupon are beaters, people who may love their car, but can't afford to maintain it and thus can't afford a better oil.

When this is brought up to corporate they just double down and say things like ""Well we don't really send out *that* many coupons."" or ""It's your job to educate the customers on the benifits of synthetic oils."" True. And we do, but that's not going to magically convince a customer who came in expecting a cheap oil change to spend $40-$60 more than what they thought they were going to spend.

It's maddening. But I see crap like this *all the time*. Not just my current job. In my previous jobs as well. They can't figure out why employee retention is so low, but it never crosses their minds to improve the work environment, or maybe pay their people more than $.50 annually if they did a *really* good job.

... So this got a little longer than I wanted, but basically. Corporate culture VS actual Working Culture. "

We were playing some computer games and the kid was a little weird but nothing too crazy.

In the evening the new episode of X-Files was airing so we all sit down to watch it.

On the way back to the hotel, the father ran into a security guard. He said something like ""I know it sounds stupid, but my daughter thinks that there's a tsunami coming."" Luckily the security guard had heard about the earthquake that had happened before, put two and two together, alerted the hotel and evacuated the beach.

I sat next to a woman named Stephanie who was probably around 55-60. She told me about how her ex-husband was involved in the Russian mafia and that before she met him he had a child that was killed by the mafia when it was 3, she told me many other strange stories about her life through out the semester. 
Towards the end of the semester, I was hustling out of the building like I always did. I heard a voice yelling my name behind me and to my surprise it was Stephanie. She asked me if I was busy after class and if I wanted to go out and get drinks with her. It was 10am."

2348,"There was this kid, we will call him John. I had my first two classes with John, one being an early morning class at 6, and the next being regular high school schedule and it started at 7:30. Every day before the early morning class(probably 2-3 times a week realistically) he would drop acid and trip hardcore for the next few hours. Anyways, the second class I had with John was drawing. John was honestly a great artist, in an intro drawing class. One day we were supposed to be drawing a bear that was up on the projector, using the method where it is split up into quadrants to help you draw it proportionately. John decided he didn’t want to draw said bear, and instead drew a very realistic picture of Pope Benedict XVI. Dead ass. I have no idea where he got the idea, but he looked up a picture on his phone and started drawing. I sit right next to him and I was fucking losing it. It was manageable until the teacher came around to check if anyone needed help. He comes up to me and John and points out a few things that I can fix and he looks at Johns picture. Classes were 90 minutes and with his skill of drawing it was pretty well drawn. The teacher literally whispered under his breath “what the actual shit.” He asked John why he was drawing “this guy” and  he looked right back at the teacher and said “there is still hope for you in gods eyes” and took his shirt off and stood on his chair. The teacher took him out into the hall and I didn’t see him for a solid 2 terms at school or anywhere really. Every time I tell this story it’s hard for me to even believe and I was there for it.

2430,"&gt;I asked my son why he wrote something like that and he said he thought it was funny.

Oh that reminds me of a terrible thing that happened in Germany a few years ago. A 7 year old girl told a teacher that her father was abusing her, both sexually and physically. Of course, the teacher involved CPS and had the girl taken away from the parents. They were absolutely dumbfounded and immediately hired a lawyer. They had extremely squeaky hardwood floors that the father owuld have had to walk on at night to go and abuse his daughter, yet neither the mother nor the son ever woke up, etc. etc. They had been to the doctor with the girl very often and very regularly but the doctor never saw any suspicious bruising at all.

CPS just pretended all this evidence to the contrary didn't exist, I guess, and placed the girl into a foster family. The mother was hardly every allowed to see her and the father never, of course, so he recorded video messages for her. In foster care, she quickly started acting up, hurting other kids etc. After 3 years I think the parents were able to clear the father's name and got the daughter back, but she didn't want to come back initially and said something like ""I feel like my Mum isn't reall my Mum"" in court :( They entered family therapy and eventually they overcame all of this.

But now the kicker: Eventually the family heard about a rumor about a neighbor a few streets down. Turns out, that neighbor had been abused by her father as a kid and that father happened to be in the same career as the father in this story. Neighbor's daughter sometimes played with the daughter who claimed abuse. Neighbor starts sewing seeds that maybe daughter is being abused by her father, for months. Eventually, the girl starts to believe it.

And that's what lead to a 7 year old ""lying"" about being abused. She thought she was telling the truth, of course. I can't imagine the intense therapy that everyone must have gone through.

I'll never forget in particular when as an early teen I began asking my Dad about Christianity. I knew Dad was once a very active Christian before my birth but different problems and alcoholism had lead him to being very bitter toward Christianity. After a few weeks of him patiently and objectively discussing Christianity with me he gave me a brand new Bible with my name on it and multiple commentaries for young adults and said ""you know God and I aren't on good terms but I can see you're really interested and I think that's good. So here's some things I thought would help you learn more than I can teach you.""

Being a devout Christian now at the age of 27; I will forever consider Dad instrumental in helping me find the right path for myself by helping me find answers and allowing me to reach my own conclusions. "

2459,"1) My cousin married a woman that no one in our family liked. She got pregnant from another man while they were dating, she was verbally abusive, and she refused to work. He has a huge heart and loves the kids, thought he loved her. Anyway, at the end of the ceremony my uncle (groom’s father) stood up and demanded to know why they “skipped the part about objections.” Everyone awkwardly ignored him, and he did not show at the reception.

2) My uncle (other side of the family) gave the family two weeks notice that he was getting married. We’re scattered across the country, but managed to make it to Bumfuck, Missouri for the “wedding.” The night before, my uncle informed us that they had already gone to the courthouse and got married so it was just going to be a reception. Also, he asked that everybody bring a dish. The reception was at a public park in one of those big gazebos. It was a rainy day. We brought some stuff from a grocery store. My family members were the only people there. My uncle and his new bride stayed for maybe an hour, then departed, but not before reminding us that we had to have everything cleaned up by two. We reconciled by calling it a family reunion.

Fir example Nic Cage has to act like Travolta’s character at some points because he’s supposedly Travola with Cage’s face. At one point Cage has to pretend to be Travolta pretending to be Cage’s character which means _Nic Cage was pretending to portray Travolta’s Character’s impression of who Nic Cage’s original character would ge if they were Nic Cage_.

His boots were only on the ground for a few days when his platoon was captured by Germans. He was imprisoned in Stalag IVD for several months. He was fortunately treated very well, all things considered. I remember one of the stories he always told was about another prisoner, I don't recall his nationality, hated potatoes, and my grandpa hated carrots. So they would swap. One day, my grandpa would have cold potatoes, and the other guy would have hot carrots, the next day my grandpa would have hot potatoes and the other guy would have cold carrots. They were liberated from Leipzig, Germany later on. 

I actually have a transcribed audio recording of his stories from the war that was recorded before he passed away, in case anyone is interested in more stories! RIP grandpa, I love and miss you.

2486,"I was just saying in another comment here- I love how Parks and Rec doesn't do this. People figure out what they want very quickly (honestly sometimes too quickly) and there is really almost no relationship drama, which is nice.    
Leslie and Ben meet at work (while they are both single), start hanging out, are into each other, figure out they're into each other relatively quickly, delay getting together for a couple of episodes for Narrative Reasons (TM), get together, stay together and happy for a while, somehow break up in a way that shows that they still like each other and in the end actually improves their relationship as they realize they don't want to be without each other, stay together even when long-distance, get engaged and married (in the same season!!), stay married, have kids. It just feels wholesome and functional. Almost no real drama.    
Even when there are slightly dramatic subplots (Ann coming in the middle of the Andy/April thing, for example), they're resolved quickly and everyone becomes functional again. Ron ended up with a happy and functioning marriage almost entirely off camera. Ann and Chris break up and get back together, but it's separated by so many seasons that you barely remember they were ever together in the first place by the second go round.      
While it's a sitcom so of course there are a lot of sitcom tropes involved, I love how the drama of relationships on the show is that of real, established, loving relationships rather than volatile shitstorms for the sake of drama.      "

I was obsessed with Chrono Trigger from when I first played it. I loved how Frog spoke and would write my own stories where he was the main character, and I thought Ayla was the most badass character I had ever seen.


When it was re-released on ps1, my dad rented it for a weekend and he set up the ps1 on the tv in his room, and let me play it AS LATE AS I WANTED. I stayed up until past 2 am, and I was 13 at the time so that was a huge deal.

I thought I had some kind of ""internal fart"" and nothing else.  For the next two to three weeks, kept to my daily routine...a daily exercise walk, and then back home (am retired).  The pain wasn't too bad, so just ignored it.  But I did become less active, and did less household cleaning.  Anyway... I finally had a ""gut feeling"" that something was wrong.  Took two aspirin, laid down (about 9 in the morning), and screamed in agony when I rolled over.  Finally decided to go to the hospital.  I had another ""gut feeling"" that I would be in the hospital a long time, or possibly die.  So... I spent the next two hours cleaning my residence.  Then packed a bag and went to the hospital.  In less than an hour, had emergency surgery to remove my appendix.  Was in the hospital for the next eight days due to the massive infection.  The doc said I almost died.

It has always been helpful to have external validation about these things because it helps me to trust myself more and work towards healing. There are many people who lived next to us who probably heard or saw everything, but for a long time I was told that I was dramatic, a liar, etc. Therapy has helped immensely with this *but* if someone from my early childhood reached out I would welcome it with open arms because when you grow up being told that everything you think or feel is wrong, it can be very helpful to have as many people as possible who can confidently tell you otherwise.

2546,"Yep, clearly the series was conceived that way: a love story between two people who took most of their lives to come together, all disguised under the plot twist of an unknown ""your mother"". The problem is that over 7 seasons, these characters grew apart. Over and over it was shown how they were not great together, and how they developed stronger relationships with more suitable partners. Going back to the ending planned for them when they were first conceived was a betrayal to the characters and the audience who followed their growth.

Speaking of betrayal, Barney's was the worst. Clearly he was initially planned as the incorrigible player who can only be changed by one woman: his daughter. ""Awww haha"", right? Except that by then, it was already shown not only that he could turn the page in the name of love for a partner, but also, the series explored in depth his motivations and the fact that most of his ""bro"" thing was a mask to protect a vulnerable side of himself. The way they undid all that in 10 minutes at the end of the series only so he and Robin could fall back in their initially planned narratives is simply disgusting."
2547,"Pete Rose's record of 4,192 career hits. For a lot of reasons:

* Hitters draw so many walks in today's game. It's rare even for really good hitters to actually have enough at-bats in a season to collect 200+ hits. Rose had 200+ hits in ten different seasons. Mookie Betts is leading the majors in average and he's on pace for 180 hits.
* Hardly anyone plays for 24 seasons any more like he did. Players spend more time in the minors. And with salaries where they are, it's hard to imagine elite players whose career earnings top $100 million by age 30-32 wanting to play for another decade. 
* Rose almost never took a day off. Eight different times he played all 162 games. Managers just don't let that happen, players get days off, and teams are way more cautious with injuries. And Rose was lucky with injuries. The from age 22 through 39, the **fewest** games he played in a season was 136.

It comes to down an incredible amount of longevity and at-bats that Rose had that no players may ever reach again.

**EDIT** - 4,192 was the record Pete Rose broke, thanks for the correction. He retired with 4,256."

2586,"Having recently lost my mother five months ago, I've solicited and received a lot of advice since then.

Here's what I've learned... You never ""get over"" the loss of a loved one. Grief isn't something you work through, it's something that changes you. You'll never be the same person you were before the loss. You're you, but different. Your perspective changes. You see the world in a new and different way. The grief lives with you, but it doesn't have to control you.

Personally, whenever I feel sad (which is often), I remind myself to be thankful for the time I *did* have with her. Some people didn't get 39 years with their mom, but I did. Some people didn't get to be there for their loved one during their illness and/or passing, but I did. I'm also grateful that I had a mom who was so loving and taught me so much about the valuable things in life.

It's okay to feel sad. For the rest of your life there will be moments of sadness where you miss your parent. But there is also the rest of *your* life (whatever that may be), and the best way to honor your parents is to live a good life. That's what all parents want for their children.

Embrace your feelings and allow them to exist, but also stop and remember what they would want for you. Honor them by being the best person you can be."

Okay hear me out. Most of these things that people are saying would be the worst would be mostly useless, so you'd end up throwing them away. Throwing something away takes very little effort. 

The worst thing would be something that you can't justify throwing away, but that you don't _really_ want. But not something that actually makes you happy. So canned green beans. Canned green beans are so much shittier than fresh or frozen. They have the consistency of congealed animal fat and taste basically like nothing. But....maybe they'll come in handy sometime? And green beans are _okay_. Most people will tolerate them. So you start building this hoard of green beans, and trying to work them into your diet however you can. You try and use them for anything and everything. You start actively looking for recipes that use green beans so you can try and make a dent in this tower of green beans that you're building in the pantry. You give them away, but eventually even the local food bank says ""okay we that's enough with the green beans"". You live your life in the shadow of the thin-sliced beans. They have become a millstone around your neck. But every week they come, unceasing like the tide. Everything tastes like green beans. Everything smells like preservatives and water. Your world is beans."

When my Dad got injured at work and the owner refused to do anything about the cause of the injury, I called OSHA.  I also happened to mention that they locked the emergency exit doors to prevent people from sneaking outside for a smoke.  That got their attention quickly.

They inspected and found numerous violations in addition to what I reported.  The fine was huge, the owner fought it for a good 5 years before he finally had to pay the fine plus other penalties.  All he had to do was fix the electrical problem and not lock the emergency exits and none of that would have been necessary.

2725,"I'm surprised car sales, or car dealerships in general, isn't higher in this thread. It's usually a pretty high voted topic.

As someone who's worked at a few different dealerships over a 10 year period, I could share some stories. Some good. Mostly bad.

As with pretty much everything, not every sales person or dealership is shady or trying to steal from you. However, car sales is something that provides a relatively high commission paycheck and is considered by many sales people something that once you make the sale you're done with the customer. This attracts a certain type of sales person to work in that field because it seems like fast easy money. It's also an industry that has a lot of turn over and almost anyone can get a job as a sales person. So you can see all types of people.

But the most common type I've seen are drug addicts and people very deeply in debt. Another common one is the man or woman who recently lost their job (or their SO did) and they can't find a job in their field so they take up selling cars because it's one of the few things they can get.

Regardless of their reasoning for being in sales, many of these types of sales people don't really care about the customer. They just want to make the sale and move on. Whether it's so they can go buy more drugs, or so they can get out of that job and move on to the job they'd prefer, or just so they can get their debts paid off quickly (that's the thinking anyway).

Usually they want to sell you a used car (it has the highest profit margin for the dealership and thus the highest commission for the sales person). Sometimes they are more than willing to sell knew because they understand how kick backs work. But most often they want to push you to used so they can make more. They'll pull all kinds of tactics to sell those used cars too. I think we've all see those tactics talked about in previous threads just like this.

On the flip side of things, sometimes you can find a legitimately good sales person. I've worked with a few and bought from a few. My most recent vehicle purchase was from a saleslady who worked for her father when he owned his own dealership in town. She and her brothers took over after he passed and sold the business to another dealership. She stayed on with the new dealership because it was just about the only business she knew (she was in her late 50's when I met her). She genuinely loves her job and is a super people person. She's very likable and has a ton of customers for it. So she can forget you pretty quickly because things do move quickly. However, she did make sure to follow up and follow through with everything. She didn't just get me to sign and then neglect me afterwards. The two small issues that came up during and after the sale she made sure to get taken care of. She is a rare breed and I'll buy another vehicle from her as long as she's still there.

I worked with a great sales guy once upon a time (I was a service adviser). He went above and beyond for his customers. He came in on his off days almost every single week if a customer needed him. He was first in the door in the morning and last to leave at night. He took his customers out to breakfast, lunch, and dinner if need be. He went out of his way to make sure his customers felt like kings and queens and always followed up with every one of them. The guy was a baller. But he also never had time at home. He was kind of a work'a'holic. He made a fuckton of money but never had time to spend it.

I've worked with a variety of younger sales people too, especially women, who were very gung-ho, very nice, and very much overachievers. I've also seen some of those same people fall into the same mentality as the others who just want to sell and move on. It's easy to do. I don't blame them entirely. The nature of the business is push push push. Once you make that sale they want you trying for the next one. Not only that but since it is commission, the job itself encourages you to push for more sales. If you're spending 2 hours of your day following up with your customer you sold yesterday, then you're missing out on potential new sales.

This is why I hate sales in general. I have worked in different types of sales jobs before. They all kind of push this sell and move on mentality. Otherwise, if you want to be a good, honest, sales person, you have to devote a fuckload of time and energy to your work."

2728,"Years ago, in middle school, there was a kid who was always picked on. I came from a place where I wasn't accepted and was often picked on too, but found myself in the popular crowd. I even piled on this kid at first, trying to fit in and keeping my ""cool"" status. A few days into this I realized that I was no better than the kids who use to pick on me. So I sat with this kid and talked to him, just getting to know him. Eventually I had other kids talking to him. While he was sort of a dork and didn't fit in, kids stopped picking on him.  One day some new kid set his sights on him and the other kids in class protected him. It was a proud moment because I knew, even back in the 80s before ""bullying"" became such a hot topic, I was able to get kids to stop picking on him. "
2729,"Gets pissy as fuck when I try to even out the sheets so that I have my half and she has her half.

She yanked it and I pulled back and she started in instantly. She never wants to look and see if I'm being legit (I am); no, she just wants to have a fucking hissy fit.

When it's time to sleep I'm not in the mood for bullshit. Don't do the fucking cocoon shit and wrap yourself in the blanket, don't be using my pillows, don't pull the blanket across funny - just leave my half the bed alone. That's all I want. I don't want any of your side of the bed, I want you to be warm too - I just want the sheets to be equally divided between us. 

And she kicks in her sleep sometimes. When her leg just happens to cross over into my half the bed. How the fuck am I supposed to sleep through getting kicked?"

My reading class teacher sometimes brought in this guy from the high school, who was some sort of TA that filled in for him. 

One morning I arrive to school for morning line-up, this TA, comes to me and asks me to come with him to do morning warm-up exercises. The entire school was in the play ground for line-up; he took me to the boys restroom and asked me to lay on the floor in push-up position. He did the same on top of me and took off his pants and mine and was forcing himself inside me. I remember feeling the pain and discomfort and my vision getting blurry and maybe passing out. He did that every morning for perhaps 2 weeks. 

One day I come home and my parents tell me that the school called  and said that I haven’t been showing up to morning line-up. The weird thing to them was that my dad drove me and my 3 siblings to the same school; didn’t make sense why I was late. I didn’t know what to say. I was so embarrassed, i told them I’ve been playing with a friend. They kept asking me who, and what? I just started bawling my eyes out and told them to stop asking. They just let it go.

Have you ever read Jules Verne's *Around the World in 80 Days*? It's basically that, but steampunk and a choose your own adventure book.

You are Passerpartout, valet to Monsieur Philias Fogg, a reserved English aristocrat with far too much time on his hands. He wagers he can circumnavigate the globe in a mere eighty days and you're left to figure out the specifics.

You choose where to go, how to trade, who to speak to. There are quests to follow and hundreds of characters you can meet on your journey.

It costs $5.00, but is totally worth it. It has the writing one would expect from a book and none of the half-arsed ""slap a few gears and a pair of goggles and call it Steampunk things,"" it is wonderfully done. Frankly it perfectly embodies Verne's writing style.

Countertops, especially stovetops, were never cleaned and I they re-used every single pizza tray without washing it.

I started dating a guy who I thought was too good for me. He was handsome, ran his own business (a brothel), drove a nice Audi and had girls crawling all over him - yet he decided to have this fling with me.

The first few months of us casually seeing each other consisted of him constantly getting drunk and off his head on cocaine, sleeping with different girls and ending things with me but then getting back together with me. I don’t know why I put up with that to begin with, low self esteem I guess?

Flash forward to when he loses his brothel. How you may ask? He held a barbers razor to one of the girls throats and threatened to kill her. He had spent all his money on drugs and rent etc. I stupidly gave him $2000 of my own money I had saved up. All of it was gone in a few weeks after he spent it all on drugs and alcohol.

A few months past and he has no money, no motivation, constantly cheating on me, still a drug and alcohol addict. He gets a deal with a new brothel. They say if he can bring in Caucasian girls into the Asian brothel, he will get $15 for every job his girls do. None of the girls he had were attractive so he asks me to work for one week just to prove he can bring in attractive Australian girls. I work and he sees how much I can pull in. He asks if I want to work more - I wasn’t open to the idea of doing it at all as I thought I loved him so much and wanted to be faithful to just him. He said that he still loves me and that it won’t change anything but if I do decide, I need to give him 30% of what I earn as it’s what all working girls do if they have a boyfriend. Stupid me fucking agrees.

Months go by of me working in this shop. 12 hour days. Not seeing the daylight or most of the night. Him threatening me if that if I leave early, he will tell my parents what I’m doing. I’m giving him 30% of my earning plus giving him money if he needed it. He was getting me to have sex with his friends to pay for cocaine. He ends up dealing cocaine and I still don’t see a cent of any money he owes me. Constantly cheating on me and lying to me. Throwing his xbox at me or hitting me with his keys, he once threw a door at me. 

Eventually, I’m done. I overdosed on antidepressants after he left me voice mails and text messages saying how worthless I am and how no one is going to love a slut like me and how he is going to ruin my family by telling them. When I get released from hospital, I come home to my phone and open up to see death threat after death threat. I end things with him completely and cut ties. 

He got charged with domestic violence for king hitting his ex girlfriend before me and leaving her unconscious in her own blood in an elevator. He got off those charges because she is just as crazy as him and wrote letters saying how she’s sorry and never wanted him to get in trouble. Recently found out he is in jail for armed robbery.

Me? I’m a successful private escort with a loving boyfriend who is supportive of me and what I do. We are in an open relationship but we tell each other everything and ask for permission beforehand. We have the best life and I am more happy than ever."

Hell at my court appearance there were about a dozen of us at once -the judge read out the standard disposition for DUIs and just asked if anyone wanted to push back/argue not guilty/ask for something else. A couple special cases later (one disabled person, one claiming financial hardship), the bailiff passed around our paperwork and we all registered to pay our fines and show up for community service hours.

This especially bothered me because I had just read an Ann Rule book which had pictures of drawings by the killer.  The child's drawings were very similar to those in the book.

Here's a funny one that I told a while back.  A friend who taught in early elementary had a little boy come in one morning and say something like, ""Look at this cute little whistle.  I found it in the trash at home.""  He then proceeded to put it into his mouth and whistle.

My friend recognized the item as a disposable applicator for a feminine anti-yeast infection product.

Edit: I think people are misunderstanding the point I'm trying to make.

The recession didn’t last forever and eventually we’d have been back to surpluses.

Luckily, my dog won’t eat anything unless I or my parents give it to him, but I had to watch him closely the entire week we were there, and the little shit kept making jokes about trying to do it again.

The worse beating happened when I was 16. She was pregnant again by a different criminal at the time, but that didn't stop her from kicking my bedroom door in half, ripping the phone out off the wall, and choking me all while telling me what a stuck up bitch I was. I managed to run barefoot to a convenience store and call the police who did nothing. She went for a drive, and left her oldest with me again. 

I told her that day I was DONE with her. She mocked me, but I meant it. Here we are 13 years later and she knows not to approach me when I visit home. Our mom says she thinks I look down her (I do), and told her the reason why, but this bitch claims she doesn't remember the abuse.

Dance was ok, i didn’t know many people there but they had good food and i was slightly tipsy. But then, suddenly, i knew something was wrong. 

I rushed to the bathroom and threw up. I spent most of that night in the bathroom with a bad case of food poisoning. It was fairly embarrassing as well, because i knew almost no one and they all probably thought I was some random chick who got way to wasted at their dance

My friend talked to some people there and they said that they weren’t able to get me back. She asked if a friend could pick us up and (i have no idea why) but they said nope. I had to wait to go back on the buses until the dance was over. So i spent the entire night in a bathroom stall with food poisoning a sorority dance. Not fun

Had a plate in his skull and a bunch of pictures of him and his unit along the way to Germany. He brought back souvenirs from his tour, including his helmet. My mom got them, but doesn't know what she did with them.

He hated the idea of killing other people, but believed 100% in the cause of stopping Germany. He didn't like talking about what he did because of how glorified it was.

3106,"I remember during the gamecube/ps2/xbox era having a conversation with some people about the gamecube's considerably lower sales than the other two, and debating if Nintendo was going to have to go the sega route and just make games with their properties on others' consoles. Someone pointed that while Nintendo's home console sales were struggling at the time, their handheld consoles had been dominating that segment of the industry since the original gameboy. Especially with the release of a little thing called Pokemon. 

When analysts said the DS was a bad idea, because they would essentially be competing against themselves and the fairly recent gameboy advanced, the DS went onto become hugely successful alongside the also hugely successful gba. I'm not sure where they stand today in handhelds, but it always seemed like people who had a sega gamegear or vita were few and far between, while finding someone with a GBA or 3DS was pretty common.

3117,"City council hired another medic. Older dude with long hair, not that that matters. He was new to the scene recently completing the course.

Guy why awesome to hang out with. Went to the bar with the younger emts, played video games, etc.

At first I thought he was cool but as I observed his work (I was his superior and did his probationary eval) I noticed something was off.

At the private council meeting I spoke openly about this in his 30 day review. I stated something was off. He didn't seem like a people person and generally the type that would do this job.

They said that I had no grounds to state that he wasn't suited and that he did his job as described.

I countered with the fact that when caring for people being a people person is an unwritten rule and that doing your job without caring leads to mistakes, and in our job field a mistake means death.

They weren't having it so I finally said ""look in this job field you need to learn to read people and in telling you that something isn't right here""

City council told me that basically I was jealous because he got along with the emts. Honestly I could careless, I'm not in this job for them.

Fast forward a month and I get a call from an er about an hour from us. They said that their report said the patient was administered 80mg of drug x. The patient denied receiving it and since they couldn't figure out wtf the medic would have even given it they ran a tox panel on him which showed that he did not receive it.

The doc told me normally he'd let it slide as an error and ask me to speak to him about accuracy, but he felt something was off.

I thanked him and after hanging up pulled the trip sheets. Right in the run report it has the drug, the amount given, and the time.

I pulled up the narcotics log. It showed drug given and replenished along with the tag numbers.

Next I called a friend of mine who is a local cop and was off duty at the time. He came over and I opened the other medics narc box. Sure enough it had been opened and replaced.

We then went through his logs for the past 2 months he had been working and located at least 12 times drugs had been given when probably not needed.

I called the er doc back and explained to him and his exact quote ""here's my personal phone number and our lawyers number. I'll fax you over a written statement along with the test results. I'll see if we have anything on other patients he brought in""

My buddy then called dispatch to tell the council members there was an emergency at the station and they need to come in.

When they got there we showed them all the evidence and what we suspected. Within 15 minutes we not only had the da approval but also a judge sign an arrest warrant.

Turns out the dude admitted to having a 20 year pain killer addiction that he ran out of sources so he figured being a medic would give him easy access. He even told the judge he was worried that he would have killed someone just for the meds.

At the trial I was asked for what resolution I wanted. I told the judge being a paramedic I've seen how drugs change a person and that I don't hold him fully responsible. On my recommendation he got 3 months in a locked drug rehab facility followed by 6 months of house arrest.

4 years later the dude is clean and runs a fund raiser to help raise money for the end to provide anonymous narcan services and drug awareness programs.

Today this guy would be an honored member of my crew. Addiction literally changes people.

The end result is I now am solely responsible for hiring the medics, reviewing, and dismissal. I no longer need to justify to council why someone was dismissed. This job is one where a gut feeling decides someone's fate."

3119,"Living.

When you first move out, or become even slightly financially independent, you realize how everything today is meant to skim by, by skimming out of your wallet. Last year, about this time, I got towed in Charleston, they tried everything to keep my car so they can charge $4-500 the next day. I needed to drive to school, and only stopped to see some friends. I was frantically calling my parents, etc. Then you realize it's on you. I ended up getting a copy of the title, notarized to the towing place, fifteen minutes before they closed. Ended up costing me, pretty much all my move in money. Then you get rejected for a student loan, so now your payment plan for the school is overdue. No big deal I thought, they charge $200 for a late payment, and I'll make some calls to my relatives. I end up with nothing, short for I think it was 2 grand to finish the semester. They then kick me off the payment plan. I pay all their late fees and shit, and I see they put a hold on my transcript. I called them up, and I asked what it was. It was a fee for the rest of my schooling, and I was banned from the payment plan. I was like I paid all your late fees, I paid everything in full, and the next semester I paid in full. Why am I being charged more, after already paying some $400-500 for all the late fees. Then you realize, the whole system is rigged to keep you poor. I have student loans at 13 percent, I have a 750 credit score, and nearly 10k in income, while a full time student.

TLDR: The system is shit, the trick to living, is to never become poor. Once you're poor, they'll do everything to keep you poor.

Edit2: Please enough with personal attacks. Yes, I know 10k/year is not really income, it's just I'm 19, I work as hard as I can, and I go to school full time. It's fine to give me a rebuttal, and explain why you disagree with me, just please refrain from the personal attacks because I'm at work, and I don't like being agitated at work. If you want to judge me about a simple mistake I made, or the fact that 10 months ago I didn't have credit(neither do my parents they recently declared chapter 11), and had to take a 13% percent loan, fine, if not fine. Just leave me be with the calling me a moron, because I didn't feel like I had a choice. It was either accept the loan, or be a college dropout, neither of which I was ecstatic about. But if you want an update, that 4k loan is now a 3k loan, and I've been paying slightly more than interest since I got it, and I am going to wait till after college to start paying back my federal loans(6%), with obvious reasons."

3136,"Dim Sum at a local Chinese restaurant that constantly gets lauded as being super authentic. The seafood tanks had obviously dead fish floating in them. Where we sat we could see the server station and we got to watch multiple members of wait staff use their bare hands to scrape food from plates/bowls into the trash, push down the trash and then go back to handling food and plates. Horrendous.

Figured I was being too precious and tried to just roll with it. First dumpling I bit into had a hair in it. I managed to grab the hair and swallow the bit of dumpling already in my mouth. Didn’t want to just spit it out in front of the whole dining room. Or seem “high maintenance” in front of my dining companion. The hair is still connected to the uneaten portion of the dumpling and begin trying to pull it out. This hair is weaved into every nook and cranny of this dumpling like some kind of nightmare meat embroidery. I keep pulling and pulling while the dumpling falls apart around the loose strand of hair. This thing is easily thee feet long and I can’t imagine how a person would not notice it being worked into a hand-rolled dumpling. This whole ordeal is somehow not noticed by my boyfriend who remarked when I pushed the plate away, “you’re just going to waste that?”

I legitimately felt sick so I went into the bathroom. We arrived as some of the first guests of the day, appx 20 minutes after opening. The trash was overflowing with paper towels and there was toilet tissue covered in human feces scattered around the floor. There was no soap in the soap dispensers and it smelled like how my mouth tastes when I wake up after a night of binge drinking and hot wing eating.

Despite all of this I still felt like I had to be polite and not say anything. I ate a few more small plates of food and rode home in near silence with my boyfriend. As we were pulling into the driveway he just said, “that was fucking fowl.” We both went inside, brushed our teeth, and never spoke of it again.

3137,"The answer to the question really depends on your definition of “unhealthy”. 

I think today most of us equate unhealthy primarily with weight gain.

However we often forget about other aspects of unhealthy like cholesterol, mercury, carcinogens, excess sodium etc.

The fact is you pretty much can make a blanket statement on any food, because nearly every food is unhealthy in excess. Including water.

Most people would consider Sushi and canned tuna to be healthy...which it is generally. But eat it too often and it can cause excess mercury buildup your liver can’t handle. Or start loading it with soy sauce and you’re going to overload on sodium messing up your kidneys and blood pressure. Or get fat from all the carbs in the rice.

Most people consider fruit and berries to be healthy. Eat too much and you’re overloading with sugars (albeit natural sugars). You can get super fat eating fruit.

Most people consider ordering Salads to be healthy. But a lot of stuff people put on salads is loaded with carbs. And the dressings everyone puts on it are usually loaded with salt and sugar. 

Pretty much any food served in nice restaurants is loaded with salt , butter, and/or sugar.  

Eat too much avacado, get excess saturated fat.

Drink too much water even and you can die of hyponatremia.

Health is about balance. Keeping your body balanced and macros balanced.

Also avoiding things with a lot of ingredients where there should just be 1 or 2 is a good place to start."

3186,"Remember back in the day when handheld releases were wildly different compared to their console counterparts? Nobody ever talks about Gameboy Advance ports, but they're the most fascinating shit to me.

LEGO Star Wars, the wildly-successful platformer for console, got turned into a shitty isometric game on GBA. Rayman 2, that game that got too many ports, ALSO got a port on the Gameboy Color, and it's _terrible._ Remember Rayman: Raving Rabids, that Wii/PS2 game everyone pretends to hate but also have a soft spot for? Yeah, you missed out. The GBA version was a proper platformer in the style of Rayman 1. 

Hell, Mario Kart got a GBA game and it was so clunky that they had to sell it on including all the SNES tracks. Banjo-Kazooie actually got a proper platformer on GBA, and it's widely-considered by fans to be (though somewhat short and not super great), the closest we'll get to a proper Banjo-Threeie. It's alright, nothing I'd ride home about, but it's worth a play if you desperately want more Banjo stuff.

3197,"My brother and I were living in Chicago. We had to get to Panama City Beach for my cousin's wedding the next day. Naturally, we flew. 

Our first flight was to Atlanta. Seemed to go pretty well. We were only slightly delayed in taxiing (Atlanta's airport is pretty big), but with some light jogging, my brother and I made our way to the gate. We were there with 5 minutes to spare. Unfortunately, the plane had already left -- I guess they were &lt;90% occupied and had a green light from ATC, so leaving my brother, six others, and me off the plane was totally okay. The airline wouldn't comp us apart from a hotel room at the airport for a night, which we politely refused. We had to make this 5 hour drive that night to get there in time for all of the ceremonies. No way were we posting up, checking out early, and trying to make it.

Do me a favor and look up the fastest route from Atlanta to Panama City. That's \[basically, thanks stupid ass Hertz Garmin\] what we took.

My brother and I decided to split the drive into two shifts, since it was already about 11pm once we got our rental car, and we were both exhausted. He took the first shift and I nodded off to sleep. Somewhere between Atlanta and Columbus, a deer came out of nowhere and struck our car. It slammed the entire driver's side panel. My brother was, needless to say, scared shitless. He immediately asked me to take over, which I obliged (because what in the fuck a deer hit us). I then proceeded to go through Columbus and enter Scooby Doo county, apparently.

We had to stop for gas. I should have fucking stopped in Columbus. Instead I picked a shady town, half destroyed, covered in thick fog. I passed a defunct diner, a bail bonds place, and some other indistinguishable small businesses before finding the gas station with steel bars across the windows. My brother was still asleep as I got out of the car.

I get out and start filling. I needed to pee, but fuck going in that place. Could barely see across the street I just came in on. I do a double take and there's a man with a beat up cowboy hat and coveralls just sort of ... standing there under the light of the convenience store.

""Whatcher doin out so late at niiiight?"" he said. Seemed nice enough.

""We just hit a deer. We're driving to Panama City for a wedding."" I replied.

""No sheeeit? Did it leave a big ol' dent?"" he mosies over toward the car and starts inspecting. Makes a couple whistling noises and shit. My brother stirs awake and sees the man. He's startled but luckily doesn't start screaming or anything. The man comes a little closer to me once he hears the ""click"" on the pump.

""Welp ... guess ya ... better be on your way"" he said in a lower voice as he stepped toward me.

3199,"Well in this situation I’m the one who revealed the horrifying thing. My cousin sexually assaulted me throughout my childhood and most of my teen years (I was 17 when I finally couldn’t take it anymore and told someone.) I think my mom and dad had an inkling that something was weird about him. They immediately went no contact and fully supported me in pressing charges. My brother had always looked up to him, so he had a phase of being very angry - anger that was sometimes directed at me since I was the one who was there, basically. But he came around eventually (really it would have been difficult for him not to since he still lived with my parents and me.)

My grandparents, aunts, and uncles all called me a liar. Then when my cousin pleaded guilty they were still furious I pressed charges. Apparently “family doesn’t do that to each other” (right, family can rape each other but pressing charges is not allowed. Solid logic right there.) I had always kind of been the black sheep among my dad’s family members, so they basically did whatever mental gymnastics were necessary to have me be the bad guy. They even came and sat with my cousin in court when he plead guilty and had to describe what he did to me. They all still have a big family relationship and tell anyone who will listen about how I’m a stupid whore and my dad and brother are traitors. 

In the middle are my dad’s aunt and uncle. They are the only ones who still have a relationship with our family, but have the annoying habit of telling my dad how nice it would be if we could all just make up and get along. Oh, and my cousin got a slap on the wrist, so that sucked. It’s off his record now because he did some counseling and community service.

While I’m still kind of bitter about the extended family’s reaction, I know I’m lucky to have the support of my immediate family - many girls who are victimized by relatives don’t get even that."

3270,"When I was told I wasn’t human enough. 

I was in a telemarketing sales role for a startup in the wine trade. I had recently left a 10 year long sales and business development career to pursue full time study, and was looking for a stress free job that gave me work life balance. I stumbled across a well paying, fun loving start up that sold wine. I knew sales and I liked wine so I got a job selling wine over the phone. 

Now I’m no wine expert. I’m not the best sales person to walk the Earth. But I was hitting all their measurable targets. 

But something felt off. I felt singled out. I was constantly pulled aside to review recordings of my calls with supervisors that had never received formal training in teaching and developing staff. And after being awarded a certificate for completing my 3 month induction training successfully, I was shortly after issued a performance improvement plan (not a performance management plan, I was assured).  

The first action I was to be measured on was my personality and I quote “needs to be more human”. I was stunned. And confused and upset and angry. Myself, who I am, was not good enough.  I was too polite, too sweet. Not as cool, or quirky, or unique, or loud and out there as they wanted me to be. 

I’m totally turned off the idea of working for a start up after this experience. The ping pong tables, free wine, monthly drinks, birthday and Christmas parties were such a ruse. The constant rewards were there to imitate amazing culture, rather than really investing into the team to teach and develop them, and really listen to what they need. 

Not everything is as it seems. "

That feeling is kind of awesome. It's also fucked. I think most guys have experienced both sides of it.

I live in an area that has more pigs than people. The average population density of the county I live in is 67 people per square mile.   Most of this is around the townships. I work in agriculture and have been in areas where houses were a mile apart from each other.   I can promise you that 90% of the houses in the county own a firearm. That firearm is a tool. It’s not just for one thing. It’s their deer rifle. Their varmint gun. Their home defense from predators both two and four legged. It protects their crops from feral pigs and deer, their cows and chickens from coyotes and foxes and their homes from people wanting to do them harm. A phone call to the Sheriff department can take between 15-30 minutes. In that time you have yourself and your rifle to rely on.   

So for those in the city. I understand that you only see firearms as a way for people to kill other but where I live it is a lifeline. A necessity.   Western Europeans don’t quite understand the vastness of the US. They hear reports out of New York and Los Angeles but hear nothing about the Midwest or rural south. The emptiness and distance in the areas where most of the food people eat comes from is mind boggling to someone from the city. When groceries are a 15 mile drive and a movie theater is another 10-20 after that you learn to be more self reliant. There isn’t just pop into the store and pick stuff up. In these areas we have to be self reliant. So yes. We own guns. It’s a necessity. "

Late '70s, and I'm a sophomore at Caltech and decide to try hallucinogenic mushrooms. I want to do it at a time when there won't be a lot of people around, so pick a Saturday evening when there was a campus wide organized trip to Disneyland that would have a large fraction of the students away.

I take the 'shrooms, wait until I'm well under their influence, and then head down to where there were some pinball machines to play some pinball.

Then I hear someone speaking Chinese and a couple Chinese people that I don't recognize walk by. Then a couple more Chinese speaking Chinese people that I don't recognize walk by. Then more. Heading outside, I found the campus was full of Chinese people that I did not recognize, walking around in groups of two or three and speaking Chinese to each other. (Remember, this was late '70s. Only maybe 2 or 3% of Caltech students were Asian then. Now it is around 40%, which actually makes them the largest racial group there, edging out white by a couple of points--but Caltech is small enough that students should recognize by sight all other students, so even today this would have been unusual because while them all being Asian would not be odd, them all being strangers would still be).

This was starting to freak me out, because I had done a lot of research beforehand on what to expect under 'shrooms, both during a normal trip and a bad trip, and *nothing* had said anything about hallucinating the world turned Chinese.

Eventually I found out what was going on. I was not the only one taking advantage of most Caltech students being away at Disneyland. The Chinese Students Association had picked that night to throw a party and invite all the Chinese students from UCLA, USC, and pretty much every other university in Southern California."

3412,"Rather than just chiming in and saying ""I'm here!"" let me tell you a brief story.

------

My absolute favorite toy when I was a kid was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figure. It was Leonardo, specifically, and it had this neat ability that would let me wind it up and make its right arm spin around in a motion guaranteed to fight off any aggressors. I spent hours upon hours with that hunk of green plastic, and it was often the one item I'd bring along to keep myself entertained at ""grown-up events.""

For instance, I took my toy to a wake once – back when I was about five years old – and had a rousing adventure of ""Leonard Versus 'The Olds.'"" These were villains that I invented on the fly, and they were each represented by the toy's sword, which I had re-purposed into a makeshift cane. ""The Olds"" themselves were invisible, so the cane was the only way that Leonard could detect them... other than the fact that they'd scream ""*I am an Old!*"" whenever they got too close to him. He had to heavily rely on his arm-spinning ability in order to fight them off, all the while shouting about how he'd end their lives.

My father told me to stop playing that game pretty soon after that.

Anyway, after an ill-advised excursion to the sandbox, Leonardo's whirling arm stopped functioning quite as well as it once had. When I complained about this to my parents, they both agreed that the toy's inner workings had probably been saturated with sand, and that its motions were likely to be permanently hindered as a result. This news – that my favorite toy was in slightly less than pristine condition – made me feel angry, confused, betrayed, and a whole host of other things that my five-year-old brain didn't yet have a way of putting into words.

My response to these emotions, for whatever reason, was to storm over to the trash compactor, throw my action figure into it, and then press the button to smash it.

Put yourself in my position for a moment. You've just hurled your favorite toy into the garbage, and you've started the process to utterly destroy it. You immediately regret this decision. Time is ticking down towards the Shredder's imminent victory. Your only course action – just like mine – would be to burst out into tears, claw at the trash compactor, and scream for someone to save Leonardo.

Thankfully, my father had seen me in the midst of making a bad decision, and he had quietly moved to stand behind me, just in case I changed my mind. As soon as I started trying to extricate my toy from the predicament into which I'd put it, he reached forward, ended the compaction process, and retrieved my action figure from the mess of coffee grounds into which it had fallen.

""You *almost* lost this, Max,"" he told me, holding the toy in front of me. ""Are you going to take better care of it now?""

""Y-y-y-yes..."" I sobbed in reply.

""Do you *promise* you'll *never* do anything like that again unless you're *absolutely sure* it's what you want to do?""

I nodded. ""I p-p-promise.""

With a satisfied (but still skeptical) look on his face, my father returned Leonardo to me, then sent me off to play. The toy's arm was still stiffer than I was used to, of course... but by then, I'd decided that I could live with it.

**TL;DR: I nearly destroyed my favorite toy, but my father stepped in and averted my ploy.**"

Now, my dad was the guy who was stone walling the whole situation. Laughing about the funny things that happened, looking at the positives, hugging the people that were upset, assuring everyone everything was fine.

I could tell it was taking a toll on him, and I didn’t want to add to that, so I was right there with him. Telling people we were all ok, laughing at the silly hospital occurences, just trying to be a Pillar, helping to hold everyone up.

Then one day, I was at a movie with my aunt. We were watching Hunger Games. Things were going fine, until she got a phone call from my dad. The Nurses were saying things didn’t look good, so my dad called everyone to the hospital.

Her kidneys had failed, so she was basically comatose, with tubes and wires running from her to various machines. When she saw me though, she completely perked right up, not wanting me to worry about her.

I could feel myself starting to break down, so I went to leave, cause I didn’t want anyone to see me cry. As I got to the door though, my dad called me back in for whatever reason. So I took a deep breath, and literally sucked the tears back into my eyes, and went back in with a smile on my face.

After stopping myself from crying that day, I just don’t cry anymore. I just don’t think I can justify crying about anything, if I can’t even cry about my mom passing away."

It's only been within the last few years that it's not significantly gotten worse and has kind of leveled off. I think my mother's eyesight improved slightly ONCE in the 50 fucking years she's worn glasses.

Poor girl is terribly lost in all this because no one in her family wears glasses. I told her to just expect his eyesight to rapidly degenerate as he grows and then level off in adulthood. At least until you start getting Old People Eye Problems.

3470,"Loss of topsoil epidemic. 

We have less than 60 years of topsoil remaining. Current industrial farming is the main cause of loss of topsoil, planting thousands and thousands of single-crop (monocrop) fields with uncovered bare soil. When it rains, the topsoil gets carried off to the lakes and rivers. We need to topsoil to survive. 

If this is news to anyone, I suggest doing some research on the topic and getting involved. Help grow some of your own food in order to reduce the burden on industrial chemical Ag. Buy non GMO products (I'm actually pro GMO technology, just not how we humans are using it to nuke the herbaceous layer and create monocrop grown on bare soil). 

We simply can't keep going this way or we are toast. Many believe this is the single biggest existential threat to the human race. This topic is really THE answer to this thread. Bees are super important of course, but many crops are beetle and fly or self (wind) pollinated. ALL crops need soil to grow in.

3471,"Is this common place amongst officers? That if you do something catastrophically stupid during a traffic stop you'll say fuck it and let the driver go?

No lie. The first time I ever tried LSD I was with my best friend. And right about the time we started peaking, we were riding in the backseat of a friends car. He's the impatient type and winds up passing a car in the middle lane of a three lane road. 

Motorcycle cop sees this and hits the lights. We're freaking the fuck out in the backseat, hallucinating wildly and coherent enough to know that we getting pulled over on some serious shit. 

So the officer dismounts, and we're watching through the back window. He walks about halfway to us when all of a sudden, *BAM*, the motorcycle crashes over on it's side. Just eats shit on the side of the road, loud enough for anyone on the street to hear it. So he turns back to get it and a random guy in front of the church we're pulled over in front of runs out to help him. 

Now me and my friend are losing it watching this. Full on, uncontrollable laughter, not knowing whether we ACTUALLY saw this, or if we're REALLY fucked up.

3510,"Every year or two I take a roadtrip from the Midwest down to the Southwest (usually alone). Always passing through Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, etc. I was cruising through NM, on the loneliest stretch of highway, hadn't seen a car in at least an hour, when I realized I had just about a quarter of a tank left. I went on for about, hm, maybe 20-30 miles when I finally see a gas station. I pull up pump my gas and decide to head in for snacks and a bathroom break.

Now let me describe this place. It's in the middle of nowhere, nothing for miles.. just sand and rocks and cactus. It was a pretty run down looking gas station, but that's not too much cause for concern considering a lot of the places in the middle of nowhere look like this. It was shanty and made of wood, not like an old western style wood, more like a serial killer in the middle of the woods kind of wood, you know that damp, could break apart if you kicked it kind. Anyway, so I walk in and there is a convenience-store side and a (I guess you can call it) diner side. The first thing I notice is that EVERYONE turned to look at me and definitely knew I was NOT from around here. There were 4, unbearably grimy men (wife-beater tanks with stains, pants that are dirty, they are tan from the NM sun, just dirty, fat, greasy middle aged men) sitting at one of the four diner tables just staring me down. Shit you not, there was a spit bucket for there tobacco too (it was disgusting). The only other person I saw was the clerk, so I ask where the restroom is, this 6ft tall, definitely does meth looking woman doesn't say a word and just points to the hallway. I say thank you and start walking. As soon as my back in to these people, I can feel eyes. I get to this hallway which is about 10-15 ft long, one overhead light is working fine, one is flickering, and on each wall is 2 giant corkboards. FILLED with ""Missing Person"" flyers. These things went back from the 1980's to the present (it was 2015 at the time), and were mostly women and children.

I stopped dead in my tracks maybe 5 feet into this hallway when chills rushed over me and I just stared at all the posters (maybe a solid minute) ... there were literally hundreds... and then I turned around slowly and walked back toward the exit as calmly as I could. I could feel the eyes of all the unsmiling people as I nervously paced toward the door, while telling the clerk I forgot my wallet in my car (like I needed to explain something?). My hands hit the door and I glance back to see only 3 men sitting at the table now. My heart dropped and total panic kicked in, the second my foot was out the door I ran as fast as I could to the car, got in, and sped off. 

It was hands down the creepiest, most unnerving gas station or place I have ever been."

A few years ago, we were feeding a stray feral cat (she was so wild you couldn't get *near* her - now she's safely indoors!).  I guess she thought she should ""thank"" us, because over the course of a week she brought us one mouse, one bird, and two chipmunks.

~~Because I am probably batshit,~~ I sat down on the porch and told her that it was OK, she didn't have to try to feed us.  But on the inside, I was just so *touched* that she was trying to give back to us.  All of the poor creatures were left on our doorstep *intact*, whereas the she left in our neighbor's yard had been mostly consumed.  So she wanted *us* to have them.  I just thought that was so sweet.

Edit to add an actual kid story: One of my good friends told me this one.  When her kid was about three, he walked up to his dad brandishing the TV remote and demanded, ""Put the cartoons on, dumbass!"".  She said she had to leave the room so her kid wouldn't see her laughing! 😹"

And their response? ""Why is everyone leaving, we just can't understand it.""

I thought about it, and ultimately responded that I wasn’t sure. Can’t say that helped the process, tbh. "

I had been diagnosed with dystymia, pretty much had depression since I was in Jr high that never went away. 22 now and diagnosed with adult ADHD-I. Turns out I wasn't a lazy piece of shit, I just had undiagnosed ADHD that I never noticed because I'd always been that way.

You know what can be a co-occuring symptom of ADHD? Depression. Went off the antidepressants and on to Adderall and it's been like night and day. I think ADHD also plays on your dopamine levels, which could explain the depression.

3656,"About 10 years ago, I was on a family road trip to Mount Rushmore. We were driving across the eastern part of the state at night through an area that was all forest hills on either side of the interstate, and as far as I can recall, no cities remotely nearby. We'd been driving for at least a few hours (coming from Wisconsin) and it's absolutely pitch black out there. Well, we're coming up on a stretch where the forest is set back from the highway a bit and you can see hills off about a half mile away.


There, in the middle of absolute nowhere, is this carnival/fair set up in the woods. It was on a gentle hillside sloping towards the highway, so you could see everything laid out. Tents, a ferris wheel, miscellaneous other rides and stalls, things like that. Not massive, but I'd say it was your typical local fair. Except...in the middle of the night, in the middle of the South Dakota forest, nowhere near anything. It had a faint greenish neon glow to it and the typical fair design made it seem like it was straight out of the 1950s. I can distinctly remember the ferris wheel turning.


Not too strange right? I swear on my life, there was not a single person walking around, and not a single car or even a road in sight. Granted, it's possible the access road and parking were in the woods on the opposite side, but I couldn't make out how on Earth you'd get there, as I don't think there was even an exit off the highway in that stretch of road. My mom was also awake for this, but just us two. We have tried and failed miserably to find a single bit of info about any sort of carnival or fair in this region.


If anyone wants to try researching, I believe this trip was around May or June, and probably 2008ish, and we were coming up on Custer, SD (I'd guess 1-3 hours away to the east). At the time, it was just like a ""huh"" moment, but later on we realized just how eerie the whole experience had been."

3658,"Old boss brought in probably a dozen big Poinsettia plants around the holidays. Maybe more. They were everywhere. Arranged them all around the entrance to the office. He did this all without saying a word to us. We kinda look at one another and shrug. The dude likes Poinsettias. Fine.

About a week later, they were all in pretty bad shape. 

He walks in toward the bullpen area of the office in a huff and exclaims ""Guys! These plants are all dying! How come nobody's been watering these?"""
3659,"The boss had a pattern:

1. Enter a new market
2. Find a young person business partner, YPBP, talented but woefully undercapitalized, who has a client and a project in hand
3. Offer to underwrite their expansion, create a new business with them
4. But since young person had no capital, offer them a 50/50 partnership, but with the Boss putting in capital, the YPBP in sweat equity
5. Play up his strong Christian faith, and successful track record, and explain that ""you asking him to sign paperwork was akin to calling him a liar. and if you believe in God, then you're calling God himself a liar, because this business was ordained by God""
6. Get in market, make all of the money, and right before the client cuts the massive check, fire the young person business partner
7. YPBP says: ""hey, wait, I thought we were partners"", the Boss said: ""nope, you're just an employee, nothing in writing""
8. The boss then calls up the client, and explains that YPBP was a liability, and lying to them the whole time, and he had to fire them to protect the client

I saw the dude do this **three times** in the first **six months** I was there. Around month 9, he gets three separate lawsuits, from each of the YPBPs he'd screwed over, AND gets a summons for defrauding a municipal government.

Because all of these things are happening at the same time, he gets hyper-paranoid, and assumed that **there is a mole in the operation - -- feeding intel to all of the enemies of Christ**, and he's going to find out who the mole is. 

He proceded to pull me into his office, dozens of times, spend hours weeping about what a decent and good man he was, and how the enemies of Christ were conspiring against him, and how he knew I was in league with them, but couldn't prove it.

it was a bad time, he tapped my office phone line and read all of my emails. I ended up losing 20 lbs due to the stress.

Eventually, he moved to Puerto Rico."

No. No it's not.

Anytime my SO and I would make plans we'd invite others, but then they'd try to change them ""Oh little Johnny won't be happy there, we should go to &lt;insert family-friendly&gt; restaurant instead!"". Oh no, we couldn't bring Little Daniel to a rock concert at her age!

Who said the kid was invited? Get a sitter.  We're going regardless of whether or not you are, we just wanted to invite you to come with us. If you can't, sorry, but we're not changing our plans because of your child.

The final straw came when we were having our annual summer BBQ. This is an event that involves fireworks, alcohol, smoking, loud music, firearms, and adult context. One of our friends told us how excited she was for it, then handed us a list of ""baby proofing"" we would need to do for her child. Including no firearms, no alcohol except in the garage, and no smoking.

My SO tried to be polite and inform her that was not anywhere within the realm of reason. So she tried going to me instead. My reply was basically to laugh at her. She informed us if we couldn't make the atmosphere ""family appropriate"" she wouldn't be attending. I told her she would be missed and hoped she could find a sitter for next year.

After that we noticed we just didn't have much in common with our friends who were now parents. So we started hanging around people much younger than us (no kids), much older than us (Kids out of the house), or other childfree couples (not exactly common in Kentucky) but found we have much more fun.

So maybe they more outgrew up than we outgrew them, but tomayto tomahto.

EDIT: For those worried about mixing alcohol and firearms. The firearms are only used under my direct supervision, and we have a breathalyzer. If you blow anything over a .02 (4x below the legal limit), or refuse to blow, you are not allowed to handle firearms. And before I start drinking, the firearms go away for the day, locked in the storage room."

All of the dishes and most of the basics (flour, salt, sugar, spices, etc.) were mine and I did not mind sharing them because they are cheap. But why would you rearrange the kitchen of a house you don't live in? I'd constantly have to ask where things were, which was annoying because ITS MY OWN DAMN KITCHEN.

I also walked in on her leaving my cast iron skillet, which had just become nicely seasoned, in a sink of water. I pulled it out and told her it will rust. Came back later and she was using a scouring pad on it. Told her if she doesn't stop right now I'll use that scouring pad on her face. That was the one thing I asked people not to use that I own, because cast iron takes a bit of work and not many people my age really cook with it regularly."

3835,"WWII my grandfather was in Africa them sent to invade Italy at some beachhead for a couple months then farther north where he fought the SS as a machine gunner destroyed a nazi supply truck and stayed behind to do it. He always said it was just my turn on the gun at that moment they would have done it for me. Ended up captured and put into a stalag for 90 days until VE day. They rushed him to a hospital in France for malnutrition. I have a book he wrote with some other pows. If there's any interest in this post I'll find it tonight when I get home and post some more details.


Edit: just got home found the book. Looks like if it was published it was by river road press. 
The title on the cover is: Rudy rudolph an average American combat infantry soldier. The Italian beach head was anzio. Looks like he was in 4th infantry divison 157th regiment 3rd battalion as a machine gunner in M company of the heavy weapons divison. 

He thought he'd be in a jeep the whole time and was suprised to have to carry the MG.

It wasn't a supply truck it was a tank and was spotted had an 88 mm she'll fired directly at their position and lost a battle buddy. That's where he got the purple heart the blown up truck was after this. He was flown to Naples then sent to southern France where his company advanced north. He received a bronze star on Sept 15 1944 near loire France for remaining on his machine gun even during small arms fire. The report included in the book says he set one enemy troop carrier on fire and destroyed two others killing or wounding many of the enemy troops. January 20th he was on a hill with M company when the Germans surrounded and captured him he was sent to stalag XII-A. They made him and others sleep in the horse barn. On 4/28 1945 an English tank crashed through the fence. The British evacuated him to brussels for delousing then to a hospital in Paris. Oct 13th 1945 he was discharged from ft Leavenworth ks.


Edit 2 looked into into the publishing of this book looks like it wasn't I found a local news article but all it has is a phone number to purchase a copy. I could not find it on amazon or anywhere else.

3868,"**Ryanair**

Cheapest airline? Tickets not too cheap relative to other airlines, pay for priority check-in which is busy anyway and to allow you to carry your hand luggage in the plane. Even if you don't have a luggage in the hold, they'll take your hand luggage unless you pay so you end up waiting for it for 2h since Ryanair is shit. If you travel with someone, they will assign random seats unless you pay. And by random, it will assign totally opposite seats. (8D and 31D on my last flight). If you want to stay near your loved one you will pay min of £8 up to £22. Buy expensive shitty food (Burrito that was literally wrap with scrambled egg and a bit of bacon). Most uncomfortable seats and you have to print your ticket in advance or have it on your phone. Failing to do so they will charge you £40. Their gates are also at the very end of any airport, no jetty so you have to either take a bus to the plane or walk in the rain.  


Edit: People are quick to defend the 'budget' airline and tell me to not expect any perks or services from one.  


Yes, don't expect perks, but when they actively try to fuck you over so you pay extra, get you delayed every time in one way or another, rude employees when asking questions or asking for help, it is not over the top to expect a nice experience rather than a shitty service altogether. All in all, I'd rather pay extra on another airline. OP asked which airline won't see another dollar from me and I said that, including reasons that made me decide to NOT use Ryanair again. "

3951,"A couple of summers ago I got super shitfaced at a show and went back home. I lived alone and didn't have any food, but had a surplus of booze seeing as I was a hardcore alcoholic.

But suddenly I realized I was really hungry.

So I proceeded to do what I did multiple times a week: head to the Little Caesar's dumpster and score some pizza, maybe some chicken wings if I was lucky.

The journey was only a couple blocks away, but I was a lazy fuck and decided to ride my bike there. There was a gas station next door so I'd wait until no cars were in my line of sight to catch me in the act. I tucked my bike behind the dumpster and literally dove in, tearing in and scavenging.

To anyone who hasn't done this before--at the end of the night they would just toss in whole boxes of pizza and such that they weren't able to sell...so it was gross, but not suuuper nasty by any means.

Anywho, I remember jubilantly whispering ""yessss"" because I scored a couple of untouched supreme pizzas.

My mistake was my hubris. 

I didn't even need a whole pizza--but in the moment, my reasoning was I had to take advantage of this surplus dopeass supreme pizza, and take it all home to last for the next week.

On top of that I grabbed a couple boxes of cheese/pepperoni pizza, because I figured I'd skin the cheese and toppings from the top of these to transplant on top of the supreme slices in order to create the perfect drunken meal.

I should have just walked, and held the boxes in one hand while I guided my bike with the other.

But nope.

I got on my bicycle and balanced four boxes of pizza on one hand while I guided the handlebars with the other.

So pretty much I looked like a shitfaced circus performer doing a balancing act, feeling the wind whip through my hair as I sped as fast as I possibly could on my bicycle back home in the middle of the street--and half way there I ride straight into a fucking curb next to a street corner.

Dude, it happened so fast, I tried to bail ship and my lower leg/foot hit the edge of the curb as I was thrown to the ground.

I just laid there moaning in pain, next to my jacked up bike and an explosion of four dumpster pizzas splayed around me in someone's front yard.

I swear I saw someone peek through their blinders and close them again.

When I finally got up, I couldn't put any weight on my leg without experiencing searing pain, and my bicycle's front wheel was jammed, so I grabbed what pizza I could salvage (I shouldve just left it but I wasn't going to let a broken leg be in vain) and threw it in a box and tucked it sideways under my arm, and used the bike as a crutch to get home--as in, picking it up one step at a time for support while yelping in pain.

So, yeah--I got home and immediately chugged down a half pint of gin thinking it would help and maybe I was just psyching myself out and this injury really wasn't that bad?

But then it kept getting worse so I called my two best friends (married couple) to take me to the E.R.

Goddamn champions, they showed up with their baby in the carseat and the first thing she says is 

""holy fuck how drunk are you??""

""Baraehhhhsgaixbsk"" I politely replied.

Anywho. 

Got to the hospital. 

Got shot up with a bunch of morphine. 

Got an X-Ray. 

Turns out I didn't break anything.

Just severely bruised the skeletal muscle or something.

The bill was like $2000. 

Walked with a cane for a couple of weeks. 

My foot still gets limpy sometimes.

I've still never broken a bone to this day and can't imagine what it'd be like, because just that injury alone felt fucking terrible.

And that's probably the dumbest way I was ever injured--thanks for reading my tale.

Who ever didn't die initially probably starved and if you think logically the zone was probably quarantined after they couldn't kill them and figured everyone in the zone was dead.

4040,"My childhood home is haunted.

Where my house is, there used to be another house. It burned down, and the father of the family who lived there died in the basement during the fire. The family sold the land, and the house was cleared away and a new house built over the old basement. My grandmother, who lives in the same town, knows the family.

Anyways, my parents bought the new house when I was a toddler and we've lived there for ~20 years. The ghost of the guy who died in the fire, named Charlie, lives in our house, and it's pretty obvious.

My mom says that once, when she and my dad were arguing, she took to the bedroom to cool off. She said, ""Charlie, I wish you could knock some sense into him!"" Not five minutes later, my dad starts swearing from the living room. The shelves above his chair had fallen and knocked him in the head. They've never fallen before or since.

Any animal we have -- a couple dogs when I was a kid, my cat now -- will stare down the hallway for long stretches of time, then go bananas chasing something from the living room at one end to the bedrooms at the other, like they're playing with someone.

I personally have heard footsteps -- big, heavy footsteps, like someone wearing workboots -- walk up and down the hallway, especially at night. It scared me as a kid, but now I just take it as Charlie checking on our safety.

My grandmother, while visiting us one time, woke up in the guest bedroom to a shadow man standing in the doorway. She hid under the blanket for a few minutes, then decided it was safe. When she came out of the blanket, the shadow man was at her bedside, leaning over her. She hid under the blanket again until she fell asleep.

The most concrete evidence for me was the time Charlie scared something off. My bedroom was always the coldest room in the house, and often I felt uncomfortable in there, like I was sitting next to someone who disliked me. One day, I went to grab clothes for a shower, and walked right into a wall of evil halfway down the hall. I can't describe it fully -- nothing looked different, I just felt like I had physically crossed a barrier into a forcefield of hatred. I knew without a doubt in my body that I was in danger, and without thinking, I hauled ass to the opposite end of the house, to the kitchen. I stood at the stove, shaking -- I was about 14 -- afraid to look down the hallway in case i saw whatever was down there but afraid that if I didn't look, it would sneak up on me. I eventually convinced myself that I was being a baby, and started slowly through the dining room and towards the hall, afraid the entire time.

All at once, I felt a strong breeze blow by my left side, going down the hall towards my room -- like how it feels when someone runs by you and barely avoids running into you. And I thought for a second that I heard a man's voice. I continued down the hall, and I couldn't feel the evil anymore. I went into my room, and it felt lighter and more comfortable than it ever had in my life. I thanked Charlie, and from then on, I've never felt that uncomfortable feeling in my room. I think he protects it now.

In text you only have punctuation and that can be ambiguous. An exclamation point can be excited or angry. If I put a lil face of the appropriate emotion I know I'm getting my point across clearer, to my friends at least. "

When our waitress came over to ask us if we'd like to order appetizers, we asked what the daily oysters were. She said ""Yes, we have oysters today."" When we asked her to clarify on the kind of oysters, she made some vague comment about the fact that they just came in that morning and she didn't know.

So one evening my parents and I were leaving the park and a very black couple were walking past us. Naturally I asked with my normal lou voice ""Why are those people black?"" My mother quickly shushed me and told me you can't ask why people are black that's how they are. I was genuinely confused and felt like something happened to those people because they were not like anybody else. I'm pretty sure they heard, don't know if they understood or how they took it because I never saw their reaction.

4088,"My alcoholic, gambling addicted dad had saved so many lives and was an actually good human being

He was a surgeon for 20 yrs in one of the top hospital in the country. But the corruption is/was so widespread throughout the country that if you have a family member in the ER, you better pay some kickback to the nurse and doctor if u want them to take care of your dying member. If you are poor and unable to pay, most likely your family member will not survive.  My dad, on another hand, hated corruption and would never accepted it, he banned his team from receiving kickback as well. He would tried to save anyone who came to his care. So at his funeral, around 3-400 people came and said final thank you to my dad. But one person stand out the most for me was this old man. He told us that when he got out of prison, he had no money, no family and when he went to the ER after getting into some serious accident, my dad went beyond to save his life, and tried to get the hospital to forgive his medical bill.

But none of our sibbling really had any good relationship with him when he was still alive"

There was a homeless guy who like to sleep in the entryway to our apartment complex, but that wasn't so much the problem. The problem was he would relieve himself in the entryway and then threaten to throw his feces at people if they didn't pay the ""toll"" of a dollar to enter and leave the building. He would also harass women sexually, try to pull on their dress skirts as they went by, have screaming fights with other homeless people at 1am outside these people's windows, etc. The police were called frequently but they never took him in, I suppose because they thought he was just looking to get arrested for a meal and some shelter.

At any rate, several of the landlords got together and decided to let everyone know it would be perfectly acceptable if they wanted to use the hose just inside the door to ""wash off the walkway"" any time so long as another tenant wasn't coming up the stoop.

4171,"There's not a one size fits all approach here as women are different people with different likes and dislikes. That being said, a few things might improve your chances. People throwing out ""be attractive"" as an answer are saying more about the way they perceive women than they are about women themselves. Obviously appearance isn't a non-factor, but it's about more than features/weight. Are you decently groomed? Do you dress sloppily? Do you practice basic hygiene? For me personally, the creep factor is largely based on someone's mannerisms and the way they approach.

It might help to approach her if there are other people nearby. Having a random man walk up to me on the street when there's no one else around makes me immediately go on the defensive. It probably sounds silly to people who haven't experienced it, but what if I try to gently turn him down and he loses his shit? I want there to be people nearby to witness it or help if needed.

You could also offer her your number and give her time to think about whether or not she wants to contact you. Something like, ""Hey, can I give you my number? I'd like to get to know you better. If not, that's absolutely fine, have a great day."" This would avoid them having to make a quick decision about a person they don't really know, puts the ball in her court, and makes you look better by indicating that you're not going to be terrible about being rejected.

It helps to not be too pushy, because people who demonstrate that they don't take ""no"" for an answer tend to be awful. If she says no, hey, you tried, and someone else will probably like what she doesn't. Good luck out there."

4175,"There was an animated movie or anthology that featured a small devil man with red horns (possibly a centaur?) chasing naked women and bouncing boob balls (yes, a literal ball of boobs that bounced) through the countryside. I believe it was part of an anthology, where each vignette was selected by kids interacted with a crystal ball held up by a dragon claw. It was probably made sometime in the 80s, as I remember synthesizer music. My memory is poor, but it definitely exists, and no one believes me so I must find it!

It is \*not\* Fantasia, which did feature a centaur, but lacks the bouncing boob balls. I've spent a ridiculous amount of time Googling ""bouncing boob ball devil dragon claw crystal ball"", and have probably maxed out the number of watch lists I'm on. I will seriously PayPal $50 USD to the first person that finds this movie!

EDIT!!!: I found the movie, it's ""Allegro Non Troppo"" from 1976, and it is a parody of Fantasia. I remembered that the devil man walked on two legs, which makes him a Sartyr, not a Centaur. A quick google search turned it up, complete with boob and leg balls - [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfVJVwG4CKw#t=15m35s) starting at the point I remembered.

4190,I was just scrolling through looking for this because it struck me that this thread is significantly less rapey than these threads usually are
4191,"Freshman year of college, 5 of my bro friends signed up for zumba. Half of them were wearing fruit patterned fruity gym shorts. We took up the front row and were the absolute *worst* at it. 

I lost thirty pounds that semester I was having so much fun."
4192,"Sounds like my ex too, except I don’t miss her anymore because I met up with her t catch up after a year and I’m so happy I’m out of that relationship now.  I was constantly doing things for her and I’d get nothing in return.  It’s not like I was doing those request to get something, but just the constant can you do this for me and nothing ever for the last year of our relationship really sucked."
4193,"And now time's tough for him. He had to get a job to help pay to feed his children. Now the word ""ahoy"" haunts him."
4194,"I think Harry and Ginny (from the books, the movies portrayal of their blossoming romance was atrocious) were great together and here's why:

1. Ginny doesn't put up with Harry's mood swings and general snappiness. She stood up for herself and would take Harry down a peg or two the way he needed to be. Compare that to Hermione - who was at times terrified of Harry, and it's clear that Ginny handles Harry and his tantrums quite well. She was feisty as hell and I imagine Harry would need that in a partner to keep him level headed.

2. Ginny's crush began as a celebrity obsession, but she outgrew that and learned to treat and see Harry the way she does anyone else. Harry started developing feelings for Ginny only after she started being herself and figuring out who she was. In the books, this makes plenty of sense. Their relationship develops over years and while Ginny never truly got over him, her feelings for him developed into something more than a celeb crush.

3. The only 2 people in the books that were possessed by Voldemort were Harry and Ginny. No one else knew what it was like and it was something that connected them on a pretty deep level.

4. They both like Quidditch...so much so Ginny played for the Holyhead Harpies after Hogwarts. I would imagine Harry admiring the hell out of her for it, too.

5. Ginny knew what Harry needed when he needed it. I mean, she loved him like crazy and knew he needed to go after Voldemort and told him it was okay. I would imagine it would have been incredibly painful, not knowing if she would ever see him again. And yet, the whole time, was finding ways to fight against Voldemort while she was still in school (eg. trying to steal the sword of Gryffindor from Snape's office and just generally being a badass with Neville and Luna). She was fucking tough. That't what Harry needed.

I'm sure there's more, but that's what I can come up with at the moment."

4202,Well if we just pop a pair of wings on Angel style the human body wouldn’t be strong enough to flap and create lift even if we were to have glider wings where we’d have to take a running jump we’d need a wing span of about 72 feet. So we’d still need magic powers to fly.

"
4227,"A standout example of this is Katara. In the end of book 1, she sets to prove to master Paku that she deserves to train under him and learn to fight, and she does so by confronting him and challenging him to an actual duel.

The fact that they had her lose the fight is such a powerful way to drive home the point. She didn't win, but she still put up a damn good fight and proved that she was just as worthy as anyone else to train under Paku.

And aside from that, none of her best moments even once drive the point that she's a girl and is sticking it to the man, she's just a well rounded character with traits and flaws who is also a girl. "

4253,"&gt; I remember hearing about the Guardians of the Galaxy movie and being like ""There is absolutely no fucking way they are turning that one into a film and if they do, they won't have the tree or raccoon character.""

I was so wrong about the film as well. I knew a little bit about the characters but it's such an absurd concept, easy as hell to blow off because it's stupid. Talking raccoon? Green chick? Weird 80's obsessed dude with mommy and daddy issues? A one word tree? All of that sounds dumb as fuck but thankfully Gunn and company were able to make a fun film out of a not well known marvel property. "

4255,"Once worked at a Dunkin’ Donuts...

Every Dunkin “makes” the doughnuts 1 of 2 ways
- The come frozen, are thawed, and iced/filled
- the donuts are actually MADE by hand from dough

We had to clean the coolatta machine every night and spray it with water after every drink made.

It’s hard to choose just one thing. If the store is always slow, I’d say stay away from the food/espresso. The food will mostly sit in the hot holding for a crazy amount of time. The espresso machine’s beans are hardly ever changed on time because changing the beans is one of the least important things tbh."

4264,Some people say drugs are a victimless crime. They dont affect anyone so why do we have laws against it.  These stories are why I personally believe that drugs do have victims.  These stories here are stories I see play out in my neighborhood and these families are the victims.  While I will agree locking people up isn’t a solution.  Something different has to be done. This country has been locking people up for decades yet nothing changes.

4266,"This is one of the biggest secrets. It is so incredibly difficult for men to show emotion like that in front of people. One of the only things that will make me cry without fail is watching another guy cry. All I can think about is how much pain a guy must be in to cry where he can be seen, and how long he’s been holding it inside too. Every time I watch Good Will Hunting I cry when Robin Williams tells Matt Damon it’s not his fault over and over again, and Matt Damon just breaks down weeping. That always gets to me."

4280,"It was deer hunting season. My sighting occurred after a small nap in the woods. I was getting back on the main trail when this wall of smell hit my nostrils. It was like someone hadn't bathed in their entire life. I then heard this rustle in the woods. It was about 40 yards from me to this small ridge in the woods and I watched as this large (6'8'') figure stood up and took off down the ridge. It was bizarre because it was wearing some neon yellow object around its waist. I noticed there was no white tale that popped up like deer normally have when they take off running and this creature didn't jump at all like deer normally do. 

My dad saw something similar a few days later. First was the smell, then some sticks breaking, and finally the figure running at an incredible speed an no white tail.

4293,Is he still working there? 
4294,"Worked in Fast Food.  Sounds a bit like ""Is a Slut"".

... I'm actually kinda ok with that.

Being a proud Slut employee, I had fantastic metrics across the board... though it wasn't hard because of nepotism in the store.  Everyone but me and two other people (the guy who hired me, and his best friend) were members of the same family.  Small town, sorta happens... but everything was shit because of it.

One guy comes in drunk every day, and drinks through his shift.  Leaves his beer cans in the ice bay beneath the fountain for the drinks.  Eventually called the cops on him doing so, after a particularly bad incident involving yelling at a family.

So the regional manager comes in to talk to us...  especially to me, because I've been written up three times and I'm to be fired.

Er... what?  Hold the fucking phone.  With a single exception of spilling a drink on a customer, I've made roughly no mistakes in my nine months here... and no one's said a damn thing about anything, and these are all performance writeups?

They forged my signature on my write-ups, and backdated them.  I never heard a thing about this.  But getting one of the family sent to jail for public intoxication in violation of his parole after killing a guy... apparently that's a nono.

Solid forgeries though... except that, for my initials, they copied the capitals of my signature, when I use different initials for initialing things.  And that's shown on my ID, and on my acceptance signatures for the handbook.

I took one look at ""my"" writeups, tore off my shirt, threw it in the bitch's smug face, thinking she'd won, and screamed at her for the forgeries.

Regional manager tried to smooth things over.  I told him to fire her on the spot and then I might be willing to talk.  He said ""well... I can't"" and then I walked the fuck out.

Lawyers had a blast, especially after I was like ""I'm more than happy to sign over whatever you win.  This isn't about me getting rich, this is about them burning for it."""
4295,"I did something similar in a MASSIVE intersection... The ""go straight"" lights turned green, so I start driving. Then I realized (too late) my left turn light was red...

I started screaming stuff like ""NO NO NO OH MY GOD NOOOOO"" and gunned it because that was my only option!

Got pulled over immediately. The cop walks up absolutely losing his shit laughing because I didn't realize my windows were open through this whole ordeal. He let me go and said he couldn't wait to tell his buddies about this one. "

I was young (18?) and just had no idea. Now I always always always put a hand to my chest when I bend over if I'm wearing any type of gappy top. Ugh. And I try to be more self-aware. That was a huge eye-opening moment for me, taught me the lesson of a lifetime.

4360,"When my son was little he was nervous about going to the beach because of the scar on his chest from open heart surgery when he was a baby. I told him that if anyone asked about it to tell them that he was in a shark attack. Growing up anytime anyone asked him about the scar he said, ""I got attacked by a shark but don't want to talk about it."" 

He's a teen now and doesn't care about the scar anymore. He's athletic and is frequently shirtless even when friends are over. This summer a newer friend to the group asked about the scar while they were on the trampoline. Another one of my son's friends chimed in that it was a shark attack but to not bring it up anymore because my son doesn't like talking about it. My son laughed and said something like, ""Wait, did you think that was actually true? The scar is from heart surgery when I was little."" A few of his other friends were shocked by the revaluation as well and they spent the next 30 minutes arguing about who was the dumbest for falling for it. I was on the deck barbecuing and was trying hard to contain my laughter. Never thought that story would last until the teen years. "

He said they were rude and arrogant, whether they were simple rednecks or educated gentlemen. The commander was also from the south and overlooked their behavior.

Although I don't recall him being fond of black people, none in the family recall that he had hatred for them.

4448,"Yeah I definitely don’t think giving oral is a walk in the park for anyone, but it’s definitely different working with a penis. If you give oral to a woman, I imagine the breathing problem can be resolved by having her lay on her back. But with penises, they directly block your airway so the only position that resolves that is one where you’re not deep throating, but then that can compromise the quality of the blowjob. 

I also think the stretching and sucking part is hard. It’s like when you’re at the dentist - you’re fine at first, but after about 15 or 20 minutes of having your jaw stretched to an unusual position, it starts aching. Making it worse with blowjobs, you have to apply pretty decent suction while doing that, which makes the jaw pain worse. And your neck starts hurting on top of all this. 

I’m not trying to turn this into a “oral is easier for guys” sort of thing, I think you just don’t fully understand why your girlfriend doesn’t keep sucking if it’s not doing much for you. I’m a blowjob enthusiast and will gladly suck my man’s dick every day if he’s in the mood, but I still stop after about 20 minutes if he’s not gonna cum from it. And it’s not from being discouraged, it’s just from being tired because it really is a strenuous activity. Now, if he’s about to cum, that gives me the motivation to keep working through the pain and exhaustion, but if he’s not, then I’d rather relax and breathe. So try not to think of your girlfriend as a quitter or giving up; she’s probably doing the best she can. "

I love making weather apps because the weather is so unpredictable - there's so much that we could do with our phones but we don't and it's frustrating. Basically every phone has weather sensors in it but nobody is using that for weather forecasting! There are billions of phones in the world with barometers, some with hygrometers, thermometers, and all with light sensors, magnetic sensors, etc that could be used to measure the weather! I hope that some day these billions of phones could all contribute to a forecast system and create more accurate weather forecasts.

So I love to make weather apps because there is so much nobody has done and it's so important! But it's a dream job too because who pays for a weather app haha! That's okay, at least I can make interesting weather apps in my free time!

Edit: Okay so I'm making a hobby app that's going to do automatic tagging of weather in outdoor photos, based on machine learning from analyzing tagged photos of the sky that users send in. Starting with this labelled dataset I think I could make every outdoor photo ever taken into usable historical (and current) weather data.

4509,"I had a friend who was also our neighbor growing up. We were friends in elementary school. Once middle school started and we had other kids from other schools, she distanced herself, and I was too dumb to understand. Fast forward to 6th grade, and she and her new friends had about 20 plus of our peers, boys and girls write me notes and put it in my locker. They said various things like ""We hate you"" ""You're fat"" ""You're ugly"" ""Why don't you die"" ""Go do us a favor and kill yourself"" ""You are a disgusting loser who needs to die"" ""We wish you would just kill yourself so we don't need to see your fat face"" etc. It really really fucked me up inside. And her and her group of girls would whisper and laugh. I did not know what to do with the notes, my mom found them in my backpack. She taught at high school so she wanted to go to the principal but I begged her not to. Needless to say the rest of my school years were horrible. I hated going to school for the last 6 years until I graduated. It still fucks me up and I had like no self esteem, or trust still with people. Yah, many of you probably say they were kids and get over it, but I can't. I have wanted to kill myself many times, I never would have, but I fantasized about it. In one positive way, I have always rooted for any underdog, helped anyone who was being bullied, and fought for anyone who is treated differently. Because I know how evil people can be. And I know how schools are not safe."

4514,"I was at a initial appointment with a new primary care doc because my old primary care doc had turned her practice into a boutique practice and stopped accepting insurance. In the course of the ""getting to know you"" banter, the new primary care doc decided that I'd used a word incorrectly. He literally said that - ""You're using that word incorrectly."" When he stepped out, I pulled up m-w.com, wrote down the literal definition of the word I'd used (that was in alignment with my usage of it), and bounced. Found a new new primary care doc and never returned.

Even if I had used the word incorrectly, I don't see how it helps to build doctor/patient relations to point it out. Maybe the visit should be about my healthcare, not about some dude trying to prove he's smarter than me."

She didn't like where I was going, so I said OK, you name the place as long as it's not too far.  (We were in a city with tons of cheap restaurants nearby.)  She declined.  I offered to take her to a convenience store and pick some things out.  She declined.

To be clear, I was a young woman, so I don't think I posed a sexual or physical threat.  That and a few other unsavory encounters has made me suspicious of panhandlers.  Now I just give them directions to the nearest homeless shelter or charity."

Prehistorically, there was a lot of Native Anerican activity so depending on where you are you might find areas where they mined for raw material for tools, ceremonial areas with lots of rock art or geoglyphs (cleared areas that show a pattern visible from above), trails, and camp sites/villages. It may look inhospitable today, but hundreds of years ago, there was more water for plants and animals so people had a easier time surviving.

She would climb up measure it again, climb down and move the pillow a little to the left, a little to the right until she felt it was in the perfect spot. 

On her last climb to the bed we figured what she was going to do but no one stopped her. She waved her arms like she was preparing to take a dive off a diving board jumped off the bed while screaming “Peter Pan!” and lands face first onto hard cement floor. Face completely misses the pillow. 

My cousins and I don’t even bother checking on her. I’m still sure she knocked herself out for a few seconds until she started screaming her head off causing all the adults including our mother to rush into the bedroom. Has a cut on her head, busted lip, bruised face. Luckily no missing teeth.

- Guys are variable on sleep. This is similar to routine. I barely sleep during the week, but love to sleep in on weekends.

- Guys are usually horny all the time. Usually is key word. And yes, it's the same craving as being hungry or thirsty. Most of the time, I can have a drink. Every so often, I'm just not thirsty. I can guarantee you though I'll be thirsty later.

- We like to do things. Whether it's work or hobbies, it's stuff to do.

4610,"Dude, I was in the exact same position as you in almost the exact same time frame ago.

She had a shitty upbringing until her grandparents took her in. After that she dropped out of high school and was spoiled by her grand father.

* I was repeatedly compared to her ex that “abused” her.

* Flipping out over trivial things, or things that weren’t true. For instance I was paying and driving for us to get a pizza at midnight to the only place that was open 25 minutes away. She slammed doors and *screamed* that I didn’t care about her because I didn’t want pineapples on the pizza. I went and got it anyway, and the entire time I was gone she was in fetal position on the bed facing away from me. 

* Constantly going through my phone and asking about every girl and how I know them. She would always be behind me while I was on my phone and looking at the screen. She even took it out of my hands once and scrolled through the conversation I was having with my friends because I was laughing while texting.

* Her abusive ex overdosed and she used all her vacation and sick time at *her new job* to take care of him in the hospital 2 months *after I moved her in with me* to get her out of that environment. 

* She broke up with me one night. She sat on the couch right next to me, stared at the wall, and said “I can’t do this anymore.”

“Can’t do what?”

“I can’t date you anymore. I don’t know why, I just can’t.”

Then she gets up, goes into the bed room, and goes to sleep. She never gave me an explanation why. The next morning I’m sitting on the couch and she *leaps* on me. She’s being very loving. Hands rubbing my body, smiling wide, kissing my cheeks and in general being very affectionate which is out of the norm for her. When I told her I wanted to talk about what she said last night she puts her finger over my lips and says “Shhh shh shh, just pretend that didn’t happen.”

I could write a novel about the ungrateful, twisted shit this girl did to me in 7 months and how much of myself I sacrificed to try and make her happy. The final straw was her acting like I never did anything for her. After taking her to doctor appointments, moving her in with me to get her away from abuse, going on a ski trip, paying for everything except half of rent, encouraging her to get her education that she always wanted, and spending months together laughing about stupid shit like the weird noises the dog toys made and her putting make up on me, she told me nothing I did for her ever mattered.

After I broke up with her she started to put her hands on me and tried to get me jumped. I never hit her, but I totally understand why her parents didn’t want her around anymore and why her ex’s treated her the way they did. 

She told me *after* we broke up that she’s bi-polar, but everything else points to BPD.

I hope you’re doing good, man. I’m still struggling a little."

Anyways, this wasn't a case of me leaving my comfort zone, but rather my comfort zone being invaded while I was tripping. It was my best friend's place, and we had it all to ourselves. His dad was shacked up with wife #3 up the street. I loved being there, great balcony, we'd smoke up a lot on the balcony and enjoy the view, drink coffee, play cards. Anyways, this one time we dropped acid, which was fine for me so long as I'm in my comfort zone. But, this one time my friend's sister, who did not live there but sorta had ""rights"" to the place (she technically had a room), showed up with a shitload of her friends. I was not comfortable with that. At all! I was paranoid, I was tripping bad, I was freaking out, I wanted help, I was ready to just call an ambulance. I can't remember how it ended, maybe we left and hung out somewhere. I just remember I was not liking it. I didn't do any acid after that, but shrooms a few times.

It wasn't until a few years ago I remembered this and it clicked that somebody had thrown a pigs head at one of them them in their shop because they're a muslim family."

4665,"this one actually just happened recently. 

I (finally) got around to reading the left/right game and told my bf Luis about it, so we decided to play for shits and giggles since we like driving around listening to music anyway. After getting a little lost making the turns, we ended up in this old orange grove. We didn’t know that there were any “farms” near us, as we figured we were still somewhere in our home town which isn’t really a rural area so it struck us as a bit strange. We decided that since it was a nice night, we would walk through the trees to explore (and maybe fool around a bit). When we stepped off the path and out into the trees, we noticed that the floor was absolutely covered in rotted, old oranges, like there was no maintenance of this place at all. Shortly after, we noticed a red truck drive past us, but didn’t think too much of it. 

Being adventurous, we decided to have some fun trying to walk over the oranges, until a terrifying shriek sounded just over my head. I was scared shitless, but Luis had seen it was only a bat that flew right by me which is uncommon, but not unheard of in this area. A bit shaken, we headed back. As we approached the car, we both paused and noticed the red truck was stopped at the end of the road, it’s headlights on us. At this point I was more than a bit spooked, so I hopped in the car. The truck started to crawl its way down the path to us, and I begged Luis to get in the car, but being the “tough guy” he was, he waited, thinking someone was fucking with us. Eventually the car passed us, going uncomfortably slow. The windows were tinted so we couldn’t get a good look, so I got Luis in the car and we left.

After about a 25 minute drive home, I looked up orange groves near me, and couldn’t find anything about one in that general location. Not too scary, just a bit of a strange experience..."

4687,"The body image issues are real and pretty serious. That stereotype about girls taking guys' hoodies exists because the idea of a woman buying an extra-large and thus, unflattering garment, no matter how warm and comfortable, is anathema to fashion and the concept that being pretty is the rent you pay as a woman to exist in society. Our own mothers may have warned us, at age eleven or younger, at a pediatrician-approved, medically okay size, that we needed to lose weight, just out of fear that we might grow up to be picked on, teased, or worst of all, single. Most of us were put on expensive skincare products to 'reduce the signs of aging' before our twenties. The harshest critics of our appearance are other women.  


The social equality issues are real and pretty serious. That stereotype about girls being afraid guys will rape and/or murder them while guys are afraid girls will reject them exists because yes, that actually happens, and by age seventeen at the latest, we tend to know at least one close, personal friend who has been sexually assaulted. Five out of eight women, that's the ratio. Our own fathers may have jokingly threatened our prom dates and boyfriends with homicide, leaving us wondering how come we didn't get any say in the matter, when we became property, and why marriage, of all the jobs in the world, was the one where zero experience made you the most desirable applicant. Our churches may have held balls to celebrate our sexual purity, implying that our worth as human beings was directly tied to nobody getting past the metaphorical clamshell packaging, and our coolest aunts might have said ""Fuck that shit, you're a person,"" and taken us to Planned Parenthood for legit sex ed, a Margaret Atwood paperback and a Girl Scout's first can of pepper spray. The harshest threat to our confidence may, in fact, be you, if you don't take into account that many women of legal-to-fuck age had some seriously fucked-up experiences as young women, that constant sexual harassment from male classmates, male bosses and even male religious and political authority figures has been our background radiation since before we needed underwires, and that we literally expect 5/8 odds of rape.  


And yet, somehow, most of us still genuinely like men.   


The secret, of course, is to treat us as if you had absolutely failed to notice that we are female. Just flunk that Spot check and befriend us as if we were just other dudes. Talk about shared interests. Be excited. Ask us to do fun activities. Plan projects together. Completely miss the hair and the lashes and the purse and the heels. If we aren't interested in you as a boyfriend, GOOD. You now have a female friend and our only hobby in life when the Internet is down is pairing off our single friends, PLUS you now have a chill lady-bro buddy to ask all these ""so, what exactly IS the deal with high heels?"" questions once you know one another well. Do this often enough, and out of your new pool of male, female and who-knows friends, at least one will be as attracted to you as you are to them in a romantic sense as well as a friendly sense.  


And then, once you find out just how serious the issues are for women, yeah, try not to go *too* far into being an Indignant Woke Bro. No matter how hot your wife thinks it is when you stand up in a PTA meeting and inform the arch-conservative religious parents that abstinence-only sex ed is the stupidest thing you've ever heard of, inquire sarcastically how the new rape-proof version works and announce that unless the school teaches the topic comprehensively and inclusively with attention to consent, harassment and the LGBT community, *your daughter will,* yeah, that's a rant best saved for after said child has, y'know, learned to read.  


That's the other big Girl Secret. Even if you learn a whole mess of intel about, say, the 1980-1990 batch, well enough to marry one, all it takes is the 2014 model year little girl to start you on a whole new path of brand-new confusion and wonderment once you become a dad.

4698,"I’ve written this somewhere before but Trump’s Cap Cana restaurant: Trump Cap Cana

Cap Cana is in the Dominican Republic and is supposed to be an ultra exclusive gated resort type area there. Apparently Lil’ Wayne “recovered” from his dental surgery prior to going to Rikers there. All of the resorts have multiple helipads, there’s a private petting zoo, you drive golf carts all around, etc. Anyway, my mother did a favor for someone wealthy (we’re firmly middle class) and they gifted her with a week there. She invites 6 friends  and I invite someone and off we go. Since we’re there for a girls’ vacation and didn’t have to pay for our accommodations, we decide fuck it, let’s go big. (We’d been eating amazing ceviche and some of the best chicken fingers and coconut based desserts I’ve ever had until this point.)

Trump’s restaurant is a top this mesa that overlooks the whole area and takes like a mile to get up on a winding road. There’s six (empty) helipads and an empty parking lot surrounding this ornate looking, dark wood, tropical-ish building - inside was just bowls of fake fruit and giant portraits of the man himself (no surprise really). There was no one else there and the staff spoke nor seemed to understand English so My 6 years of terrible Spanish came in handy. (Everywhere else everyone seemed to speak a variety of languages or at least understood them.) The place looked like it could comfortably host 100 and was staffed to do so. However, we were the only 8 people there. This meant we took a sip of water, it was refilled. Put a used fork down (gold, obviously), it was immediately replaced with a clean one - regardless if you were actually finished eating. This was highly annoying as conversations were being constantly interrupted with a white gloved hand reaching in front of someone. 

Then came time to order - we’d been there for 90 minutes at this point and had only been offered water &amp; bread. After explaining through a combination of poor Spanish and terrible pantomiming that I was allergic to mushrooms and another woman also had an allergy, we thought we’d successfully ordered. (The dish I ordered had no mushrooms but reusing a pan they were previously cooked in has set me off in the past and I didn’t want to have to go to hospital on vacation.) 45 minutes later, yup, you guessed it, my dinner came out smothered in mushrooms (it was a seafood pasta dish FYI) and my mother’s friend’s dish comes with a side of nuts (again not even listed on the dish as being an ingredient). She could at least eat hers as the nuts hadn’t touched her actual dish and my mom pulled the ultimate mom move and swapped with me. Two bites in I realized this was the blandest food I had ever had. Like eating raw pasta covered in over cooked tomatoes with over cooked lobster meat and some sort of seeds on it. A table of 8 boisterous women was brought to almost complete silence for a full minute. Then everyone bust out laughing about how horrible the meal was and what a waste of a night it was. 

We paid as fast as we could and got the hell out of there. We wound up at a beach “shack” (it still had flowy white linens acting as walls and tiny table top candles) eating chicken fingers with sweet chili mango sauce and drinking copious amounts of wine.  When the owner asked why we were eating so late (it was about 10:30 pm when we got to the shack after about a 10 minute drive...we got to Trump’s at 5:30pm) we told him where we had started our evening and he just bent over laughing to the point of tears and comped the next three bottles of wine.  We ate nearly every meal at that shack for the next four days we were there."

Getting it resolved was a nightmare because the airline wouldn’t do anything to help (according to the kiosk and phone dicks I had violated the terms and conditions and forfeited any reassignment or refunds).

I would like to mention that I didn’t call the police because I didn’t suspect any danger from him, I just thought he was being an asshole. I did call a close friend during the drive to let her know where I was and where I was going. Once we arrived, he told me to come inside his house and I refused and was getting my phone to call a cab (I couldn’t walk home since I didn’t know the area too well). It was absolutely ridiculous to see this guy ball up his fists and make this childlike tantrum face and swear at me that he was going to shout at the top of his lungs if I refused him. Fast forward, a week or so.. the guy would send me nasty text messages, talking to me like I murdered his family or something. He began to message my Facebook friends asking for me (really embarrassing!!) and showed up at my doorstep asking for me.

And as the HBO episodes slowly go through the years, the good in Tom loses its glow and he truly becomes lost as he realizes that he is not a mudblood but the true heir of Slytherin. Even as he glosses over the fact that there have been half blood and muggleblood Slytherins. 

And then further seasons with Voldemort’s rise, manipulations of the Ministry of Magic, and the Maurders, Snape, and Lily going to school at a time when the war is just about to begin as Dumbledore thwarts Voldermort’s insidious political influence to some degree. With the war being used by both sides to spread fear and cause political gain and influence. 

And finally Harry Potter goes to Hogwarts. I think Draco Malfoy as a main character would also be interesting. To see how he grows as a person and see that his parents truly love him despite Lucius serving the Dark Lord. "

4764,"I knew my grandfather was in WWII, but he never talked about it.  I tried to get the story out of him many times, but he kept mum on it. 
I stayed with my grandparents a couple weeks every summer. One summer I got very sick there, and asked my grandfather to tell his story.  He left the room, and came back with a world map and went through it all.  It was a fascinating story. He was a Buck Sergeant in the 29th Infantry and landed on D-Day.  He was shot and treated.  After being released from the hospital, he was offered a position as an interpreter in London, but opted to re-join his unit.  He was then captured and held as a POW.  The Russians eventually liberated them, but didn't provide and logistics to get them anywhere, basically just set them free.  He and another solider then had to 'Planes, Trains, and Automobile' it ad hock to get back to the American front and eventually America.

Again, an amazing story.  His memory was uncanny, down to exact dates.  When he told it to me, I thought, this just can't be between us, and encouraged him to write it down.  He did, and I have the hand written copy of the whole ordeal from basic training all through the war.  One of my cousins also typed it up for the rest of the family (with Gramp's permission)."

We were all very giddy, which I know now was a way to cope with the stress.

Edit: had to check, wasn’t where he was caught, but was where they tracked one of his phone calls. The gas station they tracked it to, and the wrong van the police held up, was down the street from my apt. We were all glued to the news waiting to find out if it was him.

4792,"The ""second event"" was what I saw and its explanation from Wikipedia:

&gt;The U.S. Air Force explained the second event as slow-falling, long-burning LUU-2B/B illumination flares dropped by a flight of four A-10 Warthog aircraft on a training exercise at the Barry Goldwater Range at Luke Air Force Base. According to this explanation, the flares would have been visible in Phoenix and appeared to hover due to rising heat from the burning flares creating a ""balloon"" effect on their parachutes, which slowed the descent.[19] The lights then appeared to wink out as they fell behind the Sierra Estrella, a mountain range to the southwest of Phoenix.

They waited 10 years to come out with this explanation when they could have done so much sooner. The biggest reason I have an issue with it is: why was a flare drop exercise classified...for 10 years?"

So that's 1 kg, a fighter weighs 10 tons easy , so that's 5.000 atomic bombs, and not the hiroshima ones, those were weak , (1 tzar bomb = 2500 hiroshimba bombs)

One of those bombs will flatten anything in a 5 km radius , just one of them. Even the biggest capitol ships have like 10km sizes.

You have everyone to hide from, thiefs, banks, gubernment and opportunist fellow citizens. if the cash is unmarked, then the key is to keep it down low, there is NO hurry.. If it is marked then there is very little hope . If it is, things are much harder and the kind of criminals who move large sums and smuggle all kinds of cash and can handle marked bills is exactly the people who should not know about it. It is also **the** most obvious source for that cash.

It would serve as eternal small piggybank making life easier but you would not be any richer. Kind of perfect scenario if you ask me.. If you get 750k lump sum legally, you will waste a LOT of it even if you take care of finances.

4831,"I gave a talk at a medical school about gender discrimination issues in healthcare, citing research on dozens of treatment biases down to the fact that men tend to get treated more quickly in emergency situations. I ended with a rough epidemiological estimate of how many excess deaths are caused for some treatments by not taking women seriously.

The doctor who came after me to give a talk admitted at the beginning that their paper on sex differences in complications after surgery didn't consider that physicians may hold gender biases. Afterward, a few of the med students told me they'd never read any research on healthcare discrimination for their courses and asked for recommendations so they could start a reading group. This was a top-50 medical school. It was alarming."

He would literally print out pictures and schematics of skyscrapers and try to talk about them with people in school while scattering Russian language into it all over.

Her brain was on the sidewalk and had fallen out as the father was running around screaming with the body. 

The older brother and sister were supposed to be watching her, but she crawled outside in the driveway somehow, and the mother backed over her head with the minivan. 

Typing this out conjures the images as though they were yesterday. It was very traumatic and so sad. Before they moved their home was broken into and their dog poisoned; but I think he lived. I felt badly for that family for years and wonder how they are doing now.

My department's supervisor (we make up most of the profit of the store and under previous GMs our supervisor was basically our boss with very little interference from the GM) is thinking of trying to transfer to a different store which would probably lead to a bunch of other people quitting, beyond those who already have or are planning to."

One thing is guaranteed, the world of Advertising is going to explode into a new era. Print will die when everyone starts wearing smart glasses or what have you. And every flat surface that is owned by someone will become available ad space in the same way that companies currently use display ads on the internet. 

On the bright side. People who choose to ""log off"" or whatever the term will be, will get to see a world devoid of advertisements. A blank billboard is going to be worth so, so much more money than a billboard with a single companies advertisement on it. Same goes for bus stops, walls outside concert venues, movie theaters, whatever. Posters will be torn down and blank walls will be kept clean so the digital marketing systems work. "

I got angry and told him we don’t fight people because they smile at us? He then explained that they were looking at train photos. The one kid looked at electric multiple unit trains and claimed it was a steam train. My son was adamant that it was not a steam train because it ran with electricity. The kid then went on to say that my son was wrong, that he would never be a train driver and that his family was a ‘shithead’. He said it with a smile. And I believed my son because he had never heard that word before in his life. I was trying my hardest not to grin at him fighting the other kid, while of course explaining that it would have been better to tell a teacher and/or me lol. "

So I told my roommate that she was coming over, dinner is in the freezer and left. No big deal right? Well apparently this was supposed to be our first date and she hoped for a romantic dinner.

4918,"I have been a middle school art teacher in a public school for 12 years. A few years ago, one of my eighth grade classes was working on a drawing project in which they could choose to draw anything they wanted after spending time developing drawing g techniques and experimenting with a variety of media. 

As we got closer to the end of the project, we have a class critique in which the students hang up their unfinished work and their peers discuss and give suggestions or just give positive encouragement (middle schoolers need to learn how to give and take criticism!) most of the work done in this class was on par with what’s expected from students that age; favorite cartoon characters, landscapes, portraits. One girl, who was a sweet bit awkward and shy student presented a drawing of her living room, with her on the couch watching tv. It was fine- a boring bit fine image that was totally normal. The other students gave her feedback such as “you should add value here, or maybe go over that part of the wall again”...boring but standard comments. 

A few days later, she turned in her drawing to be graded. I looked at it and I noticed she had indeed followed the suggestions of her peers, and had also added new imagery in her drawing:

A severed arm with blood under the couch. 
Blood spatter in the walls. 
A bloody axe on the floor. 
A disembodied leg on the couch. 
She was still pictures on her couch in the drawing, but was covered in blood and had a maniacal smile on her face. 

I said, “ OK, great! Looks like you added new elements to your drawing. Fill out your self-assessment paper and then I can get started on grading it.”  I didn’t want her to be alarmed and I didn’t want her to think I was judging her or scared of her (I absolutely was!). 

After school I went to one of the social workers who works with this student, and showed her the drawing. The social worker said she would meet with the student the next day. 
At school the next day, I spoke with the social worker and asked what happened- and the social worker laughed and said that she asked the student how things are going in art. 

STUDENT: fine, I like art! Ms.M is cool. 
SOCIAL WORKER: great! How’s it going at home? 
STUDENT: fine! Boring.
SOCUAL WORKER: ok. (They talk for a few more minutes, and SW isn’t getting anywhere. She decides to be direct and discuss the artwork) so, Ms. M showed me the drawing you just turned in...she was a little worried about it. What do you think about it? 
STUDENT: what? Oh my Halloween drawing? 
SOCIAL WORKER: yeah...it looked like there was some scary things happening...where did that come from? 
STUDENT: all the other kids said my work was boring and it needed more stuff, and I just watched some scary movies (it was around halloween) so I just decided to make it a horror drawing. 

Ahh...middle school!

4930,"A lot of people don't know all the details of the Michael Vick case.

Some people think he was just a rich guy who put some money down on dog fighting. Like he was just a gambler who wanted some weird and unique sport to bet on.

In reality, he was the Hitler of the canine world. His estate was filled with mass dog graves. There were dozens of dogs that were executed by hanging for no reason. He once threw a dog into a pit to be mauled to death in front of his kids in order to fuck with them. 

Seventy live dogs were seized from his estate. I know a number of them were 'rehabilitated' and actually went on to live their lives as household pets. Almost all were dog-aggressive and couldn't be around other dogs because of what they had endured, and many were people-aggressive because of the abuse they endured, which required euthanasia. 

I think about what happens when I eat cheese and crackers. My dog comes up to me and gives me those doggy-eyes; that's how he begs. He wants some of my cheese. I wonder how many of those dogs used those sad doggy-eyes to beg for their lives before they were drowned or electrocuted or shot with a handgun. "

4934,"Well I have this reccuring dream that I've been a serial killer my whole life but somehow repressed the memories. As I think back to each victim, I start to realize how petty my excuses were. Think the business card scene from American Psycho but worse - like somebody looked at me funny so I started following them and killed them. People i didn't even know, people who had entire lives that I destroyed.  

Usually I'm not doing the killing as the dream takes place after the fact, but in a couple of cases, I've definitely been chasing somebody down with a knife, thinking ""I don't want to kill this person, but now that they've seen me chase them with a knife, things can't go back to normal and they'll try to put me in jail"" so I keep chasing them.  

Then I wake up and it's a mix of ... ""WTF, brain?"" And ""OH THANK GOD""  

I also sometimes dream that I get so angry, I curse out my wife until she's crying, declaring that I've decided to divorce her. When I wake up I'm just happy to see her. My therapist would have a field day. "

The presentation was basically telling the class general facts about the illustrator, such as where they are based, where they went to school, and what their artistic process is like. One guy decided to show the class an artist that did anime style illustrations. As he was scrolling down the website to display more of the artist’s work, it appeared that this artist also specialized in drawing extremely detailed hentai.

5001,"A serious answer rather than people pissing on it. Essentially it is an amalgamation of study regarding gender in a number of fields, mostly in the humanities and social sciences. History, philosophy, literature, sociology, paychology those sorts of things. Typically this is seen in terms of how the nature of femininity has diverged from masculinity or otherwise been constructed. It tends to focus on a couple of different points, 1) contributions important women have made over the years which have been over looked. 2) What the norms for women are (and to a lesser degree men), how they might be good or bad, and how they might change etc. 

Another way to put it is that men have traditionally dominated all fields of study, and thus many of the ways those fields are conducted arguably have a distinctive masculine bend in terms of practice etc. Gender studies aims to answer the questions about what feminine takes look like. 

Obviously it was birthed out of and deeply tied to feminism, which as a social movement tackles these same issues in many ways. "

5007,"When I was around 7, my church went to a campground for our annual summer picnic. 

There was a children’s playground with monkey bars etc, slightly secluded from the main area surrounded by trees. After playing for a while, a man who I didn’t recognize came out from the bushes, and stood in front of my friend and I with an exposed erection. Literally just staring—hands on his hips. 


I had no idea what was going on or what an erection even was, but remember getting a weird feeling so I grabbed my friend by the hand and we went back to tell our parents about the strange man. They were livid, a few church members searched around for the guy but didn’t find him. It was decided at that point that the younger kids would have to be accompanied by the teens, and we returned to the playground under their supervision. The man ended up coming back and “peeing” near us.

I had not seen this thing in years, it must have been tucked away somewhere, but our dog found it while I was out of the house and when I came home there were cards everywhere, but the dog had only chewed up one card. All the others were intact and it was so strange and I had no clue what any of the cards are supposed to mean. So I googled it, the one card our dog chewed up and left on display for me to find when I got home was called the 5 cups, it features a person in a black shroud looking at 3 cups that have spilled over in front of them, and they are so overcome with grief they fail to notice the two cups still standing behind them.

5094,"My fiancee grew up in the cult. Apparently it does have some psychological tools that help people deal with some issues in their lives, but it's bogged down in bullshit pseudoscience that doesn't take downsides of the combinations of techniques into account, so the downsides are huge and numerous. On top of that, it insulates itself by forcing devotees to destroy relationships with non-cultists, so *if* they decide to leave, they have nowhere to go. To make matters even worse, the cult convinces people that they're saving the world, and inflate the numbers of cultists to make it look as if they're far closer to their goal than they actually are, which helps the organization sell the idea to current members. It does this by weakening members' ability to question what they're told, and convert any doubts they might have into personal flaws that need to be conquered internally. To make matters EVEN WORSE, part of the way they help people ""develop their skills"" involves recording members saying everything they've had an issue with in their lives, which invariably involves confessing to everything they've ever done wrong, and breaking it down to ""help them deal with it"". These ""auditing"" sessions (which use primitive polygraphs) are often so intrusive that the people being investigated will make things up to satisfy the ""auditor"", which is actually what led to the founder introducing the concept of past lives. The cult uses these confessions to discredit anyone who threatens to leave, and anyone who speaks out.

It's been said many times before, but it's a cult disguised as a religion, operating as a business."

5190,"There's something about rape that is just so much more haunting to me than other forms of abuse (physical, emotional, etc.). I think it has to do with the idea that to hit someone or say something mean to hurt them is done with the intent to harm. It's almost instinctual, but violent rape is an entirely different beast. 

It's so unbelievably intimate and invasive. In the best case, is done with the intent to take what the person believes is rightfully theirs, and reduces the victim to no more than an object and often has the intent of ""putting them in their place."" There's got to be some form of deep ingrained hatred of a whole group of people to be able to rape a random woman you have never met on the street.

Not saying those things aren't present in other kinds of abuse, of course, but the added sexual layer makes it so horrifying to me. Maybe because it's like physical and emotional abuse all rolled into one, plus more."

Instead of going to a hospital he showed up at practice, got dressed,  put on his skates, and immediately got bumped by a ref and fell down unable to get up. 

He got in a fight with his older brother who was a big ripped guy everyone called hoss. Hoss slept with the girl Big was hitting on and invited over to the house. She got there before big did so Hoss said he's not coming but why don't you come inside or something similar. Big walked in on them and was preping to kill his brother but he boxes too.   To win the fight Big to hoss''s car keys, climes a telephone poll using only his hands like a scene from mulan, and thumbtacked them up there. His brother being a hot head too hit him with a golf club breaking 3 ribs. Big tackled his older and much larger brother then hog tied him. Big then dragged his raging brother out of the house, to the curb, roped him to a no parking sign, put a sign that said ""free"" up and left him there over night... in philly...



But the funniest story my dad's friends tell about him is the time big got mugged leaving a bar, ended up beating up the 3 guys. The 1 guy ended up just fleeing but the other two tried to fight. Big kicked the shit out of them, took the guys gun (reason they stayed so long was to try to get it back), they decided to cut their losses, cracked big over the head with a wine bottle which was when my dad came out. Then the fled two blocks. They looked back at found big was about 40 feet behind them. He chased them for TWO MILES before they barricaded themselves in a phone booth and used it to call the police.

5241,"I dated a Pagan girl. She wasn't over the top or anything. She was intelligent and interested in science, and yet also believed in paganism. Spending that amount of time with someone and seeing those beliefs made me more open minded.

Then there was one night that did it for me. Her house is haunted, all of her family believe it. I walk down in the night a lot of times and it did always feel ""different"" somehow and I could never bring myself to walk into the living room. Several times we'd heard voices in there and things falling of the sofa.

Finally one night I woke up and she had just gotten back into bed and she was visibly shaking even through the dark, and when I touched her she was in a cold sweat. She was never scared of the ghosts, but apparently she turned to walk up the staircase and saw something just sitting at the bottom staring at the door. Seeing someone THAT shaken and scared first hand really changed my skepticism and now I always find myself second guessing things to do with ghosts."

5294,"I've broken my ankles 3x a piece. 

First time. School dance 7th grade. Slipped on a drink someone spilled and didn't say anything bout it and flipped and turned my ankle around when I landed.

2nd time. Same foot. 2 weeks after cast was removed, in P.E class and was doing jump rope and landed on the ball of my ankle. My foot was completely turned upward. When I looked down and seen the bottom on my shoe looking up at me I froze and called the coach over and he turned white and lost his shit. My mom came and picked me up and cussed me the entire way to the Dr office.

3rd time. Same foot. 3 months after 2nd cast came off. Was walking to my class and missed the step from talking and turned it just enough to cause a hairline fracture. 

Next foot.

First time. Broke it at football game 9th grade walking down these concrete blechers (if you wanna call them that) I stepped down and my foot turned and i want you to imagine holding 5 chicken leg bones and then simultaneous break them in half. That was the sound I heard. This black guy heard it sitting down where I stepped down and looked at me with big eyes and turned away and I had 4 more steps to make it and to walk around the track before I could get to my dad and mom. ... I made it down the steps and a quarter of the way before I collapsed and had my friend go get my mom and dad. Instead he gets the EMS workers and they come with a stretcher and load me onto it and take me to the ambulance and I wait for my parents. 


2nd time. Was during a horticulture class and we were walking through the woods and I slipped on a piece of wood and turned it. That was not a fun walk of a quarter mile.


3rd time. 10th grade. Broke it while helping band setup before a football game. Stepped in a divot walking back to the field house. Crack and baby fall down go boom. 

After this last time I've sprained them both more than a dozen times. My foot doctor (rip) told me that if I ever broke either one again that I would need to have the ball of my ankle took out and replaced with a steel ball and have about 6-7 pins put around and I would have to relearn how to walk again. 3-6 months rehab for it. I said if it does ever again happen I want them both done at the same time.

He was always super outgoing and friendly, and he never really had beef with anyone.

So junior year of high school he came back to school after one of these extended absences, and he was totally different. He didn't want to talk to anyone, and he was super on-edge and moody. Someone sat down next to him and he goes ""you can't sit there, my angel is sitting there."" Everyone thought that was weird as shit because 1. He was imagining someone there and 2. He had never talked about angels or religion or anything like that ever. He went the rest of the day only talking (whispering) to his ""angel"" and not talking to anyone else.

5383,"My opinions on this have waxed and waned.  I think of late especially (i.e. post-Jobs), they have definitely lost their way.  But the more tech advancement I see in my life, the more I come to appreciate the Apple technique.

In some sense, packaging together existing technology into an attractive package is, as you say, not really innovative.  But really, integration is one of the most difficult parts of this kind of engineering, and elegantly packaging up a bunch of disparate tech into an easy-to-use and reliable interface is its own form of innovation.  I believe it is possible to integrate and perfect so well that you are really doing something revolutionary.

The iPhone, for all that it copied previous things, was genuinely a market revelation and did really transform the public's ideas of what a PDA could be (and functionally introduced ""smartphone"" into the general lexicon).

People or companies who coalesce and perfect our advancements are probably doing more for tech spread and innovation than a lot of people expect, and I respect the engineering that goes into that task.  Turning, ""this thing someone did"" and ""this other thing someone did"" and ""this other, other thing ..."" into ""this one thing _everyone wants_"" is pretty cool."

When we returned, it was the year Apollo's Chariot opened. FAVORITE COASTER EVER as it turned out. We happily rode it several times and when it was near park closing, we went back in using the single-riders line and road it three times in a row. First ride, nothing, but second ride I look out to the side as we crest the big hill and realize I'm looking at the partially dismantled big hill of a massive blue coaster in the distance, lit up from underneath by lights.

It occurs to me I'm looking at Drachenfire's corpse. We had (happily) noticed it was no longer a ride available when we came to the park that vacation. Good riddens.

I think the scummiest part, though, was when a family started to show signs of financial struggle (downsizing their house, moving to a less nice area), full grown adults would spread that juicy gossip like an airborne disease.

About 4 years ago my friend got me a pair of [these Shure earphones](http://media.guitarcenter.com/is/image/MMGS7/SE215-Dynamic-Microdriver-Earphones-Clear/H72276000001000-00-500x500.jpg) for Christmas. They were pretty good earphones, not the best, but they pretty good sound quality and decent noise cancellation. 

In October of last year we took a bus up to Minnesota to visit a friend for a few days. We chose the late bus so we could just sleep during the 8 hours it would take us to get there. We're getting settled and I see him pull out his earphones, which were the same as mine, and put them on [like this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--pKPRT7pdPg/Tcir5pRCHaI/AAAAAAAAABM/AG-t-WUcEVM/s1600/hj_SE215CL%2528right%2529.jpg) over the ear. I never wore them like that. I just kind of jammed them in a way they fit. I asked him about wearing them like that and he said, ""What do you mean? That's how you're supposed to wear them. How do you wear them?"" I showed him how I typically wore them [(which is like the second image here)](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDHVTUi38J8/maxresdefault.jpg) and he laughed and said, ""Wearing them the right way gets a better seal for the sound."" 

I still wore them my way, until he fell asleep and then I decided to give his way a chance. HOLY SHIT it made such a huge difference. The sound was better, they felt more comfortable, and they were so much better at cancelling out noise. When we got to the first stop I told him, ""Why the hell didn't you tell me I was wearing them wrong for so many years?! This is so much better!"" He told me I should have read the manual, but in my defense I didn't think I had to read the manual for a pair of ear buds. 

Ever since then I have such an appreciation for owning decent headphones and wearing them correctly."

Yes, it does make me feel uncomfortable. I'm not interested in strangers' opinions of my appearance, and I'm especially not interested in men who think that opinion entitles them to my attention. 

One time recently I was walking along the street and a guy walking in the opposite direction stepped right in front, stopped me, told me I was beautiful and asked if he could give me his number. He didn't say it in a creepy or threatening way, didn't get aggro when I turned him down, but the point is this: it's a work day, I'm obviously busy, have somewhere to be, I'm on my own train of thought, which I've now lost, thank you very much - and you want to get all up in my face like I've got no other reason to exist in public except for you to go window shopping? Just, no. 

Context counts for a lot, though. The exact same interaction in a bar on a Friday night would have been fine. 

Another time a guy stopped me while I was riding along a popular walking/cycle trail. He was on foot, frowning at his phone and looked like he needed help. Asked for directions to a place, then didn't listen at all when I gave them, shifted his demeanour from 'confused' to 'I'm sexy (wink)' and proceeded to hit on me. Nobody has time for that shit. "

We were instructed to invent some dialogue and further illustrate, and create a story. It was a pretty bullshit assignment designed to waste time towards the end of the semester, and I didn’t want to do it, but the sub said it would be a participation grade. So I drew a Schutzstaffel mouse preparing to burn a Jewish cat in the fireplace. Was it in poor taste? Absolutely. Was it pretty funny? To the other middle schoolers, yes. Not so much to our older substitute, who took it pretty seriously. She called the office and was very upset, and concerned I might be dangerous.

When people are really good at drawing they draw shapes and not the expectation of what a face would look like. Real good life drawing skills come from observation of shapes, which your friend obviously didn't have skills in yet, like many people.

[Chuck Close](http://legionofhonor.famsf.org/blog/invisible-man-self-portrait-chuck-close) is a photorealistic portrait artist who has prosopagnosia and he can draw faces, because he's really good at these observation skills and applies them well while drawing.

Most people (basically, nearly all) draw 'assumptions' of what a face is. They see an eye and instead of actually drawing the shape, they draw what they expect. (In art school you can sometimes notice drawn characters always looking a little like the artist as well, it's funny) Your friend didn't draw his observation of shapes, he drew his 'assumptions' of what a face is, which shows us how he interprets it."

The fun fact is that, because of their bizarre anatomy, female hyenas have to give birth *through* this thing, which results in the cub bursting out of it in a gory mess like that alien chestburster, only out the side of a dick. A dickburster, if you will. And not the sexy kind. 

This also results in a very dangerous first pregnancy for young females as risk of death occurs with any wound in the wild, and a 1/4 death rate among cubs, who often suffocate. "

I knew something was strange when they hired me. I had zero banking experience and didn't have a business or Econ degree. 

When they kept telling me to alter loan and credit card applications to people who couldn't afford it, I knew I had to leave. 

I walked up to the branch manager and told him he was a thief. He stared at me with a puzzled look and said, ""I believe we're helping these folks secure a better financial future"" I never laughed louder in my existence. 

I quit that day, and 6 months later every branch and district manager were quietly fired before one of the many scandals broke.

Everyone she spoke to (when she actually reached someone, which was infrequent) confirmed that she owed us $300.

On what was to be my last day, I pulled up at 8:00 (when we opened) and nobody with a key was there. We had to wait until 8:30 for one of the owners to stop by and let us in.

The patient had been circling the building and, when we finally opened, she was the first patient to enter. 

I brought up her account.
This poor lady owed us $350.
Nobody had bothered to mention this to her, despite her repeatedly calling us.
One of the nurses was just saying ""take the $300"", but the owner was saying ""she owes us $350"" but wouldn't explain why, to me or to her. He was fiddling with the printer, right behind me, the whole time.

5540,"LA riots. I was living in Hollywood, in an apartment complex with a bunch of wannabe musicians and actors. A bunch of us headed up to the roof, drank beers, played music, watched the smoke plumes rising all over the city. 

Then we saw some people pushing giant TV's and such down our street below - the Circuit City on the corner was getting looted. We all went down to watch. It was pretty surreal, people running in and out with things. Once a cop car pulled up to the front door and parked for a few minutes talking on his radio, then he left and the looting continued. A drug store on the other corner was busted open, and random suburban-looking white people were driving up and filling their cars with diapers and bottled water and things. Bizarre. 

I walked down Hollywood Blvd the day after, most places were closed, not many people on the street. The stores owned by Korean merchants were obvious - owners were still on the roofs with rifles. We waved and smiled."

During TFA the film makes it seem like The First Order is remnants of the Empire trying to claw back territory while the New Republic has control over much of the former Empire/Old Republic, and sets up an exciting, galaxy wide conflict that the viewer is excited to see play out over the next few movies (the scope of which was similar to the prequels, which was one of the best thing about the prequels).

By the end of the TLJ there's like 30 people left in ""The Resistance"".

What is the fucking ""resistance"".  Wasn't Leia, Poe, Ackbar, etc. all just part of the New Republic military and political structure in the last film?

Did the First Order conquer *the entire fucking galaxy* in between the films?  We know they only got to use their superweapon once before it was destroyed, and that it destroyed the New Republic Capital System of Hosnia.  That is just one planetary system. we know from the previous films (especially the prequels) that there are *thousands* of inhabited worlds and systems, many of which are home to billions of people.  Did they all just give up after Starkiller Base was used, even though it was destroyed right after?  Did the New Order have some other superweapon or a giant fleet hidden somewhere else that it used to conquer the Galaxy?

Rian Johnson took an exciting revitalization of the Star Wars universe and took a huge, steaming shit all over it.  Now instead of a far reaching space opera we have like 20 kids who have to stand up to apparently the only army left in the universe.

Not at all. She's been kidnapped by her psycho stalker who violently rapes her to the point that she miscarries. She's in fear for her life.

I regularly worked this much, and my manager at the time regularly put in 80-90 a week (and had apparently been doing it for years)  
There is way more than enough overtime there to add at least one more full time person to the staff, but upper management wouldn't do it.  
They told us that our workload wasn't that bad, (aka we weren't that far behind) so we didn't need another person.  
they completely ignored the fact that it took insane overtime every week to make that happen.  
It would have been infinitely more cost effective for them to hire a different person too, but they didn't care.  
Moved over to IT, which was regular hours (45/week), and was enough of a pay raise that I pretty much broke even after losing all of the overtime.  
IT culture has its issues too, but I would never go back.

5673,"I am that one awful roommate who stole somebody’s pet. 


I got a kitten, roommate wanted a kitten but couldn’t afford the $100 to get one. That should’ve been the first red flag but whatever. I got her a kitten for her birthday. 

She then proceeded to lose interest and not give him attention or take care of him. When the kittens got ear mites, I paid the $300 to clear them up. I paid for her cat’s food, water, litter, licensing, vaccinations, neutering, and microchip. As a result of all that, everything was in my name.  I made sure the babies always had food and water and clean litter. I trimmed their nails. I bought the toys, the cat tree, etc.

Well my roommate was from out of state and took the kitten home with her over winter break. She didn’t stay on top of the cats nails. He’s polydactyl and two of his toes are half formed—they grow between his thumb and the first toe, but they are just claws and not a full toe. Anyway, if you don’t stay on top of trimming them they will grow into his paw pads. And so I then paid the vet bill to treat his ingrown/impacted nails. Also when she came back this once sweet cat was straight up mean. I’m not sure how he was mistreated, but I’m pretty sure he was. 


When the lease was up, I was moving in with my boyfriend. I moved my clothes and cat first, and had been gone for about a week before coming back for the big stuff and to clean. 

Her cat had been without food and water for at least four days. The litter box was filthy. Just completely neglected while I had been gone. 

So in that first load that had my bed, tv, Xbox, other expensive stuff, we stole the cat. Took him in the cat carrier (pretty much the only thing related to him she bought) and took him to my new place to be with his kitty sister. This happened first thing in the morning, maybe 8am. 

At 4pm, I get a text from her asking if i took her cat carrier. It was another hour before she even realized the cat was gone. 

She came unglued on me and assaulted my boyfriend and I when we came back for the last load. But I can’t say I feel bad about stealing that sweet kitty. 

This was all almost two years ago and the little orange dude is back to his sweet self. He’s my bud and he loves to lay on me and make bread. He’s also best friends with our one year old lab. 

TL;DR: I’m the evil ex roommate who stole my friend’s cat.

The market is far too saturated and everyone competes on razor thin margins. All the money made in this business is predatory practises (long, high interest loans with “low biweekly payments” and ripping off customer trade in cars and reselling/auction for a quick buck.)

Our society throws away working cars for the dumbest reasons. Buy a 10yr old decent car and drive that sucker into the ground. Who gives a shit what other people think you need to look out for #1. You have no need to deal with these jokers at a dealer unless you’re comfortable with taking a loss."

5716,"So my parents and I were working on redoing some parts of the kitchen. The whole room was gutted but my father is a plumber and my mother isn't too shy when work needs to be done. Unless it's heavy, then suddenly I get the nickname ""Muscles"" which is surprisingly kinda true these days because of work. Anyway, I was just watching them working, and something in my heart was just born. It's something I need to do. It's who I want to be. It's simple.

 A couple days down the road, my sister gets home from work. I'm grinning like a kid who just won a crane game. I stealthily take the old minivan, which we share, out while my parents are doing something and my sister is on the couch. I go to our moderately local QuikChek and order my parents and I all chocolate milkshakes while I look for something for my sister. She didn't really help much with the kitchen project, but I love her and I want her to be included. She's also vegan, so milkshakes weren't an option. I walk around the store looking for some kinda drink she'd like but most of it just stuff she isn't into much. And then I see it, a couple of familiar looking bottles. Kombucha! Now for those of you who don't know what it is, I don't blame you, I don't really know much either other than it's some fermented probiotic drink.

 Anyways, this was great because now I had something to get her, so I grabbed one of the two flavors and paid for my shakes and drink, since they do a prepay thing. Then I went to get my shakes. At this point I'm smiling so hard it looks like I won a lottery or something. I noticed that the lady making my milkshakes didn't put any whip cream on them, and then I remembered why. They have these computers where you customize your orders, and I forgot to put whip cream on it. I was a bit nervous to say something, but the little remnants of social anxiety left after years of personal growth were finished off by my heart's desire to get my family some really good milkshakes. I ask the woman if she minds adding whip cream, and she adds some. She was very nice too. I wish more people were that nice.

 I grab my milkshakes with their drizzle beneath the whip cream and that ginger kombucha and leave. I have a smile like the Joker's after he's just told a real knee-slapper. I get in the car, and arrive home. I get inside and my father is in his chair. I show him the goods, and his eyes light up, and so did my heart. Then he says something like ""I was wondering where the car went. One moment it was there, then I noticed it was gone, then a second later you pulled in."" Stealth actually worked. My sister curiously looks at what I got. I let my mother know and I put them on the kitchen table, which is now in the family room, for everyone to enjoy. They're all elated and surprised. They're so appreciative. My sister is really happy that I found some kombucha. I wasn't totally sure about the ginger but she said she liked them all and was really glad I got her some. Everyone was gleaming with joy. I felt so fulfilled, like a  mountain climber who reached the peak of Everest. The milkshake was very good on it's own. I liked it a lot. I loved giving to my family more. I only stopped smiling a few hours later because my face hurt. I was still smiling on the inside though. I finally found my passion.

All of that, for about $10."
5717,"I wake up every morning with my body feeling like it's full of bricks. It's just heavy. My head usually hurts, my stomach almost always hurts. My brain is usually pretty scattered and takes a few hours to really get it together, no matter what time I wake up. I usually have anxiety on my way to work, I get shortness of breath and shakey. Sometimes songs or random thoughts can trigger sad feelings for no reason. I can't just walk past a coworker I have to think about what I'm going to say to them, where I am looking, when I will say hi, how I will end it. I'm am constantly analyzing all my actions out of worry. I am always tired and I always feel like I'm dragging myself around. I've gotten out of the mindset of wanting to die all the time but there is a part of me that just always feels empty and sad. I have a hard time believing my family truly loves me and I constantly replay things in my past that have happened that have hurt me. I don't have friends anymore, I have my boyfriend but I haven't had a real friend in almost 3 years. When I'm alone, I am truly alone. Sometimes I just feel like this sad pathetic person trying to be happy and make something of my life but there will always be this sadness just weighing me down. When I'm not with my boyfriend I just feel like a waste of space really, like I'm this sad person trying to be likable and I'm just not. "

My husband kept telling me he wanted to remodel the basement.  I told him  ""sure"", thinking that we'd get serious about it sometime soon, but obviously we need a plan, budget, etc. 

Shortly after, on a cold February night, we're sitting on the  basement couch drinking wine when my husband says ""Hey, can you help me load up the truck?"" I'm like, ""Huh, what are we loading?"" He says, ""The couch. I'm going to take it to the dump tomorrow!"".

I was so confused. I'm like ""The couch we're sitting on now?"" He says ""yeah. we're going to remodel the basement, right?""

Coincidentally, he ended up sleeping on the couch that night. It turned into a pretty big fight and I was \*seriously\* freaked out over how impulsive he was willing to act over something that is so time consuming and expensive. I'm a serious planner and I'm very strategic. For about 2 weeks, I was horrified. Now I realize that we balance each other out in this regard! "

5746,"I suspected my boyfriend was from a wealthy family but when he told me what family he was from (he asked me not to tell so of course I told my best friend but I ain’t telling y’all) I freaked out a little. He acts like a normal guy, minus the fact he’s very flippant about how much money things cost; I had asked if he wanted to go with me to visit my friend in New York and he said sure, so when I mentioned my friend said our hotel has to have a bathtub (her apartment is so small she doesn’t have one) and he goes “well we’d be staying at the Waldorf. They obviously have bathtubs”. I said I couldn’t afford the Waldorf and he goes “it’s only $1,000 a night. Plus you won’t be paying.” He’s also offered to help me pay off my debt (about $50k total), offered to take me to Bora Bora for my birthday when I jokingly asked if we could, bought me $255 Versace sunglasses because “they made me think of you”, is planning to take me to a wedding in Monaco where I would pay for nothing, and told me if I passed the FSOT on the first try he’d give me a million dollars. 

On the flip side, on our first date he asked if I was okay with him paying for dinner, and offered to Rock Paper Scissors me for it. He lost so he paid, but we generally decide who pays that way. 

It’s nice knowing if I ask for something small (or big) I’ll get it, since with my ex I had to pay for everything, even my own prom corsage, but it also freaks me out that he has that much money. Idk. This’ll get buried but I wanted to share my POV

I was at work function, and couldn't get away to the bathroom. I tried everything I could to try to get it to go away, but it just stayed there, and would occasionally flare up to remind me.

It took me two hours, but I finally got to a bathroom and got a wad a toilet paper on the end of my finger and started going to town.

5802,"I’ve posted about this before. 

In 8th grade I went on vacation with a group of 5 girls to one of their parents cabins one summer. One night all of us were sitting in a circle in a bed and somehow the topic of queefing came up. I was 12 and barely knew what a queef was let alone heard one. 

One of the girls says she can do it on command and shows everyone. Before I know it, I am sitting in a circle with 5 girls laying on their backs, legs up, all simultaneously queefing.

The worst part about it all (and it's still ongoing because I'm fighting to save it as best I can) is that all of the daily running of the house and child-care is now my responsibility while she goes out to the gym, or football practise, or to an unspecified friend's house to watch a film late at night. Suspicious but I have no real proof that this isn't actually true.

5812,"Way to reinforce the stigma that men can't be imagined as serious wedding planners. Obviously, men can only plan bro weddings. That'll totally help.

Edit to put my expanded point higher: Simply put, this is a thread asking guys what they don't do because of social anxiety, he shares, and the response to him applies social norms to his desire.

I used to watch Project Runway and found the process of design fascinating. When I shared that I wished it was more acceptable for straight men to be fashion designers, I got a response exactly like this. ""Oh yeah, like designing haute couture cargo pants!"" It was obviously meant as a joke, but guess what functions as a great dismissal? No, I want to make fashion lines for both men and women, gorgeous dresses, flashy suits. Is that so hard to believe, just because I'm straight?

Even if OP was the most bro dude around, wedding planners don't pick decor and theme. Wedding planners take what the couple wants and creates the best version of that they can. Assuming he would do that job differently because he is a man is quite literally why we have this thread.

Well she eventually found out that her two sons six years old and seven years old would stand in the bathroom tub and pee from the tub into the toilet and of course pee got everywhere. Once she found this out the punishment for the two boys was they having to sit down every time they had to pee. She would occasionally follow them to the bathroom and listen and if she heard what sounded like people standing she would add another month on to the punishment.

She was one of 4 women working for a 10 person architecture firm that was struggling. Everyone was called in for an early meeting before work, and when they all showed up, there were a ton of cakes and coffee and donuts. Their boss instructed them not to touch any of it, and that he needed to have some brief one-on-one meetings first. He calls in one woman. Five minutes later, she comes out with a look of disbelief, clears her desk, and says she was fired and goes home. A second woman gets called in. Same thing, goes home. The third woman gets called in, same thing, goes home. Then the same thing happened to my coworker. Now, the whole firing all the women thing isn't necessarily a Michael Scott thing, but the fact that the boss of a struggling company bought a massive spread, laid it all out and told nobody to touch anything yet, then immediately fired 4 employees feels tone-deaf in a very Michael Scott way."

5863,"I had a similar problem. My family members are some of the most racist people I've ever known. I grew up hating black people. I realized it was stupid fairly quickly, even by 5th grade. Unfortunately, and I imagine this is more common than you might expect, it's not as simple as making a desicion. I mean, the way you treat others certainly is, and it's not hard one. What is hard is changing your feelings. Growing up in a racist family really is like being indoctronationm. Hell, maybe it IS indoctrination. I grew up thinking that all black people were smelly evil criminals that would as soon stab you or steal your wallet as talk to you. It really was that bad. Those feelings don't go away. They fade a bit. But they're always there, and they make me feel awful. I get nervous when I have to talk to a black person (though the feeling goes away quickly after getting to know them). I, as a large 6' tall man,  get genuinly scared of passing a black person on the street at night. They're not as bad as they used to be. If I were to tell anyone so knew irl, they would be shocked that I feel this way because I treat everyone kindly. So many people think that thought can be changed with logic. Rather, logic introduced to rational thought just produces congnstive dissonance in me. It doesn't make the bad feelings go away. "

5865,"It can be really hard to explain as there's so much to do with social anxiety that can get lost in simple words - however my experience with it is feeling extremely uncomfortable in any conversation, which can translate into both awkward and seemingly unfriendly behaviour.    
Your brain doesn't work the same way as it does when you're relaxed - I know that my thinking goes out of whack when anxiety comes into the picture, and contribute to making weird/stupid/crazy choices which you later look back on and wonder why the hell you did that.  
On very rare occasions when the stars have aligned, I've had amazing conversations that had flow and a natural, enjoyable feel to them.  
With social anxiety, that flow isn't there. Every choice you make is a 'manual' choice - maybe forced is a better word but it's not something I can always control, and trying to control it only makes it worse.  
With all of this, people tend to notice your behavior and react badly to it, which further reinforces and increases the anxiety.  
 
Simply put, it makes *everything* harder. Imagine reaching for your drink and taking a sip. Easy, right? Nope! If you're feeling some anxiety at that moment, it's near impossible to do it comfortably or in a natural, relaxed way.  
Some nights I try to relax myself but I get distracted within 10 seconds, soon finding myself tense again.  
And the dating world? That's hard for most people. Try having social anxiety thrown into that and see how much it throws things off.  
  
To end this description, the most frustrating thing is that you might know who you are and what you are capable of in your natural mindset. Anxiety is like locking that in a dark, cold room where you only have space to stand. The oxygen isn't quite enough in there, and you can't quite get warm enough. The pressure of the air is oppressive, and the smell of it is more stale than you would expect.  
Outside of that room is where everyone else is, and they can't quite hear you. You can't quite communicate what you want to say to them.  
And getting frustrated at it only makes it worse."

Apparently, one of their bartenders was caught roofing girls’ drinks for his friends and arrested. Now all the campus bars on 13th street in Eugene, Oregon require student IDs, and most keep their lights on throughout the night. 

It disgusts me that the school I loved so much has such a intensive rape culture. So much so that the bars in the area can’t even function like a normal bar (lights on on the dance floor, only certain people allowed in). Furthermore, the rape accusations that are consistently occurring against the Oregon athletes which the school sweeps under the table and continually allowing the accused athletes to wear their uniforms, play, and represent the school...

5927,"It was a gothic wedding for someone I worked with. I knew she was a bit goth but I didn't know that was the theme of the wedding. So I turned up in a suit and looked like a weirdo because half of those present looked like something from lord of the rings (except with more black), the other half looked like Edward Scissorhands cosplay doing a walk of shame after servicing the roadies from a Billy Idol concert.

There was only one person there I knew, also a work colleague. We weren't especially close and wouldn't usually speak outside of work.He kept talking about work all night, even after I asked him to stop, but ultimately there was not much we had in common so at least it filled the silence. 

I had to drive so couldn't drink and the ""cousins metal band"" were as bad as first impression indicated and blew the power out for a good half an hour. 

Everyone else seemed to enjoy themselves and the black icing on the wedding cake made my shit turn green so maybe it wasn't a total loss."

5932,"After 2 negative festival experiences I have no desire to visit another music festival anytime soon

Snowglobe 2013: multi day festival in Lake Tahoe. Great lineup but much of the crowd was made up of incredibly intoxicated people. Being on MDMA myself I'm already beginning to get some self conscious feelings regarding my use. As the night progressed this feeling got stronger and stronger. One 2 separate occasions that night I saw different girls collapse onto the ground and be rushed off by emts. Rolling so hard at the time, the screams of their friends and the panic in the air have been vividly imprinted in my brain

Hard summer 2014: An amazing festival until the end. The first day my friend and I met a friendly guy in the crowd rolling incredibly hard. He asked if we liked cocaine since we were dancing so goddamn hard. Of course we say yes and he gives us at least 3gs of pretty high quality coca (had a test kit, unsure of purity though). The second day was another strong roll, dancing my ass off with friends to Nero and Flux Pavillion. Myself and friends were leaving the final act of the night and were nearly run down by a golf cart with 2 emts. They parked 15 yards away from us and proceeded to load a girl with an oxygen mask on her face into the cart. I clearly saw this girl getting loaded and taken away hoping she was ok. Read the news the following morning, she had died from impure ""molly"" and dehydration.

After those experiences I can't control the anxiety surrounding the feeling of getting high with 20000 other people."

5944,"A couple of years ago, I'm pretty sure my dad and I saw something we can't really explain.. I can't say for certain but it's definitely the occurrence in our lives that we don't talk about and still makes me asks questions that I don't think I'll ever get answers for. 

I am used to quiet towns that close down well before the sun sets. I grew up in one and it's pretty rare to see anyone that lives in them out past 8:30. I just assumed that's what occurs elsewhere. One summer, my dad, my sister and I  decided to take a road trip down to Arkansas. Except my dad had to stay late at work, which resulted in us leaving pretty late to start out 5 hour road trip. I'm gonna say it was 2:30 in the morning and we were on a deserted two lane highway in Missouri. My dad hates anything to do with driving in traffic, so he usually prefers to take older highways with less cars on them. 90% of the time they're easier to speed on too, as cops don't frequent them as much.

My little sister was passed out in the back seat, as we were definitely nearing 90 on a road that we hadn't even seen a car on for almost an hour at this point. I probably could've been sleeping as well, but I like to stay awake to make sure my father doesn't start to drift off. He had just gotten off a 10 hour shift after all. I look up from my phone for a split second and see a black outline of a person in the road and before I can realize what was happening,  my dad was veering off the road into the ditch. I could've sworn we had hit this person, in the middle of nowhere, from the fact my grown ass father was hyperventilating.

""I didn't even see him there.. seriously, what the fuck?"" 

I just sat there dazed, confused and fucking terrified. I didn't know if I should've called 911 or if we had to stay in the car or if we had to go out and check on this person. It is Missouri, after all. My dad gets out of the car and I'm clutching my phone just waiting for him to tell me what to do. Except he never does. He just gets back in and keeps driving. My little sister had slept through the whole thing, somehow. I kept trying to ask him what was there and he wouldn't even answer me.

I had literally felt the impact of this person on our truck. I can't even fathom how my dad wasn't pissed that the front end had been smashed or why he hadn't called the police.  I spent that whole trip with a pit in my stomach, thinking my father had killed someone in butt fuck Missouri and nobody would ever know. Of course my sister had questions about the damage to the car, but she was quickly preoccupied with the activities of the trip. The ride back, my dad took the main interstate all the way.

It took him nearly a month to tell me what happened. He still hasn't told my mom or his siblings either. He told me that when he got out of the car, there wasn't anything, not a trace of anyone or anything that could've hit the car. Not even a drop of blood. He told me that he's never questioned his own sanity or otherworldly things before until that exact moment. 

I still don't know what to think. The physical damage on our car says otherwise, but the lack of something that couldve produced the damage sends me on a tail spin sometimes. 

Tl;dr: we ran into something in Missouri, except something was nothing"

I was 13 and went on a weekend Christian youth camp with my best friend. Up until then, this youth group was a fun mix of religious message hidden in activities and song. I thought it was just a social thing and I loved it. 

We drove in buses for a couple of hours and stayed on some property in cabins. The “youth” kids were all 12-17 years old and our “leaders” were five people aged 35-60. That weekend, on the Friday night, we had a special presenter from Hillsong come and lecture to us. He was very charismatic and he spoke as though every message was spoken directly to “you”. 

He was telling us about the Holy Spirit, that the Holy Spirit could tell that we were all failures and destined for hell. We had sinned by being bad students, bad children, stupid, lustful, jealous... basically just by being human. I thought he was a lunatic, but I watched as he gradually worked the entire room into an absolute frenzy. People lost it. Kids were hyperventilating, crying, passing out everywhere. Lots of them were screaming. One kid collapsed on the floor and started raking his nails down his cheeks until they bled. The “leaders” watched all of this with stern faces and encouraged “punishment by the Holy Spirit”. My best friend hyperventilated, collapsed and had what I can only describe as a “fit” (though it wasn’t a true seizure and she never suffered from them). 

I was terrified - felt like I was the only one at the whole camp who wasn’t drinking the koolaid. Our phones were confiscated for the whole trip and I was relying on these loonies getting me home.

My best friend tried to commit suicide twice after that trip - felt she wasn’t good enough for god. I’m not a fan of organised religion now and I’m very wary of super religious people. I’ve seen how it can be used to control/ruin vulnerable people. 

TLDR: Crazy Christian youth camp, kids physically attacking themselves, adults acting like they deserved it. Suicidal kid as a result. 

Edit: Name and shame. Added that he was a Hillsong worker."

5992,"Had been seeing things in my room (once, for a few seconds, I saw a little girl lying down face up sliding away from me, another time woke up with a black-mist creature-thing with it's face about an inch from me), and I would get weird, paranoid vibes in there to the point where I would get up and leave the room. 

Thought it was just me going crazy or something, until one day my roommate (I lived with 5 friends) said he saw me looking at him have sex with a girl through a hole in the door between our rooms.  When they were through doing their thing, they confronted me about it, but in a funny, laughing it off way, but I had been in the living room for hours and we were the only ones home. When I went to my room, the lights were off and I saw that my roommate had put a sock in the door-hole. After his girl left, we talked about it more and both got kinda creeped out when he realized I was telling the truth. That's when I figured it wasn't just me, and I started to believe right there and then. I've had more experiences since, but none as intense/realistic as in that room."
5993,"All of my ""bad"" experiences from various things have always stemmed from three things:

1. No forethought on when I took them. If there is shit on my mind for any reason, you can bet they are going to seep out later. Sometimes being aware of it is enough defense, but only to a point.

2. Not having the forethought to ""breakout' of a bad thought pattern before it starts. There are clues I can pick up on if things are going south, and measures to counter them. All involving getting in a different setting, different activity, otherwise breaking it so I get grounded again.

3 . Not having the forethought to watch my dosage. Every bad experience starts with me being careless about this. I've only really fucked it up twice, and one of those times I was able to do an early breakout to minimize it. 

Anyway, the only real bad one was I when I get stuck in a thought loop that I was murdered that night. I was absolutely convinced i was murdered that night, and my universe was that I was to live out that day and that every night I was murdered after realizing too late. I had thought I had done this for 2 years now. I was stuck in that loop I think for an hour. Facing the same events....same day...over and over again.

The second time it happened, I did that panic for maybe 60 seconds. Then I thought ""if I'm going to die, let's die somewhere different"". Just going outside was enough to snap it .

Stay safe friends."

I had a weird mellow trip with a similar ""environment"".  Everyone talks about getting ripped out of reality into other dimensions, and here I was sitting on the floor, and the floor just kind of disappears and below me I'm gazing down into some sort of supermarket looking store.

Following the breakup, I naturally went to my friends for support, because not having her in my life means I'll have a void there. I try to get closer with my friend, but it seems like she's growing more distant. I learned recently that it's because she thought I was going to rebound onto her and didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested. But wait! It gets even more frustrating. The reason she thought I was rebounding onto her was partly due to me complimenting a haircut THAT SHE ASKED ME ABOUT. She sent me a snapchat saying ""notice anything different?"" to which I responded with something along the lines of ""nice haircut! looks really good"". If that's flirting, then everything is. "

6075,"When I was studying at the university, I tutored a sweet boy for a couple of years. He was a scrawny, little boy with a sharp wit. Kids in school loved to tease him, so he answered back with the right words that would hurt them, and they bullied him even more. So he thought that being edgy would make him appear more fearful, and he loved to write short horror stories full of blood and killing, and draw these scary drawings. He just wanted to feel bigger and safer, and maybe to attract some attention. His parents were worried. I just encouraged him to write more, telling him that, yes, that's a scary story, oh, that's a scary drawing, but he was really good at writing and drawing, that was his talent, he should do more. He usually showed this big, large smile, you could see how he felt finally understood. Not shunned by kids, not with adults worried for him, but understood. Someone liked what he did.

Turns out they needn't have worried. The engineer on our side was a well-endowed young woman.

So I would play videogames with him(he was terrible at them on drugs) and eat out with him at red robin. He loved their whiskey river burger, thats all he ever ordered. On this fateful day in our mid-20's, he orders the whiskey river bbq burger, takes a bite, looks kind of upset, takes a couple more rapid bites, starts shaking and turning red while producing rage tears, sets his burger down and spits his food out, looks at me and says ""I'm so fucked up right now I can't even taste my favorite fucking burger"" and starts bawling at the table.

6135,"Apparently it's been a problem for militaries all throughout history. I seem to recall that after the Napoleonic Wars, the Prussian military wanted to find out why they performed poorly during the first parts of the war, so they set out to do an accuracy study.

They would take a long piece of cloth and have a regiment fire on it as though it were an opposing block of soldiers. Their accuracy was about expected given the quality of firearms at that time, but when compared to actual casualty figured of the French armies who opposed the Prussians, it seemed way off. The French should've been losing significantly more men than they were.

It turns out that the soldiers would aim slightly above the enemy, either consciously or subconsciously, because of a strong urge to not want to actually kill anyone.

I'm just recounting this from the recesses of my mind, so I don't know if it is true or not, but I hope it is. It would show that humans aren't the savages we think we are.

There's a reason the military trains with human-shaped targets now. It's to condition you mentally for actually shooting other people."

MRS. CLAUS STEPS IN  
Leading a rag-tag team of angry elves who have been subjugated for too long by Bernard's powerful tribe, Mrs. Claus launches a full-on assault against the Workshop, the front out of which Bernard operates. But Bernard's elves are bigger, stronger, and more magically skilled. Plus, they knew it was coming when Parsley failed to report back that Mrs. Claus' daily sedative had been administered. The battle is ferocious, and Mrs. Claus ends up using a surprisingly large amount of Christmas magic against the evil elf, but he escapes unharmed. Outnumbered and outgunned, with the Workshop turning out to be a reinforced fortress in disguise, Mrs. Claus is forced to retreat.

Worse, she can feel the Christmas magic growing weaker, in ways it never has before. And she realizes her beloved Nic is using more of it than he ever has. He is trying to change the world in one endless night.

---
THE ELVEN EMPIRE STRIKES BACK  
Now fully aware that something has gone terribly wrong, Bernard prepares to launch an all-out assault. They've detected Santa back in Detroit at long last, and if they can destroy him, they can undo all of his work. ""Tonight isn't a catastrophe,"" Bernard intones. ""It is an opportunity. He's over-extended himself, and is weak now. We can finally end this farce, and destroy Santa Claus! Prepare the soldiers, the gingerbread men, the sugarplum bombs! Christmas dies TONIGHT!""

---
A SLAYING SONG TONIGHT  
In Detroit once again, Santa feels the Christmas magic fading. He weakens and falls, with only DJ there to hold him up. Time begins to move again. Throughout the world, in mere moments everyone - and I do mean *everyone* - will wake to their fondest Christmas wishes at last coming true. ""Have I done it?"" Nic gasps from his knees in the snow. ""Have I done enough?""

""Man, you done more than anyone,"" says DJ, still in tears over the gift Santa gave his own mom: A paid-off mortgage.

Santa takes in a breath and starts ho-ho-ho-ing, but he's hardly uttered the second ""ho"" when a sugarplum bomb strikes nearby, blasting him back.

""Couldn't leave well enough alone, could you, old man!"" screams Bernard from above, in one of the prototype high-speed sleighs. As Santa watches, another sleigh appears, then another, and another. The sky is full of them.

---
GOODBYE, NORTH POLE  
Earlier, we see an excessively complicated scheme to smuggle Mrs. Claus onto one of the sleighs. She and Santa's Christmas magic combined might still be enough to stop the evil elves, but she has to be with him to do it.

She ends up strapped to the bottom, hidden with the peppermint missiles and gumdrop grenades. The sleigh ride is terrifying, and it's the first time in almost 2,000 years that Mrs. Claus has left the North Pole. But when she leaves the North Pole and its artificial illusion of continuous Christmas cheer, she sees the surrounding environs as they really are for the first time. The elves that do not run the Workshop live in squalor and servitude to match that of the rest of humanity. Only the secret few, those at the top of the vast conspiracy, live good lives. Flashback to earlier moments, when she'd observed how elves of other tribes are so quiet and servile. They're not happy workers, they're **slaves**.

---
SHOWDOWN  
Summoning his waning power, Santa stands to his full height, pushing DJ behind him. The snow swirls around him as bombs fall, unable to touch him. A moment of horror: The reindeer, still hypnotized, succumb to an order from Bernard to attack. All do, except Rudolph, the newest, the youngest, the least affected. Rudolph turns against his bigger, stronger brethren, and they trample him to death.

""No!"" Santa cries. ""Not Rudolph!"" But the reindeer won't listen and rush towards him. Cue major fight scene as Santa fights off his own reindeer, becoming more and more injured in the process. He refuses to kill them, and that looks like it might be his own undoing, when...

---
LIKE AN ANGEL  
Mrs. Claus descends from the sky in a ball of Christmas light, an ornament of sublime beauty. Elves and reindeer, Santa and the slowly waking populace of the slum... All are stunned by the beauty of her descent. She lands beside Nic, and takes his weakened, bloody hands in hers. Christmas magic infuses them both, and he struggles to his feet. Then he turns on Bernard, fists clenched.

""Now, Dasher,"" he intones, and takes a step forward. Dasher shakes his head, confused for a moment, as the cloud in his brain clears.

""No,"" Bernard says with a scowl. He takes aim with a lollipop launcher, and blasts Father Christmas in the chest. Santa falters, then continues.

""Now, Dancer."" He takes another step, and a second reindeer falls back, freed from slavery.

""Stop!"" Bernard screams. ""Take him out! Throw everything you've got at the Clauses!""

Explosions, earth-shaking booms, but another voice comes from the rubble. ""Now, Prancer and Vixen!"" It's DJ, eyes wild. He has seen sights he cannot unsee, and he *believes*. He helps keep Santa and Mrs. Claus on their feet.

Bernard drops his weapons, and runs forward. He'll take care of this *personally*.

What follows is an epic, choreographed fight, the ultimate battle for Christmas, and neither pull punches. ""I'll kill you!"" he screams, and the rest of the elves, their weapons rendered ineffective by Mrs. Claus' timely arrival, descend upon them, a ravening hoard.

---
REINDEER GAMES  
A change of perspective: Now we see the action from Dasher's, Dancer's, Prancer's and Vixen's perspective, as they turn on the still-hypnotized reindeer. They start to brawl, when a third voice cries out.

It's Mrs. Claus, calling out from the fray. ""On, Comet! On, Cupid!"" And two more reindeer are freed.

Then all three voices, Santa, DJ, and Mrs. Claus, roar out. ""Donner and Blitzen!""

(Bernard: ""Stop it!"")

""To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!""

(Bernard: ""STOP SAYING THAT!"")

""Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"" The reindeer move as one, alighting to the top of a high wall, and dive-bomb the elves. Tinsel and blood fly everywhere.

---
FINAL FIGHT  
Now at last, it's down to Bernard and Santa. Cue ultimate fight scene. Do this one with practical effects: The audience should feel every impact, and Bernard fights dirty. All is still except for these two final combatants.

Bernard, inevitably, gets the upper hand against the weakened Santa. He drags him to a rooftop, and forces him to look out at the devastation. Bodies all over the street, several reindeer dead. Mrs. Claus and DJ unmoving below. ""You see this? You see all this, old man? You caused this. You.""

Down below, DJ stirs and looks up. ""I believe in you, Santa,"" he murmurs. ""I believe.""

Santa looks up into Bernard's hate-filled face. ""You've hidden all this from me. For centuries. You belong... on the naughty list!""

With one last burst of energy provided by DJ, Santa bursts free, and in the ensuing struggle, Bernard is left dangling.

""You know, Bernard, in all these centuries, I have never once granted myself a wish."" He reaches for his bag, soiled and bloody, yet still, somehow, resplendent. He'd held tight to it as Bernard dragged him up. ""Tonight, at long last, I will."" And he pulls out a candycane gun. ""Merry Christmas to all,"" he intones as he takes aim. ""And to all a good-night!""

And with that, Bernard plunges to the very bottom of the naughty list.

6180,"Similar title, but Rules by Cynthia Lord. It's about a protagonist with an autistic younger brother, and the author does well to convey the struggles that she has to go through because of her brother and how ashamed she feels, and of course how other people react/treat him. It's not to say he can't function, but he's still very young (I think six or younger?), and as a result doesn't have a clear understanding of the world yet, and will still do things like place his toys in the fish tank. And of course, there are the rules he has to follow, which he occasionally forgets, but he does sometimes apologize if he feels he's been troublesome. Overall, the novel shows that having a developmental condition can make life difficult, but not impossible to go through. The main character herself learns that if kids her age are going to tease her brother not knowing or caring about why he is the way he is, they probably weren't going to be good friends, as shown with her consistent alienation from the group.

I liked TFiOS, but the scene where the main characters are applauded for making out in Anne Frank's attic was too much. 

I once heard somebody say that John Green is a writer who is really good at writing individual sentences but not good at writing books, and I think that's the best description of him I'd ever seen. He is really good at writing individual quotes that look good on a tote bag, but not good at writing memorable or believable plots. "

My ""most interesting"" case is actually one that just bothers me years later. In grad school I worked at a free clinic for homeless people. During my rotation there I started seeing this man who had recently gotten out of prison (13 years). He'd been convicted of drug crimes. Shortly after he'd being sent to prison his mother died and he was unable to attend her funeral. During the 13 years both his father and only sister also died. He reported extreme guilt over their deaths (particularly his mothers). Our early work was CBT-based and focused mainly on his guilt. His symptoms started to improve and he started going to church. Through the church he met a woman who allowed him to rent a room in her house. He got on food stamps and started cooking. He met a woman who he started dating. He found a job at a lumber yard and even did deliveries. He was doing much better. One day he gave me a business card from the lumber mill. He wrote his name on the back and told me that if I had any clients who were reliable, to give them the card and mention his name, that he'd get them a job there. He stopped coming to sessions a couple weeks later. Eventually I gave his card to a client who was doing well and looking for work. The next week that client came in and told me that he'd called, but that the company had never heard of the guy. I decided to google him and found nothing, not even his arrest or sentencing. To this day I have no idea if anything he told me was true."

A black guy who I had worked with for years, I fixed his computers for free, gave him a ride when his car had trouble, did it. I was doing the same job he was, but with extra work because I was much younger and full of spirit, he was also paid double what I was. He got his nephew hired as a temp and he was put on my team. After a few weeks it was clear this kid just wasn't kidding it and didn't have a work ethic of someone we needed. We built roof trusses and demands we're high and our quota was rising. I talked to management to get him swapped or I wouldn't make my quota and indeed my numbers were fixed that day and increased drastically. Afterwards his uncle approached me and said I did it cause he was black, to which I tried to defend myself and he just shook it off saying I always hated n words. I dropped my hammer and gloves on the spot and drove off that minute. An hour later the district manager called me and offered me 2 dollars more an hour for a total of 12 an hour if I came back, and I declined. I asked some guy whose computer I fixed before to get me a job and he hired me as a temp at general motors subsidy for 15 an hour. I started making more on 40hours than I was on 60 hours at the last job. My life improved drastically, I had so much more free time and eventually worked my way into general motors as a manager and in charge of the IT program.

Besides bringing prices down, this also removed DeBeers' reason for buying blood diamonds (which was that the warlords would release the diamonds on the open market unless DeBeers bought them, often at exorbitant prices). He's known as being weird for several issues. First, Israelis are an odd, incredibly impulsive culture as a starting point, and former-USSR Israelis have persecution complexes and neuroses on top of that. Next, he's a Lubavitcher, a sect that's well known because it's Chabad but is also on the fringe of normative Jewish beliefs. Lastly, he has a lot of weird business habits likely stemming from his background and the corruption common in the diamond industry, such as refusing to work with subcontractors or buy diamonds from anyone (which also means that he'll never touch blood diamonds, although he very well might have started hiring child laborers himself if he had thought he could get away with it).

There are also rumors he has Russian mob connections, but that's likely just prejudice against people of recent-European background."
6292,"Another one I’m a less-than-proud member of:

Centurion club. 


Everyone sits at a bunch of tables/benches. 

100 shots of beer, in 100 minutes.  No throwing up, no getting up for piss breaks, no missing the beep.  (Have a timer or stop watch, finish before chime ends)


Bonus:  every year we had the Legate’s challenge as well. 

As soon as Centurion ends, anyone who has previously achieved the rank can opt to stay seated.  (Still no breaks, and no ‘new’ centurions from the current year) to fight for the rank of legate. (General)

It then becomes a fight to last man standing (or sitting in this case)

1 shot of beer every minute until there is only one remaining. 


Why do this?  In our group, the Legate could demand a beer from anyone who sat in the centurion’s challenge and didn’t qualify as centurion that year. (A grunt). If you were previously a centurion, you were exempt from demotion if you didn’t make it in a subsequent year. 

1 beer per week.  With a large enough participation group (usually about 40-50 people) there’s generally about 15-25 who won’t make it. 

I won it in my 3rd year at uni, and it greatly reduced my beer expenditures when we were out.

He just kept talking to me and telling me to try and push a little further or hang in there.  I managed to get myself to a place that was a bit more stable and accessible due to his coaching and then he stayed there with me until more help arrived.  As I  understand it, they asked him if he could stay until I was out, since he had me calm and talking...he stayed.  As soon as I was accessible, they switched him out for a medic and a backboard and I couldn't turn my head to see anything from that point on- I also had so much dust in my eyes that it caused abrasions that messed with my vision for weeks.  I just wish I'd seen his face."

You have to do what’s right for both stories in the long run. And  so we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside. So the good thing is the only reason that line was in the first film was to just give you the feeling that these guys have known each other a long time and I think that college still does that.

This was almost four years ago, I was a couple months into my relationship with my SO, and it was Christmas Time. He was in the Navy and is not very close with his immediate family, so I invited him to spend a week with my family. It was winter break for me in my last semester of University. We had just started our sexual relationship about a week prior (I gave him my virginity and we boned a few times during that one weekend)... Anyway, he drives over and he meets my mom and brother for the week long visit. 


The second night, we all get smashed on a full handle of Fireball (to this day, it makes me want to die when I smell it). We go through the whole thing in about 90 minutes and I've had at least 10 shots, I'm guessing. I lost count. I'm sitting on my bf's lap as we're all loudly, drunkenly saying things to each other. He turns to my mother and shouts, ""your daughter has the cutest nipples I have EVER seen"".😳😳😳 I turn about 40 shades of red and shriek ""why would you say that?!"" And he just says, ""BUT IT'S TRUE!"" 


Later as I'm puking for the first time in front of him, I'm sadly moaning that ""he'll never find me attractive again"" seeing me like that and I randomly wave my hand defeatedly behind me as I say into the toilet ""no sex tonight, I don't want sex tonight.."" All in front of my mother who was in the bathroom with us to comfort me. Yeah, we were both a mess that night 🤦"

Two of the items were grocery items and a child’s book. Her son was with her and he was clearly sad they couldn’t get the book, and the mom kept apologizing to him. 

She paid and was leaving and I had the cashier ring up my two small items and then add the three items she left behind to mine. 

I caught up with her in the parking lot and told her she left a bag behind. She looked confused and then looked in it and then said she hadn’t paid for them. I told her not to worry about it and we exchanged looks, and I could tell she was a little embarrassed but grateful. I told her things were tough all over, what are neighbors for. She thanked me and said to her son, “Look, I left this behind and this nice man made sure you got it.”

I was suicidal and considering jumping that day.

I have struggled with depression since childhood, and the days before made the perfect storm in my brain. Being alive hurt too much, so I left work early and walked straight to \[famous bridge\]. I left letters to everyone in my email drafts and was ready to stop fighting. I found myself staring at the bridge for a long period of time. But it's a popular tourist spot, so I didn't feel like anyone was paying too much attention to me. I felt calm and mesmerized staring at the water.

I would say I look more striking in a ""different"" way than a traditionally pretty way. People have stopped me to take pictures with them before, so when this gentleman asked for some photos, I wasn't surprised. I also didn't care. There was nothing left in me to say no or care one way or the other.

So I let him take some photos of me by the bridge.

If someone has to open a new container for a dog food pallet, or they're doing two separate trips for two separate stores, then when they're using the pallet wrap machine, they generally hop off of their Center Rider.or PE and hand-wrap the second pallet which leads to this issue of tilting pallets and such.

6477,"&gt; Basically you have to take 3 hits before you’re allowed to fight back without penalty.

This is a great example of a rule written by someone who has never been in a real fight in their life, and only seen fighting in movies and boxing matches. A single good punch can end a fight in one go, and frequently does - especially if the assailant is bigger than the victim.

Kids should have a right - as a last resort - to defend themselves from physical violence. They shouldn't need to be assaulted BEFORE they defend themselves."

We then go to the department to find him and see what's going on. Can't find him. His co-worker in the department said she saw him walk away. So we page him. Doesn't answer. 

We finally find him in the hardware department alone staring at doorknobs. Ask him what he's doing and he just looks at me with the biggest unblinking eyes and says ""I'M JUST LEARNING EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT LOCKS"". He also reeked of weed.

He last 2 hours on his first shift on the sales floor. Found out after letting him go he had a huge drug problem and was apparently planning on stealing a bunch of stuff from the store. Dodged a bullet.

My first night closing by myself I was also tasked with training 3 new hires how to do everything and then train another employee how to count the cashbox. While I'm teaching how to count money to the first guy, two of the new hires managed to lock not one, but TWO keys to the bathroom inside the bathroom. We never got them out. While I was dealing with that, apparently the 3rd new hire did not shut the freezer properly... however I didnt discover this until the next day when all the ice cream in the fridge was half melted... and we still didnt have a way into the bathroom.

I called the manager several times and he would not answer.  My entire shift there was a line out of the door, so I was attempting to put soft ice cream in our ""deep freezers"" and thaw out ice cream that was rock hard from being in deep freeze. 

Still trying to call the manager about the ice cream and the bathroom. My new hires and making lots of little stupid mistakes all along the way. 

Someone else calls the manager he answers right away! I call him again and nothing so now I know he's purposely ignoring me and this situation. 

While we were closing, a bunch of roaches crawled across my foot and that was my last straw. I came into my shift the next day (knowing the manager was working) and took him I was done. We screamed at each other awhile and I leftm

In fact it seems as if he wrote his own book regarding their childhood. IMO there is nothing truly conclusive for either possibility. This type of abuse is atypical but it does happen and I'm of the opinion that even if the book is false (which I am not personally convinced of) it is at least an important issue of which to be aware and I don't see it as being as harmful a lie as others do.

6666,"This happened to a friend of mine about 20 years ago. He had been working as an installer of double glazed windows and would often find himself travelling with a crew all over Kent and the south east of the UK. One job he was doing wasn't all that far from home so they decided to drive home instead of staying over in  b&amp;b. 

They set off home quite late in the evening and it was already dark, there wasn't much on the roads, and it was pretty cold so not many pedestrians about.

They were going along one fairly straight bit of road when they passed through a fairly unremarkable village. It had the usual things like a pub and a corner shop, but little more else than cottages. 

About five minutes later a couple of his crew where complaining that they really needed a drink and there must be a pub around somewhere. He suggested that they turn around and go back to the village. They turn around, drive back and there was no village there. It was just fields. There wasn't any turn offs, so they couldn't have been mistaken. It was just one straight road."

After walking past several cars, I see Bob just finish up parallel-parking his car and get out.  He waves me down, gestures to the golden Volvo directly in front of him, and asks ""Is this your car? I bumped it when I was parking.""

I don't even know where to start with all that was wrong with that. *He saw me drive past him in a different car.*

(And fun fact, Bob and I have been taking the bus together for a year. This is also the same individual that walked up to the bus stop one day, saw me standing there, and asked me if the bus had come yet.)"

It all came to light because she finally felt safe enough, 1000 miles away from her father, to tell her school counselor what happened. IIRC, they ran genetic testing on the baby and confirmed it, which led to his arrest.

My aunt left him and was understandably fucked up after that. He went to prison.

Im a guy. When I was like 4 or 5, I was taking a shower by myself and really wanted to pee for some fucking reason. I have no idea why. I drank shower water and tried really hard to pee but I couldn't. So what do I think I should do to help me pee? Use liquid soap... not to drink... but to &gt;!take the nozzle, shove the tip of it into my urethra, and push the soap into my penis...!&lt;

I couldn't pee then and it hurt to try. Then my mom came into the bathroom and I started praying to God saying ""please let me pee and not hurt"" and she heard me and asked what i was saying and i said ""nothing..."" 

So i finish my shower and am on my bed and my mom walks in and I tell her about what happened and she rushes me to the shower, turns on the bathtub faucet at like full blast and tells me to put my penis under it and open my urethra. She had my dad on the phone (he was at home) and was explaining to him what happened and now I'm crying and i remember ask ""dad have you ever done anything like this!?!?"" And he said no.

I think the next day I could pee but that fucked up hard. Didnt put soap near my penis for *years*..."

Except for certain limitations such as the whole 'shouting fire in a theater' thing, or trying to motivate people to harm others. These limitations are very narrow, but are necessary for obvious reasons.

*But hatespeech is harmful!*. Yeah, yeah, I'm a Middle Eastern person in the EU, people can be racist, don't worry, you'll survive. I'll even defend racists' right to call me a sandnigger to my face, even though I might not appreciate the sentiment (I don't really care if they do though).

First they come for hatespeech, then they'll come for certain political speech, then they'll come for other stuff. Once you start eroding the most valuable freedom you have, you're doomed.

Not to mention, speech is how we communicate our thoughts. Often in order to understand our own thoughts, we need to say them out loud. How often have you come to a conclusion after saying something out loud, often mid-sentence?

Free speech is the basis of free thought, and once you're no longer free to think, you have no freedom at all."

6712,"Greetings, all:

I'm an organic chemist who specializes in naturally occurring vasodilatory substances. I can confirm that consumption of *mashed up* mosquitoes will increase erectile turgidity.

The mosquito, as with all blood-feeding arthropods, has mechanisms to effectively block the hemostasis system within their saliva, which contains a mixture of secreted proteins. Mosquito saliva acts to reduce vascular constriction, blood clotting, platelet aggregation, and angiogenesis.

It is universally agreed upon that human consumption of hematophagous arthropod saliva results in erectile benefit like no other naturally occurring vasodilatory substance.

The most cost efficient means of saliva harvest is, as the poster suggested, pulverization and consumption."

6721,"Nonsense, Iron Man was already easily one of the best-known Marvel superheroes. Had you taken a straw poll at any point between 1970 and 2008 Iron Man would have been the second or third most popular and recognizable Marvel character (after Spider-Man, who was undoubtedly the most popular by far and became fantastically popular very very quickly, and perhaps Captain America). Fantastic Four, X-Men and The Incredible Hulk were the only ones even close to being popular in the mainstream.

The rest of the heroes we've seen in the MCU—Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther—are *much* more 'fringe'. 

And, as much as this may sound crazy or sacrilegious to MCU fans, Spider-Man was the only Marvel hero to come anywhere even close to the mainstream popularity of Superman and Batman. Prior to the development of the MCU Superman and Batman were far, far and away more popular and well-known than aaaaany other Marvel hero. Even now I'd wager if you polled a 'mainstream' audience, people who aren't comic book fans or fans of the film adaptations, the consensus top four popular/recognizable heroes would be Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Wonder Woman."

Everybody talking to their pockets  
Everybody wants a box of chocolates

Everybody knows that you really do  
Everybody knows that you've been faithful  
Oh, give or take a night or two  
Everybody knows you've been discreet  
But there were so many people you just had to meet  
Without your clothes  
Everybody knows  


Everybody knows, everybody knows

Everybody knows  
Everybody knows, everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  


And everybody knows that it's now or never  
Everybody knows that it's me or you  
And everybody knows that you live forever  
When you've done a line or two  
Everybody knows the deal is rotten  
Old Black Joe's still picking cotton  
For your ribbons and bows  
And everybody knows  


And everybody knows that the Plague is coming  
Everybody knows that it's moving fast  
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman  
Are just a shining artifact of the past  
Everybody knows the scene is dead  
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed  
That will disclose  
What everybody knows  


And everybody knows that you're in trouble  
Everybody knows what you've been through  
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary  
To the beach of Malibu  
Everybody knows it's coming apart  
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart  
Before it blows  
Everybody knows"

But I check anyway because I'm paranoid and maybe someone else's kids need checked on. My husband is leaning back in the seat asleep--he'd just worked a 16 hour shift--and the kids are trying to wake him up. The woman followed me out there and I point out my husband and she's just like ""well no one is watching those children.""  

Okay, wtf lady. I wake him up because it's been like three minutes since I was last out dropping off the other load of clean clothes and go in and grab the now finished dryer load.

6847,"I (26M) broke up with my girlfriend (25, with a 5 year old daughter) literally yesterday.

I started dating her in the first place because I thought that a kid was no big deal. My exact words were “We’ll be a good match or we won’t. Either way, her daughter won’t affect that.” I was wrong. 

Her daughter actually played a relatively small role in our relationship. She had plenty of family to watch her daughter while we were out doing other things so I probably only saw her daughter less than a dozen times. When I did see her, she was always a cute, sweet, all around cool little girl. My ex told me straight up at the beginning that she wasn’t looking for someone to be a dad, and I really do believe that she meant it.

The thing is, it’s never that simple. As you progress further and further in a relationship you realize that if you’re serious about being with them long term, you need to be willing to accept their baggage as well. 

For a couple of weeks now, I’ve been gradually coming to terms with the fact that being in a relationship with her meant taking on a relationship with her daughter as well. I’d paid lip service to that idea since the beginning, but only really internalized it recently.

On Saturday, two things happened.

First, she told me that on Friday an ex (not the daughter’s father, but someone who was a father figure to her) showed up at her house asking to spend time with the daughter. 

Second, I met her family. 

Both of these happening drove home something that I’d been realizing more and more. That while I loved spending time with her and loved having her as a girlfriend, I’d never be willing to take on the role of a father figure to her daughter. Despite her insistence otherwise, at some point that would be a necessary step in moving the relationship forward.

Because of this, I subconsciously became okay with integrating her into my life (she’d long since met most of my family and friends, we’d taken road trips together, and she was at my place quite often) but integrating myself into her life became terrifying to me because I knew it was an inevitable step towards fatherhood.

That’s how meeting her family was the last straw, despite them being lovely people who I got along well with on our first meeting. I loved her becoming a bigger and bigger part of my life, but I didn’t want to be a bigger part of hers.

Things clarified for me then, and I came to the conclusion that I’d been leading toward. That I loved spending time with her, but had no interest in developing in our relationship. I had no long term romantic interest in her and wouldn’t ever seriously consider making her a partner in my life.

I respect her too much to waste her time, so yesterday morning I told her we needed to talk and I went to her house and broke it off with her.

It took less than five minutes to do, but it fucking sucked. I’m not sure if she was hiding her feelings from me when I told her or if she was just seething, but she didn’t seem too outwardly upset about it at the time and said she had seen it coming.

I’ve been miserable since then though. She really was a fantastic girlfriend, and if not for her daughter being in the picture, I think we could’ve taken this a long, long way."

Pre ordering has turned from being guaranteed a copy of the game to just getting something “extra.” Such as Beta/Alpha access, extra skins, etc. 

Take this with a grain of salt, but I think that gaming companies are still trying to figure out how the project the potential sales of their game. Before, they could, somewhat, project sales, in some way, based off of pre orders. Now there’s no reason to.

I have friends online that I play with all the time. They always ask me, “Nannerb121, are you going to preorder [X] game” and my answer is always no because if I want, I can buy it the day it comes out or the second it’s available to “pre-install.”

I had a huge crush on a guy in my friend group in college and was so afraid he'd see it and reject me that I would obviously ignore him whenever we met or maybe give a curt nod. All the while I would go out of my way to try to bump into him between classes. My thought process was that if he showed interest despite my apparent disinterest then I wouldn't be rejected.

Yeah. Made sense at the time but now I just cringe at the ""logic."" Even if he had been attracted to me I'm sure he didn't want to be rejected by the apparently cactus hearted quiet chick with resting bitch face. Guys have feelings too, turns out."

6944,"Long term relationships naturally have ebbs and flows. It’s not always going to be super hot passionate, can’t keep your hands off each other, hormone fueled freaky sex and that’s just fine. 
 
 
Sometimes it’s buying your first house together or having a baby or moving across the country or getting new jobs. Sometimes it’s experiencing a death of a parent or trashing your vacation fund to save your old dog with liver disease. Sometimes it’s staying up til 4am Christmas Eve drinking wine and putting together a dollhouse for your kid. Sometimes it’s watching YouTube videos together of pugs falling down and laughing to tears. Sometimes it’s letting go of that grudge for not being able to fold a damn shirt properly. 

 
I don’t think there’s a single thing you can do to keep your relationship fresh and exciting. I think it’s waking up each day thankful that you’ve found your person to do life with and (generally) treating each day as a step forward together. Take time to appreciate him/her. Maybe they still haven’t unpacked that fucking bag from the trip last weekend but they did fix the leaky faucet and that’s sexy af.

If it had happened several times in your life that random people had said ""you have a nice beard"" and then immediately punched you in the face, you'd be very wary as soon as you heard that phrase.

Unfortunately, some of these you really don’t want to cook. It used to be my favorite thing but I haven’t tasted watermelon in 20 years. Also, the intensity of the symptoms got worse over time.

So we're playing and having fun and making a couple of inappropriate jokes about colonialism, being robber barons, conquering lands, and so forth. And in true college fashion we were also talking about girls, so there was some bleeding over back and forth between topics.

I don't precisely recall how the topic came up, but we were talking about something like what you would do if you found out your wife was cheating on you. So me and my buddies are ""innocently"" joking about how you'd do this, or do that, and keeping our jokes centered around the game we were playing, you know things like, ""Well you can't win a land war in Asia so there's not much you can do about it.""

Suddenly the guy gets really serious and just shakes his head and says, ""No, that isn't what you do. You cut her hand off.""

Whole room gets really awkwardly quiet. Someone makes a joke after a minute and everyone moves on. Later when we were taking the game back to the front desk my buddy and I were talking about how it probably isn't a good idea to play games like that, or have conversations like that with the exchange student anymore, because he, ""actually knows what he's talking about."""

He lied about everything, from the most pointless and mundane things to making up totally unbelieveable grandiose bullshit. We both loved South Park as kids and he idolized Cartman, to the point that he would try to act like him, talk like him, harbored really fucked up extreme right wing views, had a very fucked up sense of humor (which I admit I found funny as a kid), etc. It was all really fucking weird. I eventually cut him out of my life because I just had enough of his lies and personality, and we also just grew apart and into very different people once we went to college at different schools. After a while it was clear that this was just who he was and he wouldn't grow out of it, and his views and jokes became less and less funny to me the more evident it was that he seriously believed the crap that came out of his mouth. But the thing that bugs me the most looking back on it is, I don't get why he felt the need to lie to me and put on this whole mask when he was around me. Like, I'm your friend dude! You can be yourself around me! I feel bad for cutting him out of my life because I completely ghosted him at a certain point and I haven't contacted him since.

I'm a single dad with a 6 year old. With me working 40 or more hours a week it's tough to spend a lot of time with her, especially when I just want some alone time.

She has a tablet, plays games on it, and watches Netflix. But she also goes to the pool with me all the time during the summer, was in tee ball and dance, reads books she brings home from school, and plays outside a ton.

And I see tons of kids doing the exact same thing. 

It was not much different when I was a kid. I watched VHS tapes instead of Netflix, played Nintendo instead of Minecraft, and when I was older was on AOL chat instead of Discord.

My parents had their own ""kid vices"" as well and it wasn't like my grandparents spent every waking minute raising them. They worked a ton too, and back then I think kids had to fend for themselves even more.

I went to a LARP once that was like this. As a newbie, I was required to play various trash mobs throughout the course of the night. Everyone was way in character, and even trash mobs got costume and makeup. It made the few character breaks even more hilarious, and made the whole thing more relaxed (easier to be someone else when you're dressed as someone else).

What I received was an unholy (foam) beatdown, and when I collapsed to my appropriately trashy death...slammed my knee on a rock (it was nighttime, couldn't see shit).

7028,"I’m really surprised Tiger Woods hasn’t been mentioned here. He holds, imo, three golf records which will never be beaten.

1. Tiger’s first Major was the 1997 Masters, which he won by 12 strokes (with a 4 day score of -18, which in itself is a record equaled only by Jordan Spieth in 2015). The next highest margin of victory is 9 strokes, by Jack Nicklaus over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player in 1965.

2. Tiger demolishing the 2000 US Open field at Pebble Beach, where he won by **15 strokes**, the highest in any Major. To put it into perspective, the next highest record (that Tiger broke) was Old Tom Morris’ victory at the 1862 Open (14 strokes). Tiger was also the only player to shoot under par at the 2000 US Open.

3. Probably the most impressive of his records, Tiger made 142 consecutive cuts in a row. For those of you who aren’t familiar with this concept, a cut is a method of disqualification when players ranked over the median after two days of a tournament are disqualified for the 3rd and 4th round. In order to make 142 consecutive cuts in a row, Tiger shot pretty much under the median for 284 rounds over a 7 year period, which is mind boggling considering that he played nearly every tournament without taking a break during that time period. This was also during a period when he was winning pretty much every other tournament he took part in. "

I always go fishing in the ocean, and I live in Maine on the East Coast. Anyways, this must have been last summer I went to go fishing with my cousin lets say Andrew, and we would set up our rods on the surf and go fishing from there. We typically set everything up before the sun is down. I can't remember exactly why but Andrew had to go home early one day and he was the one with the car, but I decided to stay behind to continue fishing it was a pretty good night so far already landed one fish. (and I couldn't stop it there right?)  It must have been 40 minutes after sunset he left and all of the last streams of light were disappearing from the sky as the moon lit up the beach-head around me so I went back to my seat I set up and with my lamp started to read my book. The moon was full and the sky full of stars around me the ocean shimmering and still it was beautiful not another soul on the beach at this time of night. During the day theres a few people that will walk by and its not uncommon to see another fisherman while your on the beach.

An hour or so passes by and I haven't had a hit on my rod in the longest time so I decide to switch the type of bait I'm using to something different, so I bring my tackle down to the surf and begin to reel in one of my rods and while I'm standing ankle deep in the cold Atlantic, I see someone standing hunched down in the surf maybe 60 or so odd meters away from me. Being me I was a little shocked I didn't notice this person before there is one typical entrance to the beach where everyone who wants to see the ocean goes through which is right near where I have my seat and lamp set up. So I anchor my rod and decide start to wave and try to see who it is. I start to walk over and as I got closer and closer it looked almost like a child/young kid from their height just looking facedown into the shallow water. I continued to walk and call to him/her concerned admittedly at this point for this kid. 

But as I got closer and in the moonlight instead of seeing a shirt and whatnot they were covered in these grey scales, grey shiny scales. I saw on its back a spine like a fish with long quills coming out and webbing connecting them. I was maybe 15 feet away from it at this point. And by the time I realized this it was too late, I stood there as it began to get up where a humans face I thought would be there was a snout like a dog and big black eyes like a shark. With those eyes it looked over and me and I at it. I stood there perfectly still as it began to look up at the sky opened its mouth and let out a horrifying sound. I'm not sure best how to describe that sound, I have never heard nor hopefully will ever again hear anything even like it. It sounded hurt in some strange way. And just like that it waded its way back out into the waves and into the ocean. "

7047,"Now I can finally tell this incident that happened some 3-4 years ago.

I was on my way to a friend's birthday party and I hitched a ride with said friend's mom to go pick up the other guests. We drove to an older neighborhood, tiny houses and bad pavement but it was considered a historical area so the residents couldn't modify it. We picked up a friend and as were were pulling out of the area, my friend's mom says ""Do you guys want to see something weird?"" We say yes. She drives across the main street that divided the historical neighborhood from the shopping centers and goes into yet another area with old houses, but she's making these snaking turns through the neighborhoods. We keep going deeper and deeper in, and finally she goes into this neighborhood where all of the houses are on either side of this large and long roundabout with 5 identical houses in the middle, all with red gates over them.

She slows down and tells us, ""There's a very rich old man who owns all of these houses right here, and he renovated them to look completely identical to each other down to the rooms and windows.

He has cats in all of those houses, each one has their own room. A cleaner lady who worked for him was outside and she stopped and told me everything when I was walking near here.""

We drove out of there and went to the party, but each time I passed through that main area of shopping centers, I'd try to look for that same neighborhood of the crazy cat man. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find it. There was nothing in the newspapers or news channels about this mysterious old man, how he got his money, where he got these cats from, or even his name. Nobody has heard of or believes me when I tell them that somewhere in our city is 5 identical gated houses filled with cats. "

7053,"I'm a bartender and one night a couple months back a guy came in about an hour before close and drank a couple beers up until last call. He ordered another after last call and asked to close his tab (we hold credit cards for open tabs), we had people still drinking so I figured why not. His card was declined so I let him know and he tried to use the ATM where he was declined again. He made a call and said his brother was on his way with money to pay his $10 tab. No problem, just hang out while I clean up and get all of my closing stuff done and wait for my friends to show up before hitting the town ourselves. My friends show up have a drink and we're all waiting around for this guy to pay his tab. After an hour passed I told him I had to leave and not worry about the $10 and that I would pay it out of my pocket but he wasn't allowed back in until he paid up. He freaked out and told me to go fuck myself and stormed out. 

Months pass and just last week a regular introduces me to his friend as I walk into my shift. I didn't even recognize his friend until he said I was ""that douchebag bartender who kicked me out a while back over $7"". I asked him to leave and he threw a $5 bill at me as he stormed out. I don't think I'll be seeing that guy again"

It was a huge party with hundreds of only white people attending, and only black servers (weird). That was a red flag, but then my host’s father sat me down and told me about the “War of Northern Aggression”, Abraham Lincoln (the “bloodthirsty tyrant”), and how the south will rise again. At the end of the ball the band played the song Dixie. I was then given a party favor: a gold-plated cotton flower. It was one of the craziest experiences of my life.

Worked at a fancy  hotel that had revolving doors and the front desk just inside the doors - one winter the heater that makes the air lock inside the revolving doors went kaput, and no one thought it was important enough to immediately fix. Because it doesn't impact guest experience, you see. 

I can tell you, I was wearing full length long johns under my suit, complete with undershirt, dress shirt, vest and suit jacket, and was still freezing my arse off. But we were expected to remain polished in appearance and act like nothing was the matter. Stifle those chattering teeth, we can't have guests in full winter gear realizing something in the hotel is broken and neglected! 

I tell you, sometimes I could see my breath when speaking to guests. My fingers would go numb from the knuckle to tip while typing. I dropped credit cards and room keys during every single check in as I could not feel my goddamn fingers! 

Kept complaining and management kept stalling, likely because the repairs cost $$$ especially when it's dead winter and the service companies know you need heat back NOW. 

So I caved and donned a toque and gloves and whenever a guest inquisitively asked what the regalia was for, I cheerfully and pleasantly explained the broken heater in the entranceway was causing subzero temperatures in the hotel lobby,  and the fact that without extra warm things, I was losing feeling in my extremeties. 

Sometimes this horrified the kinder hearted guests, and if they expressed concern, I'd thank them deeply and upgrade them for free them to a room ""as far away from the broken doors"" as possible, citing their concern of drafts reaching their rooms as the cause for the free upgrade. 

Management took notice, heater fixed. "

* Plucky non-verbal robot escapes Empire and wanders around a desert planet

* Plucky robot comes into ownership from young native(?) of desert planet who has always dreamed of leaving

* Sandy protagonist is chased by the Empire, but escapes the desert planet on the Millennium Falcon

* Giant ball of planet-killing (Death Star) is used

* Good guys have to destroy said Death Star

* Good guys send a bunch of X-wings and blow up Death Star while Leia watches from a base

* Also there's a good guy that gets tortured by the villain

* Also there's a seedy bar with a bunch of aliens

* Also the protagonist's elderly mentor is murdered by lightsaber on the Death Star

* Also the villain is a guy in all-black full-body armor

&gt; Invisible tracking happens in all sorts of ways; ads are just the visible tip of the iceberg. Privacy Badger sends the [Do Not Track signal](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) to trackers telling them not to track you. If they ignore your wishes, your Badger will learn to block them—whether they are advertisers or trackers of other kinds.

The Do Not Track signal is pretty meaningless. There's no governing body that enforces it and it doesn't really do what you think it does. Do Not Track means the people collecting your info, if they decide to adhere to it, agree not to use your info to advertise things to you. Nothing is stopping them from continuing to collect your info though.

Been here for a year now btw.

They pull us over for shit like speeding when we weren't, and allegedly having tail lights or plate lights out when we don't. This has happened like 6 times in the last 4 or 5 months. Same cops even. It's bullshit. Practically harassment.

Edit: I find it important to note, since everyone is taking the cops side and giving me shit, we're considered part-time residents since we are students. This law applies only to full-time, permanent residents. The cops know this, and we've told them we are students each and every time. The same ones keep giving us a hard time. At some point they have to take responsibility.

Also, the ""most likely moving"" in the OP refers strictly to the amount of time until we move back. Moving back is inevitable, but I haven't decided whether I'm taking on some additional classes, which would keep me in school another semester. I'm moving back to PA regardless. The cops know this.

Then you would also need to still have a beater car for trips to go hiking or go to the grocery store, or something simple like that.

A famous story real sports covered was about 3 NFL players who went fishing off the coast of Florida. They weren’t avid boaters and tried taking off with the anchor still hooked under water. The boat flips and the 3 men are now stuck off the coast in cold water with a storm coming in. One of the saddest parts of the story is help actually did fly over them 2 times but the bottom of the boat, which is now the only thing visible, was white making it look like the cracks of the waves from rough waters. All three men started to show signs of hypothermia. The first guy to die literally rips his clothes off and just starts swimming under water. Away from The boat. The only one who was still coherent had to watch his friend swim off to his death because he couldn’t risk going to go try to help him because of the rough water and the other player he is helping on the capsized boat. The second guy ended up dying from hypothermia as well and luckily the last guy was saved. What saved him was that he was wearing more clothes than his buddies before the boat flipped. 

Here is more info about the players. It was actually 4 players and only 2 nfl players and 2 former college players. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ2VXyOg7OA

Here is an article about the incident. You second paragraph talks about how they took off their life jackets and what have you and just swam into the sea. That was the hypothermia talking. This source doesn’t talk about the hypothermia but real sports on the full episode said that’s what made the other 2 men take off their clothes and just swim down into the water.

7334,"Marine microbial ecologist here. I literally study aspects of this topic.

**No. Just no. I've seen this doomsday story elsewhere on reddit, and its completely wrong.**

Certainly, researchers are interested in what will happen to the changing ecology of the microplankton community as the oceans warm and as pH falls. However, your scenario is outrageously alarmist.

First and foremost, half the oxygen produced globally is released by land plants. Secondly, another double-digit percentage of global photosynthetically-produced oxygen is generated by photosynthetic *bacteria*--belonging to the genera *Prochlorococcus* and *Synechococcus*. Bacterial metabolic rates scale linearly with temperature within the reasonable range of likely ocean temperatures (present and future), and so some scientists are currently investigating whether these photosynthetic cyanobacteria will do **better** under a warming ocean. Furthermore, bacteria have short generation times and evolve rapidly. Microbes are generally going to be the organisms that are least concerned with climate change--at the speed at which climate change occurs (even in the event of catastrophic climate feedbacks such as methane hydrate release/permafrost thaw, etc...) they are likely to be the **most** resilient organisms to warming oceans.

The pace at which ocean acidification occurs is similarly slow in microbial terms. Additionally, only certain marine phytoplankton taxa may be existentially threatened by ocean acidification, and even then this research question is famous for its uncertainly. Laboratory and field experiments have in fact produced a stunning range of contradictory results about whether calcium carbonate-based marine microplankton (microplankton, not corals or shellfish, mind) are in fact impaired at all by even dramatic changes in ocean acidification.

There are many interesting aspects to how climate change will affect phytoplankton, certainly. The fact of the matter is, however, that currently the scientific community isn't particularly certain about the sign that this effect will have--whether marine photosynthetic microbes will sequester **more** carbon (thereby producing more oxygen) or less. 

Also, use your brain. Microplankton deal with far greater variability in temperature over the course of the year. If a diatom can survive both winter and summer in temperate or polar waters, an additional 2 or 3 degrees C really doesn't present much of an evolutionary challenge.

There is a concern that due to warming surface waters, the surface ocean will stratify more due to temperature-governed differences in density. This may cut off the supply of inorganic nutrients from deeper ocean waters to the surface in tropical oceans and during the summer elsewhere. Such a change may promote a shift of phytoplankton community structure away from larger phytoplankton and towards more nutrient stress-tolerant cyanobacteria. While this may affect oceanic carbon storage (edit: and will **definitely** affect global fisheries' productivity), note that phytoplankton taxa are **replacing** one another under this scenario--the total rate of marine photosynthesis is unlikely to change on a level sufficient to affect global atmospheric oxygen concentration.

TL;DR, the plankton will still be here on Earth in substantial concentrations under conditions that would kill most macroscopic life. Rapid microbial evolution insulates microplankton against even sudden changes in ocean conditions. Also, trees.

Terrible website that I was just about to cancel my account on. Got a message out of the blue from a pretty redhead girl asking how many polo shirts I owned (I made a joke about it on my profile). 


We met for coffee a few days later, and after sitting in the coffee shop talking for a few hours, went and got lunch at a BBQ joint down the road (her suggestion), she had to leave in a hurry for evening mass, but wanted to come by later to ""watch a movie"". We watched a movie, and then did much else besides. It was the only time I've ever had sex on the first date (she insists it was our second, since she went to mass in between). We quickly hit it off, and when her folks needed a place to stay for a bit six months later, she moved in to my place while they stayed at hers.

After about a year and a half, I proposed at a sip and paint, and then June 24th, 2018, we got married on the banks of the yellowstone river. The same BBQ restaurant catered our wedding..."

He would get the water set up, turn on the baby monitor (old school audio only, nothing creepy) then I'd get to play for what felt like forever. Mom never let me play for very long in the bath at her house, so I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

Found out when I was in college that my bathtime was the only time was the only time he could reliably go out in the garage to smoke a joint when it was his week to have me. The year before (when I was two or three) I complained to my grandma that her cigarettes were smellier than dad's. She knew he didn't smoke cigarettes and apparently he got in trouble from her and my mom for smoking pot in front of me. So he wasn't allowed to smoke in the house if I were there. And if he waited till I was asleep, I'd wake up and go see what he was doing outside because I was an inquisitive kiddo and the door to the garage was loud.

I still like the smell of pot way more than tobacco.  I still associate it with having a fun time. Never smoked it myself, though."

7378,"High school teacher here; way too many students to discuss. All my students have had an impact on me (sometimes not good, mostly incredibly great), but there is 1 that really sticks out.

A 14 year old student of mine (lets call him Joe) was always really quiet. He wasnt shy, you could tell he wanted to make friends, but he didnt know how to. He was treated badly by his dad (made fun of him, called him names and belittled him regularly) so I tried boosting his confidence. I let him know how smart and funny he was, and how proud I was of him. He would come to me for advice or help, or just hung out when he needed a safe place.

In the 11th grade (when he was 17 years old),  he came to class hurt. Like really hurt. Bloody and bruised...it was obvioud he had been beaten horribly. I begged him to tell me what happened and when he finally did, I wish he hadn't. His dad found out he was gay and tried to ""beat the gay"" out of him. He didnt go to a doctor; instead he came to me because he trusted me and felt safe when I was around. He was hurt so bad that he was actually hospitalized for over a week. I held his hand in the ambulance and cried for him when he told us what he went through.

Him coming to me that day humbled me. It showed me that even though we may not realize it, we do have an impact on others' lives. It made me want to be a better person/teacher, and it made me listen more when kids talk."
7379,"I went to school with a girl like this. We clicked at first due to similar interests and being in some classes together. Eventually we started to do projects together. That's when I started to notice her compulsive lying. She was recruited by Harvard, but chose to go to our community college to be close to family. Harvard recruits people? I'm not sure, as I'm not really Harvard material, but I've never heard of the Ivy Leagues recruiting people. Then she starts talking about how this one class is going to ruin her 4.0. I knew she failed a math class the previous semester, so she couldn't possibly have a 4.0. I don't think it's a big deal that she doesn't have a 4.0, but why lie about something so obvious? She talks about how famous hockey players have been to her house (this one could be plausible, as our town had a junior league team and some of the players either attend the private all boys school or one of the public schools in a nearby suburb) and that she talks to them all the time. The kicker was one night we were supposed to do a project together, and she told me she was in the hospital. This was plausible to me, as she has had numerous health problems in the past (that I've witnessed). Thinking that she was actually sick, I rushed and got everything done. The next day, she's in class talking about how she hooked up with her ex and drove to Cleveland for the weekend. I was livid. We were forced to be partners for the remainder of the semester, but I cut off contact with her after that. She wound up dropping out."

I have a genital piercing that came undone when we were having sex once and she got it afterwards, and she comes in and goes “Told you it was tight”

She’d constantly come in when everything was fine and running smooth and just start screaming that we weren’t working fast enough. She’d stress out customers with how vile she’d be to everyone. And when she thought we weren’t doing good enough she’d jump in to help but slowed us down so much cause she didn’t know what the fuck she was doing at all. 
So one day for whatever reason she told one of my coworkers to go home early on a busy day. There’s supposed to be three of us there at all times. Instead it was just me and Alex we’ll call him. Alex had been there a while. Never took anything seriously and spent his time texting his girlfriend. This day when it was just me and him he decided to take a two hour phone call with his girl since the boss was out and I had just learned to wait by myself. I was handling hosting, waiting, drive-thru, cashiering, and take out orders like a mofuckin boss! But it got a lil busy so I was a little behind since it is a very popular place and it was just me. After being gone all day my boss walks in and sees we’re a little behind. She immediately sees me and starts going apeshit.
She starts cursing up a storm and all the customers watch as she gets closer and closer to me just saying foul ass shit and starts to throw objects in my direction and breaking all kinds of shit. Right then and there I knew I had to get out or I was about to backhand this foul little lady. 
I calmly told her “fuck this. I don’t need this job that bad.” And I walked right out and left them with all that rush of customers to figure out everything for themselves."

I couldn't put my finger on it because they were both nice enough and very charismatic, but I just had a bad feeling about them. So much so, that I spent nearly the entire engagement party hanging out with my best friend's fiancé and his groomsmen as opposed to my best friend and the rest of the bridesmaids to stay away from this girl. 

About a week later my best friend invited the two of us over for dinner. Since my best friend clearly liked this girl so much, I decided to brush my ill feeling about this girl off, and I went to dinner. As it turned out, I was totally fine with her that night so the three of us ended up making plans to go out to the bar the next evening. The next night, things were once again going great, no ill feeling about this girl, so when my best friend said she had to leave as she had work in the morning, I decided I would stay and continue to hang out with this girl. Now she had been playfully flirting with the bartender all night, I hadn't been thinking much of it, and figured she was just doing it to get free drinks since she's married. But AS SOON as my best friend left, her flirting with the bartender became very sexual. At one point she got up to go to the bathroom, the bartender also disappeared, and when she returned 20 minutes later, she started bragging to me about how she had just had sex with the bartender in his car. It's safe to say, I made an excuse and left pretty quickly after that because I wasn't about to be a party to her infidelity. I let my best friend know what happened as soon as I left, and told her that I wouldn't be hanging out with this girl anymore, but she was more than welcome to continue being friends with her if she wished. My best friend was completely shocked and appalled, and cut ties with this girl pretty quickly after that. 

Now fast forward a year, I'm reading the news paper, and I see a headline that reads Ponzi Scheme in the town of our old high school rivals. Laughing to myself, I though ""Oh this ought to be good!"", since you know, I spent the first 18 years of my life making fun of this town, and started reading. Now I get to the first name of the of the two people involved and I realize that I recognize that name but I can't seem to put my finger on why I know that name. That was until I read the second name. IT WAS THAT GIRL! Basically she and her husband were running a PONZI SCHEME and stole almost 1 million dollars under the guise of him being an investment banker. Turns out as well, at the time that she was hanging out with my best friend, she was trying to get her and her fiancé to invest their wedding fund with her husband, and they were about to do it until my best friend cut ties with her because she cheated on her husband that night she was or with me. Such scummy people. "

7492,"Obligatory: Not a stereotypical porn plot story but......

In college I worked at a pizza place and the morning/lunch delivery driver, named Tony, who would swear that he was ALWAYS offered sex for pizza and that they were ALWAYS these sexy women who were all 10's . This guy was a really fat slob in his 50's with a terrible mustache who delivered pizza in the afternoon. Somehow I doubted that all of these sexy women would: 1) Live in this shithole college town littered with meth addicts and bored college kids, 2) Be ordering pizza from a shitty pizza place for lunch, and 3) Offer sex for food.

Since encountering this guy and his claims, I find the pizza guy porn plot hard to believe in an IRL situation. I'm sure it happens of course but after Tony got fired, I started delivering. And through all my time as a delivery driver I never got propositioned once; and I would later work the daytime and nighttime delivery times. Of course this could be attributed to a number of things. Perhaps the 10/10 sexy girls left when Tony was fired for stealing or maybe my college aged body was inferior to that of a 50 year old fat guy. We'll never know. But I do know that I have been offered tools for pizza (tools as in wrenches and drills, you animals). And I have been told that they'll write me a check for the pizza while telling me that they know it will bounce. Also I have been given a full fucking jar of pennies with the line of ""Not sure how much is in there but you can have all of it and if its more, that's a sweet tip"". I'm not sure if these were offers for sex but they were all said to me by different middle aged dudes who were all Jim Lahey level drunk. "

I still remember my dad and brother coming back in the car with tears saying we should keep going to we until we get reception so we can notify services as there wasn't much else they could do.

It wasn't until years later that it briefly came up that I realised why there wasn't much we could've done. There were enough people to help lift the car enough to remove the pressure but there wasn't a rock or something big enough to hold it up and they couldn't hold it up forever. Eventually they'd have to put the car back down on her legs because they couldn't hold it up any longer and she was stuck so couldn't be pulled out.

I don't know what happened to her but we had contacted the services as soon as we got reception and heard the services did get to her. But we don't know if she survived with her legs or at all."

7559,"1. Involve yourself in your community. Whether this means participating in your local government, or volunteering with community groups, local communities are the root of our society and any impact you can make there, can have a much broader influence.
2. Use valid fact checking platforms to ensure your understanding of key issues comes from a place of truth. Seek accuracy, and thoughtfully address your peers that promote false narratives. Social media has become significant in how the world deems information valuable, and whether we like it or not, that's not going away.
3. Don't give extremists the attention they want. This should be self-explanatory, but all I'm saying is don't validate people who seek to inflame outrage. Instead, focus your efforts on those that don't already have their opinions set, and do so with consideration and meaningful communication.
4. Vote. I don't care if you think it doesn't matter, it's minimal effort and if we want it to mean something, we need to do it.
5. Don't just stop at boycotting straws, or plastic bags, or whatever. In the grand scheme, those are minor. Fishing gear is the largest plastic polluter in the ocean, agricultural runoff destroys environments, etc. Make those small changes, but also promote and support sustainable practices that have those larger impacts.
6. Call/write your reps when you feel strongly about an issue, and encourage others to do so as well.
7. Lastly, just be conscientious and understanding of how your experience differs from others'. Don't assume a problem that one person is experiencing isn't important because you're not experiencing it. Imagine it on a small scale, when someone tells you a family member has died you don't respond by wondering why no one is talking about your dog that died when you were a kid, you give your support and lend an ear or a shoulder to lean on. If more people did the same in response to the bigger issues at play, the world would be a much better place."

One day, corporate quality came by, and our quality site lead was talking about our programs to promote quality work. It was a raffle. If you performed quality work, and someone witnessed you doing it, they could give you a raffle ticket. The prize for winning the raffle? 30 bucks worth of points.

Meaning if I wanted to do a certain mission that required me to, say, send my sim to work, I would literally send him to work, and wait 8 real-life hours for him to come back. But you could speed it up using real money! The breaking point was when they had a special event that allowed me to get an exclusive accessory for my town that I really wanted. I started doing the missions required to get it, and right when I had one mission left, I ran out of time. The event ended. No fucking joke, you had to devote all your free time to this shitty fucking game to get your reward, and if you so much as went an hour without making your sim do the next task, you were fucked, unless you coughed up $5 to make Bob the sim take a shit. Deleted the game, never looked back. That kind of formula doesn't work for any game. I don't want to have to wait several real hours to do something in the game, I wanna play the fucking game and not be cut off right when the action begins!      

Imagine playing the new Red Dead Redemption, except right in the middle of a shootout, the game cuts you off and says ""you must wait 5 hours to continue, or give us your actual hard earned money so you can play the game"".

This friend was gorgeous and a little flirty with me whenever she came over. So, one night, out having a few drinks, we hooked up. Just kissing and shit.

She stopped coming over for the next while and, as it turned out, felt that the whole thing was a mistake because she had just broken up with a guy she was in love with and hoped that she could patch things up with him.

She felt awful for leading me on and I told her not to worry about it. I mean, I liked her a lot, but fuck it. She hugged me and insisted we'd be good friends. Emphasizing friends and nothing more. And also saying that all three of us should go to her place next weekend to watch a movie as friends.

I didn't really want to go at first. Roommate talked me into it, but cute friend had come down with a terrible cold in the meantime.

Roommate tells her that we might as well watch it anyway if she's just lying in bed, and she agrees.

We go over. All three of us sitting on her bed. Her in her pyjamas, runny nose, hot water bottle, surrounded by tissues, and wrapped in a duvet.

She's downing cough medicine and can barely stay awake. After twenty minutes, she falls asleep and is snoring.

Roommate gets a text from work asking if she can come in because somebody called in sick. We whisper goodbyes and she leaves.

I watch the rest of the movie and get up to leave. Cute friend sleepily wakes up and apologizes for being such a mess.

I tell her not worry about and ask if I can get her anything but she says she's OK and she'll see me again sometime.

I go home and Roommate asks me how it went.

I say it was fine and ask why she's not at work.

She looks at me like I'm an idiot and says, *""Well? Did you hook up with her?""*

I say no and she rolls her eyes and calls the friend.

They're in agreement. I'm an idiot.

I had top slow down to get around it and if another vehicle was coming one had to wait. 

One summer my brother had parked his car on the street outside of my parents house and around 2 in the morning or so we heard this violent crash outside and my brother and I ran out to find his car had been hit  and was about 10 yards away from where it was parked and in the middle of the street.

7790,"If anyone reading this is confused, in most countries they have what's called progressive tax. This definitely applies to the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, and NZ - not sure about other countries. The way it works is, there are multiple tax brackets which have different tax rates:

e.g.
$0 - $20,000 is 0% tax  
$20,001 - $50,000 is 15% tax  
$50,001 - 80,000 is 30% tax  
$80,001 or more is 45% tax

When you calculate your tax for the year, you pay the given tax rate for any money earned within that bracket, but *not* the money earned below or above that bracket. As you earn more money that moves you into a higher tax bracket, only the money *above* the lower end of the tax bracket is taxed at the higher rate.

It's probably best explained with an example.

Here's how it *doesn't* work:

John earned $60,000. The tax rate for $50,001 - $80,000 is 30%, as seen above, therefore John pays 30% ($18,000) in tax. This is wrong!

Here's how it *does* work:

John earned $60,000. Using the tax brackets above, he pays 0% tax on the first $20,000 earned, then he pays 15% tax on anything earned above $20,000 but less than $50,000, and then finally he pays 30% tax on anything earned above $50,000. So his tax would look like this:

$0 - $20,000 at 0% = $0 tax  
$20,001 - $50,000 at 15% = $4500 in tax  
$50,001 - $60,000 at 30% = $3000 in tax

So John's total tax would be $7500 for the year.

While I've got your attention, another common misconception is *tax deductions*. It should be noted that a deduction on your tax isn't a deduction on your tax bill, but a deduction on your taxable income (or at least that's how it works in Oz, I assume the same for the US and the UK and other countries). Therefore, you won't get 100% of the deduction back, you'll just get back whatever tax would have been paid on that amount. e.g. If you claim $1000 for work-related training, your tax return will increase by around $300 probably, because you're just getting the tax back and not the full amount."

So if they brought their 1 year old.  They’d pay $1.  Which to be fair is a pretty great deal, given they cost around $20 dollars I believe.  

People drove even a few hours to get to a store. Because of the massive lines stores got, even before the stores/event opened.  They were already having to send people home, cutting the lines off at a certain point.  

The way parents, mostly moms had complained about this... you’d think it was something like the holy grail 😂😂😂  and some acted like children, like they were completely entitled to this.  And said they’d never shop there again.  

But other parents made the situation as best as possible.  My favorite one was probably a mom brought her daughter to Target that was near by, let her pick her own stuffed animal , a unicorn! And she picked where they ate lunch.  
Saying how yes it sucks the line was cut off before them, but sometimes that’s how life works.  

So some parents took this as a teaching lesson. While others were having tantrums about this.  "

7843,"Our senior year of college, my friend (let's call her Emma) called me excitedly after the first day of classes one semester to tell me about a cute guy she'd met in class. He sat next to her. He was super good looking, seemed a little bit older, and had invited her back to his dorm after class. Emma didn't want to go back to the dorm of a guy she had just met, but they had exchanged names &amp; phone numbers. She was excited to get to know him more. 

A few days later, we hung out together and I asked about this new guy. I wanted to see a picture of him, but we noticed that we couldn't find a trace of him on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. Strange, especially for undergrad college students in 2017. 

I had this weird hunch and typed his full name into Google. The articles that popped up were terrifying. Apparently, this guy was nearly 25 years old. When he was 18 he attended a different state school in the Midwest and got kicked out his freshman year for drunkenly raping a fellow student who was walking home to her dorm alone at night. Not only was he convicted, he spent quite a few years in jail. I should also mention that in his confession, he asked that if the girl didn't want to be raped, ""What was she doing walking around a college campus late at night?"" . It was later found out that she was walking home from the library. She had a big test the next week. 

I was so confused for so many reasons. How the fuck was he accepted into our school with a rape conviction and five years in prison under his belt? Not only that, but he was staying in one of our school's co-ed dorms, which I found incredibly disturbing. Emma was equally as freaked out by this information. 

She stopped talking to him, but the next time she went to class he had already switched his interests to another female in the class. 

I anonymously let it slip to one of school's over-zealous social justice student groups that a convicted rapist was living at the dorms. They basically raised hell until he was officially kicked out. It got to the point where he would've had to move out of the dorms regardless if the school officially kicked him out or not, because rumor has it that one of our frats put a bounty for a couple hundred on his head to whoever could jump the dude.

It was this line of thinking that got me here, honestly. 

For me? I cope by not thinking about it. For me it *is* hopeless. It's utterly hopeless. I'm too logical to think otherwise. Hope means I have a path. 

You say ""It's only money"" but that one item is more essentially than nearly any other tangible product.

My plan is to pay the minimums until I either die or hit the lottery.

Current repayment has me debt free by the time I'm in my 60s. 

It's honestly a miserable situation and the only solutions are: time, money, or suicide. As it stands I'll never own a home and won't be able to start a family (I won't start a family unless I'm no longer living paycheck to paycheck). 

It is what it is. I was 18 and made my own choices, I (much like many others) just really wish I could take that choice back.

The Death Worm is a legless creature that lives in sandy deserts, has some kind of crest or antennae, and can apparently electrocute people. The Basilisk is another legless creature that lives in sandy deserts, had a crest on its head, and was so venomous that if a man on a horse speared one, the ""venom"" would *travel up the spear* and kill both him and his horse.

Considering how good of a conductor sand is, and that multiple kinds of fish can generate electricity, it seems kind of plausible that some other animal might exist that has that kind of defense mechanism. In ancient Greek times, people weren't all that familiar with electricity and nobody had ever heard of an electric eel, so if somebody just dropped dead after spearing a weird snakey-looking animal, an electric shock probably wouldn't have been the first explanation they thought of."

7919,"The TI89 was ~130 bucks back when I was HS.  I saved from my part time job and bought it.  It was a true marvel, it could do limits, integrals, and derivatives!   At the time you needed a computer and Maple, neither were cheap.  It was really mostly a novelty to me, especially since my friend got one and was showing it off everyone so next thing you know it got banned.  

Anyway, got to college, and it's not allowed in any class I would want to use it in.  Actually every one of my math classes through DiffEQ didn't allow calculator at all, physics and chemistry only allowed basic scientific calculators.  So yea.  I lost track of it and lost it.  

Fast forward, I go back to school as an adult for Finance (I have a good career but I'm bored with it) and the nostalgic person in me wanted a TI-89.  I go over to Amazon, and it's the exact same damn price it was in 1998.  Wtf?  Inflation has made it technically cheaper sure, but it's still not cheap!  Anyway, I couldn't resist, I bought it and do quite enjoy doing really basic math on it. Ha. "

Anyway, a few weeks after the guy moves in my Uncle gets an angry phone call.  He's been hearing scratching sounds in the night, he thinks my Grandad is haunting him because of the previous enmity between him and his Dad. After my Uncle stopped laughing at the absurdity of it, he told the guy it was a 17th century farmhouse and he should get himself some decent mousetraps, or adopt a cat.  The scratching noises should stop soon afterwards.

I don't know if there's such a thing as Heaven, but I guarantee if there is my Grandad is there tending God's garden and the last thing on his mind is haunting some guy he never met."

8010,"Kind of tame compared to a lot of the things people here have seen, but it did a lot of damage that I'm still dealing with today. I caught my mom cheating on my dad with a houseguest, a man everyone considered a great friend. 

Some backstory: Houseguest was a long time family friend. He and my uncle met while they were working on a farm together years and years before this, and my family just sort of adopted him and his wife and kids.

At the time of the story, houseguest was working as a long haul trucker while going through a particularly nasty divorce. My dad offered him our spare bedroom while houseguest was in town so he didn't have to pay for a hotel or sleep in the same house as his crazy ex.

The night in question, houseguest was freshly home from a very long job. He had a lot of extra money to play with and he was glad to be off the road, so that weekend he bought a shit load of booze for him and my parents and they decided they'd celebrate.

I should mention that at the time I was very young and very naive. I couldn't have been older than 13. I know that sounds too old, but I was very sheltered and so so [i]so[/i] naive. I really couldn't see what was going on. I just knew that I hated when they would all get together and drink. Mom got weird, houseguest got weird, and dad got pissed. I guess I just thought he was mad because they were annoying.

So it's probably around 11:30. Everyone is already getting tired and thinking about going to bed. Then houseguest gets a call from his ex. She's an extra large order of infuriating with a heaping side of crazy. Naturally, she sends houseguest into a drunken rage because that's what she's good at. Houseguest takes off outside, presumably to get in his truck, drive drunk to wherever ex wife is, and scream at her until his throat bleeds. My mom goes after him to stop him because drunk driving is bad and also because what good is screaming at a crazy chick gonna do?

Half an hour goes by. They've been outside together for the longest time. My dad urges me to go to bed and he does the same. I can't sleep. I'm worried. I'm going through so many situations in my head, trying to figure out an explanation as to why they've been gone so long. The one that sticks in my head is that maybe they both got in the truck and went to see ex wife. Maybe they got in an accident along the way, maybe they got there and ex called the cops and now my mom and houseguest are in jail. I dunno.

Eventually I work up the courage to go outside and see if they're still there. I step outside and take maybe two steps from the door, and then I hear it. Moaning. Everything turns to ice, panic claws it's way up my throat. Nothing makes sense. And then I did something I wish I could take back. I got my dad.

He was passed out in bed and wasn't happy when I woke him up. I explained what happened, how long they'd been gone and my panicky thought process. I left out the moaning. I was hoping I'd imagined it or that it was a misunderstanding or anything else. I begged my dad to go look for them, make sure they were okay. He did. He caught them. I wish I hadn't sent him out there. I wish he hadn't seen what he saw. 

I don't remember much else about that night or the morning after it. Panic has a funny way of blurring things out. I just know I didn't sleep at all that night and that I couldn't look at my mom for about a week.

Sorry for the novel. I started writing and everything poured out. Like I said at the beginning, it's not nearly as bad as some of these other stories, but it was world shattering for me. Plus, it felt great getting all this out. If you managed to get through it, thanks for reading. "

The only problem is there was a small valley in between two bluffs of white rock, and that whole place just felt wrong. I couldn't stay up there on the bluffs for more than a few minutes. I figured it was just something about being under the open sky or whatever (pretty much all the other land around was wetlands, I was a heavy-forest-cover child). So I went to the valley a lot, tried to pack a lunch one time...nope. Never got used to it. And everybody I took there got creeped out. 

There were cars abandoned there and old fridges, nothing out of the ordinary, just the typical junk people throw in the woods. But one day I climbed up the bluff and saw some nails pounded into the stone, right to the head. There was an anarchy symbol painted nearby, and I think a pentagram. I don't know who put them there or what they were doing but it was nothing good.

Later - almost immediately after, come to think of it - they blew up all the rock, bulldozed the vegetation, and built a gated community. It was like somebody did some kind of ritual and now it was okay for the whole valley to just up and vanish. Obviously this has more of a mundane explanation as to where it went, but still."

8088,"Online in a versus match of Left 4 Dead 2

Edit: Here's the TLDR elaborate story since a couple people asked about it:

Initially played L4D2 on console and in internet cafes with friends irl before it eventually became my gateway game into downloading Steam. I didn't really know anyone who played versus so I resorted to joining random lobbies on my own and ended up joining a game with these two guys who were friends (I'll refer to them as Chris and Moe). We had a really fun match with top tier banter and in the finale I got a wonky death charge in Dead Centre which I guess was a good first impression because in the end they added me as a friend.

Got invited to play with them more and I slowly became a part of their group of friends. It started off innocently at first, whenever we'd all play games together we would be in a group call on Skype and when people would call it a night Chris and I would usually be the last two in the call together so we started talking more. I remember thinking he was really charming and funny and even during that first game we played I remember really liking the sound of his voice. This evolved into having our own side conversations on steam chat while we played and whenever there was big friends versus or confogl matches I'd try to be inconspicuous and get on the same team as him (he later confessed he did the same)

One day I found out Moe and Chris had a conversation where Chris told Moe not to pursue anything with me. Moe has a reputation of catching feels for girls in their group and chasing them off but Chris didn't want the same to happen with me. I jokingly brought up this conversation with Chris and he reacted embarrassingly trying to play it cool. We continued to get closer and closer as ""just friends"" until he finally confessed he had feelings for me. He didn't want to admit it at first because he lives in a different country and had a bad experience with a long distance relationship previously. I told him I had feelings for him too and we started seeing each other exclusively.

After dating for awhile a bunch of shit happened and we broke up. We spoke maybe only two or three times after that which was painful and I ended up ceasing contact with the group all together when we went our separate ways. I was with other guy (Tim) for about two years after this before I realized Tim was toxic and emotionally abusive and finally mustered up the courage to break it off. Around this same time one of the people in that old group reached out to me to see how I was doing. I started playing with that friend again and reconnected with the group and with Chris. At first it was awkward but we became good friends again and he was there for me unconditionally while I processed all my 'Tim' baggage and personal bullshit and I did the same for him with his stuff.

After spending time working on ourselves we started spending more time together and developed feelings for one another again. We discussed at length what went wrong between us and we cautiously decided to see each other. It takes a lot to forgive and learn from mistakes in the past and even though he knows every gory detail about me after everything that's happened he's still around. He still loves me no matter what and we've been together ever since. He's that one great love of my life and I really hope things work out in the end. 

Even now it's funny to think that this all started because of that one random game of L4D2 about 7 years ago. We don't really play anymore, maybe once or twice this past year but we've now moved on to playing Rainbow Six Siege."

He’d leave the house for days at a time, come home drunk and beat everyone within arm’s reach, especially my great-grandmother.

According to my dad (who sad he heard it from a few of the brothers) one day after a particularly violent incident involving a wet rope, the older brothers went out and dug a makeshift grave. They then went into the house, beat the old man out of his drunken stupor, drug him outside and threw him in the hole. They told him that they dug that grave for him, and if he ever laid a hand on another one of the family they’d put a bullet between his eyes and bury him there. They left him there for the night to think it over.

8142,"Exactly.  And that is assuming they even bother to have a judicial hearing, which they rarely do:

&gt;Since 2007, the report found, the DEA has seized more than $4 billion in cash from people suspected of involvement with the drug trade. But 81 percent of those seizures, totaling $3.2 billion, were conducted administratively, meaning no civil or criminal charges were brought against the owners of the cash and no judicial review of the seizures ever occurred.

And to top it all off seized money sometimes generally goes to the law enforcement agencies that took it in the first place.  They literally get to just take people's money or things and you have zero recourse.  It is literal highway robbery, there are police departments in certain areas that focus on pulling over any car possible and searching for cash to keep."

8147,"I had a situation that was quite the opposite to a lot of the stories on here. Met a guy on a dating site that was a single dad to the sweetest little girl. It was very casual and slow and he was very wary of her not seeing us together in intimate/romantic moments at first, which was understandable because he didn't want her to get attached to someone in her life that may or may not be sticking around. He didn't have very much of a close social circle and the mother lived in another country (he had a rocky relationship with her and his daughter was way better off in his custody), so sometimes I would babysit for him on afternoons when he had work commitments or when he needed a night off with the boys just to have the freedom of a social life again. He's an excellent father, and his daughter is so charming and lovely.

To be honest, our dating life fizzled for me because I didn't think we were very compatible, but I still saw them both very often. I think it got to a point where I was spending time with them and persisting in dating him because I adored his daughter so much, and it took me a little while to realise that. It really became awkward and a little wrong and I stopped engaging with him romantically because it felt like I was taking advantage of our relationship to spend time with his daughter more than I was interested in spending time with him. I ended up moving away and we kept in touch casually, and I would still ask how they were both doing. He did remark sadly once that it seemed that I cared more about how she was doing than I cared about him. It was a very awkward situation I never imagined myself ending up in. "

8160,"Was at a pop punk concert with a long ass bill of 4 bands total. Hadnt eaten anything and was starting to feel it but there was a drop of maybe 13-14 year old teenagers in front of me with their dad. Their dad got worried for them about halfway through the show and squeezed through to the front of the crowd to give them quesadillas from the food stand. They took them but weren't hungry and turned around to me, who had been protecting them from the mosh pit the entire time cause they were tiny, and offered them to me. 

Best free quesadillas I've ever recieved"
8161,"I found out that I was at my 18th birthday party. I convinced my parents to let me have a birthday party at the house, we'd never done anything like that before. I had roughly 20 people there, nothing huge. We bbq'd in the backyard, had a delicious cake my mom made, a few of my friends brought guitars and sang my favorite songs. One of them brought in a slideshow of pictures they'd taken of all of us since middle school.

While we were singing and having fun, my mom broke into tears and quietly went upstairs with my dad following. After a few minutes I went up to find them in my room.

The thing you should know about my parents is that they are brilliant, kind, and some of the most motivated people I've ever met. My father is a medical doctor, and my mom is a graduate professor. They've both always been confident and content in their solitude, I think they have less than five friends between them. They fill their time with productive hobbies, my dad does blacksmithing, mom does historical cooking and sewing, both are accomplished woodworkers and master gardeners. Our family vacations were building houses in 3rd world countries and studying pioneer subsistence living. One summer we spent four weeks riding in a covered wagon on the Oregon trail. My dad can fuck anyone up in Quake 3 Arena and my mom has maintained all our cars as long as I can remember. They are the definition of renaissance people. They never fought in front of us kids and always threw themselves into whatever fleeting kid-passions we had. Even back then I thought they were unbelievably cool, especially compared to my friend's parents for whom an exciting night was watching football and drinking until they passed out.

Things weren't perfect though. I didn't do nearly as well as they had in school. I partied, I drank, I smoked weed, I cut class to hang out with my girlfriend, I had sex with my girlfriend. I played video games instead of doing my homework. I tried to get out of 1870s weekends, pretended I hated ren fair, etc.

So I find my parents in my room, sitting on the bed. Mom's crying, dad has his arm around her misty eyed himself. I've never seen them like this. Something flipped in that moment, when they saw me surrounded by people who loved me. Meeting and talking to all my friends was overwhelming for two people who had really only counted each other as close friends their whole lives. They had never imagined that I'd have the kind of life I did. I wasn't cool by high school standards, most of my friends were from robotics club or Warhammer 40k, but my parents didn't care. They finally understood that the time I spent investing in people wasn't wasted, but in fact was just another kind of edification. It wasn't laziness, but a question of priorities. Suddenly instead of being their idiot son who didn't care enough to improve himself, I was the guy they admired in high school who _threw parties_. They were in awe of me and the balanced life I had.

So this is a failing paper, right? We handed it back. I thought it was over. A different student turned in a paper, like a week late. I started grading the paper. I reached the second page, and I had this horrible epiphany. It was the same HORRIBLE paper. I couldn’t compare the two papers, because I didn’t have the original, but it was the same unreadable garbage. I stopped reading, gave the second version a 45, and moved on. THEN an entirely different student, who is not friends with either of the original students turned in a paper. It was like 2 weeks late, but I agreed to grade it. I got like halfway through the first sentence before I realized it was THE SAME GODDAMN HORRIBLE PAPER. I almost died. These were all handwritten, so each student re-wrote by hand all 5 pages of garbage. I know they were all copied, because they had the same weird spelling errors. I have no idea why any of them thought distributing and copying a paper that HAD ALREADY failed. So I had to read the same piece of garbage paper 3 times and it was so unpleasant. "

They are spewing that message out to everyone who knows about their choice: their coworkers, people they do sports with, their friends &amp; relatives... and out of that audience, 2% are hearing ""I'd rather kill than have a kid like YOU"" which is cruelly painful.   
 Another not insignificant % of the audience is hearing ""I'd rather kill than have a kid like your loved one"" which is also hurtful. And an unknown % of the audience is hearing ""I'd rather kill than have a kid like the people you hate"" which validates and encourages prejudiced people.

He apologized for his lateness and told me all about the patient he had just been helping—a 16-year-old girl whose religious zealot of a father had convinced this doctor to lie to her about the results of a pregnancy test. The father had forced this poor girl to take the test upon learning that she was no longer a virgin, and he wanted to scare-shame her even further by having the doctor—who was a minister of sorts in the same church—pretend she was pregnant. She had an emotional breakdown when the doctor falsely told her the test had come back positive, and he said that he used the experience as a ""teaching moment"" to warn her about the dangers of premarital sex. Of course, living where we live (where sex ed doesn't mention safe sex practices), it probably *was* more risky than it could have been.

8322,"Back around '01-'02, my wife and I took a road trip across Northern Arizona. (We'd recently moved to Phoenix, AZ.) No planning, just driving around, exploring, and finding a motel when we were done for the day.

On one particular day, we stopped in a small town straddling the AZ/UT border. Colorado City/Hildale. Very picturesque area, rock formations, etc. and the town looked quaint. 

First I wanted to secure a hotel room. Found a small one, followed the sign to the office...

...and stepped into somebody's living room. Part of a family was watching TV, lady in charge was massive, wearing a ""Little House on the Prairie""-type full traditional dress, and had breathing tubes in her nose from an oxygen tank.

I apologized, pointed to the sign showing this being the office. She looked at us strangely, but set us up with a room. The room was private, thankfully, but a bit small. It had a TV, sans antennae or cable, so it might as well have not been there. 

Clearly, they were fundamentalist Mormons of some type, but we shrugged it off.

My wife and I took a walk around town to work up our appetite. Wearing shorts, holding hands, she's Latina, so we kinda stuck out. It was a strange town. Hardly any people visible. Lots of houses were being built, all of similar patterns. Many were unoccupied, and had no windows on the first floor, which had me scratching my head. A boy passed us on a quad, his head swiveling to watch us. We cut short our walk, and made our way back to the restaurant we saw.

The restaurant was plush, with velvet as a decor motif, a throwback to a past decade. We were the only patrons. A young lady, in a traditional dress of course, seated us, and she seemed to be trying to strike a balance between not being rude, but finding us radioactive. It was disquieting. An older fellow checked on us, a manager I presume, and he was nice. I don't remember the food, so it was probably unremarkable.

We retired to our room that night, and there was no further strangeness. Continuing our trip the next day, we shook our heads at the strange town. It was only later that we heard about the [Warren Jeffs / FLDS controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_City,_Arizona) and realized we'd wandered right into the middle of it.

Confronted the two of them in the basement as we finished putting everything away. Both denied it so we all huddled around and took a closer look...

8407,"My stepmother when growing up was a very abusive, mean and haughty piece of work. Some members of her family were okay, but her mother was the same. Her mother had - for whatever reason, seeing as how he was treated - a special needs kid, a boy who was maybe around 12 when I was 14/15. His mother expressed no interest in him, since she was a selfish addict and he quite possibly had a diagnosis - my best guess being ADHD or aspergers. Or both. Anyway, they treated him like *absolute crap.* Sure, he was annoying as all hell. He would never sit still in any one place for more than a few seconds and he would say wildly inappropriate things, but he was just a kid who deserved love like any other kid. His fostermom would scream at him and forcefully make him sit down to eat. This family definitely had a ""tough love""-policy regarding raising children. 

Despite me feeling sorry for him then and now, he was the single most annoying person of my childhood. He would follow me *everywhere.* Ask me to play with him constantly. Hit me. Scream at me. Cry and lie and tug and pull until I followed him around. And since my stepmother and her mother hated me and loved to annoy the kids in their family, they just laughed it off with a sort of ""oh, he just fancies you""-attitude. You guys have no idea how hellish those years were. So many vacations, outings, afternoons, evenings, spent at my stepmother's family's place and he was **always there.** Ready to pounce. It was even worse because I'm mildly autistic and very sound sensitive and reserved. I've always enjoyed relaxing nearby the adults a lot more than being forced into playing with screaming kids younger than me. 

This kid riddled me with anxiety because his behaviour would embarrass me, he would pull me into his boy-den of filth and drool over my hands (no, literally. He had his head over my hands after he shoved the ps2-controller into them), scream ""let's fuck!"" in front of other people, to their endless amusement (wtf?) and tug, pull, scream, harass...I'm certain some of my tinnitus today is due to his screaming. All this shit ended when I was 16. **16.**

  
TL;DR  
12-year old kid harassed, teased and screamed at me and the adults in my life forced him upon me, even though I repeatedly told them I didn't like being near him."

Some lady offered me a pair of earrings but another patient stage-whispered that she had hepatitis. Everything was awful on top of awful and I was completely overwhelmed. 

There were other things going on in my life at the time and I was so angry and sad and hopeless. I just totally lost it when I got back to my car. 

So I’m sitting there ugly crying when this old black homeless guy raps on my window. I was so startled I didn’t know what to do. I just gaped at him. Since I didn’t roll my window down he leaned closer and shouted, “GIRL! HEY GIRL! WHY YOU CRYIN’?” He was riding a 10 speed and was filthy, filthy. 

I cracked open the window and said, “because I’m sad”. And he shouted in my face,”YOU KNOW GOD, RIGHT? GOD DOESN’T WANT YOU TO BE SAD LIKE THAT! THAT MEANS YOU GIVE UP AND THATS THE ONLY WRONG YOU CAN DO! Don’t give up, girl.” And he gave me this stern look like he meant it. He said, “it’s going to be all right.” Smiled at me and got back on his bike and rode away.

The truth is he didn't really care about her that much. Before his death he was fucking around with and pursuing these two other girls he liked a lot more behind her back. He didn't break up with her because she was very emotionally supportive and their relationship was very convenient for him, but he was not emotionally invested in their relationship at all.

I called AAA, they came with a couple gallons of gas, and we were on our way. We figure better stop as soon as we can to actually fill up, since apparently gas stations are a rare sight around there. I check google maps, and we take the next exit. We pull up to what google seems to think is a gas station, and maybe it was at one point, or is in some alternate reality, but wasn't much of one when we arrived. 

There was a single hand pump for gas, like you see in old photos accompanied with antique fords, but it looked like it hadn't been used in decades. Across from it was a small shack. Being generous, it was maybe 200 square feet. One neon sign was in the window, ""Open."" The door was locked, no one was around, no other cars, nothing.

Just a dog. A golden retriever, no collar, no leash. Just sitting in front of the door to the shack. It seemed fairly interested in what we were doing, but it never moved toward us or anything. 

We hung around for maybe 5 minutes, but we both had a really weird feeling about the place, like reality was wrong there. So, we left and found a real gas station. My brother and I talk about it every once in a while and wonder what was up, but I don't think either of us has a desire to try going back."

8467,"I don't personally have one, but I remember reading a similar thread once a while ago, and the story has remained with me.

A young woman, possibly college student or recent grad, said she was driving home to visit family. It was a fairly decent trek from where she currently lived so when she got tired, she decided to find a hotel or motel room to crash in. 

She ends up finding a dinky little motel in the middle of nowhere. She went into the main lobby and gave her info and got a room. Upon entering the room, she saw it was absolutely disgusting. It had stains everywhere, it was incredibly grimey, and she saw cockroaches.

After seeing the room, she said say fuck it and decided to sleep in the car. She was driving a decent sized SUV with tinted windows. She folded down the back seats and called it a night.

She then woke up a couple hours later and noticed a few men staring into the window of the room she was supposed to be in. I think one of them had a flashlight. Another guy, she recognized as the clerk who got her info and gave her the room, ended up having a key card and opened the door slowly; trying to be as quiet as possible. After the door was fully open, all the men barged in the room.

After a few minutes, saw the group of guys walk out and they appeared to be confused. One of the guys went up to her car and started to look into the windows. He cupped his hands around his face, pressed to the glass, but couldn't see inside with the tints.

They continued talking outside the room for a bit after failing to find her; Most likely trying to figure out where the hell she disappeared to. She heard muffled conversation for a bit and decided she would slowly make her way to the driver seat. She ended up making it, turned tje car on, the engine over, and got the fuck out of dodge as fast as possible.

She was justifiably freaked out and drove straight to her family's place from the motel. When she got there, she ended up calling the local police of the town where the motel was to file a police report. After telling them what happened, the cops let her know that the motel she had stayed had closed down like a week earlier, and was no longer in business.

She presumably escaped a raping, kidnapping, and/or murder."

8488,"Semi fast food. 
In the old folks home I worked in there was a tiny bistro made to look like a replica McDonald's or some shit. There was a 30 item menu and timers because we had to provide it FAST or get a penalty. 

DO NOT EVER ORDER ANYTHING THAT CONTAINS LUNCHMEAT FROM THE PLACE. 

Kevin was convinced food never expired so he just exchanged the labels so they were up to date. 

That bologna and ham is probably 6 months old. The turkey at one point was green slime before he could be convinced to throw it the fuck away. So, SO many people got sick but Kevin was never disciplined. 

This for some reason is very common in old folk home kitchens. Staff will stretch shit as far as they can out of laziness/saving money. So if you find yourself in a homes kitchen looking for some grub DO NOT EAT ANYTHING CONTAINING LUNCH MEAT. "

Interracial marriage is touched on, the decline of the aristocracy's privileges, homosexuality, gender roles, social mobility etc. I think they really handled it well in that show and I thought that many of the characters dealt with the changes realistically.

8512,"During my summers in college, I worked at a summer camp in Maine that has a long-standing tradition known as 12:01. On our nights off, we usually go to a big lake in the middle of nowhere, and at a minute past midnight on the dot everyone strips naked and sprints into the water. Truly, it is an incredible sight to see 50 camp counselors having a big naked splash fight under the light of the moon and the Maine stars.

This period of my life unfortunately had to come to an end, but not without a bang. My last 12:01 ever happened to coincide with the Perseid meteor shower which is INCREDIBLE in Maine – huge fireball shooting stars streaking across the sky every couple minutes or less. So we're in the water splashing around and after a while people start getting out to stand by the fire, but I decide to stay in longer than usual. I just wanted to savor it while I could.

One by one, people climb out of the water until only two people remain. Myself, and a beautiful blonde English girl I had been particularly smitten by all summer. She was so fucking hot and had the sexiest accent, so immediately I was thinking to myself this HAS TO HAPPEN. We're swimming around, kind of play fighting and whatnot when suddenly she straddles me in the water.

I grabbed her ass and pulled her even closer so she could feel the raging erection I had been unsuccessfully trying to subdue, and without missing a beat she took my cock, lined me up and buried it in her incredible English pussy. The lake wasn't too deep where we were and I'm quite tall so the mechanics were surprisingly smooth. Here we are, shitfaced drunk, fucking our brains out in the middle of a lake in the middle of the forest, and then – THEN we both look up.

I could never have imagined stars like this until I actually saw them myself. She looks back down at me, smiles, then slowly eases off me and swims away with a sultry ""c'mon."" Fuck me I could've died. We finally get to a big flat rock about a quarter mile away from the dock and start going right back at it.

I don't even remember how long all this was. I went down on her for what feels like an hour while she laid on the rock, watching the meteor shower and grabbing my hair. Then she flipped me over and started giving me the best blowjob of my life. But it just didn't seem fair, only one of us getting to see the stars.

So finally I pulled her up and flipped her around so we were both looking up at the sky, her slowly sliding down on my dick once again. Fucking DREAM-A-TRON. We had progressed from drunk animalistic pound-town sex to slow jam, Pretty Ricky, I'm-not-fucking-your-dick-I'm-fucking-your-soul sex and at the time, it honestly felt like I was on another planet. At this point, there are shooting stars firing across the sky every 30 seconds or so, she's grinding her ass against me with her head thrown back biting my ear while I'm reaching around rubbing her clit. And then she whispers the words I will never, EVER forget:

""Please cum inside me!""

In that god damn English accent. That was fucking it for me. No I was not wearing a condom and no I did not give a shit about the potential risks. All I knew was that in about 3 seconds I was about to fire one straight through this beautiful girl and I just let it take me over. I look up and right at that instant, the biggest shooting star of the night just DROPS right in front of us just as my head is exploding and body melting from orgasm. Not like across the sky, like it started directly overhead and just dropped straight down to the horizon, reflected in the lake the whole time. And then it was gone, and there was just silence.

We swam back, got into cars and headed home and I went to bed that night with a kind of satisfaction I don't think I have ever felt before or since. I slept better than I ever have. But that was it for us. The next morning, I left to go home to the midwest and she eventually went back to England, never to see each other again. One night of summer passion as fleeting and spectacular as the shooting stars above us, to live on only in our memories."

She had stuffed animal and toys of the characters, she knew the movie by heart, I had hundreds of tea parties with Lilo and Stitch.

My wife and I were telling her about it and she had no memory of having loved them. It was one of the worst moments of my life.

8581,"I have a friend that's in the ""you always gotta aim higher"" camp and I see the same problem with him as I do here. I think the main point is that happiness doesn't always increase the more ""ahead"" you get in your career. 

Let's take the food analogy you brought up. I'm not going to eat scrambled eggs every day because at some point I'm going to get sick of it. At that point I'm going to make something else, that's just as easy, but it will taste a lot better because it's something different. Here I spent the same amount of every as I normally would, however my happiness increased. I could grow my own plants and have them taste better. I could raise animals for food, so I get tasty fresh meet a lot of the times. However, I'm not going to do that because the effort I put in isn't worth it for the tiny increase in happiness.

Same thing with a job. If I'm happy with my current life then there's no reason to take it higher. I'm happy doing what I do for my 9 to 5 and I'm happy when I get to spend the rest of my time doing something I like, like going fishing or watching a good movie. It doesn't matter if I got $5000 or $100000 in my pocket, because it's not going to increase my happiness enough that it's going to be worth it.

I can spend all day working hard, fighting for that promotion to get more responsibility and a bigger check but in the end the effort I've put in and the time I've invested isn't going to equal up to the tiny increase in happiness. What you and my equally minded friend has in common, I think, is that you aren't happy without a status or check that's big enough for you to get to that point where you're generally happy with life.

When I grew up I didn't look up to Bill Gates or the guy that lived in the mansion down the street, I looked up to a father figure. A man that's able to take care of his family and most importantly, is able to handle social interactions is a respectable way, by keeping his emotions under control. When I grow up I don't want to be Bill Gates, I want to be that guy that's able to be a stand up guy for everyone else, no matter the status or size of his wallet.

I think that's part of growing up and becoming an adult. That moment when you realize it's not only about material things, but also about being that regular hero in your everyday life. He's able to work 9 to 5 and do the dishes. He's able to work and find time for his kids at the same time. He's able to enjoy his work and what he does for a living, while also spending time with his kids, while also being a good husband.

Material settling isn't the end of the road and just because someone says ""I'm at my final location. I'm happy here"" doesn't mean that they can't improve as a human. The friend I mentioned before just now landed a pretty big job as a software developer, and he got a pretty big check along with it. However, I have another friend that's working in a factory while taking care of his new wife and kid. I have a ton more respect for the later guy, because he has managed to become emotionally ready for life at such a young age, something that I myself am not ready for in the least. He became an adult and a loving father, capable of raising and shaping another human, while the previous mentioned friend is still working 12 hours a day and picking up chicks at dance clubs.

I guess it's all comes down to where you find your level where you're able to say, ""I'm happy here"", that so many of my role models have in done. If we wanna go deeper on this, you can see this theme of growing up in so many fictional stories. A lot of sitcoms like Friends, HIMYM, Scrubs etc, is going towards the characters settling at the end, and coming to terms that their lives are going to change and maybe become stale, but that it's not a bad thing in the end. Superhero stories is about growing up and taking responsibility, aka, becoming an adult and handling life. Spider-Man/Iron Man/Deadpool/Batman etc, are all stories about growing up. It's about emotional maturity over worldly things like getting more power in the form of a suit or something similar. It's not about what you have, it's about how you use it. Even as far back as the middle ages there were stories about knights, used as a tool to help young people to grow up into stand up citizens.

I'm fine with people thinking differently, but becoming an adult to me isn't about always aiming higher, but managing to be happy with what you have. In the end, the only thing in life that has inherent value is the feeling of happiness. Everything else you have is just a means to get happiness in some sort of way. If you already have that consistent happiness, I don't see a reason to constantly push yourself higher and higher. 

I guess it might just come down to what you find happiness in. I don't think that people with that constantly focuses on material success and push themselves at everything has found it yet, and thus can't understand people that has found it in their current lives, because they themselves wouldn't be satisfied with what the people that settled has."

-snake on nokia (not sure if this is forgotten)

-customizing my Myspace profile. Making a Top 12 and having emo backgrounds. Lol 

-chicken noodle soup for the soul books 

-lastly, this may not be considered forgotten but my friends and I were all about Midnight showings for popular movies; especially HP films. We would get to the theater around 12 noon to watch the movie at midnight. We would bring board games, order food etc. I remember people bringing in lawn chairs, mini tvs etc.

8617,"In the state where I live, a little boy was killed because a car crossed the section of grass between two sides of a highway. As a result, a law or some shit was passed that resulted in ""Kanen's Cables"" - a fence was erected in that grassy strip between sides of the highway so cars could not cross over from one side to the other.

I know someone who works in KDOT, and they told me that what these cables failed to address were all the cars that veered off into the grassy strip, were able to recorrect, and get back on the highway. After all, that's what that grassy strip is there for - so if you lose control, you have more than just the emergency lane to correct and you don't immdiately hit a wall or another car. But because we don't maintain statistics on cars that are able to recorrect and keep moving, it looks like the majority of cars that go into the grass strip end up in a wreck. The person I know in KDOT told me that way more people are able to correct and get out of the grass and avoid a wreck as a result of the grass being there.

Since the erection of the cables, there has been an increase in wrecks and fatalities on our highways (ok, truth be told, I have not done research on this but I took the word of my friend who works for KDOT). A car that would have used the grass to correct and get back on the road, or come to a rolling stop like if they blew a tire, now just hits a big metal fence, and often end up injured."

Met him in 1st grade. Tried befriending him, but he was a dick and never shared playground equipment or anything 

Tried again in 4th grade, still a dick but I stuck it out until the end of fifth grade.

At one point in 5th grade, we almost got in a fight over something during a field trip.

Stopped being friends with him, he proceeds to try and bully me for 2 years straight (mostly verbally, but once physically) but never succeeded because he was terrible at it and people would often tell him to lay off. I could’ve beat his ass if I really wanted but I didn’t care and didn’t want to risk suspension. It didn’t help that he sucked up to teachers and tried being friends with all of them, and did all though Hs.

I also heard stories of people trying to talk to him casually but he was an absolute dick to them too.

Start to not hear from him much during eighth grade. I hear he was bullied, which he kind of put on himself

9th grade comes. He called an anonymous anti-bullying app thing and said someone was going to shoot up the school (this was right after a major school shooting)

Turns out the app lied or something, because they tracked him down. 

School board tries to expel him (finally, he should’ve been expelled before for shit). 
But NOOO he’s such a good kid and there must be a misunderstanding (his parents were very well off and teachers defended him since he was so nice to them, sounds like a lawsuit despite the fact that this is a violation in the code of conduct)
He lucked out with a 10 day suspension unfortunately. I wish he was suspended. 

On the bright side, local news did an atrocious job of censoring his face and even showed his first name after the school shooting thing. He got a lot of shit for it. He kind of deserves it

8714,"You realize all transactions made over $10,000 cash (not bank deposits) require an IRS form 8300 to be filled out and the person you're hiring or buying something for is required to fill your SSN on the form as well. All that stuff has trails too, property purchases get recorded. Tax auditors will absolutely know what you put into it because again, there's records on the value of the fixtures in the old house via homeowners insurance, they will also ask for receipts. If they suspect something they will call up FinCEN I assume, who will start checking with contractors deposits whom you might have paid, starting with the old homeowner to the guy that laid the tile and does the landscaping each week. I assume one of them will have a competent CPA that would have asked you to fill out a form, or at the very least deposited the cash in a bank who filled out a treasury form. 

Again with a used car or boat. Where did that come from and where did the cash come from, well you've got title and registration, tax and insurance on all that stuff. I assume that boat had been used before so someone like game and fish probably has records of the previous owners license for the year if they want to dig in it. Then when you sell all that stuff this happens all over again. How'd you acquire $750k worth of stuff over X amount of time compared to previous income, account for it all and provide records please. 

There's plenty of criminal violations right there with Treasury violations. IRS would probably only have the failure to report income and pay taxes on the initial $750k, but the treasury stuff is where they'd nail you. 

Best thing to do unless you want to just hope you never get audited or tripped up by FinCEN or some other local agency that questions what this guy is doing paying cash for all this stuff, is to check your local laws about reporting lost property as that's mostly a local or state law. Most of them probably have a process, where if after a certain amount of time no one claims the property, you can legally claim it. Then pay your proper taxes and put it legally in your bank account and if treasury asks you've got paper trail that you did everything legally. "

Now as a kid I loved this movie.  It was my go to movie for any time, any where when I was under 10 years old. And even as I got older I’d still throw it on when I was sick or something. 

And then I watched it once as an adult and a lot of questions were raised. Did they really toss milo off a cliff?  How did they train the bear in those scenes? How many cats are in this movie?  Did they really put a cat in a box and send it down the river?  How long did they have to wait for the birth scenes? 

I put it off for awhile but eventually I googled it. The allegations against the producers were that twenty or more cats died and other animals injured the making of the movie. But, the Japanese humane society and the American humane society both investigated and found no cases of cruelty during production. 

So while some outlets allege abuse while some investigations have shown none, either way a lot of the childhood innocence I had with this movie went away. Albeit I still love this movie and will watch it with my son when he’s of movie watching age anyways. Just some scenes will always make me wonder. "

People say big tobacco is a massive funder into vaping, but they are moreso massively funneling money into anti-vaping because they are trying to figure the shit out to make it more mass-marketable.

 I saw an article earlier that was worded extremely negatively towards vaping early.. the wording was ridiculous. It loosely said, and notice the wording:  teens that smoked tobacco had a high amount of cancer-causing chemicals being streamed into their system, but vapers had a higher amount than non-smokers.

Notice how ""but vapers had a higher amount"" was plugged into there, directly following tobacco smoking, to state it was more than a non-smoker. Well no shit, everyone knows it's more than non-smokers. But that article was worded to confuse the general reader on the amount compared to a smoker, because nowhere in there did it mention how it was an insane amount less than tobacco."

8950,"I hate this because there's always this implication that women don't have lizard brains too. When in reality women have just been taught to compartmentalize more and not give any attention or credence to those lizard brain impulses.

I'm a woman and there's always those flashes of lust where I realize someone is a *man* and if I took their pants off thered a be a dick ..and they're standing close to me and suddenly I'm thinking about their body and what it's be like to wrap myself around it and have it pressed up against me and underneath me and my ovaries can practically taste the testosterone coming off them and I just wanna lick their necks...

And then the moment passes and my brain takes note of the head attached to the man body and I remember 'oh shit *it's adam/kevin/josh/Darian/etc. And I remember that I actually don't want to fuck *them*, my body just wants theirs in some kind of bare bones caveman version of lust where society and language and thoughts don't enter in and were driven by hormones and impulse. 

Like...women experience lust too. I don't know when exactly society decided that was an exclusively male sensation. For a large chunk of history women were viewed as the *more* sexual, lustful gender. It's just women aren't taught the same social standards and communication practices around our lust. We are trained to not speak about the lizard thoughts and pretend they don't exist. And we're taught to not take lizard thoughts seriously because most of the time they're the exact opposite of our best interest. 

Lizard brains aren't a male phenomenon. The only difference between men and women sexually that seems to hold up when studied is that the cues are slightly different but the results are the same (men are visual, women are auditory and tactile. Men have a daily sexual cycle where women's is a monthly -or however long her menstrual cycle is). But the sexual response cycle and libido levels don't seem to have any gender differences. There's horny people and not so horny people and people who could hop into bed with a stranger and have a great time and people who can only fuck someone who they're in love with in a monogamous setting. And those come down to differences between people, not differences of gender.

The only real driving cause of sexual differences between men and women is that a lot of women are on hormonal birth control that plummets their sex drive. But it's not fair to have that be the representation of women any more than having the group or men on fluexotine be representative of men."

8955,"Here's something I stumbled across a few months ago. Makes me laugh every time 

~I used to masturbate onto whales at a local dock. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the whales would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some fish. My whales preferred tuna but healthier whales might have a taste for slamon or maybe even sea trout. Fat, unhealthy whales are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the dock and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter fish out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the whales to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your whale. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the whales, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the whale and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those whales reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the world. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a pod of whales, cock throbbing and waiting for them to swim close to me.~

Turns out this was a great investment at the time as David was a somewhat high ranking member in the prison gang, other prison noobs like me were being treated like crap there and I was spared, he told me the other hardened prison gang members were asking about me and he just told them I was his nephew, I was really getting anxious in there because you never really know what these type of guys were thinking about you, after the two weeks I went to court and got off with a stern warning since I was a first time offender, I went back to prison about a week later after my parents had sent me some money, I gave David $120 and a carton of camels since cigarettes are a big deal in jail, I did this so karma wouldn't kick my ass, he was very grateful and gave me a number to contact his grandma and tell her what happened to him and I did that.

I never met David again but he played a very important part in my life at that stage, who knows how things could've turned out for me if i didn't have an influential gang member by my side, jail is no joke for sure dudes were very violent in there."

If I saw a woman telling my ( non-existent) son that he was being annoying I think it'd make me rage.  Then I pictured a man doing it and it didn't bother me as much. I guess it's a societal thing that I can't even help??? Or maybe most of the women I've met in my life who would speak that way to a boy were not the nicest women in the first place?  Idk but I can absolutely understand where you are coming from. I suppose if my son had autism and I knew what the woman was doing it wouldn't bother me as bad but  just the fact that a woman speaking like that to a child bothers me way more than a man kind of makes me feel ashamed

I joined the Navy in 04 and we just happened to be enroute to the middle east when it happened. Instantly turned and went straight there to do humanitarian relief. We personally stayed near Sri Lanka more than Indonesia to help. Dropping off food and water via helicopter, sending medics and personnel, and in my case marking the location of bodies washed out to sea so we could notify the local naval forces to retrieve them since we weren't allowed to do so. 

I remember how crazy it was to be 50 miles away and see floating beds, trees, livestock, and people. There was debris all over even that far out. Left a big impression on 19 year old me.

I like the bring this up whenever I can as a reminder when people bag on the US military saying all we ever do is invade other countries or bully people.

9057,"I have one! I went to a college in small town Missouri and one night around 3am during finals week, a few friends and I got tired of studying, and were looking for adventure. We decided to search for the mythical “train bridge”, which is a small rickety bridge outside of town that went over the train tracks. Trains came through fairly frequently, especially at night, and if you stood at the edge of the bridge and leaned over a bit as a train came through, the air from the train would knock you back a bit. Stupid, I know, but we were young. 

There were no concrete directions to this bridge (at least while I was attending), it was all given through word of mouth, and a friend of mine was confident he could find it, so all 6 of us piled in his car and drove out. Needless to say, my friend didn’t know the directions so well, and we got lost. We turned down at least a dozen dirt roads, knowing the bridge had to be down one, when we came upon something pretty peculiar: a white painted barn wood sign that had definitely seen better days, with the word “CANDY” painted in red with an arrow pointing down the next dark wooded dirt road. 

Obviously, we had to go down. It was a long road, and being so late, we couldn’t see much beyond the trees surrounding us. And then the road just stopped. Written on a tire in white paint was a sign that said “GET OUT” followed by a sign that said “Trespassers will be shot on sight” (tbh, not uncommon in rural MO). We got out to take pictures, when we heard movement and saw light shining through the trees. My friend hurried us back in the car and we attempted to turn around, but the road was narrow and the car was long. We made it out, obviously, but we were super shaken up, and my friend stole the candy sign on our way out. He hung it in his dorm room. We looked, but could never find that place again. We did eventually find the train bridge another night, though. 

Tl;dr: College friends and I got lost and followed a sketchy sign that said “CANDY” pointing down a dirt road into the woods, reached a dead end with ominous signs saying “trespassers shot on sight” and almost got shot on sight. Could never find it again

9063,"So before the days where I owned running gear and was single, I would go out for a run with my apartment door keychain (with keys) around my finger. 

I'm out for a usual run, about 0.1 miles into the run, I see a car pulled over and the driver flagging me down. The lady explains that she's lost and doesn't know where she's going. She's coming from Long Island and is going to Sunnyside.

I tell her, she's about half way there. She's in Queens now, but she's still at the border of Long Island. Queens is a big county and Sunnyside is another 20-30 minutes away with no traffic. I ask her where specifically she's going to and she responds, ""oh, I'm going to a wedding... but I think I'm going to turn around if i have to drive another hour in traffic.""

No problem by me. I redirect her back to the highway since she seems directionally challenged. I take off for my run. Another 0.1 miles from the bitch, I notice my keys are missing. Fuck! I have my cell phone but no way to get into my apartment! 

I retrace my steps. Can't find them. I get back to the lady in the car, her window rolled up, she hasn't left yet. Ok... maybe I dropped the keys in her car? I ask her to roll the window down and I ask her if she's seen my keys. She rolls her eyes, says no, rolls the window up and drives off... 

I was so pissed. I spent literally 10 minutes helping this sack of shit, giving her routes how to get to where she was going and she couldn't even give me an ""oh, open the door and check if you dropped them..."" Nope, just gone.

I ended up finding the keys right where I helped her. And if anyone asks me for directions, I still help as best as I can. But I'll never forget the shitty person who could not be bothered to answer a simple request.

I'm pretty sure no one missed her at the wedding."

9071,"A few years ago around the holidays I was having some trouble sleeping and I was prescribed an antidepressant to take in the morning, and Ambien to take at night. So the first morning I'm up around 3am for work, pretty sleep deprived, and I pop a pill. Then I look...it's the Ambien. I panicked. I tried to make myself throw up. I took a cold shower. I had never taken them before so I had no idea what was going to happen. But I was the opening manager, the only one with a key, and I had to be there at 5am to let the employees in. So I went to work. It was a weird day. If you take Ambien and don't go to sleep it feels really, really weird, like being in a daze and slightly unsure if you're actually awake. Luckily the majority of my shift was before the store was ever even open with minimal employees. "

9149,"This has already saved me from a late bill and I've only had it for 5 months. Saw my water bill come in on my email, but the mailman didn't get it in the box (a month later and he still hasn't). Called for the bill info and paid before it was due. What I don't like about this feature is that the email says to wait a week if you don't see the missing item, but if you then click the link for a missing item, you'll get an error message saying that they only hold the info for 7 days. So, good luck with that I guess. "
9150,"I remember I was out the front of my school playing and a man said he worked with my dad and that my mum told him to pick me up cause my dad was in the hospital I started to walk with him and he took me around the corner where his mustard coloured holden kindswood was sitting with the engine running and about 50m before the car I was dragged off my feet I couldn't see who had me and I couldn't get free

Then I heard this ear breaking scream and I just saw the guy let go of my hand and run for his car. I was so confused and I still couldn't break free or see who was holding me and they were dragging me away it was only that i saw my mums car that i realised the person bear hugging me was my mum.

I got in the car and she didn't say anything, but when I got home she hit me like 10 times with a wooden spoon and told me if i ever walk with someone i don't know again it would be 100.

I often wonder what would have happened to me if my mum hadn't seen me at the bottom of the hill just before i turned the corner. the sucky thing is my mum died a few years later so i could never talk to her about it as an adult."
9151,Peaches. This is about as good as they'll get this season. Can't wait for another peach season next summer!
9152,"Could be drug-induced punding?

9153,"Actually, pretty much. Being able to discsrd things without concern for your ability to replace them is a trsdemark of relative financial security."
9154,She changed her mind about not wanting kids and that's not something you can compromise on.
9155,"Hmm, I kind of dig it."
9156,"When I was little my dad worked in construction. Sometimes if he was repairing a house with a family, I would go with him and just hang out.

On one particular occasion, I was with my dad at work and at the house there was this little boy who was about my age. We we're watching cartoons, but the kid kept trying to close and lock the door on us. Every time I'd try and go for the door he would block it from me. We were really young and I had no idea why he was acting so strange. My memory is a tad fuzzy but I think he tried to push me on the couch and kiss me. I was a bit of a tomboy growing up, even from a young age so it was pretty easy to push him off as soon as I got the chance. Eventually I got around him and stayed close to my dad the rest of the day.

I don't know why I didn't say anything, maybe I was worried I would get in trouble for pushing that kid down, but looking back on his behavior, something weird  might have been going on ... This was over 20 years ago, so I'll never know."
9157,"I had a female teacher in fourth grade who would threaten to touch the boy students with her ""cold fingers"" as punishment. If I didn't do my homework she would put her hands down my shirt and feel around. If I got a question wrong same thing. I was quiet and hid in the back of the room and never raised my hand and she seemed to target me more than other students, so I decided I wanted to get out of the class. 

It was the gifted math glass, so if I just failed it I knew they would drop me a level. So I failed every test, went from having like a 95% average to a 42%. They dropped me to the lower math level and I ended up scoring perfect scores and sleeping thru class because I learned it all already. This raised red flags so the principal had a sit down with me and my parents. I told my principal about her behavior and she just laughed and basically told me to deal with it. They put me back in the advanced math class and I cried and begged her not to but she didn't listen.

When I get back to the upper level math class this teacher just becomes relentless. She was told by the principal to ease up on me a bit but she didn't listen. Literally the first day I came back she brought a bucket of ice, dipped her hands in it and started asking me questions about content I missed due to being in the other class. Then she took her cold hands and just massaged my back down to my ass almost. I started crying, all the other kids in the class were laughing. She never got in trouble for it, I'm pretty sure she still teached when I graduated, but if that was a guy doing that to female students there's no way he wouldn't have gotten fired."
9158,Damn... that's just horrible
9159,The people who worked at the place where I went skydiving all said straight up that they wouldn't have anything to do with bungee jumping. These are people who jump out of planes for a living.

9163,"Exactly!!! I love my man to death but sometimes i feel so silly like ""come on baby, cum for me, i love you so much"" in my head im just begging him to finish. Ahhh men. Plus no matter what he drinks or how many times he brushes his teeth, he oozes this specific liqoured smell that i detest. "
9164,"Tried to enter through the backdoor with my wife and the only warning I gave was asking if I could try something. She raised up, looked at me and then punched me in the stomach as hard as she could and I fell of the bed. She said we're done here and to go sleep in the other bedroom with the dog who looked at me like I was a fucking moron."

9186,"It was the first major conflict in which mechanized warfare *completely* took over.

9187,"Mine is ""never have I ever worn women's underwear"".

9202,"I knew that... because of all the pussies I have eaten and other stuff I have done with many, many girls who were greatly satisfied "
9203,"Also these days being late is a personality trait you can't call out anymore. It's just ""that's how I am, sorry,"" and if you have a problem with it, your late friend doesn't give a shit and doesn't try to do better. Being late is a 100% socially acceptable way to be rude AF. "

9213,"Somewhat related to this, but apparently when I was 4 years old I had this tactic I used on my dad whenever he was punishing me for stuff where I would tell him, ""Me dijiste Gonzo"" which basically translates to ""You called me Gonzo."" I don't know how I came up with that, I did like the Muppets and Gonzo was my favorite, but whenever I said that my dad was unable to hold back his laughter and he would go a lot easier on me."
9214,I use to get dropped off at my friend's house and the last thing my parents would tell his parents was beat him like he's your own. But I was alright I stayed out of trouble.

9217,"Minecraft. Actually, scratch that. The game is still amazing. The new updates are amazing. The people I play with are amazing. The stigma is the worst part. It turned from ""oh, you play this obscure game, sounds intriguing, bet it's pretty fun"" to ""Wait, you play that game my obnoxious 9 year old nephew won't shut up about, and has every merch ever for with pixellated plushies that look like piles of garbage?""

They used to judge the game as good based on liking me and my tastes and knowing I play it, but now they assume it's awful and judge me for playing it."
9218,Constantly having her phone in her hand. I couldn't remember a moment when she didn't have her phone in her hand. Texting and driving. Texting and checking special media pages while at dinner. There wasn't a single moment that we had that didn't have to be documented for others to see.

9233,"As a teen, I had absorbed my parents' bootstrappy politics - that success comes from hard work and diligence, and if you're not successful you aren't working hard enough or being diligent enough.

As an adult, I've come to realize that all my success is due to good luck, not hard work or diligence.  Plenty of people are just as hard-working and diligent as I am, if not more, but are still struggling because they haven't had the same good luck."

9266,Makes me wonder how much of whats in that bag is actually cheese.
9267,"Seriously!! Ordering random women to smile just makes these guys look like they view us as sexy drones with no real autonomy or personality. It says, ""Your personal emotions aren't helping me leer at your good looks. Fix that!""

Even if it's not coming from a creepy place, it's still super rude and ignorant. The women being told ""Smile!"" could very well be depressed, overworked, sleepy from studying all day, mourning a relative/friend/pet, sick with a cold, nauseated from food poisoning, stressed by a suddenly high utility bill, frazzled with a petty legal squabble with a neighbor......

9268,"I like the Prime Directive theory cause it’s a bit more optimistic. I’m sure it’s called something else but I watch a lot of Star Trek. 

It’s basically the number one rule (in Star Trek) that members of Starfleet wait until the aliens can achieve faster than light travel before initiating contact so they don’t interfere with their natural progression as a species. 

So maybe the aliens are just waiting until we are a more stable and productive species. I mean honestly I wouldn’t want to visit Earth if I were an alien from a super advanced futuristic world. We are probably wild animals to them lol"

The opening showed a chat session where a developer asks him to test his code for security flaws and sends links to both the website and the SourceForge repository. The hacker then runs a bunch of standard search and filter tools on the code and after a few minutes finds a flaw that gives him access to usernames and some user information which he then demonstrates by running it against the main site.

I didn’t forgive and include him in our family because I am super nice or a martyr, or better than people who don’t forgive. I had a great opportunity to forgive because I have a rare case where the person who betrayed me, fully takes responsibility for what he did, is kind and cooperative with my husband, seeks to be a good father, and doesn’t try to skate away from the consequences of his actions. I wouldn’t forgive and have peace if he were still blaming me, or fighting with me about the kids, or any of the other shitty things that so many ex-spouses do. "

And I am absolutely not a subscriber to the nice guy should always end up with his love interest in the end, because it always feels super gross and manipulative, but Aang always loved Katara in the true airbender fashion, freely. He just wanted her to be happy, was even in the end willing to let go of her in his mission to control the avatar state. And yea, Zutara is fun, but Zuko and May are the best ❤"

One year later my dad and I travel again through the same small town on another road trip in the area. We start wondering if we'll see the old guy again and as a matter of fact, we do. We chat and it seems he doesn't quite remember our first meeting (a fellow produce seller nearby mentions that he himself does), but this old man just lights up after I show him our photo together from the previous year. We take another photo together, wish him well, and leave. Probably to never return. Still one of my favorite travel experiences. "

It was a level 200 class so there were a few sophmores and juniors. The way how it worked was that at the beginning of the semester our professor had assigned us to groups of 6. During the peer review sessions she would staple the papers together according to group number and give it to different groups so we wouldn't grade our own group's papers. 

Around midterms we had to write a mock proposal for a scientific field of our choice, had to be at least 6 pages long with headings, abstracts, materials, hypothesis etc.. The one who wrote the best proposal got a Dunkin Donuts gift card.

I found one of the junior's proposals and ohhhh my God. She only wrote two pages, had no discernible format, used a typewriter font, had no headings, and it was just her blabbering on about how herbal medicine helped her mental illness. There wasn't any real conclusion because from what I could tell she *didn't even have a hypothesis*. There was so much wrong with the paper that I just moved on without writing anything.

The real kicker is that she always promoted her self-published book on our class discussion board.

Every time something bad happens to her she blames others instead of reaching out for help or communicating her concerns to others. When people warn her not to do things she ignores them.

She tries her hardest to make them feel bad and get people in trouble after the fact instead of dealing with the issues head on or at least while she’s alive.

I still remember the scratches on his face that were too deep to cover for his viewing. I really need to go to therapy for this. It’s been nearly 20 years, but after finally putting down the bottle I’m starting to really FEEL the trauma from that day. I flashback to that moment all the time, I have to grind my teeth and hold back the tears and force myself to think of something else. Mostly I grieve for my mom though. We both watched it happen and that day we became aware of real pain, so much fucking pain. I just wish he had died of sickness or something. "
9426,"""Your math was incorrect but you still got the right answer."""
9427,"I was just reading a post about this in /r/eli5  and one thing I never considered in this scenario (I was planning on waiting for something like this too) is that banks won't have the money to initiate loans in a crash like this and even if they do there is no certainty that your job will still be there. 

To better explain, I'll copy /u/JudgeHoltman's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/96zlk8/eli5_people_say_that_the_housing_market_has/e44hb10/) below:
&gt;So, you want to buy a house. In the 70's/80's, this was a big deal, because you had to have excellent credit to score a sweet 15% interest rate. If you default, you lose your house, which means you generally become a social outcast so you lose your friends and family too.

&gt;That made the loans very stable. Folks would default on everything else in life before missing a house payment. Eventually, banks start lowering the interest rate because it's such a safe investment for them.

&gt;The only problem is that when a bank writes a mortgage, they don't have that money back to write more mortgages for another 15-30 years. To fix that, they will sell your mortgage to bigger bank.

&gt;Say they loan you $100k today. In 30 years they'll make $200k after interest and payments. But they won't have their original $100k back for 15 years. Same goes for the other 10 people that took out mortgages this week. So, they bundle it all together, and sell that debt package (worth 10x $200k) to a bigger bank for $1.05m, netting them a quick $50k profit.

&gt;The big bank that bought it will eventually collect the $2m in debt they just bought over time.

&gt;Ooooor they could bundle it with a bunch of other packages and sell THAT package for cash today, netting themselves a quick profit, and transferring your debt to an even bigger bank.

&gt;Eventually the piles of loans get so big, it's tough to determine how credit worthy the debtors are still. Every once in awhile, someone defaults, and that debt package becomes a little less valuable. So, you buy insurance. If a single loan defaults, the insurance company pays the difference in exchange for a flat rate.

&gt;Basically, the bank is gambling that more people will default this year, and the insurance company bets that their premiums will make more money than they pay out in defaulted mortgages.

&gt;And know what? The insurance company has insurance too. Bets on bets on bets.

&gt;Honestly, this is all great. Keeps the economy well funded, interest rates stay low, and everyone can have what they need to grow TODAY instead of having to wait and save.

&gt;Just one thing, it all depends on EVERYONE paying their mortgage on time.

&gt;Problem is that the low level bankers are conditioned to think in short term exclusively. Their profit incentive is to write as many loans as possible, because whatever they write will be packaged up and sold within the week. They'll make their quick $5k, and if you can't pay after that it's not their problem.

&gt;So now you see strippers qualifying for 3 $500k homes because their income looks fucking fantastic TODAY, and nobody's asking how they're going to make their payments in 30 years. McDonalds workers are finally able to buy houses for their whole families because interest rates are so low.

&gt;When they default, the big banks that bought the loans don't care because they just kick the folks out and file the loan insurance claim.

&gt;But then 2008 happened. The insurance companies ran out of cash to pay the claims and file for bankruptcy. Suddenly the banks have to deal with the steaming pile of shit that are these loan packages.

&gt;They start to run out of cash, because folks aren't paying their mortgages. The street level lenders can't write more loans because they're out of cash to give, and can't offload last week's take.

&gt;Now the banks own all these abandoned and foreclosed houses. Normally they'd sell at half price, but since the entire neighborhood looks like foreclosed houses, they're lucky to get 20% of the purchase value.

&gt;Also, nobody's buying because they can't get loans, because street level lenders are tapped.

&gt;This means construction stops. Those that sell parts of houses shut down, the entire lending industry has a lobotomy. The whole economy just stops because nobody can spend money."

9458,"&gt; Changing the name french fries to freedom fries, on the other hand, will just make them laugh at you.

Can confirm. Source: I'm French.

French fries are not even called French fries in French and we generally think they come from Belgium and we associate them with the US (burger, fries and coke being the main menu in fast food restaurants most of which came from the US). Also, they're really not important in France as a food (they're in fast foods of course but apart from that, many people don't eat them regularly), so seeing the Americans trying to offend us by changing their name was just completely outlandish and childish.

And the main satirical show in France at the time (Les Guignols de l'info) had a field day painting [Bush as a complete moron and his administration as a greedy company ready to destroy the world for their profits.](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2vcxjy) Yes, in the video and in that show in general, every single advisor of Bush is Sylvester Stallone and the Bush administration was actually depicted as a greedy corporation called ""the world company"""

9460,"For me, it is [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McUwVg6MfOk) from Return of the Jedi.

When Darth Vader strolled onto the screen in 1977, he was the ultimate villain.  A ruthless, murderous force of nature that was pure evil.

In Empire, he took on a whole new level of evil.  Choking anyone who got in his way.  Torturing our heroes.  Then there was that big reveal...

When Return of the Jedi came out, we'd been building up to the finale for six years.  Luke was finally strong enough to stand toe to toe with Vader.  To finally win.

And then...this scene.  Within just a scant two minutes of screen time, everything changed.  The epic villain became a sad old man.  Pity and pathos took over, and the most brilliant thing that ever happened...happened.  You actually felt sorry for Darth fucking Vader.  And then he smiles. 

Sebastian Shaw played the scene perfectly.  Even Hamill's hammy acting couldn't ruin it.

That's my answer."

As we were eating and talking, he tells us to look up. He had painted a mural of the desert on the ceiling. As the clerk, my dad, mom, uncle, brother, and I were studying it quietly while chewing our food, some lady walks in, pauses and stares at us for a second or two, and then bolts out for absolutely no reason.

9590,"When I was about 9-10ish, I was living in a small town. Less than 1000 people. I had a crush on the neighbor kid’s babysitter, she was maybe 13-14. I liked her because she always treated me like I was an equal and not some dumb kid. 
She would always tell me about all of the small town gossip going on that I had no idea about because, y’know I’m fucking 10. 

One day she biked over to my house and told me about how some woman froze to death on their front step the night before.     
 So now I have this crazy story and nobody to share it with. Conveniently that night my parents spontaneously had a handful of friends over for drinks and I thought “oh now is my chance to be cool and hang with adults because I have this wild tale”. 

I walk up to the room full of grown ups and say “Hey guys, did you all hear about the woman who froze to death on her step last night?!” Everything went absolutely silent. After an eternity, one guy sheepishly says “Yeah....that was my mom.” 
 
Turns out this spontaneous gathering was to mourn the loss of this man’s mother.  I do not remember anything that happened after that because my mind blocked it out. I only remembered this happened because I overheard my mother talking on the phone about some woman freezing to death, and I was so baked it unlocked this repressed memory. 

tl;dr: I tried to gossip about a person’s death to their own son, repressed it, and then weed was like “hey remember that time?”"

9609,"My Grandfather was a Royal Navy Reservist at the outbreak of WW1. He quickly joined the Royal Naval Division (Navy Infantry, distinct from Royal Marines). He fought at Antwerp, Gallipoli, Ancre and Paschendale where he was gassed. He was awarded the Military Medal for valour somewhere along the way and never told anyone why - other than to joke that it was for being first at the cookhouse door. He liked the Germans, respected the Turks, but didn't like the French. Disturbing nigtmares were a feature all his life after the war and he talked in his sleep. This was often random stuff but occasionally lucid enough to hear him once issue an order to fix bayonets. When WW2 came along he tried to sign up again, but was directed to the Home Guard. As a result of this he had a Bren Gun which he kept in the attic. He forgot all about it and handed it in to the Police in 1949."

9632,"I am a Buddhist and I have personal evidence of the continuance of existence after death. In Buddhism there is neither a body nor a soul that continues (eternalism): this is the doctrine of *anatta*. What continues is more subtle. However, suffice to say that death is not the end of existence.

I had not talked to my father for 18 years as he was a bipolar sufferer who self-medicated with alcohol and drugs and, in his rage and hatred, was sexually and physically abusive. My mother finally agreed to kick him out of the house and he moved into cheap accommodation (rented to him by the owner of the local corner shop where he'd bought his cheap booze for so many years). His eldest son, my half-brother, moved in to. My father killed him in an argument. Therefore I had not talked to my father since I was 18.

In February 2017 I had two nights of vivid dreams where my father came and apologised to me. I felt great joy and peace alongside my forgiveness of how he'd personally treated me. This was in marked contrast to the nightmares about him I'd suffered sporadically before then.

In October a solicitor got in touch to say that he'd died, alone and still in the grip of his addictions, in February. It took them a while to find us as me, my mother and my three siblings had all moved so they had to look for us (which was intentional). Those dreams could well have been a coincidence, but they were too emotionally important for that to be a satisfying answer."
9633,"Used to work at a very popular Canadian chain restaurant. Saw the owner a couple times without knowing she was the owner. Wasn't until 6 months into working there that she actually introduced herself. Within the next 30 minutes she yelled at me multiple times for my work performance/uniform, both directly in front of customers and in the back (where everyone upfront can easily hear everything anyways). She was bitching me out for things by telling me what she disliked but never mentioning how they could or should be improved. Keep in mind that I was working and doing everything the exact same as I had been doing for the past 6 months, and not once had any of the managers or supervisors called me out for anything. I quit a couple days later. I was only 16 but old enough to realized that if that is how dysfunctional a company is I wasnt sticking around to be a part of it."

9655,"&gt; Add butter. No, more butter.

Same thing with garlic. More garlic than you think is really acceptable as an amount of garlic.

For comparison on personal pizzas, just a single 6"" personal pizza, you can totally put around half a head of garlic (1-2 cloves per slice) and it's totally fine. Compare to a whole pot of stew, roughly the same ratio would put you over a head, head and a half of garlic. 

Same thing with garlic toast, when you make that, it should be about 50/50 butter and garlic, then some parmesan mixed in. And make sure it's not shitty white bread that is more like pillow lint than actual bread.

9695,"I did a cruise as a trainee crew hand when I was 18. It was a three mast new ""old"" Brig Rigged Ship. (Early 1900 vessels made to look like old time frigates, only with metal hull).

  


One night we hit a really bad freak storm and I was the one of the only crew hand totally comfortable with climbing high in the masts. So they come and wake me up at 3 in the morning (not my shift), give me a cup of tea (bloody brits, you wake someone with coffe, not tea) to send the third mate, a girl and me climb up the mast to bring the Royal and Topgallant down.

  


The sea was the second worst I've ever seen for the Mediterranean, there's around 45 to 50 knots of wind, we are of course secured with two lifelines, but the movements of the ship make us not climb the mast but run almost horizontally for four of five seconds and then hold on for our or lives for the next ten seconds while the vessel goes the other way. The higher we go, obviously the more important the movement is. Take us like 20 minutes to climb the 40 or 50 meters of the mast, half an hour to fold each sail since the girl with me is not quite strong enough ( not weak she was quite strong for a 18 y/o teen, but folding a sail soaked by the rain, on a roller coaster, and one handed cause the other one is holding you is really hard).

  


We finally do the Topgallant, then the royal, and then the third mate pulls us up in the ""eagle nest"" (literal translation from French, no idea if it's actually a thing in English), offers us a couple of cigarettes, pulls out a wiskee flask , and we stay up there, battered by the rain, the sea making a frigging rollercoaster, for half an hour watching the little light of the sun rising trough the heavy clouds and storm.

  


I was completely exhausted but have never felt so alive.

Edit: at night during heavy weather there is literally no light. You can barely see the position lights from the ship, the only thing giving you light is a torch strapped to you life jacket that is a hitch to aim at something you need to see, and maybe one on your head if you don't loose it, with the wind, hanging your head on whatever, rain, ship rolling, ect.

Kili gets a little closure because of the love triangle, Thorin gets his last words with Bilbo, but Fili? Nope, his last appearance is being stabbed that thrown off a rock.

* My identical twin sister and I were the product of child molestation
* pretty bad abuse growing up
* grew up in severe poverty; no dad
* dropped out of high school
* hospitalized as a teen for bipolar disorder
* lived in the foster system for a little bit
* had to get a pacemaker for a serious heart condition when I was 15 and in foster care. My sister needed one too.
* lost my only parent, my mom, when I was 24 and she was 47 to a brutal fight with cancer in 2016

But believe it or not, all of that made me so much stronger. I literally feel like I have the best life in the world. Super average. I just got married to my wife and we do boring adolescents things together. I mean we also travel and party but all of the ""bad luck"" that would have ruined my life actually made it so I can enjoy this sweetness that is a stable, average life.

9775,"I used to think my parents were lame and awkward to be around, and that they were too strict and overbearing.  There was a time when I resented them.  When I met my wife (then-girlfriend), I thought she had the better parents.  There was a significant period of time where I pretty much avoided my own family and spent way more time with hers (especially around the holidays).

Then I watched as her parents flushed their marriage down the toilet (it was mainly mutual stubbornness and stupidity) and nuked every last cent they had ever saved to spite each other (even lost their house to the county because they refused to cooperate on signing paperwork to auction it off and neither of them was paying the property taxes).  They may have been the ""fun"", ""cool"" parents, but when it came to making sound decisions, it turned out they both sucked at life.  Now my wife and I are guaranteed to be on the hook for keeping both of them afloat.  They're both broke and working part-time jobs, and my sister-in-law and her husband lack the resources to help them - so my wife and I are going to be stuck paying their bills soon enough.

Now, I realize I had it pretty good, and while teenage/college me thought my own parents were lame, awkward, and strict, I realize now that they're pretty great, they prepared me pretty well for life, and that they're actually pretty cool to hang out with (even if they don't appreciate all the same sorts of things I do).  My parents aren't rich, but they don't make stupid decisions with their money, and I know I can always count on them to be there for us - that they aren't going to flake out when we need help (even if its not financial help).  I really regret the years I spent avoiding home, because I'll never get those years back."

That spot was not all the way on their property nor all the way on my mom's, but it was a 70/30 split in my mother's favor.

So what does the neighbor do? Surely she sees this parked car and shrugs it off, thinking her son will just have to park somewhere else. No. She calls the cops. Because my mom parked in her son's spot.

It's nearly midnight and my mom has to go outside in her robe and jammies to stare at this lady telling her it's her son's spot.

There is no definition on what high functioning and low functioning is so everyone corals all these different people on the spectrum into two gradients that don't reflect their specific behaviors.

I'm high functioning according to the general consensus, so they think I can take on mostly anything, but when people end up overwhelming me with things I am not comfortable doing, they proceed to label my behavior lower on the spectrum. 

This is not how we should be doing things.

I think we should again shift to a new categorization of the spectrum, instead of a line, we should have a compass of different behaviors, which could give a more accurate understanding on individuals on the spectrum.

The logic of humanity fails upon entering the glistening, painstakingly cleaned (but never so clean as to avoid a child sneezing all over them) glass-paned doors of any retail establishment. Once inside, the human mind loses it's 4th and 17th gear that keeps logic running intact, and instead replaces those gears with an incorrect grapefruit.

Thus, the mind continues to run in all the wrong patterns. The ailment will continue so long as the subject is within a 1 mile radius of said retail establishment, and will recover in time.

Notably, the human cogs known as 'em-ploy-ees' somehow manage far better than the short-term 'customers.' However, the impact of lost brain cells seems to weigh greatly upon the employee even some hours or days after encountering another subject's failure."

His brilliant idea was to get me pregnant, I was 16 at the time, and then he'd raise it with my mom as theirs. Eww, no. 

There were a few other things that he said and did on top of that little gem that led my mom to break up with him but he refused to believe that the relationship was over. One day my mom and I were coming home from visiting family and noticed his motorcycle in front of our house. My mom didn't want to get into it with him so we parked around the corner and I snuck into our house through the kitchen window and unlocked the back door for my mom because we didn't have a key for that door. He stayed outside our house all night and slept on the porch. Thankfully he was gone the next morning though. I don't remember dealing with him much after that.

She jumped up to grab the doorknob and opened my son's bedroom door to walk over to where he was staring at a puzzle rather than napping.  She approached him and nudged his hand before sitting down.  My then-2 year old son looked at her before nodding.  As he stood up and started to walk out of his room and head downstairs, the cat raced out of the room to fetch our other cat.  They escorted my toddler down the stairs and followed him to the kitchen.

As my son stared at the counter, Cat 1 went and stood by a kitchen chair.  When my son turned to look at her, he laughed and pushed the chair to the counter, climbed it, and retrieved the box of cat treats from the cupboard.  The two cats made little yipping noises of encouragement as he worked.  Finally, using the power of thumbs, he defeated the packaging and rained cat treats down on the kitchen.

I stepped in after the second handful.

Two hours later, they repeated this process as soon as I left the room to use the toilet.  The cat encouragement noises were a dead giveaway.

But yeah, I was impressed they could open doorknobs, convey a message to a toddler, and knew to wait until I left the room to repeat it."

I agree with a lot of what you said, but AdNauseam does something I don't know how to do otherwise.

There exists a very accurate model of ""me"" in many advertisers databases. I deeply DEEPLY oppose this. Quite frankly I have no desire for advertisers to have such complete models of my likes/dislikes/life.

I block ads, I block tracking, many websites I disable javascript for all together. I use anti-fingerprinting extensions for my browser, I deny cookies when possible... Still every so often I load up without my adblocker just so I can see what ads I get (I also have to disable my DNS blocker for this to work).

Ya know what? They know Im getting married, they know what games I like, they know what hobbies I've picked up recently. All that work and they still got a very VERY accurate profile.

Then I installed AdNauseam. Took about 3 weeks, but next time I checked and the ads were NOTHING like me. They were just seemingly random.

Now I accept that AdNauseam hurts sites, hurts businesses, and we can just disagree that it hurts consumers, but until the ad industry lets me opt out of their profile building and agrees to just serve me random ads without trying to figure out who I am and what I want (short of paying attention to what the content the ad is placed next to is), I will continue to run AdNauseam, and others really should too.

9994,"So noone who reads this will have read this book, but I need to rant about it. 

It's a Dutch book that I read in high school called ""En knielde voor hem neer"". The book seemed interesting and looked very new so I thought it was very recently published. Only after finishing the book did I see it was actually 8 years old. The reason it looked so new was because it had only been taken out of the library 4 times! 

I could rant for hours about how awful this book is, but I will just describe the worst part. So one of the side characters is gay and quite offensively written, but that's not the problem. Every week this character has dinner at his professor's house, where the professor rapes him. This is revealed in almost the exact same way in the book as I wrote it just now. Just one sentence and then the story just moves along. 

Eventually the main character asks this character why he keeps going back to the professors house (very valid question!). And his reason is honest to god because he thinks the professor needs to see the error of his ways by himself. Like I need to believe a rape victim would keep volunteeringly getting raped (is that a contradiction?) just so their rapist can learn a fucking moral lesson?!

It’s been well over an hour of reading, I don’t know why, but something about this thread really struck me. It reminds me off my own experiences, own people, (ones I care about and stayed connected with). I’m sitting here at 2:30am where I am, (Ontario, Canada), writing this, and feeling heartache. Tearing me apart.

You know what? This is a thread, about experiences with strangers, so I’m just going to share it, my life. 

My life was never a good one. I have social anxiety, major depression, do self harm, and have attempted suicide twice in the past. My wrists are layered with scars and cuts, some cuts are not faded, four as of this moment. I was bullied intensively for over four years, the main cause of all this. I graduated elementary school in 2017, and finished my grade nine year just over a month ago. High school is better. This year in high school, I met someone, someone who really cared about me, I realized, maybe I did have something to live for after all. Thank you Katelyn. 

Then, just two weeks ago, I went to a summer camp by the name of Kintail, and I met some people. Some wonderful, beautiful people. People like me. I know I’m not alone now, I’ve never felt so... I don’t know, my emotions are all wrong. I don’t know what I feel, but at least I’m capable of feeling now. But anyway, I met some people like me, I’m not alone anymore. Lexi’, Mel’, Shadow, Natalie. Thank you for being my shoulders to cry on. It’s not like I’ve lost them. I stayed in contact, but they live away hours from where I do, I can’t be with them in person. And it breaks my heart, each and every day. 

Everyone’s asleep now, at this very moment I have no one to speak with. No one at all. 

And so I sit here, under a dark sky, feeling connected, but alone. Heartbroken, but loved. Sadness, but joy. Empty, but fulfilled. Walking a fine line between life and death. Which way do the scales lean? For now, I abide. 

I don’t know if you will even read this whole thing. I don’t know if anyone ever will. I’m 14 now, a short span for many unimaginable sorrows. But now, a shot in the dark, a one in a trillion chance. If someone knows me, and sees this. Tell me. 

 For now, I abide. 

Aidan.

10027,"I saw Meshuggah in Birmingham UK last year and one guy between songs had the light of his phone on and was looking for something he dropped. He shouted ""has anyone seen my watch?"" when it was quiet. 

During the next song, I was having a break from the mosh pit and felt something under my shoe, and it was a watch. I bounced back through the pit trying to find this guy, and when I did find him he pushed me back into the pit at first because I guess he thought I was just being clumsy. The second time, I held the watch in front of him, gave him a thumbs up, smiled at his *gobsmacked* face, and went back into the depths of the pit. 

I felt good the rest of the night. "

10046,"So this is a story from my dad. He spent 14 years in the US Navy serving aboard Nuclear Fast Attack submarines. This story is more unsettling that it is creepy. He and his boat where deployed into the north sea and about a week into their voyage one of the senior enlisted crew members died of a heart attack. Well submarine have very tight operational security, which means once they go under the water they won't come up unless it's an emergency or they reach a US Naval Base. So when this guy died only a week into their operation they only had done choice. Put him in the freezer. So their was a dead member of their crew in the freezer for nearly 2 months. Oh and because they had to clear out room to fit him everyone on board was ordered to eat a triple serving of ice cream or it would go bad. "

10051,"I always get one bus earlier than I need, because then if it is late or doesn't show you're still ok. One day I got to work to find my colleagues panicking because my dad had called; he couldn't get hold of me (off button on my phone had been caught) and was worried because he'd seen that a bus on my route at about the time I'd be travelling had been smashed into by a lorry at a crossroads.

If I got the bus I needed, I would have been on it; as it was, I was already in the city by the time the accident happened and was calmly having a coffee as chaos was developing around me."
10052,"I've heard of this happening before, people will fake car crashes on the side of the road in rural areas and rob/murder/rape the people who try to help.

That's why I've always been told if you see something like that keep driving and call 911, let them handle it.

In one of these threads a few years ago I heard of a couple driving through a rural area on a 2 lane highway in the middle of nowhere at night and they come across this car blocking a lane and with clothes and luggage strewn about.

They drive slowly around it and see a body of a woman on the ground outside the open drivers door. It looked weird and set up so they kept driving, but had second thought and started backing up and as they did the person on the ground started getting up and a few people started walking out from the ditch/brush on the side of the road, can't remember which it was. 

The visualization of that stuck with me, and I always remember it now. "

SOMETHING causes these sanctums to appear to us when we need them, and seeing as these places are for sure not completely natural, close the ""door"" from the rest of reality to keep them safe when not needed.

Just mindless pain and instinct. First time in my life I had no thoughts. There was only pain. It was weird. The nurses even want you to groan low in your chest instead of screeching like you want to so you feel even more like some sort of beast.

She hung her head and followed me like a little kid that was in trouble. I asked her exactly what the problem was and she started in that I didn't do any work. I pointed that I was I several hours early and we all knew that was BS. She sputtered a bit and I said I was done.  I'd work the rest of my shifts, but not to put me on the next schedule.

10100,"If that kind of love is something you need in a relationship, don't marry her.

We all express love in different ways. My father's main ""love language"" is physical touch. All he honestly and genuinely needs to feel truly loved is a hug. My mother is *not* a very physically loving person. She is a loving person. She gives my father gifts all the time. That is how *she* expresses love. But she is not a *physical* person, and she and my father have been rocky for as long as I've known them and longer because they forget to go out of their way to express their love in the way the other person understands it best.

So she might be a good person, a fun person, a great friend, but if she can't give you love in the way you need, which might be words of affirmation if the doting really is your biggest issue, now, then what is life with her going to be in five, ten, twenty years?"

After enduring a lot of ridicule over what I wanted to draw (when the assignments were vague as ""draw daily!""), and having her scream at me during a presentation, I decided for the sake of my grade that I would do my final project as a traditional piece of art and I would make it as fucked up as possible.

I painted a canvas black, then cut myself enough to get some blood to paint smears with onto the canvas. Then I crushed up pain killers and glued them onto the canvas, and stuck on bandaids. I think I also painted a knife on, but I can't remember, all that sticks out in my memory is the blood and pain killers.

My story is similar: I was in a waiting room while my husband was undergoing lung surgery under general anesthesia. Simple procedure but scary anesthesia, plus, we were alone (10.000 miles away from our families).

Last September when she was staying with us she announced she was ready to take her dog Daisy back with her. She asked my dad if she could have his dog Devon as well so that they wouldn't be separated from each other. Dad said no, not just because he didn't want to lose Devon, but because he knew mom wouldn't look after him properly. Mom was supposed to be leaving with Daisy the following Tuesday and I quietly mentioned to my dad that he may want to take the day off to make sure mom wouldn't pull anything (as she is always doing). Dad thought I was being a tad paranoid because surely even she wouldn't stoop that low.

Monday evening I was getting ready to leave work and I get a phone call. Mom had taken both dogs and was already halfway across the country. Dad and I raced home and called the police and then an ambulance because I had the biggest panic attack of my life where I couldn't even breathe. It was not a very fun night for me.

Thankfully mom decided to return Devon the next day. She was it was for 'me', but I suspect it's because her new man didn't want Devon who is very uncomfortable around strangers. Either way I was glad to have Devon back. He didn't seem to miss Daisy at all and just continued playing with us, the cats and his toys.

Extra bit: Mom and her new man got kicked out of their home last March. She sent Daisy back to us claiming they needed a week to find a new place. Daisy is still with us nearly five months later. "

My girlfriend bought a laptop off them last November, was about £400. She opened it and the ‘P’ key was loose. Surprise surprise, a week later it fell off. She returned it, PC World said they’d send it off and have it sorted. Fast forward a week, it comes back. They ‘couldn’t do it because she didn’t send the key’. So she sent it back, this time with the key. A week later, it comes back still not fixed and this time missing the key. Somehow, they’d lost the key. Rather than just replacing it (because you’re not telling me they didn’t have one single ‘P’ key going spare in their entire warehouse), they’d just sent it back broken. Great. So my girlfriend rang them up, got told she had to go to a store. She went to a store, was told she had to ring them up. It’s now August, and this piece of shit laptop still hasn’t been fixed or refunded. She was fortunately able to buy another one (not from them) and so it didn’t wreck her studies, but it caused so much stress and upset and for what? 

Then just this past week, her mum’s partner bought a dishwasher off them. It got installed. It didn’t work. He rang them up immediately. They couldn’t send someone out until a couple of days later. So a guy comes out, confirms that it’s broken, then refuses to take it back because ‘it has to be done within 48 hours’. That’s a ridiculous rule in itself, but it was THEIR fault entirely that it wasn’t done in 48 hours. Now he’s stuck with a dishwasher that doesn’t wash dishes, all because he tried to save £100 by buying off these morons.

A word to the wise - do NOT, under any circumstances, buy ANYTHING from Curry’s/PC World. It might be cheaper, but it lowers your life expectancy by at least 10 years. They are a classic case of bending over backwards to take your money then not giving a shit."

I lost that passion around 2014 when one of my best friends died from cancer, stress over working on custom ordered pieces for customers, and the extreme disapproval and hypocrisy of my parents about my art burned me out. 

I'm forcing myself to doodle every now and then to try and get back into it, but it's damn hard when it feels like a part of yourself is missing. Art just isn't fun for me now and I feel so lost  without that part of me.

Then we left for a cardiologist appointment and they did an EKG and seemed completely unconcerned that her funky heart rhythm that used to happen 2-3x a year for 2-3 seconds is now happening 20-30x a day.

10428,"You're one lucky son of a bitch. My last job working security was a shit show. Our contract contained some pretty outlandish bull dung, but the most outrageous and borderline illegal thing was the part that stated that we are on call 24/7 (without bring paid for it, of course) and that we must answer the phone when contacted, even if you are on vacation or sick. Failing to do so enacted a 3 strike system. If you missed 3 calls you were fired. I'm dead fucking serious. Even if you are taking a shit and can't waddle to the phone in time you were given a strike. They expected you to have your phone with you at all times.

What's even more fucky is that there was an unwritten rule that if you were asked to come into work that it wasn't a question, it was a demand. If you refused to come in they would not hesitate to fire you on the spot for some random unrelated reason. One coworker of mine was fired for refusing to come in because his wife was in labor. He tried to sue but my cunt of a boss threatened to revoke his working visa which would ultimately lead to deportation. She was one evil bitch. The only reason she got away with all of this shit was because her husband was none other than the union rep, who was known to throw away every complaint.

I'm so glad they are bankrupt and out of business now. But I wish there was a way to destroy her fucking life like she did to so many others."

I've been asleep all night!"" But I'd just let her talk. She also likes to call me right before work and do the same thing.

Bartender came over and gave me $50. This was like 1979 and $50 was fortune to an 8 year old. The goodies in the Sears Catalog toy section were in my sights. Unfortunately, when we got home, my mom took my dough and started me my first bank account. I got a fancy bank book, so I felt like I was wealthy, but that didn't really compare to the toys I could've bought with my illegally  acquired funds. Eventually, it went towards my first dirtbike in the early 80s, a 1977 KD100, which was objectively way better and provided me with more enjoyment than the Star Wars guys and Micronaughts would have, but that feeling of having my money confiscated still gets to me."

We were listening to it loud as fuck with the windows down so when they approached, I thought there were going to just share in the jam, but apparently they thought I had flipped them off.  Turns out I knew one of them because his little sister gave me the second sloppiest handjob of my life and I came on her legs.

The thing was, I was really sick for two years and couldn't do too much.  He would grab his toy, throw it in the air and catch it as a way of making me smile.  Between chemo and radiation, I just began to feel better and would lay on the floor with him, whispering how once the weather got decent, we would go on hikes.  Then he just died.

Im still heartbroken - I really wanted to give him a better life than he had for two years.  Wanted to make up for lost time.  I focus on the fun we had, so like I said, it does get easier.

If we whip out lube, or ask you to use some, it is NOT meant as a slight against you or your sexual abilities. While we do self-produce lubricant, it is often times more pleasurable (for both parties) if a little extra is added. Also, naturally produced lubricant dries faster, and has a rather unpleasant feeling to it once it dries. I wish men would stop being so prudish or offended by the idea of lube. 


MEN, buy some lube (or ask your girl to pick some up of her choosing)!! And DON’T BE AFRAID TO USE IT. Make sure it’s one that is water-based if you’re using condoms, and try to keep it as natural as possible (skip the flavored kind if you’re using for intercourse). "

2. Not everyone has the same reactions. I for example, despise attention if I'm crying or visibly upset, but others might not. Don't use your wife's mother's cousin's baby's brother's pen-pal's dog as an example of what you should do with every autistic person.

3. Do your research on charities or whatever. Your heart might be in the right place, but your money might not be. Autism Speaks, for example, is an entity that does so little for, if not downright hurting, autistic people.

Almost three months ago my coworker suddenly died. He was diagnosed with a mild form of cancer the year before but was just declared cancer-free. Two days before he died I saw him for the last time. I'm currently on maternity leave and visited my workplace with my baby. His family never said what it was he died of so it is rumored he committed suicide. I was very close with him, he was 61 and could've been my father and I guess to some degree I saw him as a fatherly figure. He was my role model when it came to work and ever since I've started working there six years ago I've made it my goal to become like him one day. I'm starting work in three weeks again and I can't even imagine how it'll be without him being there. We were always the first ones at the office, we used the quiet time in the morning to talk about our day and private life over a cup of coffee. We've always worked Christmas Eve together as the only people at the office, he always wrapped his wife's presents at the office. We were not just colleagues but friends. I don't know if he really committed suicide or if he was lying about the cancer. It doesn't really matter to me, I just miss him horribly."

10565,"Everywhere in the world didn't come up with fire breathing though. That has been attached to all dragons in more modern times. The western world views dragons as fire breathing, four legged creatures because that is the amalgamation of many different traditions across Europe and the middle east.  This is where the classical literary drgan seen in books like the Hobbit and the song of fire and ice serries comes from.

These depictions are in stark contrast to Eastern dragons. These dragons tended to be depicted as long serpentine creatures that controlled rain. They were wise creatures of good luck, not meant to be hunted but rather sought after for their wisdom. They were companions to humans and guardians. (And before people say Mulan, remember that it is a westernized look at Eastern culture where western influences can be found). 

As for a possible reason for fire breathing being a part of the mythology, many fossils have a distinct brown color. This contrasts fresh white bones normally seen on recently killed animals. One way that normal white bones turn brown is when exposed to fire. Since all dragon bones are brown, all dragons must be related to fire. This last part is not proven in any way but is a personal theory I have."

Nah, you put on your best Sunday clothes, tie and everything, and ask her father first if he’s cool with it. Then you take her out to a restaurant, a real nice one, and don’t skimp out on the appetizers or anything. Finally, you ask her politely she’s down for some nice and relaxing porn.

I can't answer for his other family so I can only tell his story from my side. 

He worked as a truck driver so worked irregular hours and when he was 'tramping' would be out of the country for weeks at a time. I never questioned it as I worked in the same industry. He would be home with me for a week or 2 and then away for the same amount of time. I can only guess now that he was not working as much as he said he was. I should also say that I was earning way more than him so I only accepted money off him if necessary. Mostly I helped him out with cash, which I assume went to his other family.

His sleeping habits were terrible. In the early years I put it down to the job. Later years I put it down to his bipolar disorder. He would sleep for 2 hours and then be off out of the house for a few days. He would always keep in touch and let me know that he was ok.

From what I now know of his other family (in touch with his oldest son) he pretended to have cancer for about 10 years and we think he used this as an excuse to be elsewhere, whether with myself or other wife.

My mom grew up during a war where her town was being bombed. Her father, my grandfather, also died of a heart attack during the bombing, before I was born. She’s pretty much fine now, but still, over 50 years later, she has nightmares and wakes up screaming a few times every night, and if somebody sneezes or makes a noise at night, she’ll wake up freaking out that it’s a bomb. She refused to get therapy because she thinks she has too many problems for it, whatever the fuck that means, but I know that some of these problems could have been solved if she’d actually addressed them. She’s the only one in her family who still deals with problems this severe, and I think it’s probably because she refuses to talk about it or get help. Obviously nothing can undo it, but half a century is a long time to live like this. She also gets chronic migraines and other issues that are caused/exacerbated by the stress and lack of sleep. It breaks my heart. Please try to get therapy, for your own sake. I’m sure it seems permanent/insurmountable now, but proper help is the difference between dealing with these symptoms in your youth, and being almost 70 years old and going through the exact same thing like the day it happened. Please don’t let that happen to you. It’s horrible but it doesn’t have to be permanent. 

Wishing you the best of luck! ❤️"

For example, if you play a minor chord and then another minor chord transposed eight semitones up, it sounds ""dangerous"" like an evil character about to do something sinister. 

Edit: Thanks for popping my gold cherry! 

Edit 2: Here are some more examples. The numbers indicate the number of semitones between either chord and M and m to denote major and minor chords respectively. 

M2M: Protagonism

M6M: Outer space

M8M: Fantastical

M4m: Sadness, loss

M5m: Romantic, Middle Eastern

m5M: Wonder, transcendence (also M7m)

m2M: Mystery or dark comedy

m11M: Dramatic sound popular in early 21st century)

m6m: Antagonism, danger (less character-based)

m8m: Antagonism, evil (more character-based)

10738,"It really is! I’m a current high school student, and cliques definitely don’t have the same barriers as they used to. The sports players are all good students and talk about comicbook movies. Nerdy girls date jocks, and nerdy guys date cheerleaders. There are still people who vape or do drugs, but they aren’t annoying about it. Goth kids have been replaced with “weebs” (anime super-fans), but they are generally accepted despite being maybe the most outcast group. (A lot of popular kids also watch anime, so it’s not a big deal.) Every guy plays a lot of video games, and everyone loves watching nerdy shows on Netflix. People care a lot less about fashion or good looks than they used to. A lot of people, from every social group, really care about their grades and their college prospects, so studying and homework is taken seriously.

Popularity is defined by social abilities more than interests, as it should be. 

Also, crazily enough, social media seems to be on a downward trend (at least with people that I know). No one uses Twitter or Facebook, but some people are even deleting Instagram! Or at least using it less. Snapchat is still hugely popular, but that’s more like a messaging app (like iMessages) than it is a social media app (like Facebook).

Then there is the kind who is specifically is trying to portray some hobby or attitude because of the aesthetic it creates. Biggest one sadly the fake car guy. Most times these people are just getting into cars and feel overwhelmed and seem to feel the need to lie to feel like they fit in. It's more of a defense mechanism for people so they don't feel left out and is something many people work on correcting about themself.

But in general it's a gut feeling that is the proof and some small questions can figure it out. Sometimes these people are actually just being who they want to become and that's a fine way of making a change in themself as well. So yeah it's a lot of different possibilities I've seen. "

We didn't like that and decided that it made more sense for me to quit and her to keep working. I worked in academia and she is a surgeon so she was making more money. 

I loved it but my kids are 18 months apart and there was no way I could have worked and been a full time dad. I would have been doing one half assed. You can't sleep when the baby sleeps when your kids are on different sleep schedules. You can't sleep at night when they aren't. You have to take them out once they are old enough to socialize and my extroverted kid would go stir crazy inside the house. The rest of the time you are preventing kids from killing themselves or each other. It's really hard to focus on work when you have all that going on. 

My kids are teens now and I don't work a traditional job but I do a lot of volunteer work for habitat and our local animal shelter. I also filled in as a coach for my son's baseball team this year because they needed another guy. We get to be the fun house because parents like that we have an adult here to supervise and make sure things don't get too crazy.

I could see him and his partner looking at each other and talking about what to do about me.  My drunk ass could only think “Just keep walking as stable as you can and carry on, don’t act suspicious.”  So I just kept walking unsuspiciously carrying a huge branch.  After about 45 seconds they just drove off. Apparently I was undeterred, I woke up the next morning with the tree branch in my hotel bed.

Got it for half price in a fire sale when it tanked because of the expensive price (wich is much less than most ipad today). Nowadays I mostly use it for Spotify since it runs the PC version insted of the crappy mobile version that's more adds than music.

George loved science fiction and would have seen Star Wars on opening night as well as watched Star Trek when it was originally airing or during its reruns.

Marty got older and set fire to the living room rug and that's when George realized his son had been Calvin and he and Lorraine thought it was crazy but how else would it make sense, especially when there had never been an affair in their relationship and Marty was growing into the spitting image of Calvin. The introduction of the Calvin Klein underwear brand would have cemented the details. Once Marty started hanging out with a mad scientist in the form of Doctor Emmett Brown, everything clicked into place and the McFlys never questioned Marty because life was perfect for them and they appreciated all he did."

For me, what's weird is when a guy buys me a drink, I KNOW what it can amount to that night - if I play all the right moves, I could be sleeping with him. I feel like I'm one of those female birds from Planet Earth who's judging the dancing/plumage of a potential mate...the process is so similar that it's kinda creepy "

He had a heart tumor bigger than his heart, we had no idea, he had only been acting a little tired the past few days. I just feel so much guilt because I didn't get to see him off to the vet the day he went, and he died there at the vets, a place he was absolutely terrified of. We got his ashes the other day, and they spelt his name wrong on the urn. Even before the tumor he seemed to have bad luck, he had a chronic nasal condition and he was always a little rough around the edges, but we got him as a rescue kitten (he was the only kitten in his litter to survive) with the intention of giving him the best life we could, and I feel like I failed him.

Sat in the truck for about 5 minutes and 3 more cop cars pulled up. The original cop spoke on some megaphone and told me to get out of the vehicle with my hands up and walk backwards to his voice. Then when I was close to him I turned my head slightly and saw 4 cops pointing their guns at me. He told me to get on my knees. Then once I was on my knees, the stupid mother fucker kicked me in the back of the head and broke my nose on the concrete. He cuffed me and put me in his squad car. 10 minutes later he got in his front seat and told me my license was suspended (it wasn’t), but he was going to “be nice” and let me go with a warning.

Their toxicity against mammals is actually very nil, and the environmental concerns are ridiculous as well.  Do you all know what's in mothballs?  Naphthalene.  Do you know what else has  naphthalene?  A lot of things: wood, tobacco, coal, tar, lime, etc.

Also, as a fellow Floridian just FYI with all this algae/red tide problems: mothballs kill algae and red tide.

But one time, as I was driving home, I realized I already at the halfway point town. I hadn't left school in time for that to happen. So I looked at my car's clock: 6:30. I looked at my watch: 6:30. I looked at my phone: 6:30. But I had left school at 5:30. I started to doubt that was correct, but then I checked the text I sent to my parents to tell them I was leaving school and confirmed that I left at 5:30. There had been no time change (DLS or crossing time zones), so I really started to think about it and the last time I could remember seeing was a turn that I had never seen before and oddly thinking that it might cut down on drive time. (This is a really simple state road system.) After that, the last thing I could remember was seeing a gas station with a very particularly painted semi parked in the parking lot...and then nothing for a long time...and then looking at my clock and realizing it was 6:30.

To this day, I could draw you a picture of what the road branching off that I took looked like and I could draw you a picture of the gas station and the semi truck. But I have no idea how I lost ended up making it about an hour faster on a road that most certainly does not exist. This happened my junior year, so I had already made the drive many times, had never seen the road, and made the drive many more times, only to never see the road again. The road exists on no map and it's big enough that it would have to. 

That night, I made the rest of the drive seriously not understanding how it happened, how I blanked out, or how I was early. When I arrived home early, my parents were surprised because they were expecting to have to stay up later to see me. I told them what happened and they didn't understand, which is understandable.

I just want to know where or what that road is."

10947,"I feel for you, it sucks to have to pick up the pieces of a broken management. Most bad managers are also territorial and easily threatened, a horrible combination for someone in a powerful position. 

My manager isn't doing well with our hires either. He came up to my coworker and I to ask us to ""give the new guy something to do"". It was his 3rd day so I figured he could start packing with us, after all he had been the previous 2 days.... I found out my manager didn't even show him our software properly! The most crucial difference is the view, we change it when we ship. Apparently my manager has been watching this guy pack up stuff and has NEVER corrected him or even informed him about it. Our second to last hire also had no idea about this different view, I showed her on her 2nd month. This girl also had been hit on relentlessly to the point of having a coworker go up to her in front of the manager and ask her about her partner. After the manager found out she wasn't single like he thought, he didn't teach her much and just let her do her thing. 

Yet my manager walks around the office like he owns this shit, complaining about the problems new hires are causing to the girl he's fucking in the office. He also said outloud he might be mean to a girl that might get hired just because she's family with the owner, he doesn't want any of them in our office.

10949,"Worked at a fast paced restaurant as the lead cook, closed alone on Saturday nights as we were open very late (2am) and business in the kitchen died off around 10pm.

I noticed after two checks that I was being clocked out at 10pm Saturday’s. Spoke to the chef, she told me she’d fix it. 

Next check came, same shit. I talked to the owner, he said he’d fix it. I’ll have all my missed hours on my next check. 

Next Friday payday comes. Check is short. Again. No hours compensated. At this point I’ve been wage-theft victim of 80+ hours. 

I half-ass prep my station, enough to get me through about an hour. I cook until it gets “super fucking slammed balls to the wall busy”, and fuckin’ leave. At this point there’s fifty tickets in the window and my station is dead empty. Any little things leftover I had tossed in the trash. Petty, whatever. 

Whoever (presumedly the chef) needed to pick up that slack definitely had a terrible night. The other four cooks that night all sucked at their jobs, and my station was the busiest of the five.

It is a great method for helping people quit cigarettes but is not a safe alternative.  It is also getting more people to try nicotine because the vaping companies and those who haven't researched say it isn't harmful.  These are some of the reasons for the demonization.

Yes, some people fuck up their lives. But a lot of people's lives fuck *them* up. It's good to have compassion and understanding for those people.

Edit: it seems I had my facts a little confused. Deaths from opiate withdrawals are possible, but rare unless there are other underlying medical conditions. Beating the addiction is nevertheless very difficult, and demonizing and criminalizing people for the addiction will not fix the problem."

11027,"First, many people will disagree with what I did and how I handled my situation. 

I was in Millennium Park in Chicago. It was a beautiful summers night and I was on a date with a girl. We got pizza and decided to eat it at the park for nostalgia. We get to the park around 7:30? The sun is starting to go down, but it’s still pretty light out and there are a lot of people around us. We were eating pizza just enjoying each other’s company. It was going really well. We were sitting on some stairs near a small fountain. I still remember I was in the middle of laughing at something she said with a pizza in my hand when some black kid (had to be around 21-23) jumped down, squatted in front of us and said “i have a gun, if either of you scream, I will kill you”. At first I thought it was a joke, maybe a friend of hers, I don’t know. But I offered him pizza right away. He looks at me and says “you think this is funny? I will kill you”. At this point, I know it’s not a joke and we are essentially being robbed, in daylight, in a crowded area, in the middle of downtown Chicago. Was this man smart or dumb. I saw people passing by, like nothing was happening. He had his hand in his pocket with the gun pointed right at us. I never actually saw the gun, but I guess he was never going to swing it around in front of a lot of people. Maybe there never even was a gun. But, I wasn’t going to challenge him. 

He demands our phones, cards, and money. My friend gave everything to him without a thought. I didn’t. As I was slowly getting out my phone from my back pocket, I was observing EVERYTHING about him. I said to him “nice J’s” and I give them a pat with my hand and admire them. I don’t know SHIT about Jordan’s, but when a gun is pointed at me, I’m the biggest fan. He tells me “I didn’t buy them, my grandma did”. I said something else and somehow got him talking about his daughter. I’m still slowly reaching for my other things when he said “I’m sorry, I don’t want to do this” and I ask “well then why are you?” I bring his daughter into it and say something like “she needs you, it would suck if you were put in jail for shit like this”. More words were exchanged, I don’t remember the entire situation, it all happened so fast. Ultimately, I made this dude feel fuckin bad. He looked down at the ground so ashamed of himself and gave us our things back. 

Mind you, people are still walking around us and have no idea we are being threatened with our lives. My date is in tears at this point and I’m just shaking from adrenaline and shit. He explains how he can’t find a job so is forced to commit these crimes to make money. I told him I’d help him get a job and that his daughter will be so proud of him if he finds one. He tells me about his felonies keeping him from finding a job and I give him a few examples of places that will hire felons. 

My date, in tears, sitting there listening to us converse asks “can I go home now”? 

I look at her, chuckle, and casually tell him I should take her home. He lets us go with all of our belongings. I throw him a 20 for his troubles. 

Thank god for my charisma. Was that a gun or a Twinkie in his pocket? I’ll never know. BUT, I don’t suggest anybody doing what I did. I might’ve tested my luck that day.

The problem was she lived in another country when stuff happened and we only had glimpses of what her life was like when she lowered her guard and wasn't hallucinating, although there were evident inconsistencies between her narrative and her behavior around men that lead us to the sexual abuse theory. When questioned about sexual related stuff, she could tell up to a specific time frame and then her unconscious defenses went up. Her family are the nicest people and tried their best to help her, but we had a hard time trying to stabilize her due to bad treatment attachment. She stayed inpatient as long as long as her medical insurance would cover and we recommended to the family taking her to therapy.

11053,"My mom had a period when she met a new guy and married him and wanted to ""toughen up"" her spolied children. I lived with my dad, but was visiting for summer.

I was 14 and I have always, always hated mushrooms. My mom has always resented this, as we were poor and mushrooms were a good way to fill out stews, pasta sauces etc. and everybody else loved them. She forced me to ""taste it"" every damn single time, convinced I was just being fussy, making me detest them even more - even today, 25 years later, I can still puke instantly if I taste the texture of mushrooms.

So she makes fried vegetables for breakfast. About half of it is mushrooms, the cheap, nasty canned version. I say I don't want it. She goes on a rant on how spoiled I am and tells me there will be no other food. For context, I have always loved food and eating and was an extremely hungry growing teenager at this time.

I say fine. She then serves me the same portion of woked vegetable-mushroom mix for breakfast, lunch and dinner for three days straight and I refuse to eat each time. The portion had molded after the third day, and then she realised perhaps I'm not just fussy, I can't eat mushrooms."
11054,"Not an EMS/EMT - Oblig - but it's a story about medical personnel misbehaving badly at a festival.

I worked the gate at a regional Burn. We'd had a great night - my partner and I - on a few substances. We'd danced, watched the lights, got freaked the fuck out by some fucker who put LED flashers in a balloon and flew it over the site... Great time. 

We staggered down to the gate for our 8AM shift, thermoses of coffee and bags of jerky in hand. Checked in with our Vikings (perimeter security), Ranger contacts, and found our clipboards. The gate didn't actually open till 9 - we were there to do meetings and get all the stuff prepped. SOAK ran Thursday through Monday, and we'd come in Thursday night. It was now Friday morning, and the handful of cars that had missed the cut-off Thursday night were lined up in the entrance lanes, either sleeping in their driver's seats or with tents popped up behind. 

Then there was Jackass. Jackass was parked in the lane, and up bright and early, swigging from a jug. It looked like kombucha, but honestly, who the fuck knows. He turned on his music. No one paid attention to him. He cranked his music. No one paid attention to him. He started singing. No one paid attention. 

One of our Rangers informed us he'd come in late, and had a... discussion... with a Viking last night and was probably fucked up. But they were going to play him by ear. 

As we ignored him, he started to approach other people in the line. At first it seemed normal, slightly-off-kilter festival goer. Except he keeps escalating. People don't want to sing - they're caffeinating and brushing their teeth. It's 8:15 AM. We suggest he turn his music down, and things quiet down for a bit. 

Then he gets bored. Suddenly leaps into his car, slaps it into reverse, tries to pull a J-Turn, does a few donuts, and takes out one of our fence lines. Then he parks back in the intake lane and pumps the music back up. 

We consult with rangers and decide he's not coming in, but that we're not going to be confrontational. He can have the lane and we'll just ignore him and direct everyone around.

WE start letting other cars in. He keeps escalating. 

Finally a producer comes down to chat with him and tell him security is excluding him from the event. She's one of the kindest people I know. Things do not go well. The plan had been to let him sleep off whatever he was on so he didn't risk DUII, but suddenly Producer straightens up: ""GET THE FUCK OFF OUR PROPERTY"". He's bounced. Instead he pulls back into the intake lane, does a few more donuts, then spends 15 minutes lecturing us about Buddhism and how his inherent worth as a free man means he's allowed on any site he wants. We're suppressing his aura and enslaving him... As we called Sheriff's deputies, he finally left. 

It also turns out he was a naturopathic physician, and during the conversation with the Vikings overnight he'd name-dropped a patient who were on staff for the festival. Which, as you may well know, is a *MASSIVE* fucking HIPAA violation. I believe our producer reported that as well. "

My mom actually knew the answer, and the guy went on to win the million dollars. He gave the four of us in the family 10k each and I think my parents another 10k each a year later (had something to do with taxes.) I was a kid at the time so my parents invested my portion on my behalf. A few years ago I got the money transferred to my account and it was a cool 9.7k.

edit: There were no taxes on the 10k. I think 10k was the gift limit where there's no taxes, which is why he gave us the money this way. This was in 2000 (holy shit, this was 18 years ago??). My mom put the money in an investment account with a broker she was already using and it did extremely poorly. It also wasn't invested the whole time. I think it was in savings limbo for a few years as I disentangled my finances from my parents when I became a working adult.  I remember learning in college that the average broker underperforms the market, and I myself only invest in indexes/funds."

About 20 minutes went by and ofc I spent all the money. But there was a table of prizes with these dragon statues which I really liked. So instead of paying to play games to win the dragon statues I decided to steal about 20 of them and put them in my bag. 

Later that day I went to a friends birthday party and while I was there my dad found the dragon statues and since he was at the fair knew I didn't have anywhere near enough money to buy them. 

He was a very strict father and went mental when I got home. Made me take them back to school and apologise to my headteacher which is the single most embarrassing thing I've ever had to do, but even worse he took away my Nintendo for 3 months!

I had found it online as a really cool place to try in town, and we were feeling very experimental and decided to try it. And let me tell you, it was really good! We got like this shared assortment platter thing that had a whole bunch of different kinds of sushi, stuff we've never tried before but we both really enjoyed it and had a lot of fun. Cut to a couple of hours later, we get to my place and we're on my bed watching a movie. About half an hour into it, I felt a little uncomfortable in my stomach and had to go to the one bathroom I had in my apartment. I quickly, relieved myself and then went out, still feeling a little bit ill. And my boyfriend was sitting there on my bed like ""Yeah, I have to go too,"" and went to the bathroom immediately after. After he got out, we were both just feeling very gross and sick. We had realized after that that we probably got food poisoning from the sushi place. So we made a quick trip to Walmart to get some Tums to try and settle our stomachs a little back at my place. We were both like groaning because the place was super good and it was so disappointing that it ended with us both feeling sick. We have vowed to never, ever, ever go back to that place again. "

Essentially there's some imagery there, and some alt-righters claimed they uncovered a conspiracy. More likely some producer or writer who, purposefully or not, inserted their own fetishes into their work. Usually it's just one-off episodes, but in this case the name of show as well as the casting choices make it look very obvious once you view it through that lense. 

Also, many fetishes begin manifesting at a young age, often due to an early sexual feeling associated with something non-standard. Because children's shows are sometimes outlets for deviant sexual thoughts, some kids pick up on them, they can have those same fetishistic thoughts impressed upon them. 

Maybe that kid grows up, becomes an animator, gets a job at a studio, it's crunch time and they need 6 more episodes by the end of the week, and a couple storyboards get passed through in which they subtly reference their own fetishes. The cycle continues?"

11189,"Kishimoto was never good at romance or really anything involving female characters. His whole focus was elsewhere. Romance was always an after thought.  He focused on creating character parallels and boils, developing the very main characters, and establishing a fuckton of ""ideals"". I think Naruto never really realized Hinata loved him in that sense and that he loved her back because he never felt love, with the whole orphaned and alienated thing. However for as much filler Naruto has, youd think he would try to include the smallest bit of depth of side characters and arcs."

11192,"Here's mine. A few months ago, I was with my girlfriend getting some grub at a glorified gas statiom after work. Shortly into our ""meal"", a man who looked rather unwashed and distressed walked by, sat down near us, and asked how we were doing. We both said good, and asked how he was out of courtesy. He replied, ""Well, this is the worst day of my fucking life. I just got out of prison, I've walked for miles trying to get back home, since nobody came to pick me up, I have no money and no connections, no job, and no family now,"" and proceeded to sit down and sulk with his Pepsi that he most likely bought with either the last of his money, or loose change he managed to scrape up. I walked over and sat next to him and asked him if he wanted to talk about it, to which he declined. We exchanged names, I gave him my number, and told him to stand up. He asked why, and I told him to just do it. I gave him the most heartfelt brohug I have ever given, and I felt him break down in tears in my arms. It's a fucking heartbreaking feeling, feeling a man who's done time be reduced to tears. I told him if he needed to find a job, I could get him one, and if he needed somebody to talk to, that I was there.

Their families hate each other, and because of this, they never get a chance to get to know one another.  Then, take into account their lack of patience and rashness, their tragic flaws, they never look at any of the other options that the other characters literally tell them to do.

There's more to it than that, but a lot of it comes down to their situation.  Is their love real?

Some rich people are the worst, I know two rich people, one is a fucking nightmare and the other one is a fucking daydream.

I met the first one during my summer job when I was I high school. He was the CEO of the company I was working for. Two things happened: first he strolls around the warehouse not wearing any protective gear (which is mandatory), barking at some poor fella on the phone. He is seemingly angry, so I just duck behind my pile of cardboard boxes I had to fold (2464 of em to be specific), he just walks over and just fucking throws the stacks of 10 I finished over. 200 boxes sprawled all over the floor, great thing.

Next week, I arrive, get out me car, go do some work. Shifts over, I want to drive home but can't. Why? Because a dope ass BMW M5 blocked me. I go in, tell the receptionist the number plate and ask if that person could maybe move his vehicle so I could leave, CEO ass comes out, nothing about how he had so much to do and how this was bullshit and why I couldn't ""just wait"" (after 8hrs of folding fucking cardboard boxes and sorting 2400 tiny ass springs that cut your fingers). So he reluctantly moves his vehicle, almost crashing into mine before I got in, turned the volume up high enough to make the seats vibrate and drove the fuck outta there. He was a really shitty rich ass who thought he could do whatever he wants with the people under him


The good guy was some dude I met at a bar, wearing really a really expensive looking suit and stuff. Like, billionaire kind of clothing. I drink some, he drinks some, we talk a lil and I get up to leave. I pull out me wallet, and he goes ""Nah dude, it's fine, ive got you"" and pays my bill. We walked out together and then our ways pretty much parted instantly, he went left, I went right. Met him a few times after that, one time driving a Maybach iirc. Always cheerful and optimistic, never brags about how much money he had... I want to be him when I grow up tbh"

The human brain is a fascinating machine because it picks up on millions of bits of information every second, especially things you aren't even aware of. If you are about to walk to your car alone at night and feel weird about it, listen to your intuition and get someone to walk with you. Pay attention to people and consider their intentions. I highly recommend reading *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker. I touches on the importance of trusting your intuition so you can hopefully avoid a situation where you have to physically defend yourself.

If things *do* escalate to where you're being attacked, say someone is trying to mug you, throw your wallet in one direction and run in the other. Make as much noise as possible. If you cannot get away, attack the eyes and groin.

Edit: I forgot to mention - a pet peeve of mine is when people suggest lacing your car keys in between your fingers to attack an assailant. Now try doing this to a piece of cardboard. It doesn't work. Your fingers don't have enough strength to hold the keys stable enough to do any real damage. Instead, grip the biggest key you have, like your car key, in the palm of your hand like you would a knife if you were trying to stab someone overhead, and aim for the face/throat."

Luckily BIL and his brother were young and don’t remember much, because it was not a easy task for them to escape. I can’t even imagine having your mind normalize this, but the brain will do crazy things to protect you.

It wasn’t anything violent but as a young kid, it really scared me. My mom said it was the devil getting into my head because my dad invited him into our house by watching porn and masturbating and cheating/buying sex. She said the only way for me to get rid of the voices I was hearing was to tell the devil to get out of my mind. 

It was really scary and I think I could’ve avoided time in the hospital at 15 (due to severe suicidal ideation) if I’d actually gotten help for my mental illness when it first presented.

My uncle is a lieutenant in my town so I'm comfortable around the police, at least respectful, I open the door and immedietly I hear the yelling of commands and the sounr of guns be drawn and readied, a sound that really shakes you to the core. I get on my knees, hands on head as they approach and frisk me. They start asking about weapons in our house and what to expect when they search it. At this point I'm very shaken but mostly confused. I tell them the only weapon is  pink camo bb gun from a carnival and kitchen knives and why are they going to search our home? Turns out our neighbor, who is a total prick and hates us, called and said there was a shooting in our back yard! My roommate then starts his dreadful confession, he set off a "" dry ice bomb"" with the ice he used to transport food from Texas. The cops and myself stare in disbelief as their partner comes out of the back yard with the empty and blown container and the pink camo bb gun. We all just started laughing except my roommate who thinks he's about to arrested. The cops told him to not blow anything up and get a better gun and left, I later got a call from my uncle asking if we had a liscense for the gun, just to mess with my roommate some more. "

Easier: no one is telling you what to do 24/7. You have the freedom to do what you want, when you want. The professors (in most cases) want to help you learn, and are (in most cases) very knowledgeable in their subjects.

Harder: freedom is a double edged sword. Some let it go to their head and they blow all their potential and money out of the water. No one is making sure you get up for your 8 am, no one is asking you if you've done your homework, no one is tracking your money for you. Discipline can be a bitch and a half to learn if you don't pick it up instantly. Budget, get a planner, and set as many alarms as you need to in order to get up in the morning.

I can cook and clean, I can fix things, I can do electrical work, plumbing, carpentry, painting, and work on my car. I'm not too bad with money. They helped me with math and reading, and my homework so I did well in school.  They've helped with money when I was younger. Saving up for an xbox definitely taught me the value of money (my mom always had the deal that she'd pay half of any large purchase as long as I could save up for rest). 

I don't think I got much help or advice in the making friends or getting girlfriends department.  I didn't have much luck with either until college.

Then the scene where Zuko apologizes to Iroh. That one will never not choke me up and make me cry. Everything about that scene was done perfectly. From each catch in a word, to that build up in the score with the big crash when Iroh grabs Zuko, to how stunned Zuko is at being shown the compassion of a loving parent, and even the small little “It wasn’t hard Uncle, you have a strong scent” to finish it off. Probably my favorite scene in ATLA, though the Zuko x Azula Agni Kai could give it a run for its money."

They can reliably parry blaster shots, something which they couldn't do without a lightsaber (or at least not as reliably; some force users seem capable of stopping blaster shots with the force alone but it probably takes more effort), and they aren't really in need of a ranged weapon themselves since the force can be used at quite a long range. The lightsaber offers a lot of utility as well, such as being able to cut their way through just about any material. The only times they need other weapons are when they fly in spaceships, but then they actually do use the spaceships built-in weapons."

* Empathy: There seems to be less undercutting and more of a support structure for other millenials on the job. There is more of a sense of easy collaboration (as opposed to siloed work that is jealously guarded) and trust. They seem to be looking out for each other; and if you can show them that you're a compassionate and considerate coworker, they start looking out for you too.

She’s my friend, and I enjoy having her as my friend very much. Not to mention she’s younger and her life/personality is not what I’m looking to hitch up to right now. She has a lot of growing to do. “Bro fuck that, just fuck her and call it a day”. They just can’t seem to understand that I’m not into that child shit anymore. I’m also not looking to add a chasm to our friend group. I’m not about to fuck up the good thing we have going by dicking down this girl and leaving her high and dry. She’s my friend First and a hot girl second. 


They also can’t grasp the concept that I need an emotional connection with established trust before I sleep with someone. My brain is just wired differently that way. If I’m not comfortable being completely open and myself around a girl, she’s gonna have a real tough time getting celli jr. To stand up. My nerves and anxiety of letting the unknown past my walls far outweighs the physical stimulation. Those walls exist for a reason. I spent many years building them to avoid making the same emotionally costly mistakes that destroyed me years ago. "
11477,"Yeah. And the injuries you got if you look at the shadows are extremely horrific. She died slowly and in a lot of pain. I am genuinely surprised that Littlefoot isn't a fucked up little headcase; his first defining life experience was watching his mother die horribly and then slowly starving to death alone in a wasteland while being hunted by his mom's killer.

That was not a kids' movie thing to do!

11480,"We started a startup a few years ago with an idea and found a few investors one of which was the rich father of the guy who I went to school with and graduated together. Obviously he became our ""VP"" because of his dad and also because according to himself "" He cannot work in a company unless he is in charge and he cannot take orders from a boss.""

At that time I did not watch The Office but last year when I watched it for the first time I was surprised how Michael Scott resembles him. A few examples on top of my head:


-One morning I was in his office when on of the employees (5 employees total) got to the office late, maybe 9:45 or something. As she walked in He asked her why she was late and she replied with some excuse and walked away. He turned to me and said: Did you see that? She thinks that she is smarter than me. Someone needs to tell her that if she was smarter than me SHE would be running this company not me.


-He arranged office soccer with a bunch people from school. During the game he was totally a Michael Scott (if you recall him playing basketball). He was out of shape and barely could run and sucked at soccer but he would yell at employees for not running enough and not passing the ball to him and he would get really pissed if someone used good soccer skills on him. 


-He would occasionally use the phrase: ""Guys remember, you are very valuable to this company. In this company I am the brain and you are the muscles.""


-One time we were having lunch with other coworkers and I was having a salad. Here is the conversation:

Him: I have noticed you are having salad everyday these days. Whats up?

Me: Well I haven't been able to go to the gym in the past few weeks and I have been sitting at my desk all day. I gotta watch my calories. Otherwise I'll gain weight.

Him: You must have some genetic problem. I have never gone to a gym and I have been sitting all day everyday at my desk in the past 8 years and I am fine. 

Now I am not a muscular jock or anything but I regularly exercise and I am relatively fit. He on the other hand is known for being overweight to everyone who knows him. Everybody at the table was shocked at this conversation. 

Good times.

The acting was the kind you'd be super embarrassed to even show to your wife, but I thought it was JJ Abrams grade action.

We arrive out front of the auditorium and other people start arriving. They know her. And they’re introducing themselves to me and asking questions about what I do. I’m wondering wtf is going on but playing along. 2 guys hug and kiss her and look at me weird. Then they’re all like “ok we’re all here let’s go!”

Let’s go?

Everyone starts walking into auditorium and I’m slowly drifting backwards from the group. Tinder girl tells me to trust her. This makes me trust her less. We get to the foyer and there’s hundreds of people in bad business wear. Like, the suit you know is their only suit that’s dusted off for jury duty or funerals.

Giant sign above the entrance “USANA”. I have no idea what Usana is (Australian) so I do a discrete google. Motherfucking pyramid scheme. And this is their monthly sign up gig. 
.__.

What the hell. I go in because I’m actually kind of interested in the psychology behind these things. The date is essentially over for me and I’m 400meters from home. Is there gonna be hypnosis? 

Lots of “doctors” whose grandparents inexplicably don’t have cancer any more. Some alpha males who own a freaking BOAT and have FRIENDS. Lots of super high production value videos about health. Nothing too crazy. Interestingly no hard sell at all.

We walk out and the group is on me like vultures. Asking if I’m into passive income. I’m trying to hold back laughter and play dumb while asking how it works. Eventually I give up and say they’re a pyramid scheme. They start making arguments like “the Girl Scouts org chart is shaped like a pyramid. Does that make it a pyramid scheme?!” And I’m like... no that’s a volunteer org. “Your business has owners and managers and staff? That’s a pyramid!” Again. No. That’s a classic business hierarchy. 

It’s not fun any more. I tell Karen to go fuck herself. But also I’m impressed at the Hustle. I walk home wondering if she offers sex on signup. I’d put money on those two weird dudes being previous tinder prey that she snared. 

TL:DR - tinder date turns out to be a pyramid scheme presentation. I go in for the hell of it. Disappointing. 1/10"

If we could gift this ""jackpot"" to every newborn and in general create a healthier society then why wouldn't we? I'm sure there are arguments about furthering the schism between social and economic classes, but even if only half the population becomes basically a non-issue medically, then that much resources are freed up to support people who are not genetically immune to diseases and cancers.

In other words, an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was elucidated in the 1969 book The Peter Principle by Peter and Raymond Hull."

11640,"So why not just assume everybody is worthy of a decent level of respect until they prove otherwise? I never understood people who could make snap judgments on how much they respect somebody based off appearance. Everyone goes through their shit. Maybe they’re having a bad day, but any other day you’d find them “worthy” of being treated well by you. On the other hand, maybe you’re paying excess levels of respect to a man (maybe because he has a child with him) who just came out to the store with his kid after beating the shit out of his wife. He’s not deserving of anything extra but you would never know. Better, and maybe wiser, to treat everybody with the same degree of respect. "

Early in the evening I left my apartment and walked down the street to hang out with a friend at his place. He was encouraging me to drink heavily and I indulged but I kept thinking to myself, ""after this one I need to go home.""

When I did wake up, I was very confused about the situation but quickly exited the strange apartment. I went outside, strategically covering my junk with my hands and realized that I was on the right street, just in the wrong building. It was probably about 3:30 or 4:00 AM and I should consider myself lucky that I didn't live on a busy street. 

I ran down the street to my building and entered my code to get inside, but my apartment door was locked. I tried knocking on my neighbor's door to borrow a towel but there was no answer. I decided I had no choice but to scale the building up to my balcony and let myself in. When I got inside, I found my clothes, keys, phone, and wallet in my bedroom next to an unmade bed.

I believe that after drinking heavily I made my way home, derobed, and passed out in bed. Then at some point I drunk-sleep-walked ""home"" to the wrong building as my subconscious must've still been fixated on ""I need to go home after this"". I lived in apartment X, I woke up in apartment X in another building. Some months later I checked to see if my door code worked on the other building and it did.

11886,"Shit even nation wide gyms like LA Fitness are scammy. I got a membership to one because I lived a 5 minute walk away. Used it for 4-5 months before I moved pretty far from any of their locations. I wasn't paying attention the first month after I moved and forgot to cancel. I figured that was on me, so I called them, said I was cool with the month they just charged, but that I wanted to close my account out immediately.  The person on the phone said no problem, walked me through some verification steps, and said my account was canceled.

A month later I got charged for the membership again. I called up and asked what the hell happened. They said I had to cancel my membership in person. Damn, that's a 30 minute drive but that's cheaper than $40 a month forever so I drove up to the gym, told them I wanted to cancel, filled out entirely too much paperwork, was told AGAIN my membership was canceled. Called the bank and got my money back for the last charge.

A month after that I got charged AGAIN. Called the gym and asked what the bell was going on. They said something got filled out wrong on the paperwork. I made the journey to LA Fitness, filled out the paperwork again, got the manager to make and sign copies for me, told them to kiss my ass, and that I'm telling my bank any charge from LA Fitness is a fraudulent charge, and even got a new card. 

A YEAR LATER, I got a call from my bank saying LA Fitness was trying to charge me 12 months of bills all at once. I told them I haven't seen an LA Fitness in a year, and canceled over a year ago. My bank refused the charges and sent me a new card to be safe. (Still don't know how they got my new card info) I called their corporate office, asked what the deal was. The manager who signed my paperwork left LA Fitness, so my best guess is they (upper management or the new manager trying to get his numbers up) went through all the cancellations under his management and tried to charge them all again. 

The one thing that weirdly ended this nightmare? A one paragraph review on the BBB website. Got a phone call from someone in the corporate office apologizing and asking for me to remove the review (even after it is resolved it stays up for some time). 

Now I go to a gym in my office building that costs $10 a month and doesn't have any kind of contract, just a safety waiver/general behavior agreement."

Otherwise, just from aesthetic perspective. I like the contrast in color from normal skin. I also like women that happen to have darker hair and lighter skin so maybe I just like contrasting colors in general.

11967,"Nobody is going to see this but I think it's a fun story so here we go. . . 

I was in jail for a bit. There was one TV in the main area of our pod that picked up just a few channels. Certain guys who had been in this pod for a while got to make the call on what we watched. Part of the day was the Spanish channel, part of the day was news, part of the day was sports. With a few exceptions, that was about all that was ever on. 

Sports. News. Spanish. Often, news about sports in Spanish.

Jail is loud. A hundred people in a concrete room talking over each other does that. Because of this, no mater what channel the TV was on, the volume was full blast and you could still barely hear it. 

One day, somebody pissed off a pod father by starting a fight over what was on TV. Fighting over the TV is good way to lose the TV so this pod father decided to punish the whole block by turning on *Emperor's New Groove* instead of some basketball or football game that everyone wanted to watch. 

At the first commercial break, we had to turn down the volume. At the second break we had to turn it down again. You know why? Because this room full of loud obnoxious criminals finally shut the hell up and stopped yelling over the TV. 

Now, one might think this was people being quiet to keep from missing another game the next day. But I dunno. There was an awful lot of laughter for the jokes and there were a ton of eyes on that screen.

11998,"The short answer is to say yes, the legitimate sites and businesses at the end of the clickbait rabbit hole do see a return from the whole thing. These won't be real numbers, but think of it like this:

Outlet A – a small (but still legitimate) online periodical – gets ten thousand visitors a day. This is barely enough to keep the site up, so they look for inexpensive advertising options. They find a network that's willing to charge ten dollars a day, with the caveat that Outlet A's site will be featured alongside other, similar sites. Outlet A is now in competition with those other sites, so they take steps to make their content – which, again, is legitimate – stand out a little bit more. The end result is that Outlet A gets five thousand additional visitors a day (which is enough to offset the cost of advertising, and then some), but only because they've adopted tactics which make them look suspiciously similar to clickbait."

To save the company, President Reagan instituted a massive tariff (something like 50%) on Japanese made bikes.  Thus, HD was cost competitive again.  They still couldn't command high prices like they do today, but it at least stopped the bleeding and the company was able to stay afloat.

So... Cash bailout?  No.

12039,"On a flight out for a long weekend, I decided to sit next the two unaccompanied minors on the plane. As soon as I sat down, the flight attendant was like “Are you sure? We usually don’t get volunteers for sitting with the kids.” I decided I was sure, and settled in for a three hour flight. The weather decided to strand us on the runway for an extra two hours, however. Normally, this would have been terrible and boring and stressful, and everyone in the plane would be in a bad mood. With these kids, I had a high old time. 

They were two boys, 9 and 11, not related, but both going home to one parent after a summer with the other. I started asking them questions, trying to make conversation, and they opened up and started asking questions right back. Most of their questions were typical of elementary schoolers— how does X work? why is Y that way? — and I did my best to answer them. At one point I accidentally introduced, and therefore had to explain, the concept of schrödinger’s cat, which lead to explaining quantum physics (in the most basic limited sense) and then somehow multiverse theory? We also talked about air pressure and gas density and how molecules worked, and so much more. One boy showed me his summer memory scrapbook, and the other found out I coded and had so many questions for me (he was appropriately wearing a “future hacker” tshirt). The flight attendants gave us these punch out planes to build, and we soared them around our seats and made up some stories. All in all highly entertaining. 

The best part however, came at the end of the flight. The boy with the scrapbook had his mom take a picture of the three of us, so he could add it in. But then, even better, were all of the adults who came up to me and said thank you, which confused me at first. They wanted to express their pleasure at seeing me, a young-ish student, interacting in a genuine way with the next generation. Everyone sitting around us was happy and in an all together better mood for watching curiosity be encouraged. It remains my ultimate goal whenever I interact with children."

My grandpa was called for the Korea draft. He was an engineer by trade, and very rule abiding.  He reported as instructed, and check in with the commanding officer. Since he was the first person to arrive, the officer handed him a list of all of the people who were reporting, and told him to check everyone else in. 

Once he finished, Grandpa checked back in and was told to have everyone read the swearing in oath and then board the train. My grandpa had everyone swear in and loaded them onto the train, as instructed. After the train left, Grandpa checked back in with the officer. The officer asked him why he didn't get on the train to head to basic training. Grandpa responded that he did exactly as instructed, and had not been told to get onto the train. The officer asked him if he had the oath, and Grandpa said no, because he hadn't been instructed to do so.

Rather than reroute the train or hold it up for him to get on it, the officer told Grandpa to re-report for the next round of basic training, in about a month's time. By the end of the month, the draft had ended, so when Grandpa re-reported, he has sent home. Thus ended his non-existent military career. "

12087,"I also had the shadow man. Looked like a man wearing a coat with the collar turned up, and a hat with a wide brim. That figure was never in any childhood ghost story I had seen and I can't think of why I'd imagine that shape or figure. You're lucky yours just watched. Mine would move through the room with footsteps. Would stand on my bed and I could feel the bed move. Would open and close my door but strangely only a thin thin amount. 

On occasion it would tug at the covers or sometimes throw them across the room with force and I would scream. Parents thought I kicked in my sleep but nope. Father even saw this 9ft shadow man a few years later. He saw it in the dead of night standing on the farm across from us. He described the same thing. Went out with his gun but it was gone. 

Years later I had a girl I'd just met that night see it standing behind me. We were at a live outdoor gig and she fell off her chair in terror and her first words were ""I saw your demon"". She cried a lot and left to go home. She had no way of knowing about it and no reason to leave because we had paid hefty entry fees and she left after about 45 minutes. 

Had other experiences too that I could go into detail of that get pretty odd. Moved house at about 13 and it stopped. Went to church one evening (a youth church event) with a friend and that night it came back. I've never been religious but felt a religious presence in the church that night. Got home and had a shadow lurking above me in bed that night. It was different this time. More ominous and lacked form. Like a black cloud with red eyes that felt way more evil. I denounced any religion saying I don't want to get involved and it subsided. Don't remember falling asleep but it must have left. 

Moved country at 18 and never had anything of that nature ever happen again. Really bizarre childhood and I'm still baffled as to wtf it was. Parents thought it was bullshit or nightmares till my father actually saw it throw a bucket of my toys at him when he ran in because I was screaming. It's still a really big question mark in my life. 

Edit: I could always move during these. Would also have thought it was sleep paralysis but I could always move, scream, or hide under covers. "

12123,"I think what often gets glossed over is that a lot of men who aren't outwardly emotional when interacting with women do it as a defense mechanism. Just like guys, girls can be cruel, and if you're going to be the one doing the approaching almost every time, you either commit to perpetual virginity or you learn to take rejection. And you can't get hurt if you don't make yourself vulnerable in the first place. 

I'm sure I'll sound kind of bitter here, and I'm not at all, but it's my experience that a lot of women will complain about men not putting themselves out there while simultaneously mocking them when they do put themselves out there. We know it happens - hell, I know girls that absolutely love to try and get me in on it - and the knowledge that you’re going to be laughed at after you get shot down doesn’t exactly make the process easier.

Rejection isn't a bad thing, but it still sucks if you have a lot invested in the outcome. Blocking out feelings and treating women as unimportant, or even as objects, is I think how a lot of guys learn to cope.

12138,"I’ve been stabbed twice (once by myself on accident but it was pretty deep so I count it) and shot once.

I was shot in the heel by my 9 year old nephew and it caught a chunk of bone and was actually the least painful of the three and it healed pretty nicely and overall was more of a nuisance than a major injury. the range had the first aid stuff to stop the bleeding and adrenaline masked the pain pretty well until I was to urgent care

the first time I got stabbed was when I was nine years old and too add on the the lifelong trauma it was on christmas day. my uncle who had recently gotten out of prison came to my grandmas house to try and participate in our family christmas or at least I believe that was his initial intention because he was so cracked up no one could tell what he was saying but he busted in the back door and pushed over my poor grandma and was screaming at my dad about drugs or hiding something I don’t recall but he grabbed my arm and stabbed me in the side just under my ripcage and I got very lucky he didn’t hit any vital organs, after he stabbed me my dad broke his jaw and called an ambulance, but I remember pulling the knife out because my 9 year old brain thought “the knife is causing the pain so if I pull it out the pain will stop” and so I lost a lot of blood and I felt really light and had like that hazy way things look when you dream and then I started to come back to in the ambulance and started freaking out because I left my dog at home alone and then I was in a hospital bed. I am no longer very fond of christmas 

the second time I stabbed myself was while I was doing dishes and one of the knifes was in the drain facing upward and I didn’t notice it while I was cleaning a pan and it put a hole clean through my hand between my thumb and pointer finger and I yelled really loudly and scared the shit out of my dog (the same dog I had when I was nine actually) "

This is the same logic that occurred when helmets were first introduced. Helmets being deployed directly corresponded with an increase in head injuries.

Some of my earliest memories are of me and my two older brothers exploring the dry woods around our house. One of my most VIVID memories of my life there is of us coming across a massive lake one day after spending hours out in the woods. We were maybe thirty minutes from our house as the crow flies, but had been exploring since sunrise. When we came across it we all got a bad feeling, and started trying to retrace our steps home immediately. As soon as we got home we told our parents and they told us we were silly. We tried going back and never found it, we moved several years later- but even to this day both of my older brothers have the same memory of us seeing this huge lake in the woods. But even after multiple return trips and an uncountable amount of google maps searches, we’ve never been able to find anything that could even be considered a pond- the nearest lake being thirty minutes down the interstate.

12270,"I was living with my brother and a hand full of room mates in a 3 bedroom apt when I was 17/18. The guy who held the lease(he was mid 20s this is important) was a super friendly, charismatic nerdy guy. One of those people who always offered to help and go the extra mile for you. He even covered a portion of my rent for a few months when I was broke. 

His girlfriend(16/17) also lived with us. Nice girl, but she was always anxious, making a fuss or argument over nothing, and generally seemed stressed 24/7 despite not having to do chores, work, or go to school. 

FF a few months, and suddenly they break up. Guy says he just couldn't do it anymore. One evening we're all playing a card game in the livingroom and she comes by to get her shit. She storms into the middle of it and goes ""Thanks for beating the shit out of me for all those years!"" or something along those lines. We initially just assumed she was trying to cause shit or turn us against him. Most of us stopped talking to her altogether. 

FF a few more months, and his next girlfriend pretty much confirms he was beating the shit out of his ex girlfriend. He started making threats to her when they were alone too. Saying he would do anything from hurt her, to make her pregnant if she tried to leave him. After she exposed him he had a social meltdown, kicked us all out (as his name was the only one on the lease) and proceeded to try and sleep with a number of my underaged female friends I had introduced him to. 

"
12271,"Then no bartender. Maybe the manager could step up and handle the bar for a day, I know the manager at my gf's restaurant will do that occasionally. It sounds like manager wasn't willing to step out and take one for the team for a day, or perhaps a server, at the cost of one of their best employees. 

I've met managers who refuse to do much at all, managers who meet the bullet points of their job and no more, and managers who care about the business, their employees, and their status as a fantastic leader and person. My gf's manager will step up to fill any holes necessary in the schedule, and would have suspended/fired the shit out of that other bartender afterwards. No one is fooled by ""my family surprised me."" Maybe they can surprise you with rent money because you'll need it. 

When you set a solid, consistent standard with rewards for meeting them/exceeding them, and punishment for violating them, you may see the usual turnover from bum employees (which are everywhere in the service industry), but you'll also slowly create a team that is consistently reliable. 

I worked as a bike delivery driver for Jimmy John's awhile back and my manager was a coke addicted prick, but he still gave raises for consistently good performance, and would tear you a new asshole if you didn't flow through the proper channels for days off.

12278,"I was 16 at the  time, and i had 3 managers, one was an old hag who complained about us being lazy while she ate free food.

A fuckboy who'd hit on all the girls and if any guy needed help he'd ignore it or give us busywork rather than help.

And another one who was nice but still up her own ass about power of managering.

My co-workers were either other 16 year olds or 30 year old junkies trying to get meth money.

We only worked for $8 an hour, $6 an hour after taxes so none of us even cared about doing a good job, literally none of us.

It started out with 20 new hires.

By week 1, 4 were gone.

Week 2, 6 were gone.

And by one month of awful managers, i just quit and didn't show up.

2 months after i started and 1 month after i quit i heard everyone who was a new hire eventually quit because Those bosses expected way too much from teenagers and junkies out of $6 an hour.

And the place even had to be investigated for drug deals inside the place, the fuckboy was a junkie who got caught selling drugs in the place.

I think pedophilia comes with wealth if you are a shitty person, its buying something that isn't on the market. I think pedos go to hollywood because many people are willing to exchange their kids innocence for a chance at a lifelong paycheck, regardless of the cost to the kid. Child actors get whatever they want until they are no longer children. Then they get 1000 slaps that life gives everyones, but instead of going through the slaps at a calm rate through school/high school they get one big hit and it fucks a lot of them up. 

War on Drugs was a cover to inject friendly yes men as leaders of small poor nations to guarantee good trade/positions for people in power. Weed was squashed by the paper industry in the early 1920's because hemp is a far superior product to wood for dozens of applications. Getting it snuffed out in the drug war was just convenient.

12418,"Most unsettling thing I've ever seen was actually on a relatively short trip, relatively close inland.  

We were on this big old catamaran of all things, just headed out on a day trip in the fall.  It was a quite cool fall day, raw, grey, and rainy on the coast of New England.  Actually, very rainy.  But the drink seemed calm enough from shore.

So about 200 landlubbers who don't normally do any boating cram onto the boat.  You've got about three levels inside, with a deck on the first, then another topside above.  And this thing normally whips at about 30 knots.

Anyways, we get out there a bit, and it gets rougher than it looked.  The boat's getting tossed around some.  I'm running around the deck and topside getting positively soaked by some of the heaviest rain I've been outside in.  Then I go inside.  

It was like what I imagine the fucking plague was like in the 1300s.  I mean, it looked like a scene out of some post-apocalypse movie where everyone got ebola or something.  Just dozens and dozens of people, all close to each other, not enough buckets, all at various stages of puking or having just puked.  Fucking vomit was everywhere.  The stench was totally unbearable.  People were just horking up bile by near the end of it.  The higher floors were no better.

Later, I went in and I was waiting to use the only other sink. The guy washing his hands looked disgusted and talked to me about the puke, not knowing it was me.

The diseases that are easy to cure have been cured. We are working on the rest. There would need to be a massive conspiracy between all pharma companies, universities, and hospitals to hide cures from the public

The biggest nail in the coffin is that big pharma collaborates pretty heavily with universities and hospitals where all the researchers have a lot more to personally gain by publishing the cures and catapulting themselves to the top of their field. "

12493,"Agree with everything you just said. “Employ term limits” seems to be the slightly wrong angle for solving the real problem, which is a lack of competitive elections. For example, it wouldn’t occur to Canadians to suggest term limits for MPs, since there are three major parties capable of winning many seats, and many elections tend to be waves that sweep dozens (hundreds in the last election) of incumbents from office.

Ranked-choice ballots are a must for giving voters more options, and possibly drawing districts to maximize competitiveness ([this](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/#Competitive) illustrates what I mean)"

Have you ever been in a situation where someone asked you to ""walk normally"" or do something in the way you normally do it? As soon as you start thinking about it, its hard to repeat what you normally do.

Also, even if you aren't aware, its hard to keep making exactly repetitive motions for long periods of time, both because it is painful and because one literally can't even if they are willing to push through the pain after a while. That's just how muscles work.

To ask 'what is a computer' in perfect English, having no trouble whatsoever using her computer, is to be among the most brain-dead members of society. Who would want that product after seeing that commercial? As far as I can tell that commercial is *intended* to make the target audience feel dumber, dumb as a rock, so that they'll go buy a simple computer. If that's the logic/philosophy behind this ad and if it worked I'll be so upset."
12503,"Here are some tricks I learned to have difficultil conversations with my husband is introverted and conflict avoident husband:

1. Add a mindless activity like walking, having a cocktail, or folding laundry. Activity has to be done together. It makes him feel like he isn't being accosted.

2. Ask him to create a spreadsheet or list or concoct a solution as a discussion aid so that he is engaging with data as well as emotion.

3. Let him take mini breaks. If he wants to talk about a spot on the wall for 30 seconds engage about that for a bit before redirecting. Its best to agree that the spot looks like a dog. He is trying to make sure you guys still agree about stuff.

-She was flooded with low-income, non-Christian kids because you could get a week of 9-5 babysitting for a $50 registration fee. I think the church was very aware of what it was doing and wanted to minister to kids.

-Camps were generally one week long, Monday to Friday, with a big church service the parents were expected to attend Friday evening (no overnights). The kids would do a play or something they had been working on, and the adults would get preached at and asked for money. 

-You can buy VBS kits online for like $1000. They are big, themed boxes (we did a Hollywood camp one year) that come filled with props and other crap, including all of the classes and lessons.

12556,"I'm from Canada;

I had heard horror stories about it taking 5+ years for a young family to get approved, with children, for a family doctor, so applying as an individual I expected to wait longer still. I was very surprised to receive the letter only 3 years later. 

The benefit of the Canadian system is that I never felt like not having my own ""family doctor"" for the 3 years I was waiting was preventing me from having access to quality care, as Hospitals and ERs are very welcoming of walk-ins and I've had a few minor things dealt with there, and of course there are free emergency walk-in clinics scattered about for convenience. 

As for the waiting time for care itself, I'm sure many Canadians will disagree with me, but I am more than happy to wait in a waiting room for hours, it doesn't bother me. Boring, sure, but it's necessary, when you have so many patients and so few doctors. 

I am not surprised to hear that people are skipping the border to the US to take advantage of buying their way to the front of the line, so to speak, but not many can really afford the expense, so I think the way things are is a good compromise.

Of course, waiting rooms are a special form of purgatory, and spending half a day in one to get stitches can drive one insane, but overall, the lack of the looming threat of bankruptcy I hear horror stories about in the states calms my nerves.

In short, when my taxes are being spent to save everyone else's lives, I sleep a little better at night, knowing that if anything happens to me, everyone else has my back too, and i'm never left to face these issues alone.

I got a sweet triple monitor setup, all IPS LG monitors, tiny bezels, the works. One day about 3 months down the road, one monitor got some red streaking along the side. Screenshots don't show it, so I know my other hardware is fine. No biggie, I figure, I take it back to where I bought it and swap it out.

Couple weeks later, the same thing happens to the other two monitors, so I call LG and let them know the situation. Maybe my store got a bad batch. They replace the two bad monitors, easy peasy, all under warranty. The two replacements arrive and have the SAME ISSUE out of the box. 

I call LG back, they stonewall me, say it's probably my fault. I finally get through to someone after an hour or two of arguing, and my this point, I just want my money back. I finally get return shipping labels to send all three (mind you, one of them is still working okay) back to LG.

A month goes by and I don't hear a peep. No refunds, no nothing. I call LG again. They lost all three monitors. Mind you, the tracking shows all three were delivered, so they're lost in an LG warehouse somewhere. I complain my way to a manager and relay my tale. He finds them in the system somehow, hears that there's a perfectly working monitor somewhere in his warehouse, and pitches a fit. Not at me thankfully, at whoever processed the return for the three monitors. He does whatever magic he needs to do and a week later I get my refund.

LG's hardware is shit. Their customer support is shit. If not for that one manager, I'd probably still be trying to get my $650, years down the road. I will never buy anything from LG again."

Step 1: Create posting on any darknet market under the counterfiet currency category something like ""100% real bills, possibly monitored"".

Step 2: Sell all of your found money for untraceable cryptocurrecy (only accept Monero or an equivalent). If you care about being extra secure run it through a tumbler.

Step 3: Sell your crypto on an overseas exchange

Step 4: Transfer your earnings to your bank account and declare it and pay your short term capital gains tax on your ""big win"".

This prevents location detection because you'll be mailing the currency all across the world with no meaningful link.

Sure, you'll end up with like 50% of your starting value, but if you want to launder hot bills where there's a will there's a way. "

12713,"If I don’t know them at all, I’m usually a bit uncomfortable or more so nervous/wary?
I’d say the best advice is to do one of two things:

1. Don’t hang around after. This makes it seem like you’re trying to get something out of it rather than just giving a compliment. Approach her and just say “I hope this doesn’t come off uncomfortable, but I just thought you should know you look beautiful today.” And then you’re done, walk away. Any interaction like that has either left me flattered, or at worst case scenario thinking the guy was maybe a bit awkward but I never felt threatened. 

2. Compliment specific things they can change rather than calling them gorgeous. Compliment her scarf or her outfit or how she did her hair or makeup. These always come off significantly less sexually-aimed then any general comment on a woman’s looks, or on comments about things they couldn’t change (legs, butt, lips, etc.)"

12756,"Swore I wanted to go to a film school out of high school. Applied to Full Sail in Orlando, Florida. They require half of the tuition upfront ($22,000). I went for a tour of the school and was dazzled by the cool neon lights and film sets. I look out a loan with Sally Mae and began school. After the second semester I realized it wasn't for me. While it is a bachelors degree, its not like you can change your major and readjust to your newly realized interests. I ended up miserable and dropping out in the first days of the second semester. I still owed $22,000 regardless if I dropped out or not. I decided to drop now and save myself from spending another $22,000 in the second year. To rub salt in the wound, absolutely none of the credits earned at Full Sail were eligible to transfer to other universities-- $22,000 and nothing to show for it. 

That was ten years ago and I finished paying off the loan thank god. I joined the military and worked hard to pay off that loan, I took advantage of education benefits and worked on an actual bachelors degree, graduated, and then completed a masters program from a great University in Florida near where I was stationed. I've got a great job now doing something I love.  I've redeemed myself, but it was certainly a learning experience. "

It was literally out of nowhere. We had all heard this story a million times before (and have seen the pictures) so we just kind of nodded along. A few minutes later, the wait staff came out to give the bday girl a piece of cake and to sing happy birthday. Literally during the last part of the song, annoying friend turns to me and says “Squirrel, did you see the picture of me dancing on the bar??” and shoved the phone in my face.

12801,"I've answered this before!

I grew up in the country, and my family owns several hundreds if acres of land. We were a dairy family, so most of that land was wooded and untamed. My cousins and I would go hunting on our property- deer, rabbit, and fowl were plentiful, including wild turkey.

When I was about twelve, my cousin, just a few months younger than myself, and I decided to go hunt some turkey. We made our way about three or four miles away from our homes, managing to pick up turkey tracks eventually.

So I'm the lead, and my cousin decides to do... *fucking something* and discharged his rifle as I was tracking ahead, filling my thigh and hip with birdshot.

It feels like nothing for the .005 seconds it takes you to realize that you've been shot. Then it's like that part of your body has been plunged into an ice bath until the blood starts to gush out of your body in a hot, wet flow. Your first instinct is to grab your wounds until your own fingers slip inside the new holes in your flesh and you feel yourself *inside*  your own meat.

I could feel my heartbeat in my head and with every new pulse of blood that dribbled down my body.

All I could think was, *""I've been shot I've been shot I've been shot I'm going to die in the middle of the forest.""*

My cousin immediately started screaming, sobbing, then puked. And then I realized that I *really* was going to die in the woods if it was up to this fuckin' kid. So I crawled my way over to him, pushed him over and demanded his tee-shirt and his gun.

I wrapped my leg, confiscated his gun, then had to walk out of the woods with my useless cousin trailing behind me, crying.

I never went hunting with another person ever again.

The cousin went on to get a fishing hook stuck in his shoulder because he tried to pull his line out of some bushes instead of untangling it like a normal outdoorsman, so there's that."

12814,"I am Ojibwe. When people in the past faced Starving-Times due to crop failure/drought, or tribal warfare etc-people who had no other choice would eat the dead out of absolute desperation. People would go mad from starvation before they finally did this. As you can imagine, it was deeply shameful for survivors. After the Starving-Time, no one in the community wanted to discuss it, what they had to do to survive.  
  
For our people, the Wendigo legend originated with these experiences. The Wendigo was a euphemism, an ACTUALIZATION of the survivors emotions during and after the Starving-Time, wherein the urge to eat became all-consuming of a person's spirit. That the maddening hunger possessed them to such an extent that it would cause them to eat the community's dead.  
  
Instead of discussing their actual feelings about the cannibalism that was caused by starvation, the story of the Wendigo began. It continued to shape in retelling for centuries and centuries since time immemorial between different Ojibway communities.
  
So picture the Wendigo. A huge, towering spirit that walked the bush. It's power was so great, that it knocked down trees as it moved. It came to life every winter, especially after drought. When the People could not store enough food in spring, summer and fall-for winter.  
  
 When the communities crops had failed. When the forest had been dry as tinder, and no berries and roots could grow. When the fishing had been poor because the fish were not running in the streams. When the hinting was poor because animals starved. Because animal-mothers could not eat enough and they did not produce milk for their babies and the babies died, and the mothers starved. When even the beavers the Land left because the streams dried up and because the birch trees withered.  
  
That was when the Wendigo came to the Land to torment the People. It followed them through the bush as they searched for food, until they could go no further. The Wendigo then ran down the People. Possessed the People. Made them mad with hunger and lust for food of any kind. Made them so evil and mad that they would eat the dead. The Elders. The children. And if the Wendigo entered you, you also became a Wendigo. You could then possess others to become Eaters of the Dead as well.

As Dr. Redfield explains, Evan made up those alternate realities as a means to cope with the guilt of having killed Kayleigh.  That is the only true timeline, and the others are all imaginary.  That sounds like a bullshit ""it was all a dream"" answer.  I recognize that, but please allow me to explain with a wall-of-text why I think it deserves a pass.

It's worth first mentioning that Evan dies only in the director's cut.  I would imagine that this is how the movie was meant to end, with safer alternatives made in the interest of marketing.

-

---

-

If you watch the film with the commentary on, it becomes apparent that the directors put a great deal of effort into maintaining consistency with certain details, enough to where an obvious plot hole would seem too big to go unnoticed.  They set up this elaborate story, only to mess up their own rules for the basis of how it all works?

Instead, I believe that they intended for Evan's illogical solution for escaping prison to be a hint that there was more to the movie than what it seemed, and that they didn't want to just spell it out.  Given the significant difference between the theatrical happy ending and [the far more disturbing director's cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wSH1SpQh9c), I wouldn't be surprised if they had planned for there to be something else in the film that would have made the ""mistake"" out to be a more definitive piece of the plot.

-

The real timeline is the one that is shown at the beginning (and end) of the movie.

* Evan suffers frequently from either aneurysms or seizures.

* Evan never met his father, or heard anything to the effect that he could change the past.  The only time Jason is mentioned to young Evan is when Andrea says that it's ""too dangerous for [Jason]"" to not be where he is.

* Young Evan draws the picture of himself stabbing the two Nazis.

* Young Evan lights the stick of dynamite and directly causes Kayleigh's death.

* Evan grows up in an institution, both for his own safety and as a consequence of his actions.

* Dr. Redfield tells Evan they've gone over the fact numerous times that there are no journals.

At some point early on the day that he dies (in the director's cut), he has an aneurysm\seizure.  This is when he ""wakes up"" in the institution, believing that he just killed Kayleigh a moment earlier.  In his mind, it just happened a second ago.

When he confronts Dr. Redfield, we in the audience reject the doctor's explanation as quickly and with as much frustration as Evan does.  We think, ""He's not crazy.  He really can change the past.  Why doesn't the doctor believe him?""

Think about the film as being more of a drama than it is science-fiction.  That moment is what makes this theory so amusing to me.  By that point, The Butterfly Effect has already sold us on accepting everything from Evan's point of view as being factual, including his logic that he could convince Carlos of his ability by going back and scarring the palms of his hands.

There are some other details that benefit the theory in that regard, but I'm impressed that you're still reading and will skip over them.

Prior to the final moments of the film, we see Dr. Redfield discussing Evan's earlier trauma with Andrea.

&gt;  The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.

Later that same evening, Evan breaks into the doctor's office to watch home movies.  He has a fatal aneurysm\seizure right there under the doctor's desk, and whichever ending you like most -- [there are actually a couple different endings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8zO9rDKmyA) -- is just what is going on in Evan's head as he dies.  For the director's cut, he dreams about how perfect everyone's lives are going to be after he prevents himself from being born.

-

**tl;dr** What we see in The Butterfly Effect is Evan's flawed memory of events, and there is only one actual timeline.  We're talking about someone who has had severe neurological damage and also grown up with little access to the outside world.  He is mentally unstable, and the older he gets, the more irrational his line of thinking becomes.  The plot hole is his ""memory"" of escaping from prison.  In actuality, it may have been a deliberate illustration of how he simply wasn't able to think clearly by the time he was an adult.  As the doctor says, he's surprised Evan still has use of his motor functions following the most recent aneurysm\seizure.

Pessimism is going to kill the beer industry. It's shocking how bad it's gotten. You can see it all the time in any beer subreddit. No one can just be happy about beer.

It's impossible for us to just make a good beer. Every IPA is just a member of a bandwagon, every lager isn't as good as x, every stout is a gimmick. I'm fucking sick of it. I just want to make beer.

It's this reverse phenomenon of the reverse circlejerk. In some ways, it's always been part of the ""scene:"" everyone thought the craft beer bubble would burst, it did in the nineties, and since then everyone acts like we're on the edge of another. I have an article from 2006 asking ""When will the Craft beer bubble burst again?"" And it still hasn't happened and every three months some asshole writing for a food magazine writes about it. I'm fucking sick of it.

And the worst is the ""recommenders"" who come in and whine about our American styles and ask why we can't make a Kolsch/hefeweizen/cream ale and then we make it and *no one buys it*.

My favorite kind of beer drinker is the kind who can sit down with any beer, enjoy it, maybe critique it a bit, and not act like every beer I brew is a comment on the industry signaling the end of beer as we know it."

12985,"I'm not a big enough hypocrite to warn you away from drugs, but maybe consider psychedelics instead if you haven't already.

They're less easy to fall into abusing, and a nice strong trip is far more of an 'event' than nodding off on opiates.  I'm going out on a limb by assuming your experiences are similar to mine, but I already have 'good' days.  What I lack are *interesting* days, because it's so damn hard to give much of a shit about what's going on around me.

Once every three months the little sacred fungus provides a day far more interesting than even those without depression usually get to experience.

12989,"While you guys might find it hard to understand, where i live, crime is high and the police force is kind of weak, so ordinary people joined forces to help the local police. Sooner than later we started using dirty tactics on other gangs/criminals, like violence and such. And we techincally became a 'gang', whilst it is common that we still help the police, we also work for money. So we and the police have an unwritten agreedment, that is along the lines ""you let us do our thing and protect our family, we will help them with criminals and gangs. I wont discuss my involment in this 'gang'. But we commonly used to execute people and rob gang holdouts. How it would work was the police told us the gang member/criminal and if/when we found them, a 'capture team' would be sent out when they caught the guy, we would ask him if he were rather to be handed to the police to investigate his innocence or if he wanted freedom in exchange for money, now since only a couple people knew this trick here, we would convince them that we are no longer willing to kill but are money hungry. If they chose freedom, theye were executed on the spot. A messenger would tell the police the body location and that it was us, and 97% of the time police would immediatly  classify it as a cold case. Getting out wasnt really hard, as this 'gang' was preety much volenteer work, as well some officers joined the gang. When i left, the others told me if i needed protection from people trying to harm me or my fiancee to just hit them up. We still keep good relations.

As I’m walking in I hear, “yo, who you representin’” by some young girl, turn my head and notice shes walking towards me. At first I was afraid because there had been a large number of brutal attacks a few towns away because of the color of the shirt but I hadnt thought about what I was wearing because I just grabbed what was on the top of the drawer. I just kind of snarkily answered, “NASA.... like the space agency..... like science.....” I could tell this girl had literally never heard of NASA before and she stopped and stood there looking at me with this oddly confused face. I stared back at her for a few seconds and shrugged my shoulders and walked away calmly even though I was dying a little bit inside. "

13016,"17 years ago on a carnival cruise, my dumb 17 year old self decided to do karaoke on the ship, to none other than ""It's gonna be me"" by Nsync. As I was totally nailing the breakdown, three drunk older women came up and started dancing behind me very sexually. 

My parents thought it was hysterical because I had a look on my face like I was shocked, embarrassed and disgusted, all while singing justin timberlake's part. 

There was this group of 3 girls my age in the front row laughing and eye-flirting with me as I sang. The song ended, *everyone clapped*, and I went back to my family's table, I looked over but the girls were gone. 

A the communal dinners they have on cruise ships, we were seated with another family with a son about my age. After dinner, he and I went to the night club on the ship for ""Teen night"". As he sat in the booth trying to pretend to smoke ciggarrettes he somehow bought on the boat, he refused to come dance and talk to girls as he was ""Waiting on a slow song"". 

Rather than try to explain that they don't play songs like that here, I bailed and went to the dance floor, walking right into the group of three girls I performed for earlier. 

I have/had no idea how to dance but just did what I could, pulling out moves I had seen as the ""move of the day"" from MTVs Cisqo's shakedown. It seemed to be working. Two of the girls were sisters,  one my age and one a year older, and one of their friends that was my age as well from northern California. 

We all ended up hanging out the rest of the trip, I won a bottle of wine somehow on the cruises game show, I won the pingpong tournament, and basically had three chicks to hang out with. Looking back I must have just done everything right because I was this kid who sang karoke, was okay with dancing, managed to get booze as a minor on a cruise ship, was great at pingpong, and generally really fun. 

I got the younger sisters number and we kept contact on AIM, myspace, and then face through the years. We would talk every few years about college, working life, etc. But hadn't talked recently in probably about 5 years. 

Four years ago, I was in northern California sitting by the hotel pool drinking beer on a work trip and messaged her, ""Hey can I call you.""  That was September of 2014.  I moved to California in February 2015, proposed at the pride parade in 2016 and we got married this past march. 

And yes, at our wedding the last song we played was ""It's gonna be me.""

13029,"I've told this story to a lot of my friends because it always comes up that they have never pooped their pants before. I call them liars, it escalates... 

So once upon a time I'm helping my boyfriend move out of his wretched house with one of my friends. This place had like no doors, the windows had half duct taped squares of cloth pushed up against them, rodents, bugs, if you were going to use the bathroom make sure to say hi to the local drug dealer. It's incredibly hot outside even for the south, and we're all suffering. Halfway through the day we go to have a quick bite to eat and sit in the AC. We go to a local chain that I've eaten at a thousand times before with no problem. I get chicken fingers because I didn't have much money, and honestly I wasn't that hungry to begin with because it was so hot. They were slightly cold on the inside, but they're chicken fingers - probably reheated.

My judgement was not good that day.

A few hours later my stomach makes the sound of Satan while I'm taking a break on the couch. Weird, I think. Then it makes it again; my friend is alarmed and asks if that was me or the cat. In my head I'm coming to the realization that I'm about to have a monstrous episode of butt trench, and there's no way I can do it with no doors, no windows... probably making full eye contact with someone else, be it neighbor or friend. I tell my friend and boyfriend we have to get the fuck out of there. I give no explanation; it was my car, we were leaving, we were going to my boyfriends new house and I was going to ruin that bathroom.

We get there, and his roommate is in the bathroom brushing her hair. No, she won't leave. No, it's going to take more than 30 minutes. My insides are writhing around and I know I don't have the time benefit of arguing. I grab my friend and we leave. I book it all the way to her house, and when we get there she makes eye contact with me. I know the answer is no to going into her house and doing what I'm about to do. 

My parents will hear!
God is going to hear, I think, and just leave.

Luckily, she lives half a mile from my house. Unluckily, I'm not going to make it. I lived in a very, very rural part of my state, and this was during the time the movie Signs came out. That movie scared me to death. I grew up in cornfields, I was scared of aliens.. it was a perfect storm as I pulled off to the side of the road near my neighbors house and ran into their cornfield in the hopes of some privacy and unleashed hell. I'm crying in shame and horror because I am sure in my newly deranged state that an alien is going to kill me or that my neighbor is going to come out and shoot me or see me (he had those automatic lights that turn on, so of course that's already popped on like a beacon of shame). What came out of me could only be described as punishment lava. It was terrible. After about ten minutes I calmed down and wiped with a corn husk and left. God knows what my neighbor thought when he came outside the next day (the running joke between everyone was 'did a fucking bear come through here?).

I felt dizzy and shaken. I sat in the car for a few moments, ashamed, and then started the .2 mile drive back to my house. On a dirt road. A very bumpy dirt road that was used as practice for snow plowing. I made it within 100 feet of my house, and then I learned that you cannot stop some things in life. They're going to just happen, and that night the 'just happen' was me shitting my pants. It wasn't long or drawn out, it was just 'suddenly poop' in my pants. I parked my car and sat there, crying again, because my early to bed parents were both awake and sitting there, staring at my car, at me crying in my /light blue pants/.

My mom came outside, I peeled myself away from the car and didn't look back. I waddled inside to her cry of 'what's wrong?' that didn't happen twice because she could see what had happened to me. I waddled past my dad, who looked up briefly, and said without a hint of care 'Well, it happens to the best of us.' and went back to reading his paper. I think spent 10 hours on the toilet having the worst salmonella poisoning of my life.

I don't like cold food anymore. Not ice cream. Not salads. I also only buy cars with leather seats, because there are some things you can't clean out of a car.

TLDR: Shit happens whether you want it to or not."

Snape is a genuinely awful person. Maybe his dad was abusive, maybe he got in with the wrong crowd, he's still a pathetic bully. But, because he loved someone, he risked his life to protect the person he hated the most.

For the righteous and the kind, doing good is as natural as breathing. But to do the right thing, when it defies every facet of your character and personality, there's a strength in that. People aren't perfect, and more often than not they're not even gonna be decent, so there's a lot to connect with when it comes to Snape.

That caught my attention because (a) Aang didn't really seem like he'd be that kind of a parent, and (b) wouldn't Katara, a person who historically has never put up with people's nonsense, catch on and call Aang out on it?

And what of Zuko? If he knew, he'd be *pissed* at Aang because that sort of thing would no doubt remind him of how Ozai was to him and Azula.

But, Bumi did have a great quote in LoK about it all:

* You'll suddenly develop an affinity for late night Charley Horses and going to the bathroom multiple times a night.

* For some of you, mowing the lawn used to be a nice time to get some sun and wave at the neighbors. Now, its a time you dread. You look forward to when its too hot to go outside, because that also means its too hot for the fucking grass to grow. Your knees are dust, and you can swear it wasn't this hard last year. It wasn't. You're old.

* You'll hear the AC kick in, even at night, and start to mentally tally up all the electricity that you're using. You'll hear a deafening creak every time someone touches the thermostat. You know its not there, but you hear it all the same, even over your tinnitus.

* You'll suddenly want to start building a deck. We don't know how it happens. But right around 40, I wanted to build decks everywhere, and my house has almost no elevation at all.

 But the worst, THE WORST, is yet to come.

* There will be a day when you, having been able to successfully flirt with women of all ages up until now, will be greeted with a single word whose meaning will change from one moment to the next: 

""Sir"".

You'll see a young 20-something in the grocery store and you'll smile, and you'll start to open your mouth to say something nice, just a small, meaningless flirt. A way to pass the time.

13137,"Air pollution control engineer here. I'm the guy enforcing these rules (both for my state and the federal stuff). This comment is more than a little misleading. 

Generally, a rule will require some sort of emissions limit. Say less than 1 pound per hour. We will include that limit in a company's permit, and also include a testing requirement to back it up. So, the company will pay an independent third party to come out and test their actual emissions to demonstrate compliance. This testing is done by following EPA's published reference test methods, and according to a testing protocol we have approved. We also often witness these tests being done (i.e. I go out there and watch the guy take the samples). 

From there, the permit will have some sort of monitoring that is required to demonstrate that continuous compliance is happening. A good example is temperature - during the emissions test your temperature was 500 degrees and you met the emission limit, so your permit says you have to keep your temperature at at least 500 degrees. They'll be required to record that somehow, and then periodically send a report showing us that they met the requirement. 

Of course if you're an enterprising business owner, you could go through the effort of fabricating all of your records in an effort to pull one over on me. Enter the other half of my job, which is inspecting your company and making sure you aren't doing that. It's a lot more obvious than people think it is, and if you submit false information to me you can wind up in jail. "

Plus they took breaks, including long lunch breaks, often. Over the last several decades, the amount of work that the average worker produces for the average company has grown exponentially. Meanwhile, wages have stayed pretty flat, although inflation has not. I believe this is all a huge contributing factor to how the rich have gotten FAR richer than anyone else in the U.S.  I don't know what we can DO about it, but I would say it will only get worse from here..."

13203,"I don't know really. It's hard to say. She makes conversation constantly wherever she goes and generally seems satisfied with it. She's probably one of the least isolated people I've ever seen in that she doesn't have any apparent fear or embarrassment about  socialising with anyone she likes the look of. Is she forming the kind of connections with people that would satisfy my own desire for human company? I have no idea and I'm not sure it's fair to assume that her experience is less interesting or satisfying because her ability to communicate and comprehend isn't as extensive. I'm guessing she wouldn't do it if she didn't get anything out of it.

She never appears unhappy and she seems to enjoy her chats with people. She's independent enough to travel about without assistance. I don't think we can assume that people with an intellectual disability must be sad and feel bad because they aren't necessarily able to do all the things you and I are. 

I think there's often an assumption that a higher level of intelligence or intellectual capacity is automatically a better state to be in, and it definitely does have advantages, but I don't believe it automatically equates to a happier, more rewarding life. I don't think people are less lonely for having a higher IQ.

Maybe Shouting Mandy feels a loneliness that she can't really explain and doesn't have the capacity to try and remedy. But maybe she spends her days having conversations with all sorts of people about all sorts of things and doesn't feel like she's missing out on anything at all. I've got no idea, and I don't know if she could tell me even if I were to ask her.

As it is she chats to people on busses and the people of the city she lives in are kind enough to chat with her and to keep an eye out for her. Nobody wants to get cornered by Shouting Mandy but nobody would let her come to harm either.

Is ignorance bliss? Probably not. But I don't reckon it automatically has to be misery either."

13215,"Ok, here's two, one of which happened to me, one to my cousin:

On 9/11 my cousin was a middle school kid, and was a few blocks from the WTC. He was going to work with his mom that day. 

Right after the first plane hit he and his mom saw a guy get out of a cab, stand on the sidewalk for a minute looking at the tower, then open his wallet, take out the cash, and toss the wallet into a trash bin. He threw his briefcase away too, and took of his tie and threw it away, and walked away from the towers waving for a cab. He got in and drove away. 

They never talked about that for years, it would upset my aunt. They do now. The leading theory is he worked there and took the chance to just get out. I don't know. But they both saw him throw his stuff away and walk away. My cousin had no idea what was going on, but it dawned on him years later what had happened. 

The second thing happened to me. My sister and I went to Disney World with two twentyish sibling neighbors when I was a kid. We got pulled over. The girl who was driving got out and the cop pushed her up against the car and put his hand under her shirt for a long time, then under her skirt, while he sort of lectured her on safe driving. They were right outside my window so I could hear him and sort of see what he was doing, but it didn't make much of an impression on me at the time. I remember a car went by and honked at him and he waved to them as he groped her. It went on for a long time, fifteen minutes or so, then he let us go. 

She got back in and her brother said ""Better than getting a ticket,"" and she said ""Fuck you Tommy"" and drove us home. "

13317,"I'm kind of hitting the borderline of relevance with this story but I'm going to tell it anyway.

Back in the day my dad had a company that rented out 4x4 vehicles to foreigners who wanted to explore rural Africa. These cars were kitted out for offroading and rarely broke down. But this time one did. My dad had to retrieve the vehicle as hes done a few times before, and since we lived in the neighboring country It wasn't more than a 20 hour drive (We live in Cape Town, South Africa and the vehicle broke down in Namibia.)

To my delight my dad was setting off to retrieve this 4x4 in the upcoming school holiday and asked me to join him. I should add that I was about 16 at the time and ghost stories never really got to me. So we set off on our long journey and the trip goes smoothly as planned. We get to the collection point, hook up the broken down 4x4 to ours and off we go, no problems at all... Until it turned dark. Now I know Namibia quite well, it has some well known ghost stories, ghost towns and other Erie occurrences have been reported, but in my mind that was just fantasy.

Fast forward to about 2:30 am (remember kids, nothing good ever happens after 2am) and my dad wakes me up with noticeable uneasiness in his voice. He asked me to look in the rear view mirror and tell me what I see. I looked in the mirror and noticed two dim headlights almost on our rear bumper that appear to be bouncing around a bit. My dad told me he wanted to make sure I see it too and it isn't just his tired eyes playing tricks on him. I looked around and the area we were in was terrifying to say the least. We were surrounded by hills, but because of the lack of light it was just pure blackness against the night sky, covered in leafless trees with pointy sharp branches all over.

I ask my dad where we were and he simply said that he doesn't know, hes just been following the gps and asked me to look if there were any towns near. There wasn't, not for more than 300 kilometers.He pointed back at the mirror and said ""look"". He then proceeded to shift over the center of the road to the other lane and the lights followed suit without hesitation, as if they were tied to us. I asked my dad what it was and he said that he thinks its a truck, now that in itself is not totally uncommon on these long cross country roads but something about this just seemed off.

I mentioned to my dad that the truck may simply want to pass us, we are pulling quite a bit of weight so we are way under the speed limit at this point and he could be impatient. Dad decides to slow down to 60km/h and moves into the yellow line in an attempt to get this truck to pass. Nope, truck slows down too. Okay lets take it down a notch, dad slows down to 40km/h. Nope same result. We had to drop down to a speed of 20km/h for this truck to start overtaking us. And then it did...

We heard a groan and the grinding of gears and what seemed like an eternity till this truck started pulling up next to us. Now keep in mind these are quite windy roads with hills, so overtaking isn't recommended, especially not that slow, but this truck took its sweet time until it was right next to us. It was one of those car hauling trucks that has two levels that it can carry cars on. It had chains all over the sides that were slowly clinging and clanging through the night. The back of the truck where the cars get loaded appeared bent out of shape and the metal was rusted and held together by pieces of wood and loose torn pieces of fabric were blowing in the wind. I was terrified. I shifted my attention to the cabin, black as the sky that night and no driver in sight. I'm not making this up, we saw nobody.

The truck pulled in front of us with a groan and it didn't seem like it could speed up any more. Now we were behind this terrifying mess of a vehicle and my dad started getting impatient, we started overtaking the truck and checked again for life inside the cabin as we passed. Nothing. Once we were in front of the truck I noticed the headlights getting ever dimmer and dimmer, and when we picked up speed so did it. The lights kept dimming until there was but a spark left. This is where I got convinced something supernatural was going on. We were driving on a hillside and a bend was coming up, not a tight one, but if missed one would go straight off the road and down the hill as there were no barriers.We go around the bend slowly, considering our heavy load and the truck just goes straight without hesitation. We both saw it drive straight off the road and down the hill where at the bottom it finally got to a stop and all the lights died.

We stopped at a rest stop for the night and head back there that morning to have a look if anyone was hurt or if the truck was there. It wasn't and there were no tracks or broken bushes where we saw it go off the road."

13322,"So...I worked as a carer in u.k in Sheffield, I'd worked in care for well over a year at this point so was pretty well trained and used to the work by now.
In a care jobn you see people die, or people who have died and the first person to know was a carer so death isn't anything I was particularly scared off as it's a natural course of life.

Our company started with a new care package for a lady,  we were a big company at the time so we had lots of cares and lots of clients which sadly meant the same careers didn't necessarily see the same clients day in day out. But with new management they were trying to stub this out and get some continuity to the care.

So if only ever been to this last a couple times a week usually in the morning or at lunch, I'd been rostered on for the whole week all 4 visits (morn, lunch,tea,bed)
So morning went well. Everything was fine her house was lovely albeit abit to big for her seeing as though she lived in the living room and kitchen, her bed was downstairs and so was a commode (which we emptied upstairs in one of the bathrooms).
 On a routine bed call usually consists, for this lady, washing, using commode,cuppa tea, into nighty, into bed.
So after everything was done we made sure to empty the commode upstairs.
So I went through the living room and opposite is a basement that's under the stairs, the first thing I noticed is it was unlocked and slightly open.
Now I wouldn't think anything of it, but this lady lives alone can't walk without help, nor does she have any family to visit her and all are friends are sadly dead. I'm the only person she has seen all day as I've been on her rota for the entire day.

I shut the door lock it (with the bolt), then continue through the hall to get up the stairs, it's pitch black because it's winter and it's dark at 6pm, I switch the lights on as I go, I stop at the first step and look to the top, it's weird....I start to feel a pricking in the air almost like static, and I have a sense of impending doom at the bottom of my stomach.
I have to go up because this commode needs emptying so I run up the stairs (trying so hard not to spill the commode) and head straight to he end of the hall and I to the bathroom, empty it out turn the light off, shut the door, once I shut it, I heard a thud, almost like a body falling, me thinking the worst I run downstairs and make sure the last hasn't fallen out of bed.
She hadn't but her arm chair had moved closer to the bed almost locking the door Into the kitchen.
Now I 100% I locked that door when I came in I always do so noone can come in.
I move the chair back to where it was and it was almost like there was something shoving it, it was difficult to move but its never usually like this.
The lady turns to me and says ""oh no dear you can leave it there Harold likes to sit there""

I just sort of stop not thinking I heard her right, I know her husband was called Harold.
So I left it as she said and rather quickly made my way out the house.

When locking the door I distinctly heard a male voice and the lady laughing ...
I never went back in the house.

Formatting on mobile is ass so I'm sorry in advance and fucking BE NICE TO ME cause thinking about this still freaks me the fuck out

So it's my sophomore year of college and I move into a house with some friends from high school and college, moving from a regional campus to friends at the main campus, I had no chance to be inside the house or check out the vibes but up until this point, I didnt think houses could really be 'haunted' per se

We move in, shit is cool for a while, although almost immediately I begin having VIVID nightmares. Dark things, dark symbolism, pentagrams, winged beasts, dark figures speaking languages I had never heard. Like things were feeding on my most deeply laden fears, and compounding them into these cocktails that would leave me skipping class in an attempt to chill the fuck out. 

All the meanwhile, I begin to hear things, similar to whispers. I called then diagonal whispers because it was almost like they traveled around you, and you couldn't even really tell if they were happening. An odor began to inhabit the house that I had never smelled before and didnt understand.. this odor i later learned to be rotting meat. This and the whispers began to make me question if they were real, if it was in my head, and if it was stress. While others noted the stench, there was nothing else noted by the others.

A few months in, with nothing than the nightmares, my friend and I decide it would be fine to take some high quality lsd we got our hands on in the house as well felt 'safe'.

After spending some time upstairs, I decide water is necessary for us to continue and I head downstairs. 

I describe this next feeling as a feeling I have only felt in situations like this, and as a feeling that shakes me deeper than anything I can think of. I felt like I was being stalked, hunted, and watched like something was hungry. This was the first time I felt the hair 'tingles'. It was like, someone was breathing on my head. I turned around to nothing and brushed  it off as being under the influence. I looked to the counter and saw a little container and as I looked at it, as all stuff was, it started to move slowly and change colors. 

I was fascinated by such and continued to watch, prolly for a few minutes. I then noticed this dark figure in my right peripheral. If you've ever taken acid, everything is moving and warping (if visuals are strong) but what stood out was that nothing about this figure was moving. All the space and 'energy' I was perceiving was warping around this figure, and as soon as I looked directly, it evaporated. I quickly grabbed water and returned to my friend.

From this point on, I felt the 'hair tingles' consistently. Most consistently when alone in the house. I would sit in the living room and watch someone or something duck behind the stairway, watching me, as I was alone. I once watched a hand that I can only describe as the definition of 'the uncanny valley' wrap around the handrail of the stairway, with the 'body' or whatever it was attached to, hidden behind the wall. This started to escalate to the point where being in the house alone was terrifying. Like a hunt and you are the prey. I began spending as little time in and around the house as possible. 

One night I had to sleep in my room, and I was sleeping facing up. As I was asleep, a face I can describe as the most disturbing face I have ever seen, appeared in my dream and in the deepest raspiest most guttural attempt at human speech I have ever heard, it said 'RISE'. I felt the breath and oxygen leave my body as I sat up feeling like someone or something removed the air from my lungs. I see nothing, but then hear 'hey' in a diagonal whisper to see a tall dark figure in the corner, watching. My entire body filled with dread and I tried to look away.

I have always been religious and commanded the entity out and grabbed the bible under my pillow but as soon as I looked again, it was gone. 

At this point, I am at any cost looking to get out of the house. Breaking the lease was a full months rent (2750) and I couldn't afford it, so I did all I could and waited. A few weeks later, my girlfriend came over and had to go to the bathroom, and as I was watching TV, I heard her scream. I went to her as she was just exiting the bathroom and she began to tell me how as she was washing her hands, a black entity appeared behind her and when she ran for the door it held the door shut for a few seconds, keeping her in.

My girlfriend had believed me up until this point, but now she understood.

The 5 weeks following I had probably spent a total of 30 minutes in the house, all of it during the day time. I attempted to cleanse the house myself, but after two attempts, I gave up as I didnt think it was safe to attempt it alone. 

I finally moved out and never looked back. That place was fucked up, and that thing wanted to hurt and feed. That shit is REAL and I am glad I got out before anything worse happened. My heart goes out to anyone that has ever dealt with a manifestation of a demon because it was a kind of terrifying that truly is unlike anything else.

13348,"Lol at the hoaxes that riddled all the game forums when this game came out. Bigfoot, UFOs, various serial killers, ghosts. The game manual even said that there were ghosts that are rumoured to appear in the abandoned desert town at a certain time of night. Plus those UFO sightings maps that appear in some places, the game itself pretty much promoted the idea of these myths. 

There was even a myth that a rapist stalked the country towns, and if you went certain places at night, he would tackle CJ from behind and graphically rape him. "

Their reasoning was that this user asked shittymorph if he was the guy who used to post long comments that ended with his dad beating him with jumper cables, bc jumper cable comments vanished right about the time the hell in a cell comment started. Shittymorph said ""you found me,"" or ""you got me"" and or something like that. Dude took a screenshot and then moments later shittymorph deleted the comment.

13365,"Could write a book about this but there are already many. Some basic methods:

1) Stock readings / Barnum phrases. Sound very accurate and personal but everyone thinks so!

2) Cold reading. A mixed bag of picking up information about someone based on their appearance, accents, vocab, and so on. Tends not to be super specific but can hit sometimes.

3) Hot reading. This is where you actually know things about people. Done through googling, stalking Facebook, info submitted when applying for tickets (for a theatre show), and anywhere and everywhere else possible.

4) Moving on from misses, focusing on hits. You can cycle back to previous things the sitter has said and make them seem new. If you get a nice helpful sitter you can twist their answers into a hit. Many sitters wants to believe so this is easier than you think.

5) Cheating: e.g. getting people to write down personal info. You then steal it with techniques like center tear, billet switch, impression device and so on and the sitter never realises."

Fast forward 2 hours and we are both balls deep in this trip playing Mario kart on the Wii and the garage door opens. Holy fuck it's my dad and brother in law. They have never met my girlfriend before this and wanted up to help move furniture up from the basement. I found myself staring my dad directly in the eyes as we were haulti g a heavy table up the stairs. My pupils must've been the size of small plates. I don't think he noticed my eyes cause he has relatively bad vision and it was in the dimly lit basement out to the darkness. I had a moment if relief we he said, ""garage smells good"".

13383,"IT shops/ IT consulting

For every good IT company, there's 3 others that will cut EVERY corner.

x10000000 so if the IT company caters mostly to residential, they will cut EVERY corner, cut down the middle, across...really they just put the whole thing in the shredder.

I've seen:

* VPN's without authentication (literally just pop in an IP address and you're in their entire network)

* Intentional sabotage of computers and servers

* Grossly over charging for items. Bonus if they used a free product to fix the issue they overcharge for that states ""not for commercial use""

* We've gotten clients that were told ""Oh but &lt;competitor they left&gt; said Windows XP is fine!"" We then later find out they have spent hundreds of dollars a quarter working on fixing issues with said computer.

* Putting in bids for big government jobs and ""accidentally"" leaving off entire builds so their price was the lowest, won the bid, and later ""requote"" the job they already won.

* Literally swapping out good quality parts in a customers computers/server with inferior equivalents, when the customer just needed a keyboard replacement. Later selling the parts they stole.

* One of our competitors does a clients alarm system, but we do their IT. They went into the server room and rearranged battery-backup devices to cover the vents on the server so it would over-heat....which it did. 

All from sketchy IT companies that are more concerned about being ""the cheapest and fastest"" and not ""The professional, proper,   and security compliant""

**TL;DR** : You know horror stories from sketchy mechanics purposely breaking your car, or doing other sketchy shit? Yeah. IT as a service is just as bad, if not worse, ESPECIALLY if they cater to residential"

13395,"Construction contractor here. There's a HUGE difference between commercial and residential contracting. 

Commercial contracting is much better for contractors and customers.  Theres much less shady business. Busineses, developers, factories, property managers, municipalities usually pay willingly and fairly for high quality work. The scope of work is well planned ahead of time and decisions are made on reasonable, rational basis. They usually buy on quality and service, instead of a cheap price because the clients are well informed. 

Residential contracting is much worse. Shitty contractors and utterly unreasonable, irrational  clients. Customers often don't know quality and buy on price alone, yet complain when they get ripped off, because shitty contractors exploit their cheapness. Lots of customers simply don't pay. "

The main character is clumsy and unpopular but then the zombies came and they grabbed a katana and killed ten zombies in one blow and then the romantic interest that they secretly pined for suddenly realizes how awesome they are and they live happily ever after. 

The real hint to if one of these books will suck is to see if they ever actually describe the character in any detail or if it's left vague so that the reader can insert themselves into the role.  Twilight is a good example.  Bella is just described as an average girl by the author meaning pretty much any teenage girl (or god help me, middle aged woman) can picture herself as Bella.

13494,"Our Sports Teacher is jumping ship to teach at a school that lets him teach what he was trained to teach (Media/English). He put his notice in two weeks before the end of last term, and is set to leave in a couple of weeks. The deal was that he'd train up the new hire; however no training has occurred becayse no hire has materialised. I had a look online, and there's no job adverts for the position. He's been told that he's not allowed to tell anyone that he is leaving, even though he's only got two weeks left. The Principal was rather annoyed that some of us do know that Sports Teacher is going. 

I think the plan is to not hire anyone and try and guilt him to stay on because ""there's no one to take the position"". We're already a teacher down, with a number of teachers teaching subjects they aren't trained in, so we can't fill the position internally. 

Escape, Sports Teacher. Run far. "

&gt;I was day tripping to Vancouver from Seattle and stopped in for lunch at a little cafe. From my window I saw a young teenage girl out in the cold, squatted down in a closed up businesses doorway, holding a small bundle in her arms. She was panhandling, people were mostly walking by ignoring her. She looked just broken.

&gt;I finished up my meal and went outside, went through my wallet and thought I'd give her $5 for some food. I got up to her and she was sobbing, she looked like she was 14-15. And that bundle in her arms was a baby wrapped up. I felt like I just got punched in the chest. She looked up putting on a game face and asked for any change, I asked her if she's like some lunch. Right next door was a small quick-Trip type grocery store, I got a can of formula for the baby (very young, maybe 2-3 months old.), and took her back to the cafe though I'd just eaten. She was very thankful, got a burger and just inhaled it. Got her some pie and ice cream. She opened up and we talked. She was 15, got pregnant, parents were angry and she was fighting with them. She ran away. She's been gone almost 1 full year.

&gt;I asked her if she's like to go home and she got silent. I coaxed her, she said her parents wouldn't want her back. I coaxed further, she admitted she stole 5k in cash from her Dad. Turns out 5k doesn't last long at all and the streets are tough on a 15 year old. Very tough. She did want to go back, but she was afraid no one wanted her back after what she did.

&gt;We talked more, I wanted her to use my phone to call home but she wouldn't. I told her I'd call and see if her folks wanted to talk to her, she hesitated and gave bad excuses but eventually agreed. She dialed the number and I took the phone, her Mom picked up and I said hello. Awkwardly introduced myself and said her daughter would like to speak to her, silence, and I heard crying. Gave the phone to the girl and she was just quiet listening to her Mom cry, and then said hello. And she cried. They talked, she gave the phone back to me, I talked to her Mom some more.

&gt;I drove her down to the bus station and bought her a bus ticket home. Gave her $100 cash for incidentals, and some formula, diapers, wipes, snacks for the road.

&gt;Got to the bus, and she just cried saying thank you over and over. I gave her a kiss on the forehead and a hug, kissed her baby, and she got on the bus.

&gt;I get a chistmas card every year from her. She's 21 now and in college.

&gt;Her name is Makayla and her baby was Joe.

&gt;I've never really told anyone about this. I just feel good knowing I did something good in this world. Maybe it'll make up for the things I've f-ed up."

Another woman who also knew my friend just kind of made her way next to mutual friend. I accidentally made eye contact with this other woman and she seized the opportunity to step forward, thrust out her had and introduce herself. It was so sudden it took me by surprise. And she just kept up the conversation and we ended up hanging out the entire evening just talking and laughing.

One thing I liked most about it was how simple it is.  I went from playing League (which required constant playing to keep up &amp; reading patch notes, etc just to stay at the same level of skill, AND dealing with constant toxicity) to Stardew where I didn't have to look anything up at all just... play.

13534,"Reminds me of **Mao**, which is played with a standard deck of cards. I learned it at camp, and the only things I was told for the rules were:

1. It's played like Uno.

2. Whenever you win, you get to add a rule.

3. These are the only 3 rules you can talk about.

The next 30 minutes involved me getting cards thrown at me for what felt like every thing I did; getting confused at people saying stuff like ""Point of Order,"" ""Have a nice day,"" and ""Talking""; and slowly figuring out what was happening, only to have it all thrown under the bus once someone won and got to add a new rule that only they knew. It was an incredibly fun experience, and I wish I could forget the game and learn how to play it again."

13543,"Sometimes our gut instincts are only *sort of* right.

When I was in seventh grade, there was this girl who was really quiet and sort of creepy. And she *smelled.* (like shit--literally.) She wore these odd dresses that looked like pioneer dresses (homemade). And she was just, well, creepy. No one talked to her. People tried to avoid sitting next to her. We all gossiped about her as being the epitome of creepiness.

Then one day she was gone. Didn't come to class.

The next day, it was all over the news: the police had arrested these horrifically abusive parents, who were neglecting and abusing their daughter, and who had kept their younger son locked in a cage *his entire life.* And never fed him. The younger boy was kept alive by--you guessed it-- his older sister. The police were led to the house by neighbors' complaints about the stench.

So this poor, smelly girl was suffering abuse from her parents, and all the while sneaking food and water to her little brother--who was *literally locked in a cage* for years upon years... keeping him alive-- and then coming to school, where she would be avoided and mocked behind her back and sometimes humiliated.

She was a weirdo, and our ""guts"" all told us there was something wrong there.

But she was a fucking hero.

13545,"I worked for a print company that did have an amazing culture.  5 years ago they bought another failing printer.  When the two companies combined they began to remove our existing management and replace them with the management of the company they had purchased.

""What's the meaning of greed is a selfish desire for something for power, food, and wealth?"" (I told him to define greed. Defining your terms is important and he'd get marked off if he didn't.)

""... one points me and guys had guy's night which we have a great time just being guys. Unfortunately, on that night there was the guy who was our friend but now he's acquaintance because he activates his middle-finger move."" (This one's just hilarious. Every time I try to read this aloud to my friends I burst out laughing and can't finish the sentence!)

""For example, my rich friend went on a date with a Canadian girl. What did my rich friend had a good time with his date; then unlucky event happen he went to the bathroom because of the reason that doesn't involve with ditching. My friend accidentally drops his wallet, and he went to the bathroom. She grabs his wallet and left the restaurant. My friend came back surprise and realized he lost his wallet. In other words, he's broke as hell and washes the dishes instead of sending him to Jail. Ever since that date, he never dates a Canadian person or travels to Canada because in his point that Canadians are thieves."" (Maybe his friend is just stupid...)

""So group tells the guy to pay the full share. The man disagrees then he ran out of Chills and never seen again only until tomorrow."" (Never seen again... But then they saw him the next day.)

""Although, the tactic of avoiding paying the bill. Another way is to enhance their beauty within their appearance. For example, my cosplayer friend [redacted]. A cosplayer is a person who dresses up as the character related to anime, cartoon or video games. She always looks elegant and beautiful outfit of a character she cosplays as. When she wears her normal clothes, she still looks cute and natural. One night we get our boba drinks from a shop called [redacted]. So I and [redacted] ordered our drinks. I looked at her, she looks happy in a pretty way then glance at me. My cheeks started to get red. So I told her that I would pay for our drinks... I asked her why she has to look cute. She replied, ""It's to make guys pay for my stuff and someone who I'd like."" I kinda felt angry that she used me but I was curious about the person who she liked. On the way to [redacted]'s house. I asked her ""So who do you like?"" When we arrived at her house. she turns around and went to me then push her smooth lips to my lips. [redacted]  steps back and replied, ""I love you, baka."" Baka means in Japanese is a fool."" (r/thathappened...)

""For example, people always take advantage of their men related to money. The women's point of view of men are personal money spenders, and some men's point of view towards people is some kind of powerful god or someone in royalty. My thought on this subject are slavery and women being cheap. That be another way to avoid paying is taken advantage of your date and act like your a spoiled royal brat. A woman who would do that which is my mother because she doesn't work but take care of my sister but her husband does all the work. The worst part of my mother that she begs for money from me because I'm her child."" (He doesn't have a job and all his money comes from his parents.)

This was written by a freshman in college. I'll post the entire essay if anyone's interested in reading the full train wreck.

EDIT: [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onDuE-K0fykMxq3ZJozUEBqgHw24NSCVZ1W9YjachwU/edit?usp=sharing) the full essay! I took out the names of his examples, and a few stores that would give away our location. If this isn't allowed let me know and I'll remove it.

To clarify, I believe his first language is Vietnamese, but he told me he grew up speaking English as a kid."

13625,"So this always sounds terribly dumb in hindsight because the reason we originally broke up was because she wanted to see what it’s like dating other people (I.e. my best friend) because I was the first person she had ever dated.

 Sure I was upset, but I never stopped being in love (she was my first love and other best friend) and there was just something magnetic about her, no matter what happened I kinda knew that I was susceptible to her charms, and I think it was the same for her. So we started dating again after we hooked up on my birthday and dated for like 2 years after that.

Jokes on me though, once I left to college, about a year in long distance, she told me she wanted to take a 3 month break and “meet other people” on my birthday. The irony lmao. I had to break it off then, because I didn’t want to be her “just in case it all fails”.  So yea, probably don’t date your exes no matter how strongly you feel about them. There’s a reason you broke up the first time.

Edit: Clarifications."
13626," On the other hand, as a very talkative and extrovert aspergers I'm very fond of people giving me this as a queue to lay down some basic principles in communicating. Coupled with some bonus insight in my own situation, which helps them cope with having to adapt to me, I feel like I can have a safe ground from where on out I can work.
&gt; 
&gt; I basically spent my adolescence analysing in which ways I would like to interact with the people around me, which thought processes resulted in my emotions and the observation that for most people their emotions seem to dictate their thoughts, and the painfully slow reading and reproducing of nonverbal queues. This might be why I feel comfortable talking about my thoughts as an aspie and I feel like I can actually help people to cope with me.
&gt; 
&gt; The main things I ask of people is, as said above, to be specific. But I agree that that might be exhausting for someone who doesn't analyse their own conscious and related unconscious thoughts every second of every day, so the main point for me is reminding people that I DON'T form an opinion of them as a person based on their personal opinions, and that I would very much appreciate it if they try to take my criticism or inquiries as a way to find a connection between us rather than as a personal attack. Since I can't naturally feel the motives behind the sentences, and don't ever feel the need to express myself in such a way, I really like to understand people on a very fundamental level. It makes me appreciate people the way i feel like they want and deserve to be appreciated, it's just very unfortunate that most social interactions are based on a way more chit-chatty 'happy we're communicating', because that just isn't communicating to me!

13630,"Reminds me of a story my dad told me about one of his multi-millionaire friends. My parents had just gone up to visit for a weekend (mom was friends with them since before they were rich). After 3 or so meals that the rich guy paid for my dad insisted he pay the next, but the guy declined and said it was fine. They were eating at this 5* restaurant, super expensive stuff. My dad said multiple times throughout the dinner that he was going to pay, only to be told no it's fine. Near the end of the meal my dad excused himself to go the bathroom, but instead went around the corner and ambushed the waitress with his card in hand.

When the rich dude found out he was really surprised, and sincerely thanked him. "

13656,"I had a kid my freshman writing class who was the same! Tiny kid, seemed sweet at first, always wore a huge, oversized jacket that he seemed to never wash. He would interrupt class with these bizarre non sequitur statements, always talking about rivers of blood, the undead, torture chambers, shit like that. Other kids in the class would stare at me wide-eyed whenever he opened his mouth, and I was quietly preparing to alert the authorities about him and mentally running through the steps of alerting our campus to a school shooter. Then he finally turned in his first memoir essay, which was about watching a beloved close family member die slowly from a chronic illness. Kid was an INCREDIBLE writer – I literally handed his paper back with my own tear stains on it (and I’m a fucking English teacher; I’m using “literally” correctly, heh). 

After that, whenever he would say something bizarre, I would say, “Dude, you’re scarin’ the straights!” or some other teasing statement, and just let it go. He eventually calmed down, and I realized it had all been an act to scare people away from him – he had been bullied, and adopting the persona of a future school shooter was the only way he could keep kids from terrorizing him in high school. He admitted as much – he used to stop by my office and talk to me all the time. He turned into one of the biggest cheerleaders for our school we’ve ever had, offered to come back and speak at orientation for new students, etc. He ended up getting accepted into a very competitive engineering program and is doing extremely well now. Sometimes, maybe even the majority of the time, those kids are just terrified. I guess the hard part is finding a way to get them to admit it."

13660,"I don’t really know where my beliefs stand, but:

When I was 16 my sister spent her last few days in the hospital.
I remember her close friend came to pick me up from school to see my sister. At this time I didn’t know how serious my sister’s condition was, but before we went to the hospital we swung by my house so I could get some things to take.

I felt uneasy and my instinct told me something was wrong so I started to cry.
Of course I knew my eyes would dry out since I wore contact lenses; so I took my eye drops with me.

A few days passed, it happened.
My family stayed at the hospital to take care of everything and another family friend took me home.

In this time, the last person to be at my home was me—that was the day I grabbed my eye drops.

On the way home, despite being the saddest I’d been in my entire life, I remember my eyes becoming painfully dry due to the crying.
Then, I remembered I left my eye drops on her bedside table.
I remember very specifically.

When I got home, the same bottle of eye drops (I only had one bottle) was on my desk in my bedroom.
This was so shocking to me but somehow comforting because it gave me sense of possibility.

I still can’t explain it.

Also, a bird just shit on my arm while I was typing this."
13661,"I thought I was pregnant. I had been on the pill for 5+ years without a pregnancy scare, but I had this weird feeling. Bought a pack of two tests. Took one test, it came out negative so I threw the other test in the medicine cabinet in case. Started my period the very next day but it only lasted 2 or 3 days. Went on a trip with my then boyfriend to meet all of his family and I was an emotional bitch but thought it was just from my car sickness. Made an appointment to have an IUD put in. The night before the appointment I went shopping for food and alcohol for a game night we were having but when I got home I went to smoke a cigarette and it made me puke which was really weird. So I figured what the hell, take the other test and the double lines came up before I even set the test down to wait the 3 minutes. Fuck. Game night cancelled. The IUD appointment turned into an ultrasound, I was already 9 weeks pregnant. "

13663,"Happened to me with PCP. Someone slipped me some with a bong hit, refused to admit anything. I went home and decided to go to bed which turned out to be a horrible idea. Thought I'd just woken up and dreamed the last hour, then the last day, then my whole life. Freaked out, ended up on the floor in the living screaming about wanting to know what was real and what wasn't. Continued to have a Groundhog Day experience for about four more hours before I finally just snapped back to reality. Thank God I managed to text my sister and I thank my sister for helping me out, easily the most frightened I've been in my life, nobody knows how to terrify you better than your own mind."

And then I wouldn't eat there again for another few months.  Rinse and repeat.

13677,"When I was either 7 or 8 I wanted to commit suicide and almost attempted it. Fucks me up now thinking about how young I was when I was about to attempt it. We had just moved to another school (again) and kids were making fun of me because I was weird and the new kid. I couldn't handle the teasing and harassment at school anymore, compounded on the fact me and my mom had both been abused by her ex husband, and after they got a divorce he stalked her, forcing us to move every few months (although I don't remember how much I knew or understood about the stalking) Mental illness also runs in my family so genetically I was fucked on that too.

There was a hole in the fence of the playground at school. I remember thinking about how living was too painful and it would've been better if I hadn't been born. I was staring at it crying, thinking about how I could run out into the street when a car came by so I could get hit by it. Looking back idk if it actually would've killed me. Car could've stopped in time, or I could've just been seriously injured. I was planning it out when a group of kids came over and started talking to me, saying how those kids were jerks and offering to have me play with them. I did and they became my first solid friend group. When I was in 2nd grade I had a friend for a brief amount of time before we moved again. But this was a whole GROUP of friends!! They saved my life/seriously injuring myself that day, I'm still friends with one of them on Facebook but I never told them that they just barely stopped me from attempting to commit suicide."

13686,"Nipples have a whole bunch of tiny ducts leading from the mammary glands (where the milk is made) to the pores in the skin. If a lactating woman squeezes her breast the milk sort of sprays out in a lot of very fine jets. (Seriously, I only know this because I was four and my baby sister was nursing and I asked how the milk came out.)

Some animals, like cows, have teats instead of nipples. A teat just has one duct and one hole to let the milk out. 

I think if a woman didn't have the ducts or pores to express milk it would be like not being able to sweat. The glands are in there but the product has no way to get to the surface. Puncturing wouldn't do anything because the structures that transport the milk are just not there. She'd probably have to stop trying to nurse so that her body stopped trying to produce milk, and bottle-feed. In the meantime her breasts would be pretty painful. "
13687,"Best thing you can do to help with this is cut back on your meat consumption, or at least only buy meat that isn't raised with antibiotics.

13696,When me and my SO first moved in together we rented a pokey little flat from an estate agent. We were totally overcharged and discovered soon after moving in that there was some weird furry mould that kept appearing in our kitchen. When we told him about it he just shrugged and said yeah that happens just wipe it off when it comes back. There was also only one door in and out of the property and the windows in the back were barred and the ones at the front painted shut. Oh and the 'furniture' that came with the property gave us scabies. We were only 18 at the time and totally spineless. Needless to say we were out of there when the rental agreement ended after 6 months and a swift email sent to the environmental people.

All of a sudden the guy pulls out a blow torch of sorts and starts yelling at the cops to leave. After a few tense moments, the guy yells ‘If you don’t leave we’re gonna have roast pig tonight!!!’ And starts brandishing the blow torch. Doors were kicked down soon after. Still kills me to this day. 

He also had to save a snapping turtle once. Except, like the guy above, the snapping turtle didn’t want to be saved. It took him nearly 45 minutes to get this thing out of the road because it kept snapping at him and going after him. The dash cam footage is hilarious. "

Being 8 and naive, I didn't know what that was, but since it was a swear word, it must be bad. He tried to take my clothes off, but he couldn't figure out my jumper. He also tried to stick his fingers up my cooch. He only stopped because he thought he heard someone walking by. As for me, I had no idea what I just avoided, just that my dad would probably be very angry at me if he knew what happened, so I kept it secret for a long time. Really, the home life was bad enough. It was only as an adult that I realized the danger I was in. I recently found out that boy became an elementary school teacher and coach."
13706,"My wife, if she had a sore throat, was given a shot of either whisky or Tia Maria and would take a tiny sip during commercial breaks and swish it around and slowly swallow it. I'm talking one shot over like thirty to sixty mins.

This is a remedy, but later her dad told me he also wanted her to get used to straight whisky so that she would drink that instead of mixed drinks so that when she went to university she'd be less likely to have something slipped in her drink. That's foresight!

And now she orders straight whisky (her favourite drink, Alberta Premium/Springs) and all the guys look at her like ""yeah, right"" then keep watching until she actually takes a sip and they all act amazed."

13717,"Mine is a train story too. Christmas Eve about 10 years ago, two friends and I were riding a train from Beijing to Xian, China. That's a long train ride, and it was packed. The three Americans had already caught the eye of almost everyone on the car, and I was so confused by the seating system, that by the time this little old granny makes her way down the aisle to insist I get out of her seat, I was so flustered I didn't know what to do. Random guy seated next to the three of us starts talking to the granny and gesticulating madly, obviously trying to convince her to just let the three of us sit together and go sit in an empty seat a few rows back, but she wasn't having it. So I get up and start to make my way to this bench that it seems like no one is sitting at. Next thing I know, our Chinese seat mate who was trying to convince Granny to cut me a break is sitting next to me. This was a long train ride--about 10 or 12 hours, all told. All night long, my seatmate kept buying food from vendors walking by and feeding me, I don't even know what most of the stuff was. There were some oily peanuts that were impossible for me to shell, so seatmate would shell them for me and pile them up on a napkin for me to eat. There was a mystery meat stick that didn't kill me. And oranges! Anyway, seatmate's English was about as good as my Chinese (which is to say, non-existent) so we couldn't really converse at all... Except to occasionally gesture to stick-in-the-mud granny and roll our eyes and laugh. So thanks, mystery seatmate, for helping to make an awkward situation far more tolerable for a fish out of water on that Christmas Eve train ride!"

Some night, an American bombing happened, and he was hit by shrapnel, a few inches away from his heart. My great grandfather violated the curfew to find a doctor and he went under surgery on the potatoes stash, and they feed his burnt  flesh to the dog.

Managed to flip himself and the board off of a cot, talk to all the other patients, etc. Woke up unaware that he was naked (we'd covered him up, obviously), with no memories of the night before or where we left his clothes.

Then she moved to Florida. When she did, she was *supposed* to end the AL CS and start a case in FL, she didn't. She went to FL and filed for all her ""single mother who doesn't want to work"" benefits like food stamps and Medicaid, and to avoid having to changeover the CS and not have to renegotiate or give me the opportunity to appeal the amount, she attested I was dead, and in doing so the state granted her and our kids survivorship benefits as well.

She had no idea how much or little I was drinking at the time, other than what my friends' had told her and what I had told her.

She called me up one night and tearfully said I needed to get help or she couldn't be with me. I stopped drinking altogether for a while and saw a therapist for a few months, and that seemed to make her happy.

At the time I didn't think, and still don't think, I was an alcoholic or even close to being one, but being able to speak to a therapist and work out some of my other issues was helpful for us in the long run.

You need to cook your garlic in a fat then incorporate that fat into your food or you simply will not taste it, and you need to use salt and seasonings properly - cook them in, don't add them after. Most seasonings will have their flavors carried by fats so cook them out first or you just won't taste it.

Personally, I keep my seasonings low key and try to use salt, fat, and acid properly. One of the things that causes meat to be flavorless is overcooking. People cook the fuck out of their chicken because they are afraid of it but you just need to reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit for a few moments and it's done. Any more and it's tough and flavorless. Any less and you risk food-borne illness."
13790,"My parents make/made a lot of money. My younger brother is in an industry known for treating its people well money-wise and started making four times as much money as I do, in half the time since graduation, and with worse grades than I received. Between me and my fiancé, we are above the median income for our expensive state. I am currently in the beginning of a solidly middle class career (teaching) and my parents are FREAKING out that I’m going to suffer for the rest of my life for lack of money. (To be fair, I am currently pretty low income since I’ve just changed careers a year ago, so I’m at the bottom of the money totem pole, but even the average income for a teacher is “poverty” to them.)

Every conversation with them includes something about “Well, you can always do something different” or “You’re just going to struggle so much and you don’t even understand it because we always supported you.” I get a lot of half-baked demands that I supplement my income by writing and publishing a book in my spare time or working as a seasonal paralegal in the summer. When I say how much I like my job, I get “Well, maybe you could be superintendent!” It’s all coming from a place of concern, but it’s got the undertone of “what you’re doing isn’t good enough.”

All of them have a really weird concept of what money is worth. My brother is a bit more reasonable since he’s been on his own for a while, but he still has his moments.  For the past couple of Christmases, my parents have been giving me and my brother decent chunks of change to put into CDs and savings to help out later down the road when we buy our own houses. They’re adamant that we not spend it on anything else in the meantime. When I told them what my salary was, they immediately accused me of spending the house money because they didn’t believe it was possible for me to be staying on budget. I had to show my mom the bank account with all the money in it before she believed me. 

And, like, I want to stress that this doesn’t come from a place of snobbery but it’s just the result of almost two decades living a life so far removed from the average. It’s a loss of perspective, with maybe a dash of “I know better than you” thrown in. And I spent most of my life living that way and benefitting from my parents’ luck, hard work and financial savvy, so it’s not like I’m an outsider looking in. It’s just what they’re used to."

Edit: This comment seems to be getting a lot of views,so I'd like to add a few things. Poodles are not easy. Rewarding, yes. Easy, no.  

They don't shed,  so regular brushing, grooming, and clipping are not optional, just from a health point of view. That is either expensive or time consuming, depending on whether you go to a groomer or learn to do it yourself.  

They are very smart, so they're a dream  to train. You MUST carefully train and socialize them, though. They're plenty smart enough to find things to do to keep themselves occupied, and those things are often things you will not be happy about. Imagine having a 2 year old child for 14 years. They can be super sweet, but you have to set and enforce boundaries forever.  

Poodles are super social - but that means they're a POOR choice if you can't give them a lot of attention. If nobody is home 10-12 hours a day, please don't get a poodle. They want to be with you and around you and where they can see you as much  as they can.  Yes, my dog does fine when I go to work at the office. My husband's and my schedules overlap such that she's only home alone about 6 hours, we have a big yard, and a dog door.

They're water dogs. You gotta make sure they can swim and are comfortable, because they'll jump in w/out thinking. They'll be in every puddle and stream and drip water everywhere. I had a poodle who wanted to play in the toilet (all 4 feet, whee) when she was  a pup. You gotta manage that.

They're the perfect breed for me, but I'll also tell you that they can be holy terrors in the hands of folks who don't meet the admittedly high demands of the breed."

13840,"Specifically in France, Incubators for premature infants were first used as a side show attraction for circuses as hospitals didn't use them, as they saw the machines as too much effort and marked premature infants as certain deaths. Circus shows used them to show off the tiny alien-like humans and grow large crowds, but didn't like how much effort it took to keep the babies alive. So one circus show perfected the care of it with a nurse and better equipment, and he saved hundreds of babies over the years while making bank on the ""freak show"".  Once doctors saw that, oh shit these babies can actually live, they adopted the same practices and started working to save premies.  But before that time, if you had a premature baby in France the doctor may literally recommended taking your baby to the circus to be saved. "

I left my old job but gave shit tons of notice because I liked the place and cared about it and its mission. I helped in the interview process to find my replacement. I spent weeks training her and when I left I even offered her my personal email and number to call me if she had questions or issues.

This bitch did nothing for like two months and what she did do was awful. I know this because though I didn't want that particular job, I stayed attached to the agency as a temp assistant for my boss. I looked over materials she wrote and holy shit, she would just copy and paste from materials we had given as sources for her to consider, but she would not even try to shape it in anyway. This was shocking as part of the interview process was a writing sample, which she did great at.

It came to a head with one particular project, which was just a marketing letter that needed to be prepared for Monday. She sent it to my boss (now her boss) on Friday night and asked her to finish it for her as she needed it Monday and she couldn't do it over the weekend. Note that by boss will help damn near anyone if need be, but she already works like 60 hours a week and has like a multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars project of her own with an immediate upcoming deadline. My boss was shocked and looked it over... complete wreck. The woman had a month to write this letter and had met with my boss like 3 times for ideas and edits.

That deadline ended up being pushed so it worked out... but then there was a different deadline for the next week. My replacement had to write a grant in a fairly short time frame (like 2 weeks: that sucks, but it happens sometime). It was for a relatively small amount. Again she met my boss many times to discuss strategy and edits and it is due on Friday. This bitch sends it to my boss Thursday night to ""edit and fix because I am not sure this is what you wanted."" I enter back in here again because my boss calls me and offers to pay me to come in next day to do emergency surgery on the poor collection of words this woman has stitched together as it was due in less than 24 hours. I did it. It took 10 hours. It wasn't great or maybe even good, but it was acceptable as opposed to something that would have made us look like a laughingstock.

At this point my boss is done with this woman decides she has to go. It is clear she is going to fail and leave, and the only question is when. The longer that takes, the more behind we will be when it finally does happen. The woman agrees she should go when my boss brings it up. Turns out she has another job interview lined up already. She was just planning on setting the agency (a small nonprofit that helps victims...) on fire to keep herself warm until she could move on to something else... and again, this was after we spent weeks training her and only about two months from the time she started. Appreciate that, it is not like funding is hard enough to find as it is.

Long story short, I am now back full time in the job I was trying to leave and spent this week working on picking up the pieces of what should have been finished months ago while keeping current for what is coming up next. Tomorrow I am going to work on that letter with the pushed deadline, the one my ""replacement"" failed at weeks ago. No big deal right, its only that this pushed deadline also caused a delay in the project that will end up causing me hours of tedious busywork in addition to that because she missed a meeting with volunteers who were going to help us with this project en mass on a certain weeks past date.

When she left she told my boss that she felt like ""she had a weight off her shoulders."" She then spent 20 minutes showing me ""what needed done"" before she had to leave for her new interview. She was so nice and pleasant though and told me I could call her later that day or the next if I had questions. God, she seemed so smug about it. I offered this to her literally out of the kindness of my heart and I answered her questions literally as volunteered time to try to help her and the agency succeed. Turns out she got pre-approved for up to two additional hours of pay if I decided to take her up on the offer: I didn't because it was clear she had nothing of use to offer.

But let's be real here, that's not what you meant. You are one of those guys who associates stupid arbitrary shit like raw steaks with 'masculinity', otherwise why call the alternative 'pussies' and why be so invested in how others have their steaks?

Imagine listening to some douchebag call anybody who doesn't drink their coffee black a 'pussy'.

Not only does it sound ridiculous, you would assume this person for some stupid reason associates how one takes their coffee with their masculinity, machismo, strength, etc.

Start with one thing, make it your new thing, you do that thing until become second nature, to the point that you don't even consider it much of a thing, but rather just something you do. Then, do it again with something else. You'll find that now you'll have an easier time doing both. Think of it like you only have so much will power, you can't take on a bunch of new things that require a lot of will power each. And you can't really increase your total pool of will power. But what you can do is do something new for so long that you've compressed how much will power it takes to do, allowing you to now take on another new thing."

All of my aunts and uncles seem to remember their dad being to hard on them, mean, and pushing them to work harder on the farm than what a kid should be worked. I was riding with my grandpa in his truck when he started talking about his childhood and it was all the same shit his kids say about him and how hard his dad always was on him and his siblings. 

I thought this stone wall of a man was going to start crying as he said ""If I could change anything in my life I wish I could have raised them all differently."" 

Your kids are gonna fuck up and be little shits. When it comes to punishment on their actions just remember that you are probably more mature than they are.

13943,"I dont remember all of the details, but during a psych rotation in nursing school we got to go to a meeting where they talked about cases they needed help diagnosing. They were talking about a kid (12ish years old) who acted like a zombie or a wild animal. All of the sudden he would snap and bite people in the room, and growl and run around on all fours. I guess he bit his cousin and his cousin started acting like this too (same ish age).

 I think he told the therapists that he had some big secret that was eating at him or causing stress at school (of course the joke passed around was ""his secret is that he got bit by a zombie or a werewolf""). The therapists believe its something to do with sexuality, like his discovery of being gay (and possibly experimenting with the same sex cousin). In any case, this kid was out of control, biting and scratching people. 

Eventually the team sort of decided on a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conversion disorder isnt super well understood, but they believe it is brought on by extreme stress in many cases. It can cause people to have pseudo-seizures, numbness, paralysis, weakness, etc. But having symptoms like this kid had is very weird and rare for this disorder. They think the cousin started doing the same thing for attention. "

13957,"So since there are no actual EMS providers chiming in I guess I will. I volunteered with a rescue squad that was tasked with providing EMS for the Blue Ridge Music Festival. It was a very small scale country music festival that went on for 2 days. It was far from a huge festival, but there were hundreds of people present and it was a bit of a logistical nightmare. So the first year they did this festival we were woefully under prepared. We had maybe 40 or so providers and it was all hands on deck, but we were split up roughly 20 on one day and 20 on the other. The temperature outside was in the 80s or 90s and they were serving tall 24 oz beers to people as the only alcohol you could get. You overpaid and got these tall boys and then went and crushed it out in the heat where there was no shade as it was a smaller highschool sized football stadium with no real covering. They had the bright idea to cover the field with this big black tarp and everyone was out lying on this thing all day. What resulted was a fucking redneck bloodbath. 

First of all, these were people that are not used to the festival atmosphere, local bros, country girls with their cowboy boots on their feet all day, not drinking enough water, getting shit housed on these tall boys. It was a recipe for disaster. A lot of people didn't realize that you cant dome 6 24oz beers like you can dome a standard 12 oz six pack. But theres still beer in your can so you keep drinking and only count that as 1 beer because math. 

It wasnt long before the radios were blowing up. We had drunk people falling out all over the stadium. We had people stationed all over the place trying to respond to calls and while on their way they would stumble upon someone else that was covered in vomit and not able to sit up. Then we had teams dedicated to the parking lot because people were pregaming out there. Its next to impossible to respond to a 911 call for 'a drunk guy passed out next to the back of a pickup truck' when that is the scene every 5 feet. I would head to a call for someone down/seizing/injured with 3 or 4 people and have to send the other providers off in different directions to follow people asking for help with other sick/injured/seizing people. I vividly remember stepping out from our little tent and seeing the mass of drunks we had collected. All these people piss drunk lying around drinking the water we gave them. I watched as a girl walked up, started vomiting, and just walked along this whole row of people spraying them. It was a warzone. 

We got our asses handed to us for two days straight and thankfully nobody was seriously injured or died, but we probably sent 15 to 20 people to the hospital over the course of the festivals 2 days and treated/released 3 times that many. Again it was a smaller festival but still for us this was waaaay more than we were equipped to handle. We were stretched thin but somehow got through it.

So the next year we knew this clusterfuck was coming and we planned accordingly. We brought in 3 other rescue squads to help staff it. We setup rapid exit points at 2 points of the stadium. Basically if a call went out the decision was made that a medic would assess the patient, if they were deemed too sick/fucked up/whatever to remain at the festival and take care of themselves they had two options, PD would escort them off the property or they had to go to the hospital (obviously if someone was not competent to refuse transport they also went to the hospital). Instead of sitting on these fools, anyone too drunk got those two choices and were dealt with quickly. We would have ambulances stationed at either end and as 1 took a patient another would take its place. It might seem like overkill, but yet again we were pushed to the limits even with twice the manpower and a much better plan. This time though things went 1000 times better. We borrowed a FEMA morgue tent and used morgue stretchers to setup a rehab area. Basically if you were just feeling a little sick/needed to get out of the sun you could come into this giant freezer designed to store bodies after natural disasters and lie down on a corpse cot. It worked perfectly. We would rehab people, if after 10 minutes they were still sick, it was once again, either leave or go to the hospital. While that sounds harsh its not like we were booting people for just being drunk, I'm talking people falling down drunk or having obvious medical emergencies. 

It was a good example of learning from your mistakes and developing a revised action plan to handle a large group of people, behaving like idiots, out in the sun all day, not taking care of themselves. Again nobody died and we didn't have a huge number of hospital transports. But one girl around 9 pm was drunk as fuck and fell in the middle of the crowd and broke her fucking ankle, bone obviously protruding. She didn't want to leave because whoever headliner country music star was coming on. We had to strap her to a board while she was still standing trying to see the headliner and carry her out of the place by like 8 people. 

3/10, wont ever work large crowd events ever again if I can help it. "

I told her not to get involved and simply be as supportive to her daughter as she possibly could be. She might ditch the guy eventually but nothing can replace the unconditional love and support of her mom.

I honestly shared your thoughts on some of these people, because every day for them seems to be a cycle of misunderstanding, ensuing rage and meltdowns. The parents get tired and hopeless, as they just want their kids to experience full lives, feel love and become independent. But that may never happen.

He apparently thought we were stopping when his father slowed to let some people cross and panicked when he sped back up. Little man is only 5, but he understands how dangerous cars are and how important being buckled up is. I was almost killed 10 years ago in a head on collision with a drunk driver and I've shown him pictures of what was left of my car. Looking at those pictures, he looked at me in awe and said ""Momma, you could have died like Hobo in there."" (Hobo was our lemon beagle that had passed 6 months prior, it was my son's first experience with death). I told him that if I had not been wearing my seatbelt, I would have.

So, instead of staying quiet and going on my way, on an impulse I yelled across the street ""nice singing!"". One of the guys replied with ""thanks, I'm auditioning for The Voice"".

When our team lead asked us what kind of snacks we wanted, one person asked if it had to be a snack or could it be a big meal? This got us thinking...

Of course $200 isn't going to be enough for 10 people and technically, you are supposed to spend it all in that month, no carry overs. So from the start of the year, our manager has been buying gift cards to a local steakhouse and now we have over $1000 saved up (we still bought some small snacks so it wasn't suspicious) and we're now planning our our big dinner.

14067,"As someone who has actually done opiates, that's not at all what it's like. They make a warm, numb, bubbly, fuzzy sensation everywhere. Some are stronger than others. If you do them a lot for a long time eventually you start needing more to get the same effect. Diminishing returns. A lot of people start out with pills, then move to smoking or snorting H because they think that's 'not as bad'. Then injecting.



If you keep going eventually you body starts starts to need it to function, then it's downhill fast. Addiction starts out small, first it feels like nothing, then like a tiny compulsion, urge, or a tick, you'll probably think it's your choice, that you can stop at any time and go back, when in reality it's the drug controlling you. Then it grows subtly into an intense and deadly illness, a black pit that takes everything, including your self control and hope.



You don't get addicted the first time you do it. Or the second. Or third. If you don't ever go back to it you won't get addicted at all, but you're rolling the dice. It's much more insideous than that. Don't do opiates. There's nothing to be found in the needle. Once you start doing them, then you're around people who do them, then you're around people who are addicted. Then you're stuck. That's the danger.



 People get addicted to hard drugs because they're sad, poor, lonely, bored, with nothing to do, nowhere to go, nobody to love, not even themselves. It's a form of self negation, and that negation itself feels good. If you want to feel good develop a skill, find a hobby, start exercising, volunteer with a charity, read a book, or visit a forest. Do something that will actually make your life better, rather than worse.

14077,"Undertale. Say what you will about the fandom and social context of it, but it’s a really important game for the medium.

Video games are right at the period where their artistic value is starting to be leveraged by creators, but most games still don’t leverage this. An analogy is that film is a really great artistic medium, but not every action flick is artistically valuable. As such, games aren’t typically thought as an artistic medium to society at large.

If I had to choose one game to make the argument that games offer unique opportunities as a medium, it would be Undertale. It’s charming, funny, emotionally powerful, and fun. It has great retro-inspired graphics, a beautiful motif-heavy soundtrack and tons of intertextual references to games.

But more than anything it exemplifies the value of choice and morality in games. This system is something you couldn’t create in a noninteractive medium. At the end of the day, choices where “right” is ambiguous don’t offer a lot in terms of messages on morality. Games where you simply choose “do good” or “do evil” on a dialogue menu reduce the concept to a binary. You don’t want people to choose to be good for mechanical rewards, but you also don’t want to discourage taking benevolent actions.

In Undertale, doing the right thing requires work. It’s hard. But the game pushes you to do it by pulling at both your curiosity and your heartstrings. You push through the challenge because it’s more fun and it makes you feel good.

Undertale, at its core, is about the redemption of character. Every villain is trying their best to do right by the world. In doing the right thing for the world, you redeem not just your character, but yourself as someone who plays games. In eevery conceivable way, the game reaches beyond the screen towards the person playing it.

I recommend everyone give the game a try (preferably blind, but either way- there are some great playthroughs online)."

Should I only come to work with a hat or expect these comments? Or should I teach these kids its not always polite to comment on things they notice, especially when its about someones body. It could also be difficult to find pants that don’t accentuate her body with a physique like hers. Maybe she doesnt wanna wear a loose draping dress everyday just because she doesnt want comments about her body.

"
14115,"Variant: the inverse of this trope. A story is set in a nebulous ""medieval-times"" and the writers lean on sexism, racism, etc. as cheap window dressing (just to show how 'gritty' or 'realistic' things are) while insisting to the audience that it's just ""historical realism"".

Buuuuut every character (including/especially people in life or death situations, who are currently on the run, or are in medieval jail cells) has perfectly plucked eyebrows, shaved body hair, a full face of 21st-century-styled makeup, false eyelashes that take me *completely* out of the story, and other such anachronistic features because that particular window dressing will appease the audience. And of course, no one is dying of smallpox or the plague, and none of the classic issues of medieval life ever come up for anyone.

Bonus points if this is a high-fantasy setting that has no connection to the real world, but the writers were too lazy to invent new social paradigms or cultural norms for their completely original universe. Extra bonus points if the social and cultural norms stay exactly the same, but everything's cut and pasted from the 21st century as-is onto new, fantasy-minorities like dwarves or orcs or elves, and ""humans"" have always been completely homogenous."

14120,"Yeah but there is still a huge difference in foods. Spinach, broccoli, kale, cucumbers etc on one end (very low calorie, high in fibre and vitamins etc) and deep fried Oreos on the other. to imply that all foods are fine in balance is nonsense. Some foods are much much better than others.

Edit: To clarify, I'm not saying eating a particular food will make you fat or eating a particular food will make you healthy. It is all about calories and you can gain weight on ""healthy foods"" and can lose weight on twinkies. However, most people will struggle to do it that way and it is much easier to lose weight when your diet is higher in low calorie and high satiation foods and lower in high calorie/sugar foods. The twinkie diet to lose weight, for example, is not sustainable for 99% of people (and even the guy who did it probably couldn't keep it going forever). 

Going back to the original post I was replying to, he claimed 1) few foods are healthy when eaten excessively and 2) when avoided completely.  (2) is definitely wrong - you can avoid many food completely and still be completely healthy and happy - many people do not have some or all types of junk food in their diet. It is all about balance, for sure, but for a majority of people that ""balance"" is going to be mostly 'healthy' foods and quite sparse on junk food."

14208,My fiancé is a first grade teacher. By far the most common impact the students have on her is the list of names we can no longer name our future kids
14209,"By choice. There are a lot of reasons why. 

1) There is a lot of mental illness and disease in my family that would be transferred genetically.

2) I don't think the world as it is is a good place to live, I wouldn't want to bring a child into it.

3) I can barely afford to house and feed myself comfortably on my salary, a child would suffer needlessly.

4) I have anxiety problems and any time I hear a baby cry it sets my teeth on edge and I literally cannot think straight.

5) I was raised in an abusive household and I do not trust myself enough not to break the cycle. I know 100% I would end up getting frustrated and losing control. Not fair to a kid to risk that just because I want a mini-me.

6) The idea of pregnancy and childbirth is abhorrent to me.

But, moreso than any of that, I just never ever had the desire to be a mother. I don't like babies or kids, I don't enjoy being around them or spending time with them. I like peace and quiet and cleanliness. I work very, very hard for my money and I don't want to spend it on diapers and formula. I know for many many people it's a rewarding experience, but I'm just not wired that way.

I believe having kids should be opt-in, not opt-out. I don't think it should be a default, but rather something you choose to do because you have that spark of lifegiving in you that makes you truly want to be a parent.

Just to clarify, I don't have anything against people who want to be parents; I absolutely respect their right to choose how they want to live. I only expect the same respect for my rights as well.

Two of my friends, Claire and Max, had just left a party being thrown in an off-campus apartment and were walking back to their respective dorms. Max had an almost empty, open beer can with him, and Claire had taken a full family sized bag of Lays potato chips with her on her way out, because why not? Well, our college is located in a relatively affluent suburb, and there's always a large police presence, especially around the off-campus housing. A cop pulled up real slowly next to them, rolls down her window and says sternly ""dump it out."" In a moment of drunk, underaged panic, Claire dumped the ENTIRE family sized bag of Lays out onto the sidewalk. The cop, who is now trying her best to stifle laughter, says ""the beer, dumbass,"" and Max pours out the little that's left and throws it in a nearby trashcan.

My ride was about to leave, so I wrapped up the conversation and they handed me back my ID and the bags, and I walked out of the store without paying. A little while later, I realized that I didn't remember paying, but had no way to check for sure at the moment because smart phones didn't exist yet for a couple more years, and I didn't have access to the internet for another week to check my bank account (was working on a remote job site)."

When i turned 16 they were supposed to automatically give me a raise, in the corporate policy at the time. That didn't happen. When i approached management about it about 2 weeks later they apologized and said they would work on putting the paper work in immediately. Never happened, because new management came in. So i once again asked the new management for a raise, as i was previously promised a raise two times. They said they would work on it. Once again never happened. 

Saw BK was having open interviews on my way home, sat down, interviewed, got the job and told them i could start in 2 days. I was still scheduled to work the next day at McDonald's. Came in, did my job and just started telling all my coworkers I'm done and not coming back. Management easily heard, sat me down. Offered to give me a $1.50 an hour raise. I told them my new job was still going to be paying me $1 an hour over that, then got changed out of my clothes and left.

I felt so alone and as if it was ok for him to do that yet when I wanted to to press charges I was the one in the wrong.

14357,"Worked at the winchester mystery house in San Jose for a while; because I wasn’t driving yet I took the bus regularly to work. This bus usually dropped me off excessively early, like 7AM for my 8AM shift. Sometimes I would meet up with the keyholders for the house and help open it- turning on lights and opening doors and such. 

One of these occasions I ran into a man in white overalls in one of the rooms. I say good morning and go about my way. He nods and says good morning with a really thick accent- German, I think. No biggie, sometimes there are workers who show up early to retouch some part or another of the house. I hadn’t seen this guy around but he might be newer. I mention it to the keyholder when I see him in one of the offices; he takes me to one of the workman’s sheds and points to a picture on the wall. Lo and behold, there’s the workman with about 7 other people. The photo was dated to 1908.  The tour guides named him Clyde. 

Stuff like that wasn’t a daily occurance but happened regularly enough, particularly in the early mornings. I got used to being respectful of the house &amp; whatever inhabitants lived there; enough so that when I put in my two weeks’ notice I got a “gift” from Mrs. Winchester- she played the piano for me.

It really frustrates me, but I've decided to let it go, because he's only human and it's really not the end of the world. He's a really wonderful man, a kind husband and loving father. It's far quicker and easier for both of us if I shut the cupboard doors myself and I'd rather have a happy, pleasant atmosphere then fall out over a door. 

That's just an example, but there are lots of times that I do this. I know that it's reciprocated and he ignores annoying things that I do, many times a day as well. 

Pick your battles. "

14387,"My brother isn't on reddit and he said that when people call someone Autistic in a video game for being stupid or making a mistake, it's wrong because all the Autistic people he knows, as well as himself, are very good at video games. He says they have social handicaps not mental ones.

Growing up with my brother was interesting to say the least. He's older by 2 years but it never felt that way. My brother was a low functioning autist when he was younger but was a savant with computers. When he noticed that other people existed and had complete and complex lives when he didn't see them, he (in his words) traded his savant for social skills. He is now extremely high functioning in that people don't believe him when he tells them he has autism.

People with Autism can grow and change just like everyone else. I think that thinking otherwise is a detriment to autists and society. "

Her favorite is a glass a quarter filled with Fresca, some sparkling water from the kegerator, and a quarter tsp of electrolyte salts.   Kills the headaches.

Once I was assistant manager at a one-hour photo lab. We were next to a strip mall with a sandwich place in it.

One day the store manager decided she didn't like him doing that and made me go to the restaurant and tell him to move his truck. (While he was eating lunch!) I said no and she said I'd be fired if I didn't. So, I went over there and told him the store manager said he needed to move his truck. I told him I was really sorry and I felt horrible. 

He said he wanted to talk to her... I really couldn't wait to see him yell at her. We walked into the lab and I went back and told her he wanted to have a word. 

She told him she never had a problem with it and I was the one that was pissed and that I was trying to blame it on her. Guy called me an asshole and walked out."

14404,"Ive got two.
I was 16 he was had just turned 21. Everything started great but he kept obsessively asked about my exes.  He always wanted to keep tabs on me so I had to call him at regular intervals so he could interrogate me about my day. When I woke up, when I got to school, on my lunch break, when I got home etc, then when I was home for the evening would have to stay on the phone till I went to sleep and spent most of my time crying and begging for forgiveness. Mind you for things that never happened or only happened in his imagination of what I might do. It was so bad the office administrators had the counselors talk to me but this was my first big relationship so I told everyone that things were fine. I lost all my friends. I lost the respect of my family. I lost all respect for myself. I had a job a McDonald's at the time and he would regularly stop by to make sure I was there, even though it was a town over, and of course had to call every break. This was 2003 so I was a couple years from my first cell phone. His obsessive behaviour got so bad he was fired from his job and ""of course"" it was my fault so instead of finding a new job he ""let"" me pay my car insurance and payment then would take the rest of my paycheck to pay his bills. The final straw was when after to running into and hugging a whole family that I knew through chorus he tossed me out of his truck while it was moving , after ripping the promise ring he made me pay for off my finger, for hugging the younger son. To this day he is still won't acknowledge how awful he was and friend requests me constantly. 

The second was a fantastic liar. He was a brewer and always had his 9 year old son in the brewery until 9 or 10 at night. I told him I could babysit at his house and make dinner etc and leave when he got home. I had just got out of a great relationship so was at a low point. I think he sensed my weakness. For the following 3 weeks it's like someone gave that fucked a manuscript of all the right things to say and do, even saw dancing in the living room after his kid went to bed. He started staying at work later and later so if just go to bed cause otherwise it was just a fight.  He was mad the water bill went up by 40 bucks but didn't fare I started paying half the bills. He degraded me and my past, or challenged my intelligence every chance he had. Like who the fuck thinks ascending is z to a. But I was the dumb one. Well one case of mono later my bc failed and I was pregnant.  He immediately told me that my plans for an education were gone and that I would need to be home to raise his son, although I was only 3 months and had no clue of the sex. Well things got worse the fighting got worse, he was gone till almost dawn so I had some responsibility to get his son up, fed and to school, while dealing with morning sickness. I left shortly after for two reasons. The first I caught him coming home to switch his pos truck out for my car to take his female coworker out drinking even though he was smashed, found out this was apparently a common occurrence and he was telling people it was his car. Second after this happened and he left to go hang out one night , in his own truck because from then on I was keeping my keys in my hand while I slept, he came home and drug me out of bed by my ankles into the living room screaming at me about how much of a white I was and I was ruining his life and that I had to have cheated etc.
The next day I packed and left. I told him he could still be in my kids life if he put in the effort  but I wasn't going to do it for him and I could care less about money. 
Fast forward two months to the gender reveal. He came on his own and I had a good friend with me. The whole time all he spoke about was his son,his son etc,etc. 
It was a girl. I was in tears with joy and looked from the monitor to his face.
It looked like he just watched some one kill his puppy or something. He barely spoke the rest of the appointment.  
I haven't seen him fave to face since that day. He called after I gave birth and said we need to talk about the kid, I told him I got it and I didn't need help and that I won't force him to be a parent and he wasn't on the birth certificate at this point. His response...""wow"". Then silence.
I have seen kids try harder to get back to toys they don't even like. It's been over 4 years and we are so much better without him.

Many Americans seem to believe that their states are analogues to EU countries. That's bollocks. Countries like Italy, Spain,  Germany, or France, are each internally almost as diverse or as diverse as the US. People in Marseille or Toulouse or Paris or Lille or Rennes or Ajaccio speak with different accents, live in different houses, eat different foods, behave in different ways, and there are even some who speak different languages or even fight for indepencence. And these regional differences are of course on top of immigration, which also exists in Europe. Meanwhile countries like China or Russia or India are still a LOT more diverse.

We merely adopted the water by learning to swim - sharks live in it.


Do you carry a diver's knife with you? I'm assuming it's mainly used to free yourself from ropes/seaweed or any other debris that might restrain you, but it is also a valid self-defense tool as well. Kind of hard to use it when you're floating and have no leverage though."

14516,"My paw-paw served as an infantryman in the European theater. His unit was part of Pattons ""ghost army."" A few months after D-Day invasion of Normandy, he was in Germany when the Germans launched their last major offensive, in what we know as the Battle of the Bulge.  His platoon was overrun during night hours and slaughtered. He was sole survivor and laid in the snow and freezing temps for over a day afraid to move and be seen by the enemy. The Germans were moving rapidly and when they had advanced away from him, he found himself separated from American troops and behind enemy lines. Although wounded, he survived by hiding and moving under cover of darkness for TWO WEEKS. He finally waded through a near frozen river at night to pick his way around and through German troops. He was able to get back to American troops and report in. He had already been listed as ""killed in action"". During this time, he developed rheumatic fever and its effects plagued him the remainder of his life. 

He ""re-upped"" when the Korean conflict started and volunteered to fight for his country again. 

We lost him last year and sadly I didn’t even know about this until he died. He never talked about ww2 and because we knew it was painful for him we didn’t ask. "

My tip, if you go to a fast food restaurant and all the employees seem to have a very low morale, it's probably best to go somewhere else. I had a great manager, we had a good, fun crew, and I honestly had a lot of fun at that job. Everyone also seemed to care, our give-a-shit levels were quite high. Even when we had a bus load of kids come in after a high school football game or we got slammed and we all had to bust our ass things never turned sour and I think that has a lot to do with it. I can see how in a place where morale is a lot lower the employees might be more susceptible to do things like that, and there can always be a bad apple in a healthy orchard, but the signs are usually there."

This is in case I lock myself out of my car with the keys inside. It actually hasn't happened to me yet, but one day I was like 18 and was left alone for a week with my dachshund. He seemed to be getting bored of me walking him around the neighborhood so I decided to drive him to the local college campus for a walk so he could meet some new people (he loves new people) and pee on new bushes (also loves new bushes). 

Well the town itself isn't super dog friendly so despite him being rather small I can't take him inside anywhere and there isn't any resrtaunts with outdoor seating available. I wasn't in the mood for like some icky drive thru, but it was a hot summer day so I couldn't leave the dog in the car even for a few minutes. Well I blasted the AC and left him some water in a bowl and locked the door from the inside so he could stay cool and I didn't have to worry about the car getting stolen. (I got it to go so I wouldn't be long but I get paranoid about leaving my car unlocked even for 10 minutes).

I spent a weekend coding a script that would pull the relevant daily stuff from these nearly-impossible-to-navigate sites into a single digest.

She took something out, grasping it normally. Except she was holding literally nothing. Her hand was in a position that looked like she was holding some sort of container, but there was nothing there. She said ""I have to take my medicine. Is that ok?"" I wasn't a really judgemental kid and even though I was confused, I was just like ""uh ok."" She proceeded then to pour her invisible pills into her other hand. Unfortunately the container seemed to be lubed up or something because she dropped it. She gasped as she stared at all her pills on the floor. At this point I'm super weirded out but no one seems to have noticed. She starts picking up each pill and placing it into her container. I decided to be polite and randomly grab at the ground and place some of her pills into the container. Maybe to her I was being weird and grabbing nothing. Who knows?   She put a few pills in her hand and placed them into her mouth and ""swallowed"" them. We didnt talk the rest of the way.

I just turned 50 and my symptoms have lessened since I've gotten older.  After Christmas or Summer break in High School is when I noticed it the most as my classmates would return with different clothes and often haircuts / styles.

It does affect me WRT actors and print media also and has not lessened as much as individuals I see in person."

14667,"The following is from some dude's diary or something, from 1905:  


&gt;Here, then, is what I was able to note immediately after the decapitation: the eyelids and lips of the guillotined man worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about five or six seconds. This phenomenon has been remarked by all those finding themselves in the same conditions as myself for observing what happens after the severing of the neck ...  
&gt;  
&gt;I waited for several seconds. The spasmodic movements ceased. \[...\] It was then that I called in a strong, sharp voice: ""Languille!"" I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions – I insist advisedly on this peculiarity – but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in everyday life, with people awakened or torn from their thoughts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next Languille's eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focused themselves. I was not, then, dealing with the sort of vague dull look without any expression, that can be observed any day in dying people to whom one speaks: I was dealing with undeniably living eyes which were looking at me. After several seconds, the eyelids closed again \[...\].  
&gt;  
&gt;It was at that point that I called out again and, once more, without any spasm, slowly, the eyelids lifted and undeniably living eyes fixed themselves on mine with perhaps even more penetration than the first time. Then there was a further closing of the eyelids, but now less complete. I attempted the effect of a third call; there was no further movement – and the eyes took on the glazed look which they have in the dead.

14669,"Black people are treated differently by police/employers/the system than non-black people. 

We systematically enslaved an entire race of people for two centuries and are only a few generations removed from that and it’s no surprise that they are not as well off financially or socially. This oppression was as bad as any genocide. 

The ripple effects of this oppression still are greatly affecting them today. Most people do not care. 

Concentrated poverty has been breeding a drug culture in inner cities for decades. Poverty is concentrated because of NIMBYs don’t want to distribute that poverty(which is shown time and time again to be the most effective way of poverty alleviation) into their area of town. This viewpoint does cause racial tension.

I'm usually paranoid already, and kept flinching cause lol home alone and tiny sounds felt like someone was there.  The usual amount of anxiety you would have if you're already afraid of the night.  Kept telling myself nothing is there, I'm just being irrational, despite the constant feeling of someone staring into the back of my head.

But when I woke up in the morning, I had a bruise in the exact shape of a large hand on my thigh.  There was so possible way it could have been self inflicted. It was a right side up right handed bruise twice the size of my own hand on my right thigh.  My hand would have had to have been broken and flattened to position it where the bruise was.

My parents are convinced I probably fell the day before but nah man, I'm a ginger, I bruise within minutes guaranteed or your money back.  

From that point on I don't fuck with the paranormal, and now I cleanse my room and renew the seals on all four of my walls every month.  By far the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me.  "

A great fat, squat, brown-and-white speckled bird with a scarred beak and the front of its right foot folded under like a victim of Chinese foot binding.  This pigeon has clearly seen (and survived) some shit. When this pigeon is strolling along the pier and someone tosses out a slice of pizza, all the birds, from the smallest sparrow to the largest seagull, stand out of this pigeon's way and allow it first peck.

14700,"I am not sure what OP's definition of rock bottom means, but my story was my rock bottom.  


This happened from 2011 - 2014.  I was in college studying Pre-med readying for MCATS and applying to medical school.    


Fall Semester 2011- I loaded up with 21 credit hours - Organic Chem, Physics, Microbiology,Microbiology Lab, Anatomy, Anatomy TA.  In Fall of 2011 I was misdiagnosed with IBS, I actually had Crohn's Disease.  My physician gave me Nortriptyline (anti-depressant) 25mg because it has shown to help with bowel movements - it didn't help so she upped it to 50mg it didn't help either.  I was constantly in pain, so much pain, like my intestines was twisted up like a towel, while a thousand knives and needles were poking it. Due to my Crohn's I have to use the bathroom frequently during class and in my dorm about 15 times/ day - which disrupted my studying and learning, but somehow I managed a 3.4 GPA   I was 158lbs Fall 2011  


Spring 2012 I took 18 credit hours - Organic Chem, physics, Anatomy, Anatomy ta.  I am 130 lb by now and I blamed it on stress.  My pain still hurts, more than ever.  I was frequenting the bathroom a lot - 28-35 times/day.  I would eat less because eating makings my GI tract hurt.  If you don't know your GI heavily regulates your serotonin - because I wasn't eating and my Crohn's I started suffering from Depression - I was still on Nortriptyline - 75mg because my physician said so.  My Cohn's was so bad my body was not absorbing any nutrients and I also wasn't taking any - hemoglobin was around 6-8, normal is 13.5 - 17.  I started fainting in class and I might sometimes poop myself.  It was really tough on me mentally, emotionally, and socially.  I always had to bring an extra set of clothes to class. I graduated with a 3.5GPA Spring 2012.  


Summer 2012, I saw a GI doctor - I was finally diagnosed with Crohns.  I was 113lbs.  I was fainting in her office from low hemoglobin, fainting from my intense pain, shivering because I have no body fat and low hemoglobin - I was wearing 3 layers when I went to her office. She gave me medication to deal with Crohn's and I had to drastically change my habits - eat healthier, workout regularly, avoid trigger foods, etc.  August 2012 - I was back to 145lbs.    


Fall 2012, I was back to my healthy weight - no more pain and poopy underwear, but still have some depression and emotional/ confidence damage from Crohn's.  But not longer on anti-depressants and no longer on Crohn's medication because I took care of my body and diet.  December 31st, I was at the dinner table and notice the left side of my dad's face was drooping. I was studying for MCATs, remember?  I did some basic eye movement test, finger coordination test, and strength test and diagnosed my dad had a stroke.  We took him to the ER and had CT and MRI and Xray.  Jan 1st 2012 He was further diagnosed that he had a stroke due to a tumor that blocked blood flow - the type of tumor he had was Glioblastoma Stage 2, encapsulated (luckily). I was studying a lot for MCATS  


Spring 2013, January my dad had surgery - the survival and success rate was 50%.  I was back into my depression. I took my First MCATs and did not get the score I wanted 27.  I was in depression and started drinking, doing drugs, isolating myself.  I still try to see my dad in the hospital, but not as often as a good son should.  I could not accept this is happening to my dad, and to be okay I had to convince my dad won't make it in order to function normally.  I was still going to school full-time and studying for MCATS.   My dad survived the surgery, but now has to go through Chemo and radiation for a year.  I felt ashamed that I didn't have any faith in my dad surviving and that I was a shitty son because I only visited him at the hospital and home about twice a week. I would rather choose to drink and smoke pot on the weekend than visit my dad and face all that misery. I was put on the alcohol abuse and suicide watch list at school - I was required to see a therapist, go to meetings, and other stuff.  My best friend was there for me through this and talked to me everyday to see if I was okay.   


Summer 2013.  It was torturous watching my dad get thinner and thinner and lose weight and have no appetite and not in the mood to do anything.  He had his chunk of his frontal lobe cut out and his movements and mobility was poor, and cognitive function was all messed up and radiation doesn't help.  I was slowly getting out of my depression because 1) my dad is still alive 2) I am still here.  I started studying for MCATS exam in Fall.    


Fall 2013.  Took MCATS and didn't do well again got 27 points.  Still applied to medical and osteopathic school.  Got denied to all of them.  Really down on myself from the age of 11 to 21 all I wanted was become a doctor and I failed miserably - Depression again - but no drugs or alcohol - just didn't do anything - took easy classes and wasted time and hope to graduate.  Best friend was there for me.    


Spring 2014.  Started studying for MCATS one last time.  No more depression, just random bouts of negative thoughts.  I was just glad I was alive and my dad is alive. Graduate 3.69 GPA.   


Summer 2014.  Took MCATS one last time.  I spent 8 months studying.  got 28 points.  Not good enough for medical schools - got rejected.  Really down on my self again.  I have given my 110% - that's when I realize hardwork doesn't always pay off; hardwork increase the chances of a pay off.  My best friend, mom and dad was there for me and told me it is okay to not be a doctor, I have tried my best.  It was not meant to be.  Being a doctor is not an end-all-be-all. I felt really useless and felt like I wasted 10 years of my life for nothing.     


Fast forward to the Present Summer 2018.  I am a Data Manager for clinical testing and do statistics for them.  Published a few papers.  Getting paid well. Not a lot of debt. No depression.  Crohn's on Remission for a while now.  I have 1 year left on finishing my MPH degree in Biostatistics.   


Life works out somehow.  It's never the end.  I look back to those 3 rock-bottom years and realize if I can survive those years, then I am equipped to deal with anything in life.  The universe closes one door so you will realize there are many other doors open for you.  You just have to trust yourself and take the first step towards to unknown to create your own path.   


For people out there in a rough situation -  ""Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."".  Life is a cycle - if you are at your worst, then the good things are right behind it - just have to endure and persevere.  


TLDR; Crohns's, School, Depression, Dad with cancer, Not making into Medical school leading to alcohol, drugs and rock bottom years of my life.  But Life always work out, just not the way you want it to.  :)

What they are is mass produced ""affordable"" fast fashion that happens to be branded under a designer fashion house

Once you move past tees/slides and get into pieces with unique silhouettes and high quality materials, you begin to realize the appeal of designer/high fashion.  You begin paying for your clothes to be ***extremely unique*** in the most literal definition of the word.  1-of-1 runway pieces, hand died/painted fabrics, unique proportions that affect how the garment lays on your body, the highest quality leathers and hairs, etc...

Something like the Rick Owens aesthetic can't be achieved just from shopping at Target.  Same could be said for any of the *really nice* Gucci suits or runway pieces.  

If your only knowledge of ""designer fashion"" is Gucci slides and tees, then of course you wouldn't see the value in it.  Neither would I."

Got told off for essentially being an attention seeker and given the hours of detention appropriate for the number of assignments I hadn't done.

Another co-worker had also just quit.  It meant a lot of things were going to fall onto me (it was a very, very miserable 3 weeks with lots of overtime, but knowing that I still told my co-worker to ignore our boss).  My boss, however, despite knowing my co-worker was dealing with the death of her mother and the need for international travel, and knowing that my other-coworker was about to leave, didn't have any desire to compromise her vacation.  So somehow in her head it was okay for her to ask my co-worker to reschedule her mom's funeral.  I am just horrified anyone could be that insensitive."

I worked at one of the highest volume Honda Dealers in the country. We routinely did 600 cars a month between new and used during an average month. You were **expected** to sell at least 10 a month or you were gone. So me doing 17 a month was above average, but I was typically around 6th or 7th on the board. We had a guy who did 45 a month average. 

I'm not saying it was a good idea (it was a fucking terrible idea) but I can at least understand where their heads were at.....sort of. Plus this was during the Accord Challenge that Honda did right before they did the refresh. This clinic was designed to increase our survey scores across the whole dealership to assist in our 2013 Accord allocation. I was the only person who had to do it every week, but they had green peas helping me out sporadically, but never the same ones.

But here was the big thing. I knew I was making my money off volume, and gross deals when I could get it in used. But I routinely pissed off my sales manager and GM because I would often fight with them over deals. I truly believed that the way to grow my personal business was giving a deal that was fair to the customer and the dealership, that meant walking away from a home run sometimes and they hated that.

I didn't care, I could always look myself in the mirror and never feel guilty without having to say ""fuck them I got mine"" to myself, and I got a shit load of referrals, because they people knew they got a square deal,. They knew we didn't whore out the car to them, but they knew we didn't rake them over the coals.

Although I was good at my job, I realized at the end of the day I wasn't cut out for the car business. I won't shit on it, it opened up a lot of doors for me and gave me a skill-set. But frankly, I'm not money-motivated. I want enough to live comfortably, and I don't need more than that. The nature of the car business doesn't really allow for that kind of a mindset."

I recognize a lot of women welcome these kinds of compliments, so long as they're not predatory. But personally, I think they're still disrespectful, simply because a man wouldn't treat another man as a creature that should be complimented and flattered on sight. You would treat them as an equal, and that sometimes means keeping your mouth shut, especially if you don't know them."

I used to refer to her as Slut #1 (there was two of them who made a pact to lose their virginity before the end of the first semester, and boy did they). I had only met her a couple times, and she was a stuck up bitch, but even she didn't deserve this. 

So in this class along with her are two of her best friends, and a guy who lived in the same dorm building. He knew all of them, and they had friends in common. Well there was an assignment for a poem, that everyone knew would have to be read in front of the entire class. This guy proceeds to write a poem about;

1. how he hooked up with Slut #1 in the very public jacuzzi of their dorm area ( a former hotel turned into dorms so it had a small pool and jacuzzi) 
2. how great it was and in explicit detail what they did
3. how the condom broke
4. how he had to go buy plan B and split the cost of her
5. how expensive it was to split the cost with her (I guess $20 some off bucks is a lot for a college freshman)
6. how he then went on to hook up with one of her roommates and how said roommate was better in bed

He did all of this knowing that she was in class, that two of her best friends were in the class, and that there were several other people who knew her or lived in their dorm area in the class. Needles to say that is one class I will always remember, and I'm sure she will too. Hell, I was embarrassed for her. It was mortifying.  We all just kept looking at each other like we couldn't believe this was happening. All the students knew who the poem was about. Slut #1 had hooked up with him knowing the roommate liked him, and it became a big deal within the friend group and in that dorm building. The teacher wasn't thrilled, but technically he met all the qualifications but I have never seen a grown man more uncomfortable in my life.

We also had another assignment where you put three important/ meaningful items into a box and exchanged it with another person in class to write a poem about the other person. He got paired with a very Christian student. All he put in his box was condoms. She wrote a poem about how he was going to go to hell for his sins, and how much of a self-absorbed ass hat he was.  While those weren't read aloud she let me read it, and it was awesome. "

14946,"That my grandfather killed my uncle because he thought the child was not his. Then my grandmother had another baby (my father) who they passed off as the dead child. 

Edit - I’ll add a bit more but I don’t know a whole lot as I don’t feel right asking as it’s a touchy subject.  

My grandfather and grand mother married in early 1950s. My grandfather was in the army and stationed in Germany. This was during the Korean War but he didn’t go over there. 

His mother was sick and came home early to be with her. His wife became pregnant but he didn’t think the time worked out and the baby wasn’t his so he shot the baby with his pistol and said he was cleaning it and it was an accident. I don’t know if the baby was his or not. 

They then had another baby (my dad) and never went to the hospital and just passed my dad as the other baby. We think my dad is about two years younger than his birth certificate says. 

This all came out when my grandfather died and my grandmother was still alive. My dad already knew but didn’t really talk about it and still doesn’t. "

I didn't know how to be normal. 

That dude assaulted me as a full grown man. I was in muay Thai and western boxing for like over two years in total and I lifted weights.  This guy is a twiggy drug addict and drunk. I had years worth of hate fly out of my limbs hitting this guy. He attacked me and I socked him in the mouth before he could touch me. I lost it and just pummeled him, spit in his face and called him a bitch himself. Then I instantly felt sick with myself. I normally don't let my rage out like that but I did.  

Fuck it. I strive to be better everyday. I came from shit but I refuse to be a complete product of my environment. "

We had planned things like where we would live, how many kids we would have, what kind of dogs we would own, basically planned our entire life out. Well when we hit our anniversary I asked him about our life he saw and he said I don’t know. I asked when we would move in together he said in 3 years. I asked if we would get married he said I don’t think that’s an option for at least 5 years. Well my final question was do you even see a future with me to which his answer was I don’t know.

He thought me working as one when I could have one was beneath me. Now, nearly 2 years after leaving him, I don't necessarily have a great job but I'm no longer on minimum wage and I've gained a sense of ambition/direction/independence which he never allowed me to have."

14989,"There was this book I read when I was about 12 and it was about people who have inner fairies that give people helpful abilities. So our protagonist, 12 year old Charlie, has one that lets her get a parking space no matter what. Super useful right?

Well, everyone wants to her sit in their cars, and one particular boy is a pushy meathead. As a result, she hates her fairy. 

It's messed up. The school she goes to is something out of a authoritarian's wet dream. Even the calories are regulated and if they're out of place you get into serious trouble. And if she gets into trouble she has to do community service until late hours AND be expected to finish this mind-breaking workload of homework. All at 12 years old. And this is not questioned at all. What kind of kid would want to go to a school like that? Isn't a fantasy novel supposed to have some pull into, ""Hey, I wanna live in that world!""  
Oh, that's not the worst part. At one point the creepy boy basically kidnaps her so he can get a good parking space somewhere. And he goes to the same school, where they even regulate calories, and the school does... nothing. Just a hand wave at the end that he'll get a stern talking to.

Charlie's not exactly a bed of roses either. She whines and whines throughout the book. She hates a girl because she has a weird name and is rich. Until it turns out that the rich girl's mom can transfer fairies or something. Then Charlie loves this girl!  
So Charlie gets a new fairy. Except this one causes every boy to fall in love with her. Even the gay boys. Unfortunate implications ahoy, mateys!

Charlie has to get rid of these fairies so she goes on a death-defying ride down a toboggan. And then she loses both of her fairies. Instead of reflecting on how her stupid little stunt almost got her killed, she whines about not having any fairies. 

Except she does get a fairy. One that helps her with her favorite sport, basketball. Remember kids! You can't achieve anything through your own sweat and skill! No, no, just get a deus ex machina fairy that helps you cheat! Horrible.

Oh, I almost forgot. This book had its own confusing, stupid slang. All in an index at the end. Wow, I love trying to getting immersed in a world and having to check what a made-up word is supposed to mean because you really needed that quirky angle."

1. When I taught 8th grade, I had to insist that a photo of a koala bear off Google Images would NOT serve as a proper paper title.
2. Just a sad one... one student half-assed a paper with a fully MLA formatted first page, two sentences, and an ""I'm sorry, Mrs. LancerLandshark.""
3. The paper wasn't bad, but despite going over APA title pages AT LENGTH in class, I had a student who turned in their APA paper with a teal-and-turquoise book-like MS Word cover template that was gaudy and had very little of the required info.
4. I can think of many where the writing was just poor or didn't have proper grammar, but one goof from a recent semester sticks out in terms of errors in writing. The student did a good poetic analysis of the poem ""Because I Could Not Stop For Death,"" cited it correctly as by Emily Dickinson, yet all throughout the paper referred to the poet as Elizabeth Dickerson.

Also, in one that doesn't at all count amongst my worst but may be one of my most memorable, I assigned a paper with the goal of arguing successfully for both sides then mediating it as an advancement of lessons in argumentation. Most students chose from a list of very serious and difficult-to-solve problems, but one student requested to do a paper on the ""are hot dogs sandwiches?"" debate. It was an impeccable paper that did reach a nice mediation, but it was also incredibly memorable among papers on drug epidemics and immigration questions."

We weren’t going fast and all had time to get a good look at it as we drove by, so I know it wasn’t a hallucination. Also, my father has no imagination and he saw it too. Mind you, we were in the middle of nowhere on the Blue Ridge parkway. This was back it ‘94 and portable HD projectors weren’t really a plausible explanation. (Besides, it was clearly a tunnel, or maybe an archway. The perspective moved parallax as we passed.)

Literally, when i cut a powercable that was powering a 80 amp electric engine. 380 volts and 80 amps of pure goodness flowed through my heart while i was suspended about 20 feet in the air hanging of a gurder. Prior, my coworker ensured me he cut the power to that cable. I'm pretty sure i saw a tunnel. Closing down, quite fast. I could hear myself screaming, after that everything was black for a minute.

The amount of shrapnel stuck in my face from the cable cutter that exploded, the plastic insulation that burned through my skin on my right hand, and the fact that they had to pry me off that cable gutter because all the muscles in my left arm where cramped up and not going to move for another hour or so, was quite traumatizing.

As i lied down on the floor waiting for my heart to give out all blood left my skin and i started to turn into a ghost.

My heart didnt explode. I went home after a short trip to the hospital to remove the shrapnell and got stitches where needed.

I crawled in bed and stayed there for about a week before color in skin returned and i quit my job right after that.

Left arm is still fucked up. Cant lift it over my head. Heart is fine. No scars apart from where they cut the red insulation plastic from my hand."

We went out one night, she met this man and decided it was time to go home. I was staying at her place so I went with them. As soon as we walked through the front door, his pants were down and she was straight up sucking his dick, I let her dog outside and sat out with him, they continued to have sex by the front door for a while, and the whole time I just sat outside with the dog with the door closed to try and mute the disgusting noises.

15309,"I'm waging a one man war against about half the staff.

Working nights at a hotel, I'm not generally awake when they hold meetings, nor do I see very much of the management team. So about half my coworkers are getting into this habit of saying, ""WELL, WHY NOT HAVE NIGHT AUDIT DO IT?"" They believe in their hearts that my night is spent sitting around playing online or watching TV. In reality, while I do get considerable downtime, it's because I need to fix any issues that pop up *entirely on my own*. On a bad night, I barely have enough time to do my actual job and handle all the guest complaints.

Imagine my dismay realizing that in the last year my workload has nearly doubled.

So for the last 2 months I've been emailing management almost daily to express either that I had to make a choice about what work got DONE, or to explain to them as professionally as possible that such and such a task is not really a feasible addition to my shift for such and such a reason... In effect, diplomatically telling them to take that task and shove it up *someone else's* ass.

I am not currently popular with my coworkers, but I have such a solid track record that none of them can openly speak out against me without cutting their own throats."

15359,"The pace in which we wanted to move forward in life was on totally different parts of the spectrum. I wanted to move fast because life is short, but he wanted to go slow for security.

It mainly happened because we argued over a date we were planning for our 5th anniversary, which was an overnight trip in a resort out of town for just the two of us. This was gonna be the first time we would ever be out overnight without anyone else. For context, he was raised in a very conservative family so the idea of this is uncomfortable for him. It was only after all the plans were set did he call off and suggest another plan, so needless to say I was very upset.

Long story short: I was fed up and decided I didn't want to spend my life with anyone who isn't willing to move forward with our life together. I was appalled at the thought of him suggesting I move in with his family (which all share the same sentiments as him that I don't agree with) and live the sheltered, dependent life. Noped out of that one real quick, and suggested we have a long, deep talk about how to move our relationship forward.

We met up and had a big talk shortly after. The purpose of that talk was to find middle ground, and we did eventually agree on a list of things we would do together to help each other move forward at the pace we wanted. There were a lot of big things I had to give up, but in exchange there were also a lot of things he had to force himself to do, mostly growing out of the sheltered shell he'd grown accustomed with. We've been alright since then, and we've already crossed out a bunch from that list so it's a good sign altogether.

A good comparison I used to explain our differences to my friends is the credit vs. cash situation. I like to get my items immediately, so I pay for it using credit just so I can have the item now, even if I have to pay extra for it. Meanwhile, he prefers to take his time and save up the cash for the item, even if it takes months or years to get enough, because at least by then he would be sure to get the item at the end of the saving period. It was incompatible in many ways, and there's really no moving forward unless something was done about it.

TL;DR my SO wants to move as slow as he can while I want to go as fast as possible with the relationship. Obviously incompatible, so we sat and forced middle ground until both of us are satisfied."

So I'm sitting at home eating some cereal when my phone rings, I don't recognize the number so I hesitate picking up, but something tells me to give the mystery caller a chance. I answer the phone and it's Opie on the other end, he and I hadn't talked for a couple months beforehand but his tone seemed like the call had more of a purpose than just idle chat and catching up.

Opie says he's on *Who wants to be a millionaire* and asks me the name of a 70s show featuring David Hasselhof as a bartender. The show rings a bell - but I cannot for the life of me remember it. I think for a minute and believe I've remembered the name - *Playful Tag*. 

I relay this information to Opie, who answers the question. Turns out the name was not quite right, and Opie gets bumped down to a less significant sum of money. Still a win, but he would've won quite a bit more had Opie put A Serious Tag."

He genuinely seems to think I'm attractive and has better that average vision. (?)

I'm 10 years older than him and was a 7 at best only with lots of makeup on, and am now decaying into my late 30s and disappeared as far as society goes once I hit 35.

He has a marble statue body and thick juicy thighs and lifts weights. He thinks this is normal because everyone he knows was or is a swimmer.

I can't even float and look like Tina Fey but am a skeleton with a food baby made of chips and obsessed with eating and weird hobbies.

I dunno how he's into any of my physical husk things other than maybe darkness and alcohol. 

I sucked him into my web 5 years ago via my sense of humor.

Everyone tells me how hot he is and kind of gives me a wtf look when they first him. Don't know if I like or hate that."

The whole book he talks about how ‘he’s just an observer’ in the events and watches them without interaction or judgement, but that’s a lie. He’s just as much a character as everyone else, and has the ability to act, only he chooses not to. In this sense, he can be seen as a metaphor for the lower classes and the way they are content to accept the upper classes fucking up repeatedly without doing anything about it."
15455,"We change the menu up weekly and I'm pretty sure that week we were serving (Ironically) peppercorn steak. It was basically strip steak with a sauce (can't remember exactly but think it was a borderlaise) with an absolute fuck ton of peppercorns in the pot to extract the flavour. And when pouring the sauce over the steak a lot of peppercorn came with it. obviously these are supposed to be moved out of the way unless you REALLY REALLY love the taste of pepper. and there was a layer about half as thick as the steak itself (thin cut but definitely not tiny)

I could not handle listening to so much raw fear and grief. The call that made me quit was a woman who reported she'd stabbed her kids. Totally emotionless about it. Her mother (whom she'd called before calling 911) arrived on the scene. 911 operator gets on the phone with grandma, 911 asks her to check on her grandchildren. Grandma goes to the kids' room and starts screaming. 

It just got worse from there. The kids' dad is  home but sleeping in the basement. Cops wake him up. He is nowhere near the phone - grandma is outside in front of the house at this point - you could *still* hear that man howling with grief.

He and his wife were divorcing and she was afraid he would call her crazy and get custody of the kids.

On that day - her husband's birthday - she decided to murder her children and then kill herself. She chickened out when it was time to stab herself with the knife.

Even the 911 operator started crying. I think he was hoping this woman just thought she killed those kids. 

And damned if I'm not crying again just remembering.

So yeah. I can appreciate how listening to the aftermath of a tragedy is nothing anyone should deliberately expose themselves to.

I think this guy was from Florida and he was chatting with a model online. They eventually planned a trip to Thailand together and meet up for the first time. He checks into the hotel room when he arrives and gets a call from the girl saying that she was at the hotel waiting for him but she got a call for a big modeling gig in Belgium so she had to quickly leave to go over there. She asked for him to meet her there instead and that she also forgot one of her suitcases in the hotel room and if he could bring it over for her.  So he decided to bring the suitcase and fly on over to Belgium. 

When he got to the airport the police found that the suitcase had been lined with a bunch of hardcore drugs.  (course he did not know this)

Thailand is particularly strict regarding smuggling drugs because of the Golden Triangle region.  The poor dude got arrested and had to go to jail for a few years. "

15611,"This one is not creepy so much as just frustrating, because it involves a place and perhaps an entire route seemingly disappearing out of nowhere. It was about 11 or 12 years back, so I was a teenager. My dad, my sister, her friend and I were having a beach day, driving from NY to Westerly, RI. At the time none of this seemed weird but apparently we took I-84 all the way there (it was one of the rare times I got shotgun on a road trip so I was paying attention to the drive) and hit MASSIVE traffic on the way. I remember vividly being stuck in traffic near some mountains and thinking that was weird since weren't we going to the beach? 

Then on the way back we took some back road and while we were still in RI stopped at this seafood place. Dad had said it was an all you can eat place, and I loved seafood, so I was hyped. But there were next to no cars there so he wanted to go in first and see if it was open, check prices, etc. 

He came out saying we weren't eating there because it was $64 a person. I remember thinking holy shit, that can't be right, after all it was 2006-07ish and my naive self had never been to a place that cost more than $15 a person to eat. 

Years later I moved to New London, CT, which is right near the CT-RI border and half an hour from the beach in Westerly. I now realize that either my memories from that day are fucked up or we went somewhere that doesn't exist. Westerly is off I-95, not 84, and I have tried several times to find that seafood place but I never was able to find it. 

Dad confirmed the place existed but he couldn't remember the name. I haven't asked about the I-84/mountains/traffic thing but now I'm thinking it might be time to do some research on that... 

EDIT: So I did the research and apparently the place was called Custy's in Stonington, it's a lobster buffet and it's still in business, and apparently the best kept secret since I lived in Groton/NL for two years and never heard of it. Also dad swears up and down we took 84 to CT-2, but I still don't think I believe that simply because we'd have passed foxwoods if that was the case and I'd have remembered that. 🤔"

.

While I was out, I saved an eleven year old boy's life. He got sucked out into open ocean (near San Francisco). His wetsuit was a shortie, he was on a small cheapo boogieboard with no fins on his feet, and nobody noticed he was out there... except the only guy in the water, the guy that was supposed to be showing up at the psych ward. I spent 15 minutes towing him back to shore, giving him lessons on currents, wave dynamics, board control, etc to keep him calm and distracted. When I finally got out of the water an hour later, his parents thanked me in the parking lot- he'd told them the whole story. I gave them some beach advice, encouraged them to buy him proper equipment and let him get back out there"

While doing rounds my partner told me how he had matched with a girl on Tinder and wanted to see if he could meet up with her if we had some downtime later in the night. Well it got pretty busy, this was around the time that the Orange Tesla pills came out (google if you don't know) and we had to tend to the college students who were unaware of the high MDMA content and needed medical attention after taking 2+ pills at once. One girl in particular at the medical tent was rolling off her rocker, laying on the ground and pounding her hands on the floor exclaiming how happy she was to be a ""fishy in the sea"" inbetween asking passersby if they would ""be a fish with her."" My partner and I became in-charge of feeding her water and making sure she didn't run away/hurt herself. A little while into it my partner mutters to me ""oh God.. it's [name of aforementioned girl from Tinder]"" I suppose he hadn't realized it at first because she looked a bit different from her pics? I nearly didn't believe it until she shouted ""Hey I know you!!!"" at him before retorting back to her fish world. It was definitely an eye opening experience to what MDMA can do to people when taken in excess, and felt like a sitcom moment how my partner ended up finding out the fish -- er, girl he had wanted to meet up with, we ended up babysitting..."

15673,"Right after my dad died I came home and tried to cope with it in healthy ways. Because, after my mom died the year before that, I basically stopped functioning.

My husband... Didn't recognize that I was trying really hard to do my best. I came back home after three weeks of taking care of 30+ years worth of house and nothing had been done. But I wanted to live a more peaceful, happier life, so I let it go. I worked every day to do something and I still got comments -- ""you didn't do this"" and ""you didn't do that"". It hurt.

Things came to a head and we got into a really ugly, horrible fight. I'd been trying to be emotionally mature and I just broke down and started slinging shit too. Things calmed down but nothing really changed, and he stooped to a lot of emotional abuse that I'm still not 100% over.

We're trying to fix things now. Firstly, because there was a reason we loved each other in the first place. Partially because I didn't want to spend the last nine years only to lose EVERYTHING after just recently losing the two most important people in my life. Also because he seemed to recognize what he did and how it hurt me. We talked a lot about that and I'm willing to work on it one last time to see if things really can change.

We went to a counselor. It helped a little.

We'd argue and eventually go off into separate rooms. He stews things over, I process and try to see it from his point of view. I'd then go and talk to him and stay calm when he'd get angry again. Eventually my staying calm, calms him and he'll open up.

Now I've learnt the warning signs, so I don't get angry with him, I'm also more confident and trusting in our relationship, we've been together nearly 6 years, are buying a house and planning on getting married. I know he loves me, I don't have the insecurities from my past anymore (abusive ex), so when he does get a mood I ask him about his day, and listen (even though I don't understand much about his work) or I'll set up the good tv with whatever game he's currently playing and chill some beers in the fridge. When he's ready he'll talk it through with me. I don't push it anymore but I also don't let him stew to the point he explodes.

I had a neighbor when I was 8 who used to take me and my siblings to church. He was nice and we'd go over to his house all the time because he'd make stuff for us and feed us and stuff. He was old and married and had grandchildren that would come over sometimes. Gave me my first Bible. 

I thought he was a friend until he molested me. I didn't understand what was happening because he just put his hand down my pants and kind of touched. He asked me if I liked it and I was just kind of frozen, I said yes. He told me to never tell anyone, it was our secret. I kind of hate myself for that, for not knowing better. He didn't rape me or something more ""serious"" so I guess I just kind of put it aside. It happened once more after this.

Later on I was playing truth or dare with my sisters and I picked truth, they asked what my deepest darkest secret was. I told them, and luckily one of them told my dad. Parents are separated, this happened at my mom's. He called my mom and flipped shit on her. She had no idea. They gave me talks afterwards.

15853,"I worked part-time at an ""adult store"" for a couple years for some extra income. It was 10:30 p.m. on a slow Tuesday night and I was wiping down the counter when two guys barged in wearing hoodies, bandanas around their faces, waving a gun.

I'm not gonna lie, I just kinda...froze up. Went blank. I stood there and stared at them and they repeated the demand to open the register, then when I wasn't moving fast enough, one of them LEAPT over the four-foot high counter like a fucking spider-monkey (to this day I am still impressed by that leap - it only left one single, perfect boot imprint on the counter. I may or may not have tried to recreate that leap a few weeks later on another slow night and definitely failed hard, so props to that criminal, that was a high ass counter to vault over in a single bound).

I opened the drawer, put up my hands, and backed away. They took the money out of the drawer, then made me go out from behind the counter and get on my knees with my hands behind my head. This was the first time I started actually panicking, because now I had this mental image of getting shot execution-style over fucking dildo money, of all things. Turns out, they actually wanted me to get on my knees and then lay down on the floor so  I couldn't watch while they ran out of the store and made their getaway.

I waited about two minutes, got up, and alerted the police by using the panic button under the counter (which did not cross my mind ONCE while I was actually being robbed, damn it, it's like I didn't even remember that button until afterwards) because they had ripped the phone out of the wall.

The worst part of the whole scenario? The assholes took my purse and phone from the counter. This was the a hugest pain in the ass out of everything - the next day, I had to cancel my bank cards, order new insurance cards, get a new phone, get a new driver's license, get copies of every single key for my job, house, and car... I couldn't even get into my house that night, I had to break in through the back door.

The real kicker? I never, ever carry any cash and I had a whopping $6 on my bank card, so they didn't even get anything worthwhile. Hope you enjoyed the floral, Vera Bradley-knockoff, assholes."

Need to eat more? Eat until you feel like puking then keep eating, especially if you’re going to be active that day.

Need to eat less? You’ll be full for a bit and then your stomach basically hurts because it’s empty again

I’m not even talking giant swings in weight, I was 100 lbs and needed to get to 115-120 to be healthy and then beer happened and I was 170 looking to lose my gut.

15882,"The 2002 VMAs happened to coincide with Michael Jackson's 44th birthday, and the producers thought it would be a nice occasion for some torch-passing — in this case, with birthday wishes (and a cake!) presented by Britney Spears. But Jackson, while standing backstage, heard Spears refer to him as the ""artist of the millennium,"" which led to him thinking he'd won a newly minted award with the same name. (The gift, which looked like a trophy, if not one of MTV's Moonmen, probably helped further confuse matters.) His sweet acceptance speech — which included thanks to David Blaine — confused the audience at first, but they eventually rolled with it enough to give him a screamy ovation.

In my ongoing replay of the series, Infinite's main problem is it isn't a Bioshock game. Bioshock is as much downfall and desolation as it is everything else. it's a quiet game. I took count of my kills through my latest playthrough of 1. Without exception, they were in the low to mid double digits per level. Compare this to the huge battles of Infinite. You don't really explore Infinite in the same way, you aren't piecing it together, and the plot doesn't have the same feeling of exotic containment."

My friend and I understood them just fine through their accents, so we helped the woman at ht counter sort out their tickets and got them set up with a comp room down the hall from us.  In the morning we took a cab with them and got them on their flight.  Everyone we talked to swore that they were not speaking English and I'll be damned if the counter we had been at with them was not a uninstalled hole in the wall the next day.  To this day I'm not sure what happened with them, but I'm glad we were there to help. "

If you go there enough, it wears off and a lot of people use it as a paintball course. "

There was NO separation between sink and urinal but whatever. There was also a dude taking a shit in a stall with a broken door 2 feet from me.

So I'm pissing and this fat, smelly hillbilly comes up and starts unpacking a plastic bag. In it, a rusty razor, rusty can of shaving cream and what looked like an old sock. (edit, forgot to mention he took off his shirt and started shaving his chest with no gel or cream on. Dry shaved...) Then he stares directly at my dick and says ""no worries I won't grab ye dick, I'm done with that. And who's this n****er shittin in my stall?"". I freak out (I'm skinny and young, he's large and old and racist) so I start to nope the fuck out and leave. On my way out of the bathroom I just tried splashing my hands with water and when turning the sink on, cockroaches crawl out. Outloud I say ""fuck this place"" and pretty much ran away.

Then the shop owner came out to me as I'm walking out and says ""not buying nothing? Thanks for using our water dick head!"" so I walked outside, filled up on gas and finished pissing outside next to the gas pump.

How do places like that stay in business, Jesus. Health hazards, rape vibes, etc.

My girlfriend has never seen me so shaken but damn did the fight or flight response kick in super hard in that moment.

Random details that add to the story : my GPS worked 100% of my trip until I pulled into the station, then it turned off immediately. There was a giant green dinosaur out front that stared at the entrance of the gas station. It was pitch black outside and the gas pumps didn't auto stop so my tank overflowed and cost me an extra $5... Ugh fuck that gas station seriously "

This is actually an obnoxious social trait that I've noticed a lot lately, but I don't think it's a new one. I think people just get embarrassed when they're proven wrong, so they latch onto something that makes it seem like the person who proved them wrong is guilty of some sort of pernicious moral failing. It's the, ""You don't have to rub it in,"" response, except that initially contradicting someone is not ""rubbing it in"", and even if I *were* rubbing it in, that doesn't make the incorrect thing *less* incorrect. Spreading false and dangerous information is always worse than being a sanctimonious pedant in the process of correcting that information. 
 
Literally no one is out there arguing with anti-vaxxers for the sole reason of making anti-vaxxers look dumb in public. They're arguing with anti-vaxxers because anti-vaxx is an *extremely misinformed and dangerous belief* that has already resulted in the resurgence of debilitating and deadly diseases and the subsequent suffering, debilitation, and/or death of many people (mostly children) who would otherwise have been *fine*.

I'm not linking this Snopes article in order to demonstrate that I'm somehow ""better"" than you; I'm linking it because you're wrong and spreading dangerous misinformation that will cause people to get hurt. Just admit that you're wrong, stop spreading misinformation, and try to do better in the future. If you see someone spreading the same thing, link them to the article.

A giant crowd of hecklers formed and threw rocks and snowballs and blocks of ice at him and the other soldiers, and dared them to fire back at them.

I remember going to the water fountain by myself and seeing a man leaning against the metal gate with beer cans around him. I just stared at him, wandering what he was doing. He was turned away from me so I never saw his face. Well one of the teachers or some adult found me and they saw the man also. I remember being rushed back into the class and looking out the window and seeing sheriff deputies and other official looking people. My mom came and picked me up and all I wanted to know was if our deputy neighbor Dave was outside working. Maybe because it  was the mid 80s or whatever reason my mother never talked about what was going on. A few years later I found out that the man hung himself on the gate. I still think about him every now and then. Did he have a wife and kids and how often does it weigh on there mind? "

16022,"A few years back I met a guy with a kid at the museum. We happened to click and the kids seemed to like each other. He made a couple comments about how nicely our kids were playing together because his son really does not play much with others, and another comment about how well behaved and polite my kids were. 

We made a couple dates with no kids and a couple dates with kids. One time I went over to their house for dinner. My kids were at their dads house and I got to experience this kid in full force. We were eating dinner and his son, who was 8, took one bite and said, ""Peace out suckas!"" and left the dinner table. Then he went to play with legos and brought a whole bunch onto the table while we were eating. He says, ""Dad, my plate is in the way"". Dad moves the plate. Then the kid gets more toys and starts playing in the living room. Dad says, ""You should put the legos away first."" Kid says, ""Yeah right. Thats  your job"". Dad did it! While he was picking up his kids mess I started washing the dishes. I asked, ""Should I cover kids plate and stick it in the fridge for later?"" he responds, ""Oh no, he will ask for waffles later and I'll make them. Just toss it"" 

I realized that this kid was never told no. This kid didn't have any rules or chores. He was just awful. I broke it off by saying that we had completely different parenting styles and I don't think we should go any further."

Afterward, he apologized but explained that on the two occasions he had to deploy the reserve it was a very uncomfortable, scary and unpleasant experience.

Anyway, in the next lesson one of my fellow students asked about wearing a GoPro... The instructor said ""Sure, you just need to do 200 jumps first."" He then outlined why they'd come up with that number. A lot of people have died trying to point their helmet to get a good shot apparently...

16057,"Not a psychiatrists but relevant experience. Background: My mother had graduated top of her class , she had always been an outstanding student and was a respiratory therapist. At the age of 35 she started drinking , she was a SEVERE alcoholic for the next ten years. In that time she developed Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome , also known as ''Wet Brain''.  This presented itself in only what I can describe as seemingly possessed. She wouldn't eat for days , I often found her crawling on all fours through the kitchen opening cabinets in search for ANYTHING edible. She would wake up from a dead sleep and run into my bedroom with excitement and start yelling things like ''Happy Mother's day'' or ''Happy Birthday'' , it was neither of those days. Her sleep was inconsistent. Her entire personality changed , she lost memories , she became extremely selfish in a child like way. She would experience these episodes which seemed to last all day , she described them as not being able to tell if the day was real or not. She had to stop going to therapy because she couldn't ever remember what was talked about last time which made her paranoid that people were lying to her or planting false memories in her head. This condition took away my mother. I came to terms with this about a year before she passed. She stared at me with a blank face , crying and said '' I don't even have a favorite color'' , she had just become a shell of someone I had loved. "

I still refer to many of the people from that generation as ""my kids"" even though they're all adults now.

We had been really good friends, but by the time I heard about these relationships, we'd grown apart. After that I avoided them, although I still have several friends in common, so I get updates from them and until recently most of us were Facebook friends.

The shocking thing, to me, is how it was happening right under my nose, and how minor everyone seemed to think it was. That these grown men were perusing girls in high school and the reaction is kind of like 'well, you know how it is."" And I don't know how that is at all.

In protest the dept boss made a HUGE printout of the schedule &amp; hung it on the wall by the executive break room to show how impossible our project was.

* Manitoba’s Child and Family Services says it will not erase the file of a Winnipeg mother who was investigated for letting her children play in her backyard.

The agency would not comment on the specifics of the case of Jacqui Kendrick, a stay-at-home mother of three. But regardless of the results of their investigation, the agency said it would not erase the file because all documentation and records need to be accessible in the event that another concern arises in the future.

Kendrick told CTV Winnipeg earlier this week that a CFS worker showed up unexpectedly at her door in early April and told her they were doing a “well-being check.” She said the agency had received a complaint about her children being left unsupervised.


Kendrick’s three children, ages two, five and 10, regularly play in the family’s backyard after school. The yard is fully fenced in, with a wood fence covering three sides, and a portion of the front covered by a chain link fence and gate. Kendrick told CTV Winnipeg she's always either with her kids or looking in on them from her living room windows and feels “completely comfortable” letting her kids play outside.

* (CNN)A Maryland family -- the subjects of national headlines when they were accused of neglect for letting their children, ages 6 and 10, walk home alone from a park -- are under investigation again. This time, the children were taken into custody by police officers and held for hours by police and Child Protective Services, according to the family.

* A Texas mom started a parenting debate this month, blogging about her six-year-old playing outside by himself.

She described her shock and anger when police and Child Protective Services came knocking on her door, CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez reports.

Kari Anne Roy knows all about the joys and challenges of raising a child. She has three of them. Her youngest -- six-year-old Isaac -- recently gained the privilege of playing outside alone for a few minutes.

Isaac said his rules were laid out for him: don't go past ""the top of the hill where the stop sign is.""

But a seemingly well-intentioned neighbor brought Isaac back home one day.

""There was this kind of disconnect there that I was smiling and saying, 'yes he was outside playing' and she was like, 'well, he was outside by himself' and I said, 'yes he was outside by himself playing, as six-year-olds do,'"" Roy said.

But it didn't end there. Soon, Roy had another knock on the door: a police officer who questioned her, but left. A few days later, Child Protective Services (CPS) arrived and questioned each of her children.

* In Austin, Kari Anne Roy, 38, a children’s author, was investigated for neglect after her children walked the dog one day in August and her 6-year-old lagged behind, playing on an outdoor bench a few houses down the street.

In Port St. Lucie, Fla., Nicole Gainey, 35, a mother of two, was arrested for letting her 7-year-old son walk alone to a park and play there, about half a mile away from their home in the town where she grew up.

One of most the most publicized recent cases involved Debra Harrell in North Augusta, S.C., who allegedly allowed her 9-year-old daughter to play at a park while she worked at a McDonald’s as a shift manager.

* A Winnipeg mom was doing the dishes while her three kids, 10, 5 and 2 , played in their fenced-in backyard.

A neighbor called to report “unattended” kids frolicking and Jacqui Kendrick was visited by a child protective services rep. The rep asked questions about what Jacqui’s own childhood was like, how she punished her kids, and where they slept. She even looked in Jacqui’s fridge.

You would think it was in good intention, but it was hard for us to take it seriously when we found out he was stealing from his own company. Money that was supposed to go into the company, was going into his pocket.  
And it didn't help that it seemed like he just expected us to suddenly work with more motivation just because he showed us that ""motivational"" presentation. There was not even some speech from his part, he'd just show us the presentation and that's it. Like what the fuck are you expecting us to just jump up with joy or something?

16141,"When I found out he was emotionally cheating on me with a girl from his job. 

My husband doesn't have female friends, so when he oh-so-casually mentioned Tiffany borrowing his GOT DVDs, I was instantly suspicious. 

It escalated to him turning the phone away to text her, and texting her after I would fall asleep. He started guarding his phone, and when I told him I was uncomfortable, he told me I was crazy and controlling. 

One day we went to his job to buy something, and he saw her, and I knew it was her because he smiled at her like she was sunshine after a year of rain. 

I was the fucking rain.

I confronted him and he got angry. He spent my birthday texting her. I spent weeks looking over his shoulder to find out his lock code.

One night he fell asleep without his phone tucked under him, so I took it. I unlocked it and the last message was how he was going to have to take care of her, because she can get wild. His response was that he wanted to see how wild she could get. 

And I broke. 

You see, I thought my husband and I were golden. Words can't describe how much I loved him, and the many (sometimes humiliating) things I'd done. But it wasn't enough. 

He woke up when he realized his phone wasn't in the bed. I threw the phone at the wall, in tears, and screamed at him for a divorce. He told me it was nothing, it didn't mean anything. He told me he wanted to tell her in person why he couldn't talk to her anymore, that she deserved that much. 

And I broke again. 

We stayed together. He supposedly stopped talking to her. Any time I randomly want, I'll take his phone and look at everything. 

I'm not over it, and he won't go to counseling. So he still gets angry when I bring it up, because I'm feeling vulnerable or devalued, or whatever. He tells me now that nothing was going to happen. That it wasn't that big of a deal. 

So I still look at him sideways sometimes. I'm not going anywhere, he's the best I'll ever find, and I don't consider it settling, because I don't want anybody else. 

But he broke us. It's the one thing that's happened we don't talk about, because it invariably causes hurt and anger. That's how we jerry-rigged it, nothing fixed. Just...avoided."

Or the time he hacked into the CIA and he got caught but rolled out the police car and cut his handcuffs.

16176,"You are completely misrepresenting the source. Here it is:

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/artificial-sweeteners-sugar-free-but-at-what-cost-201207165030

What it really does say is that the approved artificial sugars are currently shown to be safe. A research study done with *diet drinks* showed that daily consumption of diet drinks can increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. 

The reasons presented in the artical are completely contrary to what you apparently got from it. The article suggests that replacing some real sugars with artificial sugar can actually be a good way to lower caloric intake and manage weight loss. However, it also may lead to the consumer purchasing more sweets because they lose their sense that sweet = calories. People who have very sweet, no-sugar foods find that fruits and other sources of real sugar aren't even palatable because the taste of sugar is gone in comparison to artificial sweeteners.

So, as is reasonable, artificial sugars aren't linked to cancer or any diseases, as long as they are used in moderation. Don't drink lots of  diet soda everyday (or any soda for that matter) but feel free to use some sweetener in your coffee to reduce your caloric intake. "

16190,"From Redditor /u/gsnow:

“Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.
I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”"

16237,"Walmart literally killed at least a twenty businesses in my home town directly, and probably a dozen more indirectly.

My hometown is small but long. 8500 people stretched along a river with a bridge intersecting the town in the middle and the TransCanada highway running perpendicular to the north end of town.

Walmart had a location in our town's mall at the very edge of the Southside as long as I could remember. It was the anchor/flagship store. Because it was there, numerous other businesses had locations there, including a major grocery store, and in this case a rising tide really did lift all boats. You could buy shitty Walmart shoes and clothes, or go to the Sketchers and Northern Reflections.

Then, around 2002, Walmart announced they were shutting that store down and opening a SuperCenter within spitting distance of the highway in the North end of town. Many people fought it but the city council saw dollar signs from increased traffic from neighboring towns and signed on the dotted line.

That mall struggled on for a couple years as the businesses inside withered away, trying to find something to anchor the mall to no success. They demolished the mall building entirely in 2010. The lot has never been repurposed and is currently a weed ridden eyesore hole.

Not only did every business inside the mall close, they didn't reopen because without the mall they could not afford to buy and build their own standalone properties.

Furthermore, because the Walmart SuperCenter is now at the very North edge of town, the entire South side has basically died. Besides residential properties South of the bridge there is a gas station (of 3 that used to be there), a Tim Horton's/Wendy's combo, a convenience store that used to sell me cigarettes when I was underage, the (tiny) hospital and old folks home, and a reiki massage place. 2 dozen businesses including a car dealership got fucked by Walmart moving.

And it gets better. When Walmart was on the South side, visitors had to travel down our touristy main street patronizing lots of shops, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc.

Now that they are within spitting distance of the highway, main street has dried up like a dead bird in the sun. The only thing that keeping some of the family run businesses going is that fact that they outright own the buildings they are in and can cut down on that overhead.

Tl;DR version- In their quest for profits, Wal-Mart murdered the South end and middle of my home town."

16249,"I have the condition called Diabetes Insipidus. Basically, my brain tumor damaged the pituatary gland in my brain. That gland produces the hormone vasopressin. That hormones function is to retain water in the body. I was drinking gallons of water a day to replenish my fluids, but if I drank no water at all, it wouldn't prevent me from needing to urinate. I take medication for it now (desmopressin), but if I go off it for more than 8 hours, I will again begin urinating as much as I did back then. [If you want more info on the condition...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_insipidus)

Edit: On wikipedia, it says some with DI are known to urinate as much as[ 20 litres](https://4.imimg.com/data4/OU/LH/MY-2801063/20-litre-can-water-500x500.jpg) of urine a day.

16300,"This is good advice that the person giving didn't understand or just didn't have the patience to explain. It's more like this:

""Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions. The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you will not be harmed.""

 - Epictetus

Tl;dr: If you have no control over something ""bad"" change your perception/opinion of it. E.g. the death of a loved one, instead of dwelling on the loss and how unfair death is, perhaps celebrate the life of the person and your many cherished memories with them. Tomorrow is not promised to anybody. We are lucky to have shared time with the people we love. "

In 2011 I had my penis pierced, I was very happy with the result. The type of piercing i had, for reference purposes, was two dydoe type piercings( you can look it up on wikipedia but there will be a picture of a dong). About six months later I was with a girl in the shower and receiving what was otherwise an excellent blow job until one of my piercings got snagged on a tooth and ripped out. It was very painful and there was an intense amount of bleeding. The incident left quit the scar on my knob and the second piercing looked very strange in its asymmetry so i ended up removing it as well.

All I really have as evidence of his service is a 1943 photograph of him in his uniform, with his sister. My aunts have some documents somewhere.

Then he joined the Merchant Marine after the war, went to India, and drunkenly jumped into shark infested waters to rescue a drunker friend who had fallen off the gangplank and couldn't swim or something. He did not like India. He had some things to say about the treatment of women there.

Then his other family member Jackson Hewitt, as in the tax company had also would not give back his million dollars. And that he was also related to Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. This was all said to me within the first 5 minutes of meeting him. In reality though he had 10 to 15 children by prostitutes, which was actually true. Another lady thought at some point she pulled a tree limb out of her belly button and that someone must’ve stuck a tree in there when she wasn’t looking. 

There was a lot of crazy stories and were all very interesting people to talk to, but my most interesting person was a young man probably around his early twenties who had schizophrenia and anger and violence problems. He was a candidate to go to one of the state run psychiatric hospitals. He was the type that would do things like shoving pencils under his skin, cut him self or other self harm acts. My heart really broke for him because he would constantly say he would hurt himself because he didn’t want to hurt another person from his anger or violence issues, he wanted to be in the facility to get help and be safe. Not many people know what is going on is not the norm or try to act like nothing is wrong. But he was aware of his mental illness even though it was probably the most severe case I saw.

16378,"On a side note, at my old job they had transferred a guy to our store.   I didn't think anything about it and got along pretty well with him, but then I noticed that when the transfer paperwork came in, the person's name was clearly a female's name.   I called the other store they were transferring from and we spent a good 30 minutes on the phone trying to figure out why ""Don"" was showing up as ""Melissa"" in our system.  We kept trying to change it and the system wouldn't let us! 

That is when Don walked into the office and laughed at our struggle.  Turns out Don is transitioning from Melissa.  I laughed and said ""You could've told me this earlier and saved me this 30-minute headache!""   He responded with ""Well, I wasn't sure how you would take it.""

Before hand I had spent countless hours trying to train the new employees on the appropriate way to do things, and I had approached the manager with suggestions for improvement. It became abundantly clear that he just didn't give a fuck.

The lack of accountability and the general disregard for animal life was maddening. And let me be clear, I am not one of those people that are absolutely nuts about animals. I just feel like if it is your one fucking job to keep them alive then that is what should happen."

Captain clunge managed to:

1) Forget to adjust the switchboard so the laser thought there was a malfunction/leak

2) Open the valve to the cylinder too soon and actually cause a leak (toxic gas, given how stupid he was he might’ve actually killed himself if I wasn’t there)

3) Told the software/wizard that the cylinder exchange was complete before he had completed the exchange. 

All of this resulted in a laser unable to draw gas from the cylinder = dead laser.

16414,"In engineering.  Guy (I'll call him Tony) applies with a bit of unconventional resume and experience, but seemed interesting. He didn't have an an engineering degree, but he'd worked his way up from machinist and had 20+ years experience. He brought in a ton of portfolio work and explained how he'd set up these complex processes and improved several product designs. We ended up hiring him as a junior engineer and he was assigned to work with a few different engineers to help on their projects.

After working for a bit, Tony was a little difficult to explain things to, but would get things done after spending the time making sure he understood. However, he had this thing where he would never do it the same day. He would always be busy with something for someone else right then and would get to your stuff by tomorrow.

One day an engineer needed a very simple change to a design and asked him to make the change in our CAD software (in which he'd claimed to have years of experience and it is a ubiquitous minimum skill for the job.) Tony pulled his ""I'll get that to you tomorrow"" routine but engineer needing the change said he needs it now, and will just wait for Tony to do it while he watched. Tony fumbled for a while, couldn't even figure out how to open the file, obviously pretended to take a phone call, then just left for the day.

After investigating a bit, we found out Tony didnt have any of the experience he'd claimed, just took the portfolio work from former engineer colleagues and passed it off as his own. Best part, he had convinced a local college student that he had an unpaid internship and Tony would have this kid do his work after hours and bring it in the next day.  Despite the admiration for Tony's ability to run  several simultaneous con jobs involving several people, we felt it appropriate to let him go.

About two years later, we're hiring for another similar position and Tony's resume shows up on my desk. This time he lists 2 years of ""Principal Engineer"" experience at my company (where he is still employed) with super embellished job duties and fully made-up accomplishments.

Apparently Tony was looking for work again and had sent his resume to one of the recruiters we work with not knowing he was applying to the same company from which he'd been fired 2 years earlier and was falsely claiming as his current employer.

Like if you’ve had a death in the family or some devastating family emergency, just call in. Don’t worry and stress about covering your shift, I’ll figure all of that out, just take care of your family. This wretched girl that was hired a month before I took over management had 2 family deaths in one month. At first I was very supportive and told her she could take all of the time she needed to handle family affairs and her job would still be waiting for her. After the 2nd death, one of the other servers pulled me aside and showed me 2 posts on her finsta of her out fishing on a boat that were made when she was supposedly at the funeral of a 10 year old cousin that had died of fucking brain cancer. She told me about all of the snapchats she was getting from wretched girl getting her nails done and partying at the bar with friends when she was supposedly at her aunts funeral in another state after her aunt had killed her self. I mean, these deaths she made up were elaborate and detailed. When I started that job there were a lot of call ins because the previous manager never enforced any rules or punishments so I was cracking down on call ins and writing people up with a “3 strike” policy. This chick was already on her 2nd strike so she thought she would take advantage of my family first policy after no one would agree to pick up her shifts so she could party and go out on the boat. I found her mom on Facebook and messaged her my condolences just so I could get confirmation of the lies. Mom said there hadn’t been a death in their family in years and that her sister and her 10 year old nephew were both alive and healthy. So I got to fire her and she got in trouble with her mom. "

A lot of men don’t realise the impact that such a small change in their tone can have on women, especially smaller women who don’t have as much weight to throw around. (I’m pretty tall and heavy, so experience this slightly less, but it’s still there.)

We don’t want to be afraid, and most of the time we’re too embarrassed or even ashamed to admit it, because it’s hard being a guy around women with the recent headlines and media, and we don’t want the guy to feel like we’re accusing him of anything (if nothing else, making him feel like this will result in him getting defensive and result in more voice raising).

After this, I'd vowed never to date someone who I didn't think I could spend the rest of my life with. So things were looking pretty bleak for me on that front. Then one day in college (UK college, so think 15-16) I was walking out to get some food and I passed someone who I later described to my friend as ""the cutest girl I've ever seen"". She was basically the living embodiment of ""my type"". I've never seen someone so attractive that I've done a double take on them as I passed them.  
  
So after this I basically decided I was never going to see her again, such is life etc etc. It was nearing the end of my last year in college and at the time I had planned to move down to London (The other side of the country from me) for a job, so I basically had no hope. Then I saw her again, I was hanging out with my friends before class and she walked past. I wanted to say something but I had class and my friends were all watching, she'd actually become quite a hot topic inside the group, everyone knew of her and called her ""christmas jumper girl"" because that's what she was always wearing. I kept telling myself next time I'd talk to her, but I never did.  
  
One day around mid December, I got out of class early and I was alone. I went to go and get  drink from the vending machine and she was there, sat on her own in the cantine. So I walked back around and went and effectively hid from her whilst I decided what I was going to do. Then one of my friends saw me and asked me what was up, so I explained the situation and they encouraged me to go and talk to her.   
  
My original plan was to go over, tell her she was cute just to get it off my chest and then leave again. Obviously it didn't go like that, I told her I liked her jumper (also true, and probably a safer opener) and then I asked if I could sit with her. We spoke for the rest of the period, and right before I left I asked for her snapchat username, it was the quickest thing I could think of.   
  
We started a snapchat streak that day (yeah I know, dumb Gen ~~X~~ Z crap, but it has significance to us, okay!?) and we started dating about 2 months later. This was almost 2 years ago, and we're still very much together. "
16494,"Certainly more ethical, though, and unlike ""natural"" diamonds, the artificial ones are nearly flawless. But thanks to advertising, diamond companies have convinced us that the flaws make them *special.*

""You see, the shitty one here is natural so you have to pay more for this one instead of the flawless one which looks twice as good and half the price.""

""But how can I look her in the eyes giving her a diamond ring while knowing not even one slave died mining it?"""
16495,"I looked up my childhood home a few years ago and was surprised at how small it is. My parents raised four kids in that little house. For many years the house only had two bedrooms and then my dad built in the car porch and made it a bedroom. Even when I look at the front yard of the house it's small and I never realized it.

My mom and sister drove down to south Florida one time I think to visit a childhood friend of my sister. My sister asked the owners of our old house if she could get a photo of it and the owner took a pic of my sister and mom standing in front of the house. I have never returned to south Florida since the day I left there at age 15. I am now 64. 

My adult son was on a trip and decided to look for my grandparent's house in rural Alabama. I couldn't remember the address as my grandparent's passed away a long time ago. My son had to call my uncle and he actually gave my son the wrong directions. My son finally found the old house and took some photos. There was a married couple living in the house but they hadn't done anything to improve the house which is a shame. My son saw a man working on his truck in the yard so my son walked up, introduced himself and told the man that his great grandparents used to own the house. My son also told the guy that my grandfather had shot himself in the house. We don't know if was suicide or accidental. The couple told my son that they knew of the death and I guess it's because they know the people who live in the house across the dirt road from them. The odd part is that the couple told my son that my grandparents were still in the house. They said that every Spring they hear the dishes rattle in the cabinet and in the dish drainer. My grandfather died in the Spring but my grandmother died in a nursing home. My son and I agreed that what the rattling the couple were hearing was probably mice. The house is surrounded by woods and of course it's old so it's probably rodents roaming around. "

16500,"My uncle has to wear a specially modified butt plug so he doesn't shit himself. Years of anal abuse with various phallic fruits and vegetables, as well as various power tools has rendered his asshole into a sagging, prolapsed disaster. Turds would just fall out of him. One time a random butternut squash just dropped out of his shorts. It was caked in loose excrement.  

This is when we had to find someone to model a butt plug for him. They took a mould of his wretched, gaping rectum and hand crafted an enormous plug to contain his near constant, spontaneous  bowel evacuations.  

When he gets home, my aunt makes him remove it in the garden so she can hose down the deluge that gushes out of his behind. This was caused by an incident of him removing the plug inside and inadvertently murdering my aunt's Chihuahua.

He sexually assaulted me 3-4 times a week for 4/5 months before I managed to stop it. I'm really ashamed of that and I don't tell a lot of people about it, so it's hard for me to even type here. I was able to distance myself from him but stayed in the relationship for another 5 months, as time went on he became more and more manipulative, controlling, etc. 

I went to a party with a friend once and he said the only reason he ""let"" me was because he told that friend to ""babysit me"" so I didn't do anything I'd ""regret"". luckily my friend told me that as soon as it was asked of him and said that he would 't be babysitting me for my then bf. if I went out I had to text him as often as I could, if I went an hour or so without texting him he would text my mom to find out where I was and what I was doing. We were 19. As a textbook abuser he isolated me from all my friends and family, and I let it happen. I was lucky enough to have friends who were understanding and helped me out when I reached out for help to let them know what was going on. 

After we broke up, he would constantly text my mom, myself, and any of my friends who hadn't blocked him already. He would send people he knew to places he knew I'd be to ""report"" on what I was doing. I was friends with my current bf while I was dating my ex, and so my ex spread rumors that I cheated on him with my current bf. (I didn't lmao) My ex even tried to befriend my current bfs friends to try and get invited to the same parties as me, or any kind of social event tbh. After I had blocked any way for him to contact me or anyone I knew he showed up at my house, with a big box of everything I had ever given him and a handwritten letter asking me to take him back. I gave away anything worth something and threw out the rest. A month later he asked for it all back. "

It's in a case that makes it look almost like a dildo. So they take one look at it and start questioning my wife about what this is.

I basically wanted a short choppy razor cut.

This idiot gave me a bizarre bob/bowl haircut with the underside shorter than the top layer, then proceeded to blowdry the shit out of it with a round brush and drench me in hairspray so I had a giant bubble on my head, like the helmets from Spaceballs.

The depression is like being sucked into a black hole of rawness. People don't often explain how painful depression is. The raw pain inside like your heart is beating against your chest, your stomach bubbling with nausea and acid because you are not eating properly. The heavy feeling in your head, chest, and limbs.

The only option is to sit there and cry or go to bed and ride it out like a fever. You are completely devoid of all emotions other than sadness and suffering. The depression fog that grows is so thick and murky. The fog can't be easily parted.



Once the fog takes over the brain, you will begin to make irrational decisions or feel irrational things. Your thought process is dulled and jumbled up. The more you think about the future the more you can't see a way out or a solution so you decide that  dying would be the best option.

I ride my depression out like a fever. I do this because I know when I have a relapse of depression and I have it very strong, I tend to make decisions I wouldn't normally make or say thing that are not usual thing I say. I feel and act like a different person. The depression is like as if you are being possessed. You feel like a totally separate being. The reality of it is that depression is so very hard to understand.

Others have mentioned Luna Lovegood as a possible lifemate for Harry, and I agree that would've been good: she was interested in his celebrity status but not overwhelmed by it, she proved she could keep her head in a dangerous situation. And both she and Harry saw the Thestrals.

Another possibility would be Harry and somebody from Hufflepuff, partly because that house was so obscure in the series, partly because I'd like to see if Rowling could bring it off. Who knows, after his tumultuous life The Boy Who Lived might long for somebody stable, down-to-earth, and loving."

I'm thinking ""What the fuck?"" in my head and feeling sorry for the poor baby, but I stood there until she came back, she thanked me, and walked away with the baby and some pizza.

16729,"Worked for a hospital that was going through a ""culture"" change. They brought in a management group to help them get in better financial shape and what was their first recommendation? Cut nursing staff and pay. Within 90 days we lost 10% of our nurses. We were struggling to legally and safely take care of patients. 

Meanwhile, the management team and the senior management went on a 2 week trip to the Caribbean all paid for by the hospital. Flights, food, rooms, alcohol....all of it. I came into work that next morning after discovering that and saw an email saying the 4 nursing jobs I needed filled were denied due to budget costs. 

I pride myself in being levelheaded and rational when I'm angry or frustrated, but that was enough. I know that cutting some of their benefits wasn't going to save the hospital, but you lead by example. I never opened the email (as the info was in the subject line) and I called the local newspaper about 5 minutes later. I set up an interview with a journalist and told him to bring a big notebook. 

I resigned after making sure that my staff had their vacations approved and their bonuses (if any) were locked in to be paid. I did everything possible to help my unit out and then I just sort of left. I left the key to my office with my resignation letter in HR. They called and offered to keep me and I told them it would cost 4 new nurses. I never heard back. Spoke with the reporter 2 or 3 times after that and told them everything. I told them exactly what the community was paying for on a daily basis. He dropped a small story that eventually grabbed some serious attention. I know from some former employees that a lot of people were forced out over that. A few had to stand in court for minor monetary charges and 1 was charged with embezzlement. 

They were in serious trouble after that and eventually a bigger entity bought them up. Supposedly things are doing much better now and those that rode it out went through some serious hard times. I don't know how or why they stayed. The funny part was that new culture program was never implemented. They paid a ton of money for it and never even opened the box. "

16788,I would never refuse to change my opinion on anything. All of my opinions are changeable based on the strength of any new arguments/evidence I come across.
16789,"I was an undergrad in the early 1980s, and one of my school's most famous professors, Dr. Bass, who started the ""Body Farm"" at UT Knoxville, actually taught his freshmen classes himself, which was unusual even then. Since he was already well-known, he was invited to attend some function where he'd get to meet President Reagan, and he declined, because he had a class of freshmen to teach at that time. I decided at that time I would follow him into battle should such a scenario materialize. "
16790,Yup. They had code words for a lot of stuff but that was by far the most degrading 
16791,That and they only lived together for like a day before he shot that bird and she moved out.
16792,"Got this off an ifunny top comment, but people always get a kick out of it. 

So Obama and his wife are about to go to a Halloween party, and they don't know what to be. Obama straps his wife to his back. At the party, someone asks ""what are you supposed to be?"" Obama says ""a turtle"" the guy asks ""well what's that on your back?"" Obama says ""Michelle"" "
16793,"Exact same situation happened with me. After I got my shit together enough to ask for help life is much much better. Terrible thing is that recently my wife's good friend was going through the same thing with her husband and it was odd watching it happen. Being an observer from the outside made me realize how shitty my wife's life was having to deal with me. Sadly the other guy refused to acknowledge he had a problem and get help so the marriage fell apart.

Please, folks, if you think you might need help just go talk to a doctor. I was scared to have that talk but not only did I get diagnosed and medicated properly it really felt good just to talk to someone without worry of being judged or misunderstood."
16794,What's the difference between an oral and rectal thermometer? The taste.
16795,Have a goal.  Don't just go to college because you think that you have to go.
16796,Back when I started in the emergency services there was a picture going around of a lifesize replica a nurse made out of ED equipment after a rookie was sent to her to find some.
16797,"Basically anywhere they could get the big trucks away from the main road. One was a gravel lot near a park, another was the dead end of a road that had closed years before. I don't remember any others since this was about 10 years ago."
16798,Yeah but they think oh that’s weird and then watch other stuff. My girlfriends definition of kinky is doggy style without a condom. 
16799,I haaate helping people look for lost things
16800,I make sure to compliment my BF whenever I can. Not only do I love making him smile but he deserves to feel like a prince just as much as he makes me feel like a princess 
16801,"This is one of the most horse shit replies to this question. I have several, good looking, female friends and I'd never sleep with them, even if they were single and even if given thew opportunity. Not all guys are lead by their cocks. "
16802,"My son asked me why I pee at he shorter urinal. I told him I didn't want to get sprinkled with tinkle. He then proceeded to pull his shorts down and plop his marbles on the rim of the tall urinal. Like, yeah, I didn't want that either. "
16803,I once peed and it started as a double stream and then quicker than I could process it went to triple and then one started moving a bit. I’m not sure how but I got pee on my hand when that happened
16804,*(Joe Breezy vomits straight up in the air)*
16805,Amen.
16806,Our penises retract and grow to any length we want. If he has a small dick it’s because he isn’t attracted to you. 
16807,That a 6 sided dice will roll a 3 or 4 far more often than a rare 1 or 6.
16808,Eh I had the opposite experience. It confirmed for me how other adults forgot their teens and mistakenly treat them like elementary school aged children. 
16809,"""If you are willing to look at a park visitor's pick-a-nick basket as a reflection of the state of their relationship with themselves rather than a statement about your intelligence, in relation to the average bear, then you will, over a period of time, cease to react at all.""

16816,"Don't you mean Podcaster, video game streamer, and occasional YouTube creator?"
16817,You've clearly never gotten to sit back and quietly watch someone you dislike fuck up while knowing you could have prevented it.   Active forms of revenge my not be that useful but cutting someone out of your life and refusing to intervene in their reciprocating train-wreck of an existence is great.

16820,"I was stabbed with one of those little screwdrivers. 

I was jumped and they got me on the ground. Next thing I know, I see this guy moving in a stabbing motion with something in his hand. I put my arm in defense. It hurt initially but not like what you’d think. I was mostly freaked out because it didn’t penetrate all the way through. It was only long enough for the skin to be standing up on the top of my forearm. Hurt much more later. I think the fear of the moment was worse than anything else."
16821,How long were you apart? And what changed if you don't mind me asking?
16822,"I once literally threw a book she wrote across the room because I was so annoyed with it. It wasn't that story- it was about child abuse and parents trying to take justice into their own hands. But it was just so overblown and ridiculous, I couldn't take it. Something like child abuse shouldn't be written about like that much of a clown car nightmare. "
16823,"I had several bad blood vessel pops on my eyeballs after laser eye surgery. My eyes were almost half red, half white. It lessened significantly within a week or two and went away completely after about a month. If yours haven’t gone away after years, you should really go see your eye doctor. I know it’ll probably put you out a hundred bucks but it’s worth it. For all you know there might be a simple prescription fix, or they might not be popped blood vessels at all but something else. "
16824,"I would pause time as the teacher is walking for our assignments, quickly finish mine. Than proceed to walk over to the nearest gas station, steal from the register, and do whatever the hell else for the rest of a paused day "

Her response?  
""Okay, that makes sense."""
16828,"This. Spill the whole plot. You might go to jail and even get executed. You will save 3000 lives just in the next day, to to mention prevent all the other crap that has happened since. It’s not a tough choice. "

16835,"Constantly walking everywhere with my head down. It's not that I thought it was normal - I just didn't think about it at all.

One day somebody asked me if I was sad and when I asked why they said ""because of the way you were walking, staring at the ground like that"".

I try to look up more now, but it's such an long-standing habit that I still don't think about it much."
16836,"I was on a 2 month bicycle trip from Norway to Portugal. She was my Couchsurfing host in a Czech village. I pushed back my packed itinerary to stay an extra night with her, and she flew to Lisbon to meet me at the end of the 7600km trip. We are engaged now and moving in together in 3 weeks."
16837,"Dont worry, it's only a sex thing"
16838,"It will hurt her though. You are not fully invested into he relationship, because you are also invested in someone else. She is giving you much more than you are giving her, a relationship like that will not last."

16854,"I'm not an Urban Explorer, but me and a group of friends shot a YouTube video in an abandoned warehouse a few years back.
We decided to scout around and look for some rooms to do the video in, there was some cool stuff around, like old abandoned double decker buses that we had fun dicking around in. After shooting for a bit, me and two of my friends decided to go upstairs because there was a room with a window that looked cool for the video.

We enter that room, broken glass everywhere and it fucking stunk. I see a cute little kitty fast asleep next to some newspapers, so we walk over to it, trying not to step on glass

The cat isnt asleep, it's fucking dead, half of it's face is gone and it's skull exposed, but it isnt rotting, everywhere but the face is fine. The newspapers? A collection of page 3 girls, all over the table where this cat was, dated the same week we were there.

When you're 14 years old, and you see a dead, almost faceless cat surrounded by topless women, you freak out. For some reason, we still decided to shoot in that room, not sure if you can see the cat in the video, will edit if I can get it."

16856,"I worked in a top end restaurant for a long time - 4 Diamond award year after year and great reviews, never had a poor inspection, and some of the best food I've ever had came from our kitchen there.

Carpet floors.

Keeps the sound muted and low, a quick spilled drink won't cause a huge slick spot we have to put a garish yellow sign next to and mop up, darker color means less stains over time from just general traffic. 

We vacuumed the entire floor twice a day - before we opened and before we set the tables - and then after we closed and got the linens to the bin. 

It was professionally steam cleaned and shampooed once every month or so as well as a matter of course - even if it didn't need it. "

16865,"Regional company in the PNW called Bi-Mart, sort of a small scale Wal Mart they are supported mostly by baby boomers. "
16866,"I was so out of my mind after my baby was born. Combination of being a new mom, no sleep, difficult recovery from csection (my qball wasn’t working at all. Like backed up with blood into the line. And no one realized it until a day later, when I was in too much pain to walk. Have digestive issues, allergic to Percocet, and was breastfeeding. It was an actual garbage fire). My son was unexpectedly in the nicu and I didn’t want to leave him even to pee for fear I’d miss my chances to nurse him. And I was off my narcolepsy meds (because breastfeeding), not sleeping (because 5 days in the hospital and constantly getting vitals so no sleep), and the pain medicine was either too strong or not working at all. Add in a touch of PPD and a splash of retained placenta, and you have me lol. 

I FORGOT HOW TO TELL TIME. No motherfucking joke. I would stare at the clock and try to remember how to read it and I just couldn’t do it. One of the weirdest feelings of my life and lasted until I actually was out of the hospital. They would ask how long I had nursed on each side and I just couldn’t tell them. I couldn’t read numbers at all, and definitely not an analog clock. Never want to experience that feeling again. All of this to say, I completely get where that lady was coming from. "

In school we had days off for hunting (this is how most people got their meat for the year) and then the following days/week we had processing and making sausage.  People who hit deer with their cars would donate the deer to the old folk's or children's home so they could have meat. We processed it in school for free for them as class projects.

16900,"""Mother Simpson"" from Season 7 of The Simpsons.

Homer grew up under the impression that his mother was deceased when in reality she had to flee from the law when Homer was very little for what she did fighting the nuclear plant as an activist. She is very much an idealist and has very strong feelings regarding right and wrong. More importantly, Mona (Homer's mother) as a character explains where Lisa gets her disposition, Mona Lisa. 

Homer is elated to discover his mother is alive, and Lisa being Lisa, is suspicious that Mona isn't who she says she is based on the fact that she does not carry solid identification and tends to act anxious around the police. Lisa confronts her about it and Mona comes clean about her past and why she chose to leave Homer and Abe. 

The episode ends with Mr. Burns realizing who she is and coming after her once again for her past crimes. Homer helps her flee and drives her out of town to meet up with her hippie/activist friends. Mona is heartbroken to have to leave Homer all over again, but this time Homer is more comforted by the fact that he does indeed have a mother and that she loves him. As the credits roll, Homer sits on the hood of his car gazing out to a star-filled sky letting this new aspect of his life sink in.

16904,"Careful. One of the absolute *best* classes I've ever taken was taught in this manner. On the very first day this particular professor got up, talked a *ton* of shit on having to make a syllabus, warned us that he was going to stray, and that if we thought that a lack of structure wouldn't be good for us that we should leave.

That made me a little nervous to be honest, but as it turned out the guy was a certifiably fucking brilliant orator with a complete library of information in his head. *Nobody* had to take notes in that class because his lectures were so engaging &amp; vivid that you had no choice but to capture the points he was making. Attendance was always nearly 100%. 

That guy was born to lecture. "

He was in his wheel chair minding his business when a pizza delivery guy showed up to bring some pizza to staff. The old guy asked if that was the same pizzareia as the one he remembered from his young days and if the guy could leave him a business card. The delivery guy didnt have one and left the old man kind of disappointed.  So I looked it up on my phone and wrote the address of the home and the phone number of the pizza place for him on a sheet of paper and gave it to him. Little things like that bring me some happiness in life.

We got another cat and she gained weight again and looked healthy and her fur was shiny. The new cat died from pneumonia a year later and it was nearly the same deal again. She immediately quit eating and started losing hair.

Got another cat and she's doing just fine again.

16959,"It's mainly because some wisdom teeth extractions require more cutting of soft tissue and bone removal than others. This is due to many reasons mainly being the position of the tooth in the mandible, its angle and impaction and also to a lesser extent the clinicians technique/skill.

If I put my patients through a quite difficult extraction I will always prescribe a bit of codeine because bone removal will cause inflammation and pain in recovery. Some wisdom teeth exos are simple and you tell the patient if they really need just take some otc paracetamol. Also different people have different healing rates (e.g diabetics)and thresholds for pain.

Btw dont take ibuprofen post extraction since it's an anti inflammatory. Paracetamol is much better since you want inflammation for the clot to form and wound healing"

17008,"Help people with a legitimate need.  Donate cash (not canned goods) to your local food bank.  They are able to buy far more food, and nutritious stuff too, than you can with that same amount of money, because they buy in bulk and buy foods that stores have trouble moving.  It's not even stuff that's going bad, just what there's too much of.

And then once you donate there, every time you pass by a beggar, ignore them or tell them no you don't have any cash.  And do so with a clear conscience.

Giving money to beggars only encourages more begging.  The more money beggars get by begging, the harder it is for them to justify finding an alternative way to support themselves.  Your money goes much further and creates a more positive social change by supporting the institutions that can provide real help.  Think about the single parents too busy trying to care for children to go out in the street to beg.  Think about the people desperately looking for work.  Just because you don't see them right in front of you don't make them less deserving of a good meal--that's what the food bank is for."

An old friend of mine told me she'd be my DD one night while I was out with my (now) fiance and other friend (who'd never met her).  She wasn't at the bar with us, so we didn't see her before she picked us up.  After being in the car with her for 10 minutes, I quickly realized she was also intoxicated.  Mind you, I'd had 4 shots that night because I was celebrating my fiance getting into med school.... I had to calmly backseat drive her to my house and get everyone home safely. It was one of the scariest nights of my life. She t-boned another driver in the process, pulled a hit and run, and then drove to my house.  I told her to stay there and sleep it off, and we'd take action the next morning.  She left in the middle of the night, had her car fixed in cash, and went along like it was nobody's business.  At that point, there was nothing I could do since i was drunk in the backseat.  Needless to say, we are no longer friends. "

17054,"Unfortunately I don't have anything else quite at quite the same level of strange and fun, but here are some things that have happened to me on or near trains:
-The first time I took a train I was like 19 and looked about 12, and these two women saw me hanging out on the platform and decided to become my Official Train Guardians so that I didn't get lost and end up in the wrong state or something. During our layover (is it still a layover if you're switching trains?) they passed the time by stopping and asking everyone who was hanging out and looking bored in the waiting area what they thought of Kate Middleton while I followed them around like a sad lost lamb with a too-big backpack.
-Once I ended up being seated next to a girl who had actually gotten on the train with a previously used ticket and nobody noticed until we had been traveling for almost an hour, and when they did she told the most amazingly fake story about how she was planning on leaving her fiancé for Justin Timberlake and needed to make it to his concert so they could run away together. 
-I won't knit on the train anymore because one time I did and I had a pack of three little old ladies frickin' _descend_ upon me before I could even finish a row to tell me that my hand position was all wrong. They insisted on observing me to make sure I was doing it right and kept checking on me until their stop.
-A woman tried to convince me to investigate the death of her mother, which she was convinced was related to undetectable geophysical activity in the region in which she lived. 
-I played late-night cards with a guy who had apparently lived in my very small hometown at the same time I did, had attended college in the same city as me, and was on his way to visit a friend in the same very-small-and-not-really-on-the-train-route town to which I was traveling. He also had the same name and general physical features as a dude with whom I attended high school but just enough differences that it was kind of uncanny. My best guess to this day is that some parallel universe bumped into ours for a while.
-On the outbound train a week before The Night of Journey and Holiday Cheer I was reading Good Omens in the observation car and a dude came up, plunked himself down by me, and introduced himself as Indigo. He sort of chattered at me for a few minutes and I sort of nodded along, and then he asked me what my book was and I told him that it was a story about the apocalypse. The expression on his face turned from semi-generic chatting-a-girl-up-on-a-train pleasantness to absolute terror and he physically recoiled in his seat. ""I don't know how you can even look at that"", he said. ""That's some scary shit. And I know it's coming, and I look at you and I know you know it's coming too. Which side are you going to be on?"" And then he got up and walked away and I've been trying to forget about it ever since."

Ask for the callous remover with your pedicure, it’s an extra $10 to really scrub the dry skin off. It’s amazing.

He believed he'd created an absurd alternate pocket universe he could freely travel to as a perverse sort of vacation, and tinkered with circumstances to see what would happen if Trump was president, because he ""thought it was funny"".  His exact words, .  But he'd since become personally attached to this pet social experiment, its magnitude,  and was wondering if there was any way out of its plight.

Honestly this was most absurd client I've ever seen, crossing a line from pathological delusion into willful simple (mercifully rare, though not my first time) pranking of a therapist to stoke one's personal narcissism, which is just a waste of any professional's time.  

Then he offered to briefly ""bounce"" me temporarily into ""the prime universe"".  Seriously, those exact words.  I decided this would be best opportunity to challenge the delusions/lies by temporarily excusing our session to talk the Helen, our receptionist, who was very unsettled by my question of who was president.  Madame Clinton, of course.  I actually commandeered her PC and googled that shit in front of her and she looked at me like I was a madman.

I returned to our session, but really I don't remember much after that.  Existentially, I'm a mess.   I am looking for a professional therapist to help me navigate this"

17076,"&gt;In case you aren't familiar, ASD is much rarer in girls than in boys (or at least more difficult to phenotype and diagnose)

Can we talk about this for a moment? I've always believed that I have extremely high-functioning Asperger Syndrome (I went to an expert, was told I had alot of the traits, but he was reluctant to diagnose - a fact that I'm now very thankful for).

I have always been interested in the ""boys vs girls"" aspect of ASD. I seem to remember reading that alot of the girls develop a 'persona', and manage to go undetected. They practice social skills, and appear fairly normal in social situations, but sometimes slip up. Think of that slightly weird girl in school that is normal like 99% of the time, then makes a mistake and gets socially outcast for it, because whatever she does is totally outlandish.

As someone who works around the occasional high-functioning ASD person, does this sound plausible? I'd love to hear your opinion."

I was assistant manager at a movie theater and she worked in the concession area.  She had a rough home life and her parents had recently kicked her out of her house.  At the time, I shared an apartment with another assistant manager and projectionist from another theater.  The other assistant manager felt bad for her because she was hopping from couch to couch in order not to have to sleep on the streets, so he offered her to move in with us and sleep on our couch permanently (paying a portion of the rent, of course).

When she moved in, I felt bad that she had to sleep on the couch, so I offered her my bed and I chose to sleep on the couch instead.  We were both dating other people at the time, so we thought nothing else of it and she gladly accepted.  A few months passed and I had quit the theater to work as assistant manager of Electronics Boutique (more money, better hours).  It just so happened that around this time we had both recently become single and it was her 18th birthday.  Because she had recently dumped her loser boyfriend and didn't have a lot of money, she was just sitting around the house watching TV and having what I considered a miserable 18th birthay.

I decided that was a sucky way to spend it, so I told her to get up, I was taking her to get some food and at least have a decent birthday.  Without either of us knowing it, it became our first date and we have been together ever since.

That was 20 years ago."

17092,"I've told this story before so I'll just c/p my original comment:

This was an old boat, built in 1926, wood hull. At the time we had it set up for dragging sea scallops. Once in a while we would be out on an overnight trip, and you would be laying in your bunk in the middle of the night listening to the waves lapping against the bow, and all of a sudden you would hear a sharp knocking against the side of the wood hull from the outside. Sometimes from under the boat, sometimes higher up along the sides, but always where it would be at least a couple feet underwater. Sometimes just one or two sharp knocks, sometimes a flutter like the drumming of fingers on a desk, but very distinct and - dare I say - deliberate. And it would usually come in waves. Like it would happen multiple times over the course of a few minutes and then not again for the rest of the night.

It came up in conversation a few times with some of the other guys and there were all sorts of different theories. The guy who ran the boat before we did claimed it was actually sea scallops swimming up and bouncing off the bottom of the boat. He claimed that when a scallop bed became overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable, that some of them would swim up into the water column and drift along with the upper current to find new areas to populate, and the sound we heard was their shells hitting the boat as we drifted through a ""school"" of them. I have no idea if there's any science to back that up and it sounds pretty dubious to me, but it's not like I have a better explanation for it. I mean, besides mermaids..."

17099,"This reminds me of a story I read on reddit years ago, about a couple of brothers who were out driving in New Mexico. They were using Google Maps (or idk, maybe a real map) to navigate, and suddenly a town popped up where there shouldn't have been a town, according to the map. They stopped there, went into a diner, and the waitress started treating them like she knew them--knew their names, weird details about them, even said they had worked there (iirc) for a while. Eventually they left, and a while later determined to come back to find the town again, but never could.

The story stuck with me (it was told better in the original than I've told it here, of course), but I've never been able to find it again... Just like they could never find that town again??? (No lol, just that I'm terrible at finding old stories on reddit.)

17102,"I was wandering around New Mexico doing the solo tourist thing, and stopped at a town on US380 running along the northern edge of White Sands Missle Range. “Town” might be a bit of an exaggeration— there were all of maybe five buildings and not a soul in sight.  Still, this was the closest settlement to the Trinity Site, where they set off the first atomic bomb test back in ‘45, so I stopped and went into a building with a sign marking it as the general store to look for souvenirs for friends back home.

The building looked more like somebody’s private house than anything else, but it had a sign so in I went. Inside it looked more like a used bookstore or somebody’s disorganized library than a general store, but it had a counter with a bin of those “Atomic Fireball” cinnamon hard candies next to the register— just the thing to hand out back home from the birthplace of the atomic age, give or take about 30 miles or so.  I grabbed some and waited for someone’s to appear. And waited. I called out a few times, and then started noticing the subjects of the books on the shelves around me. They were all various conspiracy related titles— about the new world order, the Bilderberg group, how Bill Clinton was a secret drug dealer and murderer, etc. I eventually just wanted out of there, but really didn’t want some possibly paranoid conspiracy theory enthusiast to come into the room just to see me leaving.  

Finally from the back into the room walks a large brown tabby cat, which hops up on the counter and stares at me for a good long time. At this point, I left the candies where they were and slipped out to find souvenirs in less unnerving places staffed by human beings."

Any economic benefit supposedly reaped by clearing out low-income people (which is itself a giant misunderstanding of very basic economics by the writers) is immediately undone by the destruction caused by even small arms and improvised explosives."

But all the clamping down and my not being able to earn the things I wanted caused me to sneak out and get in trouble that way.  Teens are stupid because of hormones, not necessarily because they don’t understand the consequences.

Senior year was ROUGH for my whole family.  Lots of screaming.  Police involvement.  All because there wasn’t an understanding of earning freedom.  I love my parents, and we have an awesome relationship in my adult years.  But wrenching control out of their hands when I was 17/18 was a goddamn nightmare for everyone.

I had no intentions of going through with it, I just wanted to be left alone dammit.

17249,Nosferatu is out of a silent  German film based on Dracula. The idea that he is the one turning the lights off and on is comical as he is terrifying but the characters don't see him as terrifying. They see him only as the answer to why the lights are being flicked off and on. The endearing 'Nosferatu!' They exclaim is akin to someone realising their pet did something silly and they've only just realised.

So it's me in the middle, and he and his brother have bandanas over their mouths and gang clothing (all red), both pointing a gun at me. The thing is he was so excited to give me it and when I asked what they were holding he said guns.. that kind of stuff was so normalized in his life he didn't even realize they were bad. Like, though he made he and his brother bloods, he did draw hearts all over their outfits.. I showed his older brother and he just looked sad.

Thinking back I also had a student that I was told was fucking nuts (he had been moved from one school to ours and in our district it is reaaaally hard to be expelled) and he drew this creepy picture with all sorts of weapons on it and wrote stuff like ""murder, die die die, kill them"" etc. Weird thing is he gave me that drawing.

And by that I mean unscrew the wand, wipe down with a sanitary solution, then soak parts in a milk pitcher full of disinfectant overnight. This is in addition to running the cleaning tablets through 1x a day...

That said, we had an awesome crew. Once I and eventually the best supervisor there wandered off to a tech company, a manager/crew who I really love but who practically gave me a panic attack with how bad they were at cleaning policy moved into our store. 

I don't really order much from there any more :(

That said, if I had to answer the original question for sbux, I would say the fruit cup or any pastry that's even a little hard.

Looking back, I realize ""We love weird guys"" was a pretty wholesome place, actually.

I was deep in my ""post-modern, nihilist"" phase and, after spending some time spamming the forum with dumb threads about how everything was pointless or whatever, I just... changed the name to something \*very\* deep and stuff: ""We Aren't"".

It’s crazy really and I’m in such awe of them and what they’ve survived, and today they are successful, happy, well-rounded people. My dad lost his brother, and even when he speaks about him it’s the happy memories that get mentioned. 

I do see like a shadow fall over my dad’s eyes sometimes, when he tells stories, and I know it’s something he just can’t talk about. I can imagine your brother’s wife went through/saw some awful things as well... but humans are so incredibly amazing at surviving. "

After the cookies were gone, he stands right in front of me, looks me straight in the eye with this lonely look on his face and says ""Can I have a hug?"" I remember worrying about getting dirty or smelling bad at the time, but that's such a small price to pay to give someone lonely a moment of love.

Microsoft really fucked up by not including HD-DVD and also not marketing it .Most people didn't even know it was a thing.

The real victory was in the fact that Blu-ray was just as cheap to make, and had far higher storage capacity than HD-DVD, enabling porn makers to fit more, higher quality content on each disc for the same production price, The difference in quality and quantity enticed buyers to the platform. Standard movie production saw that porn's implemenation proved the use-concept and followed suit. It wasn't long after until HD-DVD was done."

Halfway across the field, I see a large shape coming towards me.  It was a horse, and it wasn’t happy to see me.  It had friends.  They started to gallop in a circle around me.  I tried to keep moving in the direction of the other fence and the horses kept up with me, getting more agitated.  Finally there was a break/gap in the circle and so I ran as fast as I could, making it out of the angry horse circle and to the fence.

17455,"I used to work in a national lab and some of the younger women would be dressed unwittingly very inappropriately.

As scientists, the general look is pretty casual - no need for suits, jackets, or pencil skirts and blouses. The funny thing is that, overall, among the older scientists and other workers, the women generally looked more professional than the men. But of the younger people in the lab (&lt;25, say), the women would come in wearing things that were quite unprofessional looking. It was not unusual to have most of the younger women wearing a sort of uniform of a clingy, spaghetti-strapped tank tops (short enough that it showed their bare back when the leaned over to do anything, or their midriff if they reached up), plus very short skirts or shorts - and I mean really short shorts, like shorter than ""boy short"" underwear. 

Now, these outfits looked great, and it was a hot part of the country so I understand why they were wearing it. I would also wear something similar on the way to work a lot of the time. But when I got to work, I added a pair of leggings and a shirt or light sweater over my tank top. I really didn't know what to tell them, but I definitely gave a bit of a bad impression - like they didn't care to present themselves seriously. Science can kind of conservative in a way and dressing like for work in what your bosses likely wouldn't even wear as underwear doesn't always send a good message. (This also goes for men in tank tops and short, loose shorts, but I never saw them wearing that to work.)

We got a room for the night from an elderly man at the counter in his pajamas.

Something seemed really off about the parking lot, but the room was very clean and quiet.  I was too tired to care about much else.

In the morning we were getting ready to go when I realized every other car in the lot had four flat tires and looked like it was at least 30 years old with an updated paint job.  Grass was growing out of the engine of one.  It was 6 a.m., and we were the only customers at that hotel or either of the two across the street.

The owner had placed decoy cars from the junkyard in the lot and turned on lights to make it look like people stayed there.  I guess it worked, since we felt safe enough to stop, but it was more sad than creepy at that point."

I was also really busy prior to this phone call, so wasn't fully focused, because I was thinking about finishing up the phone call quickly and getting back to all the things I had to do.

17498,"[Excerpt from Asimov's *The Rest Of The Robots*.](https://imgur.com/a/NORJm)

Just play the movie *I, Robot* and start the generator.

To expand:

His books are a completely rational take on how society might develop robots. Since society would never accept them unless they were utterly (and I mean utterly - see how self-driving car tech can be derailed by just a single crash) obedient and harmless to humans, that's how they were to be made.

In one of the books he specifically writes that the three laws are so deeply ingrained in the construction of the robot that it would all but destroy it trying to remove them. In contrast to the film where some robots are simply made not to obey them. 

The whole point of the books was to explore the problems that would occur with mainstream adoption of robots, not for a cheesy action flick.

You can draw some parallels to self-driving cars, we already ask problems about morality, if the cars should swerve to avoid danger (the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)), what might happen if a car is tricked, damaged, modified or fooled, and what people might do to avoid liability in the case of an incident that is their fault.

Edit 2:

I didn't actually give any examples from the book, so here's a couple off the top of my head.

- What happens if you tell a robot to get something (robots must obey) but you don't tell it the urgency? If you ask it to make you a cup of tea but there is no tea in the kitchen, will it plod along to the shops to get some or will it race there at 900mph charging through traffic? What happens if instead of tea you were asking it to refill the oxygen tanks... It's critical but not urgent. There is a story along these lines and how it conflicts with the robot's self-preservation.

Well similar, I was 12 years old in France for a holiday and my mum told me to go for a walk with this family friend before lunch (13, also female). We went for a walk to the forest and came across a very large treehouse. With different rooms spread across 5 or 6 trees, we climbed one of ladders and looked in and saw things to show that people were living there. Blankets, cans of food, clothes etc. This freaked us out and we ran back to where we were staying, and there was a full blown search party of 20-30 people looking for us.

17548,"Man I've thought about this so much.

Zombies need to reach a critical point for them to be truly dangerous. A single zombie is about the easiest thing to deal with (as long as we're dealing with slow zombies). It's numbers and their sheer tenacity that get you. They're like water. So let's assume that they have reached the critical point and you're dealing with a situation where 80% of the people around you have turned. 

If you're living in an urban area, you are pretty much just ticking down the moments until you die. You got at most days, if you can barricade yourself in with enough food and water. Imagine your commute, then imagine double that amount on the street, all trying to eat you. At any moment most people are inside their homes so you never really get a decent picture of just how many people are living around you. In a zombie apocalypse, you're going to see a lot of them on the streets as they make their own attempt at surviving. The more try, the more zombies and eventually the streets will be impassable for the horde on the streets. Check the number of people that live in your city per square mile/km for a good estimate of how many zombies are going to be getting in your way.

Even if that doesn't get you, the truly devastating part of the zombie apocalypse is how it destroys the functionality of society. Kiss infrastructure, trade, production and agriculture goodbye. There will be no one making sure the electrical grid stays up, making new goods, keeping zombies out of fields and moving goods between countries. Society used to work with urban areas being supplied with the area surrounding it. Large cities being supplied by even larger fields. Now all of that food is moved great distances even continents away. That's all gone now. So you got to go back to the roots and supply yourself off the land. Good luck doing that when the animal population has to deal with zombies as well and any farmland needs to be encircled by walls or you'll get virulent zombies walking on your food. Fishing seems to be the best bet.

Don't think you're going all ninja on the zombies either. Causing substantial brain damage is actually pretty hard. If you've ever hit something that's free standing you'll know that you can't get decent power on it as it bounces away. Cutting their heads off as if they're nothing is also pretty stupid. Executioners would often require more than one blow to cut someone's head off and that was with as favorable conditions as you could get. Cars aren't as invulnerable as some think either. If you hit a zombie at a decent speed, you're going to total it. Multiple zombies at low speed will probably dent it pretty bad as well. Driving really slowly and just calmly knocking them over is your best bet (it's hard to break car windows so they're not going to get in very easily), but you run the risk of being swarmed as the zombies call each other and are drawn to the car noise.

If there is a zombie outbreak you need to follow certain guidelines:

* Research multiple defensible places in rural areas near you. You want a alternative for your alternative of your alternative.

* Realize it as soon as possible. The faster the better your chances.

* Withdraw as much currency as you possibly can and use it non-sparingly.

* Head straight for rural areas.

* Acquire weapons and threaten whoever gets in your way with them.

* Acquire as much non-perishable food and water as you can. Do not be afraid to bribe others for theirs.

* Do not pick up additional individuals unless you have to or they have experience in combat, construction or farming. Charity is for those that can afford to give it.

* Secure your base of operations. It shouldn't need much work and your fortifications should be extremely dependable.

* Secure all the food that you can from your surroundings.

* Place noisemakers at a very far distance from your base to lure zombies off it.

* Implement safe ways to kill zombies around your base.

Do that and you'll survive until you run out of food. Honestly your way of living is fucked and what's coming is a life of extreme strife. I have a plan for long-term survival (there's a strong fishing tradition where I live), but I don't plan on using it. If I survive long enough to run out of food, then I'm happy that I got that much additional time."

17681,"My sister got scammed by a variation on this that I think warrants explanation as it might save someone:

If you have an account with a bank and deposit a check under a certain amount they usually don't actually bother to see if it's a bad check or not unless it's written from the same bank.  An example would be if you get a check from a Chase account for $500 and deposit it at your Bank of America branch.  They just give you the money and a few days later it either clears or if it doesn't they have someone to come after for the difference...which is **you**.

Almost all check-cashing scams rely entirely on the fact that most people do not know this and almost everyone will cash a check at a bank they have an account with.

So the scam revolves around you cashing/depositing a bad check, then taking money out (minus your ""payment"") and transferring it to another party before anyone realizes the scam.  They'll often engineer the scam to happen on Fridays when possible but *demand* payment asap to beat the clock."

After we shopped around for some quotes he then said he could find us some “approved” labels and we could skip paying someone to test the equipment and he will just mark them as approved.

i got the kittens out and rehomed though!"
17709,Fuck
17710,"TL;DR: Parents were REASONABLE Y2K preppers, I learned reasonableness from them.

My parents prepared for the Y2K thing. We stored up canned beans and had a manual pump for water as backup, and owned enough land to garden if need be. When I asked what the worry was, it was that computers weren't programmed to have calendars that went into the 2000's, and that there was a possibility the transportation infrastructure (dependant on computers) would crash on the turnover.

It ended up seeming pretty pointless... until I heard that it actually happened. 

...to the Microsoft Zune, some decade later or so. A whole bunch of them crashed out when they hit a certain date, and were apparently hard to reset. 

But having parents who were PRACTICAL preppers, and not PARANOID preppers instilled into me a drive for practical preparedness today. Me and my wife always have at minimum a month's worth of food on hand, between canned goods, and dehydrated meals and nutrition bricks in bug-out-bags and the truck. They've actually come in handy, and gives us confidence in rural New England where flooding or power outages CAN impact you greatly. So, mine was a case of Y2K prepping parents instilling a POSITIVE outlook on prepping."

A guy I was dating who was in Iraq for a good part of 10 years (pretty sure there are PTSD issues, and his ex cheated on him while he was there, on top of the war horrors he experienced) just pretty much started blowing me off-said he was trying to slow things down-and disappeared after telling me he was falling in love with me... It's been a few weeks with him relatively quickly just kind of disappearing and then I told him last weekend I need to step back and reset and evaluate because I'm confused... And not a word from him... I have no idea what to think other than even if this is a mental health issue and he really does love me, this isn't enough for me and I deserve so much more than just having him disappear... 

Edit: some more clarity... he said he was trying to slow things down and didn't realize that he was actually pushing me away. He told me ""I've heard about people getting these really strong feelings for someone so quickly but I've never experienced it. I can plan for all kinds of things, but not these feelings and not to protect myself from getting hurt."" I asked him what does he want me to do. He said ""give me just a little bit more patience."" Then he was sorta there for a week... Then a week ago Saturday we had plans to hang out and by 7 pm I messaged him asking if he still wanted to hang out (we'd messaged back and forth throughout the day but he was busy so I was just chilling being patient). I've not heard from him since. Because he's done that disappearing thing before, I messaged him Sunday saying I was going to step back. I also told him that I wasnt walking away, and that if he was to please let me know so I wouldn't bother him-the last thing I want is to be psycho or weird about it. "

17780,"I threw really horrible temper tantrums as a child. I was 8-9 years old throwing tantrums like a toddler would. My mom decided that “if you’re going to act like you’re 2, I’m going to treat you like you’re two.” 

She took away any toys/games that weren’t rated for ages 2 &amp; under, she swapped out my bed for a crib (I was tiny so I fit), I wasn’t allowed to cross the street to my grandparents without someone holding my hand, I wasn’t allowed to watch PG movies, only G rated movies. My bedtime was 7:30pm. 

It fuckin worked. I stopped throwing tantrums real quick. "
17781,"The Dreamcast controller is one of the best ever!

17787,"I don't know if this belongs here, but I've had reoccurring dreams of a town that doesn't exist.  I can tell you exactly how to get there, the layout of the town, and even places that I've lived in the town.  But, when I'm awake, the turn off from the local interstate that leads to the just isn't there, just a massive forest.  

The dreams sometimes seem to last months, days, or just a few hours.  For longer dreams I've had to get a job (I sometimes work in a bar downtown).  People I meet in the town question me about my whereabouts when I haven't dreamed about it for a while.  People have grown older over the years.  Gotten married.  Had kids.  A local ski lodge shut down, but they reopened it recently as a local history museum.

Over the last 5 years or so, the dreams are getting farther and farther apart.   I'm starting to forget things about the town.  Things that used to be clear I have to struggle to remember.  I assume one of these dreams soon will be my last visit to that weird little town."

Edit : True that everyone, the whole 'just didn't think of it' is pretty weak and doesn't hold up. Even so - it would be fun if they found a reason and moved forward with this knowledge now. Make for an interesting take. "

17823,"I called in to work the morning my dad died, and they told me to come in to take care of a client cutover that was scheduled that day and then afterwards I could go handle the arrangements. It shouldn't be a big deal because he's already dead. Meanwhile this cutover had been pushed back from the week prior because the owner of the company wanted to see the new Star Wars and took a bunch of managers with him. So obviously this cutover was super important. Mailed my badge back with some snapping turtle roadkill inside so it would show up on a friday afternoon knowing my manager wouldn't get to open it till Monday. If you're familiar with reptile and amphibian decomposition, they melt really quick unless they're out in the sun. Received a super angry call Monday morning about the smell filling the office. To which I replied, I don't see the big deal, the turtle was already dead.

I'd had a really bad cough for about three weeks that I'm pretty sure was bronchitis, and it finally progressed to full-fledged pneumonia. Employer had an insanely strict attendance policy, and I knew I wasn't going to be able to work the shift without collapsing. So I just didn't even bother going in. "
17827,"Ooooo lemme tell you all a story:

So when I was a senior in high school some acquaintances and I were hanging out in one of the dorm lounges (boarding school). I don’t know how it was brought up, but one guy said that he was like Houdini and could break out of anything. I like any stupid challenge, so I said, “I bet I could tie you up so you can’t get out!” And proceeded to tie his hands behind his back with the belt I was wearing. While trying to get out of it, he fell off the couch and started struggling on the floor. I stared at him for a few seconds before I figured out my jaw had dropped. It was at that moment I realized I wanted all my men tied up and writhing in the floor. "

17845,"In mid-november of 2006 I was sitting on the remains of my first stash of bootleg firecrackers. I had a few bottle rockets left and I absolutely **needed** to light them off - but never had the alone time at home to do so without getting busted by my parents.  


One day when my dad left to get groceries I decided I'd light one off. The neighbours would rat me out if they heard it - so lighting them off outside was no option. My adolescent hormone soup brain told me that I'd be safe if I lit just one bottle rocket off inside. So I wadded up about half a roll of paper towel and smushed the cheap explosive in the paper towel sandwich. I lit the fuse and expected the sweet rush of feeling that thing explode - without any of the disciplinary consequences.  


What I didn't realize was that paper towel is wildly flammable and I consequently created a a molten fireball of gunpowder and paper on my kitchen table. I ran to get the fire extinguisher, flooded my kitchen with the foamy mess, and started crying in fear of being caught.   


My dad came home to a smoky house, a smoldering bubble of laminate on the family table and his dumbass son covered in extinguisher fluid and shame."

17847,"I think it depends on context a bit. 

Before my mother quite smoking she was always saying how she wanted to quite and how I should never start etc.  She also was extremely honest about her previous drug use, and contextually explained that when she said xyz was a bad idea it was from this experience or that. Course she also didn't come down on me about anything she did and still enjoyed/thought was fine for her (like pot). I ended up not trying any such light substances until my 20s, and still refusing the harder stuff when offered by others.  That latter bit is probably more what your point is. I'm just trying to get at the idea that only putting forth rules you are a good example of might not be a great idea.

It would be like if peanuts suddenly became a taboo ingredient because some people have allergies. 

Otherwise it's a great ingredient that I use in almost every dish and it helps a lot. Highly recommended.

""*But how do I use it? It seems arcane and magical! I am not a wizard!""* Just pretend it's salt. sprinkle it on a dish like you would salt, use some salt too, mix, taste and use more if no noticeable improvement. For most large dishes, like a pasta or casserole or stir fry, a teaspoon or is usually enough.

Also, fish sauce. Available from Asian cooking sections or international food markets. It smells like death itself fermented and left in the sun to rot. But a teaspoon or so in most dishes instead of using pure salt adds a richness to the flavor that is extremely nice, especially pastas. "

17876,"Whole Foods distribution denied my partner his meager annual raise because he had to leave work early one day, one time because our house was flooding during the deadly Memorial Day flood in Austin. He left work ONE hour early, with his manager's permission, to help me try and save our stuff while the enitre city was flooding terribly. That same manager denied him his raise too. Can't have any strikes on your record for the whole year or you get denied the raise. He was the fastest picker in his warehouse too. He knew his rank because the bosses put a ranking of all the pickers up daily. That list also made all of the guys dicks to each other and no one helped one another out. The company also tenures the guys that have maxed out their raises, so those guys don't do shit and are not fireable. It's insane. He quit shortly after that evaluation and got a management position at another company almost immediately and has since rose to managing entire warehouses and shipping operations for a global company. He loves his job. Whole Foods may look good on a resume, but they're a terrible company to work for. I'm assuming things have only gotten worse since being acquired by Amazon.

EDIT: Also, just so y'all know, Whole Foods stocks and ships the exact same produce as every other big box store. They have the store employees stack the produce nicely and that's when the cost goes up. It's literally the exact same produce as a standard Walmart. I have a co-worker with not a lot of money that swears her ""food has flavor"" now that she shops at Whole Foods. I told her what my boyfriend's seen and she refused to believe me. My boyfriend can still point out specific cases of types of produce, usually when we're in a Kroger or Walmart, that he used to ship at Whole Foods.

Starting rate for a penciled page for the biggest companies is $125 - $150. For 12-16 hours per page that's about 10 dollars an hour for a craft you went into debt to learn, drawing characters that are recognizable around the world. 

And unless you're one of the handful of rock stars in the industry you're not even considered a meaningful member of the creative team. You're not allowed to interpret anything. You're just supposed to mindlessly execute the will of the writer.

Before Disney threw out all of their animators it was very siimilar for them. Near minimum wage for tirelessly making the thing that makes the company hundreds of millions of dollars.

This is why AI will take over creative industries sooner than people are willing to admit. Front line creatives are already treated like robots by the companies they work for. Corporations won't really have to make any changes to the workflow to make the switch.

17893,"Ladies it's pro tip time. If you want a guy to never ever ever forget you listen up.

If you want to give the perfect blow job, I suggest you check out Jenna Haze as she can provide some amazing tips. Here is a great POV video that we can use as an example. 

https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=1964046804

I know that it's porn but hang in there and we can learn from her... The tip of the penis is like a less sensitive version of the clit, so when she's giving head you will notice she strokes the shaft from top to bottom while sucking and licking the head. BIG WIN. 

Alternatively, when she is licking and kissing the shaft (do this your man will go fucking bananas) she is lightly rubbing the head with a rounding motion. This motion is key and is definitely worth practicing and focusing on as it is how most men jack off themselves.  Once you master a technique where you can comfortably transition between these two steps you will be on your way to sex goddess status. Throw in some eye contact (look up at him, you won't regret it) and tickle his stomach/groin area lightly with your nails and he will likely never forget you.

Super secret pro tip:

Find out what hand your man uses to jack off.  Based on that info you can figure out which side of the shaft/tip he favours. I use my left hand so when I jack off my grip feels best on the right side of my dick going up to the right side of the tip. Hope that helps!

3) if guy friend and I were actually meant to be together and just haven't yet, then you and I were never meant to be anyway.

Every bottle of shampoo you throw out. Every piece of merchandise packaged in plastic which you immediately throw out. Every cheap plastic toy you get at Walmart and is broken within a month.

17964,"""Don't judge me!"" guy.

This was about 2001 or so.  He was hired right after ""La migra"" showed up at our warehouse and it turned out we had a lot of people that didn't have ""accurate"" documentation. This is pre-ICE so it was just a friendly INS visit where they gave people an ample amount of time to run before doing an investigation. We had kind of a hiring spree to replace a lot of staff with only a few days of time.

He had a shaved head and was covered in tattoos.  Some of them clearly prison tattoos. Full sleeves, both legs, his whole neck and chin, as well as some on his cheeks.  He wouldn't stop saying ""Don't judge me!"" during the interview.  He freely said that he looks like a criminal but ""Don't judge me!""

We hired him and he was completely useless.  When you'd tell him to hurry up, he'd yell ""Don't judge me!"" He'd pack boxes wrong even though he was packing 300 boxes that were exactly the same. It was like he was just packing random things until the box was full.  When you'd say, please pay attention to the slip, he'd just go back to ""Don't judge me!""  You couldn't train him.  He was late every day. We stuck with him for about a month and a half because we chose to not judge him.

His mom called our office one day and said,
""My son has a bunch of expensive stuff in his room that have labels that say your companies name.  I know he can't afford them.  Did you give them to him?""

We said ""No"".  
She said, ""OK, I'll make sure you get the stuff back.""

He shows up to work the next day and our warehouse manager is waiting for him.  Our WM was planning on firing him outside and never letting him back in. 

The dude panics and runs around the outside of the entire building.  A big lap.  Our warehouse was in an area known as ""The Arboretum"" so it was solid woods backed up to the building.  It was rough ground and hard to run through.  He ran all the way around the warehouse and then hid in the trees in the back.  Our warehouse manager had to track him down in the woods, advise him that he was fired, assure him that we hadn't called the cops, escorted him get back to his car and let him go.

We never pre-judged him once and his mom returned all of his stolen goods the next day. 

""Don't judge me!""

&gt;[Pankration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankration) was a sporting event introduced into the Greek Olympic Games in 648 BC and was an empty-hand submission sport with scarcely any rules. The athletes used boxing and wrestling techniques, but also others, such as kicking and holds, locks and chokes on the ground. The only things not acceptable were biting and gouging out the opponent's eyes.

It's really dark and no street lights, but we pull off in this little town, go right to the hotel, get a room and all is well. The person at the front desk seemed alright.   


We get up the next morning and I look out the window and there's just all these ramshackle homes that don't look occupied all around this little motel. Garbage and shit piled up everywhere. Ok. Whatever. Just some odd folks. Nobody else was staying in the hotel. We were the only ones. The guy running the front desk in the morning was creepy.   


Okaaaay...so we get in the car and figure we'll hit McDonald's for breakfast. Every town has one, right? Not this one. Okay...so we'll hit that little grocery store up the street and just get some stuff. My wife says she'll go in and I stay in the car with the kids (two of them are really little in car seats so not worth pulling everyone out of the car). 2 minutes later she comes out quickly.   


""Drive. Get the fuck out of here now.""  


""What? Why?""  


""Just go. Just get the hell out of here.""  


""Okay""  


I spin the tires on the minivan and go. Once we are safely on the freeway she explains to me that the only people in the grocery store were these creepy old people that all wore the same kind of old school clothes. Not a huge deal...maybe a religious commune or something, but she said they all stared at her the entire time she was in there. She was going to get yogurt for the kids, but noticed that it was all expired. Then she was going to get those little boxes of chocolate milk. Those were expired as well. Not just by a few days, but by MONTHS. Then the people started walking towards her while she was looking at the other perishable stuff. Anything dairy was months expired. Bread on the shelves was moldy. She said it was like someone stocked the shelves 6 months ago and everything was just left there. The creepy old people were slowly shuffling towards her and that's when she came running out.   


She was really freaked out, and so was I once I heard about it, but I wanted to turn around and go back and check it out for myself.

I don't know what a better terminology would be, but generally, white privilege is meant to denote that there are many things that minorities (in general) have to deal with that a white person (in general) won't have to. 

People who argue that white people can't have problems are idiots, but there is truth in the idea that I won't ever have to worry about discrimination based on my white-ass name on a job-app.

It was Easter Sunday, and my parents had set up an Easter egg hunt in the house for my brother and I. The eggs were all over the house; and my parents had put 1$ coins in each of them. Even in their bedroom; our bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. My parents put us on a timer, and said anything we don’t get after 30 minutes they would take back.

My brother and I decided when the timer started, we would book it back to their bedroom because it was the furthest room from us, and we would work our way back. So my parents started the timer, and we ran up to their bedroom and into their bathroom.

We scoured the shower, under the sink, etc. then I shut the door, because there’s a shelf that’s hidden behind it with it open. There was an egg there, and we grabbed it; but the door locked behind us.

My brother and I immediately panicked and tried to open the door and bang on it and started yelling that our parents were cheating, and they had done it on purpose. We were just playing around, and it was all giggles and fun.

Then the room started shaking. 

I immediately got freaked out. I was only 8/9 at the time, my brother was 5/6. He was just kind of confused on why it was shaking. The blinds in the bathroom were shaking; and the window started flashing with really, really bright lights outside. I thought we were going to die. I started screaming and crying immediately and banging on the door for real now; and finally, after about ten seconds, my thoughts turned to keeping my brother safe. I opened up the cabinet door and started trying to shove him in there, because I remembered my teacher telling us about getting something to protect our heads if we had an earth quake. There was a REALLY loud noise outside; like a lot of wind and this really deep noise like something coming towards us. My brother was too big to get fully in the cabinet but I sat down against it to try and hold the door shut and I covered my head and closed my eyes and thought we were going to die.

Then the bathroom door opened, and all of it stopped. 

My mom was looking super confused at me when I opened my eyes. I immediately jumped on her and hugged her and cried and yelling that it was an earthquake because that’s the only explanation I had. My brother was stuck in the cabinet and she immediately freaked out and yelled for my dad, and he ran upstairs. My mom sat me on my bed and got my brother out, and he was crying and scared too. 

I told her what happened. She probably would have thought I was nuts, but my brother confirmed the lights, the shaking, and the scary ass noise. She and my dad had absolutely no explanation on this; and she said they didn’t hear us or any noise. They only came upstairs because there was like 5 minutes left on the timer and they thought something was wrong if we were still upstairs looking for eggs, or they would be nice and give us a hint to go downstairs. 

About a week later I told my neighbor about it. He was one of my favorite people because he was super funny and let us ride our bikes up his big driveway. When I told him about it, he immediately looked freaked out. He said that a long time ago (probably about 10 years ago), there was a bad plane crash in that neighborhood. I rode my bike back home and told my mom. She freaked out too, and looked it up, and it was true. Since then, I’ve believed in that shit."

To be honest, at the time I didn’t break up with her because I was too scared that it was a mistake. I brought it up with her that I was pretty unhappy and I subconsciously wanted her to end it. I knew she wouldn’t, because she wasn’t that type of person. She was 100% committed to me regardless of whether or not I was having doubts.

I think that’s what turned it around. I realized that she had her faults just like anyone else, but it’s hard to hate that kind of commitment. It was completely and utterly my own problem, and I got over it. I really just needed to analyze my expectations for other people. 

That being said, my relationship was and is a good one. We don’t have serious compatibility issues. There were no major roadblocks to us being together. I understand that many relationships don’t have that benefit. But in my case, I just had to realize what I had."

It's become extremely popular to push person first language on every disability without asking what people with that disability prefer. In most cases person first is the right way to address them, but autistics are very against it, and so are a large portion of deaf people. This is because autistic people can't be separated from autism, and a lot of deaf people don't like how negative it feels. Saying something like ""person with deafness"" or ""hearing impaired"" just focuses on what they can't do."

I had never taken any French. 

My neighbors are French, and taught me a couple phrases that night (had to go to this class with this lie the next day). I just stuck to those and pretending to be really shy and then spent the next to weeks frantically memorizing French words from the year one curriculum.

18273,"So this is real long but I feel like I need to get it out.

This was back in high school but it fucked me up for a long time. I got an IM from her one day out of the blue saying she liked me so we started dating immediately because high school. Both of our family lives were pretty shit so we kind of clung to each other for mental support. 

We talked non stop and were together every free minute. She would write me love letters and we’d kiss in the hallways in between classes. Your typical head over heels high school shit. I got along great with her family and I was over her house all the time after school. The first time I ate dinner there her dad had me stay sitting after everyone finished to “talk to me”. He proceeded to tell me that all the high ranking government officials are reptiles and explained how you could tell. She immediately pulled me away and apologized about his weirdness. This should have been a huge red flag in retrospect. 

She had some weird quirks and stuff but I was crazy about her so I ignored all the signs. The biggest one I ignored was her talking to an older guy (I think he was out of hs but I cant remember) who had told her he liked her and all this other stuff but “he’s not serious”. I think he was a former friend of her older brother or something. Something about the way he talked to her just made me feel really uncomfortable.

A few months later I told her I was going away on vacation for a week and she started getting weird about it. I couldn’t put my finger on it but something was off. Over that week she was acting really weird. Not answering texts or calls for a day or so which was completely out of character and just seeming like she wanted nothing to do with me. I land from the plane ride home and turn my phone on to a voicemail telling me she cheated on me and it’s over. I was numb. I tried calling and texting but she wouldn’t answer the phone for more than a few seconds at a time. Finally I get her to agree over text to meet so we can talk about what happened. 

We meet at her house a day or so later and it’s awkward but we go for a walk in the snow and I admit I was so desperate to see her that I was trying to act like nothing had happened. Standing in the snow by the lake not talking and just staring out at the ice is something Ill never forget.

After we went inside things took a turn for the worse. Her mom yelled at her for cheating and told me I deserved better than her daughter. It was a horrible thing for a mother to say to her daughter but I didn’t say anything. After this was hours of her hiding under a blanket going between telling me she was going to kill herself out of guilt to not responding to anything I said or did. Eventually I told her I would see her at school and went home. We broke things off and avoided each other as much as possible.

Fast forward to me being in summer school a long time later and I get a text from her out of the blue and we start talking again. A day or so later she swears me to secrecy and drops a fucking bombshell on me. She tells me the guy she cheated on me with and another guy had taken her to a hotel room and raped her. And I’m not allowed to tell a soul but she wants to see me.

We walked to a park nearby her house. We talked about how afraid of him she was because he was so much older and knew people in her life and he had threatened her. I said Id kick his ass like a dumb teenager. We talked about life and our relationship and what happened. It didnt feel real. I left and we didnt talk again until a year or so later when she told me she needed to see me again. This time her mom had pushed her into the edge of a table and fucked up her spine. It was strange. She acted like a different person and things were awkward where they didn’t use to be. It was like she knew I would be there to give her attention but she didn’t actually want me there. She just wanted a body to be around. It happened a few more times before I stopped answering. Each time was someone else in her life had done something horrible and she needed me, then when I showed up she wanted nothing to do with me. She wouldn’t hold a conversation, she would barely look at me.

When I got sent to a therapist a while later I eventually broke down and told him what had happened and how she had made me swear not to tell anyone. He told me that she was lying to make me feel guilty and he pointed out all these different times where she was being emotionally manipulative. To this day I have no clue if she was telling the truth or not. I don’t think I’ll ever know and I’m not sure I want to. 

Now she’s married and they’ve got a kid together. Now don’t get me wrong in no way do I wish it was me with her. Aside from the obvious reasons I also think we’re both way too young to be married or having kids(25). The whole experience fucked with my head for a long long time after it happened. It left me with serious trust issues and a lot of self hatred. I thought I was unlovable and I’m still recovering from that feeling. Now that’s mostly due to my own mental illness, but it has definitely been exacerbated by all of this. 

Anyway I’m not sure how to end this so thanks to whoever reads this.

18278,"Oh man, I wrote a letter to my future self when I was 14 too, pre internet though so it's a physical letter.  
It was to be opened on my 25th birthday and I hid it in a biology textbook I no longer needed and put it in a box in the attic.  
I completely forgot about it, as was the plan I guess, and then found it amongst some of my things that my dad cleared out and gave to me when I was 29.  
It was kinda cringey but also so incredibly sweet. I lived a very solitary life with an abusive and very mentally unwell parent and the letter reflected this without the details. It was more of a correspondence as I'd started it off ""Hallo future, Scanty, how are you? I hope this letter reaches you well and happy"". I asked myself lots of questions about my life, like how I did at uni, did I have any children, what my partner was like etc. The letter ends so hopeful for my future self and that I am finally free of my crappy existence at home.  
It had me sobbing and made me fall in love with 14 year old me, in a way that I wished, with hindsight, I'd had the empathy for myself to feel at the time.

This guy had found a painting from 1913 with crop circles and was trying to find out more about it and its last owner, Benjamin Stove. I love unsolved mysteries and this immediately caught my attention. I dove into the discussion forums on the website and began learning what people had already found out. 

For the next week I was obsessed with this website, this mystery, so much that I would even check it during my free periods and lunch at school. Eventually, the mystery was solved and they found Benjamin Stove. However, the whole thing ended up being [an ARG marketing campaign from GM](http://www.iainlanivich.com/case-studies/gms-who-is-benjamin-stove-alternate-reality-game) so none of it was real.

They did end up mailing me a print of the painting, with a list at the bottom of the people (including me) that were actively participating on the forums. [Here is a picture of it](https://i.imgur.com/U0Bof4A.jpg)

If something is popular, she instantly has to rant about how much she hates it, even if she liked it before it became popular. There's non-stop swearing in daily convo- which I never thought I'd think is an issue because no one else's swearing bothers me, but it's that she's a damn adult and swearing beacuse it upsets her mom and she wants a reaction. She keeps saying she is going to move away to where her internet friends leave (and please, be my fucking guest, LEAVE). I feel like I'm dealing with a teenager. She basically was a pill the entire weekend we were all on vacation. And the cherry on top: we had to pay for our room at the airbnb that his parents invited us to, but she didn't have to pay a dime. My husband just paid money for us to be pissed all weekend and since the entire situation pisses him off, we got in a fight on the car ride back over something completely stupid that doesn't even matter right now.

My parents kept talking to mask the noise and eventually, the couple stopped and started arguing. They realized that we heard everything because the guy kept trying to calm her down as the girl was yelling that she was mortified and embarrassed about the situation.

After going deeper, the room we heard the noise in was absolutely packed with junk, and covered in spiderwebs. No one could have moved around in there. We scoured the entire building and found no such man. 

We went back to double check the room we heard the noise from and discovered a door. We moved the stuff to get to the door, it opened to a small closet. On the wall, drawn in the dust, was a heart. It was clear enough to take a picture, but shortly after my phone was broken, and I couldn't recover anything.

This little heart ment a lot to me. My girlfriend had a family member that was close who was born with a backwards heart. They did the surgeries required as a young child, but it was unable to fully develop. She died at 21 or 22. Every year, they give heart shaped presents. Her family really believes that when they see hearts it's her telling them that she's ok up in heaven. I thought it was just me. But all 4 of us saw and heard it. And too see that heart.

-	Managed 17 clients support and new development alone
-	expected to work 68 hours a week (we were brought in and yelled at because the 60 hour weeks + Saturdays were meant to be 12 hours M-F and 6-8 on Saturday; owner showed up at 9 and left at 3 that day) and I lived an hour away. 
-	always told “we don’t have money for more developers” but the owners both bought new cars — the one’s wife *did* work, but the other had a stay-at-home wife with five kids under the age of 10. The single working parents also bought a motorcycle.
-	blamed my stress level and working less to maintain mental health on “working less and not giving yourself enough time to accomplish tasks.”
-	owner told me to “find a wife” to do my laundry and house work I was also doing while working less
-	annoyed that hourly employees clocked out to take a 3 minute stroll next door to get a snack or drink
-	complained that the small development team (all friends) took lunch together leaving “work” at a stand still
-	complained that friends would take smoke breaks together
-	had an executive, sales and “back room” bathroom - not gender separated. 1 owner used the executive (nicely renovated), the 2 man sales team used the other (somewhat renovated and spacious) bathroom, and the 9 other employees (2 females) had to use the unremodeled, extremely tiny, mold/dirt filled bathroom.
-	refused to give me a proper work email because “they ran out of slots and it’d cost $5/month to give me one.”
-	they tried making employees clock out for bathroom breaks until one threatened to sue for illegality.
-	employees (except sales) had to park in back on a gravel lot that flooded so the actual lot looked inviting for clients that never came in

We both realized the fuck up and sat quietly until the phone rang and it was the cops, we gave my mom the phone and she was furious but ten minutes later the cops showed up and my friend tried to explain that his arms got tied in a pretzel and the whole situation to the officer. He laughed and told us that it was a serious thing to call 911 and how it was only for emergency's. That was the end of it but my mom told us that if it was a false call they would charge us and she'd send the bill to my friends parents, needless to say he did not come over for about a month. We never got charged anything but scared the crap out of us. I still tease him about it to this day. Love that guy."

18494,"I'm a woman. I met my husband when we were teens through a homeschool group. In the homeschool group, at his workplace, and wherever else he goes, women just flock to him. It's crazy. When I first saw him, I just stared at him for a second because I couldn't believe my eyes, lol. I didn't talk to him, though, because I knew he was out of my league. I ended up having to sit next to him because my computer was about to die, and then he started talking to me. We ended up having a lot in common. We both loved fart jokes, music, video games, and Marvel movies. We just hung out as friends until one day he put his arm around me while we were watching Guardians of the Galaxy, and after the movie he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was his first and only girlfriend, and now I am his wife. I don't know how I got to be so lucky. Maybe it's just because we are best friends. Maybe that overrules beauty. "

18496,"This is so true. On multiple occasions, I've been grilled for information by my wife after hanging out with friends.  

It usually starts when i give her a piece  of info that came up that i know she'd want to know.  There will inevitably be some line of follow-up questioning she wants answers to, and never understands how/why I didn't find the rest of it out.  

It ends with some variation of:

""Why didn't you ask [about the other question she wants answered]?""
""I don't know; I guess it just didn't come up.""
""Well then, what did you talk about?""
""I don't know, but not that""
""Ugh! You're useless!""

Honestly, I'm not trying to be difficult. It's just never something(s) that feels necessary to ask in the moment.

Video game machines stuck in various corners, both arcade units and home systems. All kinds of stuff.

Then I realized, of course, that the more they make it easy for employees to stay at the office - the more they **expect** you will. (And of course, no employees were actually playing video games at any point, that I saw over the course of a few days of training.)"

We used to take breaks and fish at Catherby before there were bots, and we used to chat and debate, oten times rather deeply about all manner of subjects long since forgotten.

18556,"One thing though is that as a neurotypical person, it's not easy for me to tell when I'm using language that isn't entirely literal. I don't use irony, body language cues, and different tones of voice to fuck with people or play ""mind games"", I use them because they are a part of my language and how I communicate, and they come naturally to me. They also allow me to express ideas and sentiments that I cannot express fluently using strictly literal language. In &gt;99% of the interactions I have had in my life, this way of communicating has been effective, so it has been reinforced my whole life. 

Looking at the example above, the sentence, ""I think you need to pay a closer attention to the tone you use when you respond to emails"" seems perfectly clear and literal to me. When /u/TytleFight broke it down I could absolutely see how there could be confusion. However, that would not be apparent to me at all and it would take me a lot of time to learn how to reevaluate everything I say and the ways I communicate in order to make it crystal clear for someone with autism. Obviously, if I had to do that for someone I was close to, I would, but it isn't at all as simple as ""just be straightforward.""  "

18622,"I’ve ALWAYS been spiritually sensitive (more in sensing presences and seeing things than hearing anything) and on top of that I’ve been raised in fairy lore from my grandmother who called me her little druid.

I’ve encountered/interacted with no less than 8 entities in my life, including the thing that I blame for said grandmother’s death. 

Leaving work to go home now. If people want stories or more info in general I will be happy to once I have time

edit: I woke up to a ton of replies, so as promised, here goes: (and thanks for taking interest!)

Most of my experiences were pretty general as a child (knowing, with certainty that I was not alone in certain places, seeing the family cat around the house who had died two years previous, etc) but the first major one that happened to me was probably also the worst. July 4th, 2002 my mother and I were leaving my grandparent's place for some errand, and the road from home is laid out in such a way that you drive by the house again once you're on the main road. Something made both of us look back at the house together, and there was a...shadow, crouched on the roof of our house. It was sitting like the thinker and look at its hand. Full July sun and this thing on the roof was ventablack. I had a shiver pass down my spine, like I had just seen something I shouldn't have. Mom and I traded looks like ""did you...?"" ""yeah."" ""Don't tell Nanny, this would freak her out bad.""

We finished our errand and got home, and I stayed a little back and listened when mom asked Nanny (in general terms) what a shadow like this would be. My family is Irish, deeply so, and Nanny was our File (pronounced fill-uh) which means story-keeper. Her response was ""That sounds like a Tommyknocker. They come and knock on windows and doors to get you to open them, so they can come in the house and let in the banshee when it's time for someone to die.""

Nanny fell asleep mid sentence on a car ride that night. The doctor said the stroke would have killed 9/10 people, and the four small ones immediately after would have gotten the last guy. She lost all control of her right side and died (peacefully) two and a half years later.

I've seen that shadow four times in my life, and something awful happened (that I'm aware of) three times. The second was in November the year after the first time. I woke out of a dead sleep, not sure what time it was (you could see the portion of roof the thing was on in the last sighting from my window) and that same thing was peeking over the side of the house at me. black-black fingers gripping the roof molding, and a head I could see because it was darker than the night sky behind it. It had purest white eyes with no pupil, and I felt I was staring at death itself. In the most badass moment in my life, I said ""you shouldn't be here, go away"" rolled over, and went back to sleep.

A week to the day after that sighting, my dog went from fine, to dying from leukemia. (panting, heaving and crying because he didn't have enough red blood cells left to function)

The following summer, around 2:00 AM I saw a shadow dark into my mother's room while I was walking back to mine after grabbing a drink. It was just a momentary thing, but I know I saw...something. I woke mom and she got worried when I told her, but we carried on. She had been hiding gall bladder problems from me to keep me from getting worried, and she began jaundicing a couple days later. Yellow like a simpsons character before she went in for surgery. Doctors told her had she waited any longer she would have died. 

Then many years of nothing. I made contact with a bunch of other things between then and now. Mostly just people, some spirits tied to natural locations, etc. I was hired at a hospital in town as a second shift housekeeper. The hospital in town is haunted as hell. In particular I didn't like the cancer center and the kitchens. The cancer center in particular was a horrible, horrible place (not by reputation, the nurses and doctors there are truly kind and go out of their way to make the patients feel better) I would walk into the area and almost immediately be hit with a wave of hostility and unease so strong I would stop and shiver for a moment every time it hit me. After telling some co-workers I learned the area has had a reputation for bad feelings and seeing thins for years, which makes sense, as it was in the same location as the original hospital building was 120-ish years ago.

When I had to clean in the cancer center, I learned about it.It woke up around 10:00 PM every night, and seemed to have the greatest sway in one half of the unit. I tried my hardest to have that half done before sundown, but couldn't always for various reasons. One of those nights I was vacuuming a long hallway around 10:30 and turned right with the hall. After the turn the hallway continued a ways, let out into the waiting room, and directly across from me maybe 50ft distant was a door that led to the service elevator and staff-only stairs. I saw that same shadow standing there too. It was human shaped, maybe 7ft tall and about two or two and a half feet thick at the hip and shoulder. Its consistency was as if a shadow had peeled itself off the wall. It was facing away, and looked back at me over its left shoulder with those same pure white eyes, and stepped /through/ the door. The hospital I work at is a catholic institution, run by nuns until a few decades ago, but they still visit to make sure the administration is keeping their word to not change how things are run. I say this to let you know that there is a chapel in the building. I also know this is one of the good ones, more on that later. Being a housekeeper (glorified janitor, really) I had keys to more or less the whole building. I left a note in the priest's prep room about the shadow, and how I felt it was necessary to bless the cancer center. 

The priest went to my boss, who got me in pretty massive trouble. Our department head is a mormon, who is of the belief that there are no spirits or things of that nature out there. period. Apparently, I was supposed to go to him with this issue, and to let him make contact with the priest. Yeah, sure dude. That fixed it too...for about two weeks. I noticed that the presence, that hostility, worked its way back out from a particular office, taking about three weeks to completely take the place over again. It was blessed about three times in total, with myself and the girl who had the area as her assigned spot present each time, each with the same result. Eventually an older lady took that girl's place, and Cancer felt clean after that. I don't know what she did, but it drove that thing off.

Well it was a Friday night and my OB was not on call. Another doctor was who was not familiar with my chart and this OB did not care to come in and examine me. So the ER doctor was certain I was just a drug seeker and the OB concurred over the phone. They attempted to admit me to a psych ward because I was deemed a danger to myself and unborn baby with my obvious drug addiction. 

I begged my husband to get me out of there. I needed help. I was in so much pain and my blood pressure was so high I couldn't see straight. He got me out and had to just about carry me. I was afraid to go to any other hospital. I was following my doctors orders. Oh and I actually worked at that hospital. 

Well come Monday morning my husband took me back and that ER doc was fired. I was so sick I was admitted by my OB who decided to no longer share her patient on call duties with the other OB. And I was so sick I had to stay inpatient for a month until I delivered."

Instead of clasped, think of the hands as flat, Left palm up, fingers to the right.  Right palm pressed on top of the left, fingers to the left. Then just slide the right hand smoothly straight across, palms still pressed together, so the fingers of your right hand slide from the inside of your left wrist, straight across your left palm, til your right fingertips reach the underside of your left fingertips. 

Basically it's that, only starting closer to the inside of the elbow instead of the inside of the wrist. And sliding both hands at the same time until your fingertips meet.

18718,"Masking as a general concept is basically ignoring your own social desires to accommodate others' desires, often to your detriment. 

Have you ever been in a customer service job where you're tired , but you have to smile and tell he customer that sure, you'll go out of your way to remake their meal even though it's not your fault they forgot to say no cheese when ordering ? It's that kind of feeling. For the most part yiu know ppl aren't trying to be annoying but your outward social reaction ( smiling, acting like it's not a problem) is different than your inward reaction (wanting to tell them no you're not going to do that bc now perfectly good food is going to waste). 

It's like customer service but your customer is almost everyone you run into. 

For me, it's making small talk with the person sitting next to me in class or chatting w someone bc you want to ask them to do you a favor and you're not allowed to act it outright bc that's considered rude. It's covering up anxiety and not telling someone they're talking a little too loud bc everyone else is fine w their volume. It's forcing yourself not to flinch when a stranger pats you on the shoulder. 

A specific example is this morning when I got on the bus a guy started talking to me , chatting abt how full the bus was. I responded w agreement : it was really full and that was something I could talk abt. But then it became a convo of who I am and my life and suddenly I found myself having to respond and then generate relevant questions abt his life and what he did and there was no way to exit the conversation until I said fuck it and put in headphones bc to smile and ask a complete stranger abt them when I all I wanted to do was get my last moments of silence before my work shift was not my idea of a good time. 

It's hard to put it into words. Bc often it's not all or nothing in regards to masking, maybe you care abt the convo you're having w them, but to really carry out a convo you have to not only listen but generate questions at the same time and make sure you're making eye contact but not too much eye contact and make sure you're somewhat facing them and put all your energy into making sure that what you're doing physically is what you're supposed to be doing. If you're doing that for long periods of time it makes you tense and unhappy and anxious and then it's even harder to do it but you still have to do it so it takes more energy and it's just a spiral. 



The sensitivity stuff can come into it too. My biggest weakness is sound, certain high pitched frequencies hurt my ears and loud sounds hurt and out me on edge. Sudden loud sounds make me jump and I've cried before after a series of them bc I was just so anxious, waiting for the next one to come along and dreading every moment. Often I wear headphones in public and play music bc I know the words and what sounds are happening and I don't have to focus on the screeching of cars and random chatter that floats into my ears. 

Sometimes the sun is super bright, and if I've forgotten sunglasses I can stare down but even on light concrete it feels like the sun is bouncing off it and into my eyes. Think of an overexposed picture on your computer screen at max brightness at night. Just... too bright . 

Other times touch can be an issue. I'm pretty good about touch unless I'm anxious or feeling vulnerable in which case I hate it, to the point where my dad can try to give me a hug and I'll completely tense up. It's not having any space around you on public transport or touch contact w a stranger where even if it was legs touching from simply sitting by one another , you want to scratch your body to distract it w a stranger sensation, you want to curl yourself into a ball where you control your personal space. 

Taste and smell I'm pretty good on, but I hate green beans for example bc if the texture, they feel like rubber with hair on it when I put it in my mouth. Texture kind of goes back to touch so I won't elaborate, but it can def interfere at a dinner party for instance. 



But the masking is overriding everything you want. I don't want to make bodily contact w dome one for an hr on a bus, but I have tried to move over discreetly and they keep spreading their legs and I have no where to go, so I sit in silence on a busy bus and try to shut everything out. And that's my best option bc I (personally, I know autistic people who do) can't drive bc I get over stimulated and zone out and almost hit other cars when I attempt to drive for long periods of time. Masking is being on high alert all the time waiting for something to happen or waiting for you to mess up socially bc it will happen and just getting ready to correct yourself whenever you're abt to do something ""wrong. ""

On a train in the evening in Tokyo, we (me, my husband, and our Japanese friend) we’re standing next to a particularly talkative old drunk man in a sea of old drunk men. Since me and my husband are obviously not Japanese, the man asked where we were from. Our friend told him we were from Georgia, visiting her and her family. The man smiles and begins to tell about how nice georgia is and how much he liked it there many years ago. 

Surprised that he’s been to Georgia, we ask what brought him there. So he tells us about his work for this newspaper as a journalist, and how he was there for a story. Our friend looks mildly confused, and says she’s never heard of the publication he worked for. She looks at us and says “I’m having trouble translating this, he says he is part of a party, like political, the JCP?” It turns out the guy was part of the Japanese Communist Party and thought we were from the country Georgia, not the state. 

Later while we were in Kyoto without our Japanese friend, our mobile WiFi died and we were kind of lost and on a bus. Thankfully this nice older brother and sister from Ohio let us use their WiFi, and since we were going to the same place, let us stick with them so we didn’t get lost again. We climbed the Fushimi Inari shrine with them and then headed our separate ways. "
