It takes a lot more work to make fake fur look and feel real."
1,Is OP retarded? Why or why not?
2,"So, it only benefits others and it wastes my data?  


Sorry, I'll pass"
3,"Oh we've all blocked the pathway jokingly lol.  But uh... you gotta let the other person know you are JOKING so they don't get worried.  And if they say ""for real they have to go"" or say it with a ""serious sigh"" its time to end the joke, relent and let them go.  Usually I do it with a silly face/voice and an eye roll.  For real you gotta let them know you are joking.  You don't corner people or block them."
4,"Blaine was always awful though, he tried to rape Kurt during the first season he was on the show. His character was pretty consistently an asshole.

And Kurt's bully had long ago apologized and Kurt made up with him and was friends with him so it's kind of weird to frame it as being a terrible thing to do for Blaine to date him while they were broken up. Kurt didn't seem to have any problem with it at all."
5,Or because prison is terrifying and inhumane!
6,"knew this is going to happen, but live and let live and just accepting ones opinion doesn’t exist on reddit. next we’re getting therapy suggested"
7,Why would you like someone 16 inches taller than you?
8,"Good

Fuck harleys"
9,When I was in high school I had a huge crush on this guy. We hung out a lot and all of our friends were in the same friend group. It was a perfect little “relationship”. One night we were all hanging out and I was off to the side with him. That’s when he did it. He farted. The smell was so horrendous it was like every ounce of feeling I had for him dissipated faster than his gas. I never spoke to him again after that.
10,"I know, I just felt the need to tell you how much it displeased me to see a butchering of the original"
11,That's the joke.  He obviously made it for class but tried to make it seem like it was a gift for you...
12,Did he touch yours
13,"Best case in Virginia is to drive at least 10 miles UNDER every posted speed limit on highways/Interstates,  and 5 under everywhere else

You may still get pulled over if you have out of state tags, but if you're lucky at least you won't get it for speeding."
14,hitler was also against smoking.
15,"by a slim, sad margin"
16,"Every state except for South Dakota. There are exceptions or particulars that may differ state to state, but 49 have some law regarding this.

17,Yes in an area that didnt trust the police because of corruption and white supremacy. And my main point was things have changed and the second people see anything even semi interesting happening the phone comes out.
18,That allows reasonable people to get the hell out of your god forsaken state as fast as possible.
19,I ask for a lobotomy every year for my birthday. Still waiting.

23,"Fuckin idiot, u so clueless,."
24,"She said she didn't like Han Solo and that she never actually watched Star Wars.

27,Various versions of watchseries! There was also planetfreetv for a while but i think they got shut down. Not certain tho
28,"When your a ""nice kid"" or a ""smart kid"" everyone has high expectations for you. But when they see this side of you... this reminds me with a story,  I am a  serious quiet kid. I mean I can smile to. Usually nice and quiet to adults, smiling (auto correct went to smiling to smoking scared the shit out a me if I accidentally posted that.) When around friends. And weird at home. So I was playing with food(we had corn dogs smiley fries which are emoji smiley faces. And milk. So I used my corndog stick and wiped it with ketchup. And stabbed it into the smiley frie. Then smothered it with ketchup. What a sick mind I have. Also I have nowhere else to share this story sooooooooooo. (Ketchup as blood smiley face as ummm y'know."
29,How peer pressure can make you do all sorts of stupid things
30,"Especially when you're young, I'm 22 and it feels like all the girls my age are still in the ""I want a 6ft bad boy"" stage and then they wonder why their boyfriend always ends up in jail, drugged out, alcoholic and abusive, etc. Not that tall people are horrible, its just the personality type they seem to be attracted too."
31,You assume he meant it.
32,The rest of you don't count. Paris *is* France.
33,Bill Cosby probably
34,"This isn't illegal, OP is full of shit"

37,You spelled bill Cosby wrong
38,"I've been on ate since the past and if I see a girl too flirty &amp; easy, it literally turns me off and couldn't wait to drop her off home and be on my way. 
If a chick is easy on a 1st date, chances are she's got some type of STD. I dont fuck with that shit."
39,"I'd imagine that's not much different than sending a text, blocking, and changing location."
40,A little boys rectum
41,That wouldn't make much sense considering Korea also ended in a loss (at least in the same way that Vietnam is considered a loss.)
42,"And all bartenders go to heaven? Because about 88k people die each year, from alcohol related deaths."
43,"Thats intense. What did she say? How does one justify being caught shitting in a trash can!?

I had the opposite experience. A guy i was seeing admitted that he peed sitting down. Not just when he took a dump, but everytime. I don't know why i found it such a massive turn off, but I like power dynamics in play so maybe that had something to do with it?

 That, and the idea of toilet water splash dick."
44,"Poor excuses.

It’s all a matter of willpower and discipline"
45,"Yup, still doing okay"
46,idk my mommy loves me
47,"&gt;Yes, but as we know the literal definition is not always what words are interpreted as

That is ***BULLSHIT*** of the UTMOST degree

So, let me get this straight: they ARE concentration camps, but we can't use that term because it's associated with something bad? Even though the camps, by your own admission, fit the actual definition of what a concentration camp is?

Fuck you and your pedantic bullshit reasoning."

49,"What the heck are you talking about, ""top voted commenter"" my ass. That's legal. There are official government parking permits hangers"
50,Not really.
51,"First off, I'd get my own affairs in order:-

1. **Pay off my student loans** and voluntarily backpay all national insurance and pension contributions to when I was sixteen. That way nobody can accuse me of ""living off the taxpayer"" any more.
2. **Buy a load of houses.** Move into one of them. Move my parents into another, and give them the titles. Renovate the house we live in now and move back into it. Offer my my best friend and his wife a 100% mortgage so they can buy instead of rent. Same for my brother. Do it that way because neither of them would just accept a house. Start an agency to rent out the rest of the houses, which will provide an income and be an investment for the future.
3. **Cancel my MA application** at the Open University and apply for the equivalent MSt at Oxford. I can now afford to do the thing properly, so why not?
4. **Learn to drive.** I mean FFS I'm 29, it's about bloody time I learned.
5. **Start some small trading on the stock exchange.**
6. **Buy gold.**

Then I'd have some fun:-

1. **Build that bitchen computer I've always wanted.** I'm talking about specs that scream ""he's compensating for something"".
2. **Probably buy a shitload of old radio and tape equipment too.** Because I'm that kind of nerd.
3. **Go on a long holiday abroad.** I've never been abroad before, and it would be nice to go to some of the places I've only ever seen pictures of.
4. **Send my parents on holiday too.** They've never been away either, and it would do them some good.

After all that, I probably still have way more than half my winnings left, in which case I'd:-

1. **Start a charity to provide for local foodbanks and soup-kitchens.** I'd consider just donating myself, but with those amounts of money I'd want to look into finding ways of making it last longer and work harder, for instance by using interest from an endowment to pay for a large grocery shop or two every month. That way the money lasts longer and my efforts will \[hopefully\] outlive me.
2. **Start a scheme with local fast-food joints to offer free food to local homeless**, using a similar endowment to what I've described above. There's lots of kinks that'd have to be ironed out, but I think it could work.
3. **Start a shelter** for the homeless or else donate money toward the expansion of any that already exist in this area."
52,Goes to show that for a woman it means nothing lmao
53,It is not that bad
54,"Oh .. so that's the reason for your sadness. Listen my dear friend, the fact that you acknowledged this is a big thing and shows you have a clean heart. God has blessed with such a great man.. which in it self shows that he wants the best for you. You need to now fight your depression with all these blesssing given. Go for therapy or do something. I wish you the best of luck and a healthy life."

59,So you’re saying I’m a pussy?
60,They don't. I really can't understand why this comment was downvoted like this.
61,How old is your girlfriend that she needs mommy and daddy buying her a pair of shorts?
62,Same with talking about porn related stuff. Easiest way to make an American guy shy away or get uncomfortable? Deadpan ask him how big his cock is or anything related to it for that matter. Works every time
63,That's attracted to a minor's looks
64,Not true. I’ve never seen get mad over this.

70,I don't think the US government really considers Puerto Rico part of the US. I don't think most of my fellow Americans think it either.
71,Whores of reddit*
72,Auswitz disagrees.
73,"No, those diseases correlate with lifestyle factors shared with red meat eaters. As I said, red meat eaters are more likely to smoke, drink, et cetera that causes those diseases. You’re comparing a strict vegetarian diet with the modern American diet. That’s just bad science. Current research shows that red meat is not carcinogenic at all. At all. 

Are you really trying to argue a diet free of carbs causes diabetes? Bro, you aren’t even trying. How do you get insulin resistance when you don’t eat sugars or carbs.

77% of vegetarians and 92% of vegans are deficient in b12: (Herrmann W, et al. Am J Clin Nutr. 2003.)

So no, you can’t look through vegan blood tests to find this. Most vegans have multiple nutrient deficiencies.

I know omnivores use supplements. But you’re comparing a strict vegetarian diet with the common American diet. 


You’re just talking out of your ass. Bring some evidence to the table lmao. This is the issue with vegans. They wanna act like they’re super healthy and moral. They’re not. There’s nothing moral about the vegan diet. 25x as many animals are killed to produce equal amounts of protein. And you’re all nutrient deficient. Time and time again I’ve seen top level athletes switch to vegetarian diet only to lose what made them top notch. That shits toxic for you. Meat is where it’s at."
74,"I don't agree with your analysis in the slightest, and I actually find your attempt to equate it to slavery to be degrading to people of color.   


&gt; There also aren’t large scale sustainable practices for eating meat so don’t kid yourself.

That's not a remotely scientifically accurate statement, but I'm not going to bother to waste the effort because I'm not being listened to anyway.  I post something scientifically accurate, i get downvoted and a different version of the same scientifically inaccurate talking points spewed back at me."

78,"What the hell does ""major continents"" mean? There's only 5 continents, they are all major. Unless you somewhat want to say you wouldn't visit Africa or something like that. 

Maybe you wanted to say you want to visit places, but it's worded poorly."
79,"Which one? The world has many presidents? If ""*THE PRESIDENT""* implies a collective, then for sure I agree most/all politicians are in it to win (for their own gain of power and or control)."
80,"I mean, I haven’t really seen any proof of that. I assure you that I don’t have a problem. I’m a completely normal person who happens to disagree with you."
81,What about people driving while tired.  Do we have a test for that?
82,The only people killing people on a consistent basis and causing terrorism is conservatives.
83,"While I agree with you, as we don't really know the specifics of this particular situation (and as it is easy to jump to conclusions), I've seen a lot of parents who just let kids run wild and are too involved with themselves/lazy to be bothered with actually parenting their children. That's mainly the kind of parents I was talking about."
84,"Not always

But alot of the time"
85,That sounds like a lame excuse to turn into a junkie imo.
86,"That's Ms. I'm not in any way trying to be edgy.  And not in the cases I'm thinking about. I personally know people who have shot out kid after kid, and do little to absolute zero to parent said kids. These are the people I'm talking about.  In a response to a separate comment on this particular post, I said that none of us know all the details of the situation with this child. Someone suggested he needed medical/professional help, and I agreed that might be the case.  I'm just saying there are so many people who are too lazy/self involved that don't want to be bothered with actually paying attention to or raising their own children."
87,"What part of the smell scares you? Could you ask him to blow his toke out the window? Him smoking weed is probably 10x better for his well being than being on anti anxiety pills or anti depressants.

89,"I never went to the doctor to find out what happened but I had diarrhea that was almost all blood and even had congealed pieces of blood in it. It hurt so bad I started questioning my life choices, I prayed to God and told him I’ll be a missionary if he took the pain away, I said I’d go to church 3 times a week, I said I’ll never use curse words again, and the pain even made me wonder if life was worth living if there’s a chance I would have to feel this pain again. All in all It lasted about 10 minutes. Oh and I had just gotten back from Africa 1 week before and had pneumonia and was coughing up blood when this happened."

91,"Hmmmm. I think WANTING to fuck kids, while far from ideal or good, is okay, because I don't think people choose that for themselves and I don't think the desire is intrinsically harmful to anyone. Fucking kids is obviously far from okay."

They are creating complex parameters that are unnecessary for population studies to create job security because they know their education is for the most part useless. Every healthcare degree employs psychology to a certain extent. I have had to take plenty of psychology for my degree. It is a tiny part of actual clinical work yet somehow these people make an entire profession of it with fluffy bullshit meant to take away your beer and put a xanax in your hand instead and call you cured.

116,I have no doubt it can be incredibly useful.  I myself have ADHD and perhaps part of my bias stems from personal experience but i stopped taking amphetamine salts beginning of college because they made me feel like a zombie.  The studying and focusing got tons harder but i pushed through while I watched kids without ADHD basically cheat with these drugs.  So now whenever I have a potential ADHD patient I will admit I'm perhaps over conservative.
