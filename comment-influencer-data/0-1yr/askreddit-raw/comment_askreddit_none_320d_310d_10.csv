Then one day a few years later after a fat bong toke I realized I wasn't better than everyone and I was a huge douchebag. People are just different. I'm really lucky I still have the friends that I do and even though we live on opposite coasts we talk every day and play an MMO game we played in middle school together a couple times a week. 

In hindsight as well, though, when I first moved to that town in 5th grade I got bullied alot. I had to beat up several kids to get some respect. I immediately gained friends by putting mean kids in their place. Then puberty hit me hard and I was shaving by mid 6th grade and I dominated in all my organized sports. "

110,"&gt; Health - medicine and doctor visits

This doesn’t really capture it, though. Yes, money can buy you the best care that’s medically possible today. Human medicine is still incredibly rudimentary. No matter who you are, you will still age, and you will still die. If you get cancer, you will not automatically be cured just because you can see a good doctor. I think that’s what is meant by “money can’t buy you heath”. It can’t cure cancer and it can’t make you stop aging.

&gt; Friends/family ... transportation, phone   
      
The bar to be able to physically visit family or call/chat them on the phone and Internet is very, very low. I agree that living in literal poverty makes many things hard. However, I don’t think we’re primarily talking about literal poverty here. Beyond that, having lots of money often requires working a job that takes an incredible amount of time and effort, which can seriously harm familial and friend relationships.

Why do women deserve rights?

weak argument

&gt; But if you mean inferior as weaker, then yes, you’re half right, normally men are stronger. However, women can of course get fit and strong as well, sometimes even stronger than men.

An average male is way stronger than a woman that exercises. Even heavy lifting. The only way a woman has even a chance is to juice or face a male with low testosterone."

Alright. Gloves are off.

There is a [shit-ton](https://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/race-and-iq/) of evidence suggesting a racial disparity in intelligence. Take the [Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study), for example.

The American South is more racist than the North, and has more experience with blacks. Americans are more racist than Europeans, and they have more experience with blacks. What does that suggest to you? Should we believe the people who have more or less experience with blacks?

Education doesn't increase intelligence by much. Either you are smart or you aren't. Most experts agree that intelligence is about [80% nature and 20% nurture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ)."
