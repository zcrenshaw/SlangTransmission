4,"People dont have kids ""just to scam the system"".  If you are talking about people who have kids without wanting/planning them, that is about education and access to resources.  Also, who would your judges be as to who could have a kid?  What possible criteria could you come up with to encompass every unique person?  You certainly cant base a test on economics, nor on education, nor on anything else for that matter.  There are no rules to evolution and procreation, they both always find a way.

7,"And if a cop genuinely does fear for their life in a situation, should they just do nothing to defend themselves?

There are cities where murder happens on the daily, and it isn't at the hands of cops."
8,"&gt;How would building the wall be worth the cost considering that the majority of illegal immigrants over stay visas?

We still have ICE, right? Deportations would ramp up since we won't necessarily have to focus on our southern border

 &gt;Are you concerned with people who do cross illegally simply going over or under it as they already do?

Nope. Drone strikes to take care of people climbing over and we have ground penetrating radar to detect tunnels

&gt; Is it worth the cost considering illegal immigration has been steadily falling for about two decades?

Do walls work, or do they not? All we are asking for is for common sense immigration policy. If a wall curbs immigration, then yes the cost is inconsequential.

&gt;What about the fact that illegal immigrants contribute more in tax revenue then they cost?

31,"I'm going to respectfully disagree.  A while back I knew of someone who was sexually abused, their mother would watch through the window and masturbate as it happened, and once I tried to come out in support of them and try to get them removed and the abusers prosecuted I was told in absolutely no uncertain terms it wasn't my business and I could be facing harassment charges if I continued to pursue the matter.

It is unfortunate that those who are innocent are harassed, and those who are guilty are let free.  I do not have the answer myself, but getting back to OP's question if someone had a lot of money to get a bunch of lawyers together maybe they could find the right answers.

I'm upset what happened to you, it wasn't fair, but what happened to this other person (and their own mother thought it was sexually amusing, sick) also disgusts me, and it indeed was powers that be that allowed it to continue."

Further, supply and demand is a thing. If the demand for those jobs is high enough, the cost (wages) will naturally rise. That's how a market works. If the wages are low, that's the market telling you that demand is lower than the supply. Yes, we need those jobs, but what the low wages tell us is that there's more than enough people capable of doing those who are willing to do them. If there weren't, the wages would rise until the supply meets the demand."

74,"&gt; Apart from the fact that it's just damned vulgar (straight dudes seem to have no compunction about using this kind of language in the workplace or in family settings where they'd never otherwise refer to sex at all)

I agree, that those ""sayings"" are vulgar and shouldn't be used so explicitly in a very professional work environment or in family situations. 

Because if you are not gay, any anal sex done to you or having to perform fellatio is rape to you. The metaphors all imply coercion or non-consent. 

If a woman, who happens to be a lesbian, says ""I'm stressed at work, this project I'm working on is like I'm taking it up the butt from two fat bikers"" 

First she's imply rape (non-consent), then the rape act is a worse kind of rape to her i.e. in the butt (butts don't allow easy penetration, especially during non-consent), then she is implying its twice as bad (because its two fat bikers instead of one person), AND their FAT bikers vs two very attractive models or something (so somehow that's worse). But the implication of her saying it, is that she is a lesbian (or a straight man) who wouldn't neccesarily consent to having anal sex with two fat bikers, so it's a very very bad situation for her/him to be in. 

IF, you were specifically a person who enjoys taking it up the butt from two fat bikers, you would not necessarily jump to the conclusion that the metaphor implies a bad hardship, non-consent type situation. 

Strangely, people have always said bringing sex into the workplace was bad or unclassy, however with the growth and acceptance in society of gay people, transgender people, and even the popularity of Sex in the City and Fifty shades of gray, pop culture metaphors are increasingly becoming sexual, because sexuality in general is becoming more accepted. 

So, if your specific sex life isn't based around non-consent, then when people who aren't you make metaphors that are sexual that are part of pop culture, your sex life isn't the focus of the joke, rape/non-consent is, so it isn't demeaning, you are possibly taking it the wrong way. "

The comment to which I replied stated that the “US isn’t even #1,” and though vague, within the context of productivity, this is wrong being that the US is indisputably #1 regarding GDP.

So if your argument is that by working more (resulting in the #1 GDP of all nations), US citizens are less happy then obviously that is correct. "

From the Lexicon...

*“A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the others are its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life means the right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action—which means: the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.)*

*The concept of a “right” pertains only to action—specifically, to freedom of action. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference by other men.*

*Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive—of his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary, uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obligations on them except of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.*

*The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.*

*Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values”*
