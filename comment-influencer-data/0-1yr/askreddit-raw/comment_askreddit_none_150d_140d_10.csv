MBA: Mostly Bullshit Anyway."
1,"Do the calculus, all the Double Dry Hopped IPAs that are the most popular right now are all over 8%."
2,People like you will just stay ignorant no matter what. But the world needs people like you so thank you.
3,"&gt; I wasn't going to miss my chance to say out loud that he was fired.

So you got him UI in the meantime?  Awesome."

5,"In woodwork my friend pulled out his phone to search up designs to burn into his wood (Not meant to have phones in woodwork)
After that someone asked him ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the time‚Äù instead of looking at his phone he looked at his watch. About a minute later someone else asked him ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the time‚Äù once again he looked at his watch. 

Since then he has proved himself to be quite dumb.

Sorry about bad formatting I‚Äôm on mobile üò¨"

10,Sorry about that dude i'm sorry
11,And Donny boy isn‚Äôt? With his bros Jeff epstine and bill Clinton ü§£
12,"Who said anything about atrophy?  That‚Äôs what happens when you don‚Äôt exercise.  And no reason for rudeness.  You can build muscle that is stronger but leaner.  Doing high weight low rep exercises will make you stronger than someone who does lower weight, middle rep exercises.  The best way to build muscle size is to maintain a weight where you can do about 10-13 reps with proper form.  Someone who does higher weights so they max out at 5 reps per set will become stronger but not as big.  Now both weightlifters will be able to get huge if they are working out consistently, and of course each builder will get stronger as they get bigger and vice versa, but the person who lifts more weight but gets less of the ‚Äúpump‚Äù will get stronger faster than they get big.

I suggest watching Pumping Iron.  It‚Äôs a great documentary that can give some insight into how building muscle actually works.  I would also suggest watching Nanny 911.  It can give you insight into how you can change your behavior instead of acting like a spoiled child who rushes to throw insults"
13,"A lot of the time, if someone is tailgating me as I'm passing they zip over to the right before I'm a safe distance in front of the person I'm passing. Especially if I'm passing a semi - they'll zip right and pass me there with barely a car length between them and the giant truck."
14,Look at it this way. Do you really want to be in a relationship with someone that communicates important things like interest and attraction by dropping vague hints? Ya dodged a bullet.
15,"Had to downvote to take from 666 to 665. I'm sorry, its the work of the god"
16,"I agree. America has become an extremely liberal country, they can't make jokes about anything anymore. The guy who made the Vietnam colony joke would be fired immediately in the US and probably blacklisted from the industry.

In Europe we don't have as much protection for the freedom of speech in general, but are still allowed to be authentic and politically incorrect, so to speak."
17,Inhaling it is definitely more dangerous than injecting it.
18,Russia even in its weakened economic and military state still has more of an international presence than France or Germany.
19,"Whelp, my (white) ancestors immigrated to the American south in the early 1800s and owned cotton and peanut farms. My great grandmother still has our ""family bible"" which is sort of a written history of our family, and it mentions numbers and names of slaves that were forced to work on said farms. It's really disheartening and I do everything I can to check my white privilege since that's the only thing I can control."
20,Using the idea of being gay as an insult is homophobic.

29,It's a trap
30,Two people meet in training camp during war and fall in love and live happily ever after. Sorry but that would make for a shit movie
31,"Bitch ass little fuck shit kids, disobey the orders. I would have shot them. You need to heed your elders"
32,"Yeah, I‚Äôm good thanks for asking! What‚Äôs your day been like?"
33,"&gt;  If the host invites you to a party the host pays particularly if you're a child/teen.

Nah dude that's not a rule of life. People can do what they want, they just need to tell you in advanced. Obviously the 14 year old isn't paying out of pocket, which is generally why you tell the parents."
34,Count your blessings my man.
35,Manson was innocent
36,r/protectandserve is full of the fascist pricks but they're not here. I wonder why.
37,you think there's no overlapping there?
38,"Me, a freshmen. I am taking a path I didn't expect. Considering doing some drugs, I understand it is illegal, but still want to try. What can I say, I'm a curious guy."
39,They promote forcing ppl to accept biological untruths.
40,"Might be non shameful to you, wouldn't be non shameful to me."
41,"The only problem when people cite stuff from other countries is these countries are not as large as America.

I‚Äôm sure you can make a lot of good shit work in smaller countries but I imagine it‚Äôs way harder to implement in a much larger country.

I‚Äôm all for anything that helps drug users though just comparing a system in a small country doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate to a much much larger country."
42,Ah. False meritocracy.

50,Communists
51,Once again proving my point and choosing the same tactic. Try fighting ideas with ideas instead of battering the people who possess them.
52,"I would pay anyone to stop the ""if you had x dollars and were blank what would you do"" ask reddit questions"
53,"So... By your logic, when you're familiar with someone, you're more okay with being touched inappropriately by them?

If you closely examine rape and sexual assault statistics, the vast majority of them are perpetrated by people *known* and trusted by the victim- close friends, family, and immediate relatives.

Just because you're familiar, doesn't mean you cannot feel violated by the actions of a loved one."
54,"Very well, ""to an extent"". Being made by the same company doesn't take away from the setting though."
55,Overpopulation is a myth.
56,"Hi lonely, nice to meet you."
57,"Slaves still existed, women didn't have rights, cars aren't invented, many nations aren't nations yet, N. And S. America haven't been discovered yet."
58,"For how long this story was, it was dramatically uninteresting."
59,They get really deep if you care about paying attention to the characters and their motivations. But if you go into it without caring then you won't begin to get invested and you won't enjoy it. I'm not saying you have to care I just think that people see those movies as being more shallow than they actually are.

61,"When my husband died, my oldest song became king. I always knew he was a little different, but he became a complete monster with more power. He killed the lord of the north, which put the country in to a civil war. Thankfully he died during his wedding."
62,That was the year Trump was elected President.
63,Did you knock him out?
64,I read that as MAGA and it wasn't wrong!
65,"Whenever a movie is getting hyped based on racial &amp; gender basis, it turns out be disappointing. Wonder Woman &amp; Captain Marvel was high disappointing because of storyline &amp; subpar acting. Acting is what Sam &amp; Jaime showed in GOT S8E1. Captain Marvel's existence turned out to be a lie &amp; she acted like nothing happened, it really disturbed me. Brie &amp; Kid was annoying was af. Only thing I liked about the film is acting of Sam Jackson."
66,"I firmly believe, there is a time and a place where punching a nazi is the right thing to do."

78,Were you Russian or were you Dragon?
79,"What is an incel? Because I've always thought incels were the awkward nerdy guys that have the ""cartoon"" girlfriends or wifus (I think what what it's called) but now I'm not sure after reading this thread."
80,It's easy to stalk someone online.. Trust me..
81,"""extremely uncomfortable""???? there are so many ways to defuse the tension after that."
82,"That people take drugs top escape a shitty life situation. 

Anyone doing it for ""fun"" comes off as unable to entertain themselves in a more constructive way or without impeding their mental faculties.

If we find some legitimate medical use for it i have no issue with it but so far all the studies on it, and other psychedelics, require a spiritual experience in order to have any sort of change."
83,Lol child

86,NANI?!?
87,You had to say r/woooosh silly
88,"Hah! Look at this comment and thread and tell me that society isnt sick. The kids are born to parents who dont want them, in a failed relationship, they're abused, undoubtedly manipulated, and given all the power they need to ruin their parents name at such a young age, and people are still blaming the kid.

No, the kids actions are a symptom of a larger problem, namely that OP had a child irresponsibly, and the child's father clearly didn't want him, and his uncle was even worse. That kid is reacting to his situation, and his situation is a world of shit. 

What he did was use the only power he has in his life right now, probably because his parents hate each other (beyond his control) he was sexually abused (beyond his control) his family is broken (beyond his control) is it any fucking wonder he's lashing out? Can anyone claim they wouldnt lash out in these circumstances even as an adult? 

OP, you fucked up by not being absolutely sure that relationship wouldnt fuck itself at soon another kid came into the equation. You and his father are responsible for every single bad thing that has happened to that child. He has every right to hate you, and his father too. I don't blame him one bit."

92,"I would bet money that he's holding onto them until like 2-3 weeks before the election. 

Everyone will make a big fuss about corrupt he must be because he won't release them and then he pulls the rug out from under that argument at the last minute."
93,Which is not $10.
94,"And that's your opinion. Other people have different opinions. Also the entire point of this thread is supposed to be about overrated MOVIES, not genres people are tired of."
95,"Finding Nemo

People lost their minds for that film and I personally didn‚Äôt get it, I found Dory insufferably annoying and I didn‚Äôt find the film funny"
96,He didn't have to. He won.
97,"Ya but the thing is whoever girl that he grabbed to put her head by his crotch, she most likely went back home with him obviously consensually. He's not just being a creepy guy on a bus that you want nothing to do with. I'm sure he regrets doing that head shove thing as well but I wouldn't call it sexual assault. It's a thin line"
98,"If you're so fat you have trouble walking and people move away from you when you sit next to them because of the smell, then your first thought during a conversation shouldn't be that a slim woman half your age wants to jump your bones."

102,That's racist!
103,"Not really. 

It's about 25 miles to our nearest decent hardware place. So probably a good two hours round trip, plus maybe $10 fuel costs. That's if the shop even had one. 

Add the time spent messing about with it and you're talking about $30 spent to save maybe a few minutes of labour. Assuming it even worked."
104,"hello there, second account"
105,"OP just asking the question to get it themselves. 

Old bait. Just fucking pathetic. If he really wanted to know that, there are enough AskReddit threads about that."

112,You can put a monkey up against Trump in 2020 and IT will win. He's lost tons of voters and a positive rating hovering around 40% is unelectable.
