1,"The problem is you are the racist here.  You are bring up derogatory terms aimed directly at a racial group.  When you are called out for using genetic guilt, you clutch your pearls and double down.  I get you are a racist, you revel in it.  But understand when you get called out on being a racist, you can't really hide from the term.

What happens to societies that go to racebaiting like you are doing now?  It doesn't end well.  People self segregate, they blame people based on race and wars happen.  If you look at the political divide in the nation that has been caused directly by people using genetic guilt concepts its getting worse.  You have people significantly smarter than you stating that a civil war is actually possible in the US for the first time a century.  

Perhaps you should should look at your racist views and quit spreading hate.  Otherwise, if the country does devolve down into civil, remember you told you are using genetic guilt and its consequences.  A better line of reasoning would be to address poverty by social class and not by race.  "
2,I've always disagreed a little bit on the definition of insane. Someone doing the same thing over and over while getting similar results seems more like they are stubborn or dumb but idk about insane. Insanity to me sounds more like a mad person. Where did this newer popular definition come from? Is it the original definition?

Yes. When you do something 5000 times, it's not as special. The traditional aspect of it doesn't matter.

Loose.

&gt;So much slut shaming in this

And regardless of what you read on Reddit...your friendships with those of the opposite sex (that are single) is pretty much done...or at least only hang out with them in front of your spouse. They're the only person you need to confide in...and you need to start building that trust. Finally, never believe divorce is an option. Unless you're talking about something extreme like infidelity (I know everyone is different on this), Never even have it be an option on the table.

18,"Depends what you call canon. You can say that only episodes 4-6 are canon. YOu can also say that only episodes 1-6 are canon. Or now with new episodes you could say that all star wars films are canon and in new films Luke was revealed as Grey Jedi afaik. Anyway there are dozens of books from SW universe, I have no idea how much official they are but I am pretty sure that in order to write book from SW universe you have to be enabled to do so in some way (same story with warcaft books and warcraft books are considered canon) byt trademark holder. You can definitely not just write a book that twists story in some way that owner of trademark does not agree with. There are also games like SW:KOTOR and so on.  I am pretty sure to use trademark you have to go throug some kind of check which includes the story line tbh. 

I persoanly would consider everything canon, be it films, games or books. And new SW films, books and games have all used term Grey Jedi."

30,"I would prefer more action, but there are perfectly good substitutes for it: drama and suspense can easily fill in. Thing is, 2001 didn’t really have much of any of that. The vast majority of the movie had absolutely nothing compelling about it, action or otherwise.

As for the cinematography, maybe that’s the wrong word for me to use. There’s no denying that the movie was ahead of its time with regard to the special effects used, but the issue is that those special effects weren’t used *for* anything. There’s a difference between having very advanced-for-the-time special effects and actually putting those effects to good use to make the movie compelling. The bizarre ending sequence was very impressive from a technical standpoint but totally shit from an entertainment standpoint. I didn’t feel more drawn into the plot by it. It didn’t create suspense. It didn’t create a more immersive sense of realism. It just made me say “wtf is this shit?”

2001 works great as a demo tape for special effects technology of the time. Not so much as a movie. I’d contrast it to Mad Max: Fury Road. *That* was a movie that put special effects to good use. They support the movie, rather than the movie supporting them."

36,"Very few allegations of sexual impropriety are false, unfortunately (statistically 2-3 in every 1000 cases). #MeToo is a lot of things, but one thing it is NOT is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a means for some people to push erroneous allegations against people for personal reasons.

What nearly every woman has to endure to tell their stories is ruinous to their very lives. But even when men (Terry Crews comes to mind) relate their stories, they are treated with the same disdain. So I feel #MeToo is more of a way to stand up to our “rape culture” by joining our stories together. People who care will hear. And people who don’t... mark themselves pretty strongly also."

And claiming others are saying that too, which they aren't.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. You're interpreting information to fit what you want. Others are saying, and what doctors will tell you, that you shouldn't quit *cold turkey.* not that you shouldn't quit. They will **absolutely** tell you you should quit.

But talking to the general laymen Reddit audience, it's more simple to say Mono/Poly Unsat Fats &gt; Sat Fat &gt; Trans Fats."
77,"Fat is a macronutrient and sugar is a micronutrient. The whole comparison just makes no sense. What about carbohydrates vs saturated fats or fiber vs protein. Saturated fat is linked to heart disease and fiber leads to better digestion but that doesn't mean carbohydrates are better than fats across the board.

Carbohydrates and fat are both necessary in a balanced diet and should be consumed via healthy options low in their respective negative micronutrients.

Furthermore, consumption of high amounts of fat is dufficult to achieve while maintaining low saturated fat intake (and the more controversial dietary cholesterol intake). However, it is easy to consume carbohydrates low in sugar. Therefore, it is not a good idea to get the minimum amount of carbohyrates and maximize fat intake (assuming the calorie intake is equal)."

Intelligence doesn't make one animal more special than another. That doesn't make you inherently better at all, and saying that totally disregards how stupid and evil humans are. It's nonsensical.

You say it not because it's true, but because it currently benefits you.

You can't own another living thing. They're not consumer goods to be bought and sold. They're not property. They're above monetary value. They're not toys for your amusement, or tools for you to use as you please. We're not their owners, we're their carers.

Pet isn't an insult. That's horrible. A pet is an animal of another species, in your family, that you care for. Species is irrelevant to family.

That's not to say Democrats have not had their moments of crazy, but they always knew where the off switch was so it didn't carry over for long.

The worst of the matter is that if everyone was allowed to vote equally then the Republican party would no longer exist, at least not in its current state.  They have been corrupting states and counties one at a time since the 1980s with all sorts of voter suppression tactics to stay in power.
