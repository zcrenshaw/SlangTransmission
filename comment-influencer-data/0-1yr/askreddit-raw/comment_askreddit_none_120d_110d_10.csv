1,"Not necessarily.

Source: me"
2,"It wasn't really until reading this thread that I realised I prefer You're welcome, but I couldn't pin down why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's because ""No problem"" turns the focus of the sentence on to you. ""\*I\* had no problem doing that""

Whereas ""You're welcome"" the focus is on the other person. ""\*You\* are welcome""

You're welcome seems to make it more personal, more human.

""Thank \*you\*""  

""\*You\*'re welcome"""
3,well you think global isn't real.. were you homeschooled or shit?
4,"Pro-life (for the most part, except in cases of rape/the baby being unable to survive outside the womb). 

I believe any woman who is pregnant and scared should have the chance to thoroughly discuss her options. I think churches with pro-life followings should put their money where their mouth is and offer to help women who would choose to keep their baby if not for the financial struggles. I hope that one day, as a nurse (and hopefully one that makes good money), I can find resources for women who, as I’ve said, would keep their baby if not for the financial struggles. Heck, I wouldn’t mind starting a volunteer babysitter program for mothers who can’t afford daycare. Obviously with proper verification to ensure that babysitters are safe. I know a few elderly couples who wouldn’t mind having another baby around but who are wayyyy too polite to ask a stranger, “Hey, can I take your baby for a while?”

Nurses can make excellent money, so if I go far enough, I could sink my own money into it. My goal would be to build a community that can support mothers who choose to keep their babies. I think that’s what churches should be doing at this moment."
5,"Complete accident or not that thing is still a life right? I don’t believe anyone has the right to take away a life that couldn’t even be judged. Had no good or bad in it. It’s unfortunate but I won’t sugar coat it, they did kill someone. It’s interesting people who are pro choice seem to de humanize the life which makes it easier to separate from the act. But that’s one of the issues right. Putting  an end to ones life especially one that can’t be judged is murder."
6,"Some people knit, others like decoupage or carving.  My craft is weaving a tapestry with words.  It's consumable art, that I made, just for you.  I am glad we could share this moment across the ether.  Friend."
7,its cringy when i saw my fellow 16-year olds open packs of silly bandz to get animals they want while each arm has 5 silly bandz
8, Exactly. We'll both stay in our little drew world.  ;)
9,"Republicans think democrats are stupid. Democrats think Republicans are evil. This is why there can be no compromise, mostly from the left, and why I think Trump will be reelected. When you constantly tell people they are ""the problem,"" they are certainly not going to engage in dialogue with you. You've just proved you don't respect them."

15,"Seriously, the only logical think would be to destroy all humans. We're the worst thing they could've ever happened to the universe. The earth will eventually disintegrate into our sun many millions or billions of years from now, but we will probably kill ourselves off long before then. We suck."
16,Well to be fair Ben afleck should shut the fuck up most of the time.
17,"Tbh I don't think it's as terrible as you feel it to be... I know my friend sent me a picture of her cat with his ears pulled back so his eyes were squinty with the caption ""Asian Kovu""... I drew a picture of him with a rice hat and the same caption. But I don't think it was racist, it's just a cat looking silly and having fun with the depiction.

Idk. I guess my view on it is that unless you're expressing you think the members of a race are all like xyz or that they have negative traits then it's wrong, but making silly jokes and stuff in light-hearted fun isn't."
18,"When a girl is done with you, she is DONE. You are EJECTED like a stale VHS cassette"
19,This guy gets it.  I'm not saying sexual harassment is ok.  Putting other people's tabs on someone else's tab is NOT ok.
20,"You are delusional. If it's a majority opinion from all 'popular mediums' then have you heard this sentiment being brought up in Parliament or as a bill, that states black people are allowed to say anything derogatory to other races, because they can't be racist? You haven't. If that happens then you are allowed to bitch about it as much as you want, but they have the right to say crazy shit like that as much as you have the right to whine about how ALL liberals say black people can't be racist."
21,You made something up and it was wrong. It's not personal. .
22,Someone called me a liberal. I stabbed him repeatedly. No idea if he survived.

30,"Was it like an important artifact? I don't see why this is bad, per se. Then again I don't know too much about the ol' schwitz."
31,"It’s important to point out that that German was a regular Wehrmacht soldier, so although it’s not a character that is developed in the film it’s safe to assume he was just a conscripted soldier exactly like Melish who just happened to be German. He wasn’t a rabid anti Semite frothing at the mouth to kill Jews. Even as he’s brutally killing Melish with the knife he’s going “Shhhh” and you can tell he’s only doing it because it’s that or he’s on the other end of that knife. It’s a really gritty and human aspect of that film. Saving private Ryan has a lot of that humanity in it which is what makes it such a gut wrenching and amazing movie."
32,"By the way, nonetheless is one word. Slight BoneAppleTea."
33,I'm 'sparking a conversation'. Problem?
34,"I mean, you should doubt all these stories. Obviously if people are gonna craft a lie of a post, it's either gonna be believable based on what is public knowledge, or outlandish to get attention.  

&amp;#x200B;

Kevin Spacey's a person known to have engaged in predatory behavior. This story isn't more likely true or not because you know that he has done similarly, because if OP was lying... he knew that too.

I don't think it's more likely a lie than not, but I doubt basically every post here. Basic skepticism behooves you to as well."
35,"You can be as polite as you want, but they’re gonna drag you down to their level."
36,The whole point of conservatism is that they don't have any ideas. They like things the way they've always been for decades.
37,"Because the livestock will be eventually killed and eaten. Meanwhile, we have an overpopulation of dogs. Some countries even castrate street dogs.

Besides, why do you want to breed your dog? There are hundreds of homeless dogs waiting to be adopted. Is adopting an already existing dog not good enough for you?"
38,"Because none of that stuff should be solved by killing the child. I agree that those are extremely big problems, however there are other ways to solve/PREVENT those problems without murder."
39,"Watch the TV show ""The Wire"", if people actually live like that it's a wonder that they don't perform worse on standardized tests."

42,"Anarchy definitely does not equal the left. 

The left is very much rule based. You have to belong to the right victim groups and the value of your opinion is entirely bases on said victim groups.

62,"Had to look it up.

This scene was fucking dumb.

Why didn't the people with the funny helmets just synch up their fire and aim at different parts of his body? The light Saber can only cover so much area. You'd think this would be standard training in a universe where force users exist.

And why didn't Dark Vader run? He walked and the good guys got their package out to safety. If he ran they'd easily have stopped him.

Just makes Dark Vader look like a fucking dumbass."

69,"That's bullshit. German night fighters had large ""horn-like"" antennas indeed, while British and American night fighters like the Mosquito NF variants or the P-61 Black Widow had it in a nose radome, but they weren't exactly tiny either and definitely could not be fitted to the smallest fighters like the Spitfire. All radar equipped night fighters in WWII were twin-engine, multi-seat planes because radars were heavy and required a dedicated radar operator."
70,"Ah I wish that was my story. This stray cat I sort of took in found a baby rabbit and was ""messing"" with it but not killing it, it was bleeding and hurt. I took my axe and chopped it's head off to put it out of it's misery 😭  
  
I don't even like cats so I had a tiny urge to do the same to the cat but I'm not an animal killer. He's really pushing his luck though, he's left dead rabbits, mice, etc. on my front porch in pools of blood. Mother nature's a bitch."
71,"Of course you can't come up with anything better. By saying that, you've proven your inferiority. You are definitely suffering from transference issues. You should go talk to a therapist."
72,I agreed with you until this one. The magic genie sex change would actually be legit.

74,a high school in the US
75,"I think we're in agreement for the most part. It seems like the primary point of contention is over how you decide if someone is mentally capable of deciding whether to engage in sex, and maybe as well as how the eremenos (sorry, I don't know how you typed in Greek, I'm also not fluent in Greek) may have seen the whole ordeal. 

It's hard to pick a specific point in time when someone is capable of deciding to engage in intercourse. Maturity is difficult to measure objectively, and even if someone isn't completely mature why is it a bad thing for them to voluntarily engage in sex? I've known 25 year olds too immature to be trusted with car keys and 10 year olds with their shit more together than me. If a 15 year old has sex and regrets it later, why is it substantially worse than singing in your highschool talent show and forgetting the words? Either way, the person regrets participating in it later and it can't be undone, but neither has more traumatic implications than the other as far as I can tell (assuming no pregnancy/STD, which is a topic for a different discussion). Should that 25 year old guy be prevented from having sex because he's immature? I think our society makes a much bigger deal out of sex than they used to. Obviously I can't travel back in time, but it just seems like they were more casual than most people are today. They don't seem to have seen sex as having huge implications (especially between men, since no pregnancy). 

Also, the prospective erastes may have been looking forward to his relationship, as many people do with their respective rite of passage. I looked forward to getting my license, but my brother dreaded it and is still terrified of driving 3 years later, despite having his license and a car. I talked to a guy from Africa (can't remember where, specifically) who told me about how he looked forward to being circumcised because it meant he was finally a man, despite the excruciating pain that would inevitably accompany becoming a man. A friend of mine lost his virginity because he felt the social pressure to lose it, and now he regrets losing it when he did. So, like you said, some customs seem strange or horrifying to us, but some people look forward to them. I don't see why things related to sexuality should be exempt from being a rite of passage, so long as a person isn't literally forced into it (in which case it obviously isn't ethical). Social pressure will also always accompany a right of passage, otherwise the rite of passage would fall out of use. I don't see the pressure to lose one's virginity as any less damaging than the pressure to become an eremenos, but at least the latter opened up opportunities to learn and to expand your social/cultural capital. 

Sorry, I feel like I'm rambling and I'm having a hard time being concise, today was a crazy day at work and I really need sleep. 
I think it's also worth mentioning that I'm nowhere near pro-pedophile, I'm actually asexual so I have a different perspective on sexual topics and sexual orientation than most, and I find it hard to relate to most people in these respects."
76,"Yes you can do very many things. But if you just did things the normal way, whiteness and cleanliness correlates moderately strongly. Yes there are people who actively whiten their teeth, and there are those who do it without actually brushing. But I'm sure the majority of people just brush with some weak whitening agents. That's what I meant by it doesn't need to be perfect. A trend is there, even if there's variation. Visual checks exist in very many places, even in buildings where a mistake could cost thousands of lives. The fact is, most of the time, the visual check gives a good enough idea."
77,There is no such thing. The soul is religious propaganda made to make subjects fearful of disobedience at the threat that you cannot escape punishment even through death.

Seeing that and current offspring of socialism like NK, China, Venezuela I really have no confidence in seeing socialism implemented ""right. 

So I'd rather take my chances in taming beast of capitalism and implement socialistic ideas to create something ignoring bounds of all ideology."

96,"&gt;Not sure where you got your ""Europeans don't drink tap water regularly"" from. 

One of the purposes of quotation marks is to exactly reproduce the statements of another.  


I did not say  """"Europeans don't drink tap water regularly."" I said  they ""*often* do not drink tap water"" (and depending on the country in question, this is true). While I can see where you might be confused, these are not the same statements. It would have been just as easy for you to quote what I actually said and respond to that,  as it was to assume what I was saying and respond to an inaccurate paraphrase."

106,"I'm not sure. But I just wanted to clarify that it not seen in the similarly bad fashion as in the US. Yes, it is more harsh and I dont think anyone would pretty much call someone like that, but it is not taken so hard, that you would be kicked out of your job and almost put to prison (overexageration). But it is still pretty much an insult word but not seen as in US.

On the other hand, calling someone black or asian or white or latino or anything else is not seen as racist. No reason why it should be if that's who they are. Stereotyping is the same. Most stereotypes fits perfectly (otherwise those stereotypes would not exist in the first place) and not sure if anyone gets really upset by them for reals.

Also, people would laugh you up for getting upset over ""cultural appropriation"". That's just a normal human thing and people always liked many things from other nations. If anything else, it just shows your appreciation of other nations. 

But that's just going off-topic, sorry. (at least it applies for most of central europe.. I guess)"

109,"Not excusing his behavior, but there’s a long history there. Some of the older folks have a built up animosity towards people from the countries that dropped nukes on civilians, and they feel like those countries never answered for causing such huge atrocities. Same thing is the reason why many elderly Chinese have resentment towards Japan. I think that’s different than other racism based purely on color of one’s skin."

116,"Or maybe it's just because OP called him out on it. *I'm not defending the dude, he's still a total jerk.* Even so, I don't know what he thought, and neither do you, so you shouldn't say that he apologized to OP because he thought the girl was just prey. I prefer to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, even if I'm 99.99% sure that they're a scumbag."
