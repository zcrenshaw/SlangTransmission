"To answer this question it's important to first understand what suffering is.

Suffering is a reaction to and often experienced when confronted with harmful situations, physically, mentally and emotionally. The intensity of suffering is determined by the perception of harm or threat by the sufferer.

We can conclude from this that suffering is a subjective experience that is not the same for everyone, but it's still a universal experience.

The question ""Is suffering important?"" Is very hard to answer, because it depends on the intensity and the willingness of the sufferer to get through it. To put it another way; The importance of suffering depends on the way the suffering is dealt with and the outcome of the suffering.

Suffering itself is something negative, something nasty we like to avoid because it stems from painful situations, like loss of a loved one. However, we will inevitably have to deal with the negative aspects of life, and while we suffer we have to learn how to deal with that suffering. When you learn to deal with suffering you can find meaning in pain, or you can grow as a person and help others through their personal struggles. It can give you a perspective on life, and ultimately it can make you happier.

TLDR; Suffering can be a powerful tool if you find meaning in it and learn how to use it to your advantage. Unfortunately, it can also be your downfall if you fail to do so."

"It's so you don't have to worry about being overheard by said date. I mean there's always a chance they'll know what an Angela or other such safe word drink is, but it's a lot less likely that they'll catch it compared to, ""hey my date is scary and I need an out"" . 

If they hear their date saying stuff like they're uncomfortable, scared, or otherwise trying to get out of the date, they can become violent or cause a scene.

"Shortly after my now fiancé and I started dating, we went to the nearby Walmart to buy a half gallon of milk. I left him to checkout while I went to the bathroom. The bathrooms were on one end of the checkout lanes, and he checked out all the way on the other end. 

As I was walking back from the bathroom, he was walking towards me, so we were converging in the middle. While he was walking toward me, he was swinging the plastic bag with the jug of milk in wide circles perpendicular to the floor like a windmill. I was trying to tell him to stop, but of course he didn’t. 

Mid-swing, the bottom of the bag gave out. The jig soared through the air, at least 20 feet, in front of all of the checkout lanes. It hit the floor a few feet in front of me and just exploded. We both just stood there, me covered in milk, and then walked out of the store because we didn’t know what to do."

"So there are like 10,000 'Gods' out there. Yaweh, Allah, Zeus, Amaterasu, Shiva, et cetera. Thousands of them. You believe there to be only one, so you don't believe in 9,999 of them. I don't believe in just one more than you. Can you really claim that ""All 10,000 Gods are fake"" is a scam, when you're here claiming ""All 10,000 Gods are fake, except the one I like which is for sure real""?

Being smart is not a trait that redeems somebody from hate. 

He was also a fantastic public speaker. Doesn't make him admirable. He was allegedly very fond of and kind to his pets. Doesn't make him admirable. 

Ted Bundy was super charismatic. That doesn't mean he wasn't a killer. Genghis Khan inadvertently helped the climate and ecosystem. That doesn't mean he wasn't a mass rapist who lead a brutal military. Do you see what I'm getting at here? Your line of argument attempting to some way redeem Hitler is massively flawed."

"We all suffer at some point in time, and to varying degrees and lengths of time. I struggle with depression and a lot of anxiety, and I feel I suffer from those things at times. They have shaped me in ways I could never imagine. I don't worship those feelings, but I do recognize that they have changed me in good ways, and bad ways. 

I don't think suffering is 'important' or should be fetishized, it is merely something we encounter as humans. We should be ready for it, meditate on what it's given and taken after the fact, and support others who are suffering."

"since I am utterly devoted to ending all suffering (you know, the kind you always see on the news), I have to answer that question: Not necessarily. Suffering built me and my personality and my identity. But suffering breaks people. In my utopia, I allow struggle but not suffering. I follow a modified version of David Pearce's ""hedonistic imperative""; that human suffering ought to be eliminated. But not struggle; not the satisfaction you get of succeeding against an obstacle. Life will be utterly meaningless without struggle; video games are an example: once you have all the cheat codes, it's boring. You've won, now what? That's why I may allow struggle but not suffering. I know Divergent, The Giver, Harmful to Minors, Brave New World, Harrison Bergeron, and everything else related to human suffering (Edwin Shneidman, the Experience Machine, etc.)."

"This was my brother. He as a '9-11 was an inside job' theorist from soon after until well into last year.

I spent a year of my life studying militant Islam and it;s threat against the US and sent him all sort of information about them, the attacks in particular etc., he could not be swayed. 

He contacted me recently almost in tears, apologizing and ashamed of how stupid he was this whole time, how embarrassed he was about the whole thing, how stupid he felt, and that he finally got it. I asked him what finally changed his view and he said it was a documentary on cable.. about LAURA BUSH. He said that how she acted, reacted, and stepped up to the plate as first lady in the time after the attacks wasn't something that a first lady who would have known it was an inside job would have done."

Totalitarian means relating to a government where the ruler or ruling group has complete control.


The push to abolish the Electoral College by the Democrats is a move toward totalitarianism, therefore permanently taking ruling power over the countries citizens and removing any possibility of the minority regaining power. Total and permanent rule by Democrats.

The push by the Democrats for universal single payer healthcare by the government is a move toward totalitarianism. Right now government healthcare is an option for those who need it, however most people pay for their own health care through competing insurance companies. We are their customer, and our business allows us to pressure them into giving us what we want, else we go with a competitor. With a single payer system we are no longer customers, but slaves, with the government in complete control over all of our healthcare needs and options, and we get nothing unless it's approved by the ruler.

Other examples are those who rule through fear. Now both sides have done this, though the Democrats currently rule through fear. Thanks to the Electoral College they may not prosper, but they do. Many voters with conservative or centrist views remain silent due to the increasing attacks against open conservatives (I could write a novel on the attacks against me). 


Censorship of media is another example. This includes not only mainstream media, but social media as well. Mainstream media is censoring themselves by only providing partial facts and misrepresenting events, censoring the truth. The censorship is also rolling over to small independent media, where independent and small news reporters are being censored and silenced. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are heavily censored and getting worse, and they're censoring much more than the blatantly offensive attacks, they're censoring innocent people as well. 

Propaganda in media, government speeches and through education is another example. Once again propaganda exists on both sides as do speeches, however our educational system is ridiculously one sided in Democrats favor, enough so that students face academic retribution, threats, and segregation if they're open about their contrasting views, not to mention the physical attacks. 

Targeting of specific religious, political or racial populations is another example. In the Democrats case they're doing all three. Republicans can be see doing some of this, but not to the extent you see in the left. We've turned a complete 180 and are going back to racial segregation, and electing and placing people into positions of power based purely on skin color, and it's not the Republicans doing this. According to the Democrats you should feel ashamed to be white, Christian, heterosexual, or male, and God help you if you're all of the above. 

As for fascism, Democrats also fit this definition. It is defined as ""A fascist is a follower of a political philosophy characterized by authoritarian views and a strong central government — and no tolerance for opposing opinions."" Republicans believe in the rule of law, which is not authoritarian. Republicans also believe in ABSOLUTE MINIMUM government presence and interference. Democrats believe 
hat is the definition of fascism?

A fascist is a follower of a political philosophy characterized by authoritarian views and a strong central government — and no tolerance for opposing opinions. Republicans don't believe in a strong government presence, and in fact promote less government and less governmental interference. Democrats promote strong government and strong governmental control, over everything from what healthcare they believe you deserve, what vehicles they believe you should be allowed to drive, how you're allowed to defend yourself, to even whether or not you can collect rain water. Democrats want a strong government that will have full control over citizens every life aspect. 

As for not tolerating different viewpoints? Sharing that you're gay, Muslim, furry, or pansexual and you have nothing to worry about. Share that you believe in freedom of speech, that you want lower taxes, more personal responsibility, less government, or that you're simply conservative and you're looking at getting assaulted, harassed, threatened, egged, milkshaked, punched, targeted, demoted or expelled. Tolerating different viewpoints doesn't mean you have to accept them, or that you can't protest them, but it does mean not attacking people for them.

Fascism also relates to silencing voices you disagree with, such as censorship and overruling of the minority covered earlier in my post. You can control the people by silencing the opposition to achieve power, whether by assaulting them in the streets, deleting their ability to share their thoughts or speak with other people online, by editing out their voice, or by removing their right to representation. Democrats fit all of the above.

I forsee dozens of downvotes, but expect nothing less.

Either way I've spent entirely too much goddamn time on this explanation, but 12 cups of coffee and boredom can do that.

"Yeah, I can personally confirm that. My current job is stacking shelves in a supermarket late at night and otherwise making the shop ""Presentable"" for the next day. I mainly do cereals but I also do pet food.

Anyway, you always see cereals on some sort of promotion at the end of the aisle, and these promotions usually last a week or two and change on a Tuesday night/Wednesday... I was working overtime when the change occurred one week so I had to take the overstock that wasn't sold, move it back onto the regular shelves and put the new stuff out.

Well, the thing I also learned is that kids tend to be rather rough with the cereal boxes they get their hands on and can tear the boxes. Or the other staff. Or the delivery drivers.

Anyway, it wasn't the cereal box that was damaged, it was the whole delivery container that was torn in it's corner (they are usually made so that you can tear some flaps off and instantly put out a whole set of boxes at once) and was at the very back of the shelf with the tear catching on the end where we slide the shelves in. I just couldn't pull it out with one arm so I reached in with both arms, ready to lean in and tear the box free.

Luckily I already cleared the shelf so I didn't damage anything, but I swear I gave my shift manager a heart attack when she heard a massive crashing noise from the shelf falling all the way down to the ground."

Also it sounds like you have only read the kids version of the bible, it is actually a very complex and hard to understand book. Im going to include a small quote from the book Ecclesiastes you tell me if it i Simple:

4 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.

3 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

4 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.

7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

8 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail."

We ended up standing in the area waiting for the concert to begin when a group of drunk guys start harassing the woman, eventually it got to a point where it was sexual harassment and me and my friend stepped in telling the guys to fuck off. Closer to the concert actually beginning this random guy comes up to us with the girl we helped out and said ""hey guys thanks for protecting my wife it means a lot to me want to do some acid"". Now we weren't idiots and we knew dudes gave out harmful drugs at concerts all the time so we asked him to do some with us. Popped them and proceeded to have the best night of my fucking life."

"I think it’s easier for people to follow what many others they associate with to be true (“We both think similarly on these issues so it must apply to the rest as well”), and it’s easier to go with the majority because we are usually inclined to think a majority opinion on something is correct (“All of these people think about it this way so maybe I should too”), it’s easier for people to tie themselves to a large group than to be out “alone” on topics or to butt heads with a large group in disagreement"

"It happened to me when I was still in kindergarten, but I think it doesn’t matter.

 And so, I am 5 years old, and we have lunch.

 I think it's worth saying that in our kindergartens there is a clear daily routine.

For example: Games - Lunch - Sleep - Games, after that parents took us.

But, you know, I didn’t really like to eat in kindergartens, because food were prepared, to put it mildly, not very tasty. No, well, imagine a fat carrot cutlet that also stinks! FU!

But especially I did not like pea soup, or rather the soup that the cook prepared. He was muddy, thick and nasty!

Well, obviously then I just didn’t want to eat and pushed back the plate.

And you know what? Apparently, that nanny was not in a very good mood then. When I said that I didn’t want to eat, **she took me by the hair and just hit her face in the soup**!

"I was making a video about how to get a free starbucks drink. You basically can give any reason and request a new one, and they are supposed to oblige.

The women working there really didn't appreciate this and *really* didn't appreciate me filming and not making eye contact, but were obligated to comply and be friendly about it. Once I got the drink, I went for a quick victory chug but forgot it was a frappucino and gave myself brain freeze, causing me to spill it all over the floor and my shirt.

"When I was a kid, my friend and I got kicked out of a Bank of America branch. I never went back.

My mom was doing something at the counter with the teller, so we walked off and found an elevator. The building was three stories, and I believe it had the bank on the first floor, some bank administration on the second and third floors, and other offices in there as well.

We got the bright idea to ride the elevator up and down, and JUMP as we traveled up and down to compare air time, as kids do. Apparently, when the elevator is going down, it feels like you're in the air a little longer! Physics is fun.

What we didn't realize, however, was the amount of NOISE our experiments were causing. Someone called the building security, who followed us in the other elevator up and down a few times. We realized something was up and tried to hide behind some plants, but Columbo found us. 

We were escorted out of the building, and my mom was pissed for some reason."

"I don't think any individual person has the financial resources to end world hunger. It is not like Jeff bezos opens his banking app on his phone and sees a balance of $130,000,000,000. That's not how it works. The vast majority of his wealth (like &gt;95%) is in Amazon stock. Stock which he cannot sell just at the drop of a hat. Since he is the largest shareholder and the CEO, he has to do paperwork and other stuff, to ensure there is no insider trading going on. The next largest portion of his wealth is in real estate, after that is companies he personally owns (think blue origin and the Washington post), then finally depreciating assets like his cars and whatnot.  When it comes to actual cash he could pull out of a bank right now, while we don't know the exact amount, going off of his fellow richest people on earth, we can assume it is probably under $100million, or less than 0.1% of his wealth. Though it is probably less than $50 million given that he doesn't have many expensive tastes (think jewelry, sports teams, yachts, etc.)  Most of those accounts are probably frozen tbh so he doesn't have to worry about the money being stolen and doesn't have to check every bank account he has every day."

"As a fit person who later became fat, I can say that any significant fat increase is literally a weight on the body. It is worse than wearing a weighted vest. It feels really weird as well, if you aren't used to it. It was only for about 1.5 years (gained weight after a major life change, and then realized later than I should have what had happened, and cut back). 

Now, people think of ""fat"" as being obese, but one can be quite fat and still look good. It is still extra weight. A reasonably framed person with some muscle mass can probably hand 20-50 extra lbs and still look ""good"". But it is still that much extra weight on the body all the time and on all the joints.

I can only imagine what obese people or people who grew up fat are like. Besides messing up the endocrine system, the sheer weight on the joints and connective tissue is massive. 

People will say not to go rucking (hiking with a backpack with weights in it) with over 50 lbs (or 35 lbs), because it is risky. 

I think as the population gets used to fat being normal (it already is), and people grow up fat, people may not realize how deficient their state is. 

Forgetting sexual attraction and social factors. It is the weight on one's body and the impact such amounts of adipose tissues have on the endocrine system. Then the impact on cancer and other diseases. But the weight alone is a reason not to be fat. 

&gt; Only ego and thick skin prevents fat people from seeing reason.

I think ignorance and hopelessness also factors in."

Although as a side note, it's apparently expiring in 2050 and I knew this would happen because the government wiped the ""Social Security"" account long ago and we're trillions in debt so... Current old people/disabled are receiving it, but I will not. It makes me mad 20% of my paycheck still goes towards it though."
"My wife is a 38G and often has to run with BOTH arms on her chest like she's getting ready to box. I often compare it to the absolute pain I feel in my obese gut when I run or jump. It hurts, so I can imagine a similar pain from two large bouncy boobs."

As far as the episode... I found it jarring and unsettling but I do appreciate the way it shook House. He couldn't find a single clue or reason it happened and there wasn't some final test or missing journal page that was going to give him closure (or at least make it make sense).  
  
Dr. House is far smarter than us but in this episode I think us viewers as well as House were in the same shitty spiral hoping we'd figure out how something so awful happened (and maybe avoid it in our own lives :/ )."

"I'm hesitant to skim the comments since I'm in the community. It feels like things are trying to get better, but end up falling back. The representation we get in the media is pretty shitty and it feels like it's rarely positive, and my paranoia leads me to worry that cisgender (or non-transgender people) will see these negative stereotypes as a way to demonize me or ""clock me"".

It really, really sucks. Thankfully there are good people in the community and allies fighting to create a safer world for us, but I don't know when that day is going to come when I can sleep soundly at night knowing everything is okay - especially when tensions are high in the community when people antagonize each other, sort of like the gay community having a problem with internalized homophobia (the no fats, no fems thing). 

As a trans man, it can be like going into a mine field because you never know if you're going to find a potential friend or someone who will call you a pussy or tell you that you aren't a real man if you aren't a hypermasculine dudebro who loves beer and going to the gym."

"Ok I think as a straight female I can answer this. 

1.) Come talk to us.

Contrary to popular belief, many of us are oblivious and stupid. We have no idea if you like us if you never talk to us. Some of us are insecure and couldn’t imagine someone liking us. Just talk to us, we don’t bite. And if she does bite, you dodged a bullet. 

Although there’s a few rules to this. I would suggest not

- talking about anything disgusting like bodily fluids, sex jokes, dick jokes. Now some of us don’t mind, but (more likely than not) you’ll be automatically categorized as a friend. 
- coming in with a pick-up line. This usually gives off f-boy / dick vibes. We’re going to assume we’re not the first girl you used that on, therefore we think you’re more interested in getting vagina than us. 

Besides that it’s pretty open. You can ask about the weather, work / school, ask us a question about the t-shirt we’re waiting... I dunno. Just be respectful. Use your common sense. Tits &amp; ass aren’t great conversation starters, just saying. 

Who knows, perhaps that girl you’re interested in is just waiting for you to make a move. Because, hell, who wants to make the first move? 

But you won’t know unless you try. Good luck my dudes. Feel free to ask any questions if you’re curious."

Is it worth the violence it would take to elicit that response from a drunk guy, the physical risk to myself and the girl, the legal ramifications of successfully beating the shit out of someone, and the potential to ruin his life with an injury or medical bills over a drunken mistake? Probably not.

What about just ignoring him? - bruised ego, *maybe*...and that's it."

You are 100 percent correct, nobody gets a pass on assaulting people just because they're a woman. My own mother was a mean drunk and she'd go after my Dad. I had to watch her hauled off by the police too many times as a kid after she started hitting him. Mind he was twice the size of her and a rough neck, if he'd given her left's to her ""equal rights"" she'd have gone to the ER, not jail.

"I was too controlling. We were in high school and he was my first love and I cared about him so much I just wanted the best for him and I tried to force him to make better choices. I didn’t want him selling weed bc I was afraid he’d get in trouble. I didn’t take into account how poor he was and pulled the “if you REALLY loved me you’d stop!” We were 14 and 15. It’s not like he could have gotten a real job, too young and no transportation. I didn’t have some moral issue with it - I smoked pot I just didn’t want him to get in trouble &amp; I refused to respect his choice to take the risk to do it to have a little spending money. It’s not like he was some kingpin, just a sweet broke punk rock kid whose mom couldn’t even afford to get him braces, who just wanted money to buy a few records and go to a few shows. So yeah, I learned the hard way that if you really love someone don’t try to control them or you can and probably should lose them. Try to influence OK, discuss absolutely, but try to FORCE someone to behave a certain way? No. That’s an unhealthy relationship. I was wrong and it was a hard, painful lesson to learn. Either accept them as they are or don’t be with them. Those are the choices you get."

"I'm going to put an answer in her with reasoning. First of all lets put out the heart and sphincter in the nature of a good answer. 

I believe it would have to be the genio glossus or one of the surrounding muscles since it would degrade your quality of life severely. The reason for this being that you would loose function of your tongue. This would do the most damage to most peoples daily life but even more than someone who was a mute. This is because if you loose control of your tongue you are not going to be able to chew, not only that but you are going to have serious difficulty swallowing. To add to that you will probably have extreme difficulty forming vowels and consonants meaning you probably wont be able to talk. So you are unable to eat and chew, swallow and talk. The other issue you would certainly face is the issue of having your tongue block your throat when you sleep or even when you move in certain ways making it difficult to breathe.

Ultimately you would struggle to chew, eat, swallow, drink, talk, breathe and probably taste."

The hardest part about that was finding someone with the same mindset, i had to finish two good relationship because both of my ex decided after some years that they wanted children in the end, but i still didn't (and i made that VERY clear at the start of our relationships). Now for 3 years i'm with my fiancée who is 31 years old, i'm sure she won't change her mind, i love her and we are perfectly happy, maybe we'll be all alone one day, but honnestly when i see how people only call their mother/father once every two weeks just to not be too guilty of not taking proper care of their parents, having a child doesn't mean that you won't be lonely.

This kid has a little bit of mental issues so it kinda justifies it but damn I feel bad. So some kid comes up to said kid and land sharks him, and gets a good laugh.
