7,"Yes? But mine, that I was talking about in my comment, had an alarm. That would have made a lot of noise over raw eggs on the burner.

31,"And, from a modern perspective, it is true that circumcised individuals are less likely to pass on STDs to partners (not NEVER, just less than non-circumcised) and the link between multiple cancers and HPV has been established for several decades. 

So, while I'm in no way defending the practice, I'm a vehement opponent of it in fact, while they were misguided, they weren't exactly wrong."
32,why not both? jump in front of a train
33,Blow it out your ass.
34,"First off, that‚Äôs incredibly hypocritical of you to say, as someone who apparently doesn‚Äôt tolerate it, for the most vile, life stealing crimes, but is ok with someone who comments on Reddit. Second off, you‚Äôre going to tell me right now that someone who rapes multiple people and kills and/or mutilates someone doesn‚Äôt deserve getting the shit kicked and beat out of them but instead 3 hots and a cot for life, then you‚Äôre insane"
35,Well yours is a special case. If you emancipated yourself from them and represented yourself as independent you could've gotten better benefits. But for the majority it's good enough. Unless you are attending a good UC

52,Don‚Äôt pin that abomination on the whole state.
53,"If we're talking about the USA, it's more like you have a party on the moderate right, and a party on the far right."
54,I understand why people don't want kids and I don't disagree with them. I just think people seem to be overly annoyed at people who ask them about it. The responses don't seem proportional. I mean if they are asking constantly or they have a snarky tone of voice it's understandable if you get pissy. But if it's just a one off or very infrequently and they aren't trying to be mean I think all this anger seems unjustified. Then again I've never dealt with people asking about me having kids so maybe I'll change my tune when they start asking.

57,"If you want to request sex, hire a prostitute. If you want sex from your partner you‚Äôve gotta have chemistry. That starts all the way with how you greet each other, to spending quality time together, to flirting and then someone has to take initiative. You gotta know how to read your partners cues and what they desire and act accordingly. 

The absolute best way to not have sex is to ask ‚Äúhey do you wanna have sex?‚Äù"

63,Do you even know what FGM is?
64,"What a *waste* of life putting 5000 hours into a video game is.  

5000 hours ... that's over 2 years of full-time employment

You could have learned several languages, earned a degree, built a sailboat from scratch, or walked across every continent in that time.

I sincerely hope nobody answers this question seriously having spent 5000 hours on a game."
65,The UK office was terrible. I can't believe they wanted to do an American version but it was amazing. Best cold opens in history.
66,If you visit BuzzFeed it could be a symptom of severe autism. Also you could get a cancer if you visit it so its better to go right to de doctor as soon as posible.
67,"I get that. I've seen spongebob and they didnt have a lot of toilet humour, but it had way to much stupid humour for me. I've seen a few episodes and I couldn't get into it."

71,Lmao your a virgin loser ü§£
72,Your talking to cops. They dont care about anyone's safety but their own. It's even been ruled that they dont actually have to protect us if they dont want to.
73,I wouldn't call him a comedian. He can do one character.
74,"I mentioned Freud because just about everything he ever ""proved"" has been debunked. You're not providing sources because there are none, and in an attempt to cover yourself you're claiming a moral high ground. You have no facts to back you up, and no peer-reviewed studies. You're offended because you wanted to be."
75,Keep in mind though that medical schools and their assessments are monitored by the GMC (general medical council) so even the person who barely passes his exams is still good enough to be a doctor. Basically the worst of the best
76,Earth
77,You keep using this word 'functionally' . . . I don't think you know what it means.
78,Whatever you say.

80,"My friend used to use tinder alot. He met this girl and started talking for a while. Not a month in, the girl asked him to meet up. He was suspicious and decided to agree but brought me with him. He would come late and I would go to the meet up place first so that I can see who it is. If it was a pretty girl, I'm calling him. If not, he's ditching. Note that I have not seen what the girl looks like. All he said was she was gonna wear a pink dress.

I hid behind a bush waiting for them, when suddenly, the creepy girl from the class next to us came out, wearing a pink dress. She was really pretty, not gonna lie. But she was hella creepy af. She would stalk people, steal things from her crush, and even brought a knife to school because someone kissed her crush. 

Told him to ditch. He asked why and I told her it was the creepy girl from the other class. He deleted tinder after that."
81,"It really isn't, people aren't going to give up meat, myself included. Though lab grown meat will probably take over."
82,88
83,"I highly doubt that the majority are. Problem is that the US is as big as Europe, so you get your bad apples broadcast to everyone.

Are your cops worse than in Germany? Yeah, but some of it is down to audience. And a good bunch is up to that very many people have guns in the US. Here no one has guns.

Another part probably is how you become a cop. I heard yours have a very short acedemy? My brother became a cop, but he had to study 3 years for it."
84,Right dude. Maybe you idiots should just grow up. Just because there isn't a serious tag doesn't mean you have to post autistic troll shit every fucking thread. It's not even funny. Making a joke about his uncle abusing. Such humor /s
85,I'd honestly say a majority of poverty in first world countries is self inflicted.  They are too stupid to know why they are poor.

108,She was the matriarch of the family though so it doesn't make sense that she would have ever enforced the no music rule. Plus how believable b is it that she had never even casually heard the most popular song in the world.
109,I think as a passenger I would enjoy it if they all got up at exactly the same time. Sang their hearts out for ONE (1) SHORT (&lt;3 minute) song.  And immediately sat down without a word
110,"What part of texas? I've lived in Texas, most of my life and the only [one] time I have seen it happen was being my friends dad got pissed off at black people who cut him off entirely and ultimately prevented us from getting into six flags and they even had the nerve to flip him off! My friends dad is a dual leg amputee and has a bad temper! He was slow pissed he let a racial slur slip out [we were in middle school at the time!] I'm almost 24 now and have not seen that batty shit in SUCH a long time.."
