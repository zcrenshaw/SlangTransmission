0,"It's stuff like this that proves all the people who say rich people just got lucky, etc. wrong. There have been countless people who got rich in a day off the lottery and all they had to do was just stuff that shit in the bank or state-guaranteed bonds or whatever while they educated themselves on stocks, having all the time in the world to learn seeing as they could quit their jobs. Yet instead they blew it all. 

Rich people are rich because they're stingy as shit. Poor people don't seem like big spenders because they never get the chance, but give them a couple million dollars off the Lotto and they'll burn through it. "

This is called wage theft.  Document *every time* you are required to stay late.  Get a calendar app on your phone and mark down exactly when you begin work and leave work, every day.  Verify, with recordings of the conversation (or, written instructions) that you are being required to stay late.

When you are fired for following directions (if they don't require you to stay late) or when you are not paid for the time you worked (if they DO require you to do so), you will (likely) be entitled to that compensation.  Lawsuits happen over this.  Companies go bankrupt over this.  Wage theft is not a small issue and should never be put up with."

35,"In school we had very strict uniform rules, years 7-9 had a different tie (there was 3 designs and it rotated) but they all had stripes. You had to have exactly 6 stripes on your tie, and no fat knots. People would deliberately have fat knots and 6 stripes or nice sized knots with 7 stripes, it drove one teacher crazy. In years 10 &amp; 11 they had a plain tie with a logo on the end of it and the rule was the logo had to be showing, after not being able to call people up for ‘fat ties’ because the logo was still showing, they eventually had to change it. Pretty much every rule they placed backfired."
36,"As far as restaurant scheduling goes, the bulk of time that goes into it is deciding who to put where; even if availability s already factored into the program you use to schedule, there are still too many variables regarding individual worker’s skill, how they get along with each other (restaurants are typically rife with drama), whether or not some needs training or is getting their hours cut, to really automate it. Personally, I’m not a fan of even copy-pasting schedules from week-to-week when these aren’t major factors, as it typically keeps workers from working varied types of shifts and is easily tripped up when someone needs a specific day off (this just got me this last week when I needed Sunday off, though I’m not the one writ8ng schedules).

For a staff of 12-20 people, it usually took me about an hour to write a schedule (less if things fell into place and it was a copy of the previous week). Then again, my schedules always needed review by someone above me, and I push to get them posted by Thursday day ( I have horror stories about Kate schedules)."
37,"A group of us were out drinking, we were sitting in a booth and my friend had to get up to pee. People on one end of the booth started moving because my friend was in the middle. He was super drunk and started apologizing to everyone for making them move for him. When he came back, he decided to make up for it by attempting to slide over top of the table and gracefully go back into his seat. The table that had glasses full of drinks, plates of food and all that stuff and he slid right through it, knocking it all on the floor. The worst/best part was he misjudged his slide and went head first into his seat and was kind of stuck there flailing his legs. All this happened in the span of a couple seconds. It got us kicked out but not before we left a large tip. We took our friend home and made him promise to handle his liquor better in the future."

Growing up, I never left my clothes in the bathroom. That's just not where they go, so I didn't do it. But lately my wife has been yelling at me for leaving my towels and clothes in the bathroom. Why am I doing it?

I figured it out. About ten years ago I moved into a house with a large enough bathroom to keep a laundry basket in it. So I'd undress for the shower, throw clothes in the laundry basket, then shower, dry off, throw the towel in the basket.

The three houses that followed all had the same - laundry basket in the bathroom.

But we sold my house and moved into my wife's, and these bathrooms aren't as large.

It takes [right around 1 kilojoule to heat 1 kg of air 1 deg C.](https://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/thermo/property_tables/air/air_cp_cv.html)

There are [by estimate 5.15 x 10^18 kg of air in our atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth)

Which means it would take 5.15 x 10^21 J of energy to heat the atmosphere by 1 K.

The asteroid that ended the dinosaurs is estimated to be right around 100x that much energy, which admittedly would do the trick by heating the air 100K which would put it above boiling. But you have to remember, if--IF we were to blow an asteroid to smithereens (which...is the actual problem in the first place since nukes won't work nearly as well outside of an atmosphere) only a tiny fraction would actually hit the planet.

It wouldn't heat the entire atmosphere, at least not quickly. Worst case scenario is you have really, REALLY high winds for a few days and then as equilibrium sets in, some pretty epic fucking storms, but the biosphere is probably mostly unharmed.

And why? Well, because most of the meteorites burn up in the highest parts of the atmosphere. The parts that don't really trap heat that well, and because greenhouse gases aren't really that high up, they radiate it back up to space fairly quickly. You really only worry about the parts of the asteroid that make it into the troposphere, where the greenhouse gases can actually trap the heat of the ""impact"".

Really the best thing you can do if you don't have a laser that can create a jet of rock to slow an asteroid down is to hit it repeatedly with nukes until you slow it down enough that it won't hit you in the first place."

141,"I was going to lunch with my best friend and his younger brother, who was going through a rough time and was staying in a mental care facility. Since visiting hours where we could pick him up and go somewhere were limited, I felt a responsibility to take him to a place with a welcoming atmosphere so we could have a pleasant, enjoyable time and/or get into deep positive conversation. The goal was to raise his spirits and get his hopes up again (especially since the staff at the care facility had a few questionable ideas about what was best for the healing process... but I digress).

We go to the first place we come across, a casual American diner. It looks fine, and not at all busy. Great, this will work. We walk past a “please seat yourself” sign, and the middle-aged waitress tells us to sit wherever we like. At this point I realize we’re a bit out of place, two 30-year olds and a guy in his mid 20s walking into a restaurant that’s currently only serving people decades older than us, but that’s OK. I’m friends with a bunch of people in their 60s or 70s so I don’t feel uncomfortable.

We look for a booth and decide to head to the back, away from the occupied tables. As we approach a spot that looks optimal for conversation, we hear “And just where do you think you’re going?!”

We turn around to see our waitress, glaring at us with a suspicious, fiery sneer. “Oh, is this section not currently open?” I ask.

“You can sit here,” she says while gesturing to the booths next to us, “but you can’t sit *there*!” She is pointing at a large booth and table for big groups at the very back. It’s another 10 feet from where we currently are.

My adrenaline surges. It’s one thing to be treated that way and be pre-emptively accused of some minor infraction, but now I’m thinking that our chance of enjoying a meal at a friendly, mental-health-improving establishment is pretty much toast. 

She leaves for the kitchen, and I’m just thinking “what the fuck.” My inner mama bear is roaring at me to come out. I turn to my friends and ask if they want to go, and after a moment’s hesitation we all determine that yes, we all do.

We got up and passed the waitress as she was heading back toward us with menus. One of my friends told her we were actually heading out, and she looked confused and irritated. So I told her that what she did wasn’t cool, we weren’t even going to sit there, bye.

So I guess I didn’t actually “lose my shit” that time, at least not on the outside. But I *always* aim to be kind, patient, and a good tipper to service staff (personal life rule after too many embarrassing restaurant experiences with an older relative), so me telling a server that I didn’t like what they did and walking out is pretty extreme, comparatively.

We found another American restaurant 10 minutes away that had the best food I’d eaten in ages, with the friendliest server we could ask for and had a great time."

162,No that is not the protocol at all. In all active shooter situations schools want kids to lock the doors turn off the lights and sit quietly in a corner of the room where view is obstructed. This is so when the police get there  they don't have kids all running down halls &amp; shit.

Initially they thought lymphoma because there was a 9 inch wide tumour in my chest but after a lymph node biopsy they changed the diagnosis to leukaemia.

I literally just googled it and found a few articles. [here is one](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7962960/Man-unaware-he-had-been-shot-in-head-five-years-ago.html). [here is another one.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2030646/Man-survives-bullet-brain-30-YEARS-wife-shot-gun-bought-gift.html) granted these are both media rags, however I don't think they'd just make up lies. they tend to just embellish instead of fabricating entire stories. I'm too lazy to fact-check but I know that it is entirely possible to be shot in the head and live, if only for a few hours. these are extreme cases. 

people have been impaled through their eye, through the brain and out the back of their skull and lived. you're actually more likely to survive an impaling than a bullet wound. just don't take whatever's in you out. you'll probably die. I've personally opened up a cadaver that had a bullet go between the lungs, punctured the pericardium, grazed the heart, missed the spinal cord by a few millimeters and went out their back. one in a million angle. big zipper scar down his chest where they went in and repaired the damage. he died 30 years later of diabetes-related complications. we had the coroner's report and then the body was turned over to the medical school cause that was just so damn lucky that he survived that. 

The human condition is incredible. every day I'm amazed that a perfectly healthy athlete can drop dead at 23 from a/n LAD blockage heart attack (""the widow-maker"") and I've opened up 85 year old men who've smoked a pack a day for 60 years and were killed in a car accident.

223,"Maybe I didn’t make myself clearer. While my college is more liberal than my hometown, it was more of a result of its policies on making a safe space. Free speech still exists. Active debate is encouraged. Conservative views are accepted along with liberal. The key point is to prevent any extremism or hatred from becoming too violent or physical. In my college, you have the right to talk about your conservative beliefs just as much as you have the right to talk about liberal beliefs.

Their goal is to make a space to encourage you to be your proper self. Their goal isn’t to make a space where you won’t be challenged. It’s a space where if you are challenged, you can be done so and reacted to safely physically.

There is no “liberal indoctrination.” Everything is the consequence of the above fact. There are many active religious communities and while I myself do not participate in them, I see them doing their stuff at various club fairs and their outdoor meetings and boy do they have their number of followers. Nobody’s being forced to a certain ideology. Any ideology they come up with happens from their reconciliation with their past and their current situation.

If your college is forcing or encouraging you to adhere to liberal perspectives despite your conservative perspectives. And I’m talking even slight forcing that is continuous, not offhand once in a while comments, then you should talk to the superintendent about that. No voice should be silenced.

Even if you’re a Nazist, of which I don’t know whether you are or not, you have the right to free speech. You don’t have the right to not be challenged in your beliefs. But if you are silenced, there’a the problem. But if other people aren’t listening to you, that’s not the Constitution’s problem.

So frankly, if you see a problem, do something about it instead of complaining. Make a peaceful rally. Free speech only works if all of us use it. It’s the factor that makes the Constitution so great and allows mankind to advance further in its philosophy. If some part of your philosophy doesn’t make it into mankind’s philosophy, I’m sorry. But with free speech, you can be certain that some part of it will make it."

I love alien stories. And this documentary had me hooked until the videos of the ""peeping tom"", the supposed ""photo evidence"" of his daughter in the yard and the phone calls were shown. What a bummer. great hoax, but he took it too far.

*Spoiler alert: the last thing does strike to me as kind off interesting to say the least. This guy, not very good with computers. Was found guilty with 500TB of child pornography on his computer after an ""anonymous tip"" tipped of the police exactly where to look in his pc.

Now this is where I think it gets interesting. Do you reckon this idiot actually put the cp on his pc, called the anonymous tip himself, only to claim he was framed by government hackers?

Is he really a pedophile?

Or did someone really want to silence him?

This entire story intrigues me more than his whole bullshit alien story...

EDIT: Not 500tb (was the victim of some fake news stories) of cp; it was actually about 300 images and videos. I think this points more to him being a pedophile instead of being framed."

Now, we were spending the weekend on a very nice docked boat, so we were surrounded by water. Anyway, after we finished eating we went out to a park to stargaze (a huge meteor shower was happening that weekend). All of a sudden, it felt like I chugged blended uranium, it was such a horrible feeling. So we got into the truck and got the fuck outta there. Halfway back to the boat, the stomach pain doubled and I just had to go. We ended up pulling into the parking lot of an outside Italian place and I sprinted to the bathrooms in the back. Unfortunately, the male bathroom was full, but the woman's wasn't (these were those little one toilet bathrooms). I spent fifteen minutes in there, until I heard a female voice complain ""well no one can go because the bathroom is being hogged"" and a wave of fear washed over me. I decided I had two options, I could either wait for my bowels to finish their course and face the inevitable crowd of women surrounding the door, or I could finish prematurely and hope nobody was outside. I chose the latter. Luckily, nobody was there to witness this poor man's food poisoning in action. I hustled back to the truck and we continued our horrible quest back to the boat. Somehow we made it without me losing my lunch (actually dinner but lunch is more used), and I finally relaxed on the couch in the boat. It was all going good until my stomach suddenly decided I just had to hurl. So I got up, walked onto the dock and waited. Also, it had just turned 12:06 AM, marking the beginning of my birthday. Vomit suddenly flew out of my mouth at the speed of light, all into the water. I pleaded with God that it would all be ok afterwards. And it was, but only after I puked seven more times.

252,"I’ve had a recurring dream about a sand pit (I know sounds weird) the first time I clearly remember the dream was when I was 3. The first few dreams were from the perspective of a person inside this pit or room, the sand is somehow controlled and starts to accumulate as it rolls like how a snowball rolling downhill does. It would start at one side of the pit and roll and get bigger and bigger and bounce off walls. Everyone stuck inside this sand pit would scream and try and dodge the ball of sand but one by one they would be crushed under hundreds of pounds of sand hitting them at the speed of a vehicle. only to be brought back to life and repeat this regularly.

Then as an adult I dreamt from the viewpoint of a spectator looking down at the pit, lights shined downwards that blinded the people from seeing the people above them watching.

Not entirely sure, we went to bed late as my legs were hurting a lot so we stayed up till like 4 am watching bake off. Shut down, we all went to bed, we hadn't even curled up to sleep yet, still pottering on our phones and this huge log BANG WHOOSH CRASH came out of nowhere. I thought our shed had collapsed where the rabbits were so I lept up and stuck my head out of the window. Nothing, all fine, then the fire alarm started up. Our cat sleeps in the kitchen..

For clarification, I use a wheelchair but I can walk slowly for short periods and it hurts, at this point I chuckle myself off the bed, the living room door was collapsed out in the hall towards the bedroom (it's a bungalow), I kept over that door, one of our fish tanks was shattered which I just ran over into the kitchen where the cooker was sort of collapsed in and on fire and a goodly portion of the ceiling was on the floor. The back door was at the other end of the garden, the walls were bowed out slightly. I put the fire out with a sauce pan Barking orders at hubs whilst our wifey, the non disabled one couldn't get over the door so called 999.

They kept telling her to get me to leave. Which was not happening. I was focused on searching and fire fighting. My cat might have been hurt. I got the fire out just in time for a fireman to stick his head through the window. I help up my saucepan at which point my legs completely gave out and I had to be half carry dragged out to the front garden and popped into my wheelchair. Which only had 1 foot rest. As they left 1 in the hall lol.

Wet to hospital, all fine, tons of cuts of legs though. After we went the building where the council people are and I'd turned a hospital blanket into a skirt as I was still wearing my bed shorts... None of us had shoes. We looked a right sight! We got some red Cross clothes and a bag of food a d sent to a temporary flat where they forgot to turn on the gas and had no hot water for 3 days xD. 

In the next 7 weeks we eventually found a Foster home for the rabbit so we could get her off the active site. 4 weeks later we got our cat back. Thor must have circled and was back in the house straight away but he refused to go near the builders and we were not allowed within 10 feet of the house. He was singed, his whiskers melted like plastic but bounded out of the cage and head butted me before promptly tackling Loki, our dog. The last pet we got out finally at the 7.5 week mark was Integra, our corn snake. They kept sending 1 person to get her our and stuff. When they did it properly they forced us to sign a waiver saying it was our fault if she passed away and they got to keep the body to send to the rspca! But seeing as they lost her keys in the first few days, that was not happening. She was fine, and has bounced back well.

That's the short version of all the random crap to have happened xD.

I don't know why people think women with comically huge asses are attractive. I'm not talking about ""thicc"" women, but rather skinny women who have artificially inflated their ass with surgical procedures to make them comically huge. I'm speaking directly, of course, about celebrities like [Kim Kardashian](https://www.t-nation.com/system/publishing/articles/10005263/original/The-Kardashian-Butt-Must-Die.jpg?1503947599), [Kylie Jenner](https://i.redd.it/day1nqie7ulz.jpg), [Nicki Minaj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/nicki+back.jpg), et al.

These women are extremely wealthy, and they have the money to get any sort of plastic surgery or body shaping that they want, and they choose to pay thousands of dollars for asses that are so over-the-top oversized fake it's ridiculous. They honestly look like the asses you'd find on a 400lb woman. Just huge, fat, cottage cheese inflated asses.

And what is more ridiculous to me is that these women are considered the pinnacle of beauty. Kylie Jenner is basically considered one of the most beautiful women in the world *and* she's a billionaire now because of her beauty. It makes me feel like I'm in some sort of Twilight Zone world where I'm the only one who sees this.

It reminds me of the 90s where some women would get like quadruple H sized breasts that were so fucking huge they were like an over exaggerated cartoon character. These women were not seen as attractive but instead seen more like sideshow acts or for people with a weird fetish. I think the same way about those celebrities today with the comically huge fat obese asses but no one seems to agree.

This is also similarly related to those huge fake upper lip plastic surgeries that women get these days that also look horrifying."

I was just planning on showing her how to move her arms and hips, but she said that i should get behind her and show her how it's really done because she didn't understand me. After a few seconds, my dick was getting bigger and it was rubbing against her ass. She was teasing me so hard, moving up and down, even some circular motion. I was trying so hard to not get a full boner but she was making it difficult. She stomped my foot (i still think it was to kill my boner) and then said she thinked she had it. 

I told the group that i'd go and get something from my car, i went to my car and started going at it. I can go for quite a while so after a few minutes  (3 or 4), the girl scared the shit out of me when she knocked on the window, after knocking she opened the door and told me she wouldn't touch it that day, but would let me watch her. I came all over her shorts (i knew she brought a jacket so she could just tie it around her waist to hide it) and then we headed back to the group.

Whenever we were with my family, he was the most loving guy - saying how wonderful I am and how lucky he is to have me, holding my hand, rubbing my back, etc. The second we were alone, everything changed. He'd convince me that I had said things I hadn't said, or that I broke something that he had broken, or even something as simple as saying that I drank all the milk (I'm allergic to milk, so no, I didn't drink your damn milk). One night, I was sitting on the couch, watching TV in the living room - he came out of the bedroom and said ""so who is he?!"" I had no idea what he was talking about. Then he proceeded to try and convince me that I was cheating on him with someone. I sat there, wracking my brains, trying to figure out with whom I was having an affair. I tried to come up with an answer because if he said it was true, it had to be true. That's how far it had gone and I didn't even realize it for another 2 years.

The day I kicked him out was one of the best days of my life (I think the best was when I actually got my divorce certificate in the mail :D). The weight was lifted. I felt free and happy!

483,"I went on a gay double date.

This was back in the “don’t ask, don’t tell” days of the military. I was stationed with a friend I’d gone through basic training with. He was coming to grips with his own sexuality, and he’d scored a date with a guy. His date pulled the “you need to bring somebody for my friend” bit.

By telling me, he was taking a huge, career-destroying risk. I agreed to come along.

We went out to dinner, then back to his place. We watched some gay porn, cuddled, and my “date” and I excused ourselves at the right moment.

Dude was smooth. If I had even a hint of bisexuality in me, I would have discovered it there. Unfortunately, I guess I don’t. He understood, told me I was a good friend, and we parted ways.

My friend is now married to a combat helicopter pilot, and was the best man at my wedding. He’s out, proud, and happy.

527,"Buffalo, NY here. It has gotten a lot better. City was in pretty bad shape, while I was a teenager / going to college. Downtown a ghost town after 5pm. Job prospects slim to none, people just feeling downtrodden by industry leaving from our boom in 60's. I used to joke our #1 export was people, as everybody who had ambitions to do something in there life planned on getting out. 

I even did myself going to Vegas from 2005- 2011. While I was gone things slowly started to change. First we started to see some development of our water front. More and more downtown historic buildings started getting renovated to modern apartments. Young professionals wanted to move to the city and be by night life and such, a strong reversal of white flight to the suburbs that we saw in previous 30 years or so. With that some tech industry started to come in a bit more, more development, new retail, restaurants, and other amenties started coming in more. A new medical campus gets built downtown. More water front development happens. Word gets out that our housing is super cheap compared to the rest of the country. So we start seeing some gentrification in some areas, which does spur more urban renewal projects. And really things are now rolling along pretty well. 

The vibe has really changed here. People always had pride for where we lived, but now it doesn't feel as misplaced as it used to.

I'll top this off by saying this, I love it here. An example why, I used a vacation to visit family in Buffalo here, while I lived in Vegas. When I got back people asked how the vacation was. I was like it was great, hit the beach, did some wineries, got some golf in....oh yeah where'd ya go, Cali? Nope just back home to Buffalo....."

When he bought his house, his basement had wood paneling halfway up the walls.  It looked like a cheap attempt at wainscoting so he just figured the sellers were trying to class up their unfinished basement.  After he'd been living there for a few years, he kept having to deal with water in the basement so he pulled off the paneling to investigate and found there was just dirt behind the panels.

The previous owners had dug out a crawlspace to make a basement with a 6' ceiling, but they hadn't bothered to extend the foundation down to the new depth!  My friend's house was resting on dirt that was being held up by nothing more than wood paneling.  That wainscoting was structural wainscoting!

It wasn't until I moved out and started using tampons and pads at the same time that I realized the problem wasn't that I wasn't changing them often enough, it was that my flow was rather heavy and I'd never had the proper tools to manage it.

The judge called me stupid, and told me to come back when I was smart enough to ask for child support. So I did, and asked for a minimum amount. He granted the divorce.

Now, my ex-husband pays the state, which charges him a processing fee, they hold on to the money for a week, and then deposit it into my account, minus another processing fee. And then I write my ex a check for $200, because the amount of child support they make him pay is more than half our kid's bills.. so please no.

No, that's actually the exact opposite of what happened. SyFy told them they were getting a season 5 and then told them they'd changed their minds and that the show was canceled literally right after the season 4 finale wrapped. That's why it ended on that massive cliffhanger, they decided to just leave it as they'd shot it rather than try to do last-minute reshoots to try to wrap it up."

It was a Tinder date. We matched and I decided to end the 8 month dry streak I’d been having by just being super forward about what I wanted. A few hours later, I’m at his house and we start hooking up. Without getting TOO graphic, anal was involved and that was no problemo. 

The real disaster happened when... let’s just say... his face was buried in my downstairs.  He was great! I was happy, he was happy and things got a bit escalated and as my body clenched up for tha climax.... I sprayed liquid shit onto his clean white sheets. I didn’t get any on him, but it was definitely pooled in front of his face.  Like, this isn’t the first time I’ve had a poopie accident during a furious bang sesh but never like this... last time was like a lil Ferraro Roché but THIS was like a cup of Hormel chili strewn across a bedspread. 

I ran straight to his bathroom and squatted in front of his bath tub spigot while washing my shame away as quickly as possible. I come out still naked and start getting my things gathered while avoiding all eye contact. He’d already gotten the sheets and bedspread gathered and in his washing machine and was totally calm. He wanted me to stay but I COULD NOT. I am still unsure if I’m in love with him or totally mortified that he reacted any way other than to vomit on me and freak the fuck out. 

Anyways, he walked me to my car and asked me to not ghost him because he really wanted to see me again and then he texted the next morning to wish me a good day at work. Life can be weird and stinky and embarrassing. 

TL;DR If you can do anal you can get away with anything 

EDIT: I’m definitely going to see him again. I am a single mom with a crazy schedule and dating doesn’t typically work out with me but he’s too sweet to not give it a chance. "

915,"Like many of you, I don't hate my kids. But, there are often times I really don't like them. My 6 yo has autism. But, very high functioning autism. Fully verbal with social and rigidity issues. He's so smart, but just comes across as condescending. And he ""seems"" typical in many ways, so sometimes it's easy to forget that he has social issues when he's acting like a complete asshole. I can't tell you how many times he threatened to punch me in the face today. Once was because I sent him to his room for trashing the kitchen when I told him to clean up the playdoh. His latest thing is that he demands that he gets his way now. Like, ""You WILL give me my dog back"" stuff. (He's overly attached to this stuffed dog.) He has NEVER gotten his way like that. I dont know how to stop it. I have never wanted to smack him so much as I did today and it took all my will power not to. I love him, but most times, I don't like him much. I hate to admit that. My 4 yo daughter is neurotypical,  but sandwiched between 2 boys, both needing a lot of support for different reasons. She's also always just been a clingy child. By the end of the day, I'm just all done with her trying to find her way back from where she came. The constant whining, the constant pushing of her older brother's buttons, the neediness. My 2 yo is a little trouble maker who is working his way to an autism diagnosis. Again, super high functioning. Fully verbal. Most people question his age after hearing him talk. But the rigidity is getting intense. Full blown tantrum today because we needed to go somewhere and he wanted to get his shoes on himself, needed to walk out the door, down the driveway, into the minivan, into his seat, get himself buckled, all by himself. He can't.  Like, he physically doesn't have the skills to do all this. The fact that he couldn't was the end of the world.

The density of cell towers is usually very low or you may simply not be in range of any (which is why it drains battery so quickly, as it turns up power to the antenna to try and get some kind of signal) and the same goes for wifi networks.

Related to this subject is the common myth that using GPS is a big battery drain. GPS is actually pretty efficient. The drain mostly comes from the fact that when we actively use GPS, it's for an app that has us leaving the screen on (such a navigation app) and the screen uses a lot of power. A phone with active GPS and screen off (for example a GPS logger app running) will last quite long."

I went to check on the kids and went back to the kitchen, I saw that my husband was now in the bathroom. Then the door opens again. And someone walks inside. He had bright red hair and I shit you not he was wearing a full white body suit! 

He came in and said he was just looking for a place to stay. I told him “THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE”. His eyes were darting all over the room and he kept coming in shushing me and saying it was ok. I yelled my husbands name, my tone was one I don’t normally use with him so he immediately came out of the bathroom. He asked what was wrong and then he saw the guy. My husband shoved me out of the way, darted around the counter and got right in the guys face telling him to leave. The guy just kept insisting it was ok and he just needed a place to stay. He kept trying to walk further into the house. 

Thank god the kids were asleep... then my husband just lost it even further. He pushed the guy, the guy keeps coming back. So he shoved him to the garage access door and kicked him in the chest as hard as he could. But the guy just got up and tried to come back in! So my husband (who now had the high ground) kicked him again and the guy kept asking why my husband was so mean?

My husband shoved him out of the garage and then my husband found his small ax in his tool box and chased him down the driveway and the street. The guy kept pleading with my husband and my husband is yelling at him “You’re lucky I couldn’t grab my gun! You could’ve been killed!” 

We were both really glad my husband couldn’t have grabbed his gun. Dude was obviously on something, it would’ve been awful for that to end his life. Not to mention our kids and learning about that... so yeah. Fuck guys in white jump suits. "

950,"In a prenup you’re required to disclose all assets and debts, and you also can allocate things like how debts incurred within the marriage are divided and who is responsible for them.

So as an example- you could spell out If that if one partner goes to school and takes out student loans to cover it, they would be responsible for that debt, it would not be a marital debt. 

That can be done with all sorts of debts and assets. Making sure inheritances don’t automatically become marital property or things like that. 

In my specific case, we married without a pot to piss in but within a couple years I was making great money. He decided to take some time off to “find himself” and I was ok with it at first but really he just stayed home getting fucked up, becoming increasingly abusive, spending a shit ton of money on credit cards I didn’t know about, cheating on me, and then when I finally left, his folks hired a lawyer I couldn’t compete with.

962,"Side Note / Maglight tip:

If you own an older Maglight with an incandesent bulb, you can order an LED bulb to replace it. 

One of the best things I have ever done. Ever since I put the LED bulb in, I have never had to replace the batteries. I'm not exactly sure how much light time an LED adds, but it seems pretty significant bc I use mine quite a bit. The bulbs aren't cheap, but u probably recover the cost of the bulb with one or two seta of new batteries.

Cons - the older mags reflectors are not perfectly designed for the LED replacement, but it makes no difference to me. It still works perfectly for what I use them for."

I scrambled last minute to find a place to live close to campus at the end of freshman year. Found this place that seemed pretty decent, 309$ a month free internet and cable. They would pair you with 3 other people in a 4br apartment. One of the dudes I ended up with seemed okay at first(26 yo grad student), but things turned probably 3 weeks into living with him. I'd wake up at 3 or 4am and go out to the kitchen to get a drink and heard him on the phone. Didn't think much of it, figured it was probably a ldr thing ""miss you"" ""can't wait to see you"" all that. Turns out he was talking to his mom. Shortly after she started coming and staying with him every game day weekend. Get there Friday morning first thing and not leave until Tuesday or Wednesday. You'd think it would stop when football season was over, but you'd be wrong lol. It hadn't stopped up until I'd moved out. From what the other roommates told me who had lived with him before, it's something they've done since his freshman year"

I learned a year or so ago that my mom went through this same thing (or close to it) before I was born. I'm the first child. I never knew. After I found out I talked to my dad about it. He told me he had gotten home from work in a good mood because the baby was on the way soon and my mom had a doctor appointment about it that day and so on. Got home to her crying like crazy. This was before cell phones were big and he didnt work where there was a phone readily accessible so he had no idea.

Could I then ask, of course depending on body language and social cues, whether the line ""I'd hate to intrude upon your night, but was wondering if I might buy you a drink?""

Now don’t get me wrong, I still accept some of the blame. It was my rule that caused me to shirk my cleaning the night before and allowed him an opportunity to slack off.

Making me apologize was fair enough, but I also remember her showing me off to the classroom as a 'monster,' that I was the source of all the pain that kids endure through public schooling. She didn't know me, had never before talked to me, and didn't forgive me, despite my blubbering, tear-choked apologies. As a fellow adult, you could laugh and walk it off, but as a child, the word of a teacher, an adult, was like the word of God.

1067,"I was kidnapped at 16 with my friend. 

 I don’t really know how to begin this. Sorry if it’s long. 

We had spent a week being unsupervised, young and reckless in a small beach town. There wasn’t much in the way of a good nights rest or healthy eating...we did the usual reckless teenager things, drinking/parties/dine and ditch/sneaking into pools/got into at least one drunken fight. Ok so we were pretty reckless.

Throughout the week we had seen this creepy junkie type guy around. Older, tall/lanky, long wild hair, track marks and just a general skeevy vibe. every day or so we’d see him here or there and one day he offered to buy us cookies. 

Fast forward to the end of the week, both looking worse for the wear, extremely tired/hungry and had lost or shoes on the beach the night before. Yeah it was bad. We are waiting early morning for our bus when he once again shows up out of seemingly nowhere. My memory is pretty foggy on this part so bear with me. I just remember it was completely deserted out and he told us he had a gun and we needed to go with him. So we did the only thing we thought we could do, we went with him. He made us walk off the Main Street area, no more sidewalk, no more houses. i just remember my bare feet were getting shredded on all these broken sharp rocks.  

We arrive to this shabby overgrown grass field with a dirty van. He pushes us inside, which is when I realize this is actually his home and he is full blown addict. The inside was disgusting, junk and clothes strewn everywhere, floppy stained mattress halfway overturned against side of van, and there was a small video player. 

He took the only money we had on us. (~$40, this was our bus fare home). I guess I’ll say here’s where things get more disturbing so this is your warning...

He puts porn on the small tv and starts getting set to shoot heroin. My friend, I don’t know if it was her way of dealing or just sheer exhaustion but she was nodding off. I went back and forth between turning the porn off (he’d turn it right back on when he noticed) to elbowing her hard to wake her up. My mind was racing trying to figure out how to get us out of here. No one knew exactly where we were. I had a cell phone but it was off, with only one battery bar. He continued being a perv. He would casually touch himself and say gross remarks. 

After what felt like eternity he starts talking about how we should party together, it’s no fun that we are sober and he’s not. I decide this is my only chance. I start going along with him saying how I’d love to get drunk right now. I suggest he take some of the money he took from us to go buy booze then we can all party and have fun. He goes for it. After rummaging around for awhile he finally puts his clothes back on and tells us to stay put. 

As soon as that door shut and we were alone I knew this was it. I had no plan other than we had to go NOW. We gave it a few moments to be sure he was gone then we just linked arms and made a run for it. "

On her next to last day, I confessed to her that I had been doing it.  I should have waited until her last day, because I came in the next day to my desk drawer completely stuffed with shredded paper, my desk chair almost completely wrapped in packing tape (the kind with string in it) and my mouse covered in black marker.

The ways this has affected my life negatively is obvious. I make myself physically sick and exhausted often. I have strained relationships and years of negative self talk that affects my self image and self esteem. I’ve wasted many hours of my life breaking down and crying, blankly staring at the wall, and self medicating with alcohol and marijuana. 

But my anxiety and depression do have positive impacts on my life as well, even if I have to look harder to see it. I’m a very imaginative and creative person, and I attribute a lot of this to my overactive brain constantly coming up with horror scenarios. I’m an empathetic and caring person. I feel that my experience with pain and loneliness and insecurities has made my heart bigger and more open to others struggling with similar problems. Overall, I’m also much more self aware than I believe I would be without any mental illnesses forcing me to evaluate myself often. "

I went in for a review and came out with a new title, an office, and a big raise. 

One of the other clerks was jealous, so he started saying he could do design work, too. I was pretty loaded so someone brought him up to do a Powerpoint for them. So I said, if he can do it, great. 

He took one of my old Powerpoints and just slapped the info from the new project on it. I saw it, brought it up with my boss. Nobody really acknowledged it, so I started covering my ass with that stuff.

1175,"This will probably get burried at this point but here goes. I am a cancer survivor I was diagnosed at the age of 2 so I personally don’t remember any of the signs but my parents do. So here’s what I know. Before my diagnosis I became really out of character I was ill but it seemed more than a normal cold. My mum had her suspicions that something was up so decided to take me to the doctors. The doctor checked me over and said I was fine and that it was probably just a bug that I had picked up and that my family should take me home and go enjoy Christmas with me (my parents began to notice the signs a few days before Christmas). So Christmas came and I lay on the couch the whole day. I barely played with any of my toys and showed little interest. This is when my parents really began to get worried so after Christmas my mum took me back to the doctor who at this point ran tests on me. Spoiler alert: I had leukaemia. One other point I forgot to mention is that my mum was heavily pregnant at this point with my sister and her due date was for early January so the doctors thought it best that they keep my diagnosis hidden from my mum until after she had the baby in fear that her finding out could lead to a bad birth. My mum found out anyway and unsurprisingly broke down and a few weeks later had my sister with no complications. I finished my treatment when I was 6 and I have been cancer free for 12 years now !! It was a long road to recovery and it definitely made me who I am today. Life is amazing. It has it’s moments don’t get me wrong but if you can beat cancer you can beat a lot of things.  and in one week I will begin university to study as an architect. Something my parents only dreamed of when I was on my treatment.

**1 Year in Advance**

An agency of the United States (or the UN if you want to scale this to world-size) announces the game. All persons who wish to participate must register at least 6 months prior to the start of the game and, for an entry fee of $200, are given a nano-implant which can be read by smartphone to tag the person as ""out"". To keep the game going and get people to actually find each other, each find is worth a $100 prize. Roughly 95% of the country's population are expected to join, with a projected profit of $29.303 Billion. Politicians promise that this money will be used for healthcare reform and educational programs. The day of the start of the game is declared a federal holiday.

**6 Months in Advance**

True to expectations, about 89% of the population has registered. Even the homeless have saved up and registered. Blue- and white-collar workers alike have bought for themselves a ticket to a better life. At $100 per find, finding even ten people can turn a whole life around.

**1 Week Before**

Gradually millions of Americans disappear from social life. Families are fragmented as players disperse to hiding places selected and prepared well in advance. In some rural areas entire families disappear into heavily fortified bunkers, hoping to wait out the game - some in hopes of winning. More prescient citizens elect to leave the country. Airline tickets are very high and airports are crowded.

**1 Day Before**

Whole towns have turned into ghost villages. Traffic is extremely light everywhere, as most hiders have already holed up. Entire businesses are forced to close due to employees not reporting for their duties. Public services struggle to perform their daily duties. Large industrial operations shut down or are switched to automatic, on the promise that crews will return in 48 hours.

The police receive a few thousand calls nationwide about groups of people - families, offices - being held hostage by masked intruders waiting to make finds of them. Authorities suspect that these calls represent only a small portion of such incidents actually ongoing.

**Day 0 - 09:00 AM EST**

The streets are *almost* barren, aside from the few people who are not participating. They struggle to go about their daily lives: most grocery stores, gas stations, offices and services are closed or offline while the majority of the country is suddenly missing. A few players - either already caught or not interested in hiding - can be seen wandering about searching public places.

**Day 1 - 02:00 PM EST**

While most areas appear calm, the news is now reporting that police are overwhelmed with calls of break-ins and trespassing. Determined to find people, players are forcing their way into homes and businesses to ""capture"" families and other players. Small troupes of players have teamed together to efficiently ferret out hiders in urban areas.

**Day 1 - 07:00 PM EST**

Emergency services are already overwhelmed with calls of break-ins, vandalism, and isolated violence as unscrupulous players disregard the law to secure finds. Hospitals are already straining with insufficient staff and high occupancy due to violence among players. Reports of non-players and those-already-found being harassed by other players fill the news.

Afraid of the even worse ramifications of denying players their money, authorities refuse to terminate or modify the game.

**Day 1 - 10:00 PM EST**

The national guard and armed services have been called into most population centers to combat growing bands of players turning the city inside out. Furniture and garbage fill the streets as objects are ejected from buildings. Cars are burned in some places, and looting is now growing out of control. Emergency services are now completely unavailable. Hospitals have, if they were lucky enough to get them, armed guards to protect the staff who may not have been ""found"" by anyone yet. Information networks are buckling under the load of people trying to contact each other.

**Day 2 - 12:00 PM EST**

Roughly 50% of players have been found. Urban areas are now under martial control with a 24-hour curfew, though many buildings have been burned in effort to ""smoke"" out hiding players. Some larger fires are still raging. Hospitals are beginning to recover as most injuries are non-critical. In the most heavily populated areas the game is over.

Suburban areas are still in trouble. Whole families have been destroyed by betrayals and third-party assailants. Reports of murder and other violent crimes are coming in faster than emergency services can handle. Many homes are on fire or are otherwise trashed. Despite police being on 24-hour patrol, gangs sweep the neighborhoods vandalizing and searching houses.

Rural areas have it the worst. Whole towns, including their small police departments,  have fallen to ruling bands of players. Armed players are holding citizens captive partly for their finds and partly to exploit the lapse of rule-of-law. In at least one rural area an entire town has been paralyzed by a sniper and one other player working together to kill and then find anyone seen leaving town.

**Day 5**

90% of players have been found. Between armed services, the national guard, and local police order has mostly been restored. SWAT has removed most armed players, including the sniper who is now fabulously wealthy - and famous thanks to the media.

Building fires are now uncommon but still reported. Most workers having been found, hospitals have fully recovered and are now back to normal.

Businesses which were forced to shut down due to disorder and lack of labor are beginning to report their losses in the billions, with further losses to continue due to interruptions in the supply chain.

Unofficial reports place the death toll in the thousands.

A forest fire is rapidly growing in West Virginia, believed to have been set by players attempting to flush out those hiding in the mountains. Similar fires rage in California and Kentucky.

**Day 10**

98% of players have been found. Many were caught as they stumbled from the woods, out of food and other provisions.

Local businesses are selling catchy t-shirts and other merchandise about ""The Find"". It is common for people to (rudely) scan each other as they pass on the streets or in shops, just to be sure. The media has begun speculating about what will happen if the final player is found dead.

Those responsible for the game are widely condemned for the destruction and disruption caused by the game. Though the federal government has made a massive profit state governments, insurance agencies, charities and businesses all report losses which together total in the trillions. Resignations are demanded. Peaceful protests take place in Washington DC.

**Day 11**

The agency responsible for the game confirms reports of a data breach four hours after a list of the 147 remaining players' names and addresses are posted online. To protect the families of the remaining players many of their homes are placed under immediate police protection. In at least one case the home is defended by armed community members. *All* of those not protected by armed personnel are razed or looted within twelve hours. Fourteen deaths directly result from the data breach.

**Day 30**

Two players remain. Several of the final ten were found by hacking those players' phones. Player number eight was armed and killed two people as they approached his hiding place, one of whom hadn't even been a player.

A tour group in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky finds player number four dead at the bottom of a sheer drop deep within the caverns. The official report is that he slipped and fell to his death trying to hide in the caves.

After hundreds of residents in a small New Mexico town report to a local medical center with identical symptoms a public health investigation discovers player number six drowned and decomposing in the municipal water tower.

**Day 45**

Two players still remain. The hashtag #findthem is everywhere. Though the state department insists that both players are still in the country, rumors circulate about players being smuggled out on cargo ships or railroad. One Ecuadorian man appears on television claiming to have harbored one of the two fleeing to the rainforests of Brazil.

**Day 366**

Memorial services are held nationwide for those who died in The Find. Flags are at half and a federal holiday is observed.

The families of the final two players receive tremendous unwanted media attention as they await their return. One of the children of a ""Top-Two"" pleads for her daddy to come home.

State and federal governments refuse to assist in finding the two missing persons. There are reports of black-market bounties being placed for both of them.

**5 Years After**

The final death toll of The Find is more than 12,000. Final totals for fiscal losses are in the trillions. Foreign citizens around the world laugh derisively when talking about the US's biggest public work blunder in history. The president at the time lost his bid for reelection.

Occasionally reports surface that one or both of the Top-Twos have been sighted or even killed. None of these reports can be confirmed. Both are still missing but authorities refuse to presume either player dead. One of the children of a Top-Two has committed suicide whilst another is in prison on drug charges. Two have become public officials specializing in emergency response planning and management.

1267,"Some guys like it when their girl gets anonymous attention like that. I know my boyfriend does. He once put my nudes up somewhere (with my permission) and loved the responses. And tbh I did too

1268,"Yeah, while I in no way condone what Lennon did, it always bothers me a bit to see him show up in these threads alongside the likes of Ian Watkins, Bill Cosby, Jimmy Savile, etc. He did some horrible shit in his youth, but seemed genuinely contrite and wanting to change [by the end of his life.](http://www.beatlesarchive.net/john-lennons-last-interview-december-8-1980.html) 

He fucked up as a father to Julian, but wanted to do better by Sean. He fucked up as a partner to Cynthia, but couldn't imagine being separated from Yoko. He spoke about the importance of practicing what he preached WRT causes like feminism, instead of simply being a cynical mouthpiece for various ""hip"" social justice issues. Now, just how sincere he was about all of that is anyone's guess, but the fact of the matter is that we'll never know what sort of person he might have become, since he was murdered. I don't really think he's deserving of the standard Reddit ""this thing is bad"" circlejerk, at any rate."
1269,"The exception is if there's no other spaces. The rule is simply don't go to the urinal directly next to someone if there are others available. Don't know where this guy gets ""you have to wait"". Some people can't wait. "
1270,"I'm in love with one of my best friends. She made an off-hand remark once about how if it wasn't for her ex who she had just broken up with and was getting over, that she'd be with me by now. We hadn't been friends for long, and I was helping her get over him, so I didn't want to push that. 

Now, I think it was probably *just* an off-hand remark, but I've been in love with her since the day I met her. It's easy to fall in love, but hard to fall out of it. "

If someone asks where you're from, give as vague of an answer as they will accept. ""I've moved around a lot"" or ""Not far from here"" etc.

1299,"Homestuck is a webcomic. It's about four kids who play a computer game together that brings about the end of the world.

It's a very creative bit of media. Since the idea is the kids are all internet friends, all the dialogue is done through drop down chat logs as opposed to speech bubbles. The comic utilizes music, animation, interactive sections, and all sorts of other stuff. I won't get into the plot too much, because a lot of the fun is seeing how it turns from basically nothing into whatever it turns into, but if any of this sounds interesting I'd recommend checking it out.

https://www.homestuck.com/  is where the comic is hosted. If you do check it out, I'd recommend sticking with it, at least for a little while. Almost everyone, myself included, quit pretty soon on our first attempt, since the art style, humor, and general lack of plot early on is tough to get used to. At least read through the first act, and see how you like it after that."

1313,"The part I loved about scar so much is that they highlighted the thought process of religious extremists without shoving the authors own morality into it. That allowed Scar to be a truly bad for good resons character because when you removed all bias from it he was kinda justified (except a few deaths). Another thing I enjoyed about Scar is that they didn't take the easy predictable route with his development, he never once claimed to enjoy the killing and violence, and you could see how just absolutely disinterested, even bordering disgusted, he was with it all. Scar will always be my 10/10 antagonist."

1328,"I was touring around Aushwitz with my family and as everyone knows its one of the most disturbing places to witness. Nothing even remotely funny about it - unless you have the most melodramatic, intense and strange tour guide.

He would be finishing up a really disturbing fact like, ""1.1 million people died or were killed here..."" and would say it very slowely and... spaced... out... He would purse his lips once finished, attempt to make individual eye contact with tour attendees, pause, then look to the ground and shake his head as if saying ""awe shucks."" This happened every time he said something (I didn't need his acting skills to signal the tragedy haunting this place).

I don't know if it was out of pure discomfort, from the theatrics or what, but right after the tour guide would finish serving some heinous fact, my dad and I would then spend the next 15 seconds trying to muffle some intense laughter by fake coughing and looking away. In no way, shape or form were we laughing at the horrors of the holocoust, but it sure looked like it.

1373,"I’m going to accept your intial calculations and pick up where you left off.

You have an 11-ton solid gold statue that you’ve been telling neighbors if just a cheap halloween decoration for a couple weeks already.  They’re getting suspicious, so you’re going to need a few sheets of teflon, some jacks, and a come-along to drag that thing into the garage where you can claim it has disappeared while you work on it.

You’ll need a crucible and a mess of propane and propane-related accessories, so call Hank Hill.  24kt is pretty soft, so a hacksaw will do to break up the chunks, but you’re going to get tired and go buy a sawsall real quick.  Just remember how important shop tidiness is when your saw dust is worth $50 a gram.  Sweep often and carefully.

Now the tax question is irrelevant if this golden bear came into existence on your property through magical means.  We’ll assume that like most people, you value personal wealth over the opportunity to initiate the first scientific examination of an actual miracle in human history.  

So you’re balls deep in to the process of melting things like golden bear-fingers and bear ears and bear dicks into standard 1oz rounds of 0.9999 pure gold with some type of crude counterstamp for people to recognize.  The molds can be easily created using sand casts of modern coins and your favorite etsy friend when it comes to designing the clay.

Now, no one will argue as soon as they prove through testing that your product is marked accurately, but you want to keep if off the radar, lest the tax man or physicist get wind.  So you turn to the coin and pawn shops.  Again, your shit tests out as good, so these guys won’t give you more than a long eye.  A good coin shop shout give you spot minus 5% or better.  Pawn shops are less generous because they don’t have the solid connections to move raw bullion that quick.

The law requires any transactions over $9,999.99 to be declared by both parties, so assuming you can find a few unconnected outlets, you might be moving $50 - $100k a month.  At that rate, it results in income of about $1.2M a year.  That’s insufficient, because that would still take hundreds of years to move the whole urside.  So we have to get more extreme.  Basically, you’ve only managed to get attention of the front line guys.  Here is where you need to step up.  Kind of like when the good guys try to score a meeting with the ‘boss’ so they can make a score.

This is where your new income comes jn handy.  Everyone gets bespoke suits and fancy wristwatches.  One guy carries an expensive gun, bot with the intent of using it, but just so everyone know when they strip him that he’s a badass on the way to the meeting.

Trying to move $250M in gold is foreign to me or the movies.  YoU’ll probably be taking a 25% cut, but whatever.  Once you get the money, run to the mediterranean or latin south america and low-key love like kings.  And hope that bears cubs don’t ever find you to claim their vendetta."
1374,"Dude, that's not true. Look, some people don't need all the other shit. No porn (which I think creates this idea in the first place), no bondage, no anal, no freak show what so ever.

1411,"So I was a Succulents attendant at Target for about three years. During that time the original one that trained me died, and the guy that started after me, (coincidentally my step dad) got fired. Leaving me. They never hired another. I told them several times that they needed to let me train people on the succulent loader because once I turned 39 and got out of college I was gone.

Well graduation came, found a better job, and I let em know. They beg to give them more time to find a replacement so I could train them. So I did. Four years it took. I leave after a lovely time, they finally find a replacement. I visit just to say hi to old coworkers And see a girl pushing the loader. There’s also people in regular clothes pushing a buttload of cars?

I went in and told my old manager because that's  not really something they encourage. He goes ""not again."" Come to find out this girls parents literally had been coming to her shifts to help her out because pushing carts was too hard. Not really sure why this was my business but really happy for my step dad. Mom is such a lovely person."

We got closer and I  noticed he was doing the same, making short eye contact before looking away. We eventually got close enough that I saw it was him. We made unbroken eye contact as we passed each other. It was 100% him. I felt like saying hello, but I couldn't bring myself to. We passed each other, and that was it.

I was already a traumatized, broken kid even before my sister had to stop her partway through downing her bottle of pain pills to drive her to the psych ward, and after that I became so numb that I just completely shut down emotionally for many years. I didn't fully understand how scarred I was until years later, during a couple mushroom trips where I broke down violently sobbing and crying for close to an hour straight. By all rights I should have cried that hard soon after it happened like you did, instead of bottling it up for years. I'm still not fully over it really."

Really!?), and there's no way in hell Jaime survived falling into a deep lake in full plate.

That said, it was all quite fun to watch, so I can't complain that much.

EDIT: I forgot the fact that Littlefinger, one of the best villains of all time, ultimately manages to cause a little teen drama and then die.

I don't know if I ever will mentally be in that place.

I recently made a big decision which was to get lipo and an abdominoplasty in hopes that it could help me gain more body confidence to boost me on my way to recovery. It's been a month since then and I've noticed a big difference in the way I feel about me.

Later that day when I got home I scooted straight upstairs and flung myself on my bed, I started rubbing my palms all over my crotch but my inner feelings could not be satisfied. So I grabbed a plushie and soaked it in tap water, ripped its neck open and plucked some plush out. I then put my prepubescent penis inside the puppy and penetrated its mangled neck. I actually came so hard that the neighbors called 911 to verify there wasn't a murder going on, what can I say? I had a very loud voice for my age.

 to the woman for a few minutes.  I think I was maybe 15 at the time.  While they were talking, the girl's mother reached out and pulled away the neckline of my shirt to make sure I was wearing a bra, and I've never seen the back of my mother's hand move so fucking fast in my life."

(Aside: Being white and walking with a black guy has a chance of getting you stopped too in some areas, because obviously there's a drug deal about to happen)

 In my area, I'd say it's for the most part a lot less racist than it was, but the racism is a lot more subtle. For example, we had a black family move onto my street the other day and my dad was saying 

&gt;""I know this is bad to say, and I'm sure the new neighbors are alright but they're black so *make sure* you lock the deadbolt too when you leave the house."" 

Of course, they did end up being nice people, I found out. The mother works for a local university, another kid is in one of the better schools in the area, and another is going to the community college before he transfers to a 4-year one. What makes this specific situation murky is how much of it is a perceived class thing too, because if my dad took a quick look at the people moving in and they happened to look like ""rednecks,"" ""white trash,"" or what have you he'd be saying something very similar; just replace fear of being robbed by black strangers with fear of being robbed by white hicks for meth money.

Or you'll also have the cliche phrase you'll sometimes hear of ""I like black people, but not 'niggers.'"" Never in public, of course. 

Luckily, ideas like that *are* becoming much less common in my area. Shit's sure taking its time though. FWIW, I do live in a small city of about 15,000-35,000 so I'm sure I'd have a different story if I lived in a place with a population of like, 500, or some shit.

1739,"When I was 13 I played the cello and my grandparents sent me to Interlochen Arts Camp as my bat mitzvah present. When you fly with a cello, you have to buy it a seat so the baggage handlers don’t smash your expensive ass instrument, and (back in 1997, at least) it has to be next to a bulkhead in case of emergency.

On the way home, the flight was oversold and they moved my cello from the last row of coach with me to the first row of first class. Just the cello. I went and strapped it in and then went back to my seat in the back.

About five years ago I wrote a silly [tumblr post](http://intosnarkness.tumblr.com/post/70268632384) about this which went viral and has since garnered a little under 400k notes. I framed it as the cello getting upgraded without me.

1744,"Being a shitty person.

Hear me out on this one...

I’ve lamented about my SIL and her son who is a school shooting waiting to happen. During a recent visit I was made aware of the sheer depths of how shitty both she and my BIL are.

Having a party? They will buy dozens of folding chairs and folding tables from Costco and then return them the next day.

No pets allowed and they want to bring their dog? No problem! They bought their untrained dog a service dog vest.

Dunkin out of their favorite donut one morning? She will gladly be late to her next appointment so that she can berate a manager during the rush and then brag about how she got things for free. Every.time.

She’s a housewife and she wanted some more money. So she went doctor shopping until she got a diagnosis that won her some social security. 

Her psycho son has killed more small animals than I can count. “He doesn’t know his own strength” she says. Then she throws a fit if a petting zoo kicks him out because he’s very obviously on the verge of killing their animals. Most recently she took issue because I wouldn’t let him “play” with the chickens I raise. When noting that chickens aren’t toys, she became indignant and tried to escalate the complaint up to my wife who, much to her chagrin, sided with me.

Basically, she is just a completely selfish shitty person who married a guy who, by all accounts, was decent years ago but who has been conditioned to be shitty and selfish as well. They have shitty selfish kids. The worst part is that it isn’t like they are breaking laws and may, one day, get caught.

It’s like some malicious compliance shit. If it is legal to do, they do it if it serves their interests. Waitress has to clean up a giant mess? That’s her job, Costco has to restock 25 chairs? That’s their job. You got some teenager at a petting zoo fired because when he stopped your psycho son from breaking a baby goats neck you raised hell on social media that the teenager was ableist and discriminating against st your disabled son? Fuck him. 

There is no easy fix. But I goddamn wish that some divine force would just intervene and make people like this just stop being shitty. Don’t make more rules. Don’t make social media shaming even worse. Just make people stop being fucking shitheads and being some damn cheery about whatever shitty thing they did that day like it was some positive achievement."

365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365 * ... * 344/365 * 343/365 * (365-23 = 342)/365 = 0.46 (chance of finding the good combinaison OR 0.54 to have a collision)

We also had issues with homeless people slipping in before the main doors were locked for the night so they could sleep in the stairwell. Sometimes it was people asking for a room but they creeped me out. 

The way the hotel worked is that most of the doors outside were locked 24/7 but could be opened with a room key. That meant we really only had to watch the front door. The front door had a magnetic lock, a buzzer and a camera. If someone arrived after midnight, they would need to buzz and talk to us. We could press a button that disengaged the lock on the door. 

Sometimes we would get people showing up late at night who didn't have a reservation and they're looking for a room. I've seen people acting strangely while talking to them through the intercom. People who are fidgety, looking around a lot, etc. I suspect a few if the stranger ones were on drugs.

There were two incidents where I needed to call the police, though. One was a blind guy who was meeting up with a love interest. He threatened to kill her and then commit suicide. She came down to the lobby and asked me to call the police. While we were waiting for them, the guy had started pouncing himself in the face while he was wearing all these rings. The police spent some time with them and decided it was best for the woman to find another hotel. But they left the guy. Yeah, he was blind, but I still didn't want to be alone with him as a guest. That was a scary night. Luckily there was nothing else. He quietly left in the morning without incident."

1840,"There's an hour-long video I watched that breaks down exactly why Sherlock started to fail as a TV show and it really does hit the nail on the head: in most of the original stories, the clues that Sherlock puts together are laid out before the other characters (and thus, the audience) and it theoretically gives you a chance to figure it out yourself.  
  
The TV show constantly relies on off-screen revelations or impossibly obscure things Sherlock already knew or figured out."
1841,"You should watch it anyways. It's truly fantastic, and knowing ahead of time that it ends abruptly helps it hurt a little less. Seriously, though, there isn't really anything else quite like it. "

1851,"If the partners come from different cultures/ backgrounds, it's important to discuss how much of each other's culture is to be passed along to children.  My ex husband absolutely refused for our child to learn my mother tongue ( Italian) because he didn't consider it important enough and he thought it would cause problems with English in school ( reading, etc.) .  This really bothered me and offended my mother ( the nonna).  I felt like my culture was not given any importance.  
This was a very important point that definitely should have been discussed but I didn't think of bringing it up before marriage.  It was one of the issues  that deteriorated our marriage.  "

That and it's just a great cartoon that deserves more from it. :)"
1862,"It's been years since I saw the episode, so this isn't about their handling of it, but kinda a counterpoint to the idea that selflessness is a virtue in this case.

No human being should feel guilty for existing. They're not responsible for their parents' choices or how things turned out for people with agency before they were even a zygote. They're not responsible for far off butterfly effect shit.

It is not selfish for a person to continue to live based on things they had no control over. Sure, not doing so for the sake of other people would be profoundly selfless, but that doesn't make it *good* or even the moral choice.

And, considering how many kids feel like or even *told* that they ruined their parents' life or that they're a burden, a ""fuck you"" message to all that bullshit would be timely and welcome.

A lot of parents would be richer and more economically successful if they didn't have kids. I feel like these kind of stories depict that as objectively an better life, but it's not."
1863,"Fun fact! The average movie score takes 3-4 weeks to compose, but Howard Shore took months (can't remember exactly how long) to write lord of the rings. Individual character, location, and key object themes, most choral parts in Tolkien's languages, and the themes are reprised but with different tone at different points. 

For example, there's the general hobbits theme that plays when the four hobbits are all happy and together and pre-adventure. It plays again, subtly and sadly, when Merry and Pippin reunite on the battlefield in Return of the King. "

We live in a very Chinese (and I'm also Chinese) area, and it seems that light sleep runs in the older generations, considering my mom's inability to sleep just by me rolling to much in a room across the hall back in the days!

Finally one morning I was like super close to the end (can't quite remember what happened because it's super long ago) and the game hung up because of a scratch, my sister put into the fucking mini disk when she switched to Harry Potter last time...

Well what if he's limping because he hit his leg on a way to his work or maybe he worked to hard on his leg day yesterday? And dig tags are just promotional  stuff from new cod? 

""This guy has red nose and reeks of alcohol, clearly he has problems with his liver and I should punch him there""

What if he has allergy reaction or flu and it was his birthday yesterday?

Always made me roll eyes when House sees one little fucking minuscule detail and can conclude everything up to what this guy ate when he was four years old while traveling to big canyon with his dad who cheats on his wife with girl from work who is also bisexual. "

1888,"The mob is still very much alive and well. The just own chunks of towns and businesses with holding corporations.

They even elected a mob guy mayor of Las Vegas. I can't believe the voters did it, which is one of the reasons I will never go there. It is all a big flashy con to scam your money.

The North American House Hippo is a creature that can be found throughout Canada and the Eastern United States. The House Hippo is a very timid creature and is rarely seen. While normally a quiet animal that prefers to stay unnoticed, the House Hippo is very territorial and will defend its territory if provoked. The House Hippo comes out at night to search for food and water. The favourite foods of the House Hippo include chips, raisins and the crumbs from peanut butter on toast. The House Hippo will come out at night to search for materials for its nest. They tend to build their nests in bedroom closets with mittens, dryer lint and bits of string. The House Hippo sleeps 16 hours a day, only coming out to search for food and water and materials for its nest. Also, due to their timid nature, they chose to only come out at night while you are most likely are sleeping. "
1900,"Weight *management* for cancer patients is ***VERY VERY*** different than weight *loss* to lose excess fat.



Your dad's nutritionist was trying to make sure he eats *enough*, and enough of the right foods.  Between the disease, chemo, and medications, cancer patients are often at threat of malnutrition.  They also have altered sense of taste, so the list of foods that cancer patients can tolerate needs to be highly nutritious, easily chewable and digestible, and very bland tasting.  Even if they come up with the perfect combination of foods, it wont do any good if the patient wont eat it, or cant keep it down and vomits it back up because of the chemo meds.


This is why the oncology nutritionists dont give a shit about calories.  Because whatever they feed the patient, it wont be enough.  Their goal is ensuring the patient doesnt starve to death.


This is very different than an otherwise healthy person trying to lose weight for aesthetic, long-term health, and self-confidence reasons.

1913,"We've recently moved, but my mom used to live in a neighborhood for nearly six years. For those six years, two houses down from us was a woman with a puffy dog who *always* wore short, tight gym shorts. I've never seen her without them. We'd call her ""crazy lady"" because of that, and because she was extremely eccentric.

1. She's maybe 50 or sixty, and I'd babysit her dog went I was high school. The thing was, she'd still be *there* while I watched her dog--trimming her lawn. And I'd watch the dog as I sat outside. Why I needed to be there, I have no idea. But I got paid so I didn't complain. 

2. Before we moved, she came to my mom asking to use our trash cans because ""if my husband sees that I cut the plants, he'd be mad. So can I put the leaves in your trashcan instead?"" My mom agreed, because how else are you suppose to *respond* to that??

3. A week before we moved, my sister was walking home from high school. Crazy Lady saw her and asked, ""Do you live around here?"" My sister told her yes, right down the street--because, you know, we've only been in that house for *6 years* and she's met my sister multiple times. My sister goes home. And a few days later, when Crazy Lady came to ask for the trashcans, she sees my sister and goes ""you've grown so much.""

I'm not sure if it's drugs, or maybe alzheimer's. Or maybe something else entirely, but she was a nice woman, nevertheless. Just a bit odd. *Really* odd. "

Up until that point, you'd only been fighting corpse robbers, armed with wooden clubs. It starts off difficult, but then you feel like you've gotten the hang of combat.

The all of a sudden, you're forced to fight  a very well armed and armored bandit. That, and at that point in the game, your only armor is likely an iron skullcap and a padded gambeson.

Nobody wants to listen to a rapper who has his personal life in order, lives in a mansion, and subs his pillows for bags of money.

That's why 50 Cent's career died. Hard to listen to someone rap around crack, pimping, and gangbanging when said person is living in Farmington, CT in the middle of whiteyville where the most dedicated hustlers on the street are girl scouts selling cookies."

1970,"I couldn’t disagree more. I absolutely loved the ending and the last season. It explained so much that we watched during the first 4 seasons. There were parts that I questioned but as a whole the season was great. 

As for the finale it was tremendous. Not just the last scenes but the whole episode. “Peter, you are my favorite thing. My very favorite thing.” Then him going to the future so Peter and Olivia would be able to have their family back. Then the last scene with them in the house and Peter getting the white tulip.

1975,"I grew up with Gilmore Girls, and was about eight years old when the series came out. 

As an adult and having rewatched the series 273617271964 times like an avid fan does, I can’t help but realize how unlikable Rory is, and how Lorelei has some very deep rooted impulsivity issues, especially with men and relationships. Rory’s character comes off through the whole series as, “I’m different and more humble than all of you because even though I go to this fancy school, I’m from the sticks.” Um, no, your grandparents are loaded, you didn’t have to work for any of it, and you probably have a massive trust fund and inheritance coming your way. Logan actually pointed that out to her one episode, and I want to give him a pat on the back. 

The Year in a Life return was so disappointing, and made Rory’s character even worse. The consistency with her character from the last few seasons of being an entitled brat were enhanced, and she showed that she truly is an awful journalist. What journalist falls asleep on the job and sleeps with someone she’s interviewing?

Overall, fantastic show and witty writing, and I will always be Team Jess and Team Luke. But, yeah... That show was good at tricking you into believing that Lorelei and Rory were these wholesome, good charactered people."
1976,"that show was a fucking masterpeice, doubt there will ever be another show quite like it. the way they made mobsters seem so real, relatable and hatable at the same time was amazing, not to mention some of the funniest goddam scenes of all time are from that show.

the show delivered right up until the very end, then left us all just kind of scratching our heads. i didn't love it, but they did it their own way and didn't really leave many questions unanswered so at the end of the day why complain? i just love that show for what it was."

FTFY"
1999,"A simple ""you know I'm always here for you, right?"", can be enough. Or ask them out/round for a drink and when people are more relaxed they might want to open up.

But they might just not want to open up, so don't push the issue."
2000,I’ve spent half a work day with one inside out. I just thought maybe I had allergies or some other kind of irritant in my eye. 
2001,"Also, have kids before you have had enough horrible students that ruin good names for you. 

The missus started teaching 18 years ago. Some names of kids from her first few years still cause her eye to twitch. "
2002,Management having IT background? What world do you live in?
2003,You didn't.  Walmart would scan them and see that they didn't come from Walmart.
2004,"Here is what gets me about the phone calls. No one *knows* who called Autotrader and asked for Hallibach. Someone with access to his phone called, that’s all anyone can assume. Anyone can call and say ‘my name is Steven’."
2005,Game stop employees who give you $4 for a game you bought for $60 
2006,Should have added a serious tag. Otherwise people will be asking for crazy things like Large Tits of females being sent via PM.
2007,"It's more that like theres a difference between treating your friends the same regardless of their sexuality (which is fine) and ignoring that queer and straight people often live very different lives. It's like that SnL skit where Elizabeth banks plays black jeopardy because she doesn't see color, and then loses because she doesn't understand black culture. We [the LGBTQ community]have a long history of separate culture, we have more trouble finding relationships because only a small percent of the population is gay and if you make a mistake and flirt with a straight person, you have a very real risk of being beaten up depending on who you are talking to. Its harder for us to have kids because theres really no way besides adoption or sperm donors (which doesn't work if both people in the relationship have penises). A large number of us have little to no contact with our biological families, so things like Mothers Day/Fathers Day or Christmas can be depressing instead of exciting. Stuff like that."
2008,Masturbate.

2010,When they were trying to find what cause a cholera epidemic and John Snow found the cause.
2011,the entire half life series released in an orange box style remaster. 
2012,"Little know fact, Lindt is actually just Hershey's chocolate that hasn't touched the floor. /s"
2013,I can only imagine what the police is thinking when the  school administrator calls in to say there is an assault that happened at the school. The police man shows up only to find out it was someone who accidentally got brushed against during while walking through the halls getting to class. I'd say after a few of those calls they'd tell her to stop wasting their time.

2017,"After a sexual harassment case, HR decided to give us 2000+ employees laminated, colored cards in red, yellow, &amp; green. 

+ Red = Inappropriate Behavior 
+ Yellow = Use Caution w/Behavior
+ Green = Appropriate Behavior

The intent was, if someone was uncomfortable with another’s behavior, you gave them the designated card. 

It turned into a massive joke and quickly became a game to see who could accrue the most red cards. "

2023,"At one of my favorite jobs the boss said "" lobster, crab and steak are off limits, everything else is ok."" It was great. On Sundays the boss would make a big breakfast brunch for the employees lunch break."
2024,"I just went to a bistro last week and ordered a spinach/feta/strawberry salad. The presentation was beautiful but made it nearly fucking impossible to eat. The plate was a rectangle about 18” long by 4” wide; the bed of spinach stretched across the whole plate, but the strawberry, feta, and pistachio were all in little like 1” wide sections in the dead center of the plate. So I’m sitting in this fancy restaurant trying to carefully mix and eat my salad, but I look like a palsied street urchin who’s never held a fork before because the spinach keeps flying over the shallow lip around the edge and fuck I just wanted to eat this tasty salad!"
2025,"Aren't you just supposed to write ""What chair?"" and go home?"
2026,"I envy the investigators, their job sounds so fun. I wish I could spend more time going out in the field and interviewing people and getting the scoop. I hope you find a way to get back into it. It really is very fulfilling work. Have you considered clerking at a public defender or prosecutor office? Idk where you live but if your local offices are well-funded, some of the ones in bigger cities pay in the high teens. Court reporters are also paid well and work reasonable hours, from what I understand. It's not exactly slumming it in the gutters, which is the most fun, but you still get plenty of exposure. If it's really not an option to get back into the field, consider making an inmate your penpal! They LOVE to talk about their case to anybody who will listen and they're exceedingly lonely. I forget the site, but there is a website where you can find inmates who have computer privileges and are lonely for correspondence. It's tangential, but it might be a cool thing to do that would really brighten someone's existence."
2027,"For 2.5 years I watched my wife deteriorate ever so slowly from cancer.  In her last few weeks she went downhill in a hurry; she was barely recognizable physically, couldn't really communicate.  Hospice care is a bitch, but at least she was home at the end.

You don't stop loving them - you love who they were.  You knew them at their best, and this isn't their fault or their choice.  The care IS the ""demonstration of love""."
2028,"Use of ridiculously unsafe x-raying continued until much later, too! X-Ray shoe fitters were used into the 70s, and I remember breaking my arm in the late 70s or very early 80s and there was a live view of my bones on a screen as the doctors re-set it.

I mean that was super advanced for its time, but I'm counting the freckles on that arm regularly, just sayin."
2029,Holy shit FJ. Thanks for briefly reminding me of my pre reddit days. I remember there was a big controversy about this Reddit site stealing content from funny junk users so I went to check it out. And here we are.

2034,"True, 100%. This also leads to the phenomenon of pooping during childbirth (the pressure in the area is just too much!).   

Also comes into play with a nasty childbirth injury called an obstetric fistula. It's one of the primary drivers behind various campaigns to raise the age of marriage worldwide, so that young girls (who are statistically more prone than mature young women) don't have their lives absolutely ruined by an early birth. "
2035,"I think most people here just talk about buying strawberries by size. ""I bought a pint of strawberries"" or whatever. But the baskets we use are definitely punnet baskets. [See the wiki pic for confirmation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnet)"
2036,Which one is the man and which one is the other man? 
2037,"Not a truck driver, but I absolutely REFUSE to go anywhere near Atlanta, GA.  Doesnt matter if I fly or drive, something bad happens EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Highlights include:

- car's engine dying in the middle of I-75 (temp sensor decided to break in half, then bad signal from the sensor convinced the PCU that it was -40 outside and it drowned the engine in gas)

- Bottle hurled from another car's window coming in mine and cracking me over the skull.  5 stitches in my scalp, fortunately didnt hit anything when I lost control of the car and spun out but I missed a pole holding up a road sign by about a foot.

- Airport lost my checked luggage with all Xmas presents for my family, they arrived back at my house in FL a week after xmas, all damaged.

- Sat at the gate for 5 hrs waiting on weather to take off before a 13 hr flight to Hawaii.  They wouldn't let us get off the plane.

You better believe that I drilled the properties of the 50 most common minerals (well, the 50 you're most likely to see on a given day) into my head, because if I didn't have that base of knowledge to pull from, I couldn't have even begun to analyze the samples that I was working with."

2066,"Not OP, but I've never experienced romantic feelings and have been thinking maybe I am a-romantic. On the flip side I romanticize about finding someone I'm attracted to and being in a relationship with them. It's all really confusing to me.

I've only ""fallen in love"" (so I think) with one person throughout my whole life but I never had the chance to express my feelings. Nobody I have met has kept my interest (thinking about said person at random times, other lovey dovey thoughts) long enough for me to be romantically attracted to them.

2074,"Not my birthday, but I was the only kid out of a class of 25 who didn't get invited to one kids birthday. It was kindergarten, and he got to stand at the front and call each kid up to get their invite. When it got to the end, and I hadn't received one, I put my hand up and pointed this out. He said he didn't like me and didn't want me to come. I cried, and my teacher tried to guilt trip him into inviting me.

At lunch, I was asked to stay back, and my teacher gave me a chocolate and this small magnifying glass toy"
2075,"Two weeks before my birthday, I invited two friend groups from school to come and join me for my 'birthday movie'. About 10 people had RSVP'd for the big day.

One week before the movie, those two groups got into a massive feud (for reasons I cannot remember). I wasn't a part of the feud, and I was still in contact with everyone via MSN (back when it was still a thing). I totally forgot about the feud when I was chatting to a friend about my birthday movie. The conversation went a bit like this:

Me: Hey, are you coming to my birthday movie?

Friend: Yeah, I'll be there.

Me: Great! Everyone else will be there too, like (Friend 1), (Friend 2) and (Friend 3).

Friend (who is in a feud with Friend 3): Wait, Friend 3 will be there?

Me: Uh...

And surely enough, all those who were feuding realised that their arch enemies would potentially be at my birthday movie.

Then came the day.

Both friend groups were civil enough to come greet me at the theatres and say happy birthday, though none of them were willing to actually come watch the movie with me. (I never blamed them. I would never force them to be in close proximity to the people they didn't like at the time. I was just sad that they were fighting.)

After they left, I was left with my then best friend and a guy in my class who I didn't invite, but I thought that he may as well come join me.

Before the movie, we explored our local mall and ended up having a blast! I had totally forgotten that my birthday event was almost a massive flop. I had so much fun with those two.

The movie we saw that afternoon was 'Up'. It changed my life and my two friends enjoyed it too.

So what could have potentially been a disastrous birthday turned into a day of fun with my best friend and a classmate I barely knew."

2107,"After 4 years of bullshit from an abusive partner, I couldn't take it anymore.

I was leaving for an international flight when I read a reddit post where someone said that if someone keeps trying to fight and belittle others for no reason other than ""Fun"", that person is a fucking psycho. 

That sounded like her. A LOT.

I called her and told her what I felt. I wanted her to be less of a conflict-loving person. I asked her to be calmer and more comprehensive. I asked her to stop fighting people on Facebook for the SOLE purpose of fighting people. I told her I knew she could do it if she put in the effort.

She told me to go fuck myself if I couldn't accept her for who she was.

I said ""Ok. "" And moved on.

I left for my international flight and arrived in Miami at about 5:00 AM. I was absolutely exhausted, but super hyped. My half-brother works in Miami as an MD, and as a Med Student I was incredibly happy that he was taking me to my first medical conference.... at 6:00AM. I didn't care that I was tired and aching all over because I'm too tall to have a comfortable nap during a plane trip (6'5""), so as long as I got to watch that conference.

After about 40 or so minutes, my phone starts ringing. Weird? It should be early af back at home.

It was her.

She woke up and wanted to fight again.

**Because I had asked her to be a calmer and more comprehensive individual.**

The first thing she did upon waking up was calling me to try and fight me. **Again.**

I got up, went outside and called her, laying upon her with a fury hell hasn't seen in a thousand years. Told her I was done being used and abused like a dog/puppet/moneybag. Told her I was not going to be controlled by her anymore. That I was going to live MY life, not hers. That I was going to go out with whatever friends I wanted to, for as long as I wanted to. Told her I could not take having to drive 40+ minutes EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. FOR. 4. YEARS. to visit her at her home when she didn't even bother to get her driver's license. Told her I was done having her shit talk and blame me for every bad thing that ever happened to her due to her own failures as an individual. Told her I would not be her scapegoat anymore. Told her she should be ashamed of being such an incredibly toxic and leech-like individual. Told her I was done dedicating unfathomable quantities of time to someone who would just take that for granted. Told her I loved her, but now I had realized it was because she had manipulated me into guilting myself into loving her.

It was liberating. I turned off my phone. Blocked her in every possible medium she could use to try and contact me.

I am now happy again, using no meds for depression and my scores have improved tremendously.

And yeah, I just checked her Instagram and she has a new Boyfriend who she met online. He lives 200 miles away from her. She has a picture **with him in her home**. The poor fucker doesn't know how much he's about to be taken advantage of.

Had us there for 3 hours and wouldn’t show us the exit and also had disorienting music on. I have a condition that makes me dizzy and anxious (PTSD and other medical issues) so after 3 hours I couldn’t take it and started sobbing. They rushed us out of there and gave us $200 gift card. Got us some new clothes and some drinks too.

I would have tilted, too. That's an incredibly stupid request for them to make of you and never would have held up before a judge.

2116,"Well, I've noticed it's almost like I've gotten ""less allergic to them"" the longer I've had cats. cleaning ALOT is a huge help. We have all wood floors so sweeping is easier to get alot of it up compared to carpet. Clean the furniture alot. Places they like to ""hang out"" /nap alot, we clean more than normal. Like the back of the couch by our front window, they like to sit there and sleep or look outside alot so we put a blanket on the couch back so we can just take it off and wash it frequently and replace it with a different one. 

I used to have alot of issues if they got near my face, but it's not so bad anymore. I just can't nuzzle them or anything or it's an instant eye itchy fit and sneeze fest.

If you can, borrow one? Or foster one temporarily or something. I'm not sure how severe your allergies to them are as everyone is different. But if you have friends with some, go to their house and see how you do. Especially if you have one who cleans alot and one who doesn't that'd show you both spectrums. 

All of our cats are short hair too, I can't speak for long hair or how I would do with them.

2119,"Because being a bus driver isn't a full-time job in a lot of places. You're only needed morning and afternoon and for the occasional day trip.

Wasn’t nearby, so we sat there.., but two minutes later she comes up and say “these are my seats.”

2164,"My comment was in response to damboy and military's statements, not OP. Damboy literally said ""if both parties are 11."" Both parties. As in, two. So no, I didn't make anything up.
  
Furthermore, we're not ""pretending"" that 11 year olds fucking is a thing that can happen. It's a thing that DOES happen. Obviously most people have sex much later but pretending it never happens doesn't make you less of a pedo. A quick google search will tell you that guys generally hit puberty between 12-16 years old, and girls earlier than that. A 1 year outlier from the average is far from impossible.  
  
Also, a side note to ""the impulse is not taught,"" LOTS of kids have experience with pornographic material at 11 years old. I certainly did, my 11 year old nephew who uses the computer all the time certainly has, other kids at school when I was a child certainly had, etc. We're no longer in the past where it's hard to access adult content.  
  
Children experiment. Sexual curiosity appears even before puberty, and sexual curiosity with sufficient knowledge leads to sex, simple as that.  
  
Finally, I don't know why you think this comment chain is some grand scheme for people to talk about children having sex. You can look through my comment history but I'm quite sure I've talked about this topic 0 times.

That was fall of 1979 and they didn't know a lot about how to treat it then other than to bombard you with radiation.  So I got full mantle radiation 5 days a week for about 3 or 4 months.  Plus had my spleen removed and 3 liver biopsies.  Burned up my heart and have dealt with scar tissue from the burns on my heart ever since.

At which (and to this day I am incredibly thankful for how convenient that this hospital was located directly in my city), I got referred to a dedicated cancer hospital, Roswell in Buffalo, NY and was finally diagnosed with Stage 4b Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

Get ready for cringe. Are you ready? You're not ready, but here goes. The wiring in my old place, it was special. It was an older place, no idea the year. Each 220 item we had had it's own breaker. Responsible, no doubt. And they were also cost efficient. VERY cost efficient. Those who came before didn't really believe that 220 was a huge necessity. So, they didn't want to spend a lot to get 220 service. How did they make up for this? By putting all of the 220 items in series. ""But I thought you said each one had it's own breaker"" - well apparently, the person who did it thought that sending a ground wire to the breaker was good enough. 

I apologize. I'm sure that was hard to read. But I must apologize again, because I need to tell you that the wiring was also aluminum, for the entire house, and the feeder wire^^? was no exception.

The fire happened because the 220 lines completely melted and ended up fusing with the 110 lines. It completely blew our breaker box and was tripped at the pole. 

So that's the story about how my friend got pissed off about me breaking his xbox and how my brother thought I caught his computer on fire by ""doing crazy shit"" on it."

2305,"From reading RoTK, I have determined that in the 300s the Chinese had only two emotions: stoic or loudly and outwardly sobbing."
2306,"My friend Tommy and I were just talking about this kid from camp recently.

A few years ago, Tommy and I were 15 and we got jobs as junior counselors (JCs were 15 and 16 years old) at the sleepaway camp we had been attending since we were 8.  The camp is for kids 8-14: 8-11 year olds in cabins, 12-14 year olds in cabins.  The juniors slept in the cabins with your group, while the counselors who were 17 and older shared cabins among themselves.  Tommy and I had adjacent cabins, and we each had a 12-14 group (all boys of course).  There were 10 kids in a group.

On the first day of camp, I was checking in kids as they got to camp and directing them to their cabins.  Tommy was up at our cabins getting the kids settled in as I sent them up.  Everything was going smoothly, the usual tears from some kids, tears from some parents, other parents obviously in a hurry to do a dump and run, etc.    A boy walks up to me and tells me his name is Jacob.  Jacob is new to camp, and I welcome Jacob and let him know how glad I am he is here.  And then Jacob tells me:

He's 12, he's an only child, and he doesn't have any pubic hair yet.  Jacob is telling me this because other boys might see him naked, and he doesn't want them to make fun of him.

Jacob also spoke in a weird monotone that made his revelations that much more creepy.

Jacob interprets my stunned silence as ""please continue"" because then he adds that when he masturbates, he gets the tickle feeling, but nothing comes out yet.  Oh     my     fucking     God.

Jacob asks about privacy / alone time because he knows he won't be able to go a week without masturbating.  What    is     fucking     going?

Jacob's parents did a dump and run and, rather than stay for the lunch for the parents, they took off to have lunch in a real restaurant.  I'm not surprised after my five minutes with Jacob.  I've said almost nothing up to this point, other than asking him if he spoke to any other counselors because now I'm convinced the others put him up to this as a joke on me.  Nope, this is Jacob in real life.

Since I now have a line of kids waiting to check in, I double check my clipboard and yes, Jacob will be in Tommy's cabin.  I tell Jacob where to go and that we'll talk later.  I have every intention of avoiding Jacob.

I finish checking kids in and go up to my cabin.  Tommy has been watching both cabins as the boys settle in.  I ask Tommy if he's spoken to Jacob yet.  Tommy said they had a small argument because Jacob didn't want to be in a bunk - he wanted the one single bed that was Tommy's.  I recounted my check in conversation with Jacob.  Tommy's only response is ""Fuck me, are you kidding!?""  Something about Jacob's creepy monotone and TMI make us think Jacob will be trouble.

Fast forward through the endless welcomes, orientations and tours to about 3:30pm.  Jacob told Tommy he doesn't like sports much because he doesn't like to be sweaty.  Now, Jacob walks over to me and Tommy and asks about a snack.  Since dinner is only about two hours away, we tell him he'll be fine and can wait.  Well, see, around 3:30-4pm, Jacob and his mother have tea and cookies.  Sometimes they have cheese and crackers, which he likes because mom has wine and he gets to drink seltzer out of a wine glass.  No snack.  Go back with the others.

So far, after only about five hours, we know Jacob doesn't like perspiration, observes high tea and needs a quiet place to jerk off his bald dick.  I'm still not convinced this isn't a joke.  If it is, Jacob is a future Oscar winner because this kid has some poker face.

After dinner, everyone was leaving the dining hall.  Jacob had something to say about the quality of the food, but Tommy told him to run along.  Tommy and I were walking back to the cabins, the boys had scattered, running ahead.  Chris, a 13 year old from Tommy's cabin, stops us.  I've known Chris for three years and I like him a lot.  He's exactly like the kid Tanner from The Bad News Bears.  Chris says,

""Hey, what's with that kid Jacob?""

""Why?""

""Weirdo is asking me about my pubes.  Is he gay?""

Great, there's a rumor we need.  Tommy gets as far as, ""Look, Chris...""

Chris says, ""I don't care if he's a 'mo, but he can't be doing weird shit in the cabin.  Tell him he can be weird in the woods.""

""He's not doing anything weird...""

""Asking guys about their dick hair is weird.""  13 year old Chris has a point.

I remind Tommy that at some point, Jacob has made it clear he is going to jerk off.  So am I.  So is Tommy.  So are the other 19 boys in our cabins.  But Jacob doesn't seem to have the filter or the boundaries to be discrete about it.  Lots of guys have gotten busted for that, usually in a comical way.  But Jacob is different.

Before the campers arrived, part of the counselors' training involved handling sexual matters.  Tommy decided (and I agreed) as a cover our asses move, we were going to partner with a senior counselor.  Let the senior have a long talk with Jacob.

Our section was four cabins and a bathroom/shower.  Tommy and I worked out in advance with the other two JCs that if they took our kids and theirs to the big field at 6:30 so that Tommy and I could grab a shower, we would relieve them at 7 so they could grab one.    It was a way to get away from the kids and shower in peace.  The bathroom portion was separated from the shower portion by a large common room / changing room.  Unfortunately, privacy was non existent because the shower was a large community shower room with shower heads along the wall.  The room was pretty big - a whole cabin could shower at once.  Modesty goes out the window pretty quickly in a shower situation like that.  Eh, Tommy and I have been friends forever.

So Tommy and I hit the shower.  We were joking around, taking our time.  Tommy was facing the wall, his back to the door.  I was facing the door, leaning my head back to rinse out shampoo.  I put my head down and there, standing in the doorway is Jacob, a towel around his waist.  What     the     fuck     is with this kid?!

I slap Tommy on the arm and he turns around.  Jacob is just staring.  At least he was looking us in the eyes and not staring at our pubic hair.

Jacob points in the direction of the bathroom part.  ""I don't go number two at school.  I can only go at home.  I don't know if I'll be able to use that bathroom.""

""Jacob, why are you here?!""  Tommy was pissed.

""I thought I should shower with you because you won't make fun of me.""   Are you sure about that, Jacob?

How did he even know we were in here?  We didn't tell the kids where we were - we told them to stay with the other counselors.  The kids could not have cared less where we were.  Except Jacob, apparently.

""Jacob, you need to go play whatever the others are playing.""

""But I've already taken off my clothes and I'm ready for a shower.""  A Mexican stand off.

So Tommy and I haul our wet, naked asses into the changing room to dry off and get dressed.  Tommy allows Jacob to shower now.  And as a parting shot, before he disappears into the shower room, Jacob asks Tommy if he can watch him shave his face the next time he does it.  Jacob has never seen a guy shave because his father locks the bathroom door.

Day one is only just winding down.

The next morning I asked Tommy about Jacob.  9 boys sleep in boxers, gym shorts, t-shirts.  Jacob sleeps in old man pajamas (a shirt that buttons up the front and has a breast pocket).  He brought, but didn't use, a bathrobe and slippers (fur lined Ugg slippers).  Jacob told Tommy that if he gets a sunburn, Tommy would have to apply aloe to the parts he can't reach.  And then Jacob shows Tommy the aloe - it's a bag of actual aloe leaves that Tommy would have to squeeze the gel from.  Tommy also said that Chris kept telling him, ""Weird shit!  Get it straightened out!"" to the point Tommy thinks he may have to trade Chris for one of my campers (fine with me).

And that was the start of a long week with Jacob.

2308,"While I do believe Johnny Depp is a drunk and probably a druggie as well, I don't believe the story with Amber Herd. It's very fishy, as other's have said it was all very ""he said, she said"", and Amber apparently has a history of being emotionally abusive and manipulative herself. Vanessa Paradis, Depp's ex and mother of his kids, even came out in defence of Depp and said that while Depp does have issues, being abusive is not one of them. And this is the lady Depp cheated on with Amber and left Amber for, you would think she would have a grudge there to not come out in defence of the guy who cheated on her after a good 15 years or so together. The whole thing was odd and we may never know the full truth. "

After the crawl was over and everyone was sufficiently sloshed, we went to a strip club but didnt know it was amateur night. Of course both my FWB and the other girl got on stage with everyone else yelling and clapping. They both did their dances at the same time, took of their tops, played with each other, and flashed their bottoms but didnt take off their shorts. It was hot, I admit.

I was the sole care giver for her.  She was 57 and I was 52, we were married 19 years, five kids between us, none together.  I gave up my job, and basically my career, to take care of her.  I have no regrets.

The grief didn’t hit me until six months later.  After I’d sold the house and relocated and all the related things that go with that.  It was like hitting a brick wall.  I felt empty and lost.  I was always someone’s rock and then I needed a rock.  No one was there for me.  So I sought counseling and joined a grief support group.  It helped immensely.  

And speaking only for myself, time heals.  I think of her often and the fourth anniversary of her passing is six weeks away.  I’ve been thinking about her more.  The anniversary of specific dates, and especially holidays are becoming better for me.

I’m doing fine now.  As a way to honor her memory,  I volunteer as a driver for the American Cancer Society by driving patients to and from appointments.  It feels good to help others and it’s a way to pay it forward.

If I can be of any assistance to you, or answer any questions, I’m glad to help.  It’s healing for me to talk about my story.

All of their belongings were left at home and no clues have panned out as to what happened to them. There were billboards asking for information in town for years after the disappearance which is why the case is so widely known about in the area."
2362,"I'm sorry for your losses. I have a similar-ish story, though, too.

My maternal grandmother bought me a blanket-bear (has a head and floppy arms but is basically all baby blanket) that at some point I named Sleepy Bear. I slept with her every night - as a baby my parents could jokingly lay me on top of her - and carried her pretty much everywhere as a little kid. In elementary school I stopped taking her everywhere but continued to have her at least next to me in bed, if not in my arms, for years (and counting). When I was a preteen, my mom died, and I made one of my best friends bring her to church for the funeral. 

The only time I didn't have her was when I went to a wilderness program in high school - I originally was going to insist, but then the director was telling me that anything we couldn't stand to either ruin or lose shouldn't go with us, and I just couldn't bear to risk it. Those three months had some difficult nights, though, curled up in a sleeping bag while she was back at home (tucked into my bed, because I asked my dad to do that). Even when sleeping over at significant others' houses, I've brought her along. 

At 23, I don't hold her while sleeping anymore because at some point I started sleeping on my stomach instead of my side and I can't kick that habit, but she's always next to me and I'm pretty sure she always will be. She's a connection to a mother, grandmother, and an entire side of my family that I've lost, and she's family, too.

I hope Blue stays with you as well and continues to be a source of comfort.

2521,"&gt; Another context-specific exception involves cheating. If one of the partner's cheats, I think the other partner is fair to say that the relationship can't continue as long as the cheat-ee is around. But again, the context is not ""You're not allowed to see him/her,"" but ""Hey, I want to make this work, but I'm hurt, and it is very hard to trust you right now given what happened. To help facilitate reparation of our relationship, it would mean a lot to me if you stopped talking to him/her while we figure things out. I don't think we can make it work if you continue to talk to him though.""

I think that if you've been cheated on, it's 100% ok to just say flat out, ""No you're not allowed to be around that person anymore.""  Cheating at all is generally seen as a deal breaker in itself, and if the person being cheated on is willing to give their significant other another shot, they can insist on something that would be unreasonable in another context.

Edit to add: The difference in this case is that if the other partner is unwilling to go along with the demand, they can assume the relationship is over."

2533,"Here's another dose from France. Two memes, even !

First one comes from last year. It came from a moderately-well known talkshow where guests are ordinary people, coming to share their experiences about the day's given subject. This edition's subject was ""irrational phobias"", and this blondie was *extremely* afraid of roaches. So when the hosts and onboard psychologist tried to confront her (gently enough) to her fear, insisting she needed to come to terms with it, she let out ""Je suis pas venue ici pour souffrir, ok ?!"" (""I didn't come here to suffer, alright?!""). Her nasal delivery made it an instant classic, and was only exacerbated by her attempts to trademark it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QglFGVDcuX8

Then a fresh meme right off the press, another talkshow was talking about sexism in the workplace and misrepresentation of females and colored people. The host is a nice old gent who notes it's kind of a shame his guests are 30-something men. Then a bald dude with a short beard immediately rebuffs him with ""Qu'est-ce qui vous fait dire que je suis un homme ?"" (""What makes you say I'm a man?"").

Confusion was abound. But then, the host attempted a save by talking about the absence of colored people, and right out of the gate, asked Not!Dude if he was going to debate it.

Cue ""Non, je suis à moitié libanais"" (""No, I'm half-lebanese"").

But speaking of poking, TAGS. A lot of people know this one though, so don’t need to go into it very much. Basically, I’d rather something be poking my sides and shoulders than the bottom of my neck &amp; top of my spine.

As for backwards? Honestly, I don’t know that one, I never did it. That’s as mysterious to me as it is to neurotypical researchers, haha.

2666,"You’re not wrong about a lot of the stuff you listed, but let people have fun! No reason to judge someone if they pick a guitar up in a store and play right away. Everyone is at a different level musically and can play whatever they want when searching for a new instrument. As long as a guitar is properly maintained ( although many stores don’t take care of their instruments as well as they should ), you should be able to pick up any instrument and play anything you want. I really don’t agree that there is a “proper” way to test a guitar. A lot of younger players and beginners may be too intimidated to plug in and play in front of a busy store. If you work in a store that sells any kind of instrument, set the customer up and let them do their thing, it’s them buying it in the end.

99% of the time I am telling people this stuff because I don't feel like getting a call at 6:30 on a Saturday Night, having to drive for 45 minutes to replace an air filter because you didn't listen to anything I said.

The only time I get irritated is when someone is *too close*. If I am bumping into you every time I stand up, give me some space.

What I will tell you do is clean up your shit. A trades person is bound to be more annoyed when he has to move your belongings to work on that appliance, hot water tank or furnace.

Seriously. You called us a week and a half ago to make an appointment for that new furnace. If I have to become a mover, to get all those boxes of toys/clothes/dildos/dead bodies out of my way....I am usually irritated when I am doing it.

Also if you're worried about your house being ""dirty"", it probably isn't compared to what we've dealt with in the past. You're aware of the ""dirt"". The people that are living in filth usually aren't aware of it. They don't see it as a problem.

Edit: Most of the companies I have worked for have a drug policy. If you see drug paraphernalia we can cancel the call and leave. If your house smells like Febreeze and Weed, I could technically cancel the call. I probably won't. If I run across a meth lab down by your furnace, I'm outtie. "

2741,"Worked inner city middle school and checked buses in every morning.  There was some neighborhood drama starting to brew with 2-3 different families involved, about 15 kids total and of course they all ride the same bus.  Bus pulls in one morning and there is a parent following the bus in her car.  Apparently there was a threat of a huge fight and rather than just bring their children to school the mom put the kids on the bus and followed it.  Come to find out the driver had stopped once already to calm the kids down, and called the school.  Our resource officer was notified as we we’re getting in her car to go meet the bus when they suddenly pulled up.  20 kid brawl happening and only two of us there to break it up.  As we are getting on the bus to break it up, the mother following the bus gets on and starts beating the shit out of a kid.  We finally get the non-fighters off the bus and the families separated .  The mother who got on  the bus starts screaming at the resource officer and I,  “You are supposed to make school safe and ain’t doing shit!”  She said she was going to press charges on us and grabbed her kids and left.  Our resource officer followed her to the police station and immediately arrested her for child endangerment and assaulting a minor. "

2743,"These are the 3 essential books for playing. Players Handbook(PHB) is all the basics for creating characters. It also has a begginer friendly introduction section. Dungeon master's guide(DMG) is the basics for story and environment. Monster Manual (MM)is basically a long list of baddies the DM can use as enemies(or allies in some cases) for the players, complete with all the applicable stats for each. Any books past these 3 are just extra tools for the PCs/DM to use.
I personally would recommend a playgroup to have a single copy of the DMG and MM and at least half as many copies of the PHB as there pare players. You can get by with one, but (especially at character creation time) it can be tedious and time consuming to pass around. Additionally you really only need one of any given supplemental book."

A lot of the main voice actresses were established names that have their own fanbases), and the show was well-written enough that people were intrigued and invested instead of immediately repulsed. Add in a good music team and people were hooked. It's not a flawless show, but it struck a chord with a lot of people (and 4chan decided that ponies were perfect faces for their shenanigans, which bloated the fandom even more.)"

2751,"With Travellers it's complex. There's a huge mistrust of the State and any State institutions - which is entirely mutual as well. Traveller kids do not do well in school, generally. Teachers disproportionately punish them for starters, and they do tend to get in fights a lot. Both because they're quite rough to start with, and also because nobody likes Travellers and children aren't kind. It's always considered to be their fault, though, no matter who starts it. And this is just Settled Travellers - if they're still actually Travelling, that makes attending the same school quite complex too.

My neighbour is Settled, of course, which is why he's a neighbour and not just someone who moved through. Pretty much all our other neighbours stopped talking to us when they saw that we were having these Travellers over for tea and welcoming them into the area. If you don't like Traveller culture, though, shouldn't that mean you *want* them to Settle?"

Crouched and watching me from the side. Red eyes, like the spot a laser is coming from on a cheap  laser pointer. Watching me. I was terrified and couldn't look away, I was fixated on the eyes. I would say he was about 12-15 feet away. Eventually I think I just passed out from exhaustion, and I knew I'd seen someone refer to something like this before.

2933,"People are afraid of the pain that may come with dying. Dying... everybody dies, no one gets out of here alive. 

So unless you've been raised with specter of Divine Punishment, which occurs *only* after you're dead and have no means of repenting or rectifying the ""evil"" you did before you died, there's no reason to fear death. 

And if you believe that God is the kind of entity that will torture you for all eternity after death... well, what kind of god would even *do* that? How is that not a demon? We know why your minister is preaching that shit - gotta get a new jet paid out of the tithe - but why are you buying it? Are you that much of a toady, lickspittle parishioner? Why are you worshipping what is - objectively - a murderous, cruel, sadistic tyrant? I mean, if you met someone who tortured disobedient animals for fun, you'd have the creep locked up, right?

At any rate, those believers are NOT really afraid of death. They are afraid of their God, and who can blame them?

So no, death isn't scary. *Getting* dead can be. It helps if you've almost been killed a couple of times. Old soldiers realize that the years of their lives that extend beyond their service is a bonus. 

Me, I feel lucky my end has been put off for so long - I got to meet my grandkids. Nice. I don't feel like I was owed those years. I have memories of just how close a thing it was. Pretty damned close. The benefit of close call is that every day I am alive passes like a gift of undeserved grace and bounty. I was lucky. More deserving people - some I knew personally - were not. It ain't fair, but there it is.

2939,That’s because depressed is an emotion and depression is a condition. Everybody feels depressed now and then. Literally everybody. (Most) People aren’t trying to conflate it with chronic depression. Since people have become more open with mental illnesses a sentiment has arose that if you feel depressed without chronic depression or feel anxious without an anxiety disorder then you’re faking it and making it worse for people with those conditions. That’s not true. Those are basic human emotions.

What the fuck happened to Lily's Army? Why would they believe Dorian, and if they believed him, how did he not get dismembered as a response?

Seemed to me that they were gearing up to pull an early Pratchett, and have two unrelated plotlines converge at the end - Lily would have her emotions purged as the men intended, leaving her a cold-blooded, logical killing machine. The fight against Dracula would be looking really, really bad. Lily's Army would sweep in, slicing up vampires left, right and centre, and she would face him down as the one person he can't emotionally manipulate because she has no emotions. He wouldn't realise until much too late,  she would calmly and considerately dispatch him, and the world would be saved.

What they did was just so pointless. And intensely disappointing."
2974,"My parents married at 25. They had my brother at 30 and me at 33. They divorced when I was 1 and remarried when I was 3. I think my mom cheated on my dad. I could be wrong though. Growing up, I remember hearing bits and pieces about it but I never asked. 

When I was a teenager, my parents fought like crazy. I decided to come home from college one day unannounced to find my mom moved out. They were getting a divorce and didn’t tell me. 

The second time was from fighting over money. My mom gambled a lot and supposedly gambled away money for my brother’s college education. 

My dad has been happily with a new woman for six years now. My mom remarried two more times to lame guys. 

Now that I’m an adult, I see that the problem was my mother. I do believe she has a mental illness, possibly bipolar disorder. 

I love them both, they are good people. I’m happy that as an adult I see that I have a good role model in my dad and I hope to avoid going down my mother’s path in relationships and handling situations.

2998,"My situation is a bit different, my brother, my sister’s twin, died 20 years ago from complications with Down Syndrome. I don’t ever remember that being an issue between all of us because of his health problems. They ultimately changed that dynamic. The only time I can remember their twin status mattering is right after he passed. I turned 11 only 5 days before he passed. Not long after his passing I was struggling coping and trying to help my family cope anyways due to my personality. Then, someone close to me told me that I needed to let my family grieve because that was my dad’s only son and my mom spent his whole life caring for him and it was my sisters twin. I struggled grieving even more after that because I thought I had to hold my family together because I was **just** his sister. It was the only time in my life I ever felt their twinness made me an outsider. Once I was an adult I got counseling on that issue...but  it really hurt for something that I had never felt make me an outsider before.

Heh.  My university had the opposite rule.  You couldn't live off-campus unless you were more than thirty minutes away OR you were a resident of the town.  I fucking hated dorm life and saw an ad for an apartment that was a single and a third less than the dorm so I talked to the landlord and we did a gentleman's handshake and boom, a week later I'm living there.

I went to city hall and asked how I could become a resident of their town and they raised an eyebrow and asked if I were a student and I said yes, but I never go home and live here all year round, so I want to be a formal resident so I can vote since for all practical purposes I'm already one anyway.  They had me sign this form saying I lived there and away I go to the university.

The university decided to one-up me because fuck you why not because we want your dorm room money so they call my grandparents.  Assholes.  The university, not my grandparents.  My grandparents were surprisingly FURIOUS that I moved off campus and I swear they were going to disown me or something until they saw my apartment.

My grandfather simply said ""wow, this is better than my first apartment ever was"" and my grandmother was shocked at how much cheaper it was than the dorms.  My grandfather called the university and yelled at them for wasting his time when my apartment was clearly superior to their dorm.

The fact that your ex ends up dating someone of the opposite gender to you when you break up is irrelevant. You broke up. It has no bearing on you who they date after that.

Now, it can't share 100% of your genes, because it will need a different sex chromosome, but it will still be more closely related to you than any traditional sibling could be.

But that's just what makes it incestuous. What keeps it from being masturbation is that you don't share your consciousness. And you can't; Sharing a consciousness would necessitate sharing your perceptions, and the human brain is not built to handle the signals from two bodies in different locations like that. You'd have a massive seizure and either die or suffer severe and permanent brain damage. Since you can't share your consciousness, you can't really be the same being, so having sex can't be masturbation."

They had a employee rating system where groups of around 20 employees are kept in a group and each one is rated 1+, 1, 2, 3 and 4 which determines the increment. If you are rated 4 you are fired. The basic flaw in this methodology is the implementation that they predetermined that what % of participants of the group will get each rating .  That each group will have 5% of 1+(who gets promoted) and 10% of 1s, 40% of 2s, 40% of 3s and 5% of 4s. So a bunch of idiots in a group would still have 1 of them getting 1+. Or a perfectly good team will still have 1 of them fired.

One night a bunch of us were drinking and as I was walking past him he slightly passed his hand along my penis. I continued walking but threw him a ""wtf"" type of stare as I looked back. I figured the message was received.

Then just this weekend we're out and I ended up having a little too much so I started chugging water and decided to lie down to rest for ten minutes so that I'd be able to get home safely.

3147,"I don't know all the details because I was young - there were some things I asked about and got told I didn't need to know. (Bullshit - please don't do that to your kids.)

&amp;#x200B;

At the ferry port we got whisked off to a back room and sat down while someone got hold of our mother (this was slightly pre-mobile) and she drove out. The staff were nice, I think people were a bit on edge but I remember someone giving my sister a colouring book. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days later a policewoman came to the house to talk to us, I didn't get told at the time ""She's taking a statement"" but there was a lot of ""and what happened then?"" and when she'd finished writing things down she kept going back and asking the same things. They did talk briefly to my sister but she was 6 so I don't know how useful.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding of the legal side is that they couldn't ""prove"" attempted kidnapping - this was the 90s so we were on his passport rather than him having taken our passports or anything. So the argument was that I'd freaked out over nothing (Even though he'd been asking repeatedly about us wanting to come live with him, and talking about how much we'd love Germany and all that kind of thing.) I know he got done for hitting the security guard and got fined/put on some kind of order (probation?). Does make me wonder if he \*should\* have been leaving the country right after but I don't think it's a big deal enough charge for anyone to care. (Someone might correct me on that - I want to say he was argued down from ABH to battery but I might be getting that wrong? Most of that comes from evesdropping rather than anyone telling me anything directly except that he was going back home and I should start writing to him again.)

&amp;#x200B;

He went back home, and that side of the family was pretty cold as us about ""raising a fuss"". It's that kind of family, a lot of things were covered up with ""Don't raise a fuss"", or ""Don't air your dirty linen in public"". Sure, so-and-so-might be beating his wife again, but she's at fault for letting people know about it, that kind of thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

It did freak me out for quite a while - there was enough of an age gap between me and my sister that she went to a different school and I spent the whole time convinced she was going to get snatched at the gates or something. I'd already spent a long time being ""the responsible adult"" for the kids around a pack of drunks, this definitely pushed me over into neurotic. 

&amp;#x200B;

...bit of a novel there. This was twenty years ago, I hadn't really thought of how much it had screwed me up at the time. Mostly now it's just one of those semi-funny things, ""I got slightly kidnapped, and that's why I don't let other people plan days out"", but I guess that's kind of fucked up."

3192,"Palliative care in general is the care given to people who are at their end of their lives.  Usually in hospice this takes the form of making people comfortable, giving the best quality of life possible, and managing pain in other symptoms so that they can comfortably die how they choose.  In the case of cancer though often times people will be given chemo as a form of palliative care.  Basically you guaranteed to die in the end, the doctors feel there is zero chance of you actually recovering.  So this basically means your quality of life will be absolute garbage for the last few months until you die, but you might get a little more time out of it.

Likewise chemo is dangerous, especially for people who are knocking on deaths door.  I've heard doctors flat out say I've never seen cancer kill someone, but I've seen chemo kill plenty of people.  That in and of itself would actually be fine to offer patients as an option.  You have two months, we might be able to make it three but you might be so ill that you never get to actually enjoy them or you may die sooner because the treatment is aggressive.  Often it's not given as an option though, because patients often times are never told what their status is.  They are often unaware their care is palliative at all and they're oncologists will basically just schedule them for palliative chemo the same way a doctor might schedule you for an x-ray.  Most patients don't know to question it so they lose the last of their lives laying in bed, unable to hold anything down, and eventually dying to their treatment."

3228,"That's the funny thing though. When the show first came out in 2009 (?) it was a godsend for me. I'd just spent the entirety of my teenage years being a total nerd surrounded by social circles of sporty cool people who I had such a hard time connecting with. They were nice and I still love those people to death, but we just weren't on the same wavelength. I didn't really have anyone to talk to about my love of Star Trek or my ""read every book about physics and quantum mechanics just for fun"" phase. I felt embarrassed by my love of the internet and my interest in rpg games and all that. Etc.

Then, the Big Bang Theory showed up and I started watching it. As an 18/19 year old starting college and trying to get a grasp on my identity, it was so fucking enjoyable to see total nerds being awkward and nerdy in a TV show and talking about subjects I was actually interested in. I didn't even think it was that funny most of the time, but I still liked it. Seeing it gave me a little boost of confidence to just accept that I'm a total fucking dork and it doesn't have to be weird to like the things I like. It was a good message to start college with, and I finally found the social circles that I could fit into because I stopped trying to vibe with the cool kids.

The show eventually got pretty annoying, so I stopped watching it. But the first couple of seasons hit me at just the right time and it'll always have a little place in my heart."

3271,"Since Phil is his own grandfather (he did the nasty in the pasty), Yancy Sr never knew his own biological father. Grandma Fry told Yancy that Enos Fry (her fiance) was his father, but he was killed in a nuclear blast. There is a predestination paradox at work and Grandma Fry probably just lied to Yancy to cover her one night stand (a big deal in that era).

So I'd guess the 'Yancy' name either skipped a generation then, and Enos' father was called Yancy, or perhaps more likely, he took the tradition from his mother's side as his father was absent from his childhood. Indeed the clip acttually says *'named Yancy, like me, and my* **grandfather,** *and so on, right back to Minuteman Yancy Fry who fought commies in the Civil War'*.

So it may be Grandma Fry's father who was the last Yancy, which actually makes sense too because it would have been Grandma Fry who named him, after he was born, as she was a single mother."

3281,"Because abstraction is one of the most important and powerful tools of mathematics.

Instead of learning how to solve a real life problem, it's more powerful to learn how to abstract the real life problem, solve the abstract problem and transform the abstract solution to your real life.

This way, when you abstract a different real life problem, you might end up with an abstract problem you know how to solve, and you see connections between things you didn't even consider.

Working in that abstract problem space takes training, and you need to get comfortable with it.

For example, if all you ever did was thinking in terms of ""how many apples does each of my friends get"", you would easily be able to answer the same question for bananas; but you might struggle with the question ""how long will it take me to arrive at my destination in my car"", because you don't realize that both problems can be abstracted to a simple division problem."

3311,"Oooo! I have a story! My friend’s band toured with his band (30 Seconds to Mars). He (my friend) was at his merch table when Jared came out to do a signing 1 table over. Some girl gets her autograph, walks away from Jared’s table, passes my friend’s table and he (my friend) vaguely over hears “something, something Jordan Catalano,” and my friend thinks to himself, “dude, I know him. I KNOW that name.”

So my friend and his bandmates rotate who watched their own merch table (mind you this is like right around the start of the 30 Seconds to Mars craze forever ago) and as his lead singer comes to the table for his turn, my friend was like, “do you know Jordan Catalano?” and he’s like, “I so know that name... who is that?” and this happens RIGHT after Jared has finished his autograph signing for everyone with wristbands, just as he got up to leave his merch table, passing behind my friend’s, and he was like, “what did you fucking say?” and my friend, super stunned, was like, “uhh... do you know Jordan Catalano?” Jared stormed off, and that night 30 Seconds’ manager informed my friend’s band that they were no longer allowed to LOOK at Jared, much less speak to him. 2 days later, they got kicked off the tour.

So, if you haven’t googled Jordan Catalano yet, that would be Jared Leto’s character on My So Called Life. What a prick."

3362,"It's hard to describe that in a Reddit post, but the island is a real place that the passengers of Oceanic 815 crashed on. Long before that, a woman with seemingly god-like abilities watched over and protected the island. Another girl have birth to two children. She wasn't expecting twins so she only had a name for Jacob. The ""other"" twin (man in Black) killed the mother and the ""good"" powers were given to Jacob. Jacob tried to kill his brother, but since the mother didn't allow them to hurt each other, he could only throw him into the well of light that they were supposed to protect. This turned MiB into the smoke monster, which gave him the ability to also possess the bodies of dead people on the island. 

Other weird things can be attributed to the Dharma Initiative. A science research company who ultimately found a high amount of radioactive activity. They were responsible for all of the hatches, food, and much more. I'm unsure if it's the radioactive activity or not that gives others on the island special powers. For instance, Locke is cured of his spinal injury that left him in a wheelchair, Rose is cured of her cancer, Jin was able to produce a baby with Sun. On the flip side, those without ""good"" tendencies have the opposite problem. Ben was frustrated that his tumor was growing while everyone else was getting cured. Also not sure about Walt, who seemed to have some supernatural powers, but those may have been before he ever got to the island.

One thing worth mentioning, all the survivors of the flight were ""touched by Jacob"" at one point in their lives. Sawyer when his mom and dad died, Jin and Sun at their wedding, and so on. This led to them being ""candidates"" to replace Jacob, but may or may not have had anything to do with the powers given by the island.

So in summary, the island is real and the events that took place actually happened in their real on Earth lives. That's why the ending goes on to explain that ""whatever happened, happened"" as some were having troubles wrapping their minds around the whole alternative timeline afterlife thing.

It can help everyone feel like they fit in and it may improve learning/grades to be more dressed up. A teacher told me about a study on that, but I never verified it. 

One bad thing that I can think of is a psychological reason. If everyone is dressed alike, they may feel like they are anonymous or hard to identify. When people blend in, bad behaviors can become more prevalent. "

But yeah that's the thing. I do it too. Been working on mine probably fifteen plus years, just not necessarily in the same places. I tended to listen to music and pace around my room a lot as a kid ( r/raisedbynarcissists ) and I've tried to turn that in a healthier direction as an adult and go on walks when I do it, because it was Maladaptive Daydreaming for a long time and I actually couldn't stop. I felt antsy if I didn't pace and world build at least once a day, often for hours at a time.

 I literally had to be broken of it by circumstances (moved into my FIL's house and has no room to pace but still tried) and now I only give in to the want if I can go outside and be healthy about it. "
3382,"This one was pretty wild. Bloomington is such a party town and that whole situation made carefree college drinking a little more ominous, for me anyway. I was wearing flip flops one night at Kilroy’s (Sports IIRC) and took them off for a second in the sand and the friend I was with made a remark about Lauren doing that. I didn’t know her but she was a friend of a friend.

3402,"My mother was a police explorer in the 80s. She later went on to being a 911 dispatcher. She had to do a ride along as part of Police Explorers or Dispatch training, can't remember.

The town she lived in has lots of gravel roads. On a blistering and muggy Iowa Summer, the Ambulance gets called to a motorcycle crash. There were speeding down the gravel and he was wearing shorts, sandals and no helmet. He was litteraly pasted across the gravel which acted like sand paper. His head split open and his brains were scattered like a Gallagher show and the smell is something my mom says she can still smell when she tells the story. Gently cooking brains in gravel mixed with the road dust and raw meat smell. Didn't help it was super humid to.

The girl riding with him lost 80% of her skin and broke basically everything. She died in the hospital before her parents got there. My mom made me swear to never ride motorcycles.

Edit: Riding leathers aren't a fucking fashion statement, so unless you want to force some traumatized 20 year old to scrape your face meat off the road with a garden spade, wear the proper riding gear and helmet."

You don’t hate the snake oil, or the people who buy it.  You get angry at the snake oil salesman who harms people for his own gain.  The complication comes when the snake oil salesman truly believes that their product is good for the world.  Is it their fault for selling lies to people, even if they believe the lies?  I would argue that it is, if the information that it’s a lie is readily available to them.

I told the dispatcher as much and he said: ""No worries. I see you at *roadname*. What's your reason for calling? He then proceeded to gather all the relevant information, dispatch police, ambulance and doctor and transfer my call to the aforementioned doctor. The doctor made a few enquiries regarding the state of the driver and said said they were on their way. Before he hung up, I asked if he was able to provide an ETA, as we were pretty far out from the city and I wasn't able to communicate with the drunk dude. ""Let me check...  I see the ambulance is on *roadname* and should be with you in two minutes or so."" I thanked him, hung up the phone and less than a minute later, I saw blue lights illuminate the sky in the distance, approaching at speed.

Less than 5 minutes after the call, paramedics, a doctor and police were on scene, so however they tracked me that night, it definitely made a difference.

Then a bunch more would start shushing the shushers and it would just snowball like this until the buzzer went off.

ETA: Another unintended effect was that, once we hit three buzzers, we all knew we wouldn't be going to recess that day so we would just shrug our shoulders and proceed to make as much noise as we wanted for the rest of the lunch period cuz fuck it."

3552,"Made me think of a weirdish memory I have. The last time my mom gave me a bath, I was like 12. I'm trying to remember why it happened. I had been showering alone for years. I think it had something to do with how tangled and ridiculous my hair got; like she was trying to make sure I was actually conditioning it or something. And I'm pretty sure she only helped wash my hair and maybe my back; I was always told to wash my private areas myself, even when I was little.

It was weird because I was too old for it and wasn't comfortable with it. But I'm 100% sure my mom was just being a helicopter parent and not trying to be creepy. I'm the oldest, so maybe she just was having trouble handling me growing up and had a lapse of boundaries as a result. Plus that would've been around the time my youngest sibling started showering on her own, so maybe she just felt a little unneeded.

It was only suppose to be her boyfriend. 
It was midnight and i needed to be up by 6am. I said hey if you can just keep noise down I'm heading to bed. Also please be mindful of my desk, my work stuff is on there. 

What they did instead: 

* wrestled around like 2 brothers play fighting which pissed off the downstairs neighbor who spent the rest of the night banging on their ceiling/my floor. Then submitted noise complaints and filed a complaint with the housing manager. 

*her boyfriend then invited several of his friends over and all of them were in and out of our tiny apartment all night slamming doors, fucking around on the balcony, and stomping up and down the communal hallway stairs. 

*they smoked weed in the living room and spilled bong water everywhere. Then left it to soak into my fucking carpet and furniture. 

*got a ton of fast food and instead of throwing out left overs/wrappers and trash they left it all over my desk, ruined my paperwork for work and left ring stains on my nice wood desk. Then they spilled MORE shit on the WHITE carpet and proceeded to spill drinks and spit bottles all over my nice wooden coffee table. Which they all made ZERO attempts at cleaning or mopping up. 

*ALL OF THEM put their feet on my coffee table and roughhoused on or near it enough to not only scratch the hell out of the top of the table, but completely splintered a leg and left it wobbly, water logged and scratched.  

*managed to completely ruin a spot in the fabric of the couch. It looked like it had been stabbed. 

*broke some of my cups/dishes. I don't know how

*screaming/yelling/loud music ALL NIGHT

*trash was found stuffed INTO and under the couch. 

*they drank all of the drinks in the fridge. Milk, soda, water bottles. Didnt matter it was gone. AFTER I JUST BOUGHT IT. 

*then after running around in his car awhile he backed his shitty bmw INTO my car, and sat there with his exhaust pipe directly against my car. It left a lovely burn/scratch and left exhaust all over my goddamn car because his backfires non stop. When I lost my unholy shit finally he called me a cunt and claimed it was ""just a joke! Calm down!"" That burn mark/scratch rusted over that winter and fucked up even more of my car.

So there's a widely reported factoid that every year, the average human being consumes eight spiders while they (the human, not the spiders) are sleeping. Apparently, we're supposed to believe that spides see the warm, dark opening of our dozing mouths and hop right in, just in time for us to swallow them down in a single gulp. This sounds horrifying, and rightly so, but when you think about it it doesn't make *that* much sense. A quick google search will send you to Snopes, where [it's roundly debunked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spiders-inside-her/). Furthermore, Snopes goes on to state that the origin of the myth was a 1993 article in a magazine named PC Professional, where writer Lisa Holst set out to prove how easy it was to spread disinformation online. She included a list of facts that were completely made up, cited a page in a random book on entomology, and left it to spread -- and boy, did it ever. The false-flag fact soon ended up all over the damn place.

So job done. Story debunked. Myth busted.

*Except...*

Well, except for the fact that she's not real. In all the years since, no one has been able to track down this aforementioned article. No one has been able to get in touch with Lisa Brigit Holst, the alleged writer of the piece. No one has been able to find a magazine entitled PC Professional that was in print at the time and had a record of its publication.

Lisa Birgit Holst, by the way, is an anagram of **THIS IS A BIG TROLL**.

So what's the story here? Did Snopes get bamboozled? Almost certainly not. Because they seem to be the progenitor of the whole Lisa Holst debate, it's likely that Snopes is using that article as [a fictitious entry designed as a copyright trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry). These aren't unheard of, by any means. Encyclopaedias used to use them, and mapmakers would often include what became known as 'trap streets' or 'paper town' -- an old cartographer's trick wherein they'd put a village or street that didn't exist on a map, so that you could easily prove copyright infringement (the idea being that if someone else copied your map rather than going out and surveying the land themselves, they'd include the fake town along with it)."

3695,"“.... TO MAKE AN *EMERGENCY* HEAD CALL!!”

as soon as the words left my mouth, two things happened. 1) i knew immediately i would not be making that head call and 2) my colon cramped and sent me to my knees. at this point i was internally begging god to either release me from this demon or pull my soul from the tortured shell it currently resided in. neither of which happened, because there is no god in MCRD. everyone knows that. 

“An *emergency*, huh?” i could almost see the hint of a smile on his impressively smoothly shaven face. i should message one of those guys and ask them what kind of razors they use. i think they shaved multiple times a day. 

“Well. We both know what that means. If it’s an *emergency*, then get two [flashlights]. One with the red lens and one with the blue lens.”

I scrambled over to my duffel bag, half-clenching, half skipping on those overly polished floors. goddamn you, shower shoes. impossible to run in those assholes. after i found them and the appropriate lenses, i *clop clop clop*’d may way back over, to face my “judgement” before “the man.”

“Now hold them over your head.”

“AYE AYE SIRR!!” i snapped those 90 degree [flashlights] above my head like i was trying to break the sound barrier. really, i was trying to break the plumbing on that floor, but here we are playing his little game. 

“Now spin them. And make ambulance noises.”

my mouth repeated the magic words, but my brain needed a second to catch up with exactly what this incredibly muscular, low body fat clown wanted me to do. i think my internal monologue was something along the lines of that one meme with the fallout guy where he goes “excuse me what the fuck”. but my body reacted before i had time to completely process the ridiculousness of the command. i was spinning those motherfuckers over my head like i was a Huey tryna take off from a hot LZ in ‘Nam. my concentration fractured from holding my colon taught and i could feel  Mt. St. Helen ready to blow. 

“weeeewooooo weeWOOooo wEEWOooo” i pitifully gasped. 

“wEeeeewoo WeeEwooOoo”

“Isn’t it an emergency? You gotta let everyone know.” Senior DI stood impassively with his arms crossed. clearly unimpressed with my pathetic “weewoos”. 

i was almost entirely tunnel vision now. what remained of my sight was blurred by tears and embarrassment. i just wanted to take a shit dude, for the love of god

“weEeEE WOOOooo ITS AN EMergENCYYYYYYYYY WEEwooOoo ITS AN EMERRRRRGENCYY—“ then the lump in my throat caught up with me and my speech stuttered. 

at last... my misery was enough.

“Go. Make it quick.”

Relief and adrenaline immediately flooded my entire body, quite honestly almost making me lose what little control i still had left of my sphincter. 

“AYE AYE SIR!!” i bellowed with as much conviction as i could muster, praying this tan and olive green demon wouldn’t prey on me any further. 

with the greatest haste and least grace imaginable, i *clop clop clop*’d my way over to the bathroom, clad in nothing but tiny white briefs and proceeded to immediately birth the antichrist. 

i left that porcelain throne approximately two minutes later, having crowned a morbidly obese intestinal infant, and myself as king— king of shame for that day.

I decided to  go travelling for two years and while I was doing my planning they moved and she changed jobs. I left so many messages for her at her job because I desperately wanted to see her to say goodbye. 

She never got back to me and these were the days before everyone had a cellphone or email.  When I got back I even drove to her parents' house to try and get in touch with her, but they had moved. I thought about her so often - had so many dreams about her, I worried about her. When facebook started to grow I'd look for her there - nothing.

I got married and moved away from the city we lived in. One day on a visit to my in-laws I randomly saw her in a supermarket. I was so excited, but she was totally emotionally closed off to me. It turns out her husband had cheated on her before and during their marriage - in her words ""with anything that sits when they pee."" She straight out asked me if he'd ever come on to me and didn't believe me when I said no. I would have told her if he had!! I don't think she believed me. She gave me her cellphone number and I've tried many times to make plans with her when I go to visit in that area, but she never picks up her phone or replies to text messages. 

I dunno, maybe the perceived betrayal is too much for her to bear. But I seriously hope she's okay. I still think about her often."

3878,"That movie just about ruined me when it first came out. The most terrifying, pants soiling, therapy inducing movie I’ve ever seen. 

My buddy was head projectionist at a local theater back in the days of film. When a new movie came in, by courier, it was his job to piece the reels together and then preview it to make sure the sound lined up and the reels were in the correct order. Usually that meant it was 2am before the multi-plex was clear of patrons and the reels were delivered and assembled.

I LOVE movies and tended bar nearby so it was a symbiotic relationship. I’d close the bar and bring the beer. He’d provide a first run movie or two (or four) a week. The catch was that I had to see everything. He wouldn’t let me pick and choose. Either be his support for ALL movies or he’d find someone else. He was bluffing but I was happy to oblige. Good times with a good friend.

Thing is... I don’t like mind-f**k movies. Scary... no problem. Suspense... cool! Supernatural... fun! Gore... tolerable. But if you put all together... I’m out.

I thought this was going to be a sci-fi thriller like Aliens or Pitch Black. 

👎 Nope

This movie is grade-a horrific. 

Now imagine being in an empty multi-plex at 2am with no one in the theater or building but you and one other person. All lights out. Add to that a, and here’s the kicker, failing sound track that is cutting out and popping at gunshot volume every 10-30 minutes (something was wrong with the sound track) during _this_ movie. 

I HATE this movie!!! Spent the last hour or so in the fetal position. Couldn’t tell you how it ended and never want to find out. "

After about 5 minutes it started panicking, it started moving very fast. And after a few seconds of struggle it died. I felt dirty after watching this. One thing is to kill a small faceless insect that drinks your cat's blood, another is to see it die upclose. I witnessed how it's internal organs stopped moving. Somehow I felt bad after killing a parasitic insect. When you can see it's eyes looking for a way to escape, when you see how it struggles to survive, when you know that it's craving for air, you can't help it - it's sad. it's very very creepy and still haunts me.

The one that most annoys me is Roger &amp; Me- it's such a great premise, it's the movie that made him famous, and almost all of it is fantastic. Factories and other big industries make people dependent on them and then leave, devastating those communities. That is true!

But the central hook is he's barging into buildings trying to ""interview"" the CEO. Like- what is that gonna prove? Nothing.

4015,"My husband cheated on me.  We'd been married nine years at the time.  He had this really weird total emotional breakdown.  Like, he'd be outside just weeping into the wee hours of the morning.  We'd just had our first child.  It was a really strange time.  It's really odd how different our memories of that time are too.  I remember trying desperately to get him to talk to me, he remembers being completely ignored.  It's so strange.  The really odd part though, is that once he started cheating, things started getting better.  He was happier, more engaged, playing with his son, talking to me, being part of our family.  I thought he had gone through whatever emotional turmoil he had and was getting better.  Later I found out that he was with his affair partner when I texted him to let him know I was pregnant with our second child.  Then, of course, I found out about the affair and it all went to shit.  He started spiraling with anxiety and depression and going off on some serious self destructive behavior.  It finally came to a head and I told him he had to go get help, it was more than we could do on our own.  So he's in therapy now.  Doesn't drink anymore.  We're still together.  I don't always know if it's going to be okay, but I have more hope now.  I just hate to give up on a whole person just because they're brain gets fucked.  I dunno.  I don't really have a point.

Well, dickbag boss of mine targets me and puts me on a PIP (process improvement plan). One of the stipulations of my Pip was to come in by 9 and work eight hours until at least five. So I came in and worked from 8:30-5/5:30, depending on my lunch length. Project productivity went down 50% across my three person team. That was my additional hours at home. I was cranking out 55-60 hours a week, and made sure my boss was aware.  
  
So his efforts to get me fired through HR backfired. HR forced him to drop the pip from record directly after my eval and took anything bad said about me afterwords with a huge grain of salt. Dude basically neutered his senior team and left all his promised projects on his own plate. All because he tried to smear me in front of decent people. Seriously, I basically got confirmation in writing that I only need to work 40hrs a week at a salaried position. I watched everything burn around me as I hunted for another job."

I went and bought a large muslin/burlap bag the next day, and carried my books there, and since it wasn't a backpack it was completely OK.

I get inside and the manager tries to use this coupon for half off his order despite the fact that the half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas. The dude is just not getting it and refuses to back down. Some BS about good customer service or whatever. 

Anyway I’m about to bail but they refuse to let me leave. They end up making me sit in their conference room for over an hour while the manager tries to call my boss and demand the discount. I know my boss - he’s a cheap ass - so he won’t back down.

So I’m sitting in the conference room and I call their manager a loser. He is MAD but his assistant or whoever keeps making him repeat it as if I’ll suddenly realize what I said and apologize. What a joke.

They seem to be having some sort of party and there’s a webcam. I get close to it and try and just tell whoever will listen on the other end that I’m being held against my will.

I guess the manager finally realized he was involved in a kidnapping because he had his weird man-baby assistant pay me for the pizzas and they let me leave. They tipped me less than $2.

4167,"My daughter was born with a malignant brain tumor. People always ask how we ""found"" it. She had a bruise on her forehead that didn't go away. We didn't really think much of it, as her skin was so fair you could see all her blood vessels, but brought it up at a well-check visit. The doctor felt the soft spot on the top of her head - it was raised, rounded, swollen. We went from the pediatrician to the ICU in a few hours. The ""bruise"" was the blood vessels of her head being pressed against her skin by her swelling skull. A few more days and she would have likely had major seizures, lost control of her eyes and other functions or worse. She had surgery, chemo, more surgery, more chemo and now she is doing pretty well, despite some long-term impacts on her development.

Lesson: baby heads can tell you a lot. The fontanel (soft spot) should be flat and soft, may raise slightly when baby cries. Can also be a clue for dehydration (if it is sunken).  Bruises on a newborn's head are alarming. She did not cry a lot or seem sick - we had no idea there was anything wrong with her.

4176,"I have a “100% sure I’ve been catfished” story.

Back in 2004 I met a girl on MySpace, she messaged me. We’ve been texting ever since, have never met up, she’s never wanted to video chat, and I did my research and found all the pictures she sends me on the website for a Latino model.  

For years we texted all day every day, sometimes going two nights in a row without sleep because we were texting so much.

It took me watching an episode of catfish to figure out how to find out if she’s really who she says she is. 

I am 100% sure she is not the woman in the pictures and have been since pretty much 2 months after we started texting.

I have no clue how to find out who she really is. At this point I don’t give a fuck what she looks like, she’s a really good friend even though it’s only been through text and a random phone call once in a blue moon. 

I really, really want to know who she really is but it seems impossible to know without her finding out and shutting me out of her life again.

I did some digging once, and questioned her with what I found and she vanished for a year, suddenly reappearing with a new number. I don’t want to lose her as a friend forever but a big part of me wants to know to get some kind of closure so she can finally be 100% real with me for once.

Crazy stuff.

TL:DR: 100% sure I’ve been catfished for 14 years, can’t figure out who she really is, still a good friend though. I used “100%” too much in this story."

It sounds stupid, but I guess I thought we'd end up back together? Though I loved being around this new girl, talking with her, sleeping with her, being with her, afterwards I would feel like I was somehow ruining the future I was 'supposed' to have. It sounds beyond idiotic in retrospect, but it's how I felt at the time.

I didn't begin to realize I loved her until we'd been occasionally seeing each other for a few months, and it would be a flickering feeling late at night when I'd think about her or look at a photo of hers. I'd tell myself I couldn't feel that, because I was supposed to feel it for my ex, who I'd end up with eventually. Only after I'd told this girl that I couldn't see her for the near future because it was unfair to her if I couldn't fully commit, only after I began to feel the reality of never seeing her again, never being with her again, did my true feelings come crashing down.

I've spent most days barely holding onto myself, cried in the bathroom at work, all that shit. It doesn't matter now though. It's true that I don't deserve her, and in her place I would be done with me too. I don't know if any of that makes sense to you? My reasoning at the time doesn't even make sense to me.

I think one of the show's strengths is that it doesn't *have* to be any particular way. It's lasted for 5+ decades because it's less a story than a storytelling engine capable of adapting to any plot. The setting is anywhere in time and space, the genre can be anything from comedy to horror, both the main and side characters change completely every few years, and it's still Doctor Who.

10's death is my least favorite so far in the revived series; I loved 9 [sweetly explaining what was going to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa3NM9Jhkn0) to Rose (and to the audience, many of whom had never seen this before), 11 [removing his bow tie with a smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F84WapAH7M) and saying he will never forget being himself, and 12 [giving an inspirational speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJqsPBWbtjk) to his own future self to make sure ""Let's get it right"". These are very uplifting scenes that convince you that everything's going to be alright.

[10's death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_68Vyc24i1s) on the other hand is played for tragedy. He's mad because he kinda got screwed; all the things he's done to save the universe and the people in it, and in the end he has to die because some sweet old man got stuck in a tube. And if you do the math, he was one of the shortest lived incarnations. It really isn't fair.

But it works because 10's story is Shakespearean tragedy. David Tennant [made a damn good Hamlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYZHb2xo0OI), and they wanted to put some of that into DW. 10 is the classic good man with a flaw that he must die for: Pride. He thought he could reject the rules by becoming the Time Lord Victorious, and got a sharp reminder that the universe will not bow to his will. He burned up a regeneration to keep existing, but it bought him barely any time at all. And he thought he could escape the prophesy of his death, but it caught up to him all the same.

I think there's a wonderful irony that both 10 and his actor's favorite previous incarnation was 5; the 5th Doctor got [the best death in the original series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvAenK95PfQ) when he sacrificed himself without hesitation to save his companion, not even knowing if regeneration would be possible, then died hallucinating his previous companions. 10 also sacrificed himself, and also got to see everyone one last time before he died, but there's a big difference between him and the man he modeled himself after: ego. Between the arrogant 4th and 6th Doctors, 5 was a truly humble person who never really made a fuss about how great he was. His death was the perfect moment of grace to go out on. The 10th Doctor was wonderful, but his ego was too big."

As someone who has worked customer service, it really is only a matter of time before the ""not my problem"" thought process kicks in.

4283,"She was the quintessential politician. Someone connected with all the big names in politics, of both parties. She readily admitted to lying to voters, to having a public position and a private position on issues, meaning she would say one thing that people wanted to hear and then do something very different, something that suited the establishment and all the special interests like the lobbyists, the big corporations, the military-industrial complex (those who profit from war.)

Trump was the antithesis of all that. He wasn't a member of the political establishment. He openly attacked them and called out their corruption, and when he said something he really meant it. It wasn't always polite, but it was honest. All of the pledges he made during his campaign are things he has attempted to follow through on. There is none of the two-facedness you get with a typical politician. That is what endeared him to voters and what sustains his support. 

In 2016, voters were ready for a change. They had been lied to so much in the preceding years, weary from years of pointless wars, and they had been so disappointed that Obama had failed to live up to his rhetoric of hope and change. The voters wanted real change. They wanted candidates from outside of the political mainstream, and they wanted honesty, even if it was blunt."

Also the feeling of Fry's family not knowing what happened to Fry, who suddenly dissapeared one day, and having to live their life without him around, that's a sort of existential dread that just gets to me.

4358,"My dad had an old friend who lived in the country alone. Just him and his two labs. 

It wasn't uncommon to not see Ol' Jim for a week or two at a time. He didn't have a landline and rarely had service on his cell so you either had to wait for him to come back to civilization or go out to him. Well, a week or so rocked on and no one had seen or heard from Ol' Jim so a couple of guys went out to check on him.

They found the house unlocked, which was entirely common since everyone knew Ol' Jim had zero fucks to give and was a slightly crazy old goat and would shoot or stab an intruder without blinking (he'd actually done so years before). When they didn't immediately find him they weren't overly concerned, even with his truck being in the drive. They initially thought maybe he'd gone for a walk with his dogs. 

Here's where it gets strange or odd. One of the guys said he just had a feeling and so he walked to the back of the house to Ol' Jim's bedroom... where he found the door locked. They also heard the dogs on the other side of the door.

They broke the door down and found that Ol' Jim had locked himself, and his dogs, in the bedroom and then proceeded to shoot himself. The coroner said he'd been there for at least a week but it was difficult to really tell as it was in the middle of a Mississippi summer and Ol' Jim didn't have air conditioning. And yes, those poor dogs had been at one of his arms and one of his legs. 

What I find strange about the entire situation is not the manner in which he died as he had made it clear long ago if he ever got sick, he'd just kill himself. What's strange to me is that I know first hand how much that hard, crazy old buzzard loved those dogs (both of which were named Dog and they somehow knew which was which). He would usually venture into town every Saturday, even just for a few minutes, to buy those dogs their weekend treat, which was a huge turkey leg. Those dogs had the run of the house, came and went as they pleased, but were Ol' Jim's faithful companions. 

So knowing he was going to kill himself and knowing the likelihood of being found right away was slim, why would he lock those poor dogs in the room with him? 

After getting a clean bill of health from a vet, the dogs were happily taken in by this young man Ol' Jim looked at like a son and left everything he had to. And Ol' Jim might have appeared like a dirt poor old country dude living in the woods with the bare essentials to get by, but he was apparently loaded from some old family money plus some sales of some commercial property and this and that over the years. He had a few rare, antique guns and a brand new little bright yellow suv. He left every bit of it to this young man he used to work with and came to look at as a son and left in his will that his sister wasn't to get ""jack shit that belonged to me because she's a greedy self absorbed cunt"". Exact words in his will, the young man told me.

Ol' Jim was a one of a kind character. Strange and a little scary sometimes, but one of a kind."

She had been held prisoner for anywhere between a single night up to a week. Bound up with rope, cigarette burns.

She probably died of blood loss from the ""joker style"" facial cuts, they found fecal matter and a ""mystery goo"" in her stomach- so she was forced to eat shit... 

Her violent death aside- the way her mother was treated was just fucking awful.  before police had gotten around to notifying her, a newspaper called her up and said her daughter wona beauty pageant and asked her to give them some background info for publicity shit, and tricked her into dishing any her daughter..  


The killer actually taunted police/reporters for a hot minute afterwards, sending them her personal belongings soaked in  gasoline

4366,"Just spent way too long reading about this. One of the main suspects was a guy called James William Lewis. He wrote a letter to Johnson &amp; Johnson demanding $1 million to stop the poisonings (he asked that the money be sent to an account belonging to a client that bounced a check on him). He lived in the Chicago area where the poisonings took place but moved to NYC 3 weeks before the poisoning occurred in late September 1982. The police couldn't find any direct evidence linking him to the poisonings or to prove he was in the area at the time. He did 13 years for the extortion.

Before this Lewis started a tax preparation business in the 70s. In 78 he was arrested for murder when the dismembered body of one of his clients was found in his attic. The case was dismissed when a judge ruled the search illegal. Then was arrested for filing tax returns for dead people and collecting the refunds. He'd go out on a rural road and put mailboxes in the ground to collect the checks.

After he got out of jail for extortion in 95 he moved to Boston with his wife and started a web design business with a woman who lived on his floor. In 04 he maced that woman, dragged her into his apartment, and then drugged and raped her. He spent 3 years awaiting trial before the case was dropped when she refused to testify. In 09 his house was searched and he and his wife gave DNA and fingerprints to the FBI for the poisoning case. Then in 2010 he wrote a book called ""Poison!: The Doctor's Dilemma""... not about the tylenol poisoning but apparently about how the town he grew up in had lead in the water and this caused deaths and mental problems in kids in the town. He even promoted the book on a Boston cable access show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISdDdR9NqoY

http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-02-08/news/0902070169_1_tylenol-killings-tylenol-murders-investigators/2

Another suspect in the poisoning case is none other than Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber. He grew up in Chicago, commited his first 4 bombings there, and his parents had a home just 20 minutes from the stores the poisoned tylenol were found at. He also had a thing for ""wood"" themes. His bombs were often made of wood, and sometimes included twigs or leaves. One of his mail bomb victims around the same time was Percy Wood from Lake Forest. His fake return address was Frederick Benjamin Isaac Wood, 549 Wood Street, Woodlake California. The founders of the company that made the tylenol were Robert Wood Johnson and James Wood Johnson. Poisoned tylenol was left at Woodfield Shopping Center, Elk Grove Village."
4367,"&gt;There are many different ways to handle an unscripted scene. One was in Pirates of The Caribbean they told everyone Captain Jack was gonna walk down the stairs, and it ended up being the actor everyone thought wasn't coming back. The look on everyones faces are genuine surprise. 

This is untrue, since they had to reshoot that scene a couple of times and didn't use the original take. By then they were already deep into making part 3 (being that they shot the films back to back), and Rush had been around set for days at that point. They tried to keep the ruse going on the DVD commentary, but other actors and Rush himself have confirmed that it's not the case.

&gt;In Jurassic Park the kids in the jeep are actually scared for their lives. The scene where the T-rex pushed the glass down on them wasn't supposed to happen, a series of unfortunate events led to a horrific scene for the movie, and the crew.

Also untrue, as you can tell by the way the camera is placed and how the kids react perfectly in time with the glass to it moving. Also later confirmed by the set guys and director that it was always intended, plus it's in the script."

That said, it’s kinda stupid just because it’s such a cliche tattoo and I feel like everyone has it. People should come up with a different variety of it and be creative rather than just having a banner through a heart. "

Like a friend of mine were chilling in another friends house and they have a puppy. One of the roommates was showing us his novelty katana his sister got from Japan. While my friend was holding it I just looked her in the eyes and said, expressionless, ""You must now behead the puppy"".

4394,"My family had some family friends when I was growing up. We spent holidays with them, went out with them, I grew up with their kids. The mom always seemed a bit eccentric but we all kind of shrugged it off as she'd had a rough childhood and we figured she just came out of it with some quirks. However, when she got into her early 30's she went totally off the rails, started sending letters (not emails, actual letters typed out on a computer) to friends and family about these absolutely delusional situations that definitely didn't happen (I know because her husband, who is by all accounts a very kind and sane man, would later call and tell us that she's having mental health issues and to please disregard the letters). She couldn't be left alone with the kids anymore, so her husband just disappeared for a long time as he had to oversee her and the kids at all times. 

A few years later he called us up and told us that she had committed suicide and his son had been the one who found her. I went to her funeral and it was so sad because she'd put her kids through so much (not necessarily by her own fault, but still) that they were not even sad. They were relieved. One of them (who is on the spectrum and doesn't understand social rules too well) actually said that he was glad she was gone. Sad situation all around. 

Basically, mental illness can just manifest unexpectedly and destroy people's lives. My family friend certainly had no idea this was going to happen until after his kids had started school and his wife just snapped. Luckily, he's with a very nice woman now and his kids seem to be as well-adjusted as one could expect under such circumstances. Mental illness really is a bitch."

Every other day we had an adventure and on the off days we relaxed at our resort enjoying free food, free booze, and our feet in the sand at the beach. The thing she loved most was the snorkeling at the beach in Akumal. It was there where she swam with the sea turtles and the beautiful fishes. She spent a total of 3 hours out in the water swimming with the turtles and taking pictures.

4411,"In middle school, I transferred from a private school to public. I was an awkward, pre-pubescent mess of silence and confusion. One kid made me his personal punching bag all year. I talked with teachers, but since none of them ever saw anything they said they can’t do but so much. One day, he ran behind me and smacked my glasses off my face, scratching them. I didn’t think. I just reacted. I turned around, three the hardest punch I was able to muster, and busted his nose. My parents had just gotten me glasses, after needing them for years, and now they were scratched. 

The kid started blubbering, and ran to find a teacher. About two minutes later, my adrenaline died and I was sick to my stomach with guilt. The shit and my favorite teacher, Mr. Bank walked towards me. He sent the kid away to our next class, but asked me to talk with him. He asked how my hand was, why I hit him, etc. He knew the kid was a jerk, and was mad that school policy wouldn’t let him help me without being a direct witness. I confessed, expecting to be suspended for fighting. Instead, he taught me to make a solid fist (apparently the way I did it could screw up my hand), and said that he was very sorry but since he wasn’t a direct witness, he couldn’t do anything with a wink. 

That kid never messed with me again, and I see Mr. Bank around town every so often. He’s one of the only teachers I keep in touch with since graduating. "

4432,"I knew a dog while I was in high school, a giant Rottweiler. He was a real sweety, scared of just about everything, but he would not tolerate roughhousing of any sort, he would just plant himself between anybody being to physical.

Anyway, this enormous dog thought he was a cat (raised with three older cats) and he would *purr* when he was happy. If you didn't know the dog it would be terrifying because this dog is growling deep in his throat. I don't remember how I figured it out but this dog liked to be moo'd at. I would sit down in front of him and moo like a cow and he would sit there and purr back at me. Back and forth moo,purr,moo,purr.... I miss that dog."

And for patients, heed the advice about making a list of what you need and asking for it all at once. Don't call for an extra blanket and, when I come back to deliver it, ask for a box of tissues, and then when I return to deliver that, ask for a glass of water, etc. It's much more efficient for me to grab everything at once and make it one big trip, than running back and forth forever.

Also, for family and friends of a patient, designate one spokesperson who will communicate with the hospital and everyone else. It takes time away from patient care if I'm giving the exact same updates to my patient's spouse, brothers, sisters, children, etc. Keep it to one person who can pass on the updates to the entire family.

Lastly, it's not a big deal but we do find it kind of funny...but don't walk in and say, ""I'm looking for my dad"" or ""Who is my mom's nurse?"" I don't know who you are and I don't know who your mom/dad/whoever is. It's just better to refer to the patient by their name."

4476,"This was 20 years ago.  I used to share a computer with a coworker, and it was her first week on the job.

​

I had lost a file and tried to recover it with scandisk.exe.  Along that file I also recovered a file containing hundreds of emails dating back over a couple of years.  It consisted of blocks of text followed by many lines of meta data in repeating sequences, and would have probably been 100 pages long to print out.

​

Having no idea what I was looking at initially I read on.  Certain words in teh text popped out.  Words like clitoris, orgasm, you get the idea.  I still had not idea WTF this was.

​

As I read on it slowly dawned on me.  My new coworker had transferred her old emails to this computer and somehow they got lost the day before.  By coincidence I had lost my file the same day and recovered both.

​

She was going through a divorce and her (work) emails to some friend described how she was prepetually horny.  Accordingly, she would go to the bathroom 4 or 5 times a day (at work) to masturbate.  The descriptions wee grahic and long winded.  She talked about a porno she loved, and how she fancied women more than men.  She described having lots of casual sex with guys she met in bars.

​

I learned way too much about this overweight, middle aged mother of two whith whome I had worked for 3 days.  Way too much.

​

For several months afterwards any time whe went to the bathroom I had a chuckle.

The whole “overprotective” dad stereotype is ridiculous. Your kids are going to have sex; there is no stopping it. I’m totally fine with ensuring they are not too young, and I’m not saying give them full-on opportunities to do it. Just teach them common sense and how to be safe. They’ll appreciate that much more, and NEVER judge them if you do find out they did it. Be the person they can come to for comfort and advice; especially if they didn’t have the best experience with it. My parents thankfully taught me well in that regard and I wish all parents did that.

I burst in the room and he immediately stopped and tried to run through me but I had about 30 pounds and six inches on him. I was blinded by rage in a way I had never known before or since. I started punching, pounding, grabbing and slamming him into the walls, a dresser, everything. I felt his resistance begin to fade but I didn't stop. It ended up that I caved his skull in on the dresser and he died after a 2 day coma.

I don't lose sleep over it but I do feel bad. He was a piece of shit but I never wanted blood on my hands. This was in college about 8 years ago and I still wonder if he'd have turned his life around one day. But I also realize he was in his 20's, not a dumb teenager who made a horrible drunk mistake.

My ex and I don't talk anymore and I knew she was grateful but she also never saw me the same way after that. "

He showed me all of his property, his favourite scenery and a couple of the neighbour's property (someone's bull had broken into another field, so he said he'd have to let that neighbour know where to find his livestock - it was such a mundane but fun event). 



We go in to land and a few feet from the ground, we lurch sideways and sirens start to blare and I'm just sitting there like, oh maybe this is normal when you land (I have never been in a 2 seater before). He quickly corrects and lands the plane pretty rough and we slowly roll to a stop. He starts to apologize profusely and says that some wind caught the wing. He's jabbering and apologizing and talking over what went wrong. Then I start to realize that we were very close to crashing and I was just sitting there completely oblivious. "

4629,"She went to college with me and was in ROTC with me. She wasn't the BEST looking but neither am I. She was a bit quiet and I chalked that up to being shy (in reality it was because she had a learning disability). I invited over to my barracks room while my room mate went to an anime/tabletop/don'tknow meeting. I was day drinking and asked her if she wanted to lay in bed with me and watch Spartacus. She said that she had never saw it before and wondered if that was okay and I said ""I don't think thats relevant"", so the point went across. She came over, laid in bed, and I start feeling her up. I pull her panties down and I want to have sex, but damn, I want to watch Spartacus too! So I just had her lay on her stomach so that we could both have sex and watch Spartacus. I'm going at it when I hear a nasty sound that sounded like maybe a queef. I look down at her and don't notice anything unusual so I keep going to town. I start to smell a little something, maybe she had farted? Whatever, I'm drunk, I'm going to continue my mission.

It was at that point that the smell was so overwhelming that I glanced down at my dick and realized what happened. She shat. She shat herself. While I was fucking her. I had shit on my dick and on my belly. I pumped down off the bed and start getting mad. I'm about to turn around and cuss her out when I see her pulling her panties up. I stop her, feel a bit of compassion, and say ""Stop...don't pull up your panties...you've....had ....an accident"". She glances down, gasps in horror and apologized. I told her NOT TO MOVE and that I'd go wipe off....then she could wipe off...then she needed to leave the room. Girls were not allowed in boys room and vice versa. I try to wipe off but jesus christ it was nasty and running and I almost puked. I wiped off a good bit and went to tell her that she just needed to leave, because I needed to shower (and cry). She just pulled up her panties and left.

What makes this situation worst is what happened next. I told her to tell no one about us hooking up and I promise not to tell anyone that she pooped herself during sex. She obviously started telling people that we were a couple and that I was just being low-key about it. I had to text her a few times to remind her...we had sex once (kinda?) and never again. I don't want anything to do with her but I'll be a gentleman and not ruin her reputation. She kept telling people (including girls that I liked) that I was taken etc while lying about it to me. People would literally show me their facebook messages where she claimed to have met my mother (mother has been dead for 20+ years at this point in time). Gave another warning, she didn't listen, so I told people about it. She actually stopped contact for a year. I met a girl, we got serious. We move in together. Things are well. The entire time, she is texting me from google numbers, emailing me from new emails (because I'm blocking her alot) and she even went as far as to contact my girlfriend to say that I was knocking on her door looking for a hookup when I was out of the country! Towards the end of college, I had proposed and things were going good and she started texting and calling again. She had failed out of college at this point. She was calling 10+ a day. I decided enough was enough, and found out her mothers phone number. I called her mother and told her everything (Yes. Everything.) and she assured me that I'd never be contacted again. While I'm on the phone with her mother, she is texting me! I immediately texted her and said ""Mommy wants to talk"" and never heard from her again.

TLDR: Girl pooped on me.

4637,"Came here looking for ""First Person Shooter"" to be mentioned. They all looked so pained filming that episode. 

And it's unpopular but I think ""The Field Where I Died"" is one of the strongest written episodes. People (shippers) hate it because it proposes Mulder and Scully aren't soulmates. It starts as a standard FBI vs Jonestown cult scenario and then veers into some deep philosophical territory. It's strong performances directed by Rob Bowman, whom arguably directed some of the best episodes alongside Vince Gilligan. X-Files sure was hit and miss at times but I'll always commend them for going off the beaten path and challenge the viewer. "

Oxford University, meanwhile, is older than the Aztec Empire (this is reposted to /r/TIL just as often as someone from Oxford mistakenly claims their university is better than Cambridge’s).

Consider warlords in Africa, ISIS in the middle east, etc. They have certain ideals, and will kill anyone and everyone who doesn't follow them.

Even if we wiped those people out, unless we had constant military roaming the streets, which in itself could result in some rebellion by the people or corruption among the soldiers (not saying all soldiers are bad, large majority are good), it could end up make things worse.

Then the UN would also have to approve and support all of this, or another country could be at war with us for trying to do what we're attempting, and that's if it works.

This was in 2010 though so I'm sure SF has eclipsed Marin in rental pricing by now. I've stayed in SF ever since with ranging pay from $30k/yr to $100k/yr and I must have been lucky to find deals on places to rent. Most of them have been with a room mate or two, but now I have a 1br with a yard at $1500/mth utilities included. It has been a bummer not being able to make much ground on eventually trying to own a house in the bay area when I could easily buy in many other places. Also, when I was making a $30k/yr salary I had to buy food on a credit card and had really cheap rent for the place I was in (rent controlled 3br in North Beach at $1900/mth total). "

4786,"When I had to put my dog Max down, I knew a week in advance. I tried to do everything I could to make his last days with me as happy and as comfortable as I could. He slept in the bed regardless of what husband said. I would drop everything to pet him if I caught him even just looking towards me (he was blind by that time). But the thing I did that I am the most happy for because it clearly brought him more joy than I could have hoped for was cook him a ""last supper"". He got a loaded baked potato, grilled shrimp and a t-bone steak (don't even buy those for myself). Now before people freak out - this was a 17 year old dog that had lived off of scraps and human food his entire life through circumstances out of my control and I was gonna be damned if he wasn't spoiled as much as possible. After all, it was his last night with us. And it was the best decision I have ever made. It had been months since I had seen him wag his tail and that night I got to watch him gleefully toss a steak over his head just to catch it and continue ripping it apart in enjoyment. The next morning before we brought him in I made pancakes. He was always my tester (I give him the first few pancakes out of the pan) and that was his favorite Saturday routine. He got a plate of pancakes and syrup and sausage later and made a sticky mess of himself. We brought him in, he gave me an accepting look through his cataracts riddled eyes, and I knew I did what I could to tell him how much I loved him and cherished him. 

The moral of the story is do everything you can now to spoil the shit out of your fur baby. You will never regret it. "

On reaching the path I glanced back and saw a group of bully-type kids about a hundred yards behind me and still at the top of the hill. Just then I went around a bend in the path, and I took off running, then cut into the scrub forest on the hill and hid in the underbrush. I was just about to start feeling foolish because those kids had never bothered me, but then the the gang of boys came pelting down the path, saying things like ""Come on! We can still catch him!"" They were NOT trying to catch me to trade bubble gum cards, I assure you. I stayed put for half an hour before continuing home.  I never took that shortcut again."

Went on a date. Dude is a programing nerd, timid, nervous and very jittery. The first time I saw him, my mind immediately went straight to “oh poor thing, he must be so shy and a kind person.” He was not my type, but did make me go “aww” and we hit it off from there. 

The moment he opened up tho, holly shit, his mouth spew hateful things. He legitly hates fat people, thinks the world owes him something. I came over to his house and he yelled at his parents names because they did something he didn’t like. After telling him things won’t work out between us he immediately tried to coax his ex (who is not into sex before marriage) into having sex with him.

Moral of the story: just because someone is shy and nerdy doesn’t mean they are good people. Sometimes they are just too shy to be an apparent asshole.

When he did finally maybe a year later there was another girl he super liked but she didn't have feelings back so back to depression. This repeats again and now he's constantly pissed off at everything. He misplaces car keys, straight to pissed off/screaming about it.  Like seconds after looking and not finding. Its like that with everything and I don't know how to help him and it's affecting my own moods.  He sees a psych and takes meds now for the past two years, dunno how much they help, he says not at all. I wish good stuff for the guy, but he believes whole world is against him.

While confrontation is the right move, it's hard.

Here's an idea for you. Start making plans to hang out when he's busy.

He's got work? Go to dinner that night. At dinner make plans to go do something else and 'forget' to invite him. 

This will either lead to the confrontation you need to have, or it will lead to him slowly being edged out of the group. 

----

If/when you're ready, someone should confront him, alone, spare him the embarrassment and share your constructive criticism.

Not proud of my actions here. And then I'd frequently spend an hour afterwards pacing the parking lot and out back behind the building, doing one of three things; singing to myself, quietly sobbing, or muttering under my breath. At all hours. I try to compensate for this by being more friendly to my neighbours now but during that period I met most kinds of human contact with a look of panic and silence before making the quickest possible exit without looking like I was trying to run away.

5000,"I go to Western University, which is often considered one of the top party schools in at least the province, if not the country. 

Well, a few years back, the school decided that students were partying too hard during homecoming, and in an effort to deter the party scene, the school moved homecoming to the same time as midterms so everyone will be studying instead. Good idea, right? 

Nope. In revolt, students started a new tradition called “fake homecoming”, set a few weeks earlier than real homecoming. Fake homecoming, or “foco” is basically the biggest street party of the year, where people start drinking at like 10am, littering the entire street and students from other universities come for the weekend to join the party. 

tl;dr school moves homecoming to midterms to stop partying and students create a new tradition in its place that involves even more partying than before. "

But, each time you fight back and remind yourself of who's boss, you'll be closer to not letting it control you. You're gonna have to beat it back one victory at a time.

5209,"Similar story but I’m the patient. Had mild headaches. Didn’t go to the doctors as had migraines as a kid but I still felt like something was really wrong. Woke up one morning and couldn’t remember the word ‘and’. All my sentences came out without any conjunctives and I couldn’t form any sentences. So instead of saying something like ‘I’m thirsty can I get some water please?’ It just came out as ‘water mouth now’. I just couldn’t remember the words. Said to my housemate ‘brain tumour’ and pointed to my head. May I also add that I know absolutely nothing at all about health issues/tumours/medicine/etc. so god knows why I came to this conclusion. She thought I was mad but took me to the doctor anyway. He concurred nothing was wrong and was just a bad headache with aura. Next day speech is back but still convinced I had a brain tumour. Kept going to the doctors, they kept refusing to do any tests, I was still convinced I had a tumour. Not sure why, it was just stuck in my head (pun intended). About 6 months later I  was out drinking one night and lost all my vision in my left eye and some in my right so my housemate rang an ambulance. Scans were finally done and shocker, I had a really small brain tumour. Nothing cancerous or that bad, it was just causing a build up of cerebral fluid which was putting pressure on my optic nerve. Neurologist said I was close to going blind at the age of 20. Medications shrunk it down enough that I’m back to perfect health without the need for surgery. It’s being monitored but no growth so doc thinks it’s ok to stay in my head (fluid also back to a normal level)

5215,"(Copied from UrbanDictionary)
&gt;A fascinating beast. The majority of the species are hideously repugnant and unintelligent, and yet they manage to breed in ever-increasing numbers and populate an area known as the outer west. It is quite common to find five or six offspring in each family group, often with a different father for each new baby.

&gt;Their habitat consists of a weatherboard or brick-veneer dwelling and is characterised by an early-model Holden or Ford in the driveway surrounded by a group of males discussing why the carby is stuffed and the results of last night's footy (a primitive gladiator-like spectator sport enjoyed by most bogans).

&gt;The female of the species, while smaller in stature, is far more loud and aggressive than the male. While the males tend to be very friendly and congregate with other males, the females spend most of their time in supermarkets and shopping malls, using a shrill high-pitched call to discipline their children and contact other females.

&gt;Males and females rarely interact socially except during breeding season, which is otherwise known as Friday night. During this time, females are allowed to enter the male-dominated area known as ""the pub"" and display their impressive coloured plumageto a prospective mate. 
Herein lies an intersting phenomenon. Males will often fight over a particularly attractive female and she will mate with only one male, while some less attractive females have been known to have several partners simultaneously. 

&gt;Ahhhh. The wonders of nature.

5239,"We'd always had a ""weird,"" platonic friendship. We used to send each other nudes all the time. I'm not exactly sure how it began, but it wasn't sexual. 

We liked to think of them as artsy fartsy. About the position, the lighting, etc. Like damn renaissance paintings. We were completely open about everything we thought, what we were into, what we wanted to try, things like that. 

I mean, our friendship wasn't solely  relied on things deemed sexual. We were really close, like normal best friends. 

So when we talked about it, and knowing we were so close, it was a pretty casual conversation, yet something he did take seriously. He understood what I wanted, and he wanted to be the one to take care of me. The whole, it's from someone that loves you, considers you, knows you as a whole and not just this one part of you thing. He didn't insist at all. It was my idea, and he agreed that it should be him.

It wasn't really awkward afterwards. There was a little phase of ""So.. are we going to continue to do this?"" 

I do think we could be in a relationship if we wanted to be. There's absolutely nothing wrong with him. He's a total sugarplum, I just don't want one, and as far as I know he doesn't either. 

Not just with each other, but at all. It was very loving, intimate, and special in a way I didn't think it could be - but still managed to be platonic on both sides. 

There's definitely a little ""more love,"" there, but we aren't friends with benefits or anything. It's not something we brag about, but if someone asks I'd be willing to say it was him and not feel weird about it.

The funny thing about Scientology is that their PR often centers around equality, even if it is completely for show and disingenuous. That's how you know they prey on people. They create a narrative to suck people in until they are roped in too far where if they left, they would basically lose everyone they associate with.

It's kind of ghetto and not a versastile as a snake but if you play with it, it'll totally work.

As for the kids, set consequences - spanking, taking away toys, grounding, no TV, whatever.  Tell them once.  If they don't listen, then the consequences are immediate.  No more yelling.  No more screaming.  You told them.  They heard you.  They didn't listen.  Now the wrath of god falls on their heads.  They'll learn after a few times. "

5326,"People are too optimistic to say, ""find something you love and you'll never work a day in your life.""

I'd rather remain a realist and say, ""find something that you can tolerate for 9 hours in the day so that you can go home and enjoy a decent home, good food, and good company.""

The first one is a lie, sensationalized  by a sense of good Ole fashioned American individualism. Nope. 1950s America is over. We can't support a household by the dad only having a factory job. Both parents need to work and at least one of them should have a master's or higher degree to retain that lifestyle. Life is undoubtedly more comfortable now, but it isn't ""easier"" in the slightest. Expectations have shot through the roof. You want to succeed now? Stay at University for 6+ years, accruing decades worth of debt, and you just might be lucky enough to find a job that grinds you into a pulp by year 3. Oh and you still have 3/4 of that debt still to pay. Want to go on vacation? Hell no, you're in debt. Want to start a family? Hopefully your spouse is loaded or is comfortable taking on your debt to (assuming they aren't in debt either). The pressure and the expectation to succeed is just so much higher than it used to be. The road is longer and there are more hurdles now, not to mention the competition is just unreal now (hence why the need to distinguish yourself with graduate degrees). 

So screw people that say, ""do what you like and it will all work out."" That's BS. That's like a lottery winner telling you to buy a lottery ticket because ""someone will win it.""

Nope. Find a job that isn't terrible. Find a job that has fun coworkers. If you have to decrease your means of living then do so. But know the only thing that matters in this world is good food, good drink, and good company. Do whatever you have to do to meet those three and you'll live without regrets.

This is coming from someone who had scholarships in college, has a masters degree, is in zero debt, has a wife and kid and is about to hit 30. My road has been easy, but I know the landscape out there. It's cutthroat like a mother fucker. Baby boomers have no idea what it takes a 20-30 year old to succeed in today's world. They think a simple bachelor's degree will set you up for success. Lol.

I.e. My mom is a senior director where she works. That job is now only open to PhD's with 20 years of experience in the field. And she only has a bachelor's degree in a non-relevant field. People want to call us entitled or priviledged; I call having a 60 year old political science major making a $100k+/year to send emails as being about as priviledged as you can get. If I wanted her job, I'd have to take on about $100k of debt just for the system to not kick my resume out of the system. "

Traditional tattoos have a nautical theme because tattooing in the west became big amongst sailors in the navy in the 1700's. These sailors would visit east Asia and pick up tattoos from places like japan and the Pacific island's.

Guess what sailors like. Sailor type stuff. This looks stuck and has become tradition over several hundred years. "

I remember talking to a friend about Breaking Bad and why I loved the show and its characters. It has you rooting for questionable people, at questionable times. There is so much nuance to even the worst of villains and that is a very odd but incredible feeling.

My friend however, said ""I can't do it, man. I can't get into it. I like my heros black and white..."", meaning he wasn't into the whole anti-hero thing (fitting, as he is a pretty well known illustrator for Topps/Lucas Arts).

And, sadly enough, poor kids would also have the same uniforms, but they'd be very dirty and poorly taken care of. The parents were often too busy working multiple jobs to consistently wash the uniforms.

As a teacher, I have to admit that uniforms were nice because it simply made it easy to recognize dress code violations. In schools where there weren't uniforms, what one teacher would view as a violation (skirt too short, shirt too low cut, obscene logos or ""gang"" association) would be totally fine for another teacher.

Yes they can figure out quite a bit and try to piece together events fairly accurately most of the time.

The truth is, we have zero idea what is happening in her head and she may have zero thoughts about the entire situation. She may never return to a body, may never talk about it, may never try to help the case in any way.

Those who are depressed often find empowerment in realizing when it is okay to be sad and when it isn't. Most people these days joke about being depressed when really they're just sad,  and sad for healthy reasons. 

Depression is far worse. "

5467,"I agree. Most people will say that they feel sorry for abused kids and think abuse is horrible, but more often than not, people who were abused by their family are just straight up not believed, dismissed outright, or told they're being dramatic. Reddit's own community for these kids, /r/raisedbynarcissists, has trolling problems too. Mods there are on point, though.

A child that's been abused by parents is often told ""Your mom did her best, she loves you."" or ""Your dad is family, you have to forgive him."" or ""you only have ONE aunt/uncle. They're your biggest fan"".

Or ""All kids hate their parents at some point..come on."" Or they shuffle like a dancing little bitch and try to change the subject. Or go ""It couldn't have been THAT bad."" Kids that go to adults about abuse are simply not believed, and adult children get responses like the ones you receive. Virtue signaling is big, very few people actually give a shit about abused kids. This is confirmed by that fact that society, and a large chunk of reddit, *genuinely believe* that it's alright to beat children and strap them down and remove parts of their body for literally no medical reason whatsoever. That children have not grown old enough for their first set of human rights yet, or that they are just kids and don't deserve bodily autonomy. Absolutely blows my mind.

People love to hem and haw about how terrible abuse is and how greatly those poor children must have suffered, but when someone in their own family comes to them, ""Your father wouldn't look at you in that way. You're being dramatic."" or ""Your uncle is a good, god-fearing man, and he would NEVER do that to you. Now run along."" is a theme that happens too much.

The victim blaming ""family is everything"" and ""rugsweep, forgive and forget"" culture in churches and houses all across America is repulsive.

On youtube there is an audio recording of an adult woman's obsessive, narcissistic mother and father telling her they are stalking her and are going to get her under control, telling her no one cares for her. Very, very typical narc rambles to anyone who is familiar with narcissists and their behavior. Essentially completely textbook, would actually be a great study case. There are a lot of people who get it in the comments and sympathize. There are also a lot telling the girl to respect her parents and stop being a whore/brat/cunt. I believe even having one person on this Earth who does not truly care about abused children is one worthless person way too many.

These huges swathes of kids raped, mutilated, neglected, denied medical care, brainwashed, tortured, burned, or psychologically destroyed for life are like America's filthy little secret no one wants to talk about, because we don't want to admit letting literally anybody have another human being at their complete mercy without any sort of vetting or educational process might have been a shitty idea, and allowing a culture of victim blaming to fester was unacceptable. God forbid we treat kids like human beings, or enact legislation to protect them. Don't want to control anyone, don't want to make the people with normal parents uncomfortable.

I told my parents and they were shocked, a couple hours after, my mom calls me back and tells me to go to one expensive hospital and she'll meet me there (strange because I knew we didn't have the resources to pay for that), that she had an insurance that will cover the hospital expenses and they were bringing the treatment from the US.

A couple of weeks after that, when I was out of the hospital and completely recovered she told me the insurance was really my biological father whom I never met before, and had no clue he existed at that moment, but he was a somehow successful architect, and who I thought was my father was not my biological father, my whole family knew about that for 23 years and no one ever said anything.

They drove slow, with the lights off, and although I was taken to a bed right away, the first hour or so in the Emergency room was very calm... until the doctor got my CT results back and saw that I had developed multiple massive Pulmonary Embolisms (blood clots in your lungs) that had broken off from a massive DVT (blood clots but in your leg) from when I had sat down earlier.

5533,"I am not a horticulturalist, but this is my understanding: In order to produce fruit, the Haas tree has to be pollinated. The characteristics of the fruit are determined by the DNA of the tree that produces it, but the seed contained within has DNA from the Haas tree and whatever pollinated it, so the tree that grows from that seed will end up producing a cultivar that is different to some degree from either of the parents.

Edit: Out of curiosity I'm now looking into this further. The Haas tree is self pollinating, so in theory you could self-pollinate the tree, and the seeds should produce trees that have the same cultivar. Therefore it may not be entirely true when I wrote that nobody can produce them from seeds. It is likely that the trees are only grown via grafting for a few other reasons:

1. Cross-pollination results in larger crops, so producing a crop from self-pollination just to be able to plant the seeds to grow more trees means giving up a very profitable growing season, and the Hass tree already only produces a good yield every other year.

2. Unless the self pollination is strictly controlled, a tree could unintentionally still be cross pollinated by natural factors (bees, wind, etc.) You could end up with seeds that do not produce Haas avocados without realizing it.

3. It will take over five years from the time a tree is planted until it bears fruit, and only then could you verify if the tree produces the correct fruit.

Taken together, all these factors mean taking a huge risk when attempting to grow a new Haas tree from a seed, whereas grafting the tree gives 100% predictable results."

They know exactly what chemicals are in them and the amount of those chemicals that are safe for the human body. Once they know this information, they go above and beyond to make sure the levels of whatever chemicals are far lower than these safe amounts. The people who study vaccines want nothing more than to eradicate disease and help others and none of them would dream of passing on anything that was barely studied. They also would not be allowed by their colleagues, employers, or the government to pass along barely studied vaccines.

5664,"Actually... It's not that simple.

The hours are not hard, I admit. However, minutes are a little tricky to read in an analog watch.

We learn how to think of time with sexagesimal system, but we never actually get to divide 60 by 12 in real life except for school maybe, unless you're trying to read the clock.

For a person who's never read it before, the ticks mean 1 to 12, easy for the hours, but not for the minutes. They don't instantly realize you're supposed to treat 12 as 60 minutes, and each tick would represent 5 minutes. They would have to take some time to get to that conclusion, and even if they did, there's also getting used to which tick represents which minute (for some is not that easy to multiply, believe me), so they just let it go and don't take the time to learn.

Side note: the hands also could mean either hours or minutes or anything if the person hasn't learnt it too."

5674,"&gt; The biggest sluts have the weakest father. The father sets the threshold for manliness and value of a man that her future partners will be, thus the more masculine a father without being controlling, the less slutty the daughter. Girls before puberty will undergo a phasee or phases were they crush on their father, every girls first crush is their own father (if present) I believe this is an evolutionary mechanism that sets the bar of minmum required masculinity for the girl in later life

&gt;Just a theory of mine, anecdotal evidence is overwhelming though

&gt; Violence till death is certainly a feminine trait. Men fighting each other (bar fight, etc) rarely kipp each other and even if, rather by accident. The emotions present in real killers (isolation, rightousness, anxiety, arrogance, jealousy) are distinctly feminine.

5692,"It's also worth noting that a 'housewife' back in the day had a shitload of work to do (especially on a farm, which is a whole other thing and still involves a shitload of work today). Each family meal had to be made from scratch. Enough food had to be stored for the winter, so you had to have a big enough garden to get your whole family from summer to winter. And clothing-- imagine having to stitch every item your family would ever wear, as well as all the sheets/quilts/curtains/etc in your home. Laundry was done manually as well, and every item needed ironing. All this while caring for X children full-time.

It wasn't until the 50s that a housewife's job became something one could actually get bored doing. The stereotype of a housewife's job being just sitting around looking pretty and getting supper on the table didn't exist until mid century-- before that, if you just sat around, your family went unfed and unclothed. And fuck, I didn't even get into the effort it took to actually clean the house, just the survival basics. 

Just to clarify, a stay-at-home parent today still has a lot of work raising children, and our standard for child-care are a hell of a lot higher than they've ever been before. I don't mean to say that they're lazy or anything, just to point out that 100+ yrs ago your average housewife had a lot more hard labor to do that we might not even think about today, just between grocery stores &amp; washing machines."

5705,"that just reminded me of a story from my first couple days of boot camp. for the record, marine corps boot camp is *very* strict with verbiage. you need to scream at the top of your lungs the exact right phrases in the exact correct order or you’ll be 1) ignored 2) made to repeat yourself until you get it right (which they like to do ad nauseum) or 3) sent to the front of the squad bay to be Pt’d until you forget whatever it was that you wanted to say. 

now, i’m sure this is true for almost any basic training recruit at any given depot, but the first week or so i was so nervous or tired or unsure of the rules that i could NOT take a shit. keep in mind, all of our bathroom “privileges” are timed throughout the day, to the literal second. they keep a very tight schedule. 

so, enter “Black Friday”, the infamous day you meet your drill instructors. they really play up the theatrics on that day specifically, performing even more over-the-top caricatures than the drill instructor facade they normally put  on. sprinting around the squad bay, throwing shit everywhere, dumping foot lockers, tossing mattresses and toppling bunk racks like dominoes, screaming at the literal top of their lungs (and in some cases, their 2” lifted dress shoes because these guys notoriously have some kind of napoleon complex). they even like to bring in *even more* drill instructors from other training companies or the newly minted drill instructors to give them some practice just blasting people and general fuckery. it was like a swarm of very angry, very sweaty yellow jackets, causing this indescribable din in a suddenly dusty room. unreal. i’ll never forget it. 

so, by this point, i had been sent to the front of the squad bay to be “slayed” about 4 or 5 times over the course of an hour. i was very sweaty and praying i had “done my time” so to speak and they would move on to fuck with some other unfortunate soul. this was day 6 or 7 i’d been at the depot and my bowels had been too caught up with my testicles, being retracted as far as they’d go out of complete fear and the inhuman amount of cortisol i’m sure my brain was dumping into my system. that, combined with the “sack lunches” they’d been giving us (before we got to go to the “real recruit” chow hall”) made for a pretty interesting blockage in my intestinal tract. but that had come to an end in the last few hours. 

i think at some point my brain decided enough sweat had left my body and the better route for said sweat was to go directly into my GI tract, because after 7 days of stale animal crackers and hard boiled eggs half-poached by the mid day sun, i finally felt the dam start to break. and oh boy, it was really the worst timing for it. 

the rumbling in my stomach was so loud, it could be heard several racks away and my neighbors kept glancing at me with pleading eyes to make it stop, because as any service member will tell you, misery loves company, and a drill instructor’s favorite game is “you and five of your closest friends, hold your foot lockers over your heads for the next fifteen minutes.” but this was a force to be reckoned with. my body was telling— no, demanding of me— it was time to go. 

after a time, and multiple episodes of cold sweats one can only attribute to an ever-increasing need to release their bowels, my body apparently got the hint that it would not receive the relief it so craved. things got quiet. 

at this point, the squad bay had been, very thoroughly, what we very affectionately refer to as “tornado’d”. it’s exactly what it sounds like— as if a T5 tornado had passed through. shoes, blouses, mattresses, linens, all piled in the middle of the room, and a chaos of “personal” belongings scattered everywhere else. the bunks looked like someone had set up a very cruel Rube Goldberg machine that we’d inevitably have to pick up (and place from the wall, to the literal inch, making sure each was exactly parallel with all 30 others on both sides of the squad bay). there was a large bundle of combination locks sitting atop the crest of this pile, like some cruel game of “figure it the fuck out, you have 60 seconds”. i think i saw my dignity at the base of that pile for second, before a small bespeckled recruit was thrown on top of it, and several mattresses on top of him. i don’t know if i ever saw him again. boot camp is a weird black hole like that. 

at any rate, after some time we eventually got the mess sorted out and it was time for the Senior Drill Instructor’s initial inspection. this was where every recruit (or trainee depending on your branch or preferred term) was to strip down to his underwear and do some funky chicken dance in front of the “chief trainer” for their platoon, just so they could visually (and of course on paper) confirm that you didn’t have any crazy rashes or missing toes. more or less, they’d give you a look-over to confirm that you’re fit to begin training. it was at this point, once the dust had (literally) settled, that my stomach-rock returned with a vengeance. 

here i am, very much mostly naked, save for some very uncomfortable (and offensively white) briefs and some shower shoes, doing some combination of the chicken dance and the holkie polkie, in front of the most studious and chiseled-stone boulder of a man, when again nature came calling. at this point i could no longer ignore the signals my body was giving me. i had no choice but to “do the dance”, verbally, with this grim reaper of a character standing before me, and pray there was some semblance of god on this god-forsaken depot. 

remember when i said the marine corps is *very* particular with their verbiage? this is the part where that comes into play. to the best of my knowledge this is how that exchange played out—

“GOOD AFTERNOo—“ my voice cracked in the middle of the “noon”. to be fair, vowels are the hardest sound to enunciate when you’re *reallllllllllyy* trying to project your voice. they’re very delicate sounds compared to consonants. cut me some slack here. 

Senior DI, on the other hand, decidedly did *NOT* cut me some slack. he was stepping off to give the recruit next to me a look-over when my barely-post-pubescence cut the air in the room like a whip. he froze, impressively mid-step, then reversed himself (this was very cartoonish, really. in the military they call it “drill” or “bearing” or some-such word but it honestly reminded me of a cartoon being rewound. i would have found it comical were i not so literally about to shit myself). he cut his movement, still facing perpendicular to me, then snapped his very shiny, bald, skeleton-like face in my direction. in retrospect this was even funnier, because his name was very musculo-skeletal related. 

the eyes were what got me though. pure hatred burned into the core of my being. i think i saw the fires of Alexandria somewhere in there. red bull factories cried out in anguish. the temperature dropped 12 degrees. puppies were slightly less cute. 

“you wanna try that again?” rock solid stillness. this man was made of layers of stone, hate, and discontent. 

i have almost no shame in admitting that i started to tear up at this point. i want to say out of fear of what he’d do to my poor lifeless body when he was done skull-fucking me, or maybe the sweat my brain decided i needed to keep had finally pooled up to eye-level and i was leaking. either way, my vision slowly went blurry from bottom-up and a knot formed in my throat, which believe it or not, makes it difficult to confidently enunciate. i took the deepest breath i could anyway and mentally prepared for the worst. 

*hhhhHHhHHHHH* “GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR!! THIS RECRUIT REQUE—“ 

*bang* like a gunshot, another crack of pubescence tore through the room. at this point, i’d gathered several onlookers. even a few of the other drill instructors had ceased their fuckery to watch what would become of my surely condemned soul. the room was eerily quiet. not enough audible misery. off in the distance i heard some poor schmuck screaming “AYE AYE SIR!! ATE AYE SIR!!! AYe aYE S-IRRRR!!!”, no doubt doing endless jumping jacks and getting sand kicked in his face. such is life at the Depot. poor souls. 

the mountain-man before me was not impressed. an eyebrow twitched and he half-sighed. 

“one more time, and try not to *f*uck it up.” 

there was an unusual emphasis on the F in “fuck”. 

but my mind had gone. i was no longer Recruit V. i was a caged animal desperate to void his bowels. the sweat beading on my forehead swung from hot to cold to hot in fractions of seconds. every pump from my heart sent that rocket closer and closer to the silo doors. it was all systems go, T-Minus Too Late. 

“GOOD AFT—“ was all i could get out before my colon sent me into spasms. i bent over, trying to regain control. desperate. blind. seeing black. seeing everything. seeing nothing. i saw everything. i saw everything—

It was awkward and confusing, and the teacher said she'd given me ""pro"" and it was my fault, and wouldn't hear anything else, even though I insisted my paper said con. She (and the rest of the class) were visibly annoyed and kinda laughed behind my back about ""my screwup"".

Of course, a week or two later I dug through my old papers and found the sheet she gave me that said con...but then when I brought it back in and showed her/the class, nobody cared because the moment had passed and they were annoyed that I even brought it up again.

5745,"I'm pretty sure this was abuse buuut:

They couldn't eat food unless her boyfriend said it was okay. 

She would ration them to tiny pieces of food to keep them small so she wouldn't have to spend her cigarette money on clothes. Even though, the clothes they wore half the time used to be mine.

My friend blacked out from hunger in our living room and her mom didn't think it was a bad thing. 

She on the rare occassion she'd buy them cake, she would go around and take the icing flowers off of each piece they'd have. She tried to take one off of mine and I tried to bite her hand. 

The starving stopped when my mom stepped in (thank god) and basically was ready to throw fists right there in the yard.


Edit: Different friend but more fucked up shit I remember:

I stayed the night once. It was 80 degrees in the house because the cunt was too cheap to put on the AC, so I was wearing a night gown that went to barely above my knees with short sleeves. Her son wouldn't leave me alone to change, even when I tried to run to other rooms he followed me. When I complained to her she smiled and told me I shouldn't be dressing like a slut then and boys will be boys. I had to wear my friend's long pajamas even though I had allergies to her pets AND my friend got to wear a skimpy night gown to boot. It didn't even go near her knees.

If you weren't Christian AND Vegetarian, get ready for shaming about it any time you sat down to eat. Even though you ate their food without complaint. And just because I wasn't interested in attending church, I was shamed and told I was going to hell by a full grown woman encouraging her kids fucked up ""meat is murder"" nonsense.

She encouraged them to attempt to shame me out of eating meat and actively did so behind my mom's back. I ratted her out when I cried after being served bacon because she kept guilting me about it. A woman in her thirties. I was seven.  My mom had words with her. Not against Vegetarians or Christians, but these people weaponized both. 

Apparently *I* wasn't allowed to have friends outside of her two kids. She HATED hated HATED the fact I made friends with a girl my own age who was actually nice to me and encouraged me to have fun and stood up for me when her own kids tried to harm me.

It was ""boys will be boys"" if her son tried to break my arm but when I hit him back it was ""being a bully"" and ""ganging up on him"" even if he was doing shit like trying to choke me when he thought people weren't watching.

Every instance of bullying and harassment was fine because ""We're religious""

Fake Christians is more like it. They never went to Church unless it made them look good and she built her whole life on a lie.

""Spare the rod and spoil the child"" verse doesn't mean hitting your kids at all. Because the rod wasn't ever used to hit sheep. (Which is the simile in question.) 

The rod was used to hit enemies attacking sheep or to guide the sheep. But it was never used to hit sheep. So it shouldn't be inferred to mean ""Hit your kids to discipline them!"" because it means ""Beat off those who would harm your children/guide your children on the right path."" 


So while a bunch of abusive dicks and people who don't understand the context of it have used it to say ""We can hit kids!"" The verse itself doesn't mean that."

She is a hoarder, her garage is packed with snow shovels and rugs, and according to my mom she has one little path leading to the rooms (she said the path is surrounded with stacks of newspapers and just random shit). 

Our grandma used to babysit us a lot after our parents split, and since we weren’t allowed in her house we would spend eight hours a day driving around in her car. Sometimes she would take us to go sit on the bench in her backyard for a couple hours, but there wasn’t a lot of space to play. Our lunch was usually the McDonald’s dollar menu and water, and for snack she would buy half gallons of ice cream and have us race to see who could eat the most of it, she would get upset if we didn’t eat it all because we were wasting it. She only played Christian music and audio bibles, and would talk shit about gay and black people to us. 

One summer she had us help her build a retaining wall for her front yard (I was around twelve). It was three weeks and we were outside for five hours a day helping her dig a trench and pull weeds/spread grass seed. She would stay inside and come out every hour with glasses of water and grapes or some snack to eat. Only got $20 to do it. One of the days I had to go to the bathroom and asked to go inside, instead she gave me a couple napkins and forced me to go in the grass on the other side of her house. At that point I was so frustrated I cried. She said her house was “under construction” so I couldn’t go in. I’m still a little scarred from that. "

It seemed to me that most of his kills were him trying to find someone that could fill that role, realizing very quickly that they would not, and then killing them as a result. He was noted for attempting to create “zombies” by pouring acid into the skulls of his still living victims. 

Park Dietz, who is a pretty well renowned forensic psychologist and interviewed Dahmer for the prosecution during his trial, stated that he thinks its possible that Dahmer could have lived a normal life in modern times since it would have been easier for him to find a lover online or through dating apps, etc. I don’t really agree with that, but its an interesting thought.

I mean people who don't take responsibility. At some point you do have to start being organised with jobs and paperwork and taking care of yourself. You need to go outside and socialise with people. You need to sleep and eat some vegetables. I know some people who are in their thirties now and they don't have jobs. They live with their parents which is none of my business but they have no plans for what they'll do when their parents are no longer around.

She literally sees an amalgamation of her own species, screaming in agony and fear, forced and forever bound together, not of their own free will, put as some sort of experiment and possibly punishment for Garnet and others rebelling against said leaders.
(this forced fusion is made up of different gem shards, since gems are their ""bodies"" for a human equivalent just imagine like...a mass of peoples body parts stitched together)

Given that fusion represents relationship in this show, it could even have rape overtones but that's a bit of a stretch, although the dark unsettling feeling in that episode is off the chart."

5860,"This episode actually becomes retroactively much more sad, because of how the series ended.

The end of the episode is Ted telling his kids “what he would do” if he could go back to that moment (instead of going to Robots versus Wrestlers). He would go see the mother, and ring her doorbell, and he gives a speech about how they’re going to meet in 45 days. He says how he just wanted to see her, how he wishes he had those 45 days with her, but he’ll take the 45 seconds before her boyfriend comes home.

Knowing how the series ends, it actually becomes really heartbreaking. As much as people hate the ending of that show, knowing how it ends makes episodes like this retroactively better."

I’m in uni studying engineering but as part of my physics paper currently we are looking at quantum physics. 

Some of this shit is so theoretical we are describing it with other qualities to try to figure it out. 

Think of how religions are supposedly stories used to try to understand the world - e.g. Zeus being angry = lightning. We have the same sort of thing in Quantum Physics - take “Colour charge” for example. Scientists observed a system of 3 strange particles (Strange as a noun not an adjective) so figured they had to have another quality allowing them to exist bound together despite violation of quantum physics rules (Quantum number conservation I think). So they named this thing colour charge because it must be like light  - 3 combined colours to make white light. 

We are literally looking at physical principles so theoretical that they are still in their “Describe with other stories” stage rather than having their own names!"

5920,"Probably told this somewhere before, years and years ago, but it's great.

The dream started out like a nightmare, with a vampire coming in through my window. This wasn't a romance-novel Edward Cullen dream vampire but a horrible Nosferatu monster slowly unfolding in the dark to suck away my vital juices. And as in all good nightmares, I was butt-ass naked, covered only in the sheet I slept in. I backed away screaming and gibbering, throwing any and all available objects at the Nosferatu as I made my way out of my house and into the street. It followed, uncaring. I was doomed.

Whereupon a rocket from out of nowhere slammed into its side and turned it into an explosion. There were my saviors: the Mythbusters, armored in nerd-punk scavenged armor and armed with all manner of future-tech fuckery. They told me that they moonlit as vampire hunters, and also vampires were absolutely real. Now that I knew about the real and true existence of vampires, I had but two choices remaining to me: to join the Mythbusters in an endless, awesome campaign against monsters of the night, or to have my memory erased. I, of course, chose the former.

I was swiftly outfitted in my own set of armor, with a jetpack and automatic rocket-launcher, and the rest of the dream was a madcap action sequence of me launching rapid-fire explosives into high-rise buildings and power-fisting vampires into dust and cursed screams. Even now, with the show defunct and knowing what I know about cast relations, that was an the most awesome thing I've ever imagined myself doing.

Second place goes to the dream wherein Nine Inch Nails got back together and played a free concert just for me, if only because this happened a week before Nine Inch Nails actually got back together and I could claim nerdy Nostradamus status."

5922,"Our calendar.

The 12 months part makes sense, I suppose. It's easy to split in half, thirds, quarters.

But the days of the months? What the fuck?

""Ok we'll make some months have 31 days, some have 30, and why not, let's give this one 28, just for the shits and giggles""

I advise people look at [The international Fixed Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar) for a system that makes a bit more sense.

- 13 months (not quite as good as 12, sure)

- Each month is 28 days, or exactly four weeks

- Each month starts on the same day, and ends on the same day. The 15th of every month, for example, will always be on the same day of the week

- 28*13=364, one day short, so to mark the beginning of a new year, New Year's day isn't a usual day of the week. It will go between existing days (E.g. Sunday&gt;Year day&gt;Monday), the same will happen for leap days

If I want to be seen as authoritative, I have a lower voice, with fewer pauses, and try to smooth out my vocal fry. If I want to be cute and get free stuff, I go higher and more southern. I think vocal versatility is a good skill to have. It's not much further from there to doing other accents. I do British accents as party tricks.

Both have been almost completely funded by alumni donations.  I think the final price is somewhere around $40 million for both.

5962,"I know Courage the Cowardly Dog arguably isn't a ""light hearted"" show, but its target audience was primarily children, and it had enough comic relief and wacky scenarios that weren't grounded in reality.

However, there was this one episode called ""The Mask"". The episode was about this literal cat lady (as in an anthropomorphic cat) who shows up, and has a total hatred for all ~~men~~ dogs. Reason for this is because her ~~lover~~ best friend, this bunny lady (again, an anthropomorphic rabbit) is dating this meathead dog motherfucker who basically domestically abuses her (no strikethrough, this is pretty blatant). Courage, being the paranoid moron that he is, helps the bunny lady escape the dog thug and get back together with the cat lady.

Even the episode's writer, John R. Dilworth, has [stated](https://youtu.be/LSaSHDgejFg?t=2m36s) that he has no clue how that episode made past the censors. For a kid's show, it had themes of misandry, relationship and domestic abuse, and homosexuality."

I'd been in love with her for at least a year before we tried a relationship and it lasted a month. Tore my heart out.

A couple years later we got back together, but by then I was too drunk and too crazy to handle a relationship. We were together for about a month. I broke it off because she was too good for me. Which was true. But it's still a damn fool reason to leave someone.

We almost tried again, later, but she basically wasn't willing to keep making the same mistake. Good for her, I suppose. Then she avoided me for a few years and one day contacted me on AIM to ask me if I was angry at her for avoiding me, and when I admitted I kind of was, she told me there was no point in continuing to know each other and that was the end of that.

Either I do something stupid and it behaves exactly as expected (like a plate full of food falling because I put it too close to the edge of the counter), something not doing what it is supposed/I want it to do (more often than not, this falls into the first scenario), or it is there and I'm inconvenienced by it (like the getting caught on a door handle comments I saw somewhere else in here).

Ask if they are going to march in the parade when Pride comes around.  If so, ask if you can join them.

Invite them to non-LGBT events.  Being included ""like regular folk"" is important.  
Be interested in their life.  A lot of LGBT people have a rough past and tend to turn convo away from themselves and onto TV-topics, like Trump or Beyonce or The Avengers.  If you haven't heard much about *them* recently, you should check in.  
Oh, and be around during the holidays.  Some LGBT folks have great families to go home to.  Many don't.  Most of my LGBT friends hold an ""Orphan's Christmas"" because of our relationships to our still-living families.  If your LGBT friends don't seem to have holiday plans, see if you can include them in yours.  "

6027,"It's the idea that your sourdough starter is an active living organism that needs to be taken care of! If you bake every day, you can leave your starter sitting on your counter and feed it with flour and water every day. If you (like me) bake once or twice a week, the feeding schedule revolves around when you want to bake and accounting for that!

For example, I usually just bake a loaf (or a focaccia, or a pizza) a week. That means I have to take into account the health of my starter, as well as both the starter's temp in the fridge AND the ambient room temp in my kitchen — usually I'll take it out of my fridge 6-12 hours before I want to mix it into dough. Then I take part of that starter, add some flour and water, and let it rise for a few hours.

Only then do I add it to the rest of the flour and water (and salt, and whatever extras I want to mix in.) What it boils down to is that if I want to bake on a Sunday, I have to start thinking about these things on Friday or Saturday morning at the absolute earliest!"

It was my lucky charm and I took it everywhere with me. Flash forward to me being 17 and going to a high school party. I had it in the pocket of my leather jacket and I left the jacket at the party. 

I was devastated as it was the only thing I had that was 'mine' from my sister. Looked everywhere, asked anyone who was at the party if they had seen my jacket - it was gone. 

Flash forward to this year, my mum has moved into a smaller house so I have the crate filled with my sisters belongings. I cleared it out and stored it all properly because the crate was falling apart. It was completely empty when I was done. 

A week later we are taking the crate to the tip and just before we threw it into the tip I opened the lid. In the middle of the floor of the crate that I was 100% sure was empty was my troll doll with my writing on the foot that I lost 8 years before at a party. "

6044,"Iowa isn’t required to, either. Barring minors, no employee is entitled to a lunch break/15 min break. Federal law doesn’t say much on the average adult worker when breaks are involved, so anything involving employee breaks is up to the state, and if they don’t say anything, it’s at the employer/company’s discretion. 

A lot of people are surprisingly uninformed about their state’s work break laws, which is sad. It’s important to know what your state has to say on it, so you don’t start a fight with your employer over breaks you (perhaps falsely) believe you’re entitled to.

This time we went to Portugul, the islands where my family is from, and she was doing her thing, bossing people around, rushing us from place to place so we could get to everything she had planned. My grandmother, her mother, was the reason for the trip. She was dying and wanted to go home one last time. It had been nearly 60 years since she left the island for Canada, and we pushed her around in a chair the entire trip. 

My grandmother was very weak, and kept asking us to go to her home village of Maria. It was in the plan, but near the end of the trip, sort of set up as a finisher before we left the island to return to Canada. 

Like the title says I am normally very calm, and I dont raise my voice often unless it's out of excitement or comedic effect. 

I shouted out over everyone, who all wanted to go in different directions, see different places, and eat different food. 
""Holy fucking HARD STOP, HARD STOP, SHUT THE FUCK UP."" That got everyone's attention. I threw my hand at my mother to point her out. ""You! We all appreciate your organization skills and for getting us here, but now that we are here you need to step back a little. We got a dozen adults and a dozen teenagers here, we can take care of our God damned selves."" I waved my arm across the group of my cousins ""you shit socks need to get your shit back in the sack. Your all over the fucking place. Disrespectful ducks. We are here for a family vacation, and when we are done doing our family shit then you can go and play in the ocean."" Finally pointing at my grandmother ""and I thought this trip was for her and grandpa, shes getting weaker by the day and wants to go home. So we are going to load up into those tiny fucking Van's and drive to the other side of the island and put this lady in the ocean now before shes too weak to do it later. Maybe if you stopped ignoring her for five minutes you'd realize you're all being a bunch of fucking dicks to her.""

We silently loaded up into the Van's. I apologised to my mother, cause I know she just wants to help, and we got to the village. 

There my grandmother LEAPT out of the van to hug a 50 year old, one armed, toothless, one eyed man whom she used to BABYSIT, and her neighbor. She was so happy she practically skipped through the streets to show us the house she grew up in, the bench she got her first kiss, and the pools of ocean water caught in the rocks where she would swim. It was magical, but she burned herself out. She spent most of the trip resting with my mother and her sister while the rest of us toured the island, played in the water and got history lessons from my grandfather. 

That was the last week of August. She went into the hospital the day after we got back. She died the first week of October.

I insisted that neither him nor the rest of the trash go anywhere near my car. So he would just leave it for the next person assigned the task. 

We finally collectively decided to leave the trash until he took it out, which led to a months' worth of rancid garbage bags chilling in our kitchen. The only ones happy about this were the mice. He still refused to take them out. So when he passed out from one of his midday drinking sessions, I walled him in his room with Trash Mountain. When he eventually escaped and complained to our employer, they frog-marched him out of our home along with the aforementioned Trash Mountain, giving me my sanity back.  No regrets. "

The best chance you got is to use a shotgun and place it in your mouth at an upwards angle. NEVER point it at your chin. You will survive. You will simply shave your face off. There's some pretty disturbing pictures of failed shotgun suicides out there and most happened precisely because of this. In fact, some of you might remember the famous [Rotten.com](https://Rotten.com) motorcycle picture. It in fact wasn't a motorcycle accident but a failed shotgun suicide.

Man, that'd make him a lot more interesting, if his power becomes a liability because sometimes getting shot at means other people are hurt. Luke Cage ought to care a lot about that, even if the people getting hurt were shooting at him. I'd like to see him develop more in light of his power, like trying to talk down criminals who are desperate and just pulled a gun, or using more stealth even though he doesn't actually need it to protect himself.

I changed my birthday on Facebook to exactly a month later to see if someone would notice. Well lo and behold one month later and everybody was wishing me a happy birthday on Facebook.

6236,"Last fall I was having trouble with physical exertion and throwing up after walking up stairs etc. I thought it was asthma related. 

Went to my PCP in Nov, she did some blood work and said I was a little anemic and we’d keep an eye on things. But wanted me to make a hematology appt for a completely unrelated reason (I did call, but I never got a call back). 

Then I got pneumonia and thought the increased breathing and exertion problems were related to that. 

Feb, saw PCP again and she continued to not be concerned about my blood count numbers. Wanted me to do a fasting blood test, which I finally did in May on my way to see her again. 

She walked in and called an ambulance because I was deathly pale and my hemoglobin was 2.9 and my hcrit was like a 10. Two days and 4 blood transfusions later, I felt amazing and went home. 

Everyone kept saying, it wasn’t cancer and that I’m too young. 

A week later I go back to my PCP who insists I had parvo and that’s what caused the severe anemia and that I had “some” blasts but I’m too young for cancer. 

The next day I go to the hematologist/oncologist for a bone marrow biopsy—-they said I’d been severely anemic since Nov and couldn’t  believe my pcp hadnt been concerned. 

The next day as I was leaving work I got a phone call from the oncologist I saw the day before Telling me to get myself admitted to the hospital because all the signs pointed to having Leukemia. I was then diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia with FLT3 and GATA2 deficiency. 

The doctors said the issues with my bone marrow most likely started as MDS and because it didn’t get taken care of soon enough, it turned into AML. 

I spent the next two months in the hospital getting chemo and now I’m out doing chemo at home and preparing for a bone marrow transplant in Sept.

6239,"Dude I had something really similar happen to me. So for like 2 years I was getting these bouts of rhabdomyolisis (don’t know how to spell it). Just in case, simply put rhabdo is when your muscles break down too much and release myoglobin into the blood stream. Normal working out breaks down muscle tissue but rhabdo is that X100 plus the myoglobin can’t pass through the kidneys which eventually causes death. And the area where it occurred swells like unbelievably). 

So any way, I notice I’m starting to get the rhabdo pain and swelling in my arms. It feels a lot different than lactic acid build up. I was with my mom at the time and told her she needs to take me to the ER. So we get there and no one is really taking me serious because it’s so uncommon. I’m trying to explain that this is the fourth time I’ve had it in the past year and I’m positive I have it. So I finally get a bed in the ER and the doc comes by and totally blows me off. He said I was being irrational or something and blamed it on a muscle strain. To see if someone dies have it all ya gotta do is a simple piss test. Real fast and easy. So I’m begging the guy to just do a urin test. He keeps refusing and gives me 500mg of Tylenol and goes to get me checked out. The nurse who was dealing with me was really cool. So I explained my history, symptoms, etc and he agrees that a piss test should at least be done. So while I’m waiting to be processed to discharged, he hand me a cup, w/o the doc knowing and runs the test for me. Turns out I got myoglobin in my urine so he comes back to draw blood to check CPK levels(type of protein, not really ever supposed to get over 500 units(forget the actual unit they use). The nurse comes back and tells me my CK levels are over 80,000. Levels this high are an immediate health risk that needs immediate action. So I get admitted for 5 days Until the CK #s normalize. 
Another problem with rhabdo is the swelling. It can be so bad that the pressure can cut of blood vessels, something called compartment syndrome. The only way to relieve that is to do a fasciotomy, look it up it’s fucking crazy, which is when they basically slice your muscles down to the bone to relieve the pressure. So I spent the week in the hospital getting my arms measured from the swelling. Turns out I was about a cm short before the docs were goin to perform the slicing and dicing. 

The funny/maddening thing about the whole story. Never saw that fucking doc after he left to discharge me. Even when I was leaving the ER yo get admitted he wouldn’t even look at me. I mean maybe he was having a bad day but whatever it was if it wasn’t for that nurse I coulda died. I knew I had it so I just would’ve went to another hospital but it really made me wonder how many times shit like this happens. "

Tattoos are certainly part of the alt communities, but the rockabillies, rod rod, motorcycle guys and girls really make tattoo artform a huge part of their culture. That's my guess.

Education isn't about using things in the real world, not until tertiary education anyway. In the future, that might be more applicable. But right now, education is about learning how to learn. It still amazes me that it was Malala, the Pakistani girl, who opened my eyes to that. School teaches you how to utilize different parts of your brain, it teaches you how to think faster, better, more critically, more analytically. You use those skills for the rest of your life. 

It's for that reason I still miss Math. I remember how much repetition was needed for me to learn things like trigo &amp; integration properly. And because you have to solve complex problems under exam conditions, your brain learns how to work faster and that honestly extends to the rest of your life, you realize how much faster you can solve other problems. 

And what if you can't solve a problem? Do you persist or do you give up? School builds your character from a very young age. It teaches you resilience, persistence, hard work. Education never ends. It starts with school, schools can lay the foundation of how you learn and what you learn, but education continues for the rest of your life. No knowledge is ever pointless, it's what you do with it that matters.

For example, I've gone out on a double date where the server asks my fiance and I if we would like separate checks, and then walks away without asking the other couple the same question. It's hard not to think that is racially motivated - the other couple ""looks"" like they belong together since they are both white, but we don't because we're interracial. Now, I don't think that the server is racist or being a jerk about on purpose - it just shows how implicit bias makes the server think that we might not be a couple."

6318,"I think pretty much everything. While you might not need to know every detail about the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, understanding the role such pivotal periods played in the development of one's country is important. While history might not repeat itself, it often rhymes as Mark Twain was reported to have said. Another reason why learning about ""boring"" events in history is because it helps people understand the world today. Things like a 40 hour work week, for example. This did not just magically appear out of the ether. A regular work week and rights for workers were things that people fought and literally died for. Understanding that tends to make people more aware of when these sort of rights are being eroded. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff you learn in English classes is kind of the same way. You probably won't need to quote Shakespeare on the job, but having a wide breadth of knowledge is important for the same reason an understanding of history is. Also, the ability to write well and communicate clearly is valuable at all levels of one's career. 

&amp;#x200B;

Math and Science are important because, while a lot of the information becomes trivia unless you're pursuing further education in math and science, the foundations of these courses are not just about memorizing formulas. They teach people how to think in logical, consistent, and systematic ways. People did not always prove something by looking for discomforting evidence, for example. In olden days people would look only for confirming evidence. This is partly how some ancient cultures believed that human sacrifices caused what we now call daylight savings time. The scientific method is not just a model for doing cool experiments in chemistry and biology, it's a model for rational thought."

I know this may sound like a stretch, but if you put everything together, all the records of how much you actually paid in and how much you were credited, you can approach a couple of people to kvetch. One would be the State Attorney General where you are, approaching them under the assumption that you were ripped off (sure sounds like it). The other would be your local congressperson. Even if neither can help you, making them aware of what's happening is a big help to others.

Edit: Or Pinocchio, which ends with the puppet being hanged from a tree until dead. From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio):

&gt; Pinocchio's bad behavior, rather than being charming or endearing, is meant to serve as a warning. Collodi originally intended the story, which was first published in 1881, to be a tragedy. It concluded with the puppet’s execution. Pinocchio’s enemies, the Fox and the Cat, bind his arms, pass a noose around his throat, and hang him from the branch of an oak tree.[7]

&gt; ""a tempestuous northerly wind began to blow and roar angrily, and it beat the poor puppet from side to side, making him swing violently, like the clatter of a bell ringing for a wedding. And the swinging gave him atrocious spasms...His breath failed him and he could say no more. He shut his eyes, opened his mouth, stretched his legs, gave a long shudder, and hung stiff and insensible.""

Buffy basically comes home from a day of vampire slaying to find that her mother was laying as stiff as a board (rigor mortis) on the sofa. I must've been in my mid-30s when that episode was shown, but it still made me cry. I didn't feel anything for the mother, but it was Buffy's reaction that just brought a tear to everyone's eye. She could no longer be the little girl at home and heroic slayer on the outside. The following season was all about her learning to manage household budgets and having to deal with things that she wasn't ready for. It was brilliant because she was growing up with her target audience demographic. Massive contrast to something like Bart Simpson who has been like 10 years old for the past 30'something years."

There's so many inconsistencies, it's almost impossible to work out and triangulate what really happened. They also used their wealth and influence with people in higher positions to cover up the case, suddenly replace investigation leaders with new ones for unstated reasons, hide incriminating evidence, re-hiring different detectives that provides a different answer to a scenario, the media unfairly portraying an overly-positive image of the parents etc

For $7.25 an hour. 

5 hours into the shift I'm exhausted, and we start asking for breaks. We're told ""Oh we don't do official breaks. Just take them when you get time"". That's pretty illegal, but whatever.

6680,When we were dating I’d love to lay there next to him and listen to his breathing as he was falling asleep now some nights I have trouble sleeping and he just has to turn and breathe on me as I’m finally falling asleep and I just want to strangle him 😬 but I love him and I’m sure I do plenty of annoying things. 
6681,"I used to ride horses competitively, specifically show jumpers. When competing on grass, which can be very slippery for a horse with four metal shoes on its feet, we screw metal spikes called ""studs"" into two spots on the horse's shoes in order to help with traction when they're taking off and landing. I used the ""B"" studs [in this photo](https://www.vtosaddlery.com/Merchant2/prodimg/nfstuds_540x260.jpg) for rainy/muddy conditions.

One morning I was putting studs into the shoes of a temperamental mare who was in a particularly bad mood. She pulled her leg up and in to kick, I ducked and rotated to get my head out of the line of fire, and she caught me in my side. Stud went through my shit and ripped a massive gouge in my skin - around 1"" wide, 1"" deep at the deepest and probably 4"" long.

Horse shows are expensive and you don't get a refund if you don't compete, so I grabbed the equine first aid kit, shoved some antibacterial cream and gauze in the gaping hole, put a wrap around my entire rib cage, dipped my finger in some powdered bute and took it (don't do that at home, kids) and rode in classes for the next three hours. Went to the hospital later that night, they put a drain in and stitched me up. 

I scar easily and it healed super ugly. Hoping to get a tattoo to cover it some day."

Anyways, the stuff looks and smells EXACTLY like a can of cat food. But spread that shit on bread with a bit of mayo and it's fucking delicious. High in iron and protein, too. I ate so much of it when I was in Norway last summer. 

I found some back in the States at an international grocery in the French section under a different name. I'll see if I can hit the Googles and find what it was.

6694,"When I was a kid, from the age of 4 onwards, I was best friends with the kid who lived around the corner. I was an only child until I was 11, so he became my defacto big brother. Like, we literally hung out almost every single day, for a solid decade. We were a real Corey and Shawn and we went through a lot together. Friends, girls, school, fights, literal fist fights, but we always came back around to being best buds. We had rituals, like handball in front of my building, trading anime we burned onto multiple CDs, and later Pokémon cards, soft Chips Ahoy and alt rock in his basement room. 

In high school, my mom got a job transfer, cross country. We kept in touch, but it wasn't the same. I kind of wished we could hang out like old times, and even made an excursion out of state during a spring break trip with my new friends, to reconnect with him and the rest of our old crew. We stayed up late gaming  catching up and shooting the shit, and had a blast. But I had my other friends on the itinerary, and this thing with a girl that was just a massive waste of time and energy... it was great to hang for a moment, but that's all it was.

A summer or two later, when we were nearing the end of college, he called me up out of the blue. He had decided to take a cross country roadtrip to hang out for a few days, like old times. My parents were cool hosting him, but they had retired to boring suburbs, so instead, they helped me spring for a hotel room for he and I to have some real bro bonding. We talked for hours, wandered Houston at night, ran afoul of some shady shit, and for one last weekend, we got to be brothers.

Now, both in our early 30s, we live across the world from each other. Once in a blue moon, we reconnect for a bit on Facebook. 

I still kinda miss him."

6734,"Inequality has been a thing for ALL of human history. No qualifier. Before modern times, that gap was nobility versus peasants and masters versus slaves. Nowadays we not only have a plurality middle class (majority in some cases), but the average ""poor"" American has enough food to get fat, slavery is almost completely abolished worldwide, human life expectancy is over double what it was in the middle ages, and infant mortality is almost completely eradicated. Most of this has happened in the last 200 years under capitalism, and most of the rest has come since the invention of the printing press. Equality or not, the world is better than it ever has been before.

I won't say we've solved every problem and there are certainly issues that have appeared in the last 100 years, but to say that inequality is a bigger problem than it has ever been is patently false. You weren't around during the unsafe factory conditions in early industrial society. Quit your bitching. The existence of billionaires doesn't justify complaining about being ""broke"". The rise of the wealthy lifted the poor along with it because the poor are better off than they have ever been historically. Even the homeless.

I would argue that inequality is inherent to the human condition and isn't really the problem itself. Exploitation is the problem and even that has gotten better because of education, individual rights, separation of church and state, the internet, and other means of empowerment."

This was like immediately after id found out she killed him.  The dumbass just stood there and said nothing. I stormed off and left her standing there. I hope she thought about it.

EDIT TO ADD: The principal (and his wife) though did help me out after that.  They made sure I had food and clean clothing.

Honestly, I've never had anyone make a valid argument as to why the Earth is round. Photoshopped pictures of outer space &amp; high altitude pics where people shop in a curve always make me laugh though. 

I remember seeing a video a while back where Buzz Aldrin got called out for lying about the Earth being round by one of my fellow flat earthers and Buzz got so mad at being called out, he punched the dude. How messed up is that? He couldn't provide any facts or arguments, so he resorted to violence. Typical, but kind of expected from an actor who never actually went into space. 

Whenever someone doubts the earth is flat, I just link them this imgur pic. It's definite proof and clearly not shopped.

He tries to contain it because he's literally streaming and doesn't want to seem like an asshole but he can't hold back all the time.

6762,"Back in college I was part of this sports/outdoor adventure club and we did all sorts of stuff. The few active members would have dinner together after our activities and it's mostly mindless college jokes with dumb dares. One time they dared me and my best friend to kiss (and they'd buy us dinner if we did), and we did. I'm not a homophobe but man kissing a dude is *not* like kissing a girl. 
  
The plot thickens as I found out a few months later that my best friend is gay (his then boyfriend had forced him out of the closet when he tried to break up with him) but I took it super well and we grew even closer from that clusterfuck of an event. We still had sleepovers and spent a lot of time together. So during one of our regular dinners with the adventure club, some people who weren't present the last time we kissed dared us to kiss *again* (in exchange for dinner, again). I looked at him and he gives me this 'you know Jay you don't have to do this if you don't want to' look but I said fuck it and went for his lips all the same. Didn't want people to be suspicious of him since, despite the dumb dares, we're still from an intensely conservative society. That free dinner was perhaps the sweetest dinner I've had.

To make matters worse, I had fallen asleep from exhaustion from screaming and crying because they turned off the lights in my room and closed the door.... then they wouldnt let me come out.  I was frightened of the dark and scared to death.  My older sister (8 years old) was in her room, upset that they wouldn't let her come comfort me.  

It gets even worse... the two couples had a guy friend in the house as well that tagged along as the fifth wheel.  They sent him into my 8 year old sister's room to lay in the bed with her while the couples were in the living room fucking.  So my sister laid there, frozen in fear with this strange dude laying in the bed with her while her baby sister was crying for her.

It's a small town and my mother had no problem with making it known what a whore the babysitter was.  The babysitters mom heard this and called my mom, flipping out that she was talking shit about her precious angel.  Mom had no trouble telling the babysitter's mother exactly what they found that night when they returned home.  

......This was back in the 80's so of course nothing was done about it.  But it is one of my first memories that I have.  I remember thinking about how pretty my babysitter was with her big hoop ear rings, and the next thing I know my sister and I are in a nightmare.

What’s terrifying is most of Burroughs’ popular work was written after he got away with murdering his wife while they were in Mexico.

Reading Burroughs with that in mind becomes far more disturbing. The man was clearly remorseful but the act was extremely reckless. His books feel like distraction and delusion - whatever fantasies he can spin to make himself and the reader forget the terrible thing he’s done.

6838,"I get these weird intuitions, these urges to contact people. I don't exactly know where they come from or why they happen. All I know is that it is something that runs in the family. It's almost like a panic attack, when you have that pit in your gut. But with it comes the urge to contact someone. It has always helped people, and has never harmed them. It has gotten to the point where I am so used to it happening, I just automatically speak to the person now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with my best one, the one that is the most memorable for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was walking in the park in spring 2015. I had just sat on a bench and was chilling out with some music and a bottle of soft drink. The feeling hit me, and it was the strongest incidence of the feeling yet. The impulse this time was to call a woman I hadn't spoken to in over a year. We had bonded over some commonalities previously, and I had her number, but we never really progressed past the acquaintance stage of things, for whatever reason. I had my phone, so I made the call. She picked up almost immediately, and I could hear that something was really wrong, instantly, by the tone of her voice. I explained the sudden impulse to speak to her, and she said that it was a really good impulse, then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that she was raped about 3 weeks before. She had just taken a pregnancy test and found out that she was pregnant. She was (understandably) reeling from this double violation. We talked for more than three hours, more than just on the topic at hand, but on everything. At the moment I called, she had been on the verge of committing suicide. I metaphorically talked her off a bridge. We are still somewhat-friends to this day. She ended up having the child as a form of turning what happened to her into something beautiful to be treasured (her words). 

&amp;#x200B;

The next one I am sharing is a little different, as it involves a complete stranger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in the city a few days before Christmas in 2012. I was sitting on a public seat, trying to unwind from all of the social anxiety from the mad crowds in the city. An older lady come and sat beside me, taking the weight off of her hips for a while. I got the impulse and tried to figure out who it was for, before realising that it was for the lady beside me. So I turned to her and the words came to me: 

""Your daughter is going to be okay."" 

She turned and looked at me, thoroughly confused. She stated that her daughter was fine, that she had been to her house a few days earlier. I tried to explain the impulse, but it didn't fly - I could tell she didn't believe me. A few minutes of awkward silence later, her husband rushes up to her, phone in hand, and states that their daughter has been in a car accident and is being taken to the hospital. The lady turns and looks at me, and asks me how the hell I knew. The husband goes from concerned to concerned and bewildered. I tried to explain again, but ended up just telling them to go and be with their daughter. The old lady looked thoroughly unsure of what to do, but awkwardly thanked me and the pair rushed off to go to the hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

This one involves a co-worker at an old job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was working in this telemarketing place (yeah, I know, lol) 2009 and was sat next to a fellow I got on very well with. He was an all-round great guy. Just the sort of dude who lifts everyone's spirits when he starts speaking. Too good for that place, that's for certain. Anyway, he had been having some minor health problems recently, but thought it was all under control. This was until the day he walked in and I got the impulse, and ended up blurting:

""You have to go to the hospital, now."" 

The blatant outburst obviously startled him, because he didn't know what to say. I explained the impulse, which led him to state that he had heard of such things before. He took my advice, called his wife, and went to the hospital. He was in the very early stages of a heart attack. It was caught early enough that he could be put on medications and a stent placed in his aorta to avert it. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I have had many impulses, I've only listed a few, with this next one being the last one. 

&amp;#x200B;

This one was fairly simple, but it has had long-lasting ramifications for many years. It was in the first half of 2010 - I was speaking to a friend on the phone when the impulse hit me. It ended up with me blurting: 

""You have to make peace with your mother."" 

This sent my friend off. He had had an abusive childhood and wanted nothing to do with his mother whatsoever. It took a lot of convincing, but I managed to convince him of the validity of the impulse. He relented and went to see his mother more on the basis of our friendship than anything else. It turned out that she was in the late stages of cancer. It all come out, she apologised for everything and while she didn't beg for forgiveness, she asked him to not let her cruelty and malice poison him forever. He could agree to that, and they talked a few more times. While I would like to say there was some kind of make up, there wasn't. She died two months later. But he did attend her funeral, and it allowed him to let go of a lot of the toxicity that had built up over the years. He states now that I was instrumental to him becoming a much better person that he was, for setting him on the right path. I'm just glad that he come through it okay. "

6873,"Also:

In 1942, the Supreme Court said that the First Amendment doesn’t protect “fighting words,” or statements that “by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace” (Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942)).

In later decisions, the Court narrowed this exception by honing in on the second part of the definition: direct, personal insults that are so offensive they’re likely to provoke their specific target to respond immediately with violence. The Court has also said that laws can’t prohibit only some types of fighting words, like those based on racial bias (R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992)).

And

The First Amendment doesn’t give people the right to make direct, personal threats of immediate violence. This can include intimidating symbolic actions like burning a cross that are meant to make specific victims fear for their lives, even if the cross-burners don’t actually plan to carry through with the threat (Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343 (2003).)

TLDR; if you say something with intent to get someone to fight or make direct threats you arent protected.

In case anyone brings it up, Westboro got away with it because they never made personal threats. As an example the dead soldiers signs never named specific soldiers even if they picketed specific soldiers."

As such, I wasn't really hanging out with a lot of people, I would only occasionally be invited to parties, and then I would just feel awkward. It really did batter my self-confidence for a number of years.

Enter that teacher. While it wasn't necessarily anything he said, it was more that he just treated me with the respect and dignity that a young high schooler almost never receives.

He invited me to a tabletop WW2 simulation game every few weeks at his house. He would take the time to talk to me in the halls. He would review my work, and he was just overall a really amazing man.

Now, a year out of high school, I'm contributing to his book about his dad's exploits in WW2."

6929,"Faith broke for different reasons. Joss Whedon himself said that Faith is what Buffy would have been in different circumstances. 

The start of Buffy's life was a loving mother and father (even if they got divorced, he was still in the picture). Her mom would have done anything for her. She always had food on the table, money for new clothes, and no worries except for teenage drama and homework. Basically, she had everything she needed to develop a sense of self confidence and security. 

Faith had none of that. She was used to being tossed aside. She was used to hunger and pain, an alcoholic mother, a deadbeat father. She was used to getting beat down for all the wrong reasons. She grew up to expect the worst from people, insecure in herself and others, taking what she wanted because she was never given anything. 

When life went wrong for Buffy, when her friends were shitty, she was able to weather it precisely because she didn't expect it, so she knew it wouldn't last. Her friends' shittiness would be temporary, because the bad things in her life always were. Because people never just *left* her. 

Meanwhile, when Faith was treated poorly by those same judgemental assholes, she couldn't roll with it. Rather than Buffy, thinking this was momentary shittiness from normally good people, she saw this as the boot dropping, people treating her the way she'd always been treated before. 

Joss gives Faith a redemption arc in Angel and the comics. As more and more people abandon Buffy, she becomes more selfish, more like Faith was (comic Buffy). And conversely, fewer people abandon Faith. People stick around, prove she's worth something, and she becomes mature, stable, bounces back and becomes truly good. 

They're two sides of the same coin and Joss was trying to show the exact opposite of what you took out of it: that everyone can be Buffy, everyone can be Faith, and everyone can change. It just depends on your circumstances. "

There’s significant homeless population, and that’s a problem because most of the homeless are druggies. There’s little to do for entertainment as most of the businesses are just chain restaurants.

Walking to the shops, I passed a group of teens that didn't speak to me directly but said to each other loudly how they'd kill themselves if they ever looked at me. One of them took a picture of me with their phone, and I became terrified of becoming the newest fate hate meme to go viral.

I've been in a lot of circles where ,""you're not actually bi if you've never had sex with the same sex before."" Was a validated statement.

I have fucked the same sex, but they didn't know that and I still think it's disgusting that anybody would try to remove sexual agency from another person in that way.

Additionally, I've met a lot of gay men who flew into a violent rage because I said ""no"" when they asked for a dick pic.

A lot of gay men act like it's all dicks out all the time in the gay community.

I've met many transgendered folk who screen newcombers into a public group to find out if they're LGBT, then treat them poorly if the person is not LGBT.

Of course, there's always the big problem with straight men groups which are usually worse. The second they find out I'm bi they start acting weird, and making distasteful jokes about who's dick I'm going to suck first.

Truth is, I won't suck any of their dicks or think of any of them in a good light because that behavior is disgusting.

My favorite one is when these two old Asian men came in together, I asked them if they needed help and one of them told me he needed the ""absolute smallest dildo you have"". I led them to the back wall and showed them our smallest. He glances at his friend, who does a small quick nod, and then tells me he needs two of them. I replied by saying if he was going to put this in his butt, he should get some anal lube to make sure he's comfortable. He looks at me like I slapped him in the face and tells me they're both for his wife. I tell him if his wife is going to put it in her butt she should have some anal lube. He yells at me that it's not going in anyone's butt. I say okay and we make our way to the front to check out. We're mid checkout whenever he runs over to the anal lube rack and grabs the biggest bottle we have and slaps it on the counter.

Becoming an adult doesn't mean having all your shit together and stop doing childish things: I still go ""Pew Pew Pew"" at other cars when I'm driving and take two pens and have lightsaber fights with myself.

And in fact, relying on one for it is usually not going to work out well (hence feeling lonely in relationships sometimes).

I made the choice to tell my boyfriend when I went into a depressive episode and couldn't get out of bed or go to work for several days. He was getting more and more upset and almost insulted that I couldn't tell him what was wrong (nothing? everything?) and that I didn't really need him to *do*  anything for me.

We've got our issues but I know he's not judging me for it. 

So for me it's totally situation and person dependent. There are people I was with for a long time that have no idea what all those pills I take are for. The minor convenience of having migraines along with it, I guess. But if it's someone I know can handle it I'll tell them. "

After around three months - the routine is sort of settled in, but you have to keep living your life, and everyone around expects you to be normal.  The first year is all the new 'firsts;' first holiday without, first birthday without, and you keep thinking back to ""On this day last year we were/I was..""

My mom argued with him for over an hour to do xrays. After he finally yields and we do them, he goes ""We called the ER, they're expecting you."" 

I was triaged at ER behind severed fingers and gunshot wounds. The doctors thought my appendix would burst before they got it out, but we JUST made it in time. They said I really could have died if it burst, because it was so severe, and we barely made it to the OR in time. And all of that because my pcp wanted to argue over an xray.

7262,"Smart guy.

I have two cousins that were not that smart, didn’t go well.

One of them is trapped into this abusive relationship. He married her because tradition and family pressures, she got pregnant when he was about to dump her; now every time he talks divorce it turns out she’s pregnant again (they have 3 kids + he has 1 outside the marriage).

This woman has gone so far as to beat herself up in front of the children saying my cousin has beat her. For her last pregnancy, my cousin was going to dump her and pay alimony because he wanted to marry the other baby mama who was pregnant at the time, what did she do? Why, tell her parents (and my cousins’ mom) that he had raped her and that if he didn’t stay she would go to the police and put him in jail.

She tells my nephews my cousin hates them and that’s why he wants to leave; she almost got him fired when she called to tell his boss that he was sleeping with a student (he was not, said student’s parents’ hired *HIM* to photograph student’s wedding).

The only downside is that I dont really remember much of my freshman and sophomore year. I had a lot of fun with my friends and I loved hanging out with them, but a lot of my nights (and a nontrivial amount of my days) end up as a drunken blur. 

It's really, really easy to let drinking get out of control. Everything in moderation is fine, but drinking 4-7 nights a week for four years has definitely held me back, and has made social drinking with my new coworkers difficult. Dont drink as much as I did. "

7316,"The point of the downvote is to drop unhelpful, dangerous or unproductive comments and posts to the bottom. That means that on a controversial topic,two people with differing opinions and arguments both get upvoted a lot because even if 80% of people agree with one,the other is still contributing to the discussion and won't get down voted just because they have a different opinion. 

So for example, if three people comment ""i like dogs because it feels like I have a good friend"", ""I like cats because they're very calm most of the time"" and ""fuck off you morons"" then only the third person gets downvoted because the 2 people at the start expressed an opinion and contributed to the discussion,even if 90% of viewers are extremely annoyed or hate cats. It's explained in a lot of places that the downvote button isn't a ""I disagree"" button but a ""This comment is dangerous/redundant/inflammatory without contributing to the discussion"".

On social media what you are doing is preaching, there is nothing wrong with preaching but you havent earned this audience to preach to it. You just found a heavy traffic intersection and you’re lifting a sign saying “jesus loves you”.

My last week their my students wanted to throw me a going away party in my classroom during lunch. I told them it were not necessary but they insisted, which I thought was a gesture. 

About 5 minutes into lunch no students had stopped by and when I went into the hallway they were standing there in front of another teacher who was telling them they couldn't go to my room. When I politely approacshed my colleague and explained the situation, she tried to stand steadfast and tell me know. Even after I told her they had permission and they'd be under my supervision the entire time, she still said know. Finally, nowing it was my last week, I told me students to go to my room anyway because I wasn't having this shit, and it wasn't fair to my students who'd spent a lot of money on a cake.

7337,"I would call it deja vu, but it isn't. I dream things and they come to fruition, sometimes months or even years later. I get them regularly, they always stand out as a very vivid dream when I wake up and shake off as another wacky dream mocked up by my subconscious. Then they happen in real life EXACTLY how I remember them. 

An example of one is a dream I had when I was about 8 or 9. I was sitting in a classroom while a woman I didn't recognize took role. She had long gray hair pulled back in a ponytail and was wearing a purple shirt and light bluejeans. After finishing role call she says, ""Ok, good. Role is done. Soooo...(she trails off a bit and then looks up at me) how's Emily?"" 

""I say, oh she's good..."" (a bit confused since I don't really know this woman or why she's singled me out specifically.) Then I woke up.

Fast forward a year and we have a substitute teacher in school. She looks familiar but I can't place it. She starts taking role and I notice her purple shirt and gray ponytail. It clicks. I've been in this exact seat, at this exact time before in my dream. Every detail is identical. She finishes taking role and says, ""Ok, good. Role is done. Soooo...(looking up at me) how's Emily?"" Taken aback and confused as all hell I say, ""Oh she's good..."" The woman says ""Oh good! She was one of my favorite students! Tell her I say hi!""

 It turns out she was a teacher for another grade when my older sister Emily went to school here but subbed now since she retired. She recognized my last name and made the connection that I was related to one of her past students. That doesn't explain how I dreamt this moment happening a year before it actually did, which really threw me for a loop.

It's so powerful when it happens. I can't put into words the feelings it brings out while it happens or I know it's going to happen. It's usually 15 seconds or less that I remember from a dream, but it's ALWAYS completely spot on. What people say, the inflection of how they say it, their clothing, the setting, EVERYTHING. Really freaked me out as a kid."

Though I don't know anything about you other than this comment, I get the sense that you're a really good person. I felt like my husband was a good person throughout our relationship, I just couldn't take our dynamic any more. And even after I found out he was willing to change, I was worried that I had so much baggage from our past that I wouldn't be able to move past it emotionally.

I'm not saying the shrooms specifically made him do it, but if tripping is anything within the realm of like being drunk (I've never been high), a small stupid idea probably blossomed into that.

-Several years ago, my ipod's screen broke. It still played music, but nothing showed up on the display. After months of it being like that and me trying every button and thing I could think of to fix it, I realized I couldn't. Then, I decided to listen to some music after reading part of a book on parallel universes and the illusion of time/death. Guess what? My iPod suddenly had a working screen! It worked for maybe an hour, then spontaneously went right back to its old broken state.

-An old friend of mine used to live in the same apartment building as I did, but one floor up and around a corner. She and I hung out a lot. When she came over, she had a habit of being a few minutes late--usually two to six minutes--and wasn't consistent in how late. One day, she said she was coming right down to see me. After waiting for her for about ten minutes, I felt an impulse to open the door. I opened it right as she approached! There was no way I could've seen her or known she was right there given the setup (loud building, thick walls). She freaked out and has been creeped out by me ever since."

And you might well come to feel that you hadn't even really been fantasizing about rape camps at all - you'd just been fantasizing about some cartoon version of them or some connected concept (""carnal hunger"" for instance) or whatever, not anything close to what you now knew as the real thing.  And it would quite possibly feel absurd that you had ever been bothered over having fantasized about something no more real than a cartoon.

I mean I don't know, maybe that wouldn't happen.

7402,"I Ctrl-F'd to find this. It was like having the rug ripped out from under me, then being wrapped up in the rug, tossed in the back of a car, driven around for an unknown period of time, and dumped into an unknown body of water.

I will never, ever forgive or forget this one. Will remains one of my favorite characters of all time and I was gutted.

My mother even called me to warn me beforehand because she knew how much I love the character. She's on the East Coast, I'm on the West, so she saw the episode first. I didn't believe her. I thought it was a bad joke. Then it happened.

I'm so, so sorry that it happened. I always will be. I still have trouble seeing Josh Charles in other things. I feel like he betrayed the character by leaving the show. The writers could have chosen another method, yes, but no method would have even been under discussion if not for Charles exiting.

I'm so sorry, Will."

7421,"I had TC back in 2006.  I felt a lump in one of my testicles too.  Made an appointment with a urologist.  He felt it too, immediately ordered a ultrasound and some blood tests (ironically it’s basically a pregnancy test - HCG in men is considered to be a “tumor marker”).  Didn’t let me leave, waited for the results.  Confirmed that there was a tumor and scheduled surgery for the next day.  

It’s pretty wild to have a doctor tell you you need surgery “tomorrow, or the next day”.  But, what I think will help most guys is a description of what it felt like.  

It was not a bump, or a mole or anything like that.  The best way to describe it is that it felt like a partially thawed meatball.  The outer portion was normal feeing, but when you gently squeezed it you could feel it was firm in the middle - like how a meatball would still be frozen in the center.  "
7422,"If you have an anxiety disorder, one of the common symptoms is the feeling of impending doom/you're about to die. Since your flight or fight system is constantly activated, and since you dont have an actual, real life threat facing you, your amygdala, responsible for your flight or flight response begins to create fake threats and thoughts to correlate with your feelings and sensations.

So combine feelings of impending doom, with no real threat, = the fake threat of being suicidal - hence those thoughts. Its nothing to worry about, however I would strongly suggest seeking CBT to treat and fully recover from your anxiety disorder. "
7423,Ugh. I’m sorry your mom said that. Sometimes panic attacks don’t need a reason to appear. I suffer from an anxiety disorder and it’s tough getting people to understand it.

Also to clarify, the son fell from a balcony inside onto the main floor, but she was hung outside from the patio on the second floor. Her feet were dirty with mud, but IIRC they couldn’t find any of her footprints outside. 

The son was also ruled to have fallen over the railing at his home, bringing the chandelier with him. It’s said he was riding his scooter upstairs (why??) and somehow fell over the railing, hit the chandelier, and brought it down.

And all he was doing was trying to do was not get sent to a group home just because he wanted to make a little extra money selling candy or being a lookout. And he did it without having to deal drugs or do anything really bad. He felt super guilty about delivering that message that led to that dude's murder.

If they were lost and needed to pillage someone else's belongings, I think that the older would realize that he'd need to break 'rules' in order to survive but I'm not sure that the younger twin would.

At that point, I perform an ancient erotic dance ritual, which 90-95% gets her in the mood for congress. We eat expensive chocolates and aphrodisiac fruit off each other’s bodies, followed by another spritz of perfume on my penis and anus for good measure. Then we read to each other passages of erotic literature, until we can no longer contain our urges. This is when the lovemaking commences. 

Edit. Since everyone is asking what happens next.

I enter her, at which point my partner and I share eye contact. I begin to describe the feeling of her body, down to the last detail. This sends her into her first (among many) climax. The act of congress can take up to 3-4 days to fully perform. I keep my hunger and senses sharp by drinking a specially-formulated vitamin drink (Andes Mountain water, electrolytes, bovine steroids). We perform in many different positions, never breaking eye contact. 

Building up to orgasm, she prepares to receive me by saying, “Your seed is manna from Heaven. Your seed is manna from Heaven...”. Climax sends me into the 5th spiritual plane, where I am greeted by my spirit animal, The Alaskan Timber Wolf (I mean, duh. Of course that’s my spirit animal). “Kchangshek” serves as my guide and protector through this realm. I am summoned by the 7 Sexual Elders. I form a circle with the Elders, and we masturbate. It is here we become one with our sexual ancestors, one with the spiritual realm, one with all matter in The Universe.

7495,"Still, the show was about seemingly ""good"" people doing the wrong things for all the right reasons.  Walter White was just trying to leave something for his family to live on.  Mike was trying to take care of his granddaughter.

Mike had a code, but I would argue that it was mostly for self-preservation so that he could continue providing for his extended family.

Walter was ultimately the most corrupted by his new-found power, and everyone else was just in various places on a corruption spectrum.  

They all did terrible things and they and everyone around them paid a price.  I LOVED the show as a thought experiment on morality.  What is right?  What is wrong?  What is good and bad?  Do the ends always justify the means?

7512,"Jumping on to this to tell a story of how friends of both me and my girlfriend, became just friends of my girlfriend, then neither of our friends.

We had not long turned 18 (legal drinking age in the UK) and they all wanted to go out roughly every second weekend. 1 friend, James, would make a group chat organising it with other friend, Rachel, and my girlfriend. When they went out they would ask my girlfriend why I wasn't there. We both established the first time this happened that if I'm not in the group chat organising it, or directly invited, I'm not going to turn up. I don't like assuming anything, especially that people want to spend time with me, and they made the point to my girlfriend that if they invite her they expect me to be there too, which is reasonable, but I said I feel uncomfortable with that and would just like an invite and they said that was fine.


2 years they went out almost every second weekend and never put me in the group chat or directly invited me. I eventually got to the point that I said to my girlfriend that they're either complete retards or are making a point of not wanting me there (We'd repeated the conversation about inviting a few times over those 2 years and they'd never done it) and that I was done with them. My girlfriend said she didn't want it to be awkward if she went out with them, I said it wasn't, but she felt bad so put her foot down with James and Rachel and said that the next time they organise something I'd better be invited or she was done with them too. They agreed and organised something a month away so that I could get time off work and hopefully this night out would help patch our friendship. 

We started organising in a group chat and we decided to go out on a Friday 4 weeks away because it was the only day I could get off and everyone could be there. We started talking again, everything seemed to be good coming up to the day, I was actually quite excited and was really looking forward to it.

The day before the night out, Rachel puts in the group chat something to the effect of ""I'm working til 8 tomorrow and will probably be really tired, I don't think I'll go"" and without hesitation Jake's and her have a conversation like this ""Oh that's shit, can you do Sunday though coz you're off?"" ""Yeah I can do Sunday"" ""Cool so we'll do it on Sunday instead then."" ""Sounds good"" 

I was sitting next to my girlfriend and we got the message at the same time, she looked at me, said sorry, wrote in the chat ""Honestly, fuck you two"" and didn't speak to either of them again for 2 years.

I paid for my own driver's ed when I moved out, my own first vehicle, my grandmother helped me through community college. As far as I am concerned, they can then rely on their son to care for them when they are old.

His mother set the expectation that she didn't plan to save anything for retirement, she would just come live with us when she was old, before we were even engaged. I don't approve of people using their kids as their sole retirement plan and it was important to be clear that was unacceptable to me before tying the knot. "

Anyway, we invited a girl my husband worked with, her bf, and their son over for dinner for a play date with our son. 

We agreed to meet at 6pm.

At 8:45pm, they arrived. Why? Because she refused to leave without her bf who had decided to hit the gym for 2 hours after work for no reason. I still think he was getting his dick wet behind her back. 

When they arrive, i serve the overcooked remains of what would have been perfect scratch spaghetti with mozzarella stuffed Italian meatballs if they'd arrived at 6. They didn't eat more than a couple bites. She had the nerve to comment that the tomato sauce tasted a bit overdone and the noodles soft.

Then I let her come into my bedroom while the men sat in the livingroom and chatted. We had a strict rule: no weed in any room of the house except our bedroom, which was a no-go zone for our son. 

She starts smoking, and then suddenly she begins rambling on about how her bf always gets onto her about recording for instagram. Im nodding along because I'm in ""be polite until you can get rid of them"" mode and not listening. 

She pulls out her phone and starts *recording inside my bedroom* without asking. She fully intends to post the inside of a complete stranger's bedroom on instagram for who knows how many people to see. I'm so shocked and violated feeling that all i can squeak out is ""please don't record my face!"". I have no idea if she did or didn't. 

I finally get rid of them. It's 10:30 and my son is all played out and ready to sleep. I feel like I ran a damned marathon.

There is a major downside.

If you have no kill-switch, then you are dooming yourself to spend virtually all of your existence in the void of empty space. If you are truly immortal, then you will exist even when all things experience complete entropy (all matter ceases to exist).

You'll just be floating around in the complete blackness for all eternity. Assuming you also gifted with eternal consciousness and able to retain memories, then you will be able to do nothing or experience nothing, only think about what once was.

That fate is far worse than death. Whenever people are isolated and deprived of meaningful sensory perception (as you would be in the void of space), they tend to lose it within hours or days."

Yes, now I can remember that night when I fucked you for so long backwards. It was the dirtiest fucking I ever gave you, darling. My prick was stuck in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue came bursting out through your lips and if a gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual, fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora’s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.

&gt;You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over to me with a whore’s glow in your slumberous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover’s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometimes too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling’s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.

&gt;Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better. Write me more about that and yourself, sweetly, dirtier, dirtier.

My good buddy in college and I experimented with mushrooms and LSD together, first time for either of us, and honestly those nights were just as special and intimate as anything I've done with girls before or since. We don't keep in touch as much anymore but when we do we will often reminisce about losing our minds walking around campus barefoot, sitting by the river watching the sunset and listening to psychedelic rock through shitty cellphone speakers. 

Absolutely irreplaceable memories that to this day have really left an impact on who I am as a person and how I think about life."

7703,"I knew the “moment” I was going to share before opening the thread, and it just happens to be extremely similar to yours.

I was a sophomore in high school, and my best friend at the time decided some spring camping up in South Fork, CO was in order. He was a couple of years older than me, and had just gotten a Ford Bronco. Looking for any excuse to get up to the mountains, we took off for a couple of days.

Cut to: we are riding four wheelers around, shooting guns, got a decent fire going and having a blast. Then, it gets dark. And it gets cold. Fucking FAST. 

In the tent, my buddy assures me repeatedly that we’ve got a really good chance of hypothermia if we don’t get down to our skivvies and spoon. It’s so cold that I am scared, like really scared we have screwed up badly. So we spoon. I am small spoon. This trip isn’t fun anymore. 

We made it through the night. Penetration free. I hesitate to mention this story at all, as my friend from the story is now a well known professional athlete, but yeah. It was intimate as fuck.

Of course, they *didn't* do it; the police had made an awful mistake.  Mo hits Curly with an axe, and the Stooges catch the kidnappers.  But it's too late: the baby's dead.  The boys are sent to death row and executed.  

It was a sad episode, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.  Overall, the episode was an unusual choice for The Stooges.  "
7718,"To be fair, geographical knowledge is usually regional, and most people would start with the regions or countries that are relevant to them. For some, it's proximity to where they live. Even then, many Americans I've met can't name or point out all 50 states, and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be able to point out the central American countries. 

Another point of relevance to people is simply what countries are discussed in international news. Of course that is regional too, but broadly speaking, North Korea, US, Syria, Venezuela, China, UK, and Germany are talked about internationally so you it makes sense to know about those places, including where they are located geographically. Honduras and Nicaragua are obviously not top contenders for international discussion. 

Because of that you can't just base your argument on people not knowing where random not-relevant-to-them countries are that they are bad at geography. Look how silly it sounds: ""oh you don't know where Tuvalu and Kyrgyzstan is, and you totally forgot about East Timor, so there's no way you aren't bad at geography. """

7759,"most of the time it is. I tried to research this one and it just keeps leading me back to an Quora online board which cites a history channel show. There is also a bunch of articles written about this unsourced but funny saying citing the history channel show ""how the states got their shape"". The show sources this ""fact"" to local rumors and claims. Etymology research shows the phrase was first coined/written down in 1925 in reference to ""yanking or pulling you chain like a dog on a leash"".

So I guess its authenticity is based on how much you trust ""How the states got their shapes"", which openly states it got this fact from local rumor and legend."

7800,"I'll expand this to cars in general.

1. A new S Class Mercedes is quieter and more comfortable than most people's living rooms and has a sound system that rivals professional setups.

1. Off road enthusiasts have access to every thing from ""improved classics"" like the Wrangler to Land Rover Discoveries and Cherokees that can basically drive themselves on trails.

1. Race car enthusiasts can buy street cars that would be competitive with TA2-class race cars of decades past.  Performance tires are also so much better than they were even 10 years ago.

1. Full electric cars are semi-mainstream.

1. There are good hybrids that besides the Prius.  It might sound stupid to some, but I think it's cool that you can get a car with good driving dynamics that seats four and gets 50mpg.

1. Contemporary Miatas look good now.  I've always loved the car, but previous generations were seen as ""cute"" and ""girly"" when new.  

1. Pickup trucks are fucking amazing.  I hated getting stuck driving my dad's shitty 90s trucks.  They were slow, loud, uncomfortable, and generally a chore to drive.  God forbid you actually needed to tow anything with one.  A modern F150 has tons of power for merging, luxuries, and drives reasonably well.

1. Turbochargers on all the things. I drive an N/A V8 now, but I still think Boost is Best.

1. The Gen3 EA888 motor.  Lots of amazing engines have been developed, but I genuinely think this may be the best ICE engine ever.  It an amazing blend of power, efficiency, dimensions, reliability, and size.  It's as much at home in a sporty economy car as it is in a pure sports car."

So for like 12 years I had to put my pads in a wrapper, wrap that in toilet paper, and do the nonchalant walk of shame to the kitchen trash, which I'd then dig thru a bit to bury it where no one could see it. It's part of why I mostly used tampons, so I could flush them (which I know is bad). 
It's kinda weird why though, I'd ask my mom every once in a while if we could have a small trashcan in the bathroom like every other house ever, and she'd just think it was gross. She only went thru menopause 5? years ago, so she had to do the same thing as I did.
She eventually bought some, because I bought it up (for like the 100th time) one day while talking, and said how much it bothered me, and she was surprised and said ""I'm sorry, I had no idea, I will get some""."

Seeing his face light up as we acknowledge him getting our names “right” is way better than the look of confusion when we corrected him. I like to think it made him feel as if he had more clarity than he thought, that he was still in control of his mental faculties, that he was still capable of remembering people near and dear to him. Anyway, the names stuck. And he consistently called us Tom and Jerry for the remainder of his disease. We thought it was a sign of progress, he was able to retain things! He was getting better!

My bedroom was directly adjacent to the kitchen. She would cook when she came home and turn on the fan to the stove. I woke up at 2am to the sound of her cooking.

Day of the date,  2 hours before my date I got a sudden stabbing pain in my stomach. I collapsed and fainted a few times in my room.  Turns out I had a really bad case of ulcer.
The dude kept calling me and I explained to him I may be hospitalized to which he started to act all cold and distant.

Next week at work, he was ignoring me and I was confronted by a supervisor about work relationships and how I was being perceived as easy.  I realized then and there I was played and how I was able to dodge a bullet.

Guy was a real douche throughout my time with the company.
Years later he found me on FB and started sending me really disgusting messages.  I blocked him. 

**Edit** About my supervisor that confronted me. It was more he took me aside and told me that flirting at work is not allowed. There was a strict no dating rule at the office and that douche saw me as easy picking as this girl with no corporate exp fresh out of college. I really had no clue back then how to act in a corporate setting and I really was thankful though embarrassed with the talk I had with my manager.  Sadly Douche guy never got reprimanded, WHY?  he was actually higher up in management, he became later the GM.

However, when I visit her, she insists that I take my shoes off because, and I quote, ""it will make the apartment dirty."" The first time she told me to do it, I honestly thought she was joking.

7865,"Finland is not a real country. Not only is it not a real country but there is actually no landmass there at all, and the space between Sweden and Russia is actually empty ocean.

Now I realize that this notion seems ridiculous but that is why the conspiracy works, and why people are afraid to speak out against the existence of Finland, so I would ask you to approach the evidence I put forward here with an open mind.

Finland was first created some time during the Cold War between Russia and the West. It was also around this time that environmentalism and the idea of preserving our planet was really taking off, and it is due to both of those things that two of the main players in the Finland conspiracy came to work closely with each other, Russia and Japan.

Japan-Soviet relations had always been shaky at best, but also incredibly secretive. Even as early as 1925 Japan and the Soviet Union had secret deals with each other regarding fishing rights between the two countries, with the Soviet Union giving up much of it's fishing rights to Japan with seemingly no explanation as to why.

These secretive treaties and alliances continued right up until just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made trips to Japan months before the fall of the Soviet Union stating the entire time how the relations between them were improving, even when Soviet relations with the rest of the world were worsening.

In fact the entire past 100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questioned.

Why at the height of WW2, were the battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides?

Why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia?

Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War, despite the major geopolitical differences between the countries, and close geographical positions that you think would cause tensions?

The answer is simple, they shared a common secret. A common asset that worked in both of their favours. And that asset was Finland.

It's unclear when Finland was first thought up, some say it was during the Cold War, and others say it was as far back as the 1920's, but the necessity of Finland is quite simple.

Japan can fish in the region of ocean between Sweden and Russia without worry for environmental repercussions, after all, nobody's going to expect fishing regulations to be broken in a place where everyone thinks there's a landmass will they? And in return Russia get a percentage of the fish to distribute amongst their populace.

It's a simple case of fishing the Finnish Sea, transporting it across Russia, (that was the real reason for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by the way), and then shipping it from the Eastern Russian coast to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products.

This is why Nokia is the largest 'Finnish' company, and it is also why Japan is the largest importer of Nokia products, despite the fact that very few people own Nokia phones in the country.

There are clearly some unanswered questions to this conspiracy that I'll try and address below.

1- What about Finnish people? Are they all in on the conspiracy?

A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they're from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia.

2- What about all of Finland's other exports other than Nokia?

A. Finland's three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn't a viable way to get people to believe in it.

3- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage.

A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It's not like the people flying there would notice.

4- What about everywhere else in Finland? There's a lot to it and it couldn't all be made up.

A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn't need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography.

5- Why do other countries go along with it?

A. At first it was a sign of goodwill between Western Countries and the Soviet Union. A bargaining chip that could be played. But Finland has since evolved to something much more. An idealistic placeholder for what countries should aspire to. No real country could so consistently place first in Education, Healthcare, Gender Equality, Literacy Rates, National Stability, The least corrupt government in the world, Freedom of the press. It's a concept for countries and people to aspire to. But that's where the problems about Finland's existence is disputed. no country in the world can possibly be that good.

6- Why the name Finland?

A. The country was originally made for fishing. What do fish have? Fins. Thus Finland.

7- What about the Finnish language?

A. Look up the similarities between Japanese and Finnish. It may surprise you how similar they are. Which is weird considering the vast distances between them.

8- I'm Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting.

A. I'm not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don't even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I'm simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn't actually there. It doesn't mean there can't be a culture or identity of being Finnish however.

9- This is an enormous conspiracy to keep secret, how could nobody else of realized it?

A. Other people have realized it. But imagine the ridiculousness of the statement 'I don't believe Finland exists'. Even if we did have undeniable proof of something put in front of us we would still hold the opinion that most of our friends, family, and acquaintances hold to not disrupt social convention. It's part of the human condition.

10- What about GPS and Satellite Images?

A. It's manipulated and forged. In the parts of Estonia, Sweden, and Russia that are allocated as 'Finnish zones' the GPS locations are changed to match that of Finland. Satellite images are forged. This is how that part of the world really looks

After fighting with the sensor for a few hours, and it making my baby cry and woke him up from sleeping I had enough. He deserved to sleep and so did I.

He would swim up to where the water fell in, and then let the current swirl him around 3/4 of the way back before he swam back to the start again.

8120,"&gt; Someone would tell you the way you did math was ok, then someone else tells you the way you’re doing it is too slow 

As long as you get the answer, the math you do is good, and nobody should be telling you you *should* be doing it differently.

While giving remedial teaching, I see a lot of students get confused with math. There are so many tricks and shortcut one can learn, yet none of those are needed. Which means you can either learn four methods and know all of basic math (plus, minus, multiplying and dividing), or you can get lost in 30+ methods, don't use the math enough to remember which trick is which, and get completely lost when you start learning the next subject.

Now yes, that huge nerd who loves math(looking at myself here) might be a bit faster by learning all those tricks and remembering them at all times, but thats because that guy wants to use math 24/7, and uses those tricks enough to remember at all times how they work.

The problem is when someone does not understand the ""standard"" method of a particular problem yet, and instead of only making sure that this standard method is learned well, we get teachers giving them different tricks of making things easier. Which doesn't make anything easier for the student who's already struggling to understand the first trick, let alone the ten others."

Essentially turning every place he went to into a shitty popularity contest, totally killing the vibe. I personally knew a couple people in his crowd and he regularly blackmailed them over stupid shit to keep them in line. Don't get me started about the times when Miley was in town. 

Still somehow nobody realizes he's a total creep, the dude is almost 60, well past AARP status, and left his wife of 20+years for a 25 year old carbon copy of her who wears SpongeBob backpacks and makes a living selling face jewel stickers from the 90's. Threw tons of drug fueled house parties full of young questionably aged girls and old preying dudes.

8239,"There are only two types of college degrees.  Degrees where they'll teach you how to do something that someone will pay you to do, and degrees that don't. College is too expensive and time  consuming for degree that don't. 

In other words, avoid majoring in anything in the liberal arts if you don't plan on teaching. I know there are exceptions to that rule, but overall it's a sound approach.  If you can't type your major into [indeed.com](https://indeed.com/) and come up with results, it's probably a worthless degree.  

If I had it to do all over again I'd major in something where they  taught me an in demand job skill. You can spend two years at a community  college, go through the medical laboratory science program, and graduate at 20  years old with no debt and make 50k a year. You can go to pharmacy school  after only 3 years of undergrad at some schools and come out making six  figures.

Did you see the political and intellectual guests that he booked for the 1st season of his new Late Night show?

Colbert had some balls booking these guests that Fallon and Kimmel would NEVER book and said I'm gonna entertain with these guests.

How do you not ""dumb down"" your humor when you have ratings expectations as a major network late night show?  He's done quite well with ratings considering his eclectic guest list that doesn't have to be stacked with A list celebs.

I get that's he's not as funny.  I get that it's super disappointing he and Stewart left basically the same time and there's a void of high end political humor.  But I'm sure not disappointed that he ""sold out"".  He's still by far the most high brow host of a major network late night show."

I can leave my job and try something in a year or two after I have a good amount saved up and if I crash and burn I could go back to engineering. Its not a glamorous work life, it's either super boring or super stressful and the bureaucracy drives me crazy, but that stability will always be there if I need it.

8288,Johnny Depp.  It's not the abuse allegations that really disappointed me.  I'm under the impression that the two of them ad a volatile relationship given her history.

Then there are stories about doing tons of cocaine.  After what happened to River Phoenix I had hoped he'd be more responsible. He's a great actor and I think he'll do well as Grindelwald.

That is never the guy your professor wants to network with.

Ask him an interesting a novel question that can’t really be googled and can’t be understood just by paying attention to the lecture.

Once you get over just standing there, you carry the stuff up there. I'll still handle the talking and interaction 100%.  
Once you get used to carrying stuff up, you say hi to the nice man/woman behind the register. I'll do everything else.  
Once you get used to that, you hand them your card/cash. I'll do all the other talking.  
Once you've gotten used to that, you're almost ready to do the small talk bit.   
We'll get there. Step by step.  
I'll be with you every step of the way, but you have to take those steps. You can't expect to get from the starting line to the finish line in one motion.

Third, drug addiction can happen to people in a lot of ways. You can be slipped drugs without knowing and that can lead to addiction. You can have drugs forced upon you and that can lead to addiction. People who are addicts have different brain chemistry. Some of them are literally not fully in control of their life.

And finally, if someone cheats on you, supplies you with drugs until your addicted, and then dumps you like garbage, then (and here's a hot take) you're probably not all that responsible, and that other person is probably a piece of shit.

A random dead body was found on Somerton Beach in Australia in 1948. To this day, there is no hard evidence linking to who the man was, where he came from, or how he died. The whole case is actually very disturbing considering all the theories into the possibility of who he was.

Need a TKR but I’m too young. Bone spurs all over the place. It all started when I was in 7th grade and experienced severe patellar instability. 

Last time I saw my surgeon (mind you he is well renowned and works with prominent professional sports teams) he flat out said “this is a nightmare, I don’t know what to do” to my face. In writing I have “this is a nightmare” on my exam report.  He sent me off to see other surgeons around the county. 

Yeah..he got it all wrong. Good news, I am very active, tape my knee into place every morning, and somehow deal with it. The pain and arthritis is off the charts but I somehow work through it. I do believe my doctor had good intentions but I can’t even afford my treatments/injections anymore. It’s all fucked.

8431,"This story reminds me of a friend of mine. He had gotten inner ear surgery, which became infected, and the medications that they put him on (antibiotics and I think a steroid) he said made his head feel fuzzy. Around this time he told me that he thought his ex was hacking into his phone, laptop, and other electronics. He claimed to have evidence of suspicious processes running in the background of his computers, phone, roommate’s phone, and even very suspicious phone records and WiFi-router logs that his telephone and ISP couldn’t explain. I had gone over some of his medications with him at some point during this, and I determined that one of his doctors had just started treating him with a new antipsychotic, Chlorpromazine (Thorazine), which is usually not used for treatment outside of mental/behavioral health. It can be used for nausea, vomiting, and vestibular disorders (inner ear), which could explain both why it was prescribed and why it may have affected his state of mind. He had other mental health issues which he was being treated for, which involves several medications with psychoactive effects. He is now off the medication, physically recovered, and no longer exhibiting the paranoid behavior. He never, however, became incoherent or violent, and his theories about his “hacking” ex were never 100% infeasible, that I could prove. My point is, he never lost his faculties entirely.

TL;DR: Mitank may have been treated, for a neurological or vestibular condition, with a medication with psychoactive side effects, such as Chlorpromazine (Thorazine). I have a friend who exhibited possible schizophrenia-like symptoms while given Thorazine for an inner-ear issue following surgery."

About a week later, plumbers were called to investigate a foul odor at the front exterior entrance of the mall’s grocery store. Assuming a pipe burst, they opened up a column to discover the thief... rotting.

It’s believed he tried to hide in one of the columns from the rooftop but fell down, effectively trapping himself in a column, dying while hundreds of shoppers passed by. "

The people behind it were from 4chan. Someone thought it would be fun to really piss the Steven universe fandom and so a group of them banded together to make some (actually suprisingly good) art/screenshot edits of the show.


And the community took the bait hook, line and sinker. Like seriously, it was bloody obvious that the art was made to get them mad. At one point they tried to drag the shows staff into it who all went ""...you do know you're being baited right?"" (Except for Ian, one of the storyboarders. He saw the humour in it and actually used one of the recoloured screenshots as his profile pic for a while.)

Anyways, eventually they got bored so what they did is that they posted a final blog post about how they were shutting the blog down because they were getting harassed and as a ""fat black transgender non-binary person"" they had created the blog to deal with their issues.


And of course Tumblr did a huge 180 and suddenly defending this ""poor person"" saying everyone that hated on them was Nazi scum or something.

8498,"He was my best man. I was asked to be his best man. We were roommates in college. We were neighbors after he convinced me to take a job on the other side of the country after college, in a city where I didn't know anyone but he grew up in. We both just recently got the same hard-to-get dream job for the same company. 
  
  
Suddenly, he ghosted on me. He stopped inviting me to events and parties. I would ask a few times if everything was alright, he'd assure me that they were. I had introduced him to a few friends of mine and even they would get invited. When they would ask him ""Hey, is international_thing coming?"" or ""Did you want me to invite international_thing?"", he would just say ""I'm not sure"" and brush it off. This happened for 8~ months. When I spent a lot of money for his bachelor party just to have one of his friends (someone I don't know or hang out with) criticize me about things that he shouldn't have known about (arguments with my wife, career decisions, etc), I knew that my ""best friend"" had done a lot of shit talking. That's okay, everyone complains at some point about each other, whatever. 

  
  
But when he stopped showing up to mutual friends events (birthday parties, etc) if I was going to be there without explicitly saying it or giving a reason as to why he didn't show up (he actually once showed up early because he refused to be in a group chat, we had agreed to a later time via group chat so he was 20m early, got pissy and left and refused to answer his phone when everyone called worried), I told him that I wasn't comfortable being his best man because there is obviously something going on and that he needs to just be upfront about it, verbalize his grievances and we can deal with them. Instead, he said ""Sorry you feel this way."", then him and his fiance blocked me and my wife on all social media platforms immediately and blocked our phone numbers. Didn't even say what was going on, why he was ghosting, what the problem was, nothing. 
  
  
To this day, I don't know what happened but I started to slowly realize that he was just a selfish person and I outlived his use for me. When he didn't have a place to stay (nor any money), I allowed him to stay in my spare bedroom for 2 months rent free. But when I needed to stay somewhere for 2 weeks while moving out here and low on money, he said that he wasn't comfortable with more than 2 days. He wanted to work out together but our schedules were different. He got off at 5 and I got off at 2, but I'd wait to work out with him if he was for sure going to work out. If he didn't feel like it, he just wouldn't answer his phone and would ignore me until I just knocked on his door and asked if he was still coming. His girlfriend would answer for him because he ""hates confrontations"". But if I had went to the gym after work at 2, he would throw a hissy fit and try to make me feel bad because he's trying to get into shape and wanted me there to show him how to do things, while also refusing to communicate about his gym intentions, ""I don't know if I want to work out until I get home"".   If we did hang out, it'd have to be close to his house or not too early in the morning but not too late, it always had to be to his liking. He require out mutual friends to drive 1+ hour to hang out and when I organized something that was in the middle, requiring him to drive 20 mins and others drive 40 mins, he always would ghost on that and make up a reason literally the day of. I realized that unless it is in his best interest, he doesn't do it. Honestly Brad, if you are reading this, good riddance. "

It’s never outside things though. I mean, it sounds like cliche hippie garbage but joy is a state of being inside you, not something anyone or anything else can give you. 

This isn’t to discount the relief that having enough money or better health or a solution to whatever trials people are going through would bring. This is just in terms of what an individual actually has control over.

8516,"The hardest part is moving out and re-establishing your life. Everything after that is just dealing with the day to day. 

Spend time with friends. Make new friends. Focus on your diet. Exercise. Stick your nose to the grindstone and focus on your job/career. If depression pulls you down, speak to a therapist. Everyone needs a therapist now and then. If you let anxiety follow you for too long it *will* start to cause a negative physical reaction in your body and it becomes harder to shake.

Try not to lean on people too hard and be very careful not to spiral. You will meet someone else eventually and they will make you feel just as good, if not better than the last person. Connections can be forged and you have the opportunity to start something with more potential. Remember that the last one ended for many reasons and it wasnt meant to continue. Maybe the next one has a better chance to succeed where the last one failed. You're wiser now. You know more about what you want now than you did before. You can move forward without making the same mistakes. "

* Same thing, but break your triangle-shape hands by waving both hands apart outward when you kick out your feet. Wait til coming to a stop.

Mind you, my husband &amp; I are in our EARLY 20s with a son, &amp; he only makes enough to support OURSELVES. 

So she leaves, &amp; we're like ""Ok, go to bed. We'll discuss this in the morning."" No. He starts cussing &amp; slamming shit(it was around 1 am, our son was asleep). So my husband tells him to pack his shit, we tried giving him a chance &amp; he didn't take it, so off to uncles house he goes(he's strict). 

Basically my husband &amp; I are shitty people for not letting him throw shit around &amp; not keeping him. My mother was very upset that we didn't let him stay. 

I've never been so mad in my life. IT IS NOT MY FUCKING JOB TO ACT LIKE HIS MOTHER. "

8636,"This exact thing happened to me this summer on a trans Atlantic flight. The attendant was taking orders for dinner and I decided to get what I thought was chicken pasta but was chicken curry. Through the rest of the nine hour flight I could feel my body producing more gas than I could release, even at a constant rate. It was horrible, that combined with the super jumpy lady sitting next to me. On my flight home I was confronted with my nemesis once again but very wisely chose to consume the beer that was filling my ‘do not open-duty free bag’ instead of the chicken curry death that was in front of me. That was a much more enjoyable experience. 

Also protip-if you open your duty free bag on the plane, when in customs at your arrival airport just hold the top of the bag where you opened it and act like it’s still closed. I got hammered on the plane and at a lot of snacks for relatively cheap and the customs people were none the wiser. "

- He needs to go to the financial aid offices on campus... skip the emails and phone calls. Just go there right away in the morning whenever they’re next open. Have a face to face conversation. There should still be time to apply for grants / loans and the people there are usually really helpful.
- He’s gonna need a job if he doesn’t already have one... The band doesn’t count if they don’t have a guaranteed income. He’ll also need a place to live. Use this weekend to create a list of options for both of those things.

For me, the turning point was when I realised that people I knew had taken their own lives because they couldn't bare the idea of not being straight. That's when I switched from ""oh yeah you're gay that's fine"" to ""Hey, that's awesome, because you coming out takes courage.""

If her parents had only loosened up enough to let her date, she would have been bringing home a nice boy from church to meet them. This was at age 18.

8809,"I don’t get why people think high functioning autistics are humorless. We have senses of humor! We just tend to have drier or slightly different senses of humor. Like, I’m good at bad puns, get jokes, find things situationally funny, etc. 

HOWEVER, a LOT of what is presented as “funny” in mainstream movies and tv does NOT strike me as funny because A LOT of mainstream comedy actually reads as “meanness” or “cruelty” or “sadness” to me. (I grew up in the Friends and Seinfeld era and I hate them both because to me they just look like groups of mean shitty people being mean and shitty and I can’t figure out why that’s supposed to make me laugh) 

The humor is lost because I’m like “wow why are people ok with this?”. Like, I fucking REFUSE to watch National Lampoon’s Vacation because of the part with the dog. That that is framed as COMEDY to me is absolutely disgusting, and the fact it was in a mainstream movie and most people laughed at it makes me want to never leave the house again because it proves people are inherently cruel and find cruelty funny. The vast majority of mainstream humor reads like this to me, and it’s actually really upsetting. 

Because of this, I avoid comedy because I never know if something other people find funny is going to actually be really upsetting to me.

But I find stuff like Futurama hilarious, because it actually relies on clever writing and long running set up gags, and stays away from things that read as cruel, bullying or mean. I like stoner comedies because they are almost never mean spirited. I like comedy/horror and comedy/action because the jokes relate to the situations which does not leave a lot of room for things being cruel or mean-spirited."

8881,"That is because the industry is reaching a point where the manufacturing of smaller transistors  at a reasonable price becomes harder and harder.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law

Since 2015 intel has acknowledged that they are lagging behind and that the first year they were behind the curve was 2012.

Another major factor to keep in mind is the fact that the x86 architecture that we use is pretty old and includes a lot of legacy instruction code which makes it less efficient in term of tick speed, die size and most importantly electricity used.

Since the rise of mobile computing and especially smartphone the arm architecture has gained a lot of attention and is now starting to complete in term of raw computational power with x86, arm themselves have released a statement stating that they want to be able to complete with Intel's i5 lineup.

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.tomshardware.com/news/arm-new-cpu-chips,37614.html

TL;DR
Intel is behind Moore's law because making smaller transistors at a reasonable price but we still get increases in computing power by switching to more efficient CPU at architectures.

PS: if you have a bit of time go read on risc-v it's pretty interesting and they aim to solve the current problems we have by using legacy tech."

I snapped my arm in half and fucked up other parts of my arm pretty badly, resulting in a huge clotting in my forearm, so they had to cut it open, the shape it made left it looking like a sickle, but the main chunk of it looked like a shark bite.

8897,"This is because koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them."

There’s going to be a lot of Americans here probably talking about their country’s problems as opposed to Earth as a whole. You asked for an Earth outsider not just an outsider in general. So imma address something that i feel is plaguing societies worldwide (if i can be so presumptuous) 

How isolating modern society is. Your house is just the 4 walls around you as opposed to the people in your life or Earth as a whole. People barely speak to their neighbors. People barely speak to strangers. People are so busy working (whatever that is) that we neglect our own emotional needs a lot of the timed. We have screens that keep us “connected” but none of us really make the effort to come together. We “like” photos but not ourselves. It’s just we’re so glued to other people’s lives, but not our own. Humans are social creatures yet most people only see friends on weekends or not often at all. If an outsider came to Earth it would just seem like a lot of us aren’t socialized to the degree that we should be evolutionarily. 

And here’s the propaganda that the “outsider” would call out: “be yourself.” Or some variation of it: “only you can solve your depression,” “it’s up to you to fix yourself” etc. When there actually is scientific evidence on the contrary that suggests that getting out of depression is more a group effort. 

This would be the propaganda the outsider would point out: that we’ve convinced people that happiness is a lonely and solitary endeavor. "

8935,"One of my coworkers is like that. She's the sweetest thing, really. She looooves talking to people, gets super excited when a client is a bit chatty and is just overall a very nice and social person.

However sometimes you can see the look of surprise/horror in the clients' faces when she greets them by screaming ""GOOD DAY"" at them. And then she'll proceed to excitedly describe all the products that we have when they clearly just want to browse peacefully. Then she'll respond to every comment with ""OH MY THAT'S WONDERFUL"" or ""HOW MARVELOUS"" until the clients are too weirded out to buy anything. Meanwhile she's just too excited to see any of that and all we (her coworkers) can do is watch and cringe silently. An acquaintance of mine even admitted to me that he stopped coming to our store because of her overbearing personality.

I love her, I really do, but she should definitely learn to read the room. Poor thing."

8995,"I was in the service then was a contractor for a few years. Good money, solid gig. I quit to run my own small business. Lost my house, was homeless briefly, had a legit plan to just “disappear”. 

I can see the responses here taking a negative turn, but the struggle was really positive as a life experience. 

I was arrogant, not as smart as I thought I was, and was completely unwilling to ask for help. 

It pushed me into grad school. Got me away from the defense and intelligence space, broadened my horizons, and taught me some goddamn humility. 

It’s been 3 years of reconstruction, but I have a great job again, my MBA, and a perspective that wouldn’t have come without spectacular failure. 

Everyone says “well at least you tried.” That’s really reductive, but it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. Just remember you can always fix it. And you can always try again.

8998,"Hey, i see a lot of ppl suggesting split personalities. i actually have a compliled trauma manifestation very similar to DID and this isn't really how it works at all. Very few people with ego fragmentation have full blackouts, that's a really big myth about this disorder perpetuated by shit like Sybil (most of that was made up) and United States of Tara and all the psychological thrillers that use a very real and rare trauma manifestation as a trope or plot device. I describe it as being like a puppet or my main server is just kinda offline. Best metaphor i heard is that it's like driving a car. Sometimes i'm in the driver's seat, but often i'm in the passenger seat or in the backseat. I can see and hear what's going on, but i'm not consciously processing. I have a regressive mode and a rage mode. the regressive mode is somewhat new and feels like a slightly more articulate version of the rage persona. They've had arguments out loud without me being involved, it sounds like a 4 year old trying to soothe a rabid dog. At first the little voice really scared me but i'm actually able to explain things with it to people like ""hello please call me a cab i am mentally ill and need to go home"" whereas the rage voice is kinda like a baby demon and just howls and sputters. They kinda need each other it seems. i dont know. i'm in a lot of therapy lol. None of these personas have names or self-awareness really, they're just fragments that live inside me. INFS work has helped a bit. 

Did you ever see a sleep specialist ? What you experienced sounds like pretty standard sleepwalking. Hormonal changes, particularly pregnancy, menopause, or the onset of puberty, can make sleepwalking more likely to occur. So that's probably why it only happened as a teenager. My roommate sleepwalks and i've had full conversations with him and had to like, stop him from heading off to work bc i thankfully realized he was asleep and was able to get him back in bed without waking him. Waking up a sleepwalker can be really, really traumatic for the person because they do perceive it as a loss of time / dissociation."

9003,"There's a documentary about this called, ""Do I Sound Gay?"" that talks about the lisp gays tend to have and the female tones of voice they are stereotyped to use. It basically comes down to when we were growing up, we saw men attracted to women but we don't understand why. So we emulated those women. Raised our voice pitch, swung our hips a bit. Things that would make us more feminine. The same goes for the 'butch' lesbians, they want women and women are attracted to men, so they do the same."

9023,"I worked for an attorney for a year, and he represented HOAs. My job consisted of getting lists of delinquent HOA homeowners and sending nasty-grams about how they need to pay their fees, late fees, and now a legal fee or face a lien on their home along with more legal fees. Its amazing how many people bought homes and didn't know the difference between their mortgage payment and HOA fees. I felt the worst about HOA's that slapped their homeowners with additional assessments because of lack of reserves and needing money for a project. Other than that, the lack of education regarding HOA homeowning was surprising.

I don't think some people believed that the HOA could actually lien and then ultimately foreclose on their home for association fees (after taxes and first mortgage). Sorry to be the bearer of bad news...."
9024,"That's part of the joke, because a lot of times the ""book hours"" for a mechanic job are pretty short of how long it actually takes. A job can say 0.5 hours in the book but that's under absolutely ideal conditions with a brand-new car without rusted bolts and stuff."

But I'm homeless, and live in literally the worst place in the city. People die here on the streets somewhat regurlaly.

Perhaps in the future that will change. I would love to be open. I am not afraid of judgement or simple harassment. (Though I fully support those who remain private due to those reasons, as their negative impacts should not be dismissed.)

Perhaps in the future I can be an open advocate and help to  change things so that others like myself do not have to fear being killed for who they are. "

9028,"Yeah, that's a shitty way to get fresh fries. By the time you get your fries, they're going to not have enough oil for the salt to stick to it and you're just going to get unsalted fries and a bunch of salt at the bottom. Likewise, the salt we use has a much finer grain akin to popcorn salt, and the salt packets are filled with regular table salt. The finer salt makes it much easier to stick to the fry. 

 Not to mention the extra time to throw away the other fries and wipe out the salt that the workers have to pay; when it's busy and you wanna be special, no one's a winner. Be like /u/litesaber13, just ask for them fresh and say you're alright with waiting the extra 3.5 minutes, it makes us all (you, the workers, the other customers) happier or at the very least less angry.

While interviewing for the job the manager takes me to the QA Department. All systems go through rigorous QA after being assembled. He informed me that the QA personnel used to get a bonus for every mistake they discovered. I laughed at this. He looked at me like I farted in church. I thought he was joking. He wasn't. The reason I thought he was joking is because even to someone who had, up until then, never built a computer it seemed super easy to ""find"" a mistake. I mean all it takes is a slight tug on a wire to cause a ""mistake"" and get a bonus. I then asked him why the QA Department *and* the Production Department didn't get a collective bonus for the number of parts that shipped. I was hired by the company and worked there for a year until I found something better. Oh, and about 8 months after I started they implicated a bonus for the entire production  and QA team based on the number of units that went out the door. "

A) pour fast and have it glug and slosh all over the place because air is trying to get in as fluid is trying to get out;

B) pour in such a way as the bottom half of the spout stays full but the top bit let's air through, which is brain-achingly slow; or

C) just drill pinholes in the top of the can, which lets gas fumes out constantly and is more hazardous than whatever bullshit safety concern they were trying to address by redesigning the spout in the first place."

The fun bit? At a teacher’s meeting a few weeks later, one of the sticker-free teachers stood up and complained, saying that she refused to support that kind of lifestyle, but because so many other teachers had posted them, she now felt like an asshole. The principal replied, “Good! You should.”, and went on to the next question. "

College degree or not, it's considered skilled labor and usually requires years of training and certificates in a specific field. Whether that training is done in a classroom, apprenticeship, or just a person taking the time to learn it themselves. So unless you want to work a dangerous job like oil rigging or are lucky enough to invent the next flappy bird, expecting to just wander in to a higher paying salaried job with no experience is stupid as Hell. People who believe in that kind of thing are the reason so many MLMs and call centers are able to keep duping people in 'working' for them.

9127,"Not the only time but the first that I remember  At the age of 7 my cousin who is 6 years older than me was staying the night. We were a broke ass family so 8 of us kids were sleeping in one bedroom. She and I stayed up late after the others went to sleep. I don't remember the details vividly. 

What I do remember was a game of hand slapping (the one where you put your hands palm to palm and try to hit the others before they can pull them away) turned into my first sexual encounter. She had put my penis in her mouth and was performing oral sex on me multiple times. Stopping in between to ask if I liked it and wanted to try something different. I didn't know what else to try so I kept saying no this feels good. 

Both of our mothers must have heard us and thought we were just staying up past or bedtimes and they came in to make us go to bed. I know for a fact that they saw what was happening because I looked them both in dead in the face. I didn't even know what we were doing was wrong for a long time after that. 

A bunch of things happened at once here. My cousin pulled back after realizing we had been caught and started apologizing profusely. Her mom took her into the other room reassuring her it was ok. My mom took me outside and didn't say anything. We were put back to bed in separate rooms and never talked about it again. 

The thing that hurts me the most about this is that she didn't get in any trouble at all and now that I'm older I realize if the roles were reversed I would have been in a world of shit. In my multiple experiences, a woman is never at fault in these situations. I know that isn't true but it is my personal experience. "

You said yourself that there's zero percent chance of pregnancy for a few days to two weeks. That statement is itself problematic because zero percent chance says there's nothing to worry about because it's not possible, followed up by a very large range of days (A few, being as low as 3 days, two weeks being 14 days). So the implication is that it's impossible to get pregnant for 14 days after a woman has ovulated... which isn't true in all cases. At best, your statement could mean that there's a 0% chance to get pregnant 3 days out of a month, and those 3 days vary from person to person, and change over time... For someone that doesn't want to get pregnant, the implications of screwing that up are very serious."

We always got there 45 minutes early, and I'd sit in the Sunday School classroom, and read while waiting for class to start. Anywho, I had taken a liking to one of the Youth Pastors. He seemed like a great guy. My grandmother, who had been in and out of the hospital for about a year had recently died, and so I immersed myself in my book to take my mind off of it. The Sunday after she died, I was there, and he got there about 20 minutes early, saw me reading Harry Potter, came and sat down by me and told me that the reason my Grandmother had died was because I was reading books of the Devil. I was stunned for hours. Finally, my sister, who was a few years older noticed something was wrong and asked me about it. SHE then lost her shit. The next Sunday, myself, and my sister and my neighbors, (who had been taking myself and my sister to church, due to my Grandmothers deteriorating health) had a sit down with the Pastor of the church. My sister, who was maybe 11 years old completely eviscerated these people, after they called me a liar. Anywho, I've been to churches since, but I think that twisted my views of the Church. "

9246,"So I was at summer camp for Boy Scouts. There is one new scout who has slight autism, but he can still communicate well enough. His mom does everything for him. He had to go to bed at 8:00 while everyone else was having fun outside. And what stinks is that we couldn’t be loud because she said that her son was trying to sleep. Since I’m an older scout, my friends and I pitched a tent near the back of the site so we could stay up late and talk. Well this lady comes up to our tent at 10:30 and tells us to go to bed. Keep in mind that the lights out time for 13 and under scouts is 11. Older scouts can stay up as late as they want. When I explained this to her she said how sleep is important and you won’t be able to wake up early in the morning. Then I was playing Gaga with friends before dinner and she makes us get into our scout uniforms. First of all, dinner was at 6:00, I had to be there at 5:45, and it was 4:45. I tell her that it doesn’t take me long to get a uniform on, and she tells me not to talk back. I run back, put my uniform on, and I’m back playing at 4:55. So I am playing and about 20 minutes later she tells me to get to the dinning Hall. I tell her dinner is in a little while. She then goes to the scout master to tell him about my bad behavior. He could care less. In fact, he tells her to let us decide when to go. This is scout camp where we learn responsibilities and get away from parents. Our troop was the only troop with 4 moms that went and 3 other adults that didn’t have leadership roles.

There is no reason to think that Derogatis has any kind of profit motive or vendetta. Indeed, he is putting his career on the line. He's done good reporting that's happened to elaborate on the crimes of a celebrity. These are not rumors. These are well-reported, source-checked articles that suggest Kelly has abused young women. "

9277,"Being good at meeting people is a wonderful skill, and you're already winning at least half of the battle.  But the trick to developing friendships is not just meeting people, it is seeing them consistently.  Always try to be making plans.  If you are eating a meal with somebody, don't end the meal by wishing them a good day and leaving.  End the meal by planning for the next time that you will hang out.

In my experience, friends are like money.  It takes money to make money, and it takes having a few friends to make a bunch more.  That will make your life a little difficult at first, but once you make a few good friendships you will find that your social life blossoms quickly.

If you aren't super close with anybody yet then I would recommend setting up a group function.  Invite 3-4 people to go have pizza together as a group, maybe the night after a big midterm when people will be free.  However you do it, just make sure that you don't stop making plans with people."
9278,"I don't drink (enough to get drunk) or do drugs because I'm always teetering on anger. I'm almost always angry and I feel like I do a really good job of dealing with it in constructive ways, and without anyone really knowing I was angry to begin with.

I'm terrified if I get wasted that I'll just lose it. I'm not worried about hurting someone, but it's not a side of me I want to be out in the open. It's nice to get a little buzz when just relaxing at home, though. Hard to get angry with a cat on your lap while you binge watch a new show"

It was a bad time."
9284,"Lots of jealous and rejected men who have attempted advances at married women react by lying about it to exact some sort of revenge. The wife just has to say ""that's not true, you got drunk and tried to kiss me and now you're mad I said no. Now this is how you react, by trying to ruin my marriage because I won't make out with you?!"" and then instantly you have to chose between your wife and your friend. 

People want to say this is a simple cut and dry logical thing, but its not. Emotions and love don't work that way. Hell, a husband can be slapping his wife, and a guy can walk up to stop it, and the wife will turn on the guy for attacking her husband, ""who was only just a little too mad and doesn't deserve to be harassed by strangers"".


Its extremely common that partners will side with each other over others, even when the situation is obvious. Hell, some parents side with each other vs their kid when it comes to accusations of abuse. If parents can reject the pleas of their child to save their marriage, I don't want to be the guy trying to claim infidelity without proof. "

We went once and tried to win, and lost everything, went on once just to have a good time, ended up walking out with over 500 when we started with 50. I always veiw gambling as an experience. I can spend my $100 on a two hour concert, then spend $50 on a fancy dinner. Or I can take that $100 and go to the casino, have a good time for as long as I like and eat there with any winnings or still spend the original $50 I had set aside for food, but regardless I spend approximately the same amount, and have a fun experience. I always assume I will walk out with nothing. Then I'm never disappointed."
9293,"I'm not going to really defend poor performances like this because you do pay good money and these people are millionaires because of it but.

They are human, they have problems and hard times just like the rest of us. I have no idea why you would go on stage like that if you cant handle it, and I don't really excuse having my money wasted like that.

I had the opposite experience over 10 years ago. They werent at the same show but it was the same week, saw Rob Zombie who I had loved since his White Zombie days. He was awful. Abysmal performance, constantly out of breath, fucking up timing, missing lines. To his credit he was active and running around the stage and doing his typical theatrics but it all fell flat.

Manson however fucking crushed it for nearly 2 hours. Singing, crowd engagement, his theatrics, it was all on point. No one in the audience wanted that show to end.

This was in 2004 or 2005 I want to say, so a long time ago surely. Back then I had a lot of friends that had been disappointed at Zombie shows who basically considered Manson's performances legendary."

Yes, new cars depreciate quickly, they also typically have better warranties, reliability, safety features, etc. If you're going to buy a new car and then turn around and sell it in a year, yes that is stupid. If you buy a new car because you know what you want and intend to drive it until the wheels fall off, a new car might be a good choice.

Drunk me decided there was no time like the present and began to hit on her. She was receptive initially, until the conversation led to her telling me she was 32 years old. I didn’t care, and said, “you look great for 32!” Which drunk me thought was a solid compliment. She politely informed me of the error of my ways “nobody wants to hear that. Just say you think someone is attractive; don’t bother with the age stuff” and that was the last I heard of her.

If he was so worried about his conscience I assume he either returned his paycheck or donated it to a worthy cause but I doubt it.

Social media opens you to a world filled with other people’s lives. Unfortunately this also opens you up to constant comparison to those other people.

Feeling like you can’t compete, you start to self reflect and feel like you’ll never measure up to that imaginary perfection.

9427,"Theres a psychological reason for that, which is why I pointed it out. Typically those hard to get over people are abusers. Someone who has abused you makes you feel abdicated to the ego boost they provide, which they provide in exchange for constant validation and idealization. They become addicting because when you dont comply, they know exactly how to make you feel bad, which forces you to need them to 'forgive' or desire you to feel better. They basically lasso your self esteem to themselves. If they make you feel bad enough about yourself, they simultaneously become the only person who can make you feel better. That's why you 'miss' them when it ends. You dont miss them as a person, you just dont feel good enough for anyone else, and need their toxic brand of approval to feel better. 

When you're in good relationships, you dont need that, so you think you're bored, or it's not exciting enough because you're not on a rollercoaster. The reality is you may be getting everything you need but arent giving yourself permission to have it."

The truck flipped several times (the first thing I noticed as it was flipping which clued me in to the accident occurring) and the car veered to the right of the road. The car hit a flatbed construction truck that happened to be parked off the road. After making sure the guy in the truck was ok (he was super disoriented), I sat him down in a safe area. Ran over to said car that collided with the flatbed and had ignited at this point and the engine was burning. The steering wheel had been forced down and crushed both of her legs. Bones and all poking through the skin. I was pretty sure the car wouldn't explode and was already on the phone with emergency. I didn't want to move her as it could have killed her maybe. Luckily the next person on scene just happened to be a paramedic driving by. He helped me with everything and I left after giving a brief description of the accident to police.

When issue #100 came out, I was with my best friend (an avid comic reader who got me into the walking dead in the first place) on a week long trip to the adirondacks in upstate NY. We were so excited to read it that we drove half an hour from the mountains to the nearest comic shop we could find to pick up a copy. We went next door to a burger king, had lunch and read the issue.  After we finished and were left with the panel of Glenn's bashed in head laying in a puddle of blood while Negan and the saviors walk off and he nonchalantly says ""ta ta"" we just kind of sat there in silence. It seriously brought down the mood of our happy fun little vacation. I vividly remember the next day we were floating in a canoe in the middle of a peaceful mountain lake just enjoying the sounds of nature and out of the blue my buddy was just like ""Damn, I cant believe they killed Glenn like that....fuck Negan!""  And then we were speculating about if they would ever get to that scene in the show. Sadly the cliffhanger ruined it but if you ignore the stupid cliffhanger and the flashback reveal. They did a damn amazing job recreating the gore of that scene. All the way down to the eyeball popping out of the socket.

She is completely insensitive and deserves to lose her nursing license.  

Everyone will be in that situation at some point or another.  I had a large peri rectal abscess several years ago that required hospitalization.  The pain was almost unbearable.  But thinking about the staff talking about me like I have heard my fellow employees talk about our patients was almost as bad.

The idea was to see who was the toughest and the fastest.  So we would all wear increasingly tighter clothing and try to lighten our bikes as much as possible.  By the end my gang's tires were so thin and our spandex was practically sprayed on.  
I remember one day when our gang, Streamline, knew we were gonna run into a different gang- Draftkings (come to think of it I think that website stole their name) so we were all at my crib before shaving our legs and body hair in preparation.  An hour later we show up to the usual spot and low and behold there they are, the mother fuckin DK's.  On our stretch of road!

There was an episode where the ""modern"" Turtles fight with the Turtles I watched when I was a kid some 20+ years ago because of some dimension hopping gateway. They made fun of the old cartoons a lot in good fun.

A comment was made that stuck with me. The old Turtles weren't that violent. They beat up foot soldiers, sure. But a lot of it was them laying on the ground, unconscious. Or being thrown into furniture, etc. You never saw Leo cut or stab anyone, not really. 

The modern day Turtles do murder the shit out of foot soldiers. But the foot soldiers *now* are robots, so it's okay to dismember them. It's interesting to see the division when it comes to violence. 

They're rebooting it again and further distinguishing the turtles. Now they're different species, April is a black little girl and Splinter looks kind of like a hamster. A lot of fans are whining about it. My kid will probably be into it, but eh.. from what I've seen it kind of looks dumb."

What this means is that the hospitals now must cover the varying amount of insurance coverage between patients to maximize profits, meaning a lot of added fluff that they pretty much expect your insurance to pay (or, potentially, only charge you if you're insured and they can guarantee they will receive the money).

You now have a bunch of for-profit medical resources in a government system that allows for lobbying to occur (a company essentially using a middle man to somehow fund a politician to push them towards making policies that fall in their favor) - unsurprisingly, change is very slow when the ""right"" fixes happen to cut into the profits of the for-profit hospitals and drug manufacturers."

9817,"Repost of mine from a similar thread:

At the time I didn’t fly with passengers, but these kinda fit the question...

Number 1: Traffic watch flight, taking off at 5:45 am in February. Cold and dark, launching an C172 from a suburban airport next to an army base. About 300 AGL the number 3 cylinder exhaust valve jams open.

For you non-mechanical types, that means the engine loses a lot of it’s power output and shakes like an earthquake while blowing spurts of fire from the exhaust pipe. Very scary shit in the dark when you’re not fully awake and only have one engine.

The plane stopped climbing at about 500 AGL and was shaking badly enough that I couldn’t read the instruments. Reducing power settled the vibration somewhat but wouldn’t allow me to maintain altitude. The direction I’d departed put me over a suburban area rather than the army base, which has lots of open areas used as firing ranges (those would be idea for an emergency landing) so losing altitude was not an option.

By very carefully easing around to the west I was able to line up onto another runway at the same airport, land downwind and taxi clear. Shut down, set the brake and had myself a nice little panic attack. Called into the traffic studio and let them know I wasn’t flying today.

Number 2: I was flying a wildfire detection flight in an L19 Bird Dog. 1,000 feet over the forest, looking for smoke columns. The horizon was clear, but I started to smell smoke. The procedure when that happens is to turn 180 degrees and check behind/under you, in case you missed one. About halfway through the turn, I spotted the smoke I’d smelled.

There was a bright white trail of oil smoke leading right up my flight path to my plane. Ever see a plane at an air show that could generate smoke? They do that by spraying an oil mist on/into the exhaust system. The oil vaporizes into white smoke. By leaning my head out of the window I could see engine oil running down the side of the fuselage. Lots of it. What wasn’t being vaporized by the exhaust system, anyways. Checking the GPS showed an airport ten miles away, so I turned that way immediately and called into dispatch to inform them of my problem. At four miles from the airport, the oil pressure gauge was about to bottom out while the engine temp gauge was bumping the red line. I told dispatch that I may be landing off-field and to send someone to help. (They had rangers on their way to my general area already) Crossing the airport boundary fence the oil pressure wasn’t registering anything and the temp was maxed out. I was close enough to glide the last little way (landing assured) so I shut down the engine and opened the door. (The slipstream holds it mostly shut, but it speeds up evac if it’s already open. Also, it could become jammed if it’s closed during a crash.) The landing was uneventful, I was out of radio contact so I called dispatch on the phone and told them I was safe.

About two minutes later a Forestry truck fishtailed onto the airport. Those guys got there fast. Another plane was diverted to pick me up, and we pushed the L19 to a tie down spot and left it overnight. We returned the next day with a mechanic. The oil cooler (basically a small radiator that uses airflow to cool down the engine oil) had ruptured, and 9 of the 10 quarts of oil had been pumped overboard before I landed.

Two instances in twenty years / 5,000+ hours isn’t bad at all, I think."

McDonald's in Brazil has kiosks that only sell ice cream.

Bob's is [well known for its Ovaltine shakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovaltine#International_appeal), and Brazil has the world's second largest Ovaltine market next to Thailand.  Brazil's Ovaltine is super good because of a manufacturing defect that makes it crispier than other countries' Ovaltine.

9902,"My mother is a child. And I don't mean a child at heart. I had to learn to do taxes as freshmen in high school because she didn't know how to and still doesn't. I had to cook and clean the place. If she didn't feel like eating what I made,  she would go and buy herself something to eat. For herself only. And she always bitched me put before doing so for being such a horrible person for not cooking things the way she liked or wanted that moment and yet food had to be ready when she got home from work. I was *always* the one cleaning. And never the way she wanted it done. Even though she never even lifted a finger to help. I'd also be bitched out for cleaning not the way she liked it done. 

I had to wash and clean her car (I didn't own a car until I was an adult). 

She would put her hand to her head and pretend to cry when I wasn't doing things the way I was supposed to and when I was told what a horrible person I was if I didn't apologize for whatever she decided this time it was that I did wrong. Then she would throw herself on the bed and cry for how horrible I am to her and how ungrateful I am at all she does for me.

I spent a good chunk of school time in Saturday schools for not getting to class in time. (The teacher hated me and would close the door in my face just as the bell rang even though I couldn't get in because she was in the way) when one time my vice principal, in charge of me, wasn't available and the principal decided to get me instead she decided to blame me for everything (the principal) saying that if I didn't fix my behavior I would be put in ""special kids like"" me school (juvy).

9929,"Tl;Dr: had a very bad ""danger"" vibe from my ex's friend, he tried to convince me to become a sovereign citizen while he harmed his toddler son for trying to distract me from his message, only realized what a sovereign citizen was later.

My ex dragged me out into the country to meet a friend of his that he hadn't seen since high school.  On the way there, he was telling me about how Friend was down on his luck, living out of a hotel with Friend's Mom and Friend's Son, and struggling to find work.  He told me he suspected that Friend had PTSD after having been in the military during the early part of the war in Iraq so was struggling to readjust, yet again, to civilian life.  He was incredibly happy Friend was back.

We pull up outside of a Subway in a small Texas town and Friend appears.  He looked homeless.  His clothes are baggy and ill kept with tons of stains on them.  His hair and beard are long and unkempt (sort of a John the Baptist in the desert thing going on).   He made erratic movements and talked like he was Leo from That Seventies Show (except his topics were rather...off kilter and not so innocuous).

I got a bad vibe immediately and started paying attention to him without being so obvious.  I chatted breezily, turned slightly towards him in my seat to be polite, etc.  When we got to the hotel, I blew my ""breezy, trusting"" bit to hell by jumping higher than an electrocuted cat when he reached for his card key.  

We get up to the hotel room and Friend's Mom is there, looking like a woman who had possibly done meth at some points in her life.  Her cheeks are sunken in. Her hands are shaky. She's so small and skinny that she's practically swimming in her clothes.  Her hair hung in limp, dead curtains around her wan face.  She greeted us effusively enough before pulling my ex away to go smoke outside.

As my ex left, he mentioned to Friend that I was in law school (probably to give us something to talk about).  I was on edge, trying my best to appear natural and okay in case I offended, and also very cautious about where I sat or what I said.  Friend hears about my law school and his eyes brighten to almost a feverish amount.  Suddenly, he's pulling out a laptop, telling me how exciting it is that he finally gets to talk to someone about this ""stuff"" he""s into.

At this point, I want to bolt.  I text my Ex, but his phone is in the room with us so it just buzzes helplessly on the second queen sized bed.  The sound wakens a four year old curled up in blankets that I hadn't noticed before.  He's dressed in a nightgown with long, curly hair and gets very excited upon seeing me.  I got the impression that they didn't often get ""guests.""

So, this kid starts acting like, well, a kid.  He's wanting to show me his toys (he only had a few, but he was very proud of them), wants me to stroke his hair and cuddle him, gives me hugs, etc.  Meanwhile, his dad, Friend starts whipping through presentations, documents, books, folders, etc.  At one point, we watch a speech from a former lawyer who is insisting that the United States is not a real government (???) and we debate law.

Note: at this point, I had no idea what a Sovereign Citizen was.  I just knew I wasn't buying the bullshit Friend was trying to sell me.  The more I deny what he's saying or recite history, the more frustrated and angry Friend gets.  Son is floating around the room, wanting my attention, and Friend starts swatting at him, irritated that he's competing with Son for my attention (yo, dude, it wasn't a competition.  Son wins hands down).  He grabs Son roughly by the arm and twists it at one point, leaving Son crying and me, heart pounding and fearful, trying to rectify the situation by distracting them both.  I pose a question to Friend about his ""stuff"" and start rubbing Son's back.

At that moment, more than any other, I am made acutely aware that I am a 5'0"" tall girl basically alone in a hotel room with a fanatic who is beginning to hit his child for being, well, a child.  I have no idea when my ex is going to come back.  I have no idea how long I'm going to have to keep up a happy charade of interest.  I just know I fucking want out of there ASAP.

Finally, Ex gets back, a slightly worried expression on his face.  By this point, Son has gotten spanked, pinched, shoved, swatted, etc, while I've tried to keep the two apart and distract them both.  Should I have done more?  Yeah.  Could I have?  I don't know, because I honestly don't know what Friend would have done to me.  I was afraid that anything I did was going to make it worse for Son.

I cheerfully greet Ex and we leave.  Once we were in the car, two miles away, I broke down sobbing, explaining what happened and having a panic attack.  He was truly concerned and admitted that he had wanted to spend more time with Friend's Mom when it had suddenly dawned on him that Friend had turned into someone he didn't really know anymore or recognize.  And he had just left me in a hotel room alone with Friend.  It had made him so nervous that he had tried to speed up what he was doing before running back up there.

We ended up having a huge fight over the Son's welfare, during which Ex admitted Friend's Brother (who I had met and very much approved of) would probably take Son in.  I said he needed to call CPS, soon, because what Friend did to Son was not okay.  Later, found out about sovereign citizens and got even more pissed that Ex had put me in that situation."

You guys had a sitting US congresswoman shot in the head during a live speech just a few years ago.

There was also that white supremacist who murdered his girlfriends entire family and a toddler just a year after that. 

And then a few years after that there was that thing in Phoenix where that guy murdered his family over some business thing.

Terrorism isn't a problem because Arizona has extremely low population density, and its largely a desert which makes it difficult to move from city to city. 

A few cowboys strapped with hip shooters aren't going to do much if a guy in a white van with explosives decides his own life is less important than the cause, that's for certain."

9951,"Pros

- *Substantially* less expensive tuition.
- Text books generally cost less.
- Smaller class sizes.
- More access to your professors.
- Get an AA and in most states you can transfer *anywhere*.

Cons

- You don't really get the ""college experience"". It feels like 13th grade.
- Less class offerings. Some classes not offered at all.
- Less specific programs.
- Far less extracurricular activities clubs, sports, etc.
- Less to do on campus. Mostly due to size.
- Less Notoriety. It's sad but true, certain schools carry with them a certain amount of weight in their degrees. 
- Less expansive Alumni programs. May seem small but I know several people that got their jobs in part because the person making the hiring decisions went to the same college as them and they could talk / relate about it. It's stupid, but it *does* happen."
9952,"There’s actually an episode in twilight zone (spoilers!) that is kind of like this. There’s a rich gentleman’s club and a certain man there is always boasting and bragging and generally just running his mouth. One of the senior members bets him something like 500k that he cannot remain silent for an entire year. Although humiliated, the man accepts the bet (he says that he needs money to pay for the expensive tastes of his wife) and agrees to live in a small glass house which is built inside one of the rooms of the club so that people can observe him. There are also microphones placed inside of the house to monitor for noise.

Well, the man actually does better than anyone would expect. When he’s about halfway there, the older member who made the bet starts to get nervous because he’s worried about losing and offers to pay something like 5k if he'll quit early, but the silent man refuses. Over the coming weeks and months, the older man taunts him by telling him, among other things, that his wife was seen with another man, but the silent man holds steadfast and firm in his resolve.

More months pass until, eventually, he succeeds. After he exits the glass house, the silent man holds his hand out, as if to accept payment, without saying a word. The older gentleman confesses that he is unable to pay, and that he’s sorry for letting the farce drag on. He is humiliated in front of the other members of the club and voluntarily leaves. But before doing so, the silent man grabs hold of him with tears in his eyes, and shows him a written message, still having not spoken a word even though his time was up. The message said that he knew he could not hold up his end of the deal and maintain silence for an entire year, so he had his vocal chords severed."

10032,"similar story. had a really shitty roommate my first year after college. his shittyness included alot of the typical crap roommate things including theft of booze, pot and cigarettes that happened on a near daily basis, asking us for money to pay our share of the bills and then using that money not on bills (we each had certain bills we took care of, he had water and gas, each of which were turned off twice in the year we lived together.) and generally never cleaning are the just of it without getting too deep into other stories. upon moving out he took 2 of my duffel bags a pair of very expensive sunglasses and nearly all of my cookware, and that's just what he took from me let alone the other 3 roommates. despite his general shittyness and all of us being pretty vocal with how we felt about him he felt as though we were still friends, and invited us all to a pretty large housewarming party (i would guess 40-60 people in a small house) myself, the other three roommates who had lived with him and the person who took his old room who was a friend who had heard and seen all of his bs went to his party, stole back everything he took when he moved, or at least everything we could carry. i pissed under his bed and to add insult to injury dumped his booze, crushed his cigarettes and took his pot to make up for the several hundred dollars worth of them he had stolen from me over the course of the year, and we were home by 11. depending on my mood when i look back on it its either the best or worst thing ive ever done. today i feel good :)"

The issue with this was that a lot of people were late by a minute so there would be about 20 in line to get a tardy note to even be allowed in class. Basically we were more late to class because we had to go get a tardy note. One time I was 15 minutes late to class because I had to wait in line!"

Machines run 24/7 unless they break down or need maintenance (or if we are so short handed we cant run them all) and you cant leave a machine unless you got someone there to cover you. because the machines are simple robots that cannot be told 'hey gotta take a piss'.

Leaving your machine unattended results in product hitting the floor, and once it hits the floor you cant even regrind it to reuse it, it becomes trash, and costs the company money."

10065,"&gt; ""Well, if you believe the so-called experts...""
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah motherfucker I do, because they've got decades of education, experience, and libraries full of data to back themselves up with. Your contrasting opinion is based on a cursory, one-time interaction with one subfacet of the entry level of this thing, and even that you had no basis to understand, or else it's based on what you've heard second-, third-, or further-hand from someone else to whom all of the above applies. I'll also add that it's not a coincidence that the experts you're trying to deny came to the opposite conclusion as the one you'd prefer to believe.

But this doesn't mean you should never be skeptical. Experts get it wrong, too, because they're human. Think about all the experts supporting the sugar industry, the tobacco industry, and then there are the experts who are anti-marijuana. Oh, and how about the experts who said homosexuality was mental illness?

10071,"Stop looking at the end goal as the only step.

Man I really wish this reply wasn't going to get buried in this thread because I also went through this existential crisis recently. Shortly after my 28th birthday I had an epiphany and that epiphany was to set goals. Not big over reaching goals like ""I hate being an office drone and wish I was doing something I love!"", that's not realistic for most people and for a lot of people who do get to do something they love, they end up hating that thing and make it even worse.

No, set attainable goals that work you towards your ""big end goal"" and DONT put a time limit on these things. So you want to be able to do something you love? Okay well baby steps. 

Most likely that won't pay overly well, so what do your expenses look like now? Is there debt you need to clear up? Then there you go. Goal 1, put all your attention on paying off that debt. Go home and make a budget and a plan to actually get it done. Follow your payments, track your progress, give yourself props when you make a big payment. Take pride in the fact that your plan 
 is working. Next look at the expenses you're going to need to cover? If that job you love won't cover it then you'll need supplemental income. Goal 2. What can you do for supplemental income? Good options would be some sort of investment that pays dividends or a property that pays rental income (although that's not very liquid). Maybe a some sort of business on the side. Start thinking about those options while you work on Goal 1 and by the time that's done, you might have some ideas up your sleeve for goal 2. Right now Goal 2 might seem daunting but once your debt is paid off, or your savings are at a certain point, it won't seem that crazy. This is just a poorly flushed out example but I'm just trying to show that if you split up your objectives in life into smaller goals, they become more manageable and you get more satisfaction from attaining them. It also allows for your goals to change and adapt to whatever happens in your life. "

Here is how the call would go...""Christian...Christian...Christiannnn...Christian..pick up the phone.."" this would go on throughout the day and each call would be the same. This kid must have slept in all day well any high school kid would, I would if I could have gotten away with it. This was obviously an answering machine that I am guessing could be heard echoing throughout the house when no one was there except the kid. Day in and day out she would call all day long. It got to the point where I was hearing her call out to this kid in my dreams. When this kid started back to school she would call at exactly 330 on the dot or he would call her. Her words would be, do your homework and clean up the kitchen when you are done. 
The other child worked and would have to call her on his way to his break, on his way back from his break. She even went to his job just to buy food to check in on him. Every day...
I have a strong feeling that they will need to ask mother for permission to do anything even to have relationships or even grow up and be on their own. I can picture it now, the kid is at a job interview and is asked if something is okay and they say hold on let me ask my mommy first. "

10225,"People that define themselves as a “Good Christian” are almost uniformly terrible people. When you start your identity with the assumption that you are a good person, then any behavior is acceptable because no matter what you’re a “good Christian”.

There are plenty of Christians that are good people. But if someone introduces themselves as a “good Christian wife” or some nonsense, then I’m extremely wary of them. Their ass better be in soup kitchen every week or something if that’s how they see themselves. Having kids and being submissive to your husband is not the same thing as being a good person. "

My first memory of my dad was skinning my knee very badly and my mom having to help me. How does that pertain to my dad? Well I guess she was supposed to be meeting him for something and I made her late. I remember being in her arms in the bathroom, just winding down from a good cry, and my dad storming in yelling and angry and shoving her so hard she had to hurt herself to avoid dropping me. I have Cerebral Palsy and was a tough kid despite my small size, but mom has always said that was the absolute last straw and they divorced when I was two years old. I don't think either of them know that's my first memory.

This is actually two fads. In the late '30s and early '40s it was hip for teenage boys to wear yellow corduroy pants.

But if you were really hip, you never washed them. You let them get dirtier and dirtier and wore them till they fell apart. If you were the ambitious type, you artificially dirtied them. The joke was that they should be able to stand up by themselves.

And the worst thing that could happen was for your mother to wash them.

Edit: changed '80s to '30s.

EDIT/MORE INFORMATION: On further research I've found that the ""dirty cords"" fad was in the '30s, though yellow cords were still hip later, especially with the college crowd. Yellor or light brown cords could be used as ""dirty cords,"" and if you were really with it, you wore them with a clean white shirt.

And people who do it on purpose. Plan it, often sober. They dont feel really guilty and do it over and over again.

Many people that I know have cheated on ""accident"" (its still not justifyable thats why im putting that in quotation marks) and most feel guilty. They are not doing it again for a long time.

I'm not saying I wouldn't want to know, it's just extremely nuanced. And there's a good chance it ends up worse for everyone involved. If they're good at hiding it, you likely won't find any proof, so if the marriage fails the friend will likely get blamed for ruining the relationship, you will forever wonder if you made a mistake and sabotaged a good relationship, etc.

And if the marriage doesn't fail then either you lose a friend because you think they lied, or your relationship is strained with either wife, or friend, or both because you don't know who is lying.

The only way it ends up for the better is if there's clear proof she's cheating and you get out of the relationship. Otherwise it's just like dropping a nuke."

10319,"Actually the Moba inception goes way deeper than that. It's a long story so take a seat.

It all started with a Starcraft map called Aeon Of Strife. In this map, you played heroes and were fighting waves of creeps, similar to current Mobas.

It was, however, WC3 and it's powerfull engine that allowed the Moba genre. It allowed 12 players on a map (as opposed to Starcraft's 8), scripting your own abilitieas, on top of hero leveling, item shops and a powerful engine.

MOBA or DotA style maps were rather popular, each featured it's own set of heroes, spells etc. What we know as DotA today was a compilation of heroes, made by Icefrog and his team, called 'DotA Allstars', that would put the best heroes, skills and mechanics together. Needless to say, DotA allstars gained huge popularity and sprung the genre of DotA.

League of Legends was the first to monetize the idea. Being free to play entirely, no P2W mechanics, made it burst in popularity in Asia and US. Many other MobAs tried, even before it, but ultimately, it was LoL free to play model that gained popularity and made the MobAs what they are today.

A little less known history here; LoL garnered a lot of hate, but not for that reason alone. You see, Pendragon, head modder of LoL was also the head of the DotA Allstars community. He owned the biggest forums and, by using the forums to advertise their game (and eventally killing them) it split the DotA community; some went to play LoL, some hated it for what it did.

DotA2 came a little late, but with the financial power of Valve, managed to become the head competitor of LoL. DotA2 enabled mods and has become an even more powerful tool and gives modders a lot of freedom with the Source engine.

There were other competitors, Smite, Gigantic, Heroes of Newerth, etc. All had their own small tweaks on the formula, but they could not stay relevant. Heroes of the Storm made a few notable improvements, which even DotA adopted, but it fell flat.

And thats pretty much it."

10329,"Agreed, history is written by the victor. But I have to disagree with Ned being an exceptional swordsman. He was a good soldier, a good swordsman, but not exceptional. His talent for fighting laid in being a great general, and a good leader for his men. He was as able as most highborn boys who have trained to fight since they were old enough to hold a sword - better than average, but he was certainly not gifted. Sure, fighting is a large part of that image, but the show amped up how good he was a LOT. Having him look rather comfortable against Jaime Lannister, potentially the 3rd best swordsman IN HISTORY, was a stretch too far for me. And Jaime wasn't as good as Ser Arthur Dayne, either. Jaime idolised the Sword of the Morning, and wanted to be him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree that Ned beating Dayne isn't beyond the realms of possibilities, and in fact, it happened. Regardless of how he achieved the victory, the only thing that really matters is that at the end of it, Ned was breathing and Dayne wasn't. However, Ned as a swordsman, 1 v 1 with the Sword of the Morning, gets eviscerated, 10 times out of 10. I believe you're right, that there is enough of a belief in Ned's ability to win fights that he could've taken on Dayne, because as far as anyone else knows, it wasn't a 1 v 1, it was a 7 v 3, and nobody ever knows the order in which people died. So to everyone bar Howland and Ned, the details are always going to be fuzzy. And Ned capitalised on that, said the bare minimum to satisfy inquisitive minds, held as close to the truth as he could without dishonouring  his companion and the man who saved his life. 

 All of this leads to your final point - plausible deniability. Ned deliberately never confirms or denies any rumours or gossip regarding himself, Jon, and the Tower of Joy in general. He says he killed Ser Arthur Dayne, and he would've died if it were not for Howland Reed - both of those statements are true. When discussing Jon to Robert/Jon himself, he says ""He is my blood."". Again, technically true. But surely he'd refer to Jon as his son rather than his blood? It all leads up to people not knowing what is, but also not knowing what *isn't.* If people don't even know if something isn't true, how can they possibly work out what is?

&amp;#x200B;

I think Ned is a great character, because of his apparent one dimensionality. He appears to be the noble food, dying in vain for honour, but in reality, he is far more grey. He was a good man, an honourable man, but he has his share of red in his ledger. But his red is for the greater good. Not for selfish gain. And thats the difference between him and a lot of other characters."

10372,"Here is the bands statement after they found out about him. 

Earlier this week, we learned that the allegations of child sexual abuse against Ian were true, and that he would not be contesting them in court. Until then, we found them extremely difficult to believe and had hoped it was all a mistake. Sadly, the true extent of his appalling behaviour is now impossible to deny.
Many of you understandably want to know if we knew what Ian was doing. To be clear: We did not. We knew that Ian was a difficult character. Our personal relationships with him had deteriorated in recent years to a point that working together was a constant, miserable challenge. But despite his battles with drugs, his egotistic behaviour, and the resulting fractures and frustrations within our band, we never imagined him capable of behaviour of the type he has now admitted.
We are heartbroken, angry, and disgusted at what has been revealed. This is something that will haunt us for the rest of our lives. Being in a band has always been a labour of love and a platform to inspire people, not to take advantage of them. It's still hard to believe this is happening and that someone we were once so close to has destroyed so many lives, lying every step of the way.
Our hearts go out to Ian's family, the fans and friends he betrayed, and most importantly, the victims of his crimes and others like them. We hope for justice, but also that Ian will truly take responsibility for what he's done. We would urge any other victims to contact the authorities.
Jamie, Lee, Luke, Mike and Stu

To add to this I believe when they continued on as a band under a different name they brought up the 'elephant in the room' at their earlier concerts.

I was never a fan of Lost Prophets, but I do praise the remaining members of the band being able to continue with their career and treating their fan base with the respect they deserve. 

This situation is scary in that he was in a position of power due to his celebrity and was able to travel to many different countries. He is the definition of a wolf in sheep's clothing.


Apparently he hasn't changed one single bit.

I dry-heaved so hard I shit my pants, then when I took my clothes off in an attempt to fall into the shower and wash myself, I got the shit on the bathroom floor - might I add that my friends and I were on a road trip staying the night in this dump of a cabin with a CARPETED BATHROOM. So once I was showered, I had to scrub my own shit out of the horrible bathroom carpet. At that point it was a good thing I didn't have anything left to puke because I was dry heaving due to the smell.

10395,"I'm not entirely sure I agree - but even if I did, such fan-fiction would at least have to get the core motivations of at least some of the characters right.

This one had:

* Zeus as analogy for Christian father God, instead of Rapey McGee. I get why they downplayed the rape, but the only thing Zeusy about this version is the occasional thunderbolt. 

* Hera as loving mother of Hercules. I'm sorry, what the fuck? Hera is the primary antagonist in the original stories (and every modern retelling of them that makes sense). Zeus fathered Hercules by raping another human (same origin story as most Greek heroes), and therefore Hera hates the child and wants him dead. She sent the serpents, she sent the Hydra, she drove him mad so that he killed his family, and so on. 

* Hades as the villain. Another Christian analogy. Hades is not Greek Satan. At least he was entertaining I guess.

* Hercules motivated by fame, and never murders anyone. If there's one thing I remember from Mythology Hercules, it's how often he murders people for no reason. It's pretty much his defining character trait. 

Those are the main ones. I get why most of them aren't really Disney's tone, but if they'd at least kept Hera as Hercules' main antagonist, that would have helped a bunch. Having Zeus+Hera+Hercules be a happy nuclear family unit was about the worst Disney adaptation choice I can think of. And I can think of a few."

10410,"I am married. But in the last few months I have found myself in a situation where I met someone I could not help but fall in love with. I feel awful, I feel like such a horrible human being it’s beyond what I could explain, so I’ll just explain how I feel and how I’m coping. 

I met this man at my place of work, and it was the kind of connection you expect to hear about in books and movies. Instantly, we could talk, and joke. I hadn’t realized how long it had been since I’d really really laughed, until he made me. He felt it too, to the point where he told me, after an hour and a half of knowing me, that he thought we had to have been soulmates in another life, and I agreed, despite that neither of us believe in that, or at least I didn’t used to. 

We came up with a reasonable excuse to exchange numbers, at the time I don’t think either of us were trying to make things go any way, but they just did. I found an excuse to text him about something not involving work, then he found an excuse. And then he didn’t bother with an excuse, he just texted to talk. Things flowed better than I thought was possible, the kind of banter and connection and conversation that I truly only thought happened when it was written dialogue. Pam and Jim, Micheal and Holly, Han and Leia, a true and absolute connection of the soul that I didn’t believe in. 

Things progressed, and it became obvious within a few short weeks how strong we bonded, and the sexual attraction was there, and powerful. We too quickly discovered a chemistry and sexual attraction that overpowered both of us, completely. We never slept together, but there was plenty of sexting and phone sex, mixed in with conversations I’m sure will be burned into my memory for life. We learned about a master/slave dynamic that was new to us but came so naturally and opened both of us up to sexual pleasures and awakenings we didn’t know we had or needed. 

He’s married, and has a child. I’m married, with a stepchild. So it became too clear that this could never be what we so desired. As hard as we tried we could never be just friends, it always turned back to sexual conversation and a desire to just talk all day and night. So we’ve stopped, we’ve stopped seeing each other. He stopped coming to my work, and I stopped getting drunk or high and texting him. I still have this stupid crazy desire to find a way to go to his work, and just spend the day with him. I cope by having mental conversations with him, telling him all about everything he would find hilarious about my life. Imagining how it could be if we had found each other in time. I’m just holding it hope for our next life. 

Sorry for the long comment, I’ve never spoken to another human being about any of this, and never wrote it down in any way out of fear of hurting either of us. So I guess you’re helping me cope, too, Reddit. "

My guess: it wasn't necessarily premeditated. I'm not saying they looked at her one day and were like ""yep, we'll kill her sometime"". But I think, being that they both were/are(?) doctors, with three young children, they were under a shit load of stress. So, maybe they thought they'd go for a holiday to chill out a bit and get away from work. So they get there and Madeline starts misbehaving. Maybe she was having a tantrum, or was refusing to do as she was told (the way kids do). Maybe she wouldn't get out from behind the couch (where her blood was found) and her parents just snapped and killed her.

In answer to your question: if there was any motive, it'd be because they wanted fame and perhaps even more money. Why Madeline? Because she had that defect thing in her eye, which (you'd assume, and as it was proved after her disappearance) was a prominent talking point during the search to find her. I mean, even if you look her up on Google Images, there's multiple pictures of her eye. "

10491,"Cut it into small pieces and grind it up into very fine metal/wood/paint dust. Mix the dust into melted glass, and drip the glass into marble-like spheres about 6mm (1/4"") diameter. Coat each of these spheres in a thin layer (1mm) of more glass. Swallow a couple of spheres every hour or so, with water. Ideally they will pass all the way through your digestive system without difficulties. Assuming 1g of material per sphere, and 50kg total for the door and the glass, and you can swallow 3 spheres per waking hour, say 50g per day, that's 1000 days to get it all down.

If you modify your toilet to extract and collect the spheres again, you can then melt them with some more glass into two molds of the original door, with space for adding handles and hinges, and use them for the doors of your art studio."

Quantum mechanics is theories involving atoms and quarks and all that stuff. It’s really weird and abstract and just generally fucking complicated. It’s the theory of the very small.

Both of the theories have been tested and seem to be holding up, but they appear to be incompatible with each other. If we can figure out a way to combine the two theories, it would lead to a whole shitton of scientific advances that would basically lead us into a new age.  "

10532,"Yeah there's a lot you can do for the SAT. The SAT isn't really a hard test because the CollegeBoard openly lists out the concepts that they're testing you on and there's enough practice and free tests online that it's basically impossible to get a low score if you put in the effort. 

If you want to get a 1520, I would DEFINITELY recommend timing yourself for every section you do. You want to spend as little time on sections as possible while training yourself to become highly accurate with a low amount of time. I timed myself to do reading passages in 7 minutes and would just check whichever questions seemed kinda sketchy to me at the end of the test. This gave me as much as 20 minutes to read over my answers. 

The next tip somewhat contradicts what I just said, but the SAT is meant to trip up people who go through the test really fast and don't pay attention to detail. Whenever I did SAT practice there'd always be one or two key words in the harder questions that are meant to tell you whether it's B or C that's the right answer. The trick I used was that I annotated my test by underlining key words such as absolutes and I always made sure to underline who the speaker / context was behind a passage. If you're doing the SAT essay for example, the context is VERY important and will allow you to attain detail beyond what is necessary. Annotate the passages as well, underline what you think is important. The strategy for me was to look at the context (e.g. written in 1868, aka post Civil War) -&gt; look at the questions -&gt; read &amp; annotate the passage -&gt; answer the questions and look at annotations instead of reading the whole thing. 

The math portion of the test is arguably is the easier portion since you can just practice the fundamentals listed in either [this page](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/sat-test-description), which is formatted for the layman reader, or [this page](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/test-specifications-redesigned-sat-1.pdf) which goes into depth behind the things on the test. For the math section, I would say if you don't understand the question, try to rewrite the question (physically, if you can't do it mentally) to make it easier for you to identify what they're asking you to do, what's missing, etc.

Because the anti movement is never fucking satisfied.

It started out with controling a few select guns -- automatic weapons and short shoulder arms.

Then they rolled back carry and defense state by state

Then it came to regulating handgun weights and ammo types available for sale

Then they made it a crime to stop for gas on your way to the range

Then they made it a crime to ship firearms by normal mail

Then they decided you couldn't buy a gun outside your home state

Then they decided to just close the automatic weapon list forever

Then you couldn't build certain types of guns unless a certain number of parts were made in America

Then everything had to have a ""sporting purpose""

Then you couldn't import guns from random countries

Then you couldn't import random parts from random countries

Then certain parts had to be made in America

Then you had to wait to get your gun even after being background checked

10601,"Some notes on OS architecture and security.

In 1988 Microsoft saw the writing on the wall for MS-DOS and hired Dave Cutler of VMS fame to write a new operating system from scratch; Windows NT. Windows NT from the get-go supported many things we consider standard in operating systems today: privilege separation, memory segregation, multiple CPUs. As the successor to the DOS-based Windows 3.1 was being developed the original intent was to use NT. Only, there was a slight problem; NT had mammoth system requirements for the time. It also worked with precisely zero existing MS-DOS applications that businesses depended on.

So we got a compromise: a new Windows that used MS-DOS as both a bootloader and an API. This would basically be an OS in the vein of Windows 3.1 that worked tightly with DOS yet took the reigns from it when it had to so you can develop 32-bit preemptively-multitasked applications. You may remember this as Windows 95. 

Windows 95 was a big score for compatibility and cost, but a huge loss for security and stability. See, in 32-bit land, Windows 95 ran the whole show, but DOS still was in charge of much of the 16-bit world. If a 32-bit application crashed, it could be safely killed and you can move on with your day. Only, it took years for most apps to be developed as 32-bit. That 16-bit app decides to take a shit? Your entire computer froze. Designing around this would mean breaking 16-bit compatibility, so the decision was made to keep it.

The Web was also brand new, and with it, the short-lived optimism that it wouldn't be a security nightmare. From the days of Netscape every page is basically a small computer program thanks to JavaScript. Unlike modern operating systems, Windows 95 ran every program at the same ""Administrator"" privilege level, meaning everything from Solitaire to drivers could potentially read and write kernel memory. DOS underneath was never designed to do battle with a constant onslaught of internet intrusions. It allocates memory but does not say which applications can access it. Reading any passwords in memory was just a browser exploit away. It's still possible today, but much harder thanks to modern privilege separation.

Further compounding the stability and security issue was the prolific use of the C programming language. In 1995 this was the only real game in town, in fact, it was viewed as a huge step up from BASIC and Assembly. But it's a nearly 50 year old language that's too easy to fuck up when you use it. Forget to terminate a string or clean up a pointer? There's no warning or error; it just carries on mindlessly until everything blows up. And remember how I said any program could read any part of memory? Imagine a malfunctioning game steamrolling over your drivers. The entire system crashes. 

So newer programming languages like C# took the edge off instability as well; string handling is automatic, memory management is automatic, and there's a bevy of included utility libraries that are highly tested.

By the time the NT-based Windows XP was brought to market in 2001, compatibility with DOS was finally ushered away and with it, marked improvements in both stability and security. The subsequent addition of the NX bit, ASLR, and more C#-developed applications make computing a much more pleasant and secure experience."

They saw him slapping one of the other kids and saying how their parents didn't love them and were trying to sell them. That was one of the more minor things the kid had been accused of doing. They are pretty sure he shoved another kid down and broke his arm.

They apologized to everyone the kid had ever been around. Both for the kid's behavior and for them being stupid and denying it. As far as punishing the kid, they took everything except the dresser and bed out of the kids room making it almost like a jail cell. That was over a year ago and he still just has the bed and dresser. He's gotten much nicer, but it's hard to tell if it's a act or not."

I stopped going to youth group when I was 16, but for some reason this homophobia lingered. 

All it took was my boss, who was very open gay man, to tell me his story about coming out. He went into detail about being in the closet and putting on a front until he was 25. He had girlfriends and sexual relationships with girls but never enjoyed it. He said it was the most uncomfortable thing in his life. He knew he liked men, but where he grew up, homosexuals would get the shit kicked out of them. In fact, he even participated in bullying homosexuals just to cover up his own preferences. It probably helped to be 6'2"".

Once it was somewhat acceptable to be homosexual he came out to his mother. His mother, to his surprise, was very accepting. She knew him better than anyone, and even told him she had her suspicions but was going to let him come out in his own time.

He talked about how it was like a huge weight was lifted off his back. He could finally take off his mask. He said his life got so much easier. He told me how unfair it was that a preference of his, which affected no one but himself, seemed to be such a big deal to everyone else when he was growing up.

That was the moment it clicked. While I may have different preferences than someone, doesn't make them bad people. They are just people with different likes. It would be like if we all started having an undying hatred for people who eat broccoli (sort of like we do with people who eat pineapple on pizza?). It ultimately doesn't matter.

This is supposed to reflect on the severity of the situation *ahem* downstairs. The person pointing out the comment to the officer as a meme probably intentionally misinterprets it as OP checking out a minor. So a person checking out the sham-lam-doobly of a minor shows that OP is a pedo, in a fun manner of course. Thus, although I agree with how the meme is used because I frequently use it as well with no repercussions, I have to disagree that he DID use it correctly. BUT, the misinterpretation of ""Minor really"" is not solid and conclusive evidence of a pedophilia joke because of it's phrasing. If it was ""He was a minor really"", this is clear evidence of a pedophilia joke. It is definitely not a good example of how to use the meme, but it is still valid and within the ballpark. If I were to say, the meme was used correctly but on very thin ice. Thank you for reading :)"

10871,"About a year ago my friend and I had just moved into an apartment together. We worked at the same daycare together and her shift started an hour and a half before mine. 

One morning, as she was walking out the door to go to work, I woke up to change my laundry to the dryer. I went to the bathroom and then went back to the kitchen. As I was walking into the kitchen, I heard some loud banging on the door. It sounded very urgent. I walked half-way across the living room before stopping dead in my tracks. Something told me not to open the door. I almost went to look out the peephole to see who it was, but something told not to even do that. I quietly turned around and walked back to my room. 

Five minutes later, I got a call from my roommate. The guy that lived next door to us had walked with her to her car asking questions about me and her the whole time. Then, when she opened her car door, he attempted to rape her. The only reason he stopped was because someone had walked past them. 

As soon as he left her car, he walked back to our apartment and began banging on the door and calling my name. We know this because, after almost being raped, my roommate called her sister who was in her room to tell her what happened. The sister looked out the window when she heard the banging and said it was the neighbor. He was calling my name and asking where my roommate was. 

Had I looked out the peephole and seen it was him, I would have opened the door for him. He thought I was home alone and would have probably raped me. I’m so happy I listened to my gut feeling.

This article summarizes the three issues.  They found a Meredith's broken bra clasp on the floor of the apartment with Raffaele's DNA.  There was a blood stain in Meredith's room that had her blood and Amanda's mixed together.  And there was a knife in Raffaele's apartment with Meredith's DNA, though Meredith had never been in Raffaele's apartment.  

&amp;#x200B;

None of this is strong evidence because Raffaele and Amanda were in the apartment a lot and could have had their DNA mixed in with stuff.  The knife was retested for the the retrial and no longer had any traces of DNA remained.  I think the contamination via Amanda and Raffaele could be possible or that it was a borrowed knife from the apartment.  They never proved it was used as a murder weapon."

Saw him again there a few weeks later, my friend asked him about the pancakes and he said he was really confused when he woke up the next morning and that his friend had to explain to him how breakfast was already in his pants.

His wife, frustrated by him apparently ignoring her half of the time but hearing mostly fine otherwise, took him to a hearing specialist to be evaluated.

What wasn't predictable about his hearing loss was that the pitch range that was measured (by machine, mind you) to have the greatest loss aligned *very* closely and narrowly to the measured pitch range of his wife's voice.

Yes, she made him get hearing aids."
11073,"I'll just cross post this from a post that asked about something similar.

Completed all three math credits, didn't need a fourth for senior year. I was looking forward to taking a break from math and spending time in choir.

Instead, my guidance counselor put me in an unnecessary math class. I cannot overstate how much I didn't need this class. I had all my credits available. I passed all my previous math classes. *I did not need this fucking class*.

She put me there because she was concerned that when I eventually took math classes in college, it'd be harder for me to understand and deal with. The fact that it should be my choice did nothing to change her mind. My mom was initially on my side, until she met with my counselor to give her a piece of her mind. Then she walked out of my counselors office and told me to deal with it.

He was, hands down, the worst fucking teacher I've ever had. Either in college or outside of it. And I once had a college professor who not only did not show up for the first three days, but also based his lessons off of whatever the headlines in the newspaper were the day of the class and the quizzes were just vocab words. But back to the worst teacher I'd ever had.

This guy would spend 30 minutes on a lesson, step back, declare ""That's not the right way to do it"", erase everything he'd written on the board, spend the last 15 minutes of class teaching the ""correct"" way, and then give us fucking quizzes that counted towards our grade the very next day. No amount of complaints fixed anything because the department and the principal specifically allow that to be done.

Predictably, I, and most of the people in this class as well as others, started to fail the class. Halfway through the year, I started going to one of those tutoring places. The first time I met with one of them, they stated that he was teaching the absolute hardest way of learning to do the problems, proceeded to teach me the easiest way to do them (which I fucking *excelled* at, thankyouverymuch), and helped me with homework, and test prep. I took the next test, and failed.

Naturally, I was very confused. I did it the way the tutors taught me and I'd gone over the review sheet *extensively* with them for weeks. I didn't even get partial credit for my work or my answers. I asked him what had happened, if I'd done them wrong somehow.

This cunt, this asshole, this wet sock on your foot equivalent of a human being, looked me in the fucking eyes and told me that it was because I hadn't done them the way he taught in his class, he'd marked it all wrong.

I've never come so close to decking someone before or since and I'm not entirely sure what, exactly, kept me from doing so right then. I can only imagine that God actually is real and decided that he needed to intervene and prevent me from punching this guy in the face.

No amount of complaints worked because, again, everyone in the administration allowed this. They knew it was happening. They outright allow it. They let the teachers have that freedom.

I spent days, weeks, months, outright fucking crying every goddamn night because I just *could not understand* the material. I poured my soul into studying for this class, and I'd still fail. Not even by a little bit, just outright failing. And my mother would scream at me every night, which added in to my stress.

It's a weird feeling when you suddenly wake up one day and feel nothing. No stress, no worry, no joy, nothing. I entered a state of apathy. I stopped caring. About anything. Idk how I did it, but I can only imagine that my body decided to just shut down for survival by instinct. 

The first thing I can remember feeling after that day was about four months later and it was relief. See, I'd been worried from the very start of the school year about college. I knew if I failed my *unnecessary* senior year of math, I probably wouldn't get into the college of my dreams. I'm happy to report that I did. However, the acceptance letter basically stated that if it hadn't been for my high score on the S.A.T., that my grades for my senior year of math would've kept me out. Basically, my worst fear had almost come to pass.

It' been six years since I graduated high school and I still don't feel motivation for anything. It took me months to be able to actually feel emotions again, and a couple of years before I could worry about something without being bedridden for the next day, no matter what it was.

If you're reading this Mrs. Croke, Mr. Franco. I hope you both die in a fucking ditch. If I ever see you two being mugged in a parking lot somewhere, I'll encourage the mugger to steal your cars.

11077,"Super top secret trans info here:

A lot of trans people do conform to that'i've felt trapped in the wrong body my whole life' thing,

but some, and quite possibly most from what i've experienced, have a much more complex relationship with their emotions and don't fit so neatly into that little box. With suppression, and different levels of body or social dysphoria, the trans experience can be quite different from person to person.

Now cis people, have this way of generally misunderstanding, or just refusing to learn what gender dysphoria feels like, which i admit must be hard on your end, I can attempt to explain it if you want.

Because of this, the therapists/psychologists (mostly cis) whom we are required to see to transition in any way, don't have any first hand experience of what being trans is like, and many just resort to following the 'trapped in the wrong body' thing. so if a trans person comes through their office and doesn't conform to this archetype, no hormones for them.

Basically 'trapped in the wrong body' is a shorthand for actual gender dysphoria, which is complex, and for a variety of reasons ranging from a lack of experience or a lack of motivation to understand, this is all most cis people will accept from us as an explanation"

* I could finally know about what constitutes my ""league"".
* I would have a friend who shares all my interest - we could pass the time together in things I usually do alone.
* I'm pretty reliable as a worker, so if she hung around for a bit I would get female-me a job at the same company. We'd make a heck of a team, we would. I bet I could get her on my lease as a family member too, maybe save on rent.

Clothing is a nice way to make it so that you don't see everyone's everything all the time.  In appropriate conditions it can be removed to reveal whatever the wearer wants to show.

Likewise, pleasant facial expressions and a pleasant tone of voice are the clothing of emotion.

Well, correct me if i'm wrong (not American and have never visited) education in the US is defined on state and local level (at best; is home schooling defined at all?), each state (at least) has their own program with whatever they decide. Even if there might be advantages in flexibility (schools in California can include classes on droughts; Kansas on tornados; Alabama on incest), it can lead to horrible gaps (sex ed for instance, or evolution) because a state's legislators don't agree.

11235,"I work in construction, to preface this. Generally construction workers are pretty low on moral totem pole, and are usually racist, sexist, pretty much all the -ists they have. 

On my current jobsite, we have a transgender, which, for my Union, is a first. (Openly trans I should say, we may have had prior, but unknown)

To the credit of this jobsite, of the hundreds of portapotties, none of them had anything about this girl. 

Sure, there was chatter, but never anything /mean/, just stupid jokes and overall curiosity. And she took it all in stride, knowing what she was going to have to face in the construction trade and being who she was. (mind you, prior to surgery, they were in construction, so they knew how ""we"" are)

I'm not an advocate for the LGBT community, I'm on the side of ""leave everyone alone and let them live their lives"" kinda thing, I am also not one to lose my shit, especially at work.

Until the safety guy, of all people, started talking about ""it"". I overheard a conversation, and not really paying attention, I heard him say ""it"" over and over again, using air quotes. I pieced together the fact that he was talking about her. I butted in and corrected him, saying ""(name) a she, not an it"" and he corrected me by saying ""it"" again, along with ""he-she"" and such. I mentioned that ""she"" was our ""sister"" (we are Union) and that if her paperwork gets sent to the house with the heading ""Dear Sister"" then she is our sister. (I had clarified this with her months ago, she asked the Union to change the heading from"" ""Dear brother"" to which they did.)

A few bickers back and forth, and I started walking away until I overheard him continue his conversation with the other guys and said ""one day I was trying to eat lunch and it was putting on make up, lost my appetite and threw my food away"". 

So, in a maddening flourish, I threw my hardhat on the ground, winged my walkie talkie onto the table, got my keys and said ""Fuck this place, I'm out"".



Really pissed me off that he made us all sign a sexual harassment policy update the day prior. Granted, he never directed any of this AT her, I was still just seeing red the whole time."

He was so confused and my mom, who had no idea about any of this was distraught. I told him I was laughing because my sister's memory is better than mine and i don't remember any of that.
He asked in confusion ""she remembers?"".
The rest of the convo was a mix of me asking him questions like ""are you going to molest your baby once they are born?"" (his wife was expecting) and berating him for being a shit human being.

This happened 2 years ago. It left me extremely fucked up because I seem to be the only person the family worried that he is going to do it again, (and that he is probably still doing it), considering he is a teacher.
A week ago I decided to tell some family members of mine who have young children (haven't done it yet), but I still don't know if this is the correct decision as I truly wish I had never known this. Nothing good has come from knowing this.

On one hand I could possibly be protecting my other little cousins, on the other I could be making life so much harder for everyone because they would have to live with this knowledge and fear for the rest of their lives, as I am."

I don’t consider it faking and if they ask me outright I will be honest with them, I just see it as bending the truth for their benefit. I don’t do this for men who are nowhere near on target, if that is the case i will try and gently guide and instruct them on how to get me where I need to be, but if everything is perfect but I just can’t finish because of my dumb brain I will go through the motions as though I climaxed to save their feelings because every other time I would have had multiple orgasms.

This does *not* mean we can travel between the spaces of stars on *our* live times, just that we can get some people from one star system to the other. Does not involve, in anyway, FTL travel.

Filter 4: FTL (?) If this filter exists, and if it can be broken, the species which does this becomes inter-galactic, and is impossible to remove from the Universe.

11267,"I did a timeshare presentation once with my girlfriend. We sat and had free drinks and waffled for a little, trying to get the sales lady to waste some time. Eventually, she asked us straight up what we did for a living.

I played a 'stay-at-home-dad' for our pet dog, Lucy.

My 'fiance' played assistant store manager for Subway, with annual income of $22k.

We acted extremely enthused about the timeshare, so the now extremely dubious-looking rep went ahead for awhile. We cooed excitedly for about 5 minutes before my friend brought up the fact that our credit had been ruined a year back after we had our new jeep repossessed.

The presenter was at a loss, so she brought in her manager. This guy was hella suave. Blue suit, diamond earring, gorgeous hair and skin. He was all smiles with his brilliant white teeth. We ran him through the same routine and that smile quickly morphed into a frown. He got a little testy.

""*How are you even in Mexico if you have no credit and only make 22k a year!?*""

My 'fiance,' who had been basically running the show, paused and gave me a coy look.

""Well, Licenseless_Rider here...""

""I won $3000 in a scratch off!""

Flash forward to this February (just before I turned 28): I get a neuropsych diagnosis: ADHD, SPD, subclinical OCD, and dysgraphia. (The OCD is only subclinical because I've spent years pruning the negative compulsions with self-directed CBT only leaving compulsions that are mostly helpful.) The autism cannot be officially diagnosed (yet) because it requires testing that I can't afford, however, 2 psychiatrists, multiple therapists, and multiple people I work with (coworker-types) who work with special needs have said ""you're definitely autistic."" Both psychs said it with the adendum ""but I cannot diagnose you officially."" (If you didn't know: the ""classic"" autistic person has ADHD, SPD, dyslexia/dysgraphia, and OCD plus social comprehension/processing issues.) 

Self diagnosed by 9, didn't get confirmation until nearly 20 years later."

11287,"Bear with me, I’m not in a medical field, so my wording may not be 100% accurate, but the feelings sure were. 

I was getting a procedure for supraventricular tachycardia, where the doctor burns out an extra pathway (congenital bonus feature) in the AV node. In order to start this, the EP (electrophysiologist) has to induce tachycardia artificially and map how the heart reacts during this malfunction, so they basically know which pathway is dominant and which is “misbehaving.”

He’s in there electronically stimulating my heart into tachycardia, which is agonizing. Tachycardia feels exactly like a heart attack, because there isn’t enough blood flow in the heart, the same thing that happens in a heart attack (though it isn’t deadly).  The signal to beat is being sent double time, and the heart doesn’t have time to fill all the way before pumping again. 

Adenosine kicks hearts stuck in supraventricular tachycardia out of the loop. In order to get more data on where to burn, they administered it to me about two hours into this.  The nurse came to my head and told me it would be very uncomfortable, but short. 

It felt like a truck slammed into me, and I felt like I was dying. I rationally knew I wasn’t dying, because I could see my heart on the monitors, but holy shit I thought I was. My heart itself hurt so badly, and it went from pounding out of my chest (the monitors reading up to 230-250 beats per minute, which I would get to during tachycardia as I went about my life, thus the procedure) to slamming into a normal beat cadence.  

But the pressure, the great feeling of weight, and the darkness was all-consuming. It lasted all eternity. I thought I was exploding. I thought I was imploding. I felt like I couldn’t inhale. And worse, I was aware, I was awake, I could see the monitors and my heart beating, and the room moving as normal, like being trapped in a waking nightmare.

I don’t know if she was wrong about “short,” or if time slowed to grant me a particularly sharp memory of this pain. I was acutely aware of the fact that the EP told me not to breathe deeply, or it would move the sensors and the ablation device (burning mechanism), and I may end up with a pacemaker. (I’m a pro athlete, and it was not eight months before the Olympic Games).  That was the only thing, the ONLY thing, that kept me from screaming right there on the table. 

He started burning my aberrant pathway not long after this, which hurt even more than the tachycardia. I never even imagined I could and would live to feel my heart being actively burned for HOURS. Twice more they administered adenosine, interlaced with burning.  At some point I think I started to actually cry, but silently, because to inhale sharply would be to move all those pieces inside my heart. 

Two months later, it was clear the procedure had been unsuccessful (I had not one extra, but TWO extra pathways), and I got to do it all again. I’m sure there are more agonizing things in life, but I haven’t experienced any. 

Tl;dr- OW! OW again. I don’t have a pacemaker, and my heart now beats like a normal person. "

11401,"I think that there wasn't a positive side to my parents' strictness.  [Mom did some things right](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/8eh5pg/how_my_mom_taught_me_to_self_advocate/) but she had this idea that parents need to be a united front, and went along with enforcing a lot of my dad's shit for a while.  And that wasn't good.  Because my dad is a SHIT parent.  So Mom ended up doing a lot of shitty things because of him.

The rules were not created with good intentions.  The rules were created either because Dad couldn't stand it when people felt strong emotions in front of him (like happiness.)  And because Dad wanted his kids to fit a specific image, whether or not that would ultimately make them happy.

For example, making me bike seven miles before I could see a friend on the weekends.  Dad made me do that because I quit gymnastics.  (I wasn't getting any better at it, and was actually getting worse as I got older and less flexible.  It was time.)  Dad wanted athletic children, and it PISSED him off that I refused to join an organized sport.  So he decided I had to bike seven miles, while he jogged next to me, every weekend before I could see a friend.  I wasn't fat.  My school had gym class 5 days a week.  I was reasnobly active as a child.  So there was no like, concern for my health behind that rule. It was *literally* just created because I wasn't the sort of child Dad wanted.

And the rule did not have a positive effect on me.  It didn't teach me to value exercise, or help me bond with my dad.  Instead, I learned that friends had to be *worth* the amount of time and energy it took my little 10 year old, very prone to heat stroke, body to bike 7 miles in the summer with no shade.  And it was better to be alone than to go through all that trouble for somebody who wasn't worth it.

By the 5th grade I wouldn't play with anybody but my absolute best friend, and didn't really make any more friends until high school.  This made me a prime target for bullies, and got the school on my back about being ""anti social"" which lead to some really traumatic experiences in high school, that then interfered with me actually getting *very necessary* help in college after I had a nervous breakdown.  (Which actually was directly caused by my father too!)

.

So um, to answer your question, I feel very poorly about how I was raised in the big picture.  I did not come to appreciate the rules I felt were petty and unreasonable as a child.  (Actually, as an adult I ended up resenting some of the rules child-me thought were reasonable because after growing up I realized how fucked up they were.)  I don't think they imparted may good qualities, unless you consider the ability to convincingly lie and leverage my ""goodie two shoes"" rep to my advantage, good qualities.

I have an okay relationship with my parents now.  Mostly because they're coming around to the fact that they were wrong.  And also because as an adult, they don't really have any legal authority to enforce stupid bullshit anymore."

11411,"If you ever try acid, do not (under any circumstances) take anything else with it. No alcohol, no weed, no nothing. Have a Xanax on hand in case it starts to go pretty sour and you need to calm down, but that’s it. 

Have someone you trust who has done acid before trip-sit you. You’ll want them to be able to take you to the park or something (you’ll want to explore). Make sure you have nothing to worry about. Like no homework due soon or a big presentation coming up. No work that day. And make sure you don’t have to be up early the next day because acid will keep you up. 

If you’re afraid of getting caught and being in trouble (like roommates or
Family) hold off on doing the acid until you’re in a place where that’s not a problem. It will sour your trip. 

And do not—under any circumstances—take more than 150ug for your first few times. I’d say 150 might even be too much, but that depends on you. 

Test your acid before you use it. Get a test kit online so you can make sure it isn’t a research chemical that will fuck you up. If you put it on your tongue and it’s bitter, spit it out. It’s not acid. You’ll get fucked. 

Turn off your phone before you do it. Don’t want work calling or your parents calling or something. Tell everyone who might need to contact you that you’ll be shutting off your phone to study/work/whatever. You also don’t want to make stupid Snapchat videos because everyone will know you’re on something but they won’t know what. 

Be careful out in public. Rely on trip sitter to help and guide you. Listen to what they say. "

Do I just put a fake smile on my face and pretend to the outside world that I'm happy? Sometimes I try that, but it really makes me sad because I have to pretend and can't genuinely be.

Deep Space 9 has aged the best. Still incredibly relevant. It's the darkest of the older series, and the most serialized. It's commentary on authoritarianism is timeless, and the character development is excellent. 

The Next Generation has the best single episodes and is the most hopeful and moralistic of the series.  It shows the best of humanity, and is a commentary on what we can become without war, hatred and money. Start with season 2, though, season one was bad. 

Voyager... Is okay... I wouldn't discount it entirely, but I'd never recommend it for a first time viewer.

The Original Series is campy and fun, very much a show out of the 60s. It's morality plays discussing issues of that era only it's set in space. Production values were low, and there's a lot of overacting, but it holds up way better than most television of that era.

When confronted, this absolute scholar of a child came up with a brilliant decision. Admit wrongdoing and hope for leniency? Nope.

They also had mini-golf. For returning your ball you got 2 tokens back. The golf was included and unlimited with the wristband.

We'd play super fast and get our $0.50 of video games. Then we started fishing them out of the water hazards.

At my peak during the summer I'd get dropped off in the morning. Pay for the wrist band myself and clear an easy $40. I was able to sell the tokens 5 per dollar to other patrons.

-Stannis, ADWD.

&gt; It may be that we shall lose this battle... In Braavos you may hear that I am dead. It may even be true. You shall find my sellswords nonetheless...you will avenge my death, and seat my daughter on the Iron Throne. Or die in the attempt.

-Stannis, TWOW, uttered before he goes against the Boltons...he's willing to die before killing Shireen to win against the Boltons


How book Stannis diverges from this is beyond me... Either DnD were faithful to GRRM's end game and GRRM has a lot of plot making to make this character progression natural, or DnD are embellishing Shireen's fate by assigning Stannis as the direct cause.

I'm not upset Shireen died. Her death was pretty much inevitable. But under Stannis's command for victory against the Boltons, I doubt.


TWOW quote had him half expecting his death and setting up an advanced directive to seat Shireen on the throne in such an event, meaning he's willing to die rather than sacrifice Shireen. Why would he suddenly change his mind if he survives? Why not guarantee his victory from the get go, prevent his men dwindling, and sacrifice her right away? It's inconsistent. Not to mention, she's left behind at Castle Black.

I would've rather they killed Stannis then, than bastardize his character worse than ever. They already made it so that it was Mel's word that he went North, not Davos'; they also cut one of his best lines

&gt;I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne

a realization he attributes to Davos, not Mel; I don't even want to mention D&amp;D making him a fanatic either, burning his people for mere heresy [Shireen's uncle wasn't burned in the books for believing in the Seven, but for making a deal with the Lannisters to marry off Shireen to Tommen]. 

I knew something was up when they were suddenly giving him likeable scenes only in the beginning of the season prior to the burning. His character change was worse than Barristan's death for me.

Shireen's sacrifice was expected, but not with Stannis's permission. My prediction is Stannis dies and Mel burns Shireen back at Castle Black to resurrect Stannis but instead resurrects Jon. The only way I see Stannis giving permission to burn Shireen is to save the realm from the Others, the White Walkers, not to win against humans."

Giving credit to the writers for showing what truly suicidal people often do, she appears to have come to terms with everything and be happy and at peace, but this is only because she has chosen her end - that is very often how people actually behave once they plan their suicide, and carry it out.

I find no correlation between the money guys spend on their tools and their skill as a mechanic. Personally, I have Snap On, Mac, Proto, Knipex, GearWrench, and a lot of Craftsman.  I choose Made in America whenever possible, but there are no hard and fast rules about which tools you need.  I do find I gravitate to nicer tools, as struggling with tools while fixing an airplane outside in a snowstorm in butthole Alaska is an awful experience.

I think for most people, unless you KNOW you're going to use the tool a lot, buy cheap and buy the best if it breaks is a good rule.

And as long as you are able to verify its authenticity, you can find great deals on Ebay.  I found my Knipex pliers for almost 50% off retail; full inch pattern Craftsman 12 point socket sets for $40, Snap On rachets and their old soft grip screwdrivers for 30% off.

WWE do have a 'developmental' show called NXT, and that's where you'll see where the company really shines. Well-realised, interesting characters that have logical, easy-to-follow storylines that grip you from the beginning. Not to mention some of the greatest wrestlers in North America.

The bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima literally leveled cities, melted the exposed skin off of people's bones, and killed many thousands of people.  Individually, they could do in seconds what entire bomb wings took days/weeks to do with conventional weapons.  

When most people think of the risks associated with nuclear weapons, they think of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but modern nuclear weapons are *orders of magnitude* larger.  

Think of how destructive World War 2 was.  Now imagine that the damage of every bullet, every shell, every grenade, every mortar, and every bomb, and combine them.  Imagine all of the pictures of all of the destroyed buildings in places like London, Berlin, Warsaw, Belgium, Japan, etc.  Now pack all of that devastation into a single weapon... that's approaching the level of energy for a thermonuclear bomb.

He looks at me and kinda awkwardly says ""I robbed one of the smoke shops for a hazing..."" And his mom quickly pipes in with ""It was just stupid boy stuff!""

Can not reiterate enough, this seems like a good kid. I really just think he needs some guidance, and to be kept away from the gangs. But I also think he should be held accountable for actions, because he won't learn otherwise if something so major is shrugged off as ""boys will be boys."" "

  That's probably part of the 'face saving' and 'work ethic 'culture you see in a lot of Asian countries.  They may or not may actually be enthusiastic about work, but they darn well will act like it.  In Japan in particular, people work extra hard because a lot of companies even take care of their employees and treat them with value, unlike in the West, so there's a very strong drive to be a productive citizen in that regard.  Japanese companies are often considered 'jobs for life' because the incentive to be loyal is good benefits wise, that this why people work so hard for them.  Even sleeping on the job is considered acceptable (in some places) as a sign that you are working hard.  There's a lot of social pressure there - i.e. employees are even expected to hang out together after work, etc.; some like it because it gives them structure and an impetus to succeed, while others don't and burn out, I'm sure. 

As far as the calisthenics in the park, I wonder if that's similar to the early-morning Tai Chi Chuan you see with older citizens in China."

It was her parents property and she was living there while going to college. We all drank wine and laughed. That night we had a mild threesome- the highlight being each of us boob-sucking at the same time. 



We drifted apart and lived in different cities. I didn’t see him a whole bunch for 7 or 8 years. He could never quite figure life out and suffered from personal demons. At 33 he put a gun in his mouth and died. We grew up in a remote town- 30 people flew home to celebrate his life. He was truly beloved by so many and had made so many people happy.

For example, our approach checklist has ""Lighting"" on it. Normally, that's a skip step because we turn the lights on before takeoff and leave them on until after landing.

Despite this burdening debt, she always did her best to give myself and my brother opportunities that she didn't have growing up in a small town.

Like the Avengers every wrestler has their own super power, but in wrestling their called ""Finishing Moves"".  So like how super heroes are looking for openings to best use their powers against villains a good chunk of in ring story telling is wrestlers looking for openings to use their finishers.

I'll fully admit that wrestling isn't always good but when its good, its really good.

11938,"I loved the book, but did not love the film with Jeremy irons at all. They made small changes to the plot that add up to making HH far more sympathetic, so that the film could almost be said to be the story of a  romance between a middle aged man and a 14 year old girl-which is at worst dangerous if it emboldens actual pedophiles. In fact it's barely an exaggeration to say that in the film *she* seduces *him* (''she seduced me, officer!'').     
  
 The film leaves out the following    
  
-that when he was in college he was seriously considering raping his friend's younger sister before killing himself    
 -that his favourite hobby before meeting lo was to sit on park benches getting turned on by children playing      
-that he'd been in mental institutions twice     
-that he was lying when he told Lolita she was his first (he'd been with dozens of prostitutes, and married twice)     
-his plan to impregnate her so that he can molest and impregnate their daughter, and then molest her daughter too, so that he'd have substitutes for her once she hit puberty and therefore stopped being attractive to him.  Seriously.   

-that his original plan had been to drug her and rape her while she slept, and the only reason he didn't was because the sleeping pills weren't strong enough. *That's* why he was testing the sleeping pills on her mother, not to avoid sex with her mother as in the film (where it's played for laughs).   
 
-that he'd been planning to murder her mother in order to get her to himself, and only changed his mind at the last second       
  

-the part where he pays her small change to jerk him off while they sit in a classroom at her detention, and he focuses on one of her schoolmates sitting in front of them
   
 while these are mostly minor changes individually, the overall effect is to make him less of a monster, and almost a *victim* of her seduction. Perhaps this was done to try and make it less disgusting, and if so that was a mistake-it just makes it pedophile wish fulfilment. Also, some of the scenes verge on softcore child porn

11971,"I was driving to a job one morning last month when I felt the terrible stomach tremors that herald an explosive shite of epic proportions. It wasn’t helped by the very spicy chicken panang curry I had the night before. Or by the new 10 strength Nespresso capsules that my wife changed us to. 
I was driving on the motorway &amp; near my exit, so I thought I could make it to a petrol station to use the toilet. I pulled over &amp; went in. Turns out they didn’t have a toilet! Oh fuck! With sweat pouring down my face, I set the satnav for the next closest petrol station. 10 mins away. “I can make it!”
Get to the next station. No loo. Now I’m struggling to stand up straight. I’m sweating &amp; the stomach convulsions are getting bad. A small fart creeps out &amp; I feel the beast at the back door. The smell is horrendous. I get back in the van &amp; head to the high street. Perhaps there is a cafe open that has a toilet? 
I only get 2 mins down the road. It’s too late. I have to go now! It’s a busy street. I pull over and grab a handful of old McDonalds napkins from the glove box. Jump out &amp; open the back of the van. I get in with my fistful of paper napkins &amp; fashion a potty out of aluminium foil we have in there. Pull my shorts down &amp; crash one out. It’s like releasing a flock of doves at a wedding. Brown stinky spicy hot ring stinging doves. The relief is instantaneous but short lived. The van now smells like a Mumbai sewage plant.  
Wrap up my stinky bundle of nightmares &amp; chuck it in a bin.  I leave the van doors open for a few mins to air it out before heading to the job. People walk past wretching at the smell &amp; giving me the evil eye but it was worth it. I am 37 years old &amp; have successfully managed to make it to 8am without shitting myself. Victory!

Now, i'm not one of those people that like ""man, music today sucks. classic rock or GTFO"" either. I happen to love a lot of current music, there's some really great shit happening out there. but I'd say overall we're not in a ""golden age"" for music. music in today's culture is so niche and bifurcated. Sure it might be a great time to be a fan of [insert obscure subgenre ""X"" here] but in the 60s, popular music as a whole was a linchpin connecting you with everyone else around you in a way that it just isn't these days. It was truly a ""golden era"" that produced music that completely saturated the entire culture and has remained almost as relevant (and listenable) today as it was back then. And that's just the 60's. Music in general has gone through many ""golden eras"" over the past 600 years or so. 

I'm not sure if we'll ever have another musical ""golden era"" either, as many people just don't care about music the same way that they used to. There are so many other entertainment options out there to suck up people's attentions (TV is in way more of a golden era today than music, for example), not to mention I think ""technology"" might be a bigger cultural linchpin than music will ever be again. Our technology binds us together now (and also makes us more alone than ever...kind of odd paradox). Technology kingpins like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are the household names now, whereas we have fewer and fewer real larger than life ""rock stars"" anymore.  "

12005,"I’m glad you posted. Well for you, or anyone else interested, I’d recommend watching shows or playing games with non-straight characters. It’s sometimes easier to start with fictional characters. They aren’t real, so you can’t hurt their feelings, and it can be easier to sympathize with them at first. And to clarify, I don’t mean shows like Queer as Folk or shows that are just about queer relationships. While those can be great, they might be a bit much for those just starting their journey of acceptance. I mean shows like Brooklyn 99 with Holt and Rosa. Steven Universe is a great one. It’s mostly for kids, but adults can appreciate it too. Bioware games have great characters like Cortez from ME3 or Krem from Inquisition. 

Once again, thank you for posting that question. While it would be nice for everyone to accept the lgbtq+ community unconditionally, I understand that, for some, acceptance is a journey and a hard one at that. Good luck out there.

12062,"I had a dream where I was seeing everything in first person and I was walking barefoot through the woods. The crazy part was I was holding somebody’s legs as if it were a piggy back ride and I remember seeing myself being coated in oatmeal. I woke up from this dream thinking that it was the most real feeling dream I had ever had (still is to this day almost 15 years later) but I was very confused as to why I would be coated in oatmeal.

Flash forward about 6 months I was at a summer camp and our camp was divided into multiple teams for the week for a giant competition. On one of the last nights hey had an event called fight night. I participated in one specific event where I had to pick up and remove as many deli pickles from a kiddie pool filled with oatmeal using only my elbows. At this point I still did not recognize that real events were in fact leading up to what had transpired in my dream. After the event everyone was sent to the lake to wash off. 

So there I was walking through the woods on a trail covered in oatmeal, still oblivious to this being my dream from 6 months prior. Suddenly one of the camp mates from my team comes running up and jumps on my back complaining that the ground was hurting her bare feet. And at that moment I looked down at my feet and everything in my brain started freaking out. 

Realizing this was the exact moment from my dream I dropped my friend who was understandably mad and confused. I tried explaining everything to everyone and no one believed me.

It was honestly one of the creepiest feelings I had ever had in my entire life."

12093,"Thank you, that's very kind of you to say. I wouldn't say that I sympathize with their choices necessarily, but I'm always fascinated by WHY people do the things they do. It's my main motivator in life, to find out WHY. I believe that no deed has ever been done that wasn't justified in the mind of the doer. What set of circumstances, what personality traits, what rationalizations, had to happen for this human being in front of me to think that that course of action, in that moment, was justified? Justification doesn't mean they think it was right, it means they thought the reward was worth the risk. If you dig, you find life stories full of abuse and neglect and abandonment and poverty. Most of my clients never had a fucking chance. Combine that with poor impulse control, which is something anybody can have no matter their background, and you get unmitigated disaster. I always want to know what was going through their head. I try my best to find out. Regardless of what they've done, they're still a person who wants all the same things that anybody else wants. There is no bright line between ""criminal"" and ""normal person."" They ARE normal people, they just couldn't or wouldn't control their impulses in that moment because the reward seemed higher than the risk. Really, nobody's invulnerable to a bad risk-reward calculation now and then."

She also said I might need to carry pepper spray or something for self defense.   

I did stop going on my morning walks because it really freaked my grandma out but I kinda brushed it off. 

I was at a reptile expo about two weeks later.   Walking up and down the isles, just looking at the snakes while my dad was in the bathroom.   His stomach was upset that day so he took awhile.     A breeder let me hold this gorgeous ball python and suddenly I felt breath on my neck and smelt the stench of stale piss.   I kinda froze and stared ahead of me.   The snake breeder was talking to people...  I couldn't really move since my only exit was to my back left and somebody was pressing up against me... He was like smelling me and breathing on me.  I had no idea what to do in that situation.   Suddenly a woman shoved herself between me and this guy aggressively and he left.    She told me that creep was following me so she stuck around protectively to make sure I was okay out of mom instincts.  She told me that  I really need to watch my surroundings and consider carrying pepper spray....   It was nuts.  The exact same thing the old woman at the grocery store had said.   My dad found me and we bought the snake.   I told him what happened and he had me find the woman so he could thank her.   "

12216,"It was last night.

Husband and I are out of town for the weekend and our 3 year old son stayed with my mom and stepdad. They spent the day yesterday on their friend's boat. I called my mom late in the evening to check in on the kiddo and they were in the car. All the sudden she started screaming and wasn't responding to me and I could hear my son crying. Then I couldn't hear an adult anymore and could only hear my kid crying by himself. Then the call dropped.

I kept calling back and she finally answered. Turns out some guy cut them off and got out of his car, so my stepdad decides the best course of action is to get out and fight the guy with my child in the back seat. My mom also got out of the car to split them up, leaving my son crying alone in the car that still has the keys in the ignition. 

I lost my fucking mind. I started screaming at them and asking what the fuck is wrong with them and why did they not just drive away? She kept saying ""We didn't do anything to that guy and he got out of his car and started coming at us!"" So I'm like I don't give a fuck what the other guy was doing, you have my son in the car and you should drive the fuck off. My stepdad was also slurring his words and I said he was clearly buzzed and I could not believe that he was driving. My mom kept trying to say that he was fine, and I'm calling bullshit.

They both then had the gall to act like I'm in the wrong and be like ""How dare you talk to us like that when we're helping you out and watching him,"" Fuck you. You put him in danger.

So now we're coming home early because they're pieces of irresponsible shit."

He drilled in our heads that a lawyer's job, especially in criminal law, is not to get the conviction/acquittal, it's to find justice. It's cliche and idealistic, but it's also true. 

On a couple occasions, most recently this Friday, I had to deal with an investigator who refused to listen to reason. I knew we had a terribly weak argument to make (this was a post-conviction motion - guy was guilty but can't really get into specifics). I also knew the defense attorney has 44 years experience and is one of the best at cross examining I've ever seen. I told the investigator we're going to lose, tried to work out a deal (I wouldn't have made one either if I were defense). Day of the hearing I actually found case law that eviscerated my already weak argument. I told the investigator, he didn't care. I discussed with my supervisor and our solution was just to put the investigator on the stand, let him make his pitch, then let the defense attorney teach him the lesson I tried. It was the most brutal cross examination I've ever seen in person. I'm actually glad I got to watch it, it was perfect. I believe the investigator learned his lesson. "

But anyway the pain was unbearable (I thought I was dying, plus I was 8 so I didn’t even know what an appendix was) but there was a point before I got it removed where it actually got better, I think that was probably when it burst.

12303,"Not OP, but I have something very similar, so can try to explain...

I went through a similar experience, thinking I had a UTI, that just wouldn't go away. Ended up having a cystoscopy (where they shove a camera up your dick, which is about as pleasant as it sounds), so they could ""inflate"" my bladder and see what they could find...which was nothing much. In the days/weeks after that, after a whole heap of googling myself of the symptoms, I stumbled across ""Toilet Disorder"", which is a form of anxiety/panic disorder. Immediately realized that's what I had, and got myself referred for CBT to try and get it sorted.

Basically, in various social situations, my brain basically doesn't work right, and triggers messages telling me my bladder is at max capacity and I need to piss *right fucking now* (hence why the initial thought was that I had a UTI).

So it's not that anxiety makes it hurt to piss directly...it's that when it's bad, the anxiety causes you to go into full ""hold it in"" mode (like on those occasions when you go way too long without peeing and are genuinely afraid you're going to piss yourself) way too often, and if there is a toilet around, you end up making trips there every few minutes, just to squeeze out a few drops. I'm sure you can appreciate that after a while, it starts to really hurt. Imagine trying to piss somewhere in the region of 80 times a day, and doing stomach crunches between each visit. It's one of those things that probably sounds hilarious to someone that hasn't experienced it, and I can sort of laugh about it myself as it just sounds so ridiculous, but trust me, it *really* fucking sucks, to the point where, at my worst state, I was seriously considering requesting my bladder be removed and replaced with a colostomy bag etc, or even killing myself.

Psychotherapy (CBT) and anti-anxiety drugs (beta blockers) didn't really do enough to ""cure"" me, but thankfully I've been able to control it much better over the years (it's been about 8 or 9 now, I think). I still have situations where it triggers the panic (any scenario where it's either socially unacceptable to get up and go for a piss, like in the middle of an important meeting or work presentation, or where it's forbidden to use a toilet - the first and last 20 minutes of any flight are like my own personal hell), but most of them I'm able to plan for in some way, to ensure I can get through it without having a full on panic attack."

The math course covered a large variety of stats topics, along with other important life math subjects, like calculating mortgage amortization or 401k returns.  He said it helped disavow some kids of the notion that saving $20/month would be enough for them to retire on in 45 years."

The cashier was having a great conversation with the customer in front of me. Then it was my turn. She rang up my bottle of water, muttered how much it cost, didn't make eye contact with me, and dropped my change on the counter instead of handing it to me. She didn't even say bye or for me to have a good day.

12357,Yeah. He seems like he has a drinking problem. 
12358,"His history doesn't make him ""not an arrogant"" though. When i read your comments i thought you're going to explain his attitude early in his career. A broke guy doesn't mean a humble guy, just saying."
12359,"One thing that really made me choose a side was the video she released. The way she kept egging him on reminded me so much of someone I know. She wasn’t trying to calm the situation. You can’t argue with a drunk. Just go away and leave them be and we never see how the whole thing started. She was narrating the scene for the camera.

There is no denying it, he’s a drunk and probably a drug addict - something he struggled with his whole life. 

When he was with Vanessa Paradis, he was on track and then the whole Rum Diaries affair happened. Paradise recorded a song for her ‘Love Songs’ album, it’s called “The Dark It Comes”. I have to admit that she said the song wasn’t about her and Johnny BUT it’s just such a big coincidence in my opinion... when you hear/read the lyrics you’ll see what I mean. I think Amber broke him. 

Remember the cringeworthy apology he had to record because she smuggled her dogs into Australia? 😖

"
12360,"Not just him - she's killing other people. An unvaccinated child can become a vector for disease, and then expose vulnerable people, such as very young infants, elderly people, and people with compromised immune systems.

12367,"Honestly, my wife. She is my second wife, stepmom to my daughter (my daughter's mom and I split a few years before her suicide.) I think that without her I would have drank myself to death within a year of my daughter's death. As it is I drink more than I should (and more than I did before her death,) but I keep it in check. I'm also on anti depression medication now, and have a psychologist that I see on an as-needed basis (only when I feel the need to talk.)   

  

I also belong to a group for parents that have lost children, not specifically to suicide but to all manor of deaths. Next to my wife it's those guys that have helped me get through. We have a group of about 12 guys now that have become friends outside of that group and we get together once a month for beer and wings. We have a great time, sometimes it gets a little sad but mostly just a bunch of guys having a good time. We are all comfortable there because we've all been through the same thing. It's hard sometimes to have a good time with other people, as you feel (at least I do) that I shouldn't be enjoying myself, it'll look bad. Stupid I know. With these guys, we can just be ourselves."

On one hand, I want a house because I don't want to keep renting. I want to be able to decorate it how I like, change things I don't like, etc. Houses are expensive, but I've budgeted and saved, so i'm ready to pounce when I see one come up.

But on the other hand, i've wanted a horse for years. I absolutely adore riding. And they are like giant dogs with great personalities. I'd like to be able to take it on trails or to a lake and go swimming and to be able to ride with friends who also own a horse. Buying the horse is the easy part - hell I could get a super nice horse with that down payment money I have saved up. And the money I have budgeted to be future mortgage payments, that should cover feed and board and other horsey costs. But then I don't get a house. 

And no, I can't find a cheaper house, because i'm struggling as is to find a house within my budget :|

Not in a truly ill way, but just being very tired. I remember putting my head down on my desk out of exhaustion and the next thing I can remember is waking up the next morning for school. So in order for this to have happened, I would have had to have slept 15 consecutive hours, which I'm sure would've alarmed my parents, but they did not act like anything was out of the ordinary the next day when I woke up for preschool.

I was a hardcore drug addict for years and did more drugs than I could ever hope of counting. I've seen people have horrible hallucinogenic drug trips, and have experienced some myself.

I find it highly baffling that anyone who has done hallucinogenics would be doubtful of someone stripping their clothes while on hallucinogenics. I vividly remember being on shrooms and finding my pants/underwear extremely uncomfortable, but I kept them on. I was on a fairly low dose of shrooms though.  I have no doubt that someone who took a ton of shrooms, especially if it was their first time, rationalized a reason to take their clothes off. It can be a very confusing experience, especially for first timers or people who take too many. Also eating shrooms in high school is not exactly a calming place to do it."

I also a little bit subscribed to the theory that the show made her a little worse than she probably was because it was told through the eyes of Marshalls best friend, but the way they made Lily a part of the journey with Marshall and didn't just show him in it alone was the story arch that made me think they were meant to be together."

Everyone knew that On The Beach was going to be Anthony Edwards's last appearance on the show, so the producers had to shock us to make us feel the emotions about his death.  That's why they had Dr. Carter read his letter at the end of the previous episode.  For those of us who were watching at the time, the news of his death came a week earlier than we were expecting, and it was like a sucker punch to the gut."

I looked at the spot half asleep and was like maybe if I put a towel down like when I sweat really badly that'll be ok, because I really hate sleeping on bare mattress. Did that, she came back in and I was like I just put a towel down I'll clean it in the morning as long as you dont mind the towel, so you dont have to feel the wet spot. She was like no and we got back into bed and she started crying again and I was like ""oh fuck I offended her because the towel didn't I"". So I told her I just did that because it's what I do when I sweat and the bed gets to wet. She started laughing and was like no, I was crying because last time this happened with someone they yelled and got upset, thank you. 

I was bewildered, like what the fuck, it's natural, why would someone get upset about that. She still brings it up as the moment she knew I was a good man and I still just wonder what the fuck is the matter with other dudes. Props on you for being another cool dude about it, man."

12505,"I was waiting for the bus when I watched an accident happen.

Woman waiting at a light has her vehicle rammed into by anotner woman who was doing her makeup. 

The vehicle got hit was a large SUV and the vehicle that was hitting was a small sports car. 

So the hitting vehicle basically ran under the other vehicle. Which meant makeup lady got her face gashed up pretty bad by the bumper of the SUV. 

Like, there was a flap of skin hanging off. 

I've taken off my hoodie and am trying to staunch the blood and get her away from the possibly leaky vehicle when another voice starts coming from the car!! The woman had her kid in the car.

(I should note the occupants of the SUV were largely uninjured.)

12555,"TLDR; my super religious ex boyfriend wouldn’t have sex before marriage, but was a total horn dog. Thought that he could try to fuck me through his boxers and then prayed the guilt away when he couldn’t penetrate me. 

So it wasn’t QUITE penetration, but I can’t not share this story. So shamefully I dated a super religious, super emotionally and verbally abusive guy. He was horny constantly, and hated himself (sometimes to the point of self harm) every time he masturbated. Eventually once we saw each other more often, we’d start making out and we’d undress. He’d always later yell at me for tempting him and say that it’s not his fault but mine that he can’t control himself. 

Fast forward to the night he decides he can use a religious “loophole” and fuck me through his boxers. Yes that’s right, through his boxers, with no lube..nothing. I try to explain to him how this will 200% not work, but he was determined to try. I was right, it did not work, and he immediately began praying for forgiveness afterwards. That guy was a fuckin mess. "

12587,Not only that but a lot of the non comic readers got spoiled on Glenn's death due to the legitimate outrage after the season finale.

12621,There's a documentary on Netflix by Louis Theroux. It's a very good watch and the information about the inner workings comes from an ex executive of the organization. The Church paints him as being a disgruntled former Scientologist on a smear campaign but he sees himself as a person who did some pretty bad things (he fully owns up to the awful things he did and makes no effort to hide them) and wants to attempt to make it right by exposing them and their inner workings.

The reason lawyers don't bring it up to you is because they're used to it, not because they're scared of not knowing what you mean. This probably isn't working in your favor to be honest. If a lawyer comes across something like ""ensignification"" they're not going to think it's a term they haven't learned yet - they're going to think that you thought that you had to create a new term for that, which looks kind of stupid.

She could have just said ""enjoy it guys, it's not about the literal visuals but the act, the vibes given by perfomance on the stage"" rather than rewriting a character's apperance on the spot to fit the show and call out the majority of fandom like ""I wrote the books, so shut the fuck up"". The actress could have green skin, red eyes and blue hair, that's never problem, but the stance of JK Rowling was the bugging issue for me. She so tried to be the ""Super progressive hero"" of the day and stuck herself around the racial issues made the meaning of act lost."

It was a farm house at the very edge of our delivery area that had flood lights illuminating the property in the pitch black night. I walked up to the back door and was greeted by a mumbling man maybe in his mid 60’s. He motioned me to come in and there was about 5-6 men standing along the wall in a row staring at this tiny 20 inch TV across the room. They didn’t acknowledge me or look at me at all. The old man handed me some bills and a handful of coins. I didn’t even bother counting the coins, I just noped the fuck out of there as soon as he handed me the money for the food. "

I put up ads and all that and made something like $3000 over 8 years. Now that Windows XP has almost disappeared it's all dried up. I keep the page going even though it isn't profitable since I still get an email a few times a year.

12708,"I got pulled over at 6pm on my way to vacation and was accused of being intoxicated because “my pupils are dilated”. I just told the guy “oh yeah, I’m prescribed adderall. Even though it’s a low dose, it still messes with my pupils.” 


He pulls me out of the car and wants me to do breathalyzer and sobriety test. Being completely sober, I would normally comply. But something told me not to entertain this cop. He had a bit of a “power trip” vibe going on. 


So refused both sobriety tests. He tries to tell me I can’t do that and it’s immediate grounds for arrest. Somehow I broke out of my asocial shell and said right to his face “now Officer you wouldn’t be trying to trick me into taking a rigged sobriety test would you?” (I’ve heard sobriety tests are designed for failure so I took my shot). I followed with “I know my rights and I know I can refuse both of these tests. It is your job to prove I am guilty, not my job to prove I’m innocent. What I also know is that it’s 6pm which means there’s no judge. It also means you can’t get a warrant for a blood test for another 14 hours. Even if I *was* intoxicated, I wouldn’t be in 14 hours.” 


He just responds “you got a smart mouth. You willing to put your record on the line?” 


I said back “are *you* willing to bet your *career* that I’m not sober?” When he questioned what I meant, I said “I’m not intoxicated, and I’ve displayed no behaviors of intoxication. I am not slurring my words and I was not pulled over for swerving. And you clearly don’t smell alcohol as I’m 100% sober. So take me in if you want, but when that blood test comes up clean I’ll be coming back full force for your badge. My step moms brother is a high end attorney who can prove Harrassment in a heart beat. You’ll be paying for emotional trauma, therapy, lost wages, lost time, my attorney, etc. Your precinct will have no choice but to terminate you to avoid a hike in lawsuit insurance. So are you willing to bet your career that I’m intoxicated?” He was a bit flustered. Idk if he was new or if I caught him off guard. But he couldn’t really respond. 


In the end, I was let go with just a mild speeding ticket, which is why I was originally pulled over. And let’s be clear, I’m normally *never* this suave with officers. I clam up, my heart races, I stutter, my face flushes. But something came over me that morning. 


Well, when I returned from vacation, I spotted an article about a local officer. Less than 30 minutes after letting me go, he got into an accident that seriously injured the guy in the back (he arrested someone else for dui). Turns out, that guy was 100% clean and clear but “failed the sobriety test miserably”. Turns out, this cop had a habit of arresting people for DUI by administering a sobriety test that you just can’t pass. If they consent to sobriety test, he can arrest them guilt free while *hoping* something is in their system and he gets a score. If they don’t, he can face serious backlash as it’s hard to prove probably cause. 


So had I actually submitted to his sobriety test, I would have been arrested for DUI. And *I* would have been the one in the back seat getting seriously injured. My brain chose a fantastic moment to turn off my social retardation. "

* Disapproval of a character trait or hobby that they were aware you had before you got together.
* Contempt for other people's harmless interests and habits.
* Voicing criticism of your friends/family.
* Repeatedly making jokes that you've said that you didn't like and then calling you sensitive for it, but then getting upset when you make ONE joke about them.
* HIDING YOUR RELATIONSHIP!
* Acting embarrassed to be seen with you and/or introducing you to people as their ""friend"".
* Willing to go to great lengths to help their friends and family, but if you need comfort, it's suddenly too much effort.
* Labeling you (Gaslighting?). While it is good to have a partner who encourages you to grow and be better, it's a bad sign if they put labels on you that don't have merit. My ex called me controlling/immature/high-maintenance and accused me of having abandonment issues, and I apologized for them each time. But when I thought about them alone afterwards, I always--without fail--realize: *""... Nothing of what I did was actually controlling/immature/high-maintenance.""*

And some warning signs for you:

* A gut feeling that they're ""fake"" or that they're doing all those lovely acts because they think it's what people in relationships do, not because they actually want to do it.
* Feeling overwhelmed, esp. by love-bombing.
* Unease and/or tempering down your interests and hobbies because you don't want them to think you're immature/silly.
* Altering your behavior to be a better partner to them.
* Feeling like you have to put on an act/not be yourself to make them continue to like you.
* *FEELING LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM!*

They CANNOT do that without eating, so it doesn't work in a completely barren desert. Camels however can go for around two weeks without drinking nor eating anything. In cold weather, camels in fact can go on for 6 months without drinking any fresh water if they can regularly eat moisture containing food.
EDIT: Food with a decent amount of moisture in it like grazing grass. "

Gilmore didn't think that would be a very happy performance for the audience to just stare at a wall for half the concert. So they came up with a compromise. There would be small platforms built on the audience side of the Wall and little vignettes performed on the platforms, so the audience could still be engaged visually during the show. Then at the end, the whole Wall would come tumbling down. Well the construction of the Wall was essentially complete by the time Comfortably Numb would come along, and so they put a spot light behind the Wall, and Glimore stood on top of the wall with his shadow cast out across the audience as he ripped up this intense and evocative guitar solo. He said that was the pinnacle of his career as a musician."

As I was holding her hand, reassuring her that everything was ok, I looked down to see my wife's... everything. The layers of fat and skin and stuff the doctor was peeling back was particularly interesting. He pulled our daughter out, she hollered and made her 'everything works' fuss. Then the doctor started the post removal process of cleaning out the afterbirth and such, pulled out what I think was her uterus, flopped it up onto her belly and got the gunk out, sutures and staples and my wife was all back together. 

I was pretty fascinated by the whole process, but I can honestly say most people will never see their spouse get eviscerated and then closed back up. 

Afterward I was informed that, typically, the area being opened would be blocked from view. 

Everyone was fine, everything came out great. Wife is fine and baby is fine, but in the terrible twos. My wife had a picture perfect pregnancy until she got to about 30 weeks when she suddenly started having some serious issues, extreme swelling from the waist down, about a month in the hospital. They thought she may have had preeclampsia as well, but could never really figure it out. The day after she got to 34 weeks they decided it was time to pull her.

My educational background in pre-med and as an Economist helps me to actually know how to research. I would absolutely love to go toe to toe with someone that makes a blatantly idiotic statement like you just did and see who knows more about the scientific and biological facts and data regarding vaccination. Honestly, that would flipping make my day. 

This isn't a debate. The science is clear and overwhelming.  Vaccination saves lives and is one of the safest preventative treatments out there. There is not ""a lot of pros and a lot of cons on both sides."" Are there rare serious side affects and risks with vaccination? Of course. That is the case with absolutely every thing. However, the risks of vaccination versus not vaccinating is orders of magnitude times orders of magnitude over again apart. Hundreds of millions of lives have been saved and many more prevented from permanent disability since Edward Jenner started smallpox vaccinations in the late 1700s. 

There is not a ""debate."" The only debate is on the side of idiots suffering a serious case of Dunning-Kruger and charlatans taking advantage of said idiots. There is a scientific and medical consensus worldwide on this issue for a reason. Because decades upon decades of research and well over a hundred years of data worldwide overwhelmingly supports vaccination for the vast majority of the population. For you to suggest otherwise tells me that you are the one who is in fact ""hilariously misinformed.""

I started to try to research it for myself. There was an older woman I really looked up to, well educated, generally reasonable, balanced person who was anti vax, so I asked her for recommendations on medical journals and scholarly information that had influenced her opinions. Because of the person she was, I figured she wouldn't have an opinion that she didn't have facts to back up. 

She said she didn't really have any sources, but the effects of things like vaccinations, the drugs given women in childbirth and artificial sweeteners hadn't been studied enough so it was better to just avoid them.

Her response cemented my faith in vaccinations. Of all the anti vax people I knew, I really trusted her to not buy into groundless hysteria, but I was wrong.

Just knowing and being able to spread basic hygiene, medical knowledge, and scientific principles puts you ahead of humanity for long enough that your reputation will let you coast once your knowledge is overtaken.  Live as the god-emperor.

Then, by the time we hit present day, you're already on a colony ship headed towards another habitable world. We're an interstellar species.  No chance of being on the Earth when the Sun expands into a red giant or we're destroyed by a GRB or something; we know nothing hits us between now and 1000 BCE, you'll be gone by the time any future event has a chance.

Worried about the heat death of the universe?  A black hole will take care of that and your immortality for you.  Time and space reverse, all time and outcomes flow towards the singularity, and there's your reward for taking humanity into the future far earlier while avoiding some of the worst atrocities in the past.

Also, if you're still on the Earth forever, you wouldn't just float through space after the destruction of earth.  Assuming Earth doesn't fall into the Sun or get swallowed by it expanding past our orbit, it'll likely eventually get ejected by a stellar crossing or some other massive body (such as OP's mother) making a close pass.  In which case you will live forever on a cold rock, and have plenty of time to work out the math on proton decay, because if you failed to get humanity into a golden age of science and space exploration, we probably didn't solve that one either, but you'll have at least 10^31 years to figure it out; after that, experimental observation will suffice.  Though maybe quantum tunneling will have turned you into iron by then."

I think the best bet, if you want to be around traditional civilizations (and make no mistake, there are many other perfectly valid paths you could follow), is to go to China, hang out there for a while, head to India when the Mauyra Dynasty gets going, and then migrate up through Persia to Greece and Rome once they're established.

Be more fit, eat nutritious foods, more enviromentally friendly; it all trends to fit into the same mindset. Sure it's a shit ton more work but some people enjoy that kind of lifestyle.

Personally I think the money thing is stupid as fuck. But to explain it a bit they're spending more for 'higher quality' products. If you were buying an apple and there's a nice shiny tasty looking one and a kinda old looking one with a huge bruise on the side... Maybe you'd pay more for the higher quality apple. For pure living you just have to think of the nasty apple as a regular apple and the tasty apple as an organic one. "

12998,THIS might be the dumbest post I've seen in my entire life.
12999,"Private pilot. I was 19, had just gotten my license and was doing one of my first trips with passengers - a 90 minute flight from Vancouver to Tofino (a popular surfing spot) over water and land, in a Cessna 172. With me was my girlfriend, my sister and her boyfriend. We were going to go surfing for the day and return that evening. 

We show up at the airport, and I realise in my preflight preparation I had neglected to work out whether we could actually carry four people, our bags, and full tanks. A 172 can't take off with that much weight. So we had to leave some stuff behind and switch to a different plane that had half tanks, with the plan to refuel at Tofino just before leaving. 

We take off. I've flown a few 1-2 hour flights before to new places so I'm not worried about navigating. I've also been there by car many times. We fly over the water for a while, then the land. 

As we get close, I see my worst fear. Fog on the ground. I start panicking and thinking I'll have to divert to my backup, if I can find it. I have an extra 45 minutes of fuel, enough to divert but not enough to get home. I suddenly realise my backup airport doesn't have a gas station and I'd need to call for help. 

Note: Tofino was (is?) an uncontrolled airport at that time, meaning there's no atc. You just listen and talk on a specified frequency and all pilots announce what they are doing and coordinate with each other. 

I don't admit my panic, but I do admit that I can't see our destination and ask everyone to help look. We're scouring the ground, I don't really know where it's supposed to be as in my panic the ground suddenly doesn't look anything like my map.  There's no chatter on the frequency which means no other planes are around. 

All of a sudden my sister shouts ""I see it! Right under us!"" I look down and sure enough I see half a runway disappearing into the fog. 

I make the worst snap decision I have ever made. I announce I'm descending for landing on this runway. I don't care which direction the wind is going. Hell, I can't even see the windsock. I circle around, drop like a stone, and pull the plane in for a landing just as the fog closes in around us. The taxi is through thin fog and visibility is about 100m or so. 

Im delighted to be on the ground. Nobody else realises what just happened. They just want to go surf. 

Story's not over, folks.

We call a cab and surf for the day. It's fun. 

We get back to the airport for the return flight and as part of my checklist I dip the tanks to check how much fuel we have. I do the math, figure out how many gallons to add, and fill up. I pocket the receipt. 

Then, in what is the best snap decision I have ever made, I dip the tanks again. 

It's not even close to what we need to get home. If I had tried to take off, we'd have crashed into the ocean. 

I pull out the receipt and stare at it. The pump dispenses in litres. 

I redo the math, fill up again, and climb back in the cockpit. ""Just thought I'd add some extra to be safe,"" I say with a smile, my heart pounding out of my chest. 

We have a safe flight back home.

None of them ever found out how close we came to death several times that day. I decided I wasn't really cut out to be a pilot as much as I love it. "

Neither the table nor her leggings could support that much weight. She climbed a bar stool like King Kong climbing the Empire State Building and then stomped one foot on the table. She shifted her whole weight down onto the table to bring the other foot up and the table buckled. She fell backwards, hard, onto the tile floor. I wouldn't be surprised if the impact was recorded as seismic activity. Somewhere in her drunken destruction, her leggings ripped at the inseam. And she wasn't wearing underwear."

Which is to say that celebration and flying the rainbow flag and having a whole weekend to be as out and proud as you want is wonderful, but anyone can attend a public Pride party/parade so a lot of what you see isn’t “queer culture”, it’s “street party/exhibitionist culture, featuring queer people who like that sort of thing”.  I don’t think that the SF Pride parade represent me, but then again a parade filled with anxious bisexual engineers wouldn’t really warrant celebration.

Ugh yes....

I always tried to be nice and inclusive but literally none of these have ever ended up well (and a few gay bars ban them where I'm at). 

Before marriage equality, this was an insanely tacky thing to do. ""Hey look, I'm getting married and you can't!"" is how it came off but even afterwards bachelorette parties in gay bars are: 

-Drunk girls being ultra obnoxious. 

-Drunk girls trying to take off the guys shirts, grabbing their crotches, grabbing their asses, etc. 

-Drunk girls getting mad when guys rebuff their advances.

13108,"Boyfriend and I went and saw Slenderman last weekend. Well, we tried to, anyway. I knew it was gonna be a shitty horror movie, but we like that kind of stuff. 

We go in after paying $12 a ticket, and there's an entire row of LOUD teenagers behind us. It's just us and them in the entire theater. I'm not one to make a fuss, so I ignored it as long as I could. I politely asked them to chill out, but things got even worse.

I finally gave up and went and asked the manager to intervene. They did, and they quieted down for all of 10 minutes.

Halfway through the shitty movie, I turned to my boyfriend and said ""dude...let's just leave. This movie is not worth putting up with a bunch of asshole teenagers"".

We left, got 2 free movie tickets for next time, and were pissed that we even wasted that hour of our time. 

The acting was terrible, it was nothing but shitty jump scares, and it wasn't even good in a ""bad horror movie"" way.

We go to the movies 1-3 times a month, and that's the first time I've ever left a movie early. "

Night wraps up and we jump in a taxi, stopping at his place first (it's closer to town than my place). He asks if I want to come in, and I say something to the effect of ""No, not tonight"" which he takes like a champ. We kiss and I'm on my way home solo in a taxi he paid for.

Next day he's blowing up my phone saying how he could rape me and get away with it because I'm into kinky stuff.

We were riding a tram down the mountain after a bit of sight-seeing and a middle aged couple sparked up a conversation with my grandparents telling them that I was an adorable child. Jokingly (obviously) my grandparents asked them if they wanted to take me off their hands to which their response was ‘yes please, we’ll even pay you!’ My grandparents kind of shrugged it off as a joke until the couple started asking personal questions like what our address was, what hotel we were staying at, what my grandparent’s last name was, etc. By that time the tram ride was over and my grandparents bee-lined our way toward the car making sure to keep a good grip on my sister and I... 20-30 minutes later, we made it back to the hotel only to find that the couple had followed us. My grandfather approached them and threatened them with calling the police, they then turned around and we never saw them again... "

13161,"Aprox. 18 years ago, when IRC chatrooms ruled the Internet, my cyber-buddies and I started to play hackers and infect people with trojan horses just to mess with them. Nothing too serious, open cd, close cd, and so on. We were just kids. Anyway. Because we were teenagers, we were starting to develop an interest in finding people’s porn folder, and downloading it for our own pleasure. We were not prepared for what we found. There’s no unseeing that shit, some images still haunt me 17 years later. We found quite a number of pedophiles with massive amounts of child porn, and us being kids, we had no idea what to do with that knowledge. That was when I left my hacker friends, who I later lesrned started cooperating with local authorities to help identify the perpetrators.

13180,"No, she was a friend of my wife's and she stopped making any effort to keep in touch once she moved out. Fine by me.

To be honest, her stay with us damn near caused serious issues in our marriage where I was sick and tired of her taking advantage of us, while my wife was trying to be very passive in an effort to not let it get to her. Culminated in me having a serious talk with our guest, setting down rules as if she were a child (much to my disappointment and embarrassment) and her ultimately moving out due to it.

I just wanted to spend some time with him before I potentially die and this is what I got.  Well, I lost my fucking shit right there in the hospital lobby.  I screamed at him, telling him what a fucking shitty father and person he is and how he needs to hear this now because if I die he'll never know.  It was quite the scene.

Also, men are seen as in a position of power and also due to biology have stronger physiques so no offense but just because you brush off a sexual assault on your person, doesn't mean a small girl or woman would do the same.

""You know, if I can home with a $30k Harley Davidson without telling my wife, she'd be upset. And she'd have every right to be, that's a lot of money. But if I came home, having made this decision for her, she'd be happy. Taking the stress of making the decision off of her for the good of the family.""

Well this pastor is known for his extremely long masses. Me and my sister sat at our table and went along with the motions of the mass. Halfway threw the mass he stops and decided to talk about how amazing the weather is. My sister turns and whispers to me “is he kidding me he’s talking about the weather? What’s next small talk?” Well oddly enough he starts to talk about how he’s he’s happy for our family and how he would love a chance to get to know at least the front row a little bit more to make the mass more personal. Me and my sister started laughing.  We could not believe this was going on in the middle of the service. Needless to say my ultra religious grandma kicked us out and we sat in the kitchen with the food eating before anyone else. So worth it.

I think it's probably very easy to cheat if the right circumstances come about. I've never cheated before, but do believe I'm capable of it. Years ago I thought *oh if you love someone you couldn't possibly cheat* but relationships aren't some black or white, love or no love, equation. Then again, as you've pointed out, I've had some buddies who were flat out assholes about it. One dude told me he and his girl had an open relationship. The night we're all supposed to hang he makes sure and lets me know that I shouldn't mention that to her.

WIFEY: When did you become a porn star?"
13400,"When someone says this, what they really mean is ""this sucks... I don't wanna do it"".

Guess what one of the single most useful skills in the ""real world"" is?

Getting yourself to do that thing that sucks and you don't wanna do it.  Everyone has one of these classes, and they are the single most important classes in your education, because they teach you self discipline, and self discipline applies to any job and many other situations that you face in ""real life.""  

You want to be a successful musician?  You better learn to call around for gigs and keep a detailed schedule.  If someone returns your call and asks if you're free from X-Y on Z date, you want to be able to find it quickly and not fumble around for ten minutes making a poor impression or worse, commit to a date and later find you actually had a conflict.  Artists are not ones to be detail oriented, but the ones who can make that kind of career work, are the ones to can do the stuff that sucks along with being good artists.

You want to be a pro athlete?  You better be able to tell your brain to shut up and just do it when doing endurance training, because every sport needs endurance training at least to some extent... it often sucks to be doing it.  A basketball player doesn't want to spend hours on the exercise bike or run lines, these are some of the things most dreaded in an basketball player's training schedule, but a strong endurance basketball player does have a distinct advantage.

Every job good and bad has some aspect that makes you go ""this sucks... I don't wanna do it"" and every REALLY successful person has the self discipline to tell their body / brain to shut up and do it anyway.

So whenever you are coming across one of those classes that make you say something like ""I'll never use this,"" you're wrong.  You're learning self-discipline, and it is an extremely important skill for not just work, but life in general."

13417,"Dimensional analysis is basically making sure you keep units with numbers, and making sure everything still matches up.

Say you want to convert 500 miles to kilometers. You look up that there are 1.61km in a mile. So, let's do the conversion, making sure we keep our units.

500 miles * (1 miles/1.61km)  =   500 miles * miles / 1.61km  = 310.56 miles^2 / km.

Wait. Square mile per kilometer? What does that even mean?

Dimensional analysis catches that we divided when we should have multiplied to convert miles to kilometers. If we did it correctly,  500 miles * ( 1.61km / miles ) = 805 km . The miles cancel out. The dimensions make sense.

It's basically just stuff like that. Keep track of your dimensions (units), and make sure you don't accidentally 'gain' or 'lose' something. You can logically figure and double-check out a lot of conversions just by keeping track of the dimensions and making sure you don't magically lose or gain a dimension at some step during your calculation.

My problem is that this is one of the very first things people ask me...people have asked me what my name is and then immediatelt where I'm REALLY REALLY from. It shouldn't be the first thing you ask someone, you wouldn't really ask a white person what their ethnicity is off the bat. It makes me feel like they think I'm less American and more a foreigner when people prioritize my ethnicity over everything else.

If you're just asking if someone is from around your area, that's fine!! But don't keep badgering them for their ethnicity if that's not what you asked for in the first place.

Thanks for asking! "

Otherwise his holding of the office taints and cheapens it, devaluing America on the world stage. Having multiple affairs right after your wife just gave birth would qualify.

But really, I doubt that had he just let the news get out, it would have impacted him an any meaningful way. If the Access Hollywood tape didn't do it, the accounts of affairs certainly wouldn't. However, he decided to pay hush money right before the election to keep the information out of the press, and he wasn't careful enough in how he did it to properly navigate existing campaign finance laws, so he has committed a likely felony. That's what we care about more than the affair, the commission of a crime in trying to cover up the affair."

13461,"Mothman: in 1966, Point Pleasent, West Virginia, two grave workers were digging in a cemetary, when they saw a gray figure standing on a rooftop. The figure was humanoid, 7ft tall, and had glowing red eyes. All of a sudden, the creature sprouted wings which were previously tucked against it's body, and flew away at around 70mph. They reported the sighting to the police, and since they were well-known in the community, their story was taken seriously. 

The next day, two couples were driving along a quiet strip when they encountered the same figure reported to the police, which hadn't made it's way into local news yet. It was standing, wings outstretched, in the middle of the road. Upon getting caught in the headlights, the creature took off, and continued to chase them up to 90mph, and it was reported that it didn't flap its wings, but glided above them silently.

The group didn't report this to the police, as they were afraid of being ridiculed, so instead they went back to the same strip the next night, and saw it there again. It hadn't seen them, but they managed to observe it searching for food in a nearby field, it was after this when they reported it to the police, presenting their evidence, and the police officially put this creature on the local watchlist.

Over 100 other sightings were reported in Point Pleasent from 1966-1967, ranging from the creature passively watching from a rooftop before leaving, to a case where it attacked a woman and her baby, ending with the woman diving on the ground over the infant to protect it, and the creature losing interest.

The last sighting took place in 1967, when the Silver Bridge collapsed. People reported sightings of the humanoid clinging onto the suspension bridge, and hours later, the bridge collapsed, killing 46 people.

The newspapers nicknamed this creature: ""The Mothman"""

* focus on your breathing, set a rhythm, make it steady


* focus on a block of solid colour (idk why this works for me but it does)


* find a wall or similar to get a solid object against your back (gets rid of the paranoid feeling like you're about to be attacked from behind, I used to sit in baths or hide in closets too for similar results)

""But in the case of Doyle, he didn't want to kill off Doyle. It just became a situation. The work situation became difficult.... It's hard enough to make a television show without the headaches"".

13628,"Well it depends on the type of aircraft. On small, single engine aircraft such as a Cessna 172, this is a correct statement. You can see this this by the stall horn sounding right before a “correct” landing in one of these types of aircraft. This is done because these aircraft don’t sink very well and because they are so small you can bash them around more than say a larger aircraft. In the case of larger aircraft it’s actually much different. At lower speeds, larger aircraft actually tend to use Newton’s third law quite a bit. This is why commercial airliners come in to land at such a steep angle of attack, with their nose pointed in the air. This steep angle of attack is close to a stall but not quite a stall, when these airliners approach the ground they encounter what is know as he ground effect. The ground effect allows aircraft to flare and float, providing for a smooth landing. If all goes well the sink speed should slow and ease the aircraft on to the ground without stalling the aircraft. Do keep in mind that the aircraft is approaching a stall but not actually in one."

We graduated the same year,  but they're all crazy successful now. They were making big purchases like it was nothing and have great places in awesome neighborhoods. Meanwhile, I had to move back home to live with my parents while I look for a new job.

Again just what this manager thinks happened, he did not work there at the time of the disappearance. If you’ve ever been to ugly tuna or stayed after hours at most bars, you’d probably believe this.

When my mom found out she was really pissed off, and I felt really unappreciated for my persistence and problem solving skills.

Leviticus was originally used by God for his chosen people to set them apart from the other tribes around them. There are a lot of oddly specific rules which don’t make sense normally, but with this context, explain a lot of them.

The other thing is, when God sent Jesus, the laws which were used to keep you Holy were abolished (so Leviticus, and numbers as well I believe?) because no one is perfect, and Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice. You can see it in acts where Peter is told by God that no food is unclean (forgotten the exact verse) and it is the same with the vast majority of rules, including tattoos, which are written in Leviticus!

13758,"&gt; Being a people person opened way more doors than my barely slightly above 3.0 GPA ever did

Yup. Early on I ended up asking a professor for advice once on an extra credit project and he walked me through some of it (if you care, it was an early electronics project and I didn't quite understand part of the math behind it, which was important for the project).

I credit that one event with pretty much the rest of my career success. After that class he offered me a TA position grading papers, then later a position teaching labs, then later a research assistantship, which ended up paying for my grad-school. I worked with people on that research project that later started a company and hired me (and the company ended up becoming somewhat of a success in the gaming industry). I didn't stay there but by that time I had an _enormous_ advantage over people that were just graduating...real world experience, well-known research projects under my belt, recommendations from professors, etc.

I truly believe that _all_ of this came about because I was personally friendly and inquisitive with a professor. And FWIW, I had good grades but was not a top-tier student."

I can sort of understand this one. We have a similar rule for our kids, but not as strict. Basically, only play with 1 type of toy at a time. Like in your example, they could play with all the barbies they want, but put the barbies away before you go play something else.

Just a poor little baby. He's in emergency foster care. Everyone begs the court to sever the parent's rights, because the violence against the child is escalating.

Parent finishes short jail sentence, drug treatment program, petitions for custody, wins, and the baby is dead less than a month later.  The day his death hit the newspaper and I had the pleasure of picking up my roommate and some of the other Child Services employees up from the bar where they were all drunk, crying and hating the judge and hating the public who have no idea how hard they fought for that child to stay in foster care.

These employees who did everything they legally could -  received death threats, calls for their termination, calls for audit etc.  What makes this even sadder is these idealistic young community spirited attorneys, could have done so much good - but they all eventually resigned because the job was literally impossible if they couldn't protect their clients."

13949,"Ohhh Intriguing question!

 I'd be interested: 

A: Is there any light source or is it pitch dark? If there is light: is it natural or electric? How bright? Is there a light switch? Does it have a cycle?

B: how hard is the ground? What is the surface made of? (There is a huge difference between rough concrete, wood and a carpet if I have to sit and sleep there for days.)

C: Is there toilet paper?

D: Is there a sink? If no, can I open up the toilets water supply to wash my self? Is it a country with clean water?

E: I guess I can't use soap or brush my teeth? (As is isn't listed.)

F: is the room at least big enough to move a little? (To do something like 5 steps.)

G: Must the food be sweetened with sugar? Could I have something simple like rice and vegetables? (Especially if I can't brush my teeth.)

Depending on those questions, I think psychologically I could hold out some days: (edit / ps: i'd aim for 15 days!)

I'll do alot of breathing exercises, work on extending the volume of my lungs and try to give my self a natural high with it.

I'll keep my mind occupied and practice singing, whistling and rhyming. I'd practice speaking, imitating accents and simple math.

I'll practice meditation. (A lot of people do things like weekly meditation retreats with no talking, but they have beds to sleep in.)

I'll do ALOT of stretching.

I'd do a ton of body weight exercises.
I'll practice balance. (One leg stands, different planks.)
As well as practice movement like dancing and martial art exercises. I don't even need much space for that. This would keep me occupied for hours each day. (Traditional / internal martial arts are perfect for that, you have alot of exercises that won't strain your body that you could keep doing.)

I can think of two possible reasons:


1) To avoid him adding extra sugar. If he tried the plain pancake and realised that he liked it enough without sugar/syrup/whatever, then he wouldn't add something unhealthy unnecessarily. My Mum had a similar rule which basically boiled down to 'try it first'. This kid's mother's reaction sounds well OTT, but the rule isn't a bad one in theory. 



2) There's an old politeness convention which states you shouldn't add seasoning/sauces etc to a meal that's served to you by someone else, because it's an insult to their cooking. Could be related to that? IMO this is less reasonable than the health concern though.

Or anther example is telling the guys to to the ""picking up and moving things"" kind of tasks while telling the girls to the ""organizing and cleaning"" kind of tasks. Just ask for volunteers are split them up by some arbitrary measure like left side &amp; right side of the room. 

It's not that she's homophobic or transphobic, it's just habits we've developed that we need to break to be more inclusive.

14021,"From an economic and fiscal perspective, healthcare is a captive market. In the traditional conservative free market theory, the cost of the service (i.e., healthcare) should be a function of the demand and quality. Healthcare isn’t that way, it’s to a large degree inelastic—when you need health care, you have no other choice.

That means that there’s a point where the quality of the healthcare no longer is a function of the cost, and the cost is no longer a function of the quality.

As a result, there’s literally trillions of dollars lost in defaulted medical debt, in productivity lost, in other resulting costs on the labor market that hurt both the government and private industry.

In that way, healthcare reform can be a very conservative idea. Though it’s acknowledging a limit of free market theory, in regulating or even nationalizing the market we create the opportunity to save lots of money and create a more productive nation.

It’s also a very conservative idea in the sense that conservative values include supporting and upholding their communities and families. It’s saying that we value our neighbors more than we value the opportunity for innovation and growth that a privatized health sector offers. Preserving the health of the community over the opportunity for technological progress? That’s a conservative idea. "

This has become a style of documentary making in recent decades (to the point where people don't know what to make of documentaries that avoid doing this), but it is not true to the genre. 

One of my favorite documentaries was a German doc about prostitution. It had no narration, simply took you from location to location and showed you the industry in different cities at different levels of poverty and desperation. It trusted the audience to draw their own conclusions from the content that was presented before them and let the subjects speak for themselves. It won't pretend it was the best documentary ever, and the cinematography was lacking, but goddamn if I don't respect its style and how it avoided the narrative dynamic found in many documentaries these days.

My dad always told my brothers and I: when u see a cop, your number 1 goal is to get as far away from them as possible. Be nice, don’t look suspicious, but distance yourself as much as possible. Cops barely graduated high school and almost certainly have a chip on their shoulder. They can kill you and all they’ll get is a paid vacation for it. GET AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE FROM UNEDUCATED ARMED PEOPLE WITH LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS. "

14252,"Yesterday I lost my shit. Happy to say my neighbor and gf stopped me before the cops did.

I live in the city centre of Amsterdam. The last couple of years the amount of tourist visiting Amsterdam has increased exponentially. This would be okay, except many tourists come here for the partying, smoking weed, drinking, etc. For the last couple of years there’s been an increase in noise disturbance, people throwing rubbish on the streets, canals, tourist smoking weed and playing loud music in front of my door. Besides there has been an increase in drugs being sold on the streets, violence, burglary and thievery. 

The building I’m living in is being renovated. Around the building is a scaffolding structure. Yesterday evening I saw someone walking on it. I assumed the person was a burglar and I directly called the police. On the phone the police told me they were on their way. I went outside and noticed some people standing outside. Their look told me they knew more about it. I asked them, but said they no. I looked up and noticed 3 guys coming down from the scaffolding structure. When they were on the ground I cornered them with the believe they were burglars. The guys told me they were sorry, but I wouldn’t budge. One minute later the police arrived and asked what they were doing. But okay, I was extremely angry. The 3 guys kept telling they were sorry, and they made a mistake.
The girl I asked before if she knew more suddenly told me *she was with them and they just wanted to have fun, and see the view from above. She told me to act  and behave normal.* 

That’s the moment I lost my shit with her."

I'm not perfect and I spiraled a bit after this happened but everything is now back on track.

I stayed for a couple more years in the city I grew up bit about four years ago I decided I had to leave.

Everywhere I went there was reminders of all the bad times and I would constantly bump into people who treated me like (and now tried acting friendly towards me).

I don't know if the change in attitude towards me was out of guilt, respect, fear or a mixture of all three but I found it very hard to deal with. 

For example, a person who would kick me in the ribs repeatedly would now try and act like an old friend when I bumped into them on the street.

I couldn't deal with it, so I moved as far away as humanly possible.

I now live in a new city and have virtually no contact with my past life. No-one at my work will ever know what I have seen and what I have had to do, and that's okay.

It's a small price to pay for the peace I now have.

Second, they want to know what their constituents care about, that’s why. You have one vote just like everybody else. And calling makes you unusually engaged, so potentially going to influence others. 

So just say something like “I’m a constituent and it’s important to me that Senator so-and-so votes for net neutrality.” Say why if you want.

It's just assuming that every population is having a resource issue and that everyone will benefit from it.

I'm sure there are planets out there where the population had successfully found a way to sufficiently distribute resources to benefit all. I'm sure there are planets out there where that's not even an issue at all. 

Also even if you assume every population is so overwhelmed solely by overpopulation, which is almost certainly not true since we've seen many planets doing just fine, it's at best a short-term fix. The population will come back and have the same issues, but now probably only worse since the set back of randomly losing half the population (and the very real likelihood that total production will be severely damaged as society will effectively fall apart).

The other half of your question is a bit of a gray area - ""ain't"" is a fairly flexible word as far as definitions go.  According to Miriam Webster, it can work out to  any of the following, based on context:
&gt;1 : am not : are not : is not  
2 : have not : has not

14423,"Yes in fact there is.  The japanese language has three different alphabets. two of them hiragana(ひらがな) and katakana(カタカナ) just have every character assigned to syllables あ=ア=a か=カ=ka さ=サ=sa etc. They are not too hard to learn since there are like 45  characters in each alphabet . These caracters are combinations of consonants followed  vowels since in japanese every single syllable has a consonant followed by a vowel(except for single vowels  a i u e o and the only consonant which can be followed by another n=ん). But of course there are a lot of homophones since in japanese a syllable is ALWAYS  pronounced the same, which is different from english where ""a"" can be pronounced in like 5 different ways varying with the word you use  it in + if a word has 5 sounds you'd use 5 letters in english but just 3 in japanese    for example ( さかん= sakan ;means popular) so you have less possible combinations of syllables so less different words. The last 3 characters were from the first alphabet hiragana.

The first two characters were from the 3rd alphabet kanji(漢字). These are chinese letters repurposed for japanese meaning you have multiple readings for these ones and they have a meaning attached to them they aren't just phonetical syllables( they are basically simplifed drawings of the things they want to represent  山= yama means mountain) . And instead of 50 there are about 2000 characters you have  to learn. Of course there would be more than hiraganas and katakanas since there are a lot of meanings you have to express. Katakana is mostly used for loanwoards hiragana is used for grammatical particles and kanji for nouns verbs etc. Kanji solves the issue of homophones and of readability(20 hiraganas one after another would be hard to read ) because even tho words are read the same they are written with different kanji

14427,"Multiple cancer survivor here. I was going through my first round of treatment when he was at his peak. I absolutely loved his story, and it gave a young kid like me hope that I’d still be able to live a completely normal life after all was said and done.

A year later my first relapse happened, and in-between the couple months of normal treatment and upcoming stem cell transplant I started to wonder with those close to me if someone who had gone through a (from what I understand) fairly intensive treatment regimen could *really* recover to the point he did.

Second relapse happens, and the doping accusations had been picking up steam for the past year. At this point I always laughed (on the inside) when people tried to claim he didn’t dope. I mean, you probably don’t get to that level without doping, period, and you definitely don’t get there after you’ve been pummeled with cancer therapy.

14439,"Now see, I'm just a Marvel Comic pleb, but here's my personal opinion on what will happen:


The next Infinity War movie has to have a villain or else there's no plot.  BUT if Thanos still has the stones it would make him basically impossible to beat.  Ergo I think the gauntlet is shattered.  The dwarves made the gauntlet to ""harness the power of the infinity stones"" which leads me to believe you can't use all the power of the stones with just your body or it either won't work or it'll destroy you.  Using that much power to snap away half of life destroyed the gauntlet meaning Thanos currently can't really use the stones, making him effectively mortal again so the remaining heroes can go try to stop him.  There's a second gauntlet shown in the film and I think they'll need that to ""un-snap"" everyone who was killed.


There's another hypothesis that those killed by the stones go ""inside"" the soul stone and that there could be a secondary team working from inside the soul stone to free themselves or something.  Some of the people who like this hypothesis think that perhaps Thanos's scene at the end with the sunrise in which he's suspiciously in a different place and without the gauntlet means he's also dead and in the stone, but I don't think so.  If he's dead it means there's no BBEG to lead the armies to stop the remaining Avengers from undoing the snap, and we all know there has to be a big army vs. army fighting scene.


And so help me if the first half of the next movie is in-fighting between the remaining Avengers I'm going to scream."

Yes, at one point Loki was a villain, but his role has since changed to an anti-hero (that is, if OP is exclusively talking about in the movies). Think of his role in Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War. Anti-heroes are characters that do *not* have heroic qualities, (sometimes they even have villainous ones), but are either considered protagonists or are on the protagonist's side for the time being. Most anti-heroes only join the ""good"" side for selfish reasons, and they usually have a chaotic neutral standpoint."

14484,"I worked in one in high school. Don't blame the employees for not knowing stuff, they get practically zero training. My first day they sat me through a 30 minute training video that explained what 720p meant and the difference between CRT and LCD and Plasma, and the difference between composite video, S-video, and component video. In almost 2 years, that was the only paid training I received. People would come in and ask really specific questions and then get offended if you didn't know the answer. I was pretty techy and knew the answers to most stuff because it was a hobby as well. But people would come in with some janky convoluted home theater setup and ask all sorts of oddball questions, then get pissed when the person making $8 an hour with minimal training can't figure out how to reroute the subwoofer channels of a 5.1 home theater receiver into a phono input on a 1970s receiver that they bought at a garage sale to give a bass output from the movie they are watching in the living room to some additional speakers on the patio, or some equally bodgy setup. 

At the time, we had ended commission based sales in order to lower prices, so there was very little incentive to embark on hours of research on your own time to stay caught up with the latest tech and learn the intimate details of every product in the store. Or even if you're a really smart computer or home theater guy, then someone comes in and has a dozen extremely specific questions about a cordless phone or one of the random other types of products that we carry. 

It unfortunately didn't really have a winning proposition, to pay the employees enough and give enough training to really be experts on the subject, they would have to raise prices, and they were already competing with websites undercutting them. It was just becoming a thing back then where people would come into the store, spend 30 minutes looking at TVs and asking questions, then go home and order it online to save $20. Once that became the norm, raising prices enough to retain an expert staff would be impossible. As it was, the only thing the store made money off of was overpriced accessories and extended warranties, the big ticket items we were barely breaking even on. We would end up selling a $3,000 TV at $5 above our cost just to make a sale and hope that we could get a $30 HDMI cable that cost us $5 in their cart too.

14540,"In my opinion, the most important thing to keep in mind is that, for the most part, people are fairly predictable in wanting what is beneficial and avoiding what is negative. What I mean by this is, if you find yourself in a situation where you are being robbed or your home is being broken into, you should remember that the people who are committing the crime have a particular desire, more often than not either money or goods that can be exchanged for money, and they would rather avoid things like life sentences for murder if it can be helped. So if you find yourself in a situation where you are being accosted, as long as you act in a way that does not interfere with your assailant's ability to get what they want, you will almost certainly get out of the situation alive. I am well aware that this is not always the case, and some people are simply so detached from reality or mindlessly vicious that they are just going to behave violently regardless of the consequences, but I have spent long stretches of my life living in shady places, both as a broke college student in North Philly and as a heroin addict on the streets of Hartford, I have personally been robbed at knife point, and have had many friends who have had the same thing happen to them, and the only time any of them were ever injured was when they did things to resist their attacker. Always remember that the evening news doesn't cover the thousands of robberies that end with just a person losing their possessions, but will cover the rare exception where a person is killed.

I've never owned a firearm, so I can't speak to whether these are helpful or not, but I can say that having a pit bull will do wonders to keep you safe. The college I went to in North Philly was in a neighborhood that had rapidly deteriorated, and I had moved into a house a few blocks off campus to save on rent. This neighborhood was ""multiple police homicides during the few years I lived there"" bad, and my first year I had my house broken into, but on my third year I got a pit bull, who had the habit of sitting on the radiator and staring out the first floor window whenever nobody was home, and we were the only college students on the block who did not get our homes broken into.

Go with your instincts. Your mind is capable of registering far more about your environment and the people in it than you are consciously aware of, so if it starts sending you danger signals you should really listen to them. It is all but a cliche that the survivors of encounters with serial killers say ""I just knew something felt off about him, even though I couldn't put my finger on it."", so if you wanna be one of the people who lives through to the end of the movie, then go with your gut.

My last tip is hardest to quantify, but it relates to both the first and the third. Imagine you are looking to rob someone. You're skulking around with a gun tucked into your pants and waiting for a good opportunity. What you are looking for is someone who has money and is not going to force you to kill him to get it (the cops expend a lot more effort pursuing homicides than armed robberies). What you would likely do is observe the people around you and find a person who looks weak, relying more on gut instincts than any kind of fixed metric. Thus it is a good idea for anyone who doesn't wish to get robbed to carry themselves in a manner that does not scream weakness. I would not consider myself a particularly tough person, but I have survived a number of very harsh environments, including dangerous neighborhoods, living out of my car, and incarceration, and I think a lot of my success comes from being able to cultivate the appearance of not giving a fuck. One thing that I have done when I've been in dangerous situations is I'll begin repeating to myself that death isn't that big of a deal. That it will just be a quick fade to black and then nothing, and that therefore I have no reason to be afraid of it. I obviously can't say for sure that this was a factor in saving my ass, but I nevertheless believe that if you can really put yourself in that frame of mind, it goes a long way towards projecting the impression that you probably shouldn't be fucked with."

Everyone just scowled at the ground like they were pissed at the world while they walked 100mph to get wherever they were going.  Just seemed really cold and angry.  We weren't used to that type of environment, and we probably cataloged them subconsciously as assholes.  When I moved to Dallas as an adult, I started to get it.  It's just the city environment.  They're used to being surrounded my masses of humanity every day, squeezing through crowds and trying to go about their business as quickly as they can.  If you waved and said hello to everyone you passed, you'd lose your voice by midday and be late for everything.

Which means, if he didn't get wrapped up in the parachute from the shock of opening and his lack of experience (he never checked his reserve - it was an dummy package for training), he almost certainly had hypothermia by the time he landed. Between that and the wet area, he had basically no chance of starting a fire. He most likely curled up under a tree and died.

He got on his motorcycle and decided not to wear any gear since it was just a few blocks away. You can see where this is going.

He lived in St. George, Utah at the time. A popular activity there is sand duning. Part of doing that is lowing the air pressure in the tires. The motorcycle he took had tires like this. He was going downhill when the motorcycle flipped forward, launching him forward. Luckily, he was thinking quick enough to cover his head with his arms. His forearms got horrendous road rash. Bits of glass and asphalt had to be picked out, which was the most painful part according to him. He also landed on his knee and skinned it clear to the bone. He only had a couple scratches on his head but his arms and right knee were messed up. A passerby saw it, called an ambulance, and luckily one was near by so he didn't have to wait long.

To this day, he has big pink patches on his arms and his right knee is a little weaker than the other. Moral of the story, even if it's just a couple blocks in town, ALWAYS wear proper gear. Also, check the air pressure in your tires all the time. "

Said friend  got very drunk one night and along with some buddies thought it was a great idea to break into our school. They climbed over the fence to the school grounds which triggered some sort of alarm alerting the police. Anyway they really wanted to get inside the school building. So they smashed in 6 windows, one for every one of them, to enter the school. Then the police arrived and they went into full panic mode. 2 hid under a pile of leaves. 3 just climbed on the roof of a shed and lay as flat as possible. Only one of them was caught but he thought it was a good idea to try and outrun the police but in the end he didn't snitch. The remaining 5 just waited it out and weren't discovered."

You have to deny them not only luxuries but sometimes basic human rights, there's younger people who are not yet tainted by the mental toll it takes on you and those who have done it for so long they just become an emotional husk. Angry at every discrepancy or attempt at being sneaky. Imagine coupling this with a poor home life (not every CO has a bad home life but nobody is immune to domestic issues) and you have a recipe for depression, the only outlet being inmates.

 The corrections system in the United States, more specifically NY, has some problems. After researching the Attica prison riot I understood it was a lot worse, but still needs work. From what I know the resources for rehabilitation exist, but you need to seek out help on your own, it will not just happen. I understand that inmates have broken the law and need to pay their debt to society, but it's a person. A son or daughter and sometimes a father or mother. In the United States the re-offending  rate is over 60%. People can go in for minor infractions and end up spending a lot more time than they planned behind bars. I don't believe there are bad people and I've seen many people turn their lives around, including my family members who would probably be dead if it wasn't for their incarceration. I've also heard of people who are going to die in prison, and they know it. For them the re-offending rate doesn't matter, they are stuck their for the rest of their lives. It's up to them to make the most of it and find peace in however a way they choose, and more often than not they don't. Thankfully those I know personally have managed to go from the worst people I knew morally to the best, it's unbelievable and I miss them incredibly but I wouldn't have it any other way.

TL;DR: prison sucks, a lot, but it doesn't have to. Prisoners are people, human beings. Also research the attica prison riot. "

14900,"I've had a long, interesting history with my coffee addiction.

It started when I finished college. I was 18 with no sense of direction - I began drinking coffee at work. Day in, day out. One cup became two, and two cups would become three. Here I was, blindly traversing down a bitter path to caffeinated enlightenment.

I caught on to the problem before it became a problem. I wanted to get better - I really did. But underneath the fragility of my teenage years, was an underlying sense of loneliness - the kind of loneliness I did not want to confront. So everytime I began to feel lonely, I'd get coffee. I didn't think much more of it.

The money I spent added up. All of my friends were moving out, buying new cars and living their best lives - I was spending £50 a day on gourmet coffees. I was poor, I was losing my friends, and I was lonelier with every day that passed.

I was 21. My teenage years had passed me. My teeth were stained, my breath was smelly and I was completely unloveable, or so I thought.

I had been promoted in this time - I was now in charge of training the new starters. Which is what I was doing today.

The new girl - Sacha - was sweet. She smelled like bubble gum and she had long, curly hair. She was everything I wanted my future to be, and we got on well. Better than I could have ever anticipated.

Sacha and I grew close. We grew more than close - we grew old. 10 years went by as if it were 10 minutes and no day felt like we loved each other any less than the day before. I stopped drinking coffee - it was harder than I thought it could be. I went to decaff, and then to nothing at all.

I was 32 when Sacha was hit by the driver. She was walking home after dinner with her mum, and a drunk college kid from the next town over hit her on the short walk home. I know he got sentenced though I was in a bubble of grief - I remember nothing of the trial. I hope that kid sorted himself out, I hope he makes someone happy and someone makes him happy someday.

It's been five years since Sacha passed. I've not been dating since - I couldn't bring myself too. Yesterday though, I decided to to sign up for Plenty of Fish.

In face, I matched with an incredible woman. Smart, pretty, funny. She just sent me a text.

She has also written about abusing her sister, in her own book. She is not a feminist. She used the label, but doesn’t do the work.  Lena only cares about her and her friends gains and problems. She is absolute trash. She gives people who are against feminism power, they use her as an example for all of us. She is not good for feminists.

There is nothing ""logical"" about not bothering to read actual fucking scientific papers and journals.

People don't want to be wrong anymore.

I feel like there is a SERIOUS problem with society and wanting to feel special, and not being able to accept you can be wrong. I also feel like there are issues with people not being able to properly research and discern information, and possibly the whole parent/non parent ""I need to be the perfect person/mommy so everyone can see how good I am!"" bullshit that I see prevalent on facebook and in real life.

I probably sound like a crazy person, but after seeing so many rising numbers of anti-vax bullshit, I've become increasingly heated on the subject because I have family who can and will fucking DIE if some dumbass doesn't vaccinate Jimmy and he gives them whatever illness from the bowels of hell. 

Antivaxxers don't get to be treated reasonably when they are choosing to jeopardize other people because they can't pull their head out of their asses long enough to think logically. They don't get to be treated reasonably when they think their child should fucking die rather than have autism. It is become a serious problem, and it needs to be addressed. /rant"

It would stay green if we were quiet, turn yellow if we were getting too loud and finally on red it would trigger the alarm system. Turns out it was triggered by its own alarm and once it got going it was completely unable to calm itself back down. The teacher spent more time that week dealing with that stupid light than she did telling us to shut up all year."

Really, what loss prevention specialist thought it'd be a good idea to alarm an attempt to pay, and not an attempt to not pay? I'd think paying a pair of human eyeballs minimum wage would be cheaper than the increase of ""shrinkage"" through those self-checks, but what do I know.

As a temp I was exempt from the metrics the full-timers were stuck with which meant my average call was 17 minutes (it was supposed to be 5 max) but my success rate was so much higher and the comments from the callers were incredibly positive simply because I could walk them through the issue and make sure things were working.

Yes, I am serious. When I managed a storage facility a while back I rented a space to two recently married women. They were both very sweet and friendly and I loved it when they came in.

They only rented for a few months as they had moved to the area, found a house, and bought it. After they'd been gone for a while I realized that I knew very little about them, stuff that I often know about people who rent for several months, who are new to the area, or who are looking to buy a home.

I hadn't done my usual things to get to know them better and offer any other assistance that I could. To me they were the cute lesbian couple. Now I remember them as the cute couple who happened to be lesbian. I wish that was how I'd thought of them back then.

So, Yes I do want to know how you like your PB&amp;J. Now, I don't expect there to be just one answer. I'll take the scores on various replies as a rough reflection of the preferences. So hopefully no one will downvote Orange Marmalade just because they don't like it."

15194,"This is something I wasn't taught in highschool sex Ed, but as a college student, I was studying criminology, social work and family violence prevention, the idea of consent came up a lot. Putting a term to being a decent human being regarding sex is a fairly new thing, especially one that's so cut and dry. The difference is that I was taught in highschool to ""never have sex with someone who doesn't want to"" but I wasn't told that ""consent"" (which wasn't the term used, but the idea was to here) HAS to go both ways, that I had the ability to say no and the responsibility to say yes etc. The conversation in highschool felt a lot more like ""yell 'no' if you're being raped cause then they'll call it rape"", not ""you are entitled to control over your own body and if something makes you uncomfortable you have every right to shut it down"". 

The age gap on this is alarming (and highly circumstantial).  There are people who will never understand what we mean by saying ""consent"" and it's terrifying. I had an older professor (70+) in a criminal law class who spent half the class period trying to get us to admit that ""sometimes no means yes"". It wasn't a study for him to push us to have convictions on our beliefs, he legitimately didn't see anything wrong with a case study where a college woman was sexually assaulted by a friend in her dorm room after a night of drinking and explicitly said ""no"" but felt unable to physically push him off or remove herself from the situation. There was a point where he made every person in the 40ish person class state that ""no means no"". He eventually ended the class by shrugging us off, preaching his own belief that she was ""playing hard to get"" and we were dismissed. (I wrote a scathing review to the assessment board about the class at the end of the semester but I doubt it'll do anything).

Like, I was taught ""you have a cervix and this is why"" but nothing more, and all the diagrams were side views that made it look like a valve, which super confused me. I didn't realize it was a sphincter until I was looking at videos about natural pain management during childbirth.

Edit: I also didn't realize how short the vagina typically is at rest and how close the cervix is to the opening. The diagrams always made it look super far up your body. I guess the diagrams were really throwing me off. "

15223,"&gt;No country is going to run every test under the sun to everyone coming in that is convinced that they have cancer.  

You don't need to run ""every test under the sun"". You point at a lump. The doctor sees the lump. The doctor feels the lump to determine whether it's eg. cutaneous, subcutaneous, etc. The doctor determines whether it's in a position that could indicate whether it's potentially problematic. The doctor, or lab, performs one or two simple tests - probably a biopsy and/or or a blood panel depending on location. It takes little patient time and labs are super efficient at doing them. It doesn't take much of the doctor's time at all. You go from there.  

Acting like it's near-impossible to efficiently diagnose a lump is a joke."

15232,"You want fucked up? I got my nipples pierced, it was horrible, and because I made the bad decision to do it while working Renn faire (corset-y ouchness) they didn't heal the best so a year later I took them out.

Then I got them pierced AGAIN a few years later. The piercer tried to avoid the scar tissue and pierced one way too shallow SO IT REJECTED. It literally just migrated out from under my nipple. I have a weird scar like a cut on my nipple. It's hardly visible now if I don't point it out, but for years we called it my ""Muppet mouth nipple"" because the skin has healed in two parts and it could kind of open and close. 


Also, the piercer was a friend of a friend and when I saw how shallow the second one was I remarked on it not looking right. He said it was fine and would settle. Apparently immediately after I left the shop he turned to the friend and said, ""That right one is going to reject.""

So fuck you, Gary at Sub Q! "

This girl sat behind me saying horrible things about people loud enough to be annoying but not enough to fully derail class. Eventually she said something that made me snap. I turned around and let her have it. When I was done, the class was silent. My face was flushed when I realized what I'd just done. I turned back to the front thinking I was going to get in trouble for interrupting the class, but my teacher was just leaning back against her desk. She allowed a pause then said, ""you know, Chelsea, she's right, you really shouldn't talk that way about people you don't know.""

You get schooled by a raccoon and eat roadkill, he he. You're making fun of some of the most marginalized people in the country, but Hollywood is still totally ok with it. Not only that its not even original, its played out on its own even if it wasn't cruel. I had professors in college who told me I had to lose my accent to be seen as intelligent outside of the South because of the pop culture stereotypes, thats such bullshit. "
15253,Not OP and my situation wasn't as bad but there was definitely some racist and homophobic stuff. For me it was a self reflection. I'm young so the internet made me more aware of the people around the world. Eventually I realized it was stupid to judge people without knowing them so I just started to change my mindset. It can be difficult though because of the media and changing things you learned while growing up it isn't easy.
15254,"I’m usually really laid back, and it takes a LOT to get me fired up, and there was really only one occasion where I lost it. 

When I was in 7th grade, and I was leaving the building to go home at the end of the day, I saw a boy teasing a girl for the skirt she was wearing. She ignored his silly comments, so his bright idea was to lift up her skirt for whatever reason or another, and that definitely got a reaction. 

I remember her being so embarrassed. After he got his reaction, the little shit decided to shove her towards the stairs, which got a reaction from me. 

Now I wasn’t a very strong boy for my age, I was tall and skinny with very little muscle, so I have no idea where I got the strength to do this, but I ran over and grabbed the boy by the collar of his shirt and held him up to the wall, his feet off the ground. 

I don’t remember what I said, but I remember how scared he looked while I was holding him up yelling at his face. When I finally let go, the boy ran away as fast as he could, and I checked on the girl. 

After the episode, I was sure one of the teachers had heard the whole ordeal go down, and I was sure I was getting into trouble, but I didn’t care, I felt like I had done the right thing. And the best part of the story is 8 years later, I married that same girl, funny how life works like that."

15257,"After a few years I wouldn’t even argue. You want a return? Sure. No receipt? Whatever. If I got talked to about it, I’d say shit like “I’m sorry, I’m just trying to keep our customers happy and avoid a problem” or I break out my notebook and mention when the management would break that policy and “I’m just doing what management has previously done to keep our customers happy.” One of those would work. If management was still upset, I’d call for them in those situations. After a week or so, it’s go back to being how it was. Which I also noted. There really weren’t many policies management wouldn’t break. "
15258,"I got too drunk and had a hookup with someone where I got a hickey out of it. I went to get something for my mother the next day and she saw it, obviously upset. I told her it isn't her business and I'm not going to talk about it with her.

15259,"I totally agree, I never worked retail but I’ve done my time in fast food (which is basically the same thing). The store was shit, nasty all over, food was disgusting, and customers coming through the drive thru would treat me like shit. I once had a guy come in and start ordering stuff from the Taco Bell menu (Taco Bell was the next building over) and when I tried to tell him “Sir, this is Jack in the Box, Taco Bell is next door,” he started yelling at me about how I just didn’t wanna serve him his food. Eventually the manager came to the window where the guy pulled up and explained the exact same thing. Guy drove off without a word to the manager. It’s all just a matter of people thinking ground-level employees are servants paid to do their bidding and take their shit. That’s definitely encouraged by “customer first” logic but it’s also a huge cultural issue of how we view low-income workers "

My heavily pregnant colleague and I were CT scanning an intoxicated young man who had crashed his car directly into a little old lady who subsequently died. 

Guy kept trying to get up and off the CT machine, despite being strapped in and literally taped down. Police officer accompanying him is in back with us, where it's shielded from radiation, because CT uses a hella ton more radiation than x ray. 

So we're scanning his head, neck, and chest/abdomen/pelvis. Dude does the body wave and breaks four restraints and nearly flops off and out of the scanner.

I paused mid scan, nearly broke the door going out to him, and told him to hold the FUCK still so I can see if he broke his GODDAMN NECK. Top of my voice. I'm a 30 year old ex military special ops vet, 6'2, muscled, covered in tattoos.

And to top it all off, the 6 year old was holding the infant and kept making the Dumb and Dumber world's most annoying sound sound directly into the baby's face and this naturally upset the baby who wouldn't stop crying.

I never said anything to them and they didn't even notice I was there. Well this girl, who I'll call Aubrey, liked to try and start shit with me for no reason. Usually I'd just poke holes through her logic and go about my day. Needless to say she tried to start shit with me as soon as I moved down. She said ""Man I'm so sorry you ladies have to sit next to this guy."" I looked at the girls, gave a warm smile, turned around to Aubrey, and said ""I'm sorry Aubrey, were you born with chronic bitchiness or have you just developed this trait over the years?"" Aubrey and the people around me were pretty stunned. I'm a fairly nice person and no one expected me to lose it like that, and I wasn't even that loud.

I think it was only that lonely because the 18th birthday hype is so big for other people, and I don’t remember having any celebration at all for mine.

The doctors leave and a medical student stays behind and talks to me and makes small talk and asked if I was nervous or worried.  I tell her no not all.  She replied back in surprise, ""Really? It's ok if you're nervous."" All the anxiety and worry welled up and I thought I couldn't go through with it.

It usually happened after a weekend of drinking, coupled with not drinking enough water, and/or rough sex, so I figured I had a UTI, would hammer down on the water the next couple of days and it'd go away. I was prone to them when I was younger, didn't see a need to go to the doc since they went away on their own. But I started leaking when I sneezed, and when I coughed, and then when I orgasmed, so that was what finally got me to the Dr, I was embarrassed. I've had 2 kids so I still wasn't worried, thought it happened to most women at some point. Doc did a CT and there it was, plain as day. 

People my age generally don't get bladder cancer, so I chose to go the aggressive route in order to have the best odds of completely getting rid of it (BC is one of the most commonly-recurring cancers). Had my bladder removed at 37 and I'm getting ready to turn 40 with an all-clear every 6 months. My surgeon said my chance of recurrence is about 2% since it hadn't invaded the muscle or escaped the bladder yet. I have an interesting plumbing system now (it's called an Indiana Pouch) but it's nothing more than a minor inconvenience and a frustrating fight with insurance once a year to cover my catheters. And since we caught it so early, I was able to avoid chemo.

My mom was diagnosed with anal cancer about 6 weeks after I was diagnosed with BC. She noticed her poop was always really skinny when it came out. A 10cm tumor was blocking most of her rectum. She passed away last June. A bit of survivors guilt going on with that, ya know? But having cancer together gave us this weird bonding thing towards the end that I think let us end things on a much better note than they would have otherwise. We had a complicated relationship... "

15388,"A coworker tried to file a complaint against me because I spent my own money and my own time making a nacho bar for the entire department, along with some great fruit salad. 

Why was she mad? Because I did not specifically walk to her office and ask her to grab a plate. Her office is 4 feet from the room the food was served in. Anytime I bring food in for my coworkers, and she came through, I always made it a point to let her know to grab some food. Why this time she was just pissed, I don't know. 

Then, I find out after the complaint, which never was taken seriously by HR, that she initially also tried to report me for some sort of sexual harassment because and I quote ""she has too many male friends at work.""

I work in a male dominated area. Its 90% men. They are all mostly around my age. Sorry I don't want to get involved in female gossip. 

In any event, she never brought up the sexual harassment whatever claim in front of HR because then all our coworkers would be pulled in and interviewed as that is part for a IA/HR investigation. Then all of them would know what coworker was doing as well and she would look worse than she already does. 

She still hasn't told anybody why she decided to hate me so much. I have been told she is literally just a miserable person outside of work and has done it to herself over the last 2 decades.

I didn't listen, pressed for a college, they named one nearby, and I went. They taught us a lot of irrelevant old tools and generalist tricks as though we were gonna be one-man dev teams.

The absolute most frustrating thing about being black in America (at least to me) is the ""I can't prove it"" racism.  It's the racists who smile in your face, won't say/do anything outwardly obviously racist but do these small, subtle, covert things that are racist.  Big enough to where it's impactful to you but small enough to where they could easily deny it if you tried to call them out on it.

It's a ""nanana boo boo, you can't get me"" type of feeling because you know they're wrong but there isn't anything you can do about it.  Which is why I really implore more white people (or people of any race where people are being racist) to call out your peers when they say wild shit.  

Men, call out other men if they're being misogynistic.  I don't let my family/friends make fun of asian's eye shape or make jokes about eating dogs, at least not in front of me.

The mystery really isn't who did it, it was definitely one of the sublettor's drunk friends from the night before. The mystery comes from after we cleaned the drawer and put it on the back balcony to air out. Only 3 apartments had access to this back shared balcony with a set of stairs and a locked door at the bottom. The next day the drawer had vanished.

Who took you, poop drawer, and why?"

He was my best friend in the world. He passed unexpectedly. 

I was a wreck for a few days. Then I was pretty numb. Now it's evolved to a deep sadness and there are the days that I still don't believe it's real. More recently, I'll think of him when things are funny and I wish he could see it. The grief is lessened, but it's not gone. 

I lost him four years ago.

I miss him very much."
15491,I’m starting college in like 2 weeks st the age of 24 and have no idea how to study or take notes. In high school I would just re read things but it didn’t really stick
15492,"A lil late but in elementary school, kids would come up to me and pull the corners of their eyes up towards their ears. I was confused about it for a while but once, a kid followed up his routine with ""Am I Asian yet?"". That's when it clicked for me that I was gonna be different and separate from them.

I wised up after the first couple times, so to fight back I would wrench my upper and lower eyelids apart so you could see the edges of my eyeballs and ask ""Am I white yet?"".

...I didn't have many friends in elementary school.

Context: I was one of a few Asian kids at my majority-white elementary school in a historically racist county in the Bible Belt."
15493,"Wow, that takes a lot of introspection and maturity to realize and admit. Good on you for that. I believe you when you say it was mostly down to you, and that she grew up and you didn't, but even if that's true I would caution you from being so down on yourself! That's not going to help you get fix yourself or grow. You are an incredibly mature and intelligent person to have recognized what part you played in your break-up, to have recognized that she's doing better every day and doesn't owe you the service of helping you get better. And just from your few comments here, I have faith in you being able to help yourself. I can see you have your head on straight, and that's the only prerequisite for trying to do and be better."
15494,"This is me right now. I am a full-blood but BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) has my blood quantum as half Ute and half Apache so I qualify for enrollment for one tribe. My father was full-blooded Ute and my mother is full-blooded Apache and both enrolled members of their tribes. My daughter doesn't qualify for membership because her father was Lakota but not enrolled due to adoption. She got a quarter Ute and quarter Apache from me and whatever he qualified for.  My tribe won't enroll her at a quarter and in order to enroll her as Apache I need to disenroll as Ute and enroll as Apache. The Apache will enroll her at a 1/4 blood and her kids would qualify thru descendency. 
My other daughter's father is Ute as well but he is from one of the other Ute tribes. He is enrolled, and she qualifies for enrollment since I am 1/4 of that tribe thanks to my dad's mixed Ute blood. Yay, she can enroll in this tribe but guess what? Thanks to their enrollment rules she would only qualify as 1/2 Ute and 1/4 Ute (my tribe) and 1/4 Apache. 
However, if I enroll her with my tribe she will be enrolled as 3/4 Ute with 1/4 Apache. Her kids, if she chooses to have any, will be enrolled as 1/2 Ute even if she doesn't have kids with a Ute member. 
See, what blood quantum and benefits are doing to our tribal people? Most likely my Apache blood will wither out thru the generations. I am pretty damn proud of being Apache. "
15495,"This sounds strange, but I could see it if you two were teenagers (which it sounds like). Even through the end of college a lot of people have only had one serious relationship. Or maybe she felt you were responsible for the breakups/ending relationships for petty reasons. "

15500,"There is a Model Penal Code that states can choose to adopt. Many of them have adopted slightly altered versions. But states have rights too, and can basically choose what they think is illegal and what isn't. That's why something like marijuana can be illegal at a federal level, but individual states can choose to legalize it. 

I have a very limited grasp of all this and my knowledge on the subject is a bit dated, but basically the individual states are allowed some level of autonomy and control over themselves by the federal government. It is, afterall, the United States of America. "

15509,"It seems like it is heading to that with Melisandre realizing that she was completely wrong about her predictions but there still being a battle of Light vs. Dark. 

The Dark is represented by the now-Undead Gregor Clegane (as Cersei's champion) and Light is represented by the spiritually reborn Sandor Clegane (as Daenerys's Champion - only because he's the one that ones to take down his brother).

Also remember that the magical sword Lightbringer was legendarily tempered by Azor Ahai stabbing it through the heart of his wife meaning that it seems likely that Melisandre will sacrifice her own life in order to create the new Lightbringer which can defeat the Night King.  

The one question that's really up in the air right now is who will wield Lightbringer and be considered Azor Ahai reborn? There's plenty of evidence to show that the prophecy points to Daenerys but in the books Melisandre's visions also point heavily towards Jon Snow being Azor Ahai reborn as well as her prohpecy matching up with Daenerys. Additionally, I think another possibility is The Hound. He was ""born in fire"", nearly died and then was resurrected, and of course we see is character change and grow towards redemption in the latest season. And of course there would be the big plot point of Sandor having to overcome his fear of fire to wield Lightbringer to complete his character arc.

If Cleganebowl happens then I think it's likely that Sandor Clegane will end up being Azor Ahai reborn - it would also be another nice twist in the story since it's been building up to either Dany or Jon being Azor Ahai instead. "

Part of what made us get along so well was that we'd both been left at the altar before, she about eight months before and me almost two years before.  I knew that she had wanted to take her time, and I really saw a future with her, so I said we should cool our jets and take it slow.  She left me for her ex two weeks later.

I was bitter about it for a while, but honestly if my ex had come back so quickly after everything, had turned it around and wanted me back, I think I might have done the same thing.

Knowing the landscape around my house I dismissed it as the trees around my house catching light in a particular way. Moments later I heard steps on my back patio, and rapid knocking on my glass door at that patio. I ran to an adjacent window to peek through the curtains and found that it was my neighbor’s wife. I didn’t really know her well enough to be comfortable so I just watched her silently until she left, then double checked all the locks in my house. Hell of a first time home alone.

Athena turned Arachne into a spider because the woman boasted about being a better weaver than Athena (but not before she challenged the mortal and lost)

Hera went after every woman that her husband had sex with and turned them into horrible creatures, banned them from giving birth on land, tricked Zeus into killing them, etc. Hell she went after  Zeus's bastards and tried to kill them as well even if they were babies. She wasn't a maternal figure either, when she gave birth to Hephaestus and saw how ugly he was she threw him off a mountain.

Demeter got so pissed when her daughter went missing that she stopped all crops on earth from growing (effectively starving humans to death). I can understand being pissed or distraught but humans played no part in her daughters disappearance.

While aphrodite was pregnant with Priapus, Hera used a potion on her that would make the baby be born hideous. When aphrodite saw how misshapen Priapus was she left him in the wilderness to die

15646,"The Power of Three showed that Amy and Rory did carve a full life for themselves in the 2010s without the Doctor. Rory had his dad, had a pretty good job going, they both were clearly very social and were shown having get-togethers, Amy had at least a couple of friends who she was close enough with to serve as the maid of honour at their wedding. Her parents were shown to be alive and around in the big bang as well. 

I do feel Rose got it a little *too* good though. She literally gets a ""permanent"" version of her doctor who grows old with her and a clone TARDIS. It's nothing too annoying but it just feels a little... idk... fanficcy to me?

And he showed he was aware of that when he left the first time in The God Complex. He tried to leave them to lead a normal life and be safe but he couldn't because they were too close to him and he couldn't bear to miss them. Was it selfish of him? Yes. But it's totally understandable. 

Plus there was also that whole divorce situation which made it seem to them as if Amy and Rory needed the Doctor as much as he thought he needed them. "

IMO, Leo was a far more significant character in the show than Mrs. Landingham, and his death far more dramatic. Hell, the scene in Season 6 where he has his heart attack was one of the saddest, most brutal scenes of the entire show. And to lose John Spencer himself in Season 7 was a kick in the balls."

And that’s *fine*. Star Wars has always been the contrast of fun space romp and “oh no” gut punches. “Into the garbage chute flyboy!” mixed with the burnt corpses of Luke’s aunt and uncle. But don’t for a second try to pretend its some grim dark mature, adult series. It’s not."

15684,"Not OP, but for me, my entire body ""shuts down"" and something like starvation mode kicks in. Namely, I won't feel hungry or thirsty and barely eat/drink anything for a few days -- especially if I'm traveling or not at home. Nothing for your body to digest, then nothing for it to get rid of.

I used to think this was great, because I go to a lot of conventions, and only needed to pee twice per day (when I woke up, when I went to bed) over the course of 4-5 days. In terms of moving to a new place, business #2 stops for ~3 days as I try to sort out my meal schedule. Shorter terms, I can leave the house all day and not notice if I've eaten or drunk anything (or intentionally not do so without any discomfort). But this not exactly healthy. So I've been forcing myself to eat/drink at regular internals when I'm out. Now I frequent public restrooms more often, albeit, I have to consume LOT more food and water than normal before needing one. Juice is another story...

One of the workers, I keep forgetting his name now, the large bearded guy, he was one of the homeless that was interviewed as I recall. 

Non death wise, the fall of Dukie and the loss of Randy to the system was incredibly hard to take"

15746,"Agree.  I watched the whole series a couple of times over when it was on TNT (ah, college).

The only thing that really bugs me about ER is that the writers seem determined to destroy *every single character*.  Doug and Carol were lucky to make it out alive -- nearly everyone else was utterly destroyed, repeatedly, on that show.  Mark Greene was the first, and possibly best, example of that.  There was that botched c-section, getting attacked in the hospital, the multiple brain tumors, the whole thing with his dad, his demon hobag of an ex-wife...it seemed like the writers just *hated* his character.  And don't even get me started on the whole Susan Lewis thing.  Can't Dr. Greene just have one thing?  *JUST ONE*.

And I will say that the show had definitely jumped the shark by the time helicopters swore their vendetta against Rocket Romano.  I suspect that the helicopters were somehow in league with RoboCop."

Gave a couple of my siblings a good jump scare that way. This really isn't as far fetched as it sounds. As kids do some pretty weird things &gt;.&gt; I would hope if it was truly a accident that innocent people didn't get locked up for it. Just because this age of trial by media is really depressing and one of the many reasons why I will never have kids. Not worth the risk of being locked up because of a single screw up.

don't wait for the ambulance just get to the hospital.""

15793,"Reminds me of when I was 12. Had the same thing happen to me, rumours of me being a lesbian but it went around the WHOLE school. Kids older than me that I didn't know were harassing me every day. This particular girl in one class was being especially mean. When the class finished she walked ahead of me and started saying nasty shit loud enough I could hear. So I walked up behind her and yanked her so hard by her ponytail her head snapped back quite roughly and I refused to let go for a good ten seconds. Completely silent rage. Pulled a good few hairs out when I finally let go. No regrets, but obviously I was the one that got punished. She never said anything after that however."
15794,"Honestly, I read the wikipedia page and I'm not immedietely sure what could be wrong with it if any. 

&gt;The case had strong media coverage because there were video recordings of the events and the commentaries on social networks.[1] The accused from Seville, including a member of the Civil Guard and another of the Spanish Army, were arrested and tried.[2] The judgment was announced on April 26 2018 with the court clearing the accused of rape, finding them guilty of sexual abuse instead. One of the three magistrates did not agree with his two colleagues and voted for their acquittal.[2]

...

&gt;In Spain, the crime of sex without consent has 2 legal categories, sexual aggression or sexual abuse. Sexual aggression is defined as necessitating violence (violencia) or intimidation (intimidación), sexual abuse is without violence, however there are controversies regarding the interpretation of these legal terms by the public;[10] ""intimidation"" is more narrow than abusing superiority or influence over the victim.[11]

Sounds right to me. I understand poeple can be mad about the sentence only being nine years but I will say two things:

1) nine years is long.

2) law's the law. Nulla poena sine lege.  "

16020,"Sure, if your only plan is to make a single sandwich. But agriculture, even for personal use is an economy of scale. You can raise enough chickens to fill a deep freezer for the same effort as raising one. If you're allowing the  birds to forage with only supplemental feed, you can even keep feed costs relatively low.(I know,  because I've done it) 

Same goes for gardening,  especially using more holistic approaches. No money for fertilizer, herbicides or insecticides that way. Start plants from seed instead of buying plants. (Again, been there, done that)

Most of the costs associated with these endeavors go toward infrastructure (coops, shovels, gloves, sharp knives, etc.). So as a one time thing, sure, it doesn't make any sense. But if you plan on growing your own food year after year,  then the initial investment starts to make a lot more sense because you generally end up saving more than your startup costs by buying less at the grocery store.

It sounds really superficial, but it's the little things that make a difference. It's the simplest way to tell your LGBT students that they are safe and accepted in your class."

16040,"NYS Child Support Help Line. There is literally no help to be found on that line unless you have a reading comprehension problem regarding the website. All the rules regulations and hoops you have to jump through are spelled out on the website and you can log into your account at any time to see what your balance is and whether or not you have payment coming for payments due. There is literally nothing that you could get on the helpline that you cannot get on the website.

So some poor custodial parent, or custodial grandparent in many cases, calls up because they're not getting their child support payments which come from the child support payment processing center, but before they come from the child support payment processing center they come from the non-custodial parent so if the non-custodial parent does not pay then the child support does not go out. Now these people who have the kids are wondering how they're going to feed them. It's even sadder with the custodial grandparents because they usually have two separate accounts one to collect from children's mother and one to collect from the children's father and they're calling up because neither of them has paid and they're on a pension. So people do a lot of asking you how you can sleep at night knowing that you're starving their children to death, crying, begging, and telling you they hope you would get hit by a bus.

On the other side of course you also get calls from non-custodial parents who genuinely cannot afford to pay the child support that they were assigned at the beginning because they've lost their job or if they've had a bad turn in their health or they went to jail for a while and did not immediately file for a change of order. If they don't file for the change of order the account keeps charging at the same rate and getting it changed retroactively is almost impossible. So sorry yes they've suspended your driver's license and I understand that you needed to get to the job that you need to keep in order to pay any of Child Support, and for that we have a form so that you can get a provisional license to drive to and from work only and no we can't have the child support from when you were sick or unemployed or whatever removed and yes they can seize your bank account if you're more than $2,000 behind and yes the same applies to your car if you own it and that's around when they start hoping that you get cancer, threatening suicide, saying lewd things about your mother, or announcing their plans to kill their ex and children.

Honestly it's a relief when someone just calls to get a check of their balance, or make sure we received or sent the check that we did in fact receive or send. I'm incredibly grateful that I no longer work there."

16044,"I had someone do this to me. It was a rural 80 zone, he was going in the range of 40-50 in his heavily modded Subaru (I think). As I pass him I hear him floor it, but I was already going about 100 and have a faster car so there was no chance. When he finally catches up he tailgates me at 120 for a few minutes to the next light. At the light I floor it because I know I'm faster and leave him in my dust. A couple minutes later he catches up again and we get an extra lane. He pulls up beside me and I know there is a common police radar hiding spot ahead so again I floor it but only for a second and slow back down, but he doesn't notice and just keeps going. He was easily going 50 over.  

It was a sad day because there was no police there that time. "

16051,"I’m not who you asked, but I’m a bisexual woman who is engaged to a heterosexual man. I’ve gotten this question before actually. For me, having a monogamous relationship with a man doesn’t mean I’m ignoring a part of myself. It’s the same thing as my fiancé not sleeping with other women anymore; it doesn’t mean he no longer finds other women attractive, his sexuality still exists. But we’re monogamous, so we don’t get involved with anyone else.  

It *does* bother me though that people assume that I’m “straight now”. Nope, still find men and women attractive, I just have found the one I want to be with and he happens to be a man. "
16052,"Fuck, all it takes is ""Sorry, we hired someone else."" *click*"
16053,"Yes. I was aware of the word bisexual, but I thought I couldn’t possibly be bi because I prefer monogamy. And I knew I couldn’t be a lesbian, because I had crushes on boys. But I also really liked girls. I just assumed that every girl liked girls and I was really straight."

Then the next day my music teacher made fun of how I moved on stage in front of another teacher I didn't know. Like, mocking me by imitating it and laughing with her friend at me while I was right there.

That was 15 years ago and I have never sung in front of anyone again. Even singing in a group makes me anxious and ashamed. Fucking bitch.

Up until then I'd had singing coaching for years and loved to sing, and I was dedicated to getting over my stage fright. All that was instantly dead in the water. I still love to sing but can't find my voice in front of others. I teach toddlers now though and sing to them :) "

I am a generally creative person, but when I try to sit down to be focused I have some level of pain or nausea and can't pay sustained attention without having to take another shit (or be constipated). Going to a cafe to write/edit is incredibly unsuccessful, as I end up leaving after less than an hour to sit on my own toilet instead of the public one.

For example, you were assigned female at birth, but you also mentioned that in middle school you wanted to look attractive for boys. Did that ever change? Or were you always a gay man? It would seem to me that if you identified as a man, than you would be attracted to women. I’ve also heard of men marrying women, for example. The woman not being aware until later, that their partner was trans and then this whole transition happens. Does that make the spouse homosexual if they stay with their now wife?

Turns out the video store had recently closed and we now had their number. At first I politely explained to callers we were an art gallery, but after five or six calls I just went with it. People called asking about all kinds of juicy titles, *Gutterballs*, *School Girl Report Vol. 5*, etc. We always had every title in stock and I made up that we had a delivery service. It made a lot of people very happy, and then, I imagine, very pissed. Never had any consequences. The gallery didn’t last long because we opened in 2008 during the recession (oops) and it turns out people don’t buy expensive art when they’re struggling to survive."

16206,"How to reach the social-developmental milestones I didn't get as a kid.

Like, I had a chaotic childhood and never went to the same school twice until high school.  My mother didn't model responsibility, just learned helplessness and some amazing lying skills.  I got super *smart*, because I had to figure things out quick or get beaten.  So I did really well on tests, and approx. 100% of the adults in my life said, ""You're so smart, now if you'd just *apply yourself*.""  Like, bitch, *applying myself* is the thing I never learned how to do!

My life was basically, ""Have fun until crisis; resolve crisis ASAP; go back to fun until next crisis.""  Delayed gratification never paid off for me as a kid and so I psychologically *couldn't* count on anything to ever pay off in the future - instant gratification was the only kind I ever got.  In my 20s, I found out that ""hard work"" is a skill and not just a choice, so I tried to develop that skill... but it didn't work, because I didn't have the ""willpower"" (i.e. *developed skill*) to set up and stick to the reward scheme I needed *to develop the skill*.

In grad school, it was to the point where I'd let a paper go all semester, start it on the due date, turn it in two days late, and still get an A.  I was studying *education*, ffs, and whenever I'd try to tell my PIs or advisors about my problem, they'd say, ""Look, I don't have time for this, you need to figure it out yourself.""  MFer, *my* developmental issue is affecting *your* bottom line, you are *teaching me* how to do this shit and bridge those dev gaps *for kids* - why can't I get the same treatment?  ""You need to have this sorted out already.""  Well, I *don't*, so how do I get help with it?  ""Not my problem.""

Ugh.  Sorry for rant.  But it's like, I understand the problem *so clearly*, and what I want *more than anything* rn is basically to go back to grade school, have a consistent reward scheme for easy tasks that gradually scaffolds up to intermittent/delayed rewards for increasingly complex tasks.  And that's the one goddamn thing I can't get.  *I need help and practice at structuring my life,* but I don't have the skills to give myself even the most basic structure to begin with.  😤"

They aren't actively encouraging it to happen, simply acknowledging that adolescents have raging hormones and will try things whether it's technically legal or not.  This just discourages an older adolescent from taking advantage of a younger one.

This system seems to be designed to separate the age ranges more or less by peer groups. The only one I personally would adjust is make 15 be 13-17 because 18 year olds are counted as adults and from the perspective of someone younger that can give them the appearance of authority. "

I also recently had to do the same sort of trick when a random dog tried to attack my dog, I basically saw the dog running and was able to intercept turn and get away quickly. I went home told my mum she went out to the people with the dog she 'knew' of them (Basically a group of homeless sorts who had a dog who was sort of known for issues) and they were like 'Aww we're sorry for scaring the little girl'

16301,"It was my first day out with friends at a bar in six months.  I had been avoiding things because of a series of anxiety and panic attacks I had suffered earlier that year.  I was on antidepressants and had finally gotten where I felt I could he around chaos and not freak out.

I'm nursing a drink while my girlfriend and a bunch of our friends are getting goofy and having a great time, when a guy two tables over throws a beer bottle that shatters on the ground all over my fried and his gf's feet.  My brain didnt turn on until I had picked the guy up and pulled him across his table, the entire place went silent.  It doesnt hurt that I am 6 feet, 4 inches tall and at the time was 240lbs. 

So, here I am, holding this douchlord up after dragging him across his table, in front of about 7 or 8 of his friends, and ask him why he threw a bottle at my friends girlfriend.  After stammering and babbling about how he didnt mean it I asked him if he wanted to apologize or if we were going to have to go for a walk.

The dude could barely speak at this point, but stammered out an apology and I asked him if he knew how fucked up it was to throw bottles at people and generally chastised him for his childish behavior.

No one said a word the entire time this was happening.  I shoved him back at his table, walked back to my friends, grabbed my drink and it was like in the movies where the music comes back on and our group went on like nothing had ever happened.   Best part? My gfs had never seen me get physical with anyone and had the biggest lady boner that we had to leave early.

I dont know if this counts as losing your shit, but I never get violent and was on medication that made me numb to most things for a few years of my life.

2 weeks later I find out that not only was she no longer interested with me, but had been increasingly interested in this other guy she works with. A friend from high school she hired
 That she previously had a crush on. That she was spending more and more time with. All while we were still together.

I lost my shit. 

Never had a fight in the 3 years we were together, she'd seen me annoyed at other things but NEVER pissed off. And never at her. I don't remember all that I said, I just went red. I was physically shaking, almost crying, yelling at her, and almost passed out. 

I moved all my stuff out that day (which just so happened to be 98% of the stuff in the apartment). I've been pretty much dead inside since."

 OPs ego is deflated because they're self concious about how their bjs might suck. They constantly lick themselves over this, and you are totally blowing my positive atmosphere.

Sweater jackets, pants, hoodies... all ridiculously small (I usually buy sweaters and hoodies in the men's section, because they're more comfortable and actually have space in their pockets).

 Also, the lyrics on Bass are funny. They imply she's thicc, but she's pretty much just has body fat like in her mid area and face. Not the kind of curves anyone likes. Her nose could put the wicked witch of the west to shame and notice in all of her videos she has so much make up on and extremely bright lighting? Still looks bad.

 At this point I'm being petty but she deserves it since Bass insults people and she's supposedly ""just playing"". The beats to her songs are good so if she comes up with them I give her props but I doubt she does. Her voice sounds really nasally too. Anyone you walk up to in the street could replace her in her songs and you wouldn't notice."

For example, the original may be for a full Orchestra, but you only have a string quartet and a piano. So somebody makes an arrangement for a smaller ensemble, and musicians pay to use that version rather than re-writing/transcribing the whole piece themselves to match their needs. "

Also, Rocket League is seriously pretty toxic. With the small teams, a lot of the time someone will blame anyone but themselves for losing. And in a lot of matches you get these guys leaving early. It's honestly the only game where community toxicity played a big part in me no longer playing it."

16357,"&gt; thumped


**PART I**

I was born into a family of non\-yeeters. Every morning before I went to school my father would say, ""if I ever find out that you've hit that yeet, I'll thump ya.""

""Yes, pa,"" I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing homework.

""Y'all hitting that *yeet?*"" he would seeth.

""No, pa,"" I would answer.

""Good."" He would then walk out the room and shout, ""If I ever catch ya, it's a thumpin'.""

It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin' that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake.

I would swallow my pride. ""No thanks. I don't wanna catch a thumpin' from pa."" As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in \- I would never hit that yeet.

One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin' that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air.

I breathed in.

""YEEEEE*EEEEE*EEEEET!""

My father burst from my closet. ""I told you I'd thump ya if I ever caught you hittin' that *yeet*, nibba,"" he screamed. Then, he thumped me.

I haven't hit that yeet since.

**PART II**

Until today. This morning was my father's funeral. At the procession, my brother asked me to say a few words. I told him I only needed one.

With confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone.

""Yeet,"" I spake.

Suddenly, my father leapt from his hand\-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest.

""Y'all hittin' that dirty fuckin' *yeet* at *my* funeral?"" he said. He raised his hand to thump me.

""Not so fast, pa."" I grabbed his hand. ""Yaint thumpin' no mo'.""

My father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle. ""The student becomes the teacher,"" he said.

""The student becomes the *yeet*cher,"" I corrected him."
16358,Must be an American school 
16359,"This and so much more.

Guys really don't understand that pretty much *every* woman they've had in their lives (SO's and friends and coworkers) has had something happen to them, whether it's something 'mild' like constant harassment, or more serious like abuse or assault.

I didn't make any friends in the time I was there. On my birthday, I slept in, took the metro downtown, walked around and got my free birthday shit at all the stores I could. Then I treated myself to a fancy dinner and took the leftovers home and ate the rest later before my mom was able to give me a call and say happy birthday. 

It felt really lonely at the time but by the end of the day I was actually happy that I got out of the house to treat myself and enjoy the day "

16389,"Can we do one about ourselves? I was in the military and the doctors there are known to... not be as efficient. It’s a bad reputation and I always appreciated them. But you do get that one every now and again. 

I came home (to Germany) from a trip in Bulgaria. Soon after I was getting stomach pains and diarrhea. I thought it would go away but the stomach pain worsen after a few days. It eventually felt like someone was reaching a hand into my stomach and squeezing. So I went to the ER since it was late at night in Landstuhl which was about 45 mins from home. The doctor didn’t do tests or anything, just said it was just from the plane food and told me if it gets worse in a couple days to come back. No meds, no home remedies, and I could barely stand. I went home and waited a few hours and went back knowing his shift was over and I’d get a new doctor. I told him what happened and that it feels like I have a bacterial infection. Sure enough, they tested a stool sample and gave me the proper drugs. I did have a bacterial infection. 

I was in Okinawa when I started getting these hives on my feet and hands. I went to the doctor and the corpsman took my symptoms down and took it to the Chief (who’s a PA, apparently). Without even seeing me at all, not even stepping foot in the same room as me, he diagnosed me for scabies based on her description and prescribed me Nix. I tell the corpsman it’s not bugs, it’s eczema or something like that. I needed something else other than bug cream. She didn’t care and I was sent home. Of course it worsens so I go to a different doctor and found out I have eczema. It just worsened because I was sweating a lot more while wearing leather gloves and leather boots. They gave me steroidal cream and it was gone in a few days. 

I hurt my shoulder in 2003, also while in Okinawa. For years I was going to the doctor telling them something is torn in there but they refused to do anything past an X-ray. As I got older, I would re-injure it quicker and the pain would last longer. So finally in 2012, a civilian orthopedic doctor contracted to the military hospital overheard my case while I went to medical yet again and he told me he would take me on. He performed an orthoscope and found I had a torn labrum from 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock. Pretty much from the front of my shoulder, down around my armpit, and coming up the back of my shoulder. He said there was years worth of scar tissue from constantly tearing and healing. "

The doc refused because he felt my reasoning wasn't valid. I had the Stemetil.. A few minutes later I had a severe allergic reaction and they had to quickly reverse the drug. He felt so guilty he apologized. 

Listen to your patients!! "
16393,"That's not masculinity.

Check any literature from times in which men needed to be though as nails. The Ancient times, for example. There's plenty of heroes. Masculine, strong, willing to fight and sacrifice themselves for what they love.

I finished my first year of spanish in spring, did my whole second year over the summer, and started third year spanish in the fall. I've been going to school year-round and because of that I will graduate in three instead of four years, which not only saves money directly but also indirectly via opportunity costs.

If somebody gives you oral sex then it's customary and nice to give them oral sex too. If you can't then there are other forms of foreplay yet the original statement seems to indicate that there was no foreplay.


Now instead of that woman being a princess, you instead dragged this towards a maybe she's been abused issue. If she has been abused and is currently not able to touch dick, then she simply shouldn't be having sex. Seems rather dickheaded of her to put someone else through a shitty sexual experience. "

But they must have done just the literal minimum of research beforehand, because what they got was the word ""gratis"", which does mean ""free"", but in the sense of something being ""free of charge"". I'm pretty sure that was not the intended meaning.

What made it more frustrating was that I was taking a Latin class at the time, owned a Latin-English dictionary, the person *knew all that*, and I could have told them the issue if they'd brought it up with me beforehand. "
16423,"I had a crush on him and he knew it, but   it was obvious he didn't like me back. One night, he got super drunk at the bar and all his friends had bailed. I took him home to make sure he didn't drive. 

When we got there, he sat in my car forever, got out, sat on the trunk and then got back into the passenger seat. He took his dick out and asked me to touch it. I felt like he was offering me a pity bone, or repaying me for driving him. I said no, because I didn't want it to happen like that. I wasn't driving him in hopes of getting laid, I did it to make sure he wouldn't kill himself or someone else. I also knew he didn't like me like that, and I didn't want him to do something he'd regret later and end up hating me for it. 

It was hard to turn down, with his dick in my face like that. I kept trying to convince myself maybe he really *did* like me or something. But I couldn't do it. Honestly, I was more impressed he could even get a boner at that point. He finally got out and I watched him walk inside, dick still poking out of his pants."

I have seen studies stating that biracial children are genetically healthier overall since they have a greater diversity of genetic alleles to inherit from- and this makes sense in an evolutionary context. 

So the net result is that it's obvious you're scared of races mixing and that confirmation bias has led you to fixate on the difficulties of it rather than the strengths, and then ask leading questions on the internet about it to make your views clear.

16448,"The vagina *does* clean itself. Soap is not good for it. 

If there’s a bad smell, it means she has bacterial vaginosis or some other kind of medical issue (that is likely benign and not caused by her doing something unhygienic, but can cause bad smell/extra discharge, etc). The vagina has an extremely delicate ph balance; it doesn’t take much to send it out of whack, and unfortunately a lot of people (including women) are not well educated on it.

when she was 21 (when i met her) she looked 10. It didn't help that it was a halloween costume of a 'sexy' meowth from pokemon. I sat there as she grinded on a dude going 'wtf? where tf are her parents?'

i was new to this crowd so the fact that she was so accepted and didn't even get carded by the barkeep made me think i was taking crazy pills.

ANYWHO....i got to know her and i found out she was almost perpetually single with guys and mostly dated girls because whenever she had any sort of PDA with dudes in public they would get harassed/beaten/stuff thrown at them. Meanwhile with girls they would give weird/dirty looks but not actually do anything.

Shes almost 30 now and recently said she was going to have a shirt made that states ""no, i am not a child, my growth was stunted"""
16451,"If we're all truly being honest with one another -- Cosby clearly thought he was bulletproof.  He most likely thought that any crime he committed was a case of he-said/she-said, and he thought that the ""he"" being BILL COSBY, and Bill Cosby being America's Favorite Dad, he was safe from prosecution.  He probably also thought that crimes committed in the 70s, 80s and 90s would never need be explained, and certainly wouldn't result in any kind of criminal record.  He thought anything that happened outside of his own home would shield his family from scorn, and were a perk of the lifestyle and career he led.  And consciously or not, he may have decided that making public statements about How To Be A Good Black was a way to deflect criticism of his sexual proclivities.

Bill Cosby was wrong about a whole lot of things."

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

One issue is proper nutrition while young, another issue is lack of attention to fitness, then there is clothes, haircuts and also shaving that weird looking mustache off the upper lip when guys start growing facial hair.

But I also do know the psychological issues it could cause..I'm not sure if those cases are issues with bad parenting or just something that could happen when you have a parent that tries to control too much..

I'd also get turned down for invitations to things and I always thought they were lazy or stingy and that wasn't the case they just didn't want to be friends with me.

I had three of my four grandparents suffer with varying degrees of dementia in their final months/years of life. My Grandad in particular spent the last several years of his life suffering with Alzheimer’s, and naturally, we suffered with him. We loved him deeply, and still do. Having a first-hand experience with someone suffering from such an illness makes you think you understand it, but then that scene cropped up as I binged through season 4. That reveal of Henrietta, her ‘face’ just a giant scribble, made me understand the situation with my grandad so much more than I ever did before. It was a feeling of shock, sadness, and yet also relation; as it felt as though somebody understood it, and that you’re not alone in being someone who has had a second-hand experience with dementia.

Also, like someone else in the comments had mentioned, it’s possible that this was some kind of fetish thing.

16760,"This one doesn't get much publicity, but, the [Robison Family Murders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robison_family_murders).

They're believed to have occurred on June 25, 1968, in this middle-of-nowhere little village in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, Good Hart.

A family of six from downstate was murdered at their summer cottage: Richard Robison, his wife Shirley, and their four children; Ritchie, 19; Gary, 16; Randy, 12; and Susan,7.

They were discovered in their secluded cottage in the woods near Lake Michigan when not-particularly-nearby neighbors started noticing the smell, almost a month after the murders. A caretaker peeked in the window and called police. They were met with a ""wall of flies.""

It appears the murders started with someone shooting the Dad and possibly the middle brother from outside through the window. The killer then entered, shot the mother and young daughter as she tried to hide, and the oldest and youngest boy as they tried to hide or escape from a bedroom. Each family member was then shot in the head. 

The father and mother were also bludgeoned with a hammer, and the mother was splayed out in a way that could have meant she was sexually assaulted, though the decomposition of the bodies and the limited forensic capabilities at the time make that uncertain.

No one was ever charged, but police over the years have come to the conclusion it was a business partner of the father's, who had recently been caught by the father embezzling from him. Police claim the business partner owned the same types of guns used. That partner ultimately committed suicide, and in his suicide note, swore he didn't do the murders.

I've never bought it was the partner.

If you're covering up an embezzling crime, maybe you murder the Dad. Why murder the whole family? Why the 7-year-old girl?

The crime showed rage and depravity. And for the business partner to have done it, he would have had to drive up there from downstate - about 5 hours - maintaining that rage.

Then there's this weird wrinkle: A wire service reported shortly after the bodies were found that a woman told police she saw a man she thought was John Norman Collins and another man riding motorcycles Up North in the area around the time the Robisons were murdered.

Collins is serving life in prison now for the serial murders of coeds in Southeast Michigan in the late '60s. The book ""The Michigan Murders"" is about his exploits. And what did Collins do to his female victims? After raping them, he bludgeoned their heads into Oblivion -- much like how Mrs. Robison ended up.

At the end of season 2 right when Angel gets his soul back but she still has to kill him.  He's been evil this whole time and all of a sudden says Buffy.  They have a moment and then she drives him through with the sword.  Yikes.

Then the end of season 4, the gift.  That conversation with her and Dawn when she realizes she has to jump.

16797,"It's almost completely responsible for the current state of the Korean film industry.

I think people from the US especially don't get why it was such a big deal. They watch it and just see a sort of mediocre action movie like any other. And that's exactly the point. It's not important because it was *good*, it's because Korea had made a domestic film that was up to the same standards as Hollywood. When it then was hugely successful it showed investors that putting that kind of money behind a Korean-made film would yield a solid return. In response you saw a massive increase in funding to the point that Korea now has a thriving film scene. Hong Kong has lagged since the '90s, at least on the international market, but Korea has readily taken up that slack.

Besides, *Shiri* has Choi Min-Sik in it!"

16800,The one I've never rewatched is Xander and Anya's wedding. I felt like Whedon just pulled the rug out form under everyone for no reason. Like he had to make sure every romantic relationship in the series ended up a trainwreck or kill somebody off if it didn't. And it didn't matter how much he had to regress characters to do it. It makes me almost as mad as the HIMYM ending.

16803,"Are you concerned for me? Or just wanting to vent about how you think my emotions are out of control? I cry because my hormones are all over the place at stupid things a couple of days out of the month, this honestly isn’t a rare occurrence for a lot of women. Men too, regardless of hormones. It’s very normal.

Periods *are* difficult, unless there’s some magical HRT I can take then there isn’t much to do about this other than what I do already. I cried once because Hogwarts isn’t real...that’s a big difference from allowing my emotions to govern my behaviour in some sort of dramatic fashion.  It’s hardly like I go out in public and start waving an axe around due to my crazy-woman time. I still function as a normal member of society.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I’m going to disregard it. I’ve had plenty of therapy and have learned a lot of techniques, I’m doing fine. I don’t have angry outbursts if that’s what you’re assuming. I lose my temper a mundanely normal amount and it isn’t usually period-related.  

Edit: just want to add that this guy has edited his comments a fair amount and it isn’t quite the vitriol it once was. I appreciate that, but because I’m not changing mine it doesn’t flow the same as it did. For anyone confused, initially he was calling me unstable and ordering me to spill my innermost to a therapist, ~~now it’s his sister who went? I’ll admit I’m confused,~~ (more ninja edits, I can’t keep up). Anyway, seems like he’s bummed about his sisters behaviour who genuinely appears to be suffering from some sort of hormonal disorder, hope she gets help dude.

For that second part of the all caps, do NOT stick your feet out the window while driving.

It peaked there though. The story was enjoyable and they kept up with a lot of the lore/references, but episode 2 was a bit punishing mechanically without being as interesting story-wise for the first half, and the later episodes went to a much more linear ""solve this series of puzzles"" formula.

Before her I only dated one other girl and that was just a couple of months during my summer after my last year of high school.  So I wasn't having girls falling all over myself either.  The first marriage was about 8 years.  After that divorce I had back to back relationships with pretty much anyone that would reply to my messages.  Pretty much each of them would last a couple of months and then one of us would end it and move on.  Then when I tried to stop that cycle, I ended up meeting someone, actually here through Reddit.  She and I were married for just about 2 years when she wanted to end it. (she is 13 years younger and I feel that some health issues I was having at the time, scared her away.)

So, Take your time.  Even if they aren't noticing you now, they will later and you still have a chance at getting divorced a couple of time yourself.

Many people even double down and say they would have the same reaction with a straight couple (99% of the time they don't) It's subtle homophobia.

17076,"Yep, it's a relic of the past and is fading out, but not quickly enough. When the pride parades started, all homosexuals were viewed as sexual deviants and sinners. Horrible names were thrown at them regularly. And when gay people were not able to gradually integrate into society, some people went with the door-in-the-face method over the foot-in-the-door. ""*You think I'm a pervert? I'll show you a pervert! Try to ignore me now!*"" They wanted to be noticed. And they were.

Nowadays, we don't have to be shocking to be acknowledged. So we should stop sending this false message of what it means to be gay. A lot of gay pride parades are moving towards being just family-friendly events where anyone (gay, straight, whatever) can come and feel love and acceptance."

Never more than an hour, maybe 2 tops. At first no appointment, then you'd get an appointment but they were like a week or two out. If you had an appointment it would be like 30 minutes tops.  

From what I've heard, it's gotten really really bad in the last few years. I'm not sure what caused it, but it's a new phenomenon. I bought a trailer recently and to register it and the appointment was 3 weeks out. Which is a little crazy to me.

This is in NorCal.

But from knowing a few people that worked there and working once upon a time in government. It doesn't have to be that way. There's really not a lot going on, and the processes could easily be streamlined but there's no incentive for that to be done, and they won't hire someone to properly fix the situation by taking a holistic look at the whole deal and spending some cash now to save a ton later."

17124,"After a lot of soul searching, I've found that that's what my hobby *is*.

My hobby is trying new things. 

People always want you to specialize. Find one thing and get stupidly good at it. On the contrary, I pride myself on the fact that I'm a jack of all trades. 

I can weld. I can code. I design electronics. I can build an engine. I can do plumbing. I'm an ametuer astronomer. I play and design video games. I can fix and recharge an air conditioner. I do woodwork. I can play the piano. And so many other things. 

All of these things were found through various hobbies that I picked up for a while and dropped later. Eventually I may go back to them as my interest goes back up, but I can drop them again just as quickly. The important thing is that I filed away the skill in my toolbox for use later.

I was also lucky to find a job that uses various skills all the time, in facility management. One day I might be lost in spreadsheet hell, one day i might be under a desk tracing an electrical issue, one day I might be on a 12-story roof diagnosing a dry cooler. 

That's not to say l love my job by any means, but I don't mind it either. Some people's job is their life's work, but for some people, their job is just the *means* to achieve their life's work. And my life's work is to learn about as many different topics as I possibly can. 

The second part of that famous phrase is always forgotten about, but it's the most important:

So I call the number, and am informed that customer service is currently *only* helping customers who are physically at a theater and having problems with ticketing, and all other issues will have to be addressed at some indefinite point in the future when they have time. Call back later.

I follow this rule 90% of the time.

Like once or twice a month I'll work overtime and not get out until 3am.  On the way home I'll grab like a cheesburger and coke from McDonalds, throw on my PJs, and just eat it in bed.  Is it healthy?  No.  Is it neat?  No?  But on nights like that, fuck it.

I can't lie it's super comfortable feeling too.  Finally laying down after a 12 hour shift, junk food, soda, comfortable pajamas, don't have to worry about getting up again until morning....

Pro tip: never add softener when you wash towels, and if you dry them in a dryer don't add any dryer sheets. That stuff basically waxes your clothes and makes towels much less absorbent.

The whole point of joining a hobby is that you don't have to awkwardly sit down and chat with a group, but rather that you have to sit down with a stranger and play a game of chess/ask about their art project/etc.

And no, that doesn't mean you play one game of chess and suddenly found your new best friend, but if you play a game of chess with that guy every week for a few months, he easily moves from ""stranger"" to ""acquaintance"", after which point staying and talking about the game afterwards becomes the new normal. And then next time you invite a few of your chess acquaintances over for drinks &amp; games, and before you know it they're your buddies and it's not weird to invite them for other stuff as well.

The kid also  saw my face and got a head start, but I chased that little fucker into the hall, around the gym, back in the gym and I dove at him when I was close enough. I pummeled the shit out of him, in the face and properly until the coach pulled me off of him. He was beaten but didn't go to the hospital or anything. I think I got 2 days of in school suspension.

Don’t get me wrong though I served six years in the navy, and my dad taught me and my brothers to stand up for the weaker person especially because my one and only sister was born with Down Syndrome. 

One afternoon I was walking around my High School, after I was done helping tutor Algebra 1. I was walking to my car when I saw this one much larger kid picking on this other kid that I knew has Autism. As soon as I saw the bully put his fingers in the of the other kid I knew I had to step in. I was just about to yell out to the bully to leave the kid alone and come pick on me when it happened. I saw the bully smack the kids head up against the brick wall and the kid fell to his knees crying. 

I absolutely lost it, I snatched that bully up by the back of the shirt and started wailing on him. I stomped him in his face and kept on asking him if it was still funny to pick on the handicapped. I don’t remember how long the beating lasted or when my buddies pulled me off of him. But I feel like he got what he deserved.

The next day I was pulled into the principals office where I had a meeting with the special needs boys parents. They thanked me and told me that he was having a problem with bullies, and I told them not anymore because I would be looking out for their son. I did end up getting suspended for three day only because of the school fighting policy. I saw the bully a few weeks later at school and he had his jaw wired shut. "

I was in college when we met, and I'm fiercely independent and also absolutely in love with my field of work, so when I was at my computer, I told him I need to be left alone. I guess he didn't believe me because he would try to initiate sexy time while I was focused on work which of Course led to me telling him to leave me alone and peeling his hands off me while I try to maintain my focus. Then he started saying ""oh sorry I was joking"" and I told him not to call them jokes, just say ""oh I didn't realize you werent in the mood"" because If he calls them jokes then I can't tell when he's being serious or not, and then it seems like he's interrupting my study time for ""shits and giggles"". But his jokes Aren't jokes - how is it a joke to try to cuddle your partner while she's doing homework and then when you're rejected, its a joke?   


But the thing is, he has always been a quick fire. That wasn't on me. He's been that way from the beginning, and I remember skipping foreplay time because if we did too much foreplay, he would fire off within a couple minutes after penetration. but foreplay is my favorite part and what I need to become aroused, because I was in a sexually abusive relationship so now I need to feel like I can trust my partner before giving into intimacy.

17300,"Well, story time!


So I was at the box office. Dad comes to buy tix and was carrying child. Our instructions were to check every child to see if they are over the height limit at box office and at entry point (usher stand). There’s a cutely designed stand with measurements at both places. 


When it’s a baby, we don’t check. But for toddlers, we ask the parents to place the child in front of the measuring stand for verification before allowing entry.


So box office, dad, child in arms. I politely ask dad to place child, dad grumbles and play child. Child is about 4cm above height limit. I replied that his child would need a ticket. Dad protests and says the child’s shoes (soles) were thick and removes the shoes for remeasuring. Still about 2cm above limit. 


At this point I would be happy to just let it go and let dad purchase his tix alone, but I’m sure the ushers will check and deny entry.


Before I could say anything, dad starts pushing down on child’s head to get him below the height limit. Child has no idea what is going on cos he’s like 3, maybe 4. Child starts crying. I ask dad to stop doing that, dad keeps pushing down. He was hurting his child to save $11!


I started seeing red, firmly told dad I won’t be charging a tix for the child. At this point I can only guess why dad decided to shout at me. Maybe he misheard, maybe he just wanted to win an argument. Hurled profanities at me, threw a big ass swirly lollipop (the candy was about the size of my face) at me. Grabbed me over the counter.


I punched him (first time punching someone), called security and got him out.

17389,"I was diagnosed with a rare form of Leukaemia in February 2018. A healthy and fit 26 year old female with no prior medical history. Unfortunately, they don’t know what causes my type of Leukaemia so it was really luck of the draw.

I was sick with a cold for about before diagnosis and I had one day off work. I didn’t think there was any point going to the doctor being I just had a shitty cold. Other things started to develop that I just assumed were because I’d come home from Christmas holidays and was a bit run down. Over time, I slowly lost my appetite, became increasingly fatigued, sweating all day and night, a really heavy period, loss of concentration, nose bleeds at night and a faint rash appeared on my chest and legs. 

Eventually, I went to the doctor one morning during work because i had unrelenting nose bleed. The doctor knew straight away that something was very wrong and I was sent to straight to ER and didn’t leave hospital for 5.5 weeks while I received my first round of chemo. I never went home to back a bag or collect my belongings.

Since then I’ve had a stem cell transplant and finally on the road to recovery. However, the doctor I went to on the 14 February 2018 saved my life. I’m not sure how much time I would have had left had if he hadn’t picked it up straight away or if I hadn’t bothered to go. "

The jist is basically that there's a limited number of people that our brains can *conceptualize* as ""people"". The larger the ape brain in question, the more people they can simultaneously process.

But once it reaches a certain point, the people outside of the monkeysphere become 2D caricatures. Influenced by media, gossip, personal beliefs projected, etc. Like shadows on a cave wall, not at all providing a true representation of that person.

This is why fans of some celebrities just *completely* lose their shit and go hysterical on coming face-to-face with them. They've idolized them to the point that their caricature, outside of that persons monkeysphere, becomes almost god-like. And that image has just appeared in front of them in the flesh.

But, just by hanging out with that person for a while, that celebrity starts to enter the brains monkeysphere. And the person discovers they're just another person. That they have likes, dislikes, favourite foods, nervous tics or habbits that are really annoying.

The only reason they WOULDN'T do one is... I don't know, a giant storm destroys their studio or something. Otherwise there was no point in buying the IP.

After being really good friends for a couple months, I only fell for her more, so I thought the only fair thing would be to talk to her about it so there isn't this awkwardness between us that she doesn't understand. Well, turns out I ended up being that 1%, and she liked me too. We started dating, and for awhile it was kind of like you describe. She was kind of distant, anytime I would hug her or sit close to her she would be kind of awkward about it, and it never really felt like she wanted me, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I talked to her about it. And we've had a lot of conversations about it, and for her it was just hard identifying her sexuality and figuring out what she wanted and just kind of testing the waters. I don't know if it was a conscious decision or not, but she did get more affectionate after we talked, and after being together for awhile and having a lot of conversations about it, I know that she wants to be with me.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to say with this is, you should really just talk to her. Voice your concerns (maybe not as harsh as ""just tell me already because I'm dying here"") and let her know how you feel. There's a chance it's all paranoia. She might be going through some stuff and pulling away from you is subconscious and a result of that, and she hasn't even realized what she's doing. Be sure to let her know that you do love her, so she knows your concerns are coming from a good place, but give her a chance to explain herself."
17630,"This has been disproved by several studies, unfortunately.

The microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract has actually been found to start prenatally. There are several studies supporting this, whereas they have found bacteria in placentas, umbilical cords, amniotic fluid, and in the meconium. The meconium (first feces), earlier believed to be completely sterile, has actually shown to harbor a more complex community of bacteria.

A study analyzing meconium and children at 3 weeks​

[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066986](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066986)

Quote from the artcile of Moles, L. et al;

""Bacilli and other Firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while Proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples"".

The more we study the gut microbiota, the more complex it reveals itself to be, an exciting Field of study.

&amp;#x200B;

Another possible example on the colonization of the GI tract, making the meconium not sterile;   
An increase of E. coli has been detected in the perineum and vagina under pregnancy, making a transfer route from the E. coli to the newborns mouth (studies have found high amounts of E. coli in the newborns oral cavity after birth). In addition, the gastric acid production of the newborn are low, making it possible for E. coli to enter and start colonizing the GI tract. 

Edit: Some grammar, and an example of E. coli colonization"

**TL;DR:** we celebrate birthdays, but humbly and we celebrate and thank God for the good things in life everyday  

sorry for the long read, but I like sharing about my religion :)

EDIT: it's actually considered bad to celebrate holidays that are based around other religions, such as Christmas or Deepavali. but hey, at least we get some days off from school or work."

When I was looking for the Nissan Rogue Uber paired me up with to take me to that appointment, I could not contact the driver or see the vehicle.  I ended up trespassing and getting in and out of various vehicles at a fire station, one of them being a Nissan.

​

The firefighters said that I was acting confused and drunk, and that based on my headache and neck pain I should go to the hospital. They used their ambulance and got me to the local hospital.

​

At the hospital, the staff took a CT scan and MRI, and then an angiogram before determining I had a hemorrhaging tumor on my brain.  8 hours of surgery to remove it occurred the next day.   Turns out it was a metastatic Melanoma that I had unknowingly had for several months.  Melanoma is extremely rare in Asians, I stay out of the sun, and they don't know what part of my skin/mucous membranes was the starting location.

My fight isn't over though.  I have sporadic cancer on my brain/blood membrane(Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis).  I have just about finished radiation treatment on my whole brain.  That, in combination with immunotherapy, will hopefully get rid of my Melanoma issue.  This limbo period where I don't know whether the treatment is working or I'm a dead man walking is the worst.

17740,"This may be a difficult story to tell because of client confidentiality and trade specific words, but I’ll do my best. 

TLDR: asshole project manager threw my bf (and co-worker) under the bus. I ran a semi-truck over the project manager. 

My bf and I (now husband) worked together at an environmental consulting company. Our jobs were to collect data in the field and bring it back to the office for the scientists and engineers to evaluate. One of the major clients was a big oil company with big health and safety (H&amp;S)rules to follow. This is a good thing - anything that keeps the people working outside safe is helpful. However, the project managers (PMs) had H&amp;S quotas to meet and report back to the client. 

The PM on this specific project was an asshole. He thought he was better than the people doing the hard work out in the field and didn’t respect the field techs. Anytime he made a mistake, he blamed it on the data collection, meaning us. He hated my bf in particular and I still don’t understand why. 

When a homeless person broke into a remediation system, the PM blamed my bf even though the homeless population had been a issue for a long time but the PM didn’t want to ask the client for more money fore security. My bf had to go through an incident investigation even though he had nothing to do with it, other than his name being the last listed visitor. The PM assumed my bf forgot to lock up the compound rather than report the ongoing homeless issue that he couldn’t control. 

A couple months later, I was tasked to visit the site and had revenge on my mind. I cut the lock to the compound and called the PM to report another breaking and entering without saying that the lock was cut. The PM asked me to go inside and check the log book to see who was the last person there, assuming they didn’t secure the lock once again. I opened the log book - looks like the PM was the last one there! Oh my! Did he forget to lock up! How could he do that!  Did he need me to sit in on the incident investigation?

Amazingly a security system was installed the next week and the homeless security concern was fully addressed with the client. They took the incident off my bf’s record and identified the site as high risk due to the security issue. 

The PM probably knew what I did, although he never let on. Lesson learned - don’t mess with the people you rely on for information. "

Namely, what we are doing, if it’s non standard (eg diverting, etc). I think there was only one time where we had something REALLY go wrong (smoke in the cockpit), and just told the flight attendant to take care of the passengers (we had a lot on our plates). She was phenomenal. She kept everyone calm, told them we were diverting.  When we got on the ground safely, THEN she informed the passengers what was wrong. When we deplaned everyone was happy, thankful, and in a good mood even though they were in the wrong city.

17769,"Didn't even realize this was a thing. Yet another example of corporations totally fucking over the middle class in this backwards corporate fascist country. 

&gt; Yet, the law gives mineral estate owners and lessees significant authority to remove minerals. When the mineral estate is severed, the mineral estate is dominant, absent contrary language in deeds. The mineral estate has an implied easement to use the surface in any way that is reasonably necessary for the exploration, drilling, production, transportation and marketing of minerals. With that comes the right to choose locations, construct roads or other necessary infrastructure, to cut down trees, and to use groundwater.

&gt; What does that mean for landowners’ claims? It means that unless the operator conducts operations in an unreasonable or negligent manner, or in violation of statutes or leases, the operator can do whatever he needs to extract oil and gas, no matter how much of a nuisance it may cause to surface owners. But there are limits to these rights, so it is necessary to explore boundaries.

&gt; First and foremost, a mineral lessee must use the surface reasonably. Excessive use of the mineral estate that goes beyond this implied easement could give rise to a cause of action in trespass or nuisance. The focus of the court’s analysis will be on whether the offending use is “reasonably necessary” to develop the minerals.

&gt; This is a broad standard, and it is rare for a court to find that a lessee’s activity was unreasonable. Don’t build more roads than are needed. Don’t take up more land surface, or extract more groundwater than what reasonably can be used.

&gt; Courts seem reluctant to find a nuisance caused by noise, odors or light. According to an early Texas case, if a person purchases “premises burdened with the terms of a mineral lease, he is in no position to complain of conditions produced. (The landowner) is further presumed to have known that conditions would arise naturally during the drilling of said well that would make using the premises as a home disagreeable, inconvenient and perhaps dangerous.”

&gt; In short, the surface owner should know what he is in for when buying property subject to a severed mineral estate. Drilling is not considered a nuisance per se. Without proof of negligence, breach of contract, or breach of statutory duty, surface owners have a difficult time winning a nuisance claim.

Example of owners being kept in the dark about not having mineral rights:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fracking-rights-specialreport/special-report-u-s-builders-hoard-mineral-rights-under-new-homes-idUSBRE9980AZ20131009

Really, I wouldn't care so much about not being able to profit from the minerals under the property as I would be sent into a raging shitfit about my property being utterly destroyed by mining/extracting operations. Fracking that will contaminate ground water supply, potentially drilling a deeper well and lower the groundwater table below where my well reaches, the noise and light pollution, and destruction of property value. Holy fuck. This hasn't even affected me and I want to fucking lose my mind over it."

*The End of Time* is actually a pretty conventional Doctor Who story. There's a problem, The Doctor solves it, everything is wrapped up at the end. It's easy to forget the prophecy from earlier so when you realise that *this* is the moment it's a very sudden tone shift.

17856,"My mum is an obsessive google-er whenever I get sick or injured. Usually, she's pretty on the ball with her ""diagnosis"" but one case sticks out.

I have a bone condition, called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, that makes my bones break much easier than normal. I'm up to 15 or something breaks, and I'm only 17. Anyway, one day I've injured my wrist, and I've had xrays done, and the doctors couldn't find a break, so they sent me home with nothing. No brace, bandage, or even pain relief. I was in excruciating pain, and was really confused as to how it wasn't broken. If it wasn't broken, there was something seriously wrong, because that shit wasn't right.

Having my history, most doctors kinda believe me when I say I know something isn't right, but not this time. So we take a xrays home, and my mum is looking at them and says ""look, I'm no expert, but that there doesn't seem right..."" and points to a moderately sized ""bump"" on my bone. She tells me to go to sleep, and we'll head back to the hospital in the morning. So I dose up on painkillers, and pass out until the next day.

We get a new doctor to review the xray, and mum points out the ""weird spot."" Obviously some time the previous night, she had gotten onto the internet, and says ""I'm pretty sure she's got an undisplaced buckle fracture, on her distal radius"" Doctor smiles condescendingly, leaves, and gets some radiologist friends to check it with him.

I never saw that doctor again, but another doctor came in, pointed to the weird bump on the xray, and said:

""So it looks like you've got an undisplaced buckle fracture of the distal radius. Let's go get a cast on that!""

In my personal case, the second item was a change of position/employer. It was a chance to make a fresh start and reset expectations on work/life boundaries. The key is setting the expectation up front and sticking to your guns. Once you get known as someone who is going to put in extra effort after hours, it becomes an expectation. 

I learned a hard/late life lesson: Your employer has zero loyalty to you. If push comes to shove, they are going to take care of their interests first. You have to realize this and apply the same to your own interests. Nobody is going to look out for you, except for you. "

If you were in front of him providing draft and happened to look back you'd get an eyeful of that hog of his just flopping from one side of the protruding part of a bike seat to the other with every pedal pump.  Just back and forth, mezmerizing really, but you can't think about that when you're busy carving up the asphalt.  

Anyway, ol' slick dick says, ""Hey liners! (that was what we called each other for short) Remember before when we couldn't race those loosepant-BK-dickheads because there was a little sand on the road and we had to walk our bikes back?"" 

And we're all like yeah no shit that was 49 minutes ago (Ladyboy Lou is a bit of a stickler for exactitudes).  

""Well why don't we get bikes with wider tires and more traction so we carve up the sand?""

There was obviously instant outrage with everyone berating him saying things like, ""oh I bet you want shocks too you heavy bike-having piece of shit!"" or ""Next you'll want to grow a beard and go down a fuckin mountain you goddamn hillbilly"".  Then someone suggested making him give back his live strong bracelet cock ring and that's when I knew Streamline had lost a member.  

It wasn't all bad because we then got to go out recruiting young hairless boys with no upper-body and thick thighs.. haha good times man, good times... STREAMLINE!

17921,"No, I'm inferring it based on the text of the book. There is really nothing in the text (other than the general bleakness of the book) that suggests the man who finds him is a bad guy and plenty to suggest that he isn't."
17922,That's hardly historically accurate though. I mean don't people want a degree of verisimilitude? It hardly gives an idea of what a battle was really like if you have a crowd of people cheering along. 
17923,"Yeah, there’s something about their eyes. They can act normal and people often love their normal persona, but they have no soul in their eyes and sometimes it slips out. It’s the best way I can explain it. "
17924,"Sometimes, being friends is nice. Things don't have to be awkward or change forever."
17925,I have face blindness and won't remember you. I also tend to sound like I'm angry and yelling at you but I'm not actually angry at you. 
17926,"Look to see if they put a divider on the belt to make sure I don’t ring up someone else’s groceries with theirs 

Edit: cleaned it up"
17927,It's a rule in my house too. Towels hang on the back of the door and no one wants to fish them out of the toilet if they fall in

17930,"The sense of moral outrage.  I think it's silly how so many get worked up over a (news) story and talking like they have the answer to problem X.  Guess what, sports fans, the world is not that black &amp; white or easy to solve."
17931,"Memphis isn’t even that bad. Just don’t get caught up in the hood and you’ll be straight. I knew somebody was gonna say this green shit, lol. "
17932,"Most craft beer drinkers like them the best, so they're the most popular. All the bullshit about ""It's the easiest to brew"", ""You can brew crap and people will love it because of hops"" is just that. Bullshit. They're the most popular, because that's what people buy the most of.

I didn't like beer until I had my first IPA probably 15 years ago. After that, I've tried every style of beer you can imagine, many times over. IPA's are still my favorite by a mile. Yes, some are bad. Some of the most highly regarded brews, I don't care for. But, they're #1 for a reason."
17933,"I would've said 2009-2012, when they were already an established form of communication on the internet. That's just my opinion though."
17934,"Relative to the total population, access to food *everywhere* is actually in the best place it has ever been, and it's getting better.

And it gets better yet: the number of people  suffering chronic undernourishment is now falling dramatically not just in relative terms, but in *absolute* terms. In 1990, there were about 1.1 billion people (out of about 5.4 billion) suffering chronic undernourishment. There are now fewer than 800 million, out of a population of about 7.6 billion. The rate at which we expand food production is outstripping our population growth.

And just to top it off, the rate of population growth worldwide is in decline. By 2100, we'll probably be pretty much stable, probably somewhere between 9.5 and 13 billion people. So not only are things getting better: they're also becoming increasingly sustainable.

We're not in a golden age yet, but we're approaching it and can expect to reach it by the end of the century, or the early years of the next century at the latest. There are people alive now who will live to see a world without widespread hunger. And once we get there, there's a decent chance that the golden age will never, ever end."

17940,"No, I didn't. I don't really need a reason to break up with someone, but he scared the living shit out of me and put my life in danger. I absolutely think that's a valid reason to dump someone. It's pretty cavalier to just say ""well, besides endangering the lives of his passengers..."". "

17942,"I had dreadlocks at the time. I'm mixed race, half Jamaican on my dad's side, but very white looking. Manager asked me what the deal with my hair was, then mimed smoking a joint, and asked me if I smoked a lot of weed.

I told him no, I'm half Jamaican, half black, and proud of my heritage."
