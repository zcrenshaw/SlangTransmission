7,"Error.

Man has inalienable rights as a natural right that have not derivation form the constitution.   One of the opposing arguments against the bill of rights was the fear that codifying them in ink and constitution would allow the government an avenue by which to deprive man of these rights."

27,"The long standing practice of pasteurising milk is not due to health concerns with raw milk, but because it lets dairy farmers feed their cows crap (industrial farming) and blast them full of antibiotics (big pharma). In fact, raw milk is actually SAFER to drink than pasteurised milk (so long as the cow as healthy), the microorganisms in raw milk will attack pathogens that would cause us harm. In pasteurised milk, you kill off all pathogens found in the milk, but you kill the bacteria that would kill the pathogens as well, so if it were to be exposed to any new pathogen, it would thrive without anything keeping it in check. The microorganisms in milk are designed to keep it healthy enough for babies (with an extremely weak immune system) to eat, not designed so that it's a dice roll any time you need to nourish yourself.

52,"&gt;(once you get past all of the ""for show"" treating people shitty).

I think it's less ""for the show"" and more ""he's one of those people that really go off when they get pissed"". Like, I totally believe that he talks like that in real life when he gets real angry."
53,"Most of John Wayne (the most American American of all time) 's biggest movies were literal Westernizations of Japanese Samurai movies; The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, literal direct copy; the first Star Wars movies are remakes of a couple of Akira Kurosawa movies; Desperado with Antonio Banderas is Hollywood paying the original director to remake his own movie. 
They've been doing it for decades. "
54,"Double-standards much?

&gt;time travel, don't want to cause any paradoxes or break the universe

An RTD finale literally featured a machine called ""Paradox machine"" whose purpose was to rip a hole and cause a paradox. The word was literally said more times in an RTD finale than *any* Moffat finale! Or perhaps his series 4, where the setup was a universe breaking and they had to stop it?

&gt;BEETHOVEN! PANDORICA!

Beethoven wasn't Moffat and Pandorica is generally highly rated as a finale, matching or outdoing most other finales.

&gt;THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IS AN ANGEL

Yeah but at no point was there ""LOOK HOW CLEVER I AM HERE"". And this is not that much more ridiculous than Dobby The Doctor."
55,"Because they're the great unequalizer.  The more you feel a need for personal power, the more likely you are to purchase one, and the less the rest of society wants you to have one.  As with political power, the people I'd like to see with guns are the ones that don't want them."

61,"It is. Somewhat. The whole time I thought Joel was a noble person, willing to sacrifice his life for people. Turns out he’s way more selfish than I thought. Which makes him more human which is good I guess but I’m still pissed at wasting all that time. Really ruined the game for me. "
62,"Yeah, I get that, but why is this funny?"
63,"I forget the official word, but stacking votes during elections. Usually by democrats, they’ll hire a bus full of people (usually illegal immigrants) and go to a bunch of polling places and cast their votes. It’s so common that candidates who don’t do it have to adjust their predicted numbers to account for the extra ones by the other side, in order to get accurate predictions about how they’ll perform. It’s all over California. "

72,"Nope, Europe's got us beat at that. We're fit and they're shit."
73,"I think you mean Bruce. And the fact that his name is Bruce should be enough to answer your question.

I don't care one way or the other but we need to decide as a nation if being an innie or an outie determines where you poop or nah. Because if someone can claim to be a woman but still has dangly bits and that's enough to let them into the women's room, then what's the point in having a women's room in the first place?

We either care or we don't. And if Bruce can deuce in the ladies' crapper instead of the laddies, then Mildred better STFU when Big Hairy Mike comes strolling in with a colon full of chili dogs."
74,"Eggs. I mean a dude looks at a chicken's ass and sees this white thing come out of it and goes, ""I'm gonna eat that?"""

82,He's still the Great One. 
83,"Yeah bro you fucked yourself. 100 percent of a the time a realtor will get you a better deal than no representation. Guaranteed. 

Yes you pay a realtor money, but you are getting a better deal. Realtor's also have connections in the mortgage industry who can get you deals. 

If you went to a bank instead of a mortgage company, you got reamed in the ass with a sandpaper dildo. "
84,Loool we brothers or something. I answered the exact same thing. 
85,"Yeah, which makes me wonder why you took the option to inject yourself into this conversation. "
86, she does act stupid and she sounds stupid and I think she really is stupid but her music is good pretty hot
87,[deleted]
88,Counter: why do you deserve someone else's attention if you can't catch it or maintain it? People acting like they're being purposely ignored lol. Just get better at participating in conversation.

""Haha opinion I disagree with!!! I hope YOU do not have KIDS!!! &gt;:))""

90,Yeah i will have a bombastic time!
91,You seem very sensetive.
92,Isn’t it funny how that “Hey that dude might be packin’ and shoot me in the dick if I get mouthy” sort of culture makes most people more polite?
93,"Nope. Too easy or waaay too hard combat, no in between. Boring grind game, not worth it at all. I put 30ish hours in and returned it. 0/10 i dont recomend. Also, its missing some english dialogue. Not a huge deal, but still annoying. 
"
94,"this thread is full of people who have no idea what ""fetish"" means and they are just saying ""weird quirky stuff I do that I like"".  That is not a fetish -_-

"
95,"The terms of discussion are important.   


If we are talking about culture, we should talk about culture.  


If he meant to say culture, why did he say race? Why make the conversation increasingly more difficult to have by using words you don't mean and conflating terms?  


Also, no, I don't think he was doing what you generously point out, which i would agree with. He specifically said ""the influence of race in the world"" and ""sweden was definitely better when it was more white"". It is that former part that racially charges the latter beyond doubt.

96,"Also, the epic games launcher requires you to install fortnite, but you can avoid this by not having enough space on your drive."

98,the king
99,1 is way better. The only way i could get through my 2nd playthrough of bl2 was by doing a shield glitch. Otherwise id just get 1 shot by enemies. 
100,"&gt; because you feel stupid for not knowing about the compatibility settings.

Lmfao. Compatibility settings aren't some secret high tier fix for everything. And the game **will** still crash even with these settings on. It's not a magic fix.

Fuck off lmao. Sounds like you haven't been a PC gamer very long if you think someone doesn't know about those settings.

110,"You think both are mutually exclusive?

Lmfao"
111,"God of War is objectively a fantastic game. Calling it ""another God of War"" demonstrates that you just haven't played the game to understand why it's so radically different from its predecessors and unique in its own way. "

131,So no real evidence then. Because if there was a real smoking gun it would be constantly on the media. 
132,"Honest question: What if it's something like that genetic thing with Cilantro? Personally I love Cilantro, but my friend has that gene where Cilantro tastes like dirty soap scum water and if the flavor gets into her dish, it ruins the whole meal. Would that be okay to say you have an allergy to?"
133,"If it's too much trouble for someone ""knowledgeable"" they are not knowledgeable. Sorry. But I do agree with the rest, it's far from ""easy"" for a normie to get into that and it isn't something to jump into either. It's something to live in and with in day to day life. "
134,"Have you seen the international version? In that longer version, Leon clearly does reciprocate her feelings and it isn’t a one way, girl with a crush, type thing. It is a worse movie for it, but is worth watching if you want to see what his more complete “vision” was."
