18,"You want to know what America is like?  I have/had a friend last year who was a complete red-neck, crazy Trump supporter. I always thought he was nice, but a little misguided. Then he bought a confederate flag and had his mom sew it into basically a confederate version of Uncle Sam's costume. He would wear it to school at least once a week and usually get into fights with kids after school who talked bad about President Trump. One time we were at a party and he lost his temper and threw a beer bottle at the DJ's head when he changed the song from Metallica to Nickelback.  Welcome to America."
19,"Ah, the belief that private companies will do what is right either out of their own interest or because they're being paid to do so. I do not agree with your belief here.

&gt; Literally everything you mentioned I'd rather do privately.

Ok, understandable. Let's play one out then.

In this scenario let's assume there is a town with lots of families. The world is as you wish it - everything I listed is done privately, including policing. The town has a group of people acting as police who are compensated privately from the businesses in town. 

Family 1 owns a pig farm. A privately held company. Not too big but big enough that other townspeople can notice the smell. Family 2 owns a vegan restaurant. Again, a privately help company. From the restaurant you can very frequently smell the pig farm and they believe this is causing customers to avoid their establishment.

Family 2 decides that pig farms need to do more to combat the smell emanating from their farms. Family 1 scoffs at their idea because to do so would adversely impact their profits.

Family 2, being the owners of other business, decides it has enough money to fund a second police force in this town. And then they send that police force to Family 1's farm to enforce their new rule.

Family 1, also wealthy business owners, decides it has the ability to fund its own police force and tasks that force with protecting its land.

Now you have two police forces fighting at the behest of their benefactors. Play the rest out in your head. What do you honestly think would happen?

In my opinion, without a social construct of a government provided and publicly funded police force, the basic human nature of greed will drive behaviors and situations like this. I do not agree with your claims that privately constructed and funded services will lead to a better or more just society."

22,"Ah, wonderful. I love dispelling a good gish gallop.

&gt;Ok, let me broaden the scope here:
&gt;Who defines what causes ineligibility?

Clever strawman. It's not ""who"" that defines ineligibility, but *what.* As I said previously, dementia is quantifiable.

&gt;Who picks the people who diagnose?

There's no ""people who diagnose."" There are tests that can be administered (and even made public if you're paranoid about a dementia test somehow being partisan) to measure intellectual regression.

&gt;How do we ensure their impartiality, and the appearance of their impartiality?

Again, pretty inapplicable in terms of dementia tests. The tests themselves are already established, work, and do not rely on the interpretation of the person administering them.

&gt;I’m just suggesting that it’s all but impossible in this climate, and would be a constant battle over the validity of results.

It wouldn't be impossible. What would the backlash be aside from some asinine complaints from already ignorant people?

&gt;All you have to do is look at the mouth breathers still clinging to Trump like he’s a genius.  That’s 30-40% of the electorate.  You think they won’t complain about their candidate being seems unfit?  They don’t trust science as it is....

124,"I don't care what two consenting adults do, its the gay affect on the media and culture that I have a problem with. The parades, the propaganda, censorship, the fact that its being shoved down children's throat. I'm going to get many dislikes for this post but it just proves my point, if I was to express this opinion in real life I would be outcast, despite not being hostile towards anyone.

Today you can't say that being gay might be nurture as well as nature, despite the facts that nobody ever discovered the ""gay gene"" and there are identical twins where one is gay and the other isn't. There are lectures about it at elementary schools, and even earlier sometimes, which I see as brainwashing. 

Being gay means you are physically attracted to the members of the same sex, which means by nature you can't reproduce and you were born with an abnormality, it doesn't mean you should be mistreated, but it doesn't mean you should be celebrated either, some people are born with down syndrome, some are autistic, many people are born with one defect or another, and we learn to live, as long as you're not harmful to others. That being said, being gay does not make you ""fabulous"", it doesn't make you an expert in fashion and what looks good, it doesn't give you special status. No, not everyone is even a little bit gay, that's another propaganda to make you feel ""normal"". No, not everyone who don't like gays is a closet homosexual, again, more scare tactics to silence people. No, if a man doesn't want anything inserted in his ass that does not make him a homophobe either.

The percentage of gay people is actually fairly small, yet now in every show or movie, if there are 5 or more important characters, at least one will be gay (although that's an issue with the pc culture in general). "

132,"My college roommate's girlfriend.

She and him met junior year, and when they met, they didn't go a single day without seeing each other for their firs t6 months. A few weeks in, she jokingly (maybe, could have been for real) talked about getting married and naming their children. When drinking, she would run out of our apartment and down the hall, avoiding my roomate. Other times, she would run towards our window or balcony and attempt to jump (we lived on the second floor, would have hurt but she would have survived for sure). Other times, she would have a total of four or five drinks, and this would get her belligerently drunk, to the point where I had to hold her hair back while she vomited in our toilet.

I didn't see any red flags with this behavior, even though this all occurred within their first few months of dating. What really caught my eye was what happened over that winter break, 3 months in.

My other roomate was trying to cook something, but the kitchen was a mess due to the couple's laziness and lack of cleaning. She texted the couple about it, who when they came home from being out, berated her about how she inappropriately texted them and it wasn't their fault. This fight ended up causing my other roomate to cry, storm out, and head home for the night. I confronted the couple about it, who felt no remorse. 

When your friends don't give a fuck that they made another friend cry and leave their home over something small, that's when you realize they crazy asf."

I've seen and heard from many clinical psychologists (and variations thereof), and I have never, never heard any of them say that chemical imbalance is not a thing, or that simply going to therapy will cure anyone.

From my perspective, and from what I've heard most professionals say, is that chemical imbalances prove that our biology is *not* one way, and that's why everybody's biological makeup, while similar, is different.

For some, therapy on its own can and does help. For some, drugs are required, as well as or instead of therapy. 

Your neurotransmitters will not get any idea if there is an natural chemical imbalance that causes them to literally not be able to. To teach that this is the only answer is actually dangerous, and if this is what your training is telling you, I strongly suggest you find another training institution.
