"My first elementary school ""boyfriend"" is now my husband. We had known each other since first grade, I had a crush on him in 6th and decided to ask him to the dance. He said yes, we ""dated"" for the first half of summer until he went out of town and I didn't hear from him so I thought it was over (drama of a 12 y/o girl). Never had one class together all through Jr. High or High School. Ended up at a party together when we were 19, his buddy decided to date a friend of mine so we hung out a few times. One night we stayed up talking all night about our hopes and dreams and have been together since then."
