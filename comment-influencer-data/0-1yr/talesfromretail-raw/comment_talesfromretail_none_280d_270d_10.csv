0,"That's pretty crazy... I had a customer - in front of me in check out line, get all pissy with the cashier about something - I forget. I looked at the guy and said, ""Wouldn't it be nice to have good customer service?"" He said, ""Well yes, it certainly would."" I took a step closer to him and said, ""Then start being a good customer."" He was speechless."
1,"In my grocery store days we closed at midnight every night but Sunday.

One time I was making my final closing announcement (we made several), but I always walked the store to make sure there were no stragglers.

I find a woman with a giant cart of food staring at a package of butter like she's an inspector.

Me: ""Hi miss, we are closing the store and will need you to bring your carriage to the registers and check out.""

Her: ""No I will not. I will stay until I have finished shopping or I will call the police.""

Me: ""...go ahead and call them.""

Her: ""Excuse me!?""

Me: ""Please let them know that you are refusing to leave a store after closing hours and they will be happy to remove you themselves.""

Her: ""WELL I NEVER, WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER, BLAH BLAH BLAH""

&amp;#x200B;

I was the closing supervisor (the last manager left at 11, the only other manager was the Night Crew Chief who dgaf about customers) so I told her this.

HER: ""I AM NOT LEAVING!!!""

Me: ""No problem.""

I took her carriage as she stood there apoplectic and started walking away with it.

Me: ""You can come up with me right now and purchase your groceries or I will put them away and call the police that you are refusing to leave. The choice is yours.""

She stood there another few seconds plotting her next course of action, realized that she wasn't getting her way and finally came up front and checked out.

Before she left she of course dropped the ""I'LL BE CALLING YOUR MANAGER IN THE MORNING!!!!!""

Me: ""You do you miss. Have a fantastic evening!""

I had zero fucks left to give at that job and nothing came of it other than the manager saying some ""crazy batshit lady called"", calling me all types of names and us laughing about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: a couple words"
2,"I've got a head scratcher for ya. I used to work in a meat department of a farmer's market type grocery store. Had a lady come in and ask all sorts of questions of where we sourced our seafood from, what was better in terms of farmed vs. Wild, what the difference was. I shouldn't have said ""Well, farmed fish are raised in a controlled environment to either help the species out due to over fishing or invasive predators dwindling its numbers and whatnot, slight dofferences in taste and texture, that kind of stuff."" 

Without skipping a beat, her version of farmed fish did not add up to what a normal person would put together and syarts asking me for grass fed salmon. I tried to tell her there was no such thing and tried to help her correct her misunderstanding of what farming meant in regards to seafood, but she wouldn't budge, and started yelling about how ""You lied to me, they're not raised on farms because they weren't fed an orgabic grass diet, yada yada yada"" and then starts demanding my manager. Cue the entire conversation her and I had now between her and my supervisor. She got angry, stomped off, and two days later we got a store complaint about how the employees were ""inept and argumentative and tried to sell her on lies.""

To this day, I cannot fathom how low her IQ must have been or how little caffiene she must have had in her system that day."
3,Part 2:  she gets to your register and you ask her if she found everything alright and she freaks out all over again
4,One time a customer INSISTED to me that an item was 1¢ when it was ringing up for a dollar. I figured it was an old sign even though our penny sales had been done for a while. I had my manager do a price check so she showed him where she found it. He came back to tell me that he had to explain to her the difference between a cent sign and a dollar sign -_-
5,Little old lady time traveller blew her cover whilst shopping for salad dressing.
6,"Where does she keep them when she gets home?  Is her bathroom cupboard sterilized regularly?  I’m so confused, and I’m a woman.

Does she realize those packages were all boxed and shipped and could have been contaminated by ...  you know, germs? Along the way?  That people touched them to stock them and you had to touch them and they were bagged and placed in a car or something and so do so many other places they could have gotten dirty or germs?"
7,"""They're in the trees ma'am. Just make bird calls if you need them."""
8,"I worked with a couple that got caught up in drugs.  I found the girl in the break room ~~balling~~ bawling her eyes out.  She told me they had spent all their savings, maxed out their credit cards and had stolen and maxed out their parents cards.  The thing that put her over the edge was just before coming to work she had stolen her BF's game console and brought it to their dealer to get some coke; the dealer was wearing her great grandmothers diamond ring.  Turns out her BF had stolen it a few hours earlier and traded it for some coke."
9,"I hate people like this. At the store I work at we have announcements for 15. 10, and 5 minutes before closing.

Don't get mad at us for closing a store with set hours. Get mad at yourself for coming in so late. We don't work around your schedule once you enter."
10,Anyone so challenged that they can watch you exit and not figure out that they can exit the same way probably shouldn't go outside anyways. They might get eaten or something.
11,I’m sorry but people like this are golden. I love when you have the opportunity to show someone their own stupidity. 
12,"Dude where I work once got mad when I asked him if he wanted a bag for his single pack of pens. 

All ""why the fuck would you ask me if I want a bag rather than just bagging it? That's the problem with your generation"""
13,That wouldve been more fun than the real part 2: my coworker helping her while the lady rants about me for the entire purchase
14,"I have dealt with a deaf older man who’s two daughters accompany him to translate and all I know is ‘thank you’, so I signed it and then apologized that it was all I knew. His daughters conveyed that to him and he signed right back that ‘sometimes ‘thank you’ is all you need’ and it was just a really heartwarming thing "
15,"I really want to know what she meant by the food being ""together"" "
16,No better feeling than being backed 100% by your manager and not being made to look like the ass.
17,"I had something equally confusing happen to me earlier last week, lady came in asking about a pair of pants for her daughter for Christmas. She wasn't 100% sure about how she felt about them and wanted some time to think about it. She looks at me and asks me ""what day does Christmas fall on this year?"" I check the calander and tell her it's on a Tuesday this year and put the calander away. She for some reason did not like the answer, glares at me and snaps ""well that doesn't answer my question!! Whatever I'll figure it out myself!"" And storms out...not sure what else she was looking for considering Christmas is the 25th of December every year, I'm still a little confused, maybe these to ladies are related."
18,Good job to the parents!
19,"Some aggressive people don't think they're being taken seriously until someone is yelling back at them.

In this case, I might've obliged."
20," *""I'LL BE CALLING YOUR MANAGER IN THE MORNING!!!!!""* 

&amp;#x200B;

I encourage you to!!  That's the person that set the policies we've explained to you.  Then you and that person can hash it out!"
21,"Did you explain to her that salmon, do not in fact, eat grass? When you said farms did she imagine them flopping about on a fenced off pasture? "
22,"One time I heard a lady yelling at some pharmacists because she was waiting at the drop off window waiting to pick up when there was clearly a line for pickup (idiot) and when I told her not to speak to the pharmacists like that she told me it was none of my business. I said lady, when you start yelling and I can hear you throughout the store it is most definitely my business at that point. Then she tried to complain to the 18 year old minimum wage worker at the cash register. Move on, bitch "
23,"This is why i could not work retail because if you give me a question like

""Jezus Christ, you think I am stupid? I don't need this exact one ? Why the hell would I need tha same one. Are you stupid? Do you think I'm dumb enough to buy the same book twice ?""

The answer is clearly yes."
24,"This is how you parent, and that must have been so satisfying to finally ""tell off"" someone as a retail worker. And you helped (hopefully) set her straight"
25,"I think some people don't consider that product exists before they personally see or handle it. See all the people who freak out over the idea of their clothing purchases touching a checklane belt because in their minds the clothes are clean and pristine rather than something that really should be washed before being worn anyway. The clothes popped into existence on the rack in the store as far as they are concerned, the many hands and conditions between cloth manufactured somewhere in Southeast Asia to them picking it off the rack simply doesn't enter their minds."
26,Ahh the trash version of ‘Gift of the Magi’
27,"Same story happened to me. I asked her if she'd like a bag for her one, small item. I didn't just hand it to her without a bag and I didn't ask it rudely but she gave me the *nastiest* look, says ""well isn't that your job!??"" then went off on this completely unnecessary rant about how she never understands why cashier's ask customers if they want bags. My manager told her it's a preference thing especially when it's a single item purchase. She wasn't having it. 

Screw you lady. Just leave and be vile somewhere else. Lord help the polite person who asks her that question again. "
28,"No patrick, the lid!"
29,My hypothesis is that she saw someone get their groceries paid for by someone else by saying this to a cashier and didn't understand that that person's (whoever) was the one paying and she thought it was a magical code for free stuff.
30,"People who always look for trouble can easily find it.

The worst part is they _always_ blame someone else for how miserable their own lives are."
31,All he had to do was call your store first to avoid all of this. 😂
32,"Not gonna even try to pretend like I'm not that stupid sometimes 


Once at 3am getting coffee at 7 eleven

The cashier was basically counting my change for me like I was a 3 year old.

To be fair, he was spot on


We still laugh about when I see him"
33,"retail workers - *exists*

customers - what's wrong with you"
34,Well played XD At least she didn't throw a fit or anything. She knew what she did XD
35,That’s the staff exit! We’re still trapped!!
36,"**Day 1:** We are trapped! I watched an employee leave, but it must have been a employee only entrance. Hopefully the mall will open on the morrow.

**Day 3:** We keep on seeing people enter and leave but nobody has explicitly told us we can use those doors. We remain hopeful for rescue and the food court provides necessary but expensive sustenance. We may have to start rationing soon.

**Day 5:** We finally found someone in security who pointed us at the employee exits. He's clearly confused and mistaken us for employees or is taunting us in our captivity.

**Day 7:** Our funds are exhausted from subsisting solely on the food court's offerings. We've seen hundreds of individuals enter and leave through various doors, how can a mall have so many employees? If this continues much longer we risk starvation, we may have to brave the employee exit.

**Day 9:** Before we succumbed to weakness from hunger we tried the employee exit. Our captors either took pity on us or were distracted for we are free! Free!

**Day 10:** We left a scathing online review hoping to spare others our ordeal.

Edit: Cleaned up some grammar."
37,This is what I’m going to do when I retire. Hang out near registers and be the cashier’s advocate. 
38,"This reminds me of the little gaming store I used to live by. The owner just had the prices include tax so for instance the 1.99 soda was actually 1.99. However if anyone ever made a stink about it or questioned it too much he would add tax on top of that.

(Just to head off some of you he did calculate tax and stuff properly. He just put in a price that would end up equaling 1.99 after tax. Those that annoyed him would have 1.99 put in before tax. There was a little sheet of paper with the common prices on it next to his register. The regulars there would sometimes man the register or ring themselves out if he was busy with an MTG tournament.)"
39,"The cashier probably thought who needs 12 calculators, but then it started to make sense to her lol"
40,"On top of that, Google Translate is an amazing conversation tool for non-deaf interactions. Last week I was able to help a Chinese lady who only knew ""hello"" and ""thank you"" while I didn't know a single word of Chinese. I'd strongly recommend that for any language barriers with customers.

But it definitely helps if you have a specific language that's popular in your area to learn it for convenience!"
41,I want an owner/store manager like that.  Amazing.
42,"Sounds like there's probably a lot more on her mind and that shrimp issue was just the last straw that overwhelmed her. If I had a breakdown I'd be glad to hear ideas like, ""maybe you can call or video chat your husband and have him work through it with you on the phone, or leave it in the freezer or ask a friend for help if you can't physically handle parts of it."" She could have a physical illness or invisible disability that makes peeling shrimp impossible or painful for her hands. I hope things worked out for her and she found something to eat even if the shrimp were off the table. 

I don't usually sympathise with customers in these things and hate ""devils advocates,"" but the way she sounds like she was acting and the way this was worded sounds a lot like having a breakdown from being overwhelmed by everything. I've had things pile up so much that not being able to open the spaghetti sauce jar was the last straw that had me in tears and freaking out about not knowing what to do, so I've been there. I wouldn't go all the way to a store to return anything old like that (I don't feel comfortable returning food in general), but I can see how something so weird could lead to that kind of emotional response. "
43,"My husband‘s birthday is on the 13th. One year that was a friday.
We thought that was cool and I said something like
„That’s cool, I wonder when my birthday will be on a Friday the 13th, next“.
He looked bemused.

My birthday is on the 8th of the month..."
44,"There's a comment in an AskReddit thread about people's weird habits about a guy who has two hampers: one for outerwear and one for underwear. If any underwear should find itself in the outerwear hamper, he'd throw out the whole thing, clothes and all, saying they're ""contaminated"". His wife reminded him of two things: both hamper's contents get washed in the same load regardless and that his underwear touches his pants *while he's wearing them*. I would've loved to have seen the look on his face as his brain stops responding while he tries to process this information."
45,"Lol this reminds me of an opposite situation - had a customer come up super concerned about why a bottle of soda or something was priced at 12.99! I was confused too, that would be a crazy expensive bottle of soda, maybe someone put up the wrong sign? So we went and looked. Turned out the sign (as did all the beverage section signs) had artwork of a cup of soda with a straw in it in the background. She mistook the straw for the number 1.  It was 2.99. It was pretty obvious to me it wasn’t a 1, it was a different color than the numbers, candy striped, and washed out (background image, remember). But she complained so we had to change all the signs in that section, despite them having been used for years and no one else ever having an issue with them. *sigh*"
46,She probably thought in her mind that if she says together she'll get everything for the price of one
47,"Or they just want to trigger some sort of negative emotion in you. While working in tech support, and speaking in my very neutral voice, I had an irate customer yell at me ""you don't sound like you care enough about my problem! transfer me to someone who's afraid of losing their job over this!"""
48,"I love the argument ""made up rule"" as if basically all rules weren't made up either"
49,"I hate people like that. Where I work we only make closing announcements occasionally since there usually aren’t many, if any, customers in the store around closing time. We have a regular customer who is just a pain in the ass - she knows exactly what time we close and still chooses to come in about 10 minutes before closing. She takes her time wandering the store before coming to the register, where she moves as slowly as possible during her transaction, and then takes another century to stand there and study her receipt before leaving. One night, after an especially long and irritating day, she comes in right before closing. Since I’m almost at the end of my rope as far as patience goes, I decide to make closing announcement so she knows we’re closing soon and we’re waiting on her. It kind of works as she doesn’t stay as long past closing as usual but as I’m unlocking the door to let her out (which was locked because we closed 20 minutes earlier) she has to nerve to look me in the face and say “you know, it’s really rude to rush customers out of the store like that.” My jaw literally dropped open. I would have loved to say “well, you know, it’s really rude to come in here when you know we’re closing and trying to go home. We have lives too and would like to leave on time at the end of our shift.” But I just nodded and said “hmmmm” as I slammed the door shut as soon as she was clear of it. "
50,"This reminds me of a story I have. 

I work at a women’s clothing store, and we send people what is essentially a store credit during their birthday month.

Once, a coworker and I were side by side checking people out. A lady comes up to my coworker with a return and asks if we can do a price adjustment on something she bought the day before with the birthday discount. Since the credit applied evenly to all of the other clothes she bought, she wanted the credit that had been applied to the shirt she was returning applied to the rest of the clothes. However, she didn’t have the clothes with her for the adjustment. I overheard the conversation and told her that our policy is that we have to have the physical clothes to price adjust them. I added that she can absolutely come back and bring the clothes with her, and we could do it then. 

Her: But I just bought these yesterday?

Me: Yes, unfortunately, the time you bought them doesn’t change the policy.

Her: Well, nowadays, price adjustments are all done online. (I have no idea what she meant by this.)

Me: We still have to have the clothes in store to price adjust them. 

She doesn’t say anything to that but glares at me unflinchingly for the rest of her transaction, which took about two minutes. It was extremely uncomfortable....and also kind of hilarious. "
51,"Bawling. Balling your eyes out is a violent act that involves removing your own eyes with a melon baller.

Edit: thanks for the silver! My first ever."
