0,"At last, someone has lived the dream."
1,...Wine is not brownish red. Period blood can be. She just straight up asked you to smell her period blood stains.
2,Ugh. She was being inappropriate. Just remember that customers don't have the right to force you to act in ways that make you feel uncomfortable.
3,"Oh sweet mother of mercy. I'm so sorry this happened to you. You tried to do the right thing, and I hope that karma bites that woman in the ass, *hard*. Please don't feel bad, your conscience is clear."
4,I think you meant anaphylaxis instead of antifascists
5,"I used to work at a pizza store. A customer called in once complaining that we delivered a pizza that was not only cold, but it had a rock in. Yes, a rock!

I gently explained it couldn't have been our fault and she kept insisting it was - until I explained that we don't deliver. Click!

Some people, just trying to get free stuff."
6,"This happened to me when I first worked in retail many many years ago.

A smiling happy guy came into my line and wanted cigarettes. I asked him for ID. He said he had none, and that it was in the car.

""Cool"", I said, ""I'll still be here when you get back.""

He paused for a moment, his friendly smile turning more serious as he realised I wasn't going to sell him the smokes until he showed me ID.

""How old do I look?"", he says.
""I don't know. I mean you *look* old enough sure, but we have to be certain. And my job is on the line."", I reply.

Suddenly his friendly demeanor turned around and he became more flustered and irate. 
""Y'know what, screw you"", he says, ""fuck this!"" and storms away.

I'd had enough by this stage, I'd been reasonable, polite and calm - so as a parting gift I yell back to him,
""GO FUCK YOURSELF!"".

I turn around to see the next person in line at my counter, they're looking a bit shocked at the exchange. I smile at them and say ""Hello! How are you?"" and proceed to ring them through like nothing has happened.

A bit later, I decide to tell my manager about what happen (just in case it came back to bite me on the ass). 

She shrugs and says, ""It happens."""
7,"&gt; She also complained to my boss that I didn't laugh at her joke, and that not laughing equaled bad customer service. 

Nice that she outed herself as a nutjob and avoided a shred of credibility."
8,"I love how she insists on not donating, but still forgets her change!"
9,"Nevermind that, what kind of manager tells an employee to wait when they say it’s urgent."
10,"My god, how could she work there, its literally a minefield of allergic reactions"
11,It's a ghost of a shopper long since dead.
12,But it's not her husband.
13,Aren't you liable for incidents to customers outside opening hours? As in your insurance does not cover customer injury if they are in store when you are not open. Might be worth running that past Manager.
14,"""If you really cared, you would give all your savings.""

Two can play at that game.  If *you* really cared, you'd put in all *your* savings, crazy lady. But you don't care, do you crazy lady?"
15,Does her store not have Telecheck or a similar service that authenticates checks as they’re used?
16,"Omg pharmacy customers were the worst this way, especially when the weather was nice. They keep their hand written Rx for two weeks and then one day decide they are so sick we must stay open late so they can get it filled. Why hadn’t they filled it earlier in the day? Busy at work? School? No.... they were usually at the beach an hour away. This was back in the day when are computers were slow af to start up also so once you turned them off they were off for the night."
17,Its feels good huh?  Welcome to the Elites.
18,"&gt; I finally just interrupt her, rude I know,

I think you're allowed a pass if some bitch is about to shove A %100 PERIOD STAIN (I'm a girl, I know what ""reddish brown"" is on underwear) in your face."
19,"&gt;antifascists

I laughed."
20,It feels like being bathed in the warm embrace of a higher power.
21,"Eh im used to it by know. This one just surprised me how much she wanted me to say the word “pantie”. Probably since I look younger that what I am, she thought I’ve never seen ones or something. At the end of the day, I got a good laugh out from my girlfriend so its all good"
22,Well to be fair “the bottom one” does sound a little like something a 4 year old kid would say. Underwear or underpants is what I’d probably say to a customer.
23,"It seems he forgets he said that, then it's just rinse and repeat."
24,I had a similar situation with a woman claiming her husband died and wanting to turn gifts he bought her. It was always last seasons clothes past their return dates.She did this multiple times with multiple associates. I caught her on her fourth or fifth return. I asked her if she was a polygamist or a black widow. She ran out of the store. Never saw her again.
25,"My dad had something like this, but the pharmacist took pity on him and filled his script. My dad had gotten his wisdom teeth pulled earlier that day and gotten a script for painkillers, but he really didn't like taking painkillers and it didn't feel too bad afterwards so he figured just ibuprofen would be fine. 

Well then the local anesthetic started wearing off and the pain was getting excruciating, way more than just ibuprofen could help with. He got to the pharmacy about 5 after they closed and the pharmacist was heading out, but he could see how much pain my dad was in and opened back up to fill his script."
26,I just facepalmed so hard I gave myself a concussion. Please keep us updated on the fallout.
27,"Oh, I thought she had bought them, used them for the ceremony, then lied about dead babies for a refund. I think this is worse."
28,"I'm not sure what service they use to authenticate checks, but I do know that the internet around here sucks ass so they probably don't have a good enough connection to actually check on it live/per-transaction. This is part of why only managers are allowed to take checks (because they know the procedure, and how to appropriately take the customer's information in case it bounces or comes up fraudulent)."
29,"Is she fucking dumb? Like even if you had splattered the cake in her face, she still wouldn’t have understood"
30,TBH I'm wondering if maybe the cashier was in on it. There's no way they did this as a mistake.
31,"I absolutely believe that people should be refused service for their behaviour. So often I want to remind people that they are in public and that they’re being unacceptable. I wish I could refuse service and tell people to leave when they’re rude and antagonistic, because being like that should not be reinforced."
32,The manager that screamed polo is the real MVP
33,*slap* BAD DAD. NO
34,"We actually have a running joke here at work that there's a mall ghost here, because our fridge make weird noises sometimes, and whenever something weird has been done and no one owns up to it we blame the mall ghost"
35,"This really makes me wonder what brings a person to be a regular thief and on top of that, actually *scream* at the staff when they catch you"
36,"Reminds me on one time I was working in a supermarket 8 years ago.
 I was at the register at the time, and with my back towards the entrance. I was serving a customer at the time when I suddenly feel something grabbing my leg. I turned around and see the boss's 4 year old daughter clinging to me. She looks up at me with a shock on her face and runs back to her mom who was giggling at it all.
I can see why she was mistaken, as although I am a bit taller, I had the same build and similar hair as the boss at the time."
37,"She never actually refused, she just rudely questioned the validity of doing so, and demanded the cashier do it."
38,"""Wait, I'm helping this customer choose between salami and ham. Priorities OP"""
