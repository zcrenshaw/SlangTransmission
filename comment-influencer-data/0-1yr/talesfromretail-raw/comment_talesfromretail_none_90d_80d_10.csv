0,I mean like on its base anyone can understand idiota as idiot. Not a terribly clever slur to use.
1,Yay a positive one. Thanks for being patient with her and helping her out
2,She deserved to be banned permanently. What a cow.
3,"Why do customers think that stores aren't allowed to change their prices? That's like working at a gas station and someone going to the register like ""yesterday it was 10 cents cheaper, so you owe it to me for that price!"" wtf?"
4,i feel bad for all the people with parents like this
5,I‚Äôd fucking ruin that ladies life if she grabbed me like that.
6,"Top 3 basic things which are the hardest for customers:

&amp;#x200B;

1).  Reading

2.)  Basic Math

3.)  Patience"
7,"https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/39690

&gt;Furthermore, tobacco smoke, as ""particulate matter,"" has the physical properties capable of making contact. R.C. 3704.01(B) and 5709.20(A); Ohio Adm.Code 3745-17.

&gt;As alleged in Leichtman's complaint, when Furman intentionally blew cigar smoke in Leichtman's face, under Ohio common law, he committed a battery."
8,Chemical spill always takes priority over sales.  Anything that's a liability concern really.  A slip and fall risk? Better clean that up before letting a customer through.  Losing a few bucks on a sale is less than the thousands a slip and fall would cost let alone a fire.
9,Completely untenable and inappropriate!
10,Yeah he wasn't the brightest bulb lmao
11,"I'm a sucker for people who are a ""little short"" and start to put stuff back. If it's just a few buck, ""I got that for you, pass it on when you can"".

The only time I regretted it was this sweet old lady expressed her gratitude by telling me her life story, normally ok, but I was in a super hurry that day."
12,"I have to do money drops at my store as well, and the amount of people who try to get all up and personal is ridiculous. Especially when they then get offended when they get treated like potential thieves"
13,I feel better knowing there are people like YW that see their parents' behavior for what it is and don't copy it.
14,"&gt; That's like working at a gas station and someone going to the register like ""yesterday it was 10 cents cheaper, so you owe it to me for that price!""  

...you know that happens, right?

People are crazy."
15,"&gt; We take items whether they‚Äôre used or not. 

Yeah, it's always amusing when someone is coming up with this convoluted or far-fetched tale to justify the return and you're just sitting there with a retail smile frozen on your face thinking, ""Please finish this unnecessary story. You could have just said you changed your mind."" It's like the people who insist they never used the coffee machine while the smell of coffee wafts up from the damp box, you don't have to lie to me, by policy we'll still take it back."
16,"This is actually a really interesting phenomenon imo! They did a study on this sort of thing in an economics book I‚Äôve read (might have been Contagious or Superfreakonomics) where they sent out two kinds of flyers - one that advertised pants, and the other one that advertised the same thing at the same price, but ‚Äúon sale‚Äù was written on it. The ‚Äúon sale‚Äù one got way more buyers! People really are attracted to deals."
17,I once had a little old lady come in with an ad from the store that was across the street.  She wanted to buy a pair of shoes from that ad and would not believe me that I didn‚Äôt carry them.  I showed her that the ad was for the other store and she said ‚ÄúBut I came here to buy them!‚Äù  That was a fun day.
18,"Wow, the first non spineless manager I‚Äôve seen in a while..."
19,"&gt;Me to the homeless guy ""would you like a bag of bread as well"" we give out free bread. he tried to give me his $3 but I told him it was free and to be safe. 

‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
20,I‚Äôd bet money she was the one that took the hose out of the box in the first place.
21,"We all would. Sometimes, you freeze. You don't know why, but you did. You replay it, in your head, every once in a while. Always asking, ""what if I didn't?"""
22,And illegal / cause for retaliation in most states
23,What part of do not leave the pump unattended escaped this woman?
24,.... I can't even fathom considering this to be a okay thing to do.
25,"If her friend really died, she has no dignity whatsoever and should be ashamed to use the deceased to save a few bucks.


If this is a lie (which most likely is) she is a lying piece of human garbage who plays with the compassion of honest and generous people."
26,Should have taken her to the aisle with the boxes of potato flakes.
27,"Well, step one is to kick her out, in this case she kicked herself out so that's already covered :)"
28,"Only a minute? She didn't look very hard for those collectable cookie jars, did she?"
29,Bless you. Not all heroes wear capes! üíú
30,I love it when the trash takes itself out.
31,"... ""Yippers"""
32,I know right.  The lady said that she set it so she ‚Äúcould go do other things‚Äù and I‚Äôm wondering what other things need doing at that particular moment?
33,I'm surprise the luggage itself wasn't packed full of other stuff they were trying to swipe.
34,"I honestly don't understand why they're so compelled to ask, as well and then get so offended when they don't like the answer. Maybe don't seem so fucking suspicious?"
35,"I worked in electronics sales for a few years, and this definitely happens. If it's a dollar or two cheaper, I don't see the fuss, but if you bought that $1.5k camera yesterday and you come in with today's ad and it's $250 cheaper, that's worth pursuing. As long as you're within the return period, and you bring the camera in to show it's still in returnable condition, I'll do a return/resale. It's either that, or you return it at my store then drive to our sister store in the mall and re-buy it at the better price and now we have an open, used camera we can't sell. The rapport you build with your customers by helping them out like this builds your reputation as a store and sales rep, not that you're a pushover, but you're honest and truly there for the customer."
36,The birth of a conspiracy theory. Balloon earth is real!
37,"It's like that scene in scrooged. ""Fire these people!!"" ""They're voulenteers!"""
