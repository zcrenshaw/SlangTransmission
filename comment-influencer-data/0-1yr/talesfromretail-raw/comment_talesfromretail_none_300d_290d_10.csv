0,"One Christmas a few years ago, my boss calls me up on Christmas day and asks me to open up for an hour or so for a customer to do some quick shopping. Because I lived nearby and needed the extra cash, I did so. The customer spent 2 hours browsing, bought one of the cheapest items in the store, and then had the absolute nerve to spout that line. I swear to god that I almost killed him right there."
1,"&gt; can‚Äôt give you money back for something you didn‚Äôt buy here


‚ÄúFINE.  I‚ÄôM NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN!‚Äù"
2,I used to say that to people when it was snowing or a hurricane and I was impatiently waiting to close early (I‚Äôm talking blizzard or direct hit hurricane). Customers would say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre making you work in this! When are you closing?‚Äù And I would look them directly in the eye and say ‚Äúwhen people stop coming in‚Äù. They usually didn‚Äôt get it üôÑ
3,I would have loved to see how her bridesmaid‚Äôs attempt to fix the cake would look if they didn‚Äôt drop it.
4,"Wow, how does that lady get on flights with balls of steel like that? To demand a product before she's supposed to get it *and* still ask for the percentage off and store cash? Wow. "
5,Me too. She also left a bad review claiming we left ‚Äústicks‚Äù in the cake. They were the dowels that held the cake together. 
6,The dad with baloon rain had the best idea in given situation.
7,YOU DIDN'T SHOP HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
8,"Not only do I not believe she‚Äôs a cake decorator, I don‚Äôt even think she‚Äôs seen any of those tv shows about cakes.  "
9,"Am I the only one that kinda hopes they sell out before she gets there for the camera? I mean it is Black Friday. Depending on when the store opens for their sale, those cameras could fly off the shelf."
10,Did you tell the employee about this to make sure her credit card wasn‚Äôt stolen?
11,Your boss made you open on christmas for *one* customer?
12,Those gracious customers are the real MVPs
13,"The jokes that were made after my husband had his leg amputated would have probably horrified most.

We had a pirate themed goodbye/good riddance party for it, that involved a ‚Äúguess the weight‚Äù 50/50 that the surgeon was more than happy to play along with, he even made sure there was a scale in the OR.

Probably the best was with my nephew though. He and my brother were living with us at the time, he was about 3. To young to understand but old enough to realize uncle‚Äôs leg fell off. My husband told him he dropped it and couldn‚Äôt find it. That poor kid looked for Uncle‚Äôs leg for days. Telling him what really happened would have been much more traumatic and he quite enjoyed his game of hide and seek. 

Some people have a pretty dark sense of humour, and use it to cope with unpleasant situations. My family falls into that category."
14,State I live in ID doesn‚Äôt expire for 50(!) years.  Seriously my ID is good until 2054.  Every once in awhile someone comes in with an ID card so old that none of the cashiers know it‚Äôs real.
15,Always nice when they have no one to blame but themselves!
16,Should've gone to Specsavers
17,"This reminds me of this time a guy came to rent a car with us years ago - I asked him for his driver license and he gave me one that expired eight years prior.  He said, ""oops wrong one"" and handed me another one that expired four years prior.  ""Oh jeez sorry"" he said and handed me a folded up piece of paper with a photocopy of a license, but from a different state.  I told him we can't accept photocopies, and even if we did, the copied license expired two years ago."
18,"&gt;""I need a SIX! SIX! SIX!"" then he starts gesturing on his fingers the number six.

Maybe he was trying to summon the dark lord?"
19,"How to fall down the stairs:

* Step 1
* Step 2
* Step 4
* Step 7
* Step 12
* Step 19
* Step 28"
20,"‚ÄúThe more you walk in it, the sooner \*notices wheelchair\* I‚Äôll realize that I am completely and totally oblivious today, sorry about that.  Retail autopilot got me again.‚Äù

Heh.  Every wheelchair-bound person I‚Äôve ever met has seen those kinds of slip-ups as the person not noticing that they‚Äôre disabled in a *good* way."
21,"When I used to work at an outdoor retailer in Chicago, a huge blizzard hit us overnight and I was supposed to open the next day. Everyone in the city was advised not to leave their homes, but my manager called me around 11 and said we were going to be open because ""we sell gloves"". I was so mad"
22,You don't get paid holiday pay? WTF that seems so wrong. 
23,"Maybe I‚Äôve watched one too many old detective movies, but part of me is seriously wondering if she has anything stashed inside the bag of rice that she was trying to get past you. I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why anyone would want an open bag of rice! "
24,My boss was very much a pushover. 
25,"I still don‚Äôt understand people who use makeup on display, especially lip products ü§¢"
26,"This reminds me of the story about the dude who was playing football, and then something happened with him and another guy, and he said ""are you fucking sorry"" in an attempt to say ""are you okay"" and ""I'm fucking sorry"" at the same time."
27,"I've heard that money doesn't change people, it just makes them more of who they already are."
28,"Reminds me of a time someone tried to return a 10 year old broken weed eater at my store and when I obviously didn't he hit me with a, ""You need to learn to respect your customers!"" So I snapped back, ""Sir, you're returning. You're the exact opposite of a customer."" "
29,Unfortunately she seemed in a hurry to get out of the store with cheeks as red as her newly polished lips.
30,That's nuts! Let's hope they don't come back a 4th time
31,"While getting change for my cashier's drawer today, I heard a customer in line say ""Personally, I don't think any of you should be open today. It's disgusting."" Yea? Then why are you shopping?"
32,"EXACTLY AND NOW YOU'RE ALSO LOSING MY RETURN TOO, YOU'LL BE OUT OF BUSINESS SOON!"
33,TIL some states have 50-year IDs...
34,This lady was so cool about the whole thing. She even joked about how her son makes comments about pushing her down a flight of stairs üò≠üòÇ 
35,Honestly probably more memorable than just balloons. I‚Äôd definitely offer that as an alternative to regular balloons. Bonus points if they have a offer a easy system to do this with
36,I got diabetes from this post 
37,"My parents owned a family bussiness that basically was the same as ""shindig town"" when I was growing up. 

Helium has so many other uses and it's so finite to be used in balloons. Its nessesary for medical procedures and many other industries. Helium shortages are much more damaging than just some kid not having balloons

We found so many alternatives to making them float and also look good. Arches and columns dont neeed that much helium if any. Plus theres alternative mixes of air to helium that use less helium and make the balloons as filled and still float (just not as long). 

"
38,I want to do this if I ever get rich. 
39,"i like to give a nice slight smile and and very sincere thank you after ""I'm not coming back"""
40,The world has a limited and dwindling supply of He. At least until we get reliable fusion power. 
41,this guy has a real problem with renewing his license
42,Ah stories like this make me not miss working in retail in the slightest.
