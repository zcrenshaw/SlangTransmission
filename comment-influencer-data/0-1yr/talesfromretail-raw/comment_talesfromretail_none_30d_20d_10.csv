0,That became my personal rule after I got hit by a short change artist at a store I worked at. We were shorthanded during a Thanksgiving rush and I was sick as a dog. Didn't realize what had happened until about 15 minutes later. That was the only time I got caught out.
1,Yeah sometimes you have to be curt to help them understand how unreasonable they're being! But 95% of the time they aren't able to own up to their own mistakes.
2,I work at orange. It happens constantly especially with vermiziom phones. They send them out in orange company’s boxes with brown’s label to return it. Someone there is trolling. Edit: more description
3,"Tbh me too, we change stuff quite often
They probably were just quite similair and not the exact same pair"
4,I worked for Shipping Company Orange (well their Blue portion of the company) and we got that all the time.
5,They have them in many supermarkets in the UK. Wish granted!
6,“Fewer than 12 items” is less clunky.
7,Absolutely right. What ISNT healthy is how retail and service workers are expected to take abuse with a smile.
8,Your manager is terrible. You did exactly the right thing. I'm sorry this happened to you and that you have such an unsympathetic manager.
9,"Yes, this is what I meant too."
10,Nice! Thanks for the explanation.
11,"I worked at a grocery store, and we had a $1 discount cart in the front of the store. We're talking cheap bargain items like Play-Doh or offbrand bath bombs. Customers would use it as a place to deposit things they picked up and changed their mind about, so when an item didn't scan, we would have to do a price check on it. People would tell us all the time ""You don't have to price check it, it was in the discount cart"", and we would have to explain that other customers would sometimes abandoned their unwanted items in the cart regardless of the price. 

One woman was trying to buy four chocolate bars that were clearly over $1 each (you know, the really fancy ones), and when my coworker explained this to her, she told us that it was ridiculous to think that anyone would abandon their unwanted items at the front of the store and she should get them for $1. 

I'm not sure anyone actually bought $1 items from the cart. I think most people just took items that were mistakenly placed up there and threw a fit when they found out the truth. That cart caused more problems than it was worth for both the customers and the employees."

13,Lol I bet someone out there has tried this before
14,"Exactly, I think I had a lady come in and buy a few candy bars that was MAYBE $6 and she gave me a $100.
It’s just rude to an extent, but if they do it and I gotta call a manager to get me more bills, they better not rolls their eyes at me. I’m not the one that wanted to break a 100 dollar bill."
15,"It's sad that an attitude towards something can negatively effect something that can really help people.

Though kids shouldn't be doing either! Wait until your an adult to screw up your life ;)"
16,Fewer people are smoking thanks to the prices but unfortunately it has lead to a huge increase in robberies of convenience stores because of it.
17,i see a few people felt insulted by my comment. rotflmao.
18,"It's been said a few times in this thread, but Canada. cigarettes and alcohol are taxed pretty high here. I don't smoke though, so I can't relate too much."
19,"It is 10%? I wasn’t quite sure, but that makes sense seeing as the last increase was nearly 3 dollars a pack. I have seen lots of people make the switch to vaping as a result."
20,"Yup. I used to pay 60¢ a pack (USD).

So glad I quit decades ago.
I don't know how people afford them now. More expensive than a dinner."
21,"Jezus would stop smoking too, at those prices."
22,"That's fucked mate across the ditch the cheapest pack at the moment is about $AUD22 for a 20 pack, however prices go up every few weeks"
23,Our stock room is mostly where the extra fixtures and shelves go now. Very little actual stock.
24,"The shopping cart handle has more bacteria on it than that steak.  I don't think you understand how little risk there is of cross contamination from touching a piece of beef.  Unless the meat department is in serious violation of the health code, there should be zero reason to freak out about touching a raw piece of steak."
25,"""How delusional and self important are some of these people? ""   Oooh, I can answer that one!  VERY!"
26,The company I work for allows returns from years ago. It's annoying and I hate it. They are changing it starting September but it's still a generous 180 days... And anything prior to the change can still be returned basically forever.
27,We don’t sell any but usually like 15-50 a pack.
28,"""Would you like to see the inside of it?"""
29,It used to be 250 cigarettes (a carton and a half) but now it’s only about 25. You pay less for a carton of cigarettes in Bali than you do for one pack here.
30,I thought this was r/Jokes and I kept waiting for a punchline
31,"""I'll check and see if we have any of those microwaves in the back.""  
""You BETTER have one."""
32,"I loved toying with people who did that.
Them: I only have 10 dollars. But I need this. 
Me: well the bathrooms needs cleaning. That should be worth 8 bucks an hour dude.. 
They always looked at me like I was nuts."
33,"The idea is to tax them to the point where people don't buy them.  It doesn't seem to stop people already addicted, but it has certainly reduced the rate young people pick them up at.  They're expensive enough that it's more economical for people who only smoke at parties to buy a $80 vape and have saved money within a month."
34,"There's a guy I went to high school with who recently posted about how he's trying to lose weight. His solution? He mentioned he was going to take up smoking those candy flavoured vapes instead of eating candy and other junk food.

I was like, uhhhhh what? So dumb."
35,"Yep, I'm sure everyone has had that experience.  But the difference is the salesperson *offered* to check."
36,"Yup. I smoked cigs for 8 years. It took me 2 vaping attempts to actually quit. The secret for smokers is finding a juice that tastes like your favorite cig. And NiC Salts. Those 12mg will not cut it at first for most people. I started at 50mg salts. Worked down to 20, now I just use whatever, nicotine or not."
37,Here they have 10 packs. I suppose it's primarily aimed at the individual who lives on zeroing their weekly wages.
