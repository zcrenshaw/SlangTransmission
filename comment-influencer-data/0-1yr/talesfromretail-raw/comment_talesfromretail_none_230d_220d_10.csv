Who am I kidding customers don't read"
1,Breaking Sad
2,"Everyone's happy, I guess? 

r/stupidtax

"
3,"""customer"", they keep using that word, I don't think it means what they think it means"
4,What about customers who bring back the trucks with all the gas gone after leaving with a full tank and being explicitly told they will get charged for not returning the truck with a full tank and start screaming they will call the cops on your for stealing their money?  Those were always the ones who got me this worked up. 
5,"&gt;Being brilliant can make you dumb sometimes. 

Word! I once worked with a man who had 2 PhDs. One in physics and one in chemistry. He was brilliant but had NO common sense. I had to check on him constantly because he would get himself into dangerous situations because he didn't use that fine mind of his. Oh, and he looked down on me because I wasn't ""educated"" like he was."
6,"Why would that even be acceptable? Even if you're ""testing it out"", can you not buy the one you just tested? Jeez, some people are weird"
7,"While the title is good advice, the real info here is:

**Overfill shutoff may not engage below zero degrees F**

Will definitely spread the word. Thanks."
8,"""Mmm. Human water for my hu-man family counterparts..err...I mean family members."""
9,"I worked a few seasons at an outdoor skating rink just a few minutes away from a large shopping center and we had a similar rule for kids under 12 or 13. We're supposed to call 911 if we notice unsupervised kids so they can come and watch out for the kids and talk to the parents when they pick the kids up. 

The police would make routine stops by on their patrols and one had just shown up and come into the warming house to check in with me as we watched a car pull over on the side of the road, not even into the parking lot, and three kids get out, ages 7 to 10 and they drive off. The kids head out onto the ice, they didn't even have skates or sticks or anything. The officer ran out and tried to wave the car down but they either didn't notice or just ignored him. 

Fortunately the kids knew the moms cell number so the officer radios in and someone calls a few times in a row, no answer. Left a message, finally, saying if they didn't call or come back in five minutes they'd be taking the kids to the station. Nothing, so the officer loads the kids in and leaves. 

About two hours later the car pulls into the parking lot and starts honking, presumably to get the kids attention. When they don't come she angrily comes into the building and asking me where her kids are like it's my fault. So I told her about the age rule and the officer. So she calls the police and the officer brings the kids back and, fortunately for her, just gives her a warning and she leaves. 

A few days later I'm working again. I didn't see her drop the kids off but I then see and recognize the kids out on the ice and go talk to them. They say that she had dropped them off, again, to go run more errands. So I have them come inside and call our police number and it was the same officer as before that showed up to get the kids. He said she'll have to come to them, this time, to pick up her kids and that they'd be pressing charges or giving her a fine or something. 

An hour or so later she comes back and does the honking thing again. Again she angrily comes inside trying to blame me for her kids not being there. I tell her to call and find out what to do next but she keeps yelling at me so I'm the one that calls. The officer comes back and tells her she has to drive to the station to do a report and get her kids. She refuses and demands they bring the kids to our location. It ended with him putting her in his squad car. 

No one came for the car before my shift was done but it was gone the next day. Not sure what happened to her or the kids but I didn't see them again in the last few weeks of the season. "
10,She's lucky she didn't get arrested because what she did could be considered child abandonment in some jurisdictions. Especially taking into account her response when you asked her to retrieve her kids.
11,So she was driving without a license as well?
12,I’m really impressed that she ended up smiling and basically admitting she was the one who was at fault 
13,Baseline assumption is *the other person wants to cheat you*.
14,"They don't read, or pay attention in general. And some just don't care. 

I worked at a fuel kiosk for a few years, and one day we had to rope off the whole station due to the wrong fuel types getting put into the wrong tanks (diesel poured into unleaded, vise versa kinda situation) - we used yellow caution tape, tons of orange cones, had printed and laminated signs put on all the pumps in front of the card readers, AND bags in every pump handle - Every. Single. One.

And I still had to be paid for a 10 hour shift of standing out there, walking up to the idiot  who pulled up to a pump and tried putting their card in - moving the sign to do so."
15,"I call it a ""fun pass"" no pass no fun. Then I say ""this isn't about age verification I'm sure you're old enough its about compliance... more mine than yours"". 
If they don't drop it then I tell them ""sorry. You're messing with my bread and butter"". This final statement ends the conversation. We all know not to mess with someone's ""bread and butter"". Nic fit or not that's sacred. Saying ""its my job"" is seen as whining and opens you for argument everytime."
16,"I knew someone who, repeatedly, opened up product to examine it and then put that back to pick up a new box because ""that one had been opened""... no, these weren't gifts.

No, I didn't kill them (sorry retail people). "
17,"Well wrote, Not-Donna.  I want to thank you for keeping it simple.  So many people backload a ton of unnecessary background info we don't need.  I usually skip the first paragraph of posts in this sub.  They're good people, I appreciate them sharing their stories, but still."
18,"The tactic I think I think works the best is to have an employee sitting in a nice warm cozy store looking out the window or at cameras ... And every time someone leaves their pump unattended, turn it off."
19,"Back when I worked at a department store in Hugh school a woman left her one year old in a changing room whilst she went to the other end of the store.
There was this kid sitting on the floor of the change room crying and everyone was asking me what to do since I had been there the longest but since it was a Saturday all the staff members (except for the manager who was out the back) were teenagers that were not equipped to deal with the situation. The mother eventually comes back with more clothes to try on saying ""sorry, sorry."" But then 20 minutes later leaves her kid in a trolley in the line for the register, once again she went to the other end of the store. The kid is crying again and there are three women in line trying to calm him down and seeming concerned looking around for the mother. She came back again ""oh sorry sorry"" and I can tell you the three women (who I'm pretty sure we're mothers themselves) absolutely gave it to her. 

Also, last year a women left her kid in her car to come into the pharmacy I work in, in the middle of the Australian Summer mind you, which the cops are constantly telling people not to do. She only went back and got her kid because another woman saw her do it and wouldn't stop following her around the store and yelling at her until she went and got her kid 

Honestly people like this should just not have kids or not go shopping. "
20,"I may be weird, but I love the taste of water that comes from one of those orange coolers.  I'm a sucker for some garden hose water in the summer too.  Mmmm… BPAs."
21,"“Cart full of drug...stuff (cough drops)? I don’t know. I don’t do/make all the drugs”

Had me laughing way harder than I should have been. "
22,"Oh ya I should have included this: we got this detailed description of how he had to buy a funnel and, even then, had a hard time pumping without spilling all over. *That was a hint dude!*"
23,"I had a friend in high school who was incredibly brilliant...academically. They were taking college level math courses as a freshmen, on honor roll, won numerous mathematics and science awards.

But outside of academics he was somewhat hopeless. For example: dude could not navigate to save his damn life. This was in the flip phone era, so he couldn’t even just consult an app. 

One time, we were giving him and some other classmates a ride home. When we asked for directions to his house, he got so confused and unable to remember how to get home we ended up just calling his mom for the address. Turns out, we were only a few streets away. "
24,"seriously. If more cashiers just said ""This has nothing to do with you, I'm just complying with state laws and our liquor/tobacco license"" 

probably nothing would change. People are fickle "
25,"We used to have a policy that you had to bring back the gas receipt to prove you filled it up. What that didn't prove, however, that they filled it up all the way, meaning occasionally we would get people coming back saying they had to put in more than they used, as the previous person didn't fill up, and demanding compensation. "
26,He sounds classy. I'm surprised that he didn't just get her a can of febreeze. 
27,"She probably was arrested, hence how she lost custody of her kids. "
28,Here is a free one just for you... ahem. All the drugs.
29,"In a similar vein, I've had so many people today remember to mention a discount or bring up a pricing problem AFTER they have already accepted the total. You accepted it! You agreed it was the right amount! WHY DON'T Y'ALL READ?!? thankfully though I can just send them to customer service so I don't have to mess with it, but it's still frustrating."
30,Old women are sometimes the worst. I’ve actually had to ban one from my store.
31,"The toasting of the bread wouldn't bother me much, I would have found it hilarious. Sure, the customer might be nuts, but it's better than the nutjobs who are yelling at me.

Buying a different toaster than the one he opened is what would piss me off, and your manager trying to write you up for saying no is ridiculous."
32,She should have lost custody.  You don't leave one under 10 kid in charge of a younger kid.  Anything could have happened to them.  Good on your manager for calling the police.  That woman didn't need kids.
33,Thank you. I'm glad that at least one company doesn't expect me and all the other customers to finance this woman's attempted fraud. 
34,"One time I had a customer have an “I guess I gotta to now” moment.

(I work at a denim retailer)

He came in and someone greeted him and asked if he needed help finding something. They went to the straight leg jeans section and got him a couple pair. The customer decided to look around a bit before trying them on (not unusual). He moseyed around for a while looking at this and that. Then he got near the front of the store. 

Our sensor alarm is pretty sensitive and went off when he was maybe 4 feet away. As soon as the alarm sounded he took off out the door and ran across the parking lot to his car!

We just all stared after him. Was this his plan all along? Was he just super spooked and is going to be real embarrassed later?? We’re the jeans even the right size???

The association who helped him gave a very weak “Have a nice day...” "
35,I love how many times you say “all the drugs”.
36,Those people need to be sterilized 
37,"If a customer is not a customer, but says they are a customer, tell them this:

&amp;#x200B;

You have not bought anything. Therefore, you are not a customer. Off you fuck."
38,"That's not illegal in most places in the US - you just need to be able to produce it within 24 hours (or when you go to court).  That being said, if you're in any kind of other trouble (pulled over for a violation), then you will likely be in for more issues if you don't have it in your possession..."
39,You'd think that she would be smart enough after the first warning.... Some people are too dumb to have kids
