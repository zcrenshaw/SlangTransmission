0,"Why do people insist on trying to double-down on bluffs that are repeatedly called out and sandbagged? You don't have the charisma or intelligence to get it the first time, stop mashing the bluff prompt!"
1,What a twist.  Based on the title I thought some jerk was going to try to return a broken item to your store that you didn't even sell.
2,He sounds like a toddler...
3,The only thing to do with dodgy customers is serve the hell out of them !
4,"She hit all the tick marks. Stupidity, ignorance, unwillingness to learn, deliberately causing inconvenience and/or property damage. We've got ourselves a retail customer"
5,"I never understood why customers complain when something was cheaper a few days ago, like bruh prices can go up."
6,"Don't you wish you could have told her, ""Get the fuck in the back of the line!"""
7,Having worked in a mall I can tell you that the number for mall security should be posted next to each and every phone
8,"Hood up is almost a guaranteed bad sign at any retail establishment, especially when it’s already warm out/summer.   Couple that with sunglasses and you can about bet on it that you’re about to get robbed or shoplifting is about to happen.

On a side note, what’s the deal with 20 something year olds wearing winter beanies and full hoodies when IT IS SUMMER AND 100 Degrees out!?!    I do not understand this.   How can that be comfortable?!  Is it “because of fashion?!”"
9,"I got a write up once cause a lady was leaving and pushing on the door instead of pulling it and getting angry that it wasn’t working even through the door said pull. So I say verbatim, “it’s a push door, just push. Have a nice night.”  Apparently I offended her enough to call and talk to the store manager. He pulled me in the office and wrote me up for it. Thanks guitar center."
10,Looks like a nutjob. Who spends that much on items just in case they need them?
11,"With people like this, I would like to face-palm them."
12,"
People who deal with the public should be paid extra, not less..."
13,"""Gee, let's rob a gun store where there are cameras, the employees are most likely armed, and the customers are as well.""

Genius level thinking there."
14,"Plot twist, it was a fraudulent order."
15,"I’m crazy non-confrontational, so the most I would have done is said firmly “Ma’am, you’re old enough to understand what a line is for, now please get in line and wait your turn.”"
16,I used to work as a cashier and this was a very common problem at my place of work too. People would pay with huge bills for the smallest amounts. It was almost an everyday thing. Made me hate my job even more.
17,Right! And what better service to give than to be ready at any second to answer any questions she might have about the merchandise..............................
18,"Thank you for that last comment. A few times I have been the one who didn't clearly read a sign, and it's my own fault. And true, on more than one occasion, after having apologized and said so, salespeople have done some small thing to help. Don't scream at people. Especially when youare the one in error."
19,"""A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine"" will always be my favorite come back in this situation"
20,"&gt;&gt; toddler... 

Or a surgeon...."
21,It was a return customer thankfully! I had just spent the previous 3 days working with him to verify the order.
22,Try pulling that in his office and see how far it goes.
23,"I feel bad for both the worker and the customer; the worker because they had to put up with this, and the customer because they had to do basic math, which is obviously too hard for them."
24,Left... with her stolen bike.
25,"'Should' being the key word. I agree, but it wasn't. We were also a flagship store with our own in-house security but the only ones in at the time were the undercover guys. It was very rare that we reached out to mall security."
26,"See, a smarter person would play along when their bluff was called, saying something like, “Just testing ya.” A little less annoying for the employee (because they don’t have to keep telling the customer they’re wrong), and the customer gets to save face by pretending it was a joke. Really, you look a lot less stupid if you play it off as a bad joke than if you continue to argue an obviously incorrect point. 

An even smarter person would have researched a little before trying this, and know that this is a new store, and thereby craft a less obviously stupid bluff. 

But the smartest would know that trying to pull this off is stupid in the first place, and not do it. If you really want to cheat the store, there are far more effective and less obvious ways of doing it."
27,"&gt;IM A DOCTOR, IM TIRED, I WANT ICECREAM.

And I want a pony, but life is full of disappointments."
28,Alcohol is a helluva drug.
29,"Looks like I left my wallet at home, guess that MRI is free, right?"
30,In this case the customer is not wrong. Lucky she didn’t get upset and complain about you guys.
31,"The entire store was told at a meeting the next day that was called to discuss the situation with corporate security. He was arrested at his house a few hours later and spent some time in jail. 

They had just had a law suite filed against them because they did not take a threat seriously and an employee at another store was attacked in the parking lot by a customer over a situation that was similar to this one. They were not messing around this time and took all threats seriously."
32,"Put the old one under the counter. “Drop” the new one while ringing and produce the old one. Maybe? 

I hate retail."
