0,"That is beyond ridiculous that you got written up - not once but twice! - when you absolutely did nothing wrong. I would have refused to sign as well.

I hope that lady gets whatever karma is coming to her. Sounds like she enjoys ruining other people's lives."
1,"&gt;I booked it to my fucking car. Sprinting and holding a 55 inch TV over my head and slapped the back of my car door shut and ran back inside.    

[Actual footage of you :&gt;](https://imgur.com/gallery/1U7GRyn)"
2,"I love the last line.

""Yes"", meaning  ""yes, you have correctly assessed this situation and nothing about it is going to change anytime soon."""
3,"I'm glad she laughed it off and there was a happy ending, it could have gone much worse!"
4,"Here’s hoping a week later she sat bolt upright at 3am and said, “....Why TF did I say he could only wear cotton...” "
5,"Knitting elitism is fucking annoying, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. This is a pretty serious fail in the manager's part and shouldn't be overlooked.

Also, I'm curious where you're from. I've never heard patterns referred to as recipes, but it makes total sense and I kinda like it. Cooking up a yarn project!

Anyway, hope that bitch gets something coming to her"
6,Oh yeah!!! Her personality was such that she didn’t take life so seriously so I got lucky and she just laughed it off lol. She continued shopping there for like 10 years afterward. In fact years later I found out that she was a bartender at a local dive bar and so I went in there a few times with the meat guys for drinks. I would give her a fat tip lol 
7,She was buying a backpack. Couldn’t put her shampoo in that? Geez. 
8,"&gt;a fat tip 

You really don't learn, do you?"
9,"&gt; I've been in retail for almost four tears    


That sounds about right...   
And that situation warrants a call to the Police. Throwing a phone at someone is assault. "
10,I have honestly lost track if the number of times I have had to tell a parent to remove their child from our display/freezer/backstage area for their childs safety. It rarely seems to bother the parent. I would bet my wage that they’d suddenly be interested when their kid smacks their skull off a metal shelf.
11,Yes. If i was screaming.
12,"Technically, that day *you* were the customer and he was just the idiot who let a really good deal sprint past under his nose. Enjoy your new tv :)"
13,You work retail.  You're undoubtedly screaming on the inside.   
14,"&gt;Sally: I have to make it very clear that he has a skin condition and can only wear 100% cotton

Fucking LOST it right there. Thank you OP, I needed a good laugh today."
15,I'd be looking for a new job. Sounds like they want to get rid of him for some unrelated reason. 
16,How do you get so far in owning chickens and not know that they don't do milk??? lmao. surely you'd at least look up how to take care of chicks and notice a conspicuous lack of milk
17,"Why is this guy so busy that he couldn't wait until you were done?? Especially when he could've asked for what he was looking for when he got there. 

Of course, very possible that he thought you were just avoiding customers in the restroom, because retail workers aren't humans with bladders or anything. "
18,This is what blew my mind the most.
19,"Wait a moment. Your mother owns the store, and a manager at this store was insulting you and let a sizable theft happen right under her nose, and you don't know what to do with that info? Just tell your mother what happened! This manager just cost your family money through sheer arrogance. "
20,"I could understand a manager saying ""Come to me and let me take care of situations like this in the future"", but to write you up for following store policy is ridiculous."
21,"Yeah, I dunno what to do with the info. The owner (my mother) is thinking of selling soon anyway and I don’t wanna stir up drama or risk getting her job if she’s replaced. 

And I’m Scandinavian XD I just directly translated the word we use here, it’s the same for crafts and cooking! "
22,"I had a mom like this once. I work at a farm store, and we had a bunch of tanks with baby chicks in them. The tanks are completely surrounded by gates that say employees only, and do not touch the chickens. 
The mother saw the signs, walked around to the opening gate, unlatched the gate, let her child in and put her kid inside on of the tanks so he could play with the baby chicks. He sat/stepped on and killed around 30. When we saw what was going on we removed her from the tanks immediately. The mom honestly said about her child KILLING 30 baby chicks that, ""I dont see what the big deal is, they're just chickens"". "
23,"&gt;customer berated me over the phone for ruining her marriage

The marriage she was leaving?  With the husband she was cheating on, and apparently screwing over?  You ruined THAT marriage?   Good!   

How did they write you up twice for the same thing?!  You shouldn't have been written up once, but twice?  "
24,"He thought it was hilarious. But if he publicly admitted it, id have to be written up."
25,"You're the owner's daughter, shouldn't you report said behavior?"
26,LOL oh no. Apparently I didn’t learn :(((
27,LOL!! What. A. Tool!
28,"Saw a dumbest criminals shown once where a guy kept ramming a door and screaming at the employee behind bullet proof glass (who he just tried to rob at gunpoint, while alarms are going off and police sirens are heard getting closer) to unlock the door.

Just as you hear the cop cars screech to a stop outside the guy tosses his gun on a counter and gets face down on the ground with his hands behind his back.  The cops come in with weapons drawn and with no trouble opening the door since it wasn't locked, it just opened inward instead of out.

If the guy had once tried to pull on the door instead of pushing it and running into it hard enough to bounce back to the ground he would have been gone long before the police showed up."
29,Chances are she is exactly the reason your company has that policy.
30,"I had a lady like that — tried to bitch me out over the phone because I didn’t give her the normal members-only deal of buy 3 get one free on her full-priced items. Except she only bought sale items and we don’t stack discounts. We are very clear about that. 

Her response was a simple, “oh” before hanging up on me. "
31,"Yep, I'm sure this woman would be the first to try and sue the store if the bike came apart while he was riding it! We're not telling you to stop something for the fun of it!"
32,Yeah. Maybe she was grieving or something and wasn't thinking straight. Hopefully she told her friend about the call and then they realized together and had a shared moment of comedic relief. 
33,"I don't get his logic, if he signed up for the access pass he would pay $5, but save $10.40 on the hat, so he would get a $5.40 discount, making the hat $46.60, just $1.60 more than he wanted to pay."
34,"Jeez OP, how dare you take ciggy sales and elevate them to the level of rocket surgery. The nerve of you! /s"
