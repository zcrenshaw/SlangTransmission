0,"Sounds like they just didn't want to deal with it. Shame on them. Corporate might have something to say eventually, if they catch it."
1,Well....did you get his number?!
2,"&gt; What do people think ""you're getting this for free"" means? that i'm secretly charging you and pocketing the cash? 

Yes. Yes they do."
3,"You‚Äôre not in the wrong here at all, but this scenario is exactly why I just ask them if they‚Äôre apart of the loyalty program."
4,"Also, you know this isn‚Äôt the US because if we tried to ask somebody to come with us because they‚Äôre suspected of shoplifting, we‚Äôd get an earful about how they have rights or something"
5,How about we set up in your yard?  Would that be convenient for you?
6,My girlfriend has ushers and has low enough vision that she uses a white cane everywhere except in one of our apartments. She still gets asked this question like once a week. I know how frustrating it can be but all you can do it be confidant and comfortable with yourself.
7,Linda is bananas. B A N A N A S.
8,I also must know. Or did he tell you that he has a girlfriend?
9,I hope the manager had to put in an override so it's his ass and not OP's if they do
10,"&gt; cashier running after him

Yep not the US."
11,But do you have Mario for the Xbox?
12,Honestly i like how she knew she would be laughed at afterwards.
13,"I had a situation where I did flex my education - I work part time at a hardware store to help fund uni living costs. I was pushing trolleys around in the car park one weekend, and a woman with two children stopped to look at me. I distinctly heard her say 'see (child' s name), this is why you have to work hard in school, so you get a proper job instead of this'. Kid couldn't have been more than 10. I made eye contact and told her that I'm studying for a masters, and I'm only here because I want to be financially independent. She was taken aback but just said 'oh' and walked off. A person's job is generally not an indication of their intelligence level (with obvious exceptions like surgeons)."
14,"&gt; 10‚Ç¨

Also not the U.S."
15,Are you sure it was a decade ago?  I mean there might be an extra month in there somewhere....
16,Who gives a crap about the BBB?
17,Someone complained about 1 cent to me yesterday üôÇ
18,"&gt;police is there in time

Also not the U.S."
19,if only they had enough brain power to realize they‚Äôd get the receipt and immediately know what happened
20,I‚Äôm sorry. All sold out. But I did find one copy of God of War for the Gameboy Advance. Would you like that?
21,"Ice cold.  I also work in a craft store, and it's pretty much a motto that ""Craft people are fucking crazy.""  

I don't know why or how and from this site it's not just my location, but...I've worked retail for most of my life and in just 10 months I have more insane stories than at the rest of my jobs put together.  Threats, screaming, obvious drug addiction, stupidity...It's baffling."
22,"God I despised it when angry people would give you some arbitrary time limit for whatever stupid thing they wanted you to do. As if it actually makes you go ‚ÄúGee, I better work faster now because Random Man told me it better be done when he checks his credit card statement tomorrow!!‚Äù

There was one time where my store was unusually busy and I was already taking a customer somewhere when this other woman stops me and tells me she needs help with something. Yeah, you and everyone else right now lady. I tried to apologetically tell her I‚Äôd be back to help her as soon as I finished with the other customer, and that I would also radio my coworkers that she needed help so whoever was done first could come help her, but she wasn‚Äôt having it. She rolled her eyes and had this look of utter contempt on her face. She looked square at me and said with SO much disgust,‚ÄúYou have 30 seconds.‚Äù  

This all occurred while I was in motion taking a customer somewhere but that stopped me in my tracks while I processed how rude it was. I started back up walking, slowly now, and radioed my coworkers that someone REALLY needed help, trying to convey with my tone that she was being a bitch. No reply, obviously, because they were all helping other customers. When I finished with my original customer, which in reality was probably less than 30 seconds later, I went back to help the bitchy lady but she was gone. Guess my 30 seconds was up ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø

Still keeps me up at night knowing that I lost that Very Busy Lady‚Äôs $15 sale /s."
23,B has a point.  They seem to be the type of people that would come back later and blame you for the soiled bag.  Totally agree with B on this and I think he will be an amazing history teacher. :)
24,How about in your house? That way you wont have to walk as far from the market to your kitchen.
25,That response was perfect.
26,"Freakin' HAY. SHE BROUGHT IN A BANK STATEMENT!? HOLY CARP!

At least your manager was able to get her OUT."
27,"I know the answer! Old people who don't know Yelp! (yes, I know, same difference)"
28,"It sounded like she was trying to be supportive rather than condescending, but that might just be how I‚Äôm reading it."
29,"Never did an override. But I‚Äôm not working there anymore, so I don‚Äôt really care lol"
30,He wants a human with compassion? Is he planning to plead with the cashier over expired coupons?
31,"Similar situation happened to my friend. He was playing guitar at a wedding with a girl he'd never met playing piano. 

Friend: ""Hey, where are you planning on sitting so we can get up when we need to play?""
Girl: ""Ugh. I have a boyfriend""
Friend: ""..."""
32,Bruh I bust out the fucking highlighters and mark it for them on their receipt so they can see in BIG YELLOW STRIPES that they need to re-learn how to listen.
33,But I'm not hungry! You're horrible at your job!
34,Unfortunately where I work were are specially told told ask for the phone number to see if they are apart of the loyalty program. I have yet to ask it this way.  I still ask if your artist of the rewards program.
35,If I‚Äôm feeling extra when  I print up the receipt I look at it with them after and immediately turn into a 2nd grade teacher ‚Äúsee 2+2 is fourrrrrrrr...‚Äù
36,"I know I should just be comfortable and I normally am. It just hurts to have it called out like this, especially since it was my first time on the register on my own. Was just getting confident with my pace and rate, and then this right to the face"
37,"Yes, I respected it :P"
38,Man.. Talk to your boss... He might cover that parking fee for you..
39,People vent when their whole world is falling apart. I think she just needed someone to listen
40,I've never understood wanting to retain customers like that.
