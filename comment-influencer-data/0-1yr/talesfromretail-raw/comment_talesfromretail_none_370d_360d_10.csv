0,I just feel bad for her poor son! That would be so embarrassing!!
1,Every time anyone ever acted like that to me- they were 100% trying to steal and thought they’d get caught. Lmao 
2,"Not me, but a coworker of mine asked an older woman (ballpark 60-ish) if she needed help. The lady turned to her with an incredulous look on her face and said ""excuse me?!"" so my coworker repeated herself thinking she hasn't heard her. The lady said to her, ""I am an intelligent individual, I don't need help finding something on the shelf. Walk away."" To this day that has been the rudest thing I had ever seen in my retail experience."
3,The way he was acting it's probably something she does a lot. He was already numb to it.
4,"I was about to do my weekly deep clean of the seafood case of a grocery store one night and I had the front windows open. Most of the seafood was already removed from the case except for a few pieces of old, dried out raw fish and crusty shrimp that had fallen through the ice and was sitting on the bottom of the case. I was planning to toss those disgusting scraps into the trash, when this customer comes along and reaches into the open front window of the case and grabs some crusty old seafood scraps and pops them in his mouth and says “Mmmmm... sushi!” I was like WOW. What the f&amp;c$ just happened right now?!"
5,"I worked at a small clothing store. One day my manager went to a meeting and came back with 2 fancy little chocolates. She set them aside in a place where customers can’t access easily so she could help on the register. Well, a woman ducked under a full clothing rack and grabbed the 2 chocolates for her and her husband. My manager turned around as the woman and her husband were eating the chocolates, and told her that those weren’t samples. The lady just said, “Oh. Do you have a napkin for my husband?” It was just funny cause, she had to really try hard to get the chocolates, they were so out of the way. My poor manager was so upset. "
6,"He knew it wasn't a sample from the beginning. No store pushes around samples in a cart with trash, or in a shopping cart period. They're always set up in little sample areas. He just wanted some free eats, and had no shame."
7,"Ok that is absolutely shocking behaviour from your colleague! And the customer didn't help it by not clarifying what said colleague did, would have made a difference to the whole encounter :("
8,I'd like to meet the baby that can lift a 5kg leg of lamb.
9,Don’t you just *love* how dense some people are?
10,"Four cops down the road? 

Sounds like an ABC sting. That’s why they were so insistent, and why she came back with something so ridiculous as showing you a picture on her phone of her ID. 

You passed the test. With flying colors. "
11,Love that he had the gall to demand you come in for a sandwich. Even if you DID get the order wrong how much would that refund have been? Surely not enough to waste your time like that!
12,I also manage a flower section of a retail chain. Yesterday a middle aged man pointed to some cut greens/filler and asked “these will never die right?” I had to clarify that he wasn’t just using a figure of speech.  No. He was genuinely asking if the green cut flowers would live forever. I was like “no they will eventually die just like any other cut flower”. Unbelievable. 
13,"That was my first thought too, especially when she first accused the OP of hovering over her when they weren't even paying attention to her..."
14,"A friend of mine who worked at a hotel in London once sent me a recording from their security cameras that showed a man walk up to one of the flower beds in front of the hotel and straight up eat a flower. He didn't even pick it up and put it in his mouth, he simply bit it, swallowed it and walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll believe anything after this."
15,"I work at a liquor store and we do favors like this for certain vendors or owners. But an average customer? Go fuck yourself.

I would love to see this guy run a business. What a fucking moron."
16,"Used to have a regular who did worse than this back at a ""boutique"" grocery back in the 90's (read: overpriced in general, lots of imported items):

He took advantage of the fact that we were expressly forbidden to tell any customer that we were closing/just closed/closed an hour ago unless they asked, assuming they were already in the store. This guy made a habit of showing up five minutes until close, and remaining for an hour *past* close, every trip (2x/month or so). 

When asked, he said that he knew very well when we closed, and that he came then because he didn't want to have to deal with other shoppers. We ended up just waiting for him to finish in one aisle, then dry-mopping and cleaning it after he had moved on to the next. He was pleasant and all, but this still meant a minimum of one cashier, one bagger, and half of our other closers waiting on him for an hour. The bosses weren't happy about it either, but none of them had the guts to make him stop."
17,"my time in retail really illustrated for me that there are people walking around, fully functional adults, who have no concept of the fact that every store has to first buy the products they are selling to you.

The number of times I heard ""well, $X is better than $0 right?""...well no it's not."
18,"Yikes, that's somehow worse than the silent treatment, lol. The silent treatment made me *feel* like she thought she was better than me. The lady your coworker had expressed as much."
19,"Wow, she's a bitch. That actually sounds like a decent price."
20,She should have just accused her of personal theft which it was and called the cops 
21,"That sweet karma ain't gonna earn itself, Metroidzoid. What if she was posting to /r/TalesFromTheCustomer just then? *Twilight Zone theme *"
22,"Is she the cyclops from the Odyssey? ""Nobody stabbed me!""

Anyway, maybe we should make it a trend that if a customer starts throwing a fit, any nearby employees approach to watch/""help"". An audience of 1 isn't enough? Have 5! Have 10! At what point will you feel some sense of self awareness? Is this enough attention for your antics? "
23,"I think I would have done the same as that man. Sorry ma'am but if you are going to be a bitch, now I really want it. If she was nice about it, I would let her have it but the moment you start yelling or calling names, I turn off mr nice."
24,"Some of the people I work with just don't seem to care in general. Just yesterday I had a manager making a big fuss about me getting on my register and filling out a balloon order for her. So I got off to do it, and not even a minute later she was insisting I get back on the register because we had a line building up. (Which was why I was on the register in the first place...) and on top of that she was trying to interrupt me in the middle of a transaction with a customer. I refused to leave until I'd handed the person I was helping their receipt and then asked what it was she was making a fuss about. "
25,"While I was a barista I once had a girl ask why coffeeshops always charge more for soy/almond milk and I was just standing there like..... have you been to a grocery store and seen the price of normal milk vs alternatives? Like we're not trying to discourage lactose intolerant people and vegans from buying drinks, it just costs more to buy the materials for those drinks. We don't get our ingredients for free. "
26,"I almost exclusively use self check out, i just figured the employee that hung out there was there yo card people for booze and fix the machines when they break down

Never occurred to me they wanted to keep me from stealing, thats probably because i never wanted to steal anything though 

That lady was a thief dude"
27,Oh for sure. A few of my coworkers have gotten busted in the past few years because they sold to someone underage who was sent in by the ABC. I always ID if I have any doubt. 
28,Should have told him it was found in the bathroom
29,"The ""is this ___?"" meme feels so relevant on sale days

No, ma'am, that leather jacket is not part of our activewear sale"
30,Last Christmas I watched two woman almost get in a fist fight over the last two fingerlings.  I've had a grown man scream at me for five minutes because we were out of LOLs.  I've seen people full on run through the store at open to get hatchimals and bust their ass.  Working in the toys section is a trip.  People get way too worked up about overpriced plastic.
31,"That's the thing. A lot of our prices don't seem great, but people fallaciously value their property based on the price they paid for it in new condition. Once you've owned something, it's automatically worth that much less. We pay less because we are a guaranteed buyer for most things within our purview that people have to sell, and because we need to be able to sell these things at some point for a profit in order to keep existing.

&amp;#x200B;

But don't count on our customers to intuit that or know it beforehand. I've had to explain sales tax to multiple customers. \*Sales tax.\* ""Why is the price different than what's on the label?"""
32,"No, you wouldn't. Trust me."
33,And it's probably likely that he's used to his mom having meltdowns like that. No kid should have to suffer being in the care of someone who devolves into a banshee at the slightest inconvenience. 
34,I wonder if she plants a steak in dirt and expects it to grow a cow?
35,"Aaaaand suddenly it all makes sense. Bad leadership rewards bad behaviours, and causes apathy in good colleagues, cuz why should they care when management won't fix up."
36,"B+ for the story, A++ for the censorship."
37,"As soon as they make slick comments about me doing it for them, I being a total smartass and having management kissing my ass to avoid losing me: “Oh absolutely, I’ll do it for you!” Then I jump in and take all their items and void the transaction and start it all over and scan every single item as slow as I possibly can. 

Being great at your job and having management adore you is great because when they complain on you, they just get a shoulder shrug from management and walk away😂😂"
38,"Even if she only paid less than $15, her stupidity cost her a really good deal (a $100 item for about 88% off). I never understand why people purchase an expensive item, and then don't treat it with the care something like that deserves. If I buy jewelry, or a video game, or something costly, it goes straight into either my purse or my trunk, before I go into any other stores. "
