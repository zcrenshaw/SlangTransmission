0,"that's what bothers me about all these posts talking about how spineless the managers are and how they just give into the customer no matter what...Because this is what happens. A customer complains to corporate, and no matter how blatantly wrong they are, the manager gets in trouble for not giving the customer everything they demand."
1,"&gt;Being dyslexic as a cashier isn't always easy

""Dyslexics of the world: UNTIE!""

^^^/s...Don't ^^^get ^^^goofy; ^^^my ^^^daughter's ^^^dyslexic ^^^and ^^^just ^^^received ^^^her ^^^Master's..."
2,Customers with a sense of humor get put on the top of my list every time they come in. I will fight my store manager to get them what they need. Gladiator style. And i will win. Bc I'm still in shape. 
3,Maybe it was the worst price match attempt ever
4,"Had a slightly similar experience with some grandma wanting to buy a laptop for her grandson who was entering university...

She inquired about the price range for an average ''homework and school project'' laptop for a sociology student... to which I responded few hundred dollars ( something that runs microsoft office, basically...)

The grandma then handed me over a little piece of paper with some computer specs on it... obviously not made by her, and obviously not made for ''homework and school project''.

She didn't believe me when I told her that 1) we don't have such beasts in-store, but will see what we can do with custom orders and 2) her 17'' screen top-end gaming laptop (few years ago, back when SSD where new...) will cost her 2 grands atleast."
5,"I was happy to be the manager that denied customers being asshats.  Fortunately, I was never written up for it, but that is also because the managers above me trusted me.  And I also made exceptions to any customers being nice.  I'd like to say that I trained my customers to behave, but, alas, I did not."
6,Fuck your former DM.  Seriously.  
7,I still think that in an ideal world you'd need to take a test before you get a child.
8,"Also, she's an idiot. Buy one get one could get her 4 for 2. But people are weird sometimes."
9,The arm of the law is apparently much longer than you realize...
10,I once opened the grocery store I used to work at to find that a pack of raw ground beef had been hidden behind some chip bags in the chip aisle overnight when the meat section was like a 30 second walk away...it smelled awful and blood got all over the shelf...people are just so freaking lazy and don‚Äôt care about ruining stock. 
11,"Thanks for that. She was hell on wheels. I don‚Äôt think she had ever worked in retail - came from a privileged background and was hired directly into management. 

I wasn‚Äôt the easiest employee (I questioned a lot of things) but I certainly was always polite to customers and tried to follow policy. 

"
12,Various fast food places had 1/3rd pounder burgers but had to give it up because everyone would say that a quarterpounder was more.
13,"""Sir, if you can find it for that price then by all means get it from them; please understand that the price you're suggesting is less than half what it costs the store to \*stock\* the item.""

I've literally had to use that line on multiple customers in the past, who huffed going ""Well Amazon has it for...""

We're not freaking Amazon bucko.  "
14,"The worst part is that if you had done the exchange, you probably still would have gotten in trouble. Gotta love retail."
15,"As a number dyslexic (dyscalculic) myself, I totally understand the misreading of totals to people. There‚Äôs been a couple times that people will look at me funny and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs $1.23? Not ‚Äú2.31?‚Äù I‚Äôve never had someone this bad though! "
16,"I'm excited for SSD prices to go down! It currently looks like some component prices are going down as well, I feel like the whole crypto thing has died down a little."
17,I'm curious about the lizard.
18,"Do they still give high school kids those little ""robot"" babies as a part of their sex-ed classes?  

Maybe every potential parent should have a trial period with one of those that gives them a standardized score, below which you lose your babymaking privileges.  

Maybe it could also spit out free birth control pills and condoms, like a little prophylactic Pez dispenser. "
19,"One store I worked for had a buy one get one half off promo for gift sets before Christmas. Now all of us retail workers know that a lot of the the customers who shop right before Christmas are a special kind of people, but this one made me laugh. He will be customer (C) and I will be Me.


C: sets three gift sets in front of me


Me: ""oh, you know these are buy one get one half off? So you can get another one for half off.""


C: ""no, this one should be free"" (pointing to random gift set)


Me: ""well you can get half off this one, but the promo is buy one get one half off. So you can get another one for half off.""


C: ""but shouldn't this one be free?""


Me: ""well no, They're buy one get one half off, not buy two get one free.""


C: points to the first box. ""Buy one."" Points to the second box. ""Get one half off."" Points to the third box. ""Buy one."" Points again to the second box. ""Get one half off.""


At this point I wanted to laugh and ask him if he had ever gone to bed bath and beyond and tried to use five 20% off coupons to get something for free. I just gave him the retail spiel.


Me: ""I'm sorry, but the system won't allow us to double a promotion for one item.""



Luckily, he was cool with me, but kept saying ""but do you get what I'm saying? Do you get it?"" I agreed with him that I got it, and he was satisfied and bought the gift sets. Thankfully he didn't start a big thing but...really? Come on."
20,"Miss Cleo, is that you?

Because that‚Äôs exactly what happened to me not even two weeks later üòÇ"
21,"Plastic is definitely worse for the environment, and a lot of paper is recycled.  Additionally, trees are replanted in equal or greater numbers than used by paper mills. There are tree-free papers, too."
22,"The company I'm at now pretty much has my back with all decisions, but I've been at companies like the one OP mentioned that had all kinds of rules and if you followed them, you were giving bad customer service. If you didn't follow them, you were breaking company policy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
23,"Yes! I will pretty much give a customer anything they ask for within reason if they 

1. Are nice about it
2. Have a sense of humor about it
Or 
3. Are willing to admit that they are at fault 

At my job we custom make a lot of things, but make sure to inform anyone that if we make something custom for you it is either not returnable, or will be subject to a restocking fee. 

A few weeks ago we had a customer come in about a door he had custom made, and said he needed to order a new one because he had measured incorrectly and the one that came in for him didn‚Äôt fit. He told us he already understood he would be charged a restocking fee to return the old door, and he understood and was okay with that and just wanted one ordered in the correct size. 

We waived the restock fee because he was the first person to *ever* come in and admit that he was the one who made a mistake, rather than yelling at us for producing the wrong thing like everyone else does. "
24,I suddenly feel incomplete because I don't have a large wooden lizard.
25,"The ""With Love"" really ties the whole note together."
26,Nobody tell her about the movie theater trash bags or she will go postal.  
27,"lol, well I'm just glad the queens guard didn't walk in and arrest me"
28,Similar situation happened to me as well. Once found a package of beef short ribs pretty cleverly hidden behind some big boxes of instant rice. The only reason I found it was because of the smell
29,‚ÄúAre you being dyslexic‚Äù like it‚Äôs a verb... I hate ignorant people. 
30,"I once found a pile of (formerly) frozen Chinese food behind the toolboxes in my hardware department.

&amp;#x200B;

It was wonton destruction."
31,You just made me laugh. Thank you for making monday morning a little better
32,"&gt;‚ÄúHey, now that your line is empty you should really work on your people skills.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, though your skull is obviously empty you should really work on *your* people skills.‚Äù"
33,"Nice in theory, difficult in practice. Also one assumes it would be like a drivers test. Easy to do the right thing on a test to pass however judging by the idiots on the road it seems its impossible to do the right thing like use indicators and not run red light long term. "
34,"126gb ssd's go for under $30 on sales now. not bad if you need a boot drive and somewhere to store your word documents.
512gb ssd's go on sale for under $100 now and are great for loading a couple games too.

With game sizes going up though, youll likely never get more than 10 games on a reasonably priced ssd since as data storage becomes cheaper, software tends to get larger."
35,"There are people out there who are just incredibly dense.  I've noticed it's a lot of old people who don't have a grasp on things anymore (like, entering Dementia phase).  They don't know what time it is, where they are half the time, and can't put 2 and 2 together."
36,"In my stint in retail, I had all kinds of clothes try to be returned that not only clearly had been worn, but worn *hard*. 

Like ‚Äúoh no I didn‚Äôt wear this $100 dress, have no idea why it reeks of smoke and alcohol and just a wee bit of vomit ... I‚Äôm bringing it back because of that rip there that clearly didn‚Äôt happen when I fell down drunk while wearing it‚Äù 

Yeah ok, you‚Äôre right. We get dresses rolling off the truck smelling exactly like Friday night stank + Saturday morning regret, all the time. My bad. Here‚Äôs your money, thank you for always being right.

39,"I used to work night fill in a local supermarket, and one night the manager found a whole turkey on the capping above the shelves. It had expired 6 weeks prior, and the plastic wrap was swollen to the point where it was about ready to burst. Working with the precision of a bomb disposal team, we managed to maneuver the turkey out to the bins in the back of the store without rupturing the bag. This was over a decade ago now, and I still can't fathom what would possess a person to put a whole turkey up there where nobody could see it."
