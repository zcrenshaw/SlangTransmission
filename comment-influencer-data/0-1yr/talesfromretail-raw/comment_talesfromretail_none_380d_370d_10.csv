0,"She should be embarrassed for being such a brazen thief.  It‚Äôs not a car, you can‚Äôt take it for a test drive.

Edit: returned the stolen ‚Äúa‚Äù"
1,"The interesting thing was how many women used our inventory as an extension of their jewellery box. 

They‚Äôd come in, select some coordinating diamonds - like necklace, earrings, bracelets, and it would ring up to be high 5 figures, and then they‚Äôd return it a week later saying it didn‚Äôt work with their outfit... except you‚Äôd see the photo of them wearing it at a gala in the paper. "
2,"I sold hemorrhoid cream to my brother in law once. He had already put it on the counter before he noticed it was me. 
He just said, ‚Äúthis is embarrassing.‚Äù But what are you going to do, it‚Äôs already happened and you obviously need it, so I just rang it through. We‚Äôve never spoken of it. "
3,"Why not call it what it is? Harassment and abuse. Should have thrown that ""customer"" out immediately."
4,"You want the one about the guy who got dumped while he was buying the ring and then awkwardly sat in the middle of the floor and cried, or the guy who bought a ring for the girl he was stalking?

Or the one where I put my foot so far in my mouth I could kick my own ass? 

"
5,"Most lower end jewellers have more restrictions on it, but this luxury chain would allow 30 days on all items and 90 days on engagement rings. (Oh the stories I can tell about those returns!)

There is actually a tester you can use that will identify a diamond from a cubic zirconia, if you had doubts about the item. "
6,BILLY MAYS HERE! THESE JEANS ARE *LITERALLY* ONLY $9.95!
7,"Have had similar experiences, I think it can be a cultural difference perhaps?  Lots of paid programming on TV - all with buy this, get this free!  And I think sometimes those not so familiar with our systems then think they buy something in a store, there should be a ""free"" with it / or if they don't ask, they'll get ripped off, because they only get the ""free"" if they ask. "
8,"Her friends sound mean. It's hard enough learning a new language and then to be told by trusted individuals threat something is said a certain way, when it's not can lead to so much more confusion. "
9,Isn't that theft? Like just straight up theft.
10,You actually believe that customers are smart enough to read signs or get clues??? You could have a sign with 10 ft high neon words saying you are closed and they would still come up and ask if you are open and demand you serve them. 
11,You can return jewellery?  How is the merchant supposed to know that the diamonds/pearls weren‚Äôt switched out?  It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a t-shirt that didn‚Äôt fit...
12,"God I had a similar experience. I work at a restaurant and we had a line of people waiting to be seated. The fair is in town so were packed! We have an obvious LINE and a clipboard set out so people can write their name and party number on the board. 

These jackasses decide to walk past EVERYONE in line and sit themselves at a table that had just been cleaned off for another family (family of like 3 or 4 for a booth.) We were just trying to get the table some cutlery and we turn around and see them. 

We decided ""fuck them"" my manager went over and told them to go to the back of the line. They got mad and informed her that there ""are many opened tables!"" And ""they've been driving for hours!"" Like that's somehow anyone's fault? And none of the tables they pointed at were clean. 

They then had the balls to tell my manager their order. She told them to leave. They refused. So we ignored them for a half hour till they decided to leave. Left us a ""nice"" review in yelp. "
13,"Yep. One of the many things I learned in retail is that customers *always* lie.

Even if it was true. That was a different day. Do people just don't understand that price *can*  change over night?"
14,"That‚Äôs just funny somehow :)

I got that once at a store for tools. People there have orange staff clothing. 
Colleague and I wore blue from where we worked because we were picking something up we needed. 

Guy comes along, out of his mind like ‚Äúyou guys are just nowhere to be found! That‚Äôs such bad customer service!‚Äù 

We try to tell him we don‚Äôt work here but he just cuts us off asking where the f... he can find something. 

I gave him a description of a way to get there, he went off. 

It was my first time to that store. I don‚Äôt know where I sent him. My colleague had a hard time not cracking up. "
15,At least you caught it and stopped him. Can you put a note on the account he was trying to access so if he goes elsewhere that they'll know?
16,I so wanted to but then she probably would have written to the owners and gotten an apology and a $50 gift certificate. 
17,"Had that happen to us with laundry soap. Coworker didnt realize until he went to put it on the shelf behind him and it was almost twice the weight it should have been...

Fun fact: soap weighs less than water"
18,"You should‚Äôve shouted back at her, ‚ÄúSee you at home, grandma!‚Äù"
19,Wow what a grade A bitch. I hope your coworker's dad is ok.
20,"The way you handled the ""free oil"" has earned you my respect. Well done!"
21,"What a psycho!

I have people that get on my case about things being 1/8"" off sometimes. Ugh."
22,"Social Security checks are received on Wednesdays, so discount day being Wednesday or Thursday make the most sense. 

We had a Wednesday senior discount when I was a cashier, and nearly every senior would miss the 'Wednesday' when reading the sign. And many seniors in high school thought it applied to them! lol"
23,"""Hello, is that the manager? I'd like to lodge a complaint about one of your employees who made me pay $33 for a $33 cup! And I have the price tag to prove it!"""
24,"Laws don‚Äôt apply to the wealthy, apparently. "
25,"I really hope he gets the help he needs, willing to ruin his finances over somebody he barely knows, yikes. And yes, I hope she changed her number and never heard from him again. "
26,THE QUALITY IS SO GOOD YOU CAN EVEN USE THEM TO EFFICIENTLY STRANGLE ANNOYING CUSTOMERS!
27,"So now they both have equal luck, and both will have to rely on skill, the same as it was before you wished either of them well. If AC was fine with her chances when she walked in, she should be fine with them now that the playing field is just as even."
28,this is the kinds stuff that i buy from Amazon so i dont have to see anyone
29,"""Are you closed?""

""No ma'am, just a big cone and police tape enthusiast. The pumps however are also just a part of my gas station museum collection, they don't pump any gas."""
30,"""One box of mighty minis coming up!"""
31,Yeah do it all the time and hope other reps will see the note. Not everyone is as diligent as our store...
32,"It's possible. And honestly, he was persistent enough that I bet salespeople just give in sometimes, so he knows it can work."
33,"Ooh, I found this price tag for a pack of gum sitting on the floor of this Ferrari, obviously you must sell it to me for that amount. "
34,"""Well, ma'am, this model of headphones is literally flying off the shelves..."""
35,"LOL! How can you apply for a job and then act like a complete fool over something?  

Sadly at my store we have people who will put in an application before shopping and then at check out they will freak out over the littlest thing &amp; tell cashiers how wrong they are. It‚Äôs enjoyable to watch the manager throw their app in the trash once they leave the store üòÇ"
36,"We seriously need a new subreddit called ""High End Drama"" for us lowly plebians to enjoy."
37,"Please, more engagement ring stories!"
38,"At 94 and 94, my Mom and Dad just went into an assisted living facility. My son asked my Mom if she had made any friends yet.
My mom said ""no"". My son asked why, and my Mom said "" They're 
all old""! Haha. Age is a state of mind. 

They have subsequently made friends with several other couples,
so it's all good. "
39,Yes.
40,"In my store we're not allowed to turn anyone away from the quick checkouts, even if they have over 100 items. 

In fact, some lady called and complained that someone turned her away so management's response was to take the signs that said ""20 items or less"" down and make them all regular checkouts, even though the ""former"" quick checkouts aren't built for that many items."
41,Yeah he's okay. Nothing major. 
42,"""My hovercraft is full of eels."""
43,Sounds like you're just blowing hot air 
44,"The shaking was what got me.  She told me, after the other meat cutter went back to cut the steaks, that she has been so upset over this that 'she hasn't stopped shaking since last night.'  Wut?

Literally all she had to do was say to seafood guy ""can you have someone cut me (6) 1 1/2"" steaks?  These just look a bit small to me"", and the whole problem would have been solved thursday night."
