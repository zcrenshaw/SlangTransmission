0,"Reminds me of one I read years ago, Cashier ringing up a woman and her young daughter when her engagement ring slipped and fell on the floor on the customers side.  She said the little girl darted down to pick it up and she was all set to give her a big thank you except instead of giving it back she puts it on.  After giving the mom a few seconds to correct her daughters inappropriate behavior she asks the girl to please give he back her ring.

&amp;#x200B;

The mother actually argued that the cashier should let her daughter keep the ring since ""she clearly likes it and it looks good on her"".  She got her ring back.  I can't recall if she ordered the girl to give it back and the girl obeyed or if a manager had to threaten the woman with the police...maybe both."

2,I remember reading a similar story on another site where someone took off their ring to wash their hands and a girl standing next to her mother took it and both tried to leave. Storyteller got her ring back but only after the mother and daughter did the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs not hers it‚Äôs mine‚Äù dance. They did the Cinderella test and gave it back to the correct person
3,"My state, Washington, is raising the age for cigs to 21 next year. I work in a grocery store, it's gonna be interesting. All these just turned 18 year olds who smoke are going to be grumpy."
4,"Here's the thing, if you have a refund coming then there is simply [no penalty](https://money.cnn.com/2014/04/13/pf/taxes/filing-late-penalty/) for missing the deadline. I guess your forms would technically be filed late, but [IRS penalties](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/important-facts-about-filing-late-and-paying-penalties) are calculated as a percentage of tax owed. Essentially, they make you pay your tax owed and add a penalty of a percentage of that number. $0 taxes owed, no pentalty.

Since you overpaid (i.e., deserve a refund), you don't owes any taxes, so no penalty.

If you don't file, you just don't get your refund. Also, after 3 years (I think) they won't let you file late for your refund. So the government will just keep you money. Either way, the IRS doesn't lose."
5,"After ‚ÄúThe customer is always right.‚Äù you should reply, ‚ÄúYes. And in this case, I‚Äôm the customer since **I bought this.**‚Äù"
6,the Cinderella test is when you change someone into a pumpkin and asses if they appear surprised by this action
7,"THREE other stores?

The fuck is that guy on?"
8,I need to befriend this man haha
9,"I love it when the customers say ""You've just lost a customer!"" They think it's a way to make me feel bad, but I really feel relieved because I won't have to deal with them again (sometimes)"
10,"""There's always the wind. That's (currently) free."""
11,+1 for pressing charges!  What a nutball she was...
12,"I'm from the Midwest, currently living in Wisconsin. I'm not sure I understand your question."
13,"It's the back, not Warehouse 13. üòÇ"
14,"My husband bought me a black diamond ring for this last Christmas. I've been wanting it for awhile and it's gorgeous, I must say. Since then, I've had TWO women just grab my hand to ""look"" at the ring and try to get it off my finger in the process! The last one acted offended when I jerked my hand away while she was trying to get it off my finger and said, ""well, can you take it off so I can actually see it?"" No. The answer was no. She was pissed, but somehow she never complained or anything"
15,"Im surprised she said sorry, thats a polite karen."
16,"That could have been called in as vandalism, she could have been forced to pay reparations"
17,Hes a pretty chill guy. Asked me to join him one day. But I dont smoke weed (even if I wanted to my lungs are fucked up as it is)
18,"The bright side is that the break room is usually also ""in the back"".  When I worked retail, I did overstock and stocked the shelves, so I knew exactly what was ""in the back"".  Any time someone asked me to check ""in the back"", I would just treat myself to an unscheduled 10 minute break before returning to the floor."
19,"The second scenario is fun as a manager, because they'll demand to call me, and I get to show up and be all, 'Yeah, they were the nice ones in this scenario, we won't be doing anything for you now.' God but people are dumb."
20,"It's not like your store policy is any different from any other store.  Pretty much everywhere refunds the money in the same way it was paid for, or gives store credit. I got some pants for Christmas that didn't fit. They came with a gift receipt. The person who gave them to me paid with a card, so I had to find something else in the store to buy since I didn't have the card to refund the money to. I didn't complain, I just found some clothes that fit."
21,Where I work we have this old man that comes in every Monday and Thursday. He is awful to have to deal with. He will yell at people run over other customers and throw things in the floor for no reason. He will also go around the store and write every associates name down that don't speak to him even if the associate is busy helping someone else.
22,Throwing things on the floor like that should be grounds to get him banned from the store.
23,"They aren't going to be grandfathered in?  When they raised the drinking age from 19 to 21 in the state I grew up in anyone who turned 19 before the law went into effect was still legally allowed to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

Come to think of it that must have been pretty confusing for the cashiers but it was also before states started cracking down on underage drinking and started making laws and or policies like a cashier being fined for selling to a minor or carding everyone in a group so the consequences of fucking up were essentially non-existent."
24,"""Adam Ruins Everything"" did an episode on outlet stores.  They are practically different companies."
25,It's kind of odd that a business would stop taking on all tax return work the instant after the filing deadline. Taxes that are overdue still need to be paid. There are just extra fines and penalties involved depending on how overdue and whether an extension was obtained.
26,What the hell is someone doing with 32oz of melted nacho cheese?!
27,"Riddle me this, where do you think we keep Warehouse 13?"
28,"I had someone complain to management about me because I wouldn't sell them my watch.

I work in a goddamn grocery store.  Never mind the fact that's just flat out *my* watch; it's the first **nice** watch I've ever had.  I'm a woman cursed with man hands, so it's been hard for me to find a woman's watch that I don't just totally dwarf.  My uncle happened upon one and gave it to me for Christmas, and I fuckin' love it.  Ain't no way in hell I'm selling it."
29,"Someone told me ""the customer is always right"".

I work in a hospital."
30,Any bets on who scratched off the number? ü§î
31,"I would have showed him the original one and say something like ""yeah 30$ is a good deal and material also feels different""."
32,"I wonder what on earth he was trying to accomplish. Like... mom died? And checks? To the bank? But...?
I feel like a real dummy because I have NO IDEA what he wanted from you other than what you gave him. *pat pat* You did a good job. :)"
33,"Yep. I did this for a few years during residency. I knew I was owed a refund and I was too damn busy to be bothered with it even though at that point there were pretty easy as taxes go. Eventually just went to an accountant, handed her a stack of stuff and said fix it, then got a big fat check.  

Penalties in this case? My mental health, paying an accountant, and giving the federal govt an interest free loan for a few years."
