0,"*But no, she wasn't here for ham. She was here for beef.*  

This in itself makes you my hero."
1,I had someone like this before. It was really sad because their Mom died like 4-5 different times.
2,"Do people just not.... read things, anymore? 

"
3,"Haha, thank you! Not going to lie, I'm pretty proud of that one!"
4,"Reading that title, I did not expect something wholesome af. That was nice!"
5,"That whole family sounds like a real piece of work. I can clearly see where that girl learned her harassing behavior, and good for you boss for standing up to their BS."
6,"Wow, scanner lasers give people cancer! No wonder everyone who's ever come into contact with them end up dead!

Seriously."
7,"Maybe it's an age thing.

When I was a kid, they were called 1/8"" jacks (or 1/4"" for the large ones)."
8,"I know at stores, people will pick up receipts and use it to try to return shoplifted products, but you can't do that with gas. Not to mention I highly doubt there are people out there picking up random scraps of paper at a gas station in hopes of getting a credit card number. 

I find a receipt, I just assume the person didn't want it and pop it into the paper trash bin. "
9,"I was thinking he would be dead, and you would hear something crack as you loaded him up. Damn it, OP, don't scare me."
10,"I let mine have a ‚Äòdo over‚Äô. A few deep breaths.  Use your words to tell me what‚Äôs wrong. How can we fix it?  If they are still upset through this it‚Äôs fine...they have pretty big feelings at this age...as long as it isn‚Äôt a full blown melt down....if you pitch a fit you definitely aren‚Äôt gonna get what you want!!! 

So maybe she was in the let‚Äôs fix it stage?  "
11,"I was almost this kid once. My grandmother is disabled, and so when I'm there to visit she sends me shopping with her card. Last time I was there I forgot her PIN, thank goodness she had tap."
12,"I live for the day I hear ""does anyone work here?"" while I'm out and about. Fucking hell I hate that baby boomers seem to think passive aggressive questions are the proper way to communicate with people. "
13,"I work in a courthouse and have to deal with restraining orders on a regular basis. It's pretty commonplace to have someone come in for a restraining order against someone who got one against them, because they're being harassed by the protected party. Some people certainly don't mind violating their own restraining orders. 

I haven't had to deal with restraining orders between little kids, though. That's a new one. "
14,"Sadly, yes. I worked in a coffee shop, which was located in a book store. I would walk around the store with drink and food samples that were clearly labeled with what each item was. People would look right at the label and ask what the item was. I‚Äôm like... you‚Äôre in a book store! Read the label! "
15,Guess she didnt need her ponchos badly enough to make you drop your task to get them for her earlier. What a RL üôÑ
16,Maybe he was adopted by a polyamorous group of lesbians and had 4-5 moms?
17,"This really needs to be higher up.  If you have any audio equipment experience, 1/8"" and 1/4"" are standard terms used everyday.

OP, I'm sorry, but I think you're in the wrong for making fun of this guy. "
18,"This is so wholesome and adorable. They thought you were so old that you must be 9. 

How old is your manager? Does he look old enough to be your dad or were they completely off about that too?"
19,"Yep, my parents were seeing red that the courts even allowed it. She was supposed to attend regular mediation and counselling, but the other girl and her mother rarely showed up to the meetings, which I think helped her case in getting it dropped."
20,"Wait, she asked for a bag knowing she was gonna use it for her son to piss in but asked where the bathrooms were anyway? "
21,"&gt;Pictured is a 2 meter tall tree that is very clearly supposed to be planted outdoors. It‚Äôs planted in a tiny pot in her bedroom and she is right, it does look like it‚Äôs dying.

How are people who don't know how to follow instructions also intelligent enough to know to come back to ask for a refund? I mean, you'd expect something from a *garden* department to be planted *outdoors*‚Ä¶"
22,Can't decide.  Did the father reinforce throwing a fit gets you what you want?
23,$2 says the Bluetooth Speaker was broken and something he found in the dumpster.
24,"Kids having no concept of age is endlessly hilarious to me. When I was 16 my two 8 year old cousins couldn't believe I was born in the 1990s, I was sooooo old. 

And yeah they were completely off, he's only 24"
25,"I mean, the facts are clear. 100% of people who come into contact with lasers will die.

... Typically after having lived about 70-80 years, just like the ones that didn't come in to contact with any lasers."
26,Just tell her everything in store was scanned into stock ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
27,"Thank goodness for the guy behind him in the line. Nice feel good story. 

This is the nightmare scenario I always envisioned as a kid whenever we'd get to the checkout and my mom went back into an aisle for something; being left on the hook with a growing line of angry people behind me and no way to pay. Never happened but *it could have*, maybe. "
28,"‚ÄúActually, sir, this is not the only store that sells them...because *we don‚Äôt sell them.*‚Äù
"
29,"Sorry sir, the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, signed by President Ford, says otherwise."
30,Because putting it into the oven is the hard part of making an apple pie
31,"Yes, someone probably does have it worse than you but that doesn‚Äôt discount your feelings. You have just as much right to a bad week as he does. "
32,I'm so sorry. This post made me nauseated I can't imagine what you went through. 
33,Your response is honestly goals. 
34,"LOL.  ""Well Maam, we do scan everything into inventory with a laser when we stock our shelves.  What is one more scan going to do?""

I'm actually surprised you caved to this.  I would have told her some BS policy about tracking inventory and that we HAD to.scan them just in the hope she would leave.  There is only so much stupidity I can handle."
35,"Dented cans do have the possibility of contaminating the contents of said can, but the stores can't say for sure if the dented cans they DO have are punctured in any way. Most of them seem fine, but there's always that gamble. Most stores just damage out the goods, while others take the risk, depending on the size of the dent, and put them on the shelves."
36,"(Mock her back): ""Onn threeee??"""
37,"**No! No one works here! You baby boomers outsourced all the jobs to China, and now there‚Äôs no one!**"
38,"I don't blame your parents for being angry. I'd like to know the thought process behind a judge/any court official signing off on a restraining order for a nine year old, as if that's totally fine. That's excessive (to put it mildly). "
