0,"I used to work at a high end clothing store and we had shoplifters all day every day.  Normally I wouldn't care very much, but the company policy stated that if you caught someone shoplifting you would get 25% of what the stolen items rang up to.  I spent most of my days just looking for shoplifters and I got really good at it.  That reward for catching somebody shoplifting made the job so much more enjoyable."
1,That girl has no chance in life with a mother like that. They both need to grow up.
2,"I had one guy, a regular, who usually smelt pretty rank but one week it was particularly foul. We're talking fighting back your gag reflex levels of bad it wasn't just the usual BO but now a foul stench like rotting meat and ammonia. He disappears for a couple weeks and next time I see him he's in a wheel chair and missing a leg and it clicks...what I had smelled was his necrotic foot/leg."
3,"The sad part is if she called customer service about her issue they probably would give her a gift card.   Had a lady scream at me for not price matching.  She said it was  ""the law"".   Only in your head lady."
4,"He left them in a different store. So he shows up at the store he left them in, says, ""I called about my keys that I left here!"" Gets told, ""nobody called about any keys"" says, ""don't give me that!"""
5,"Lol, well at least he called down after realizing his mistake!"
6,"I had a lady threaten to call the police and have me and my manager arrested for refusing to do a refund outside of the return window. She was clearly not quite all there though. I always find it amusing that some people think the police are the appropriate people to call in these sorts of situations, take it to court if you want but if you think the cops are going to come by and force the till open you're in for some disappointment."
7,"I find it amusing that she would call you for something like that, as if you could do anything about it. Your response was genuine and a lot nicer then I would have put it. She had four years to pay for the plots and did nothing with them. I don't feel one ounce of pity for her at all!"
8,"I love root beer. Few people do, so most restaurants/fast food places do not carry it. I should go into those places and scream that I am being discriminated against because they don't have what I like."
9,"Ugh, I shudder that this is one of those horror stories where the strange dad is trying abduct a girl to be his strange son‚Äôs wife."
10,"I think this was the right move lol, what are the cops going to do over some candy? Ya scared some sense into them"
11,"Fun story- I worked at a party rental company and moved up to office manager. Weekends were (obviously) the busiest days but we usually delivered Thurs, Fri or Sat with pickup on Mon. One Sunday late afternoon I ended up being the only one in the office. A lady called to complain about tables&amp; chairs being dirty, her waterslide not working and being shorted on cotton candy colors. I asked for her reservation number- she didn't have it and started getting upset. At this point I was on her side and just trying to get enough info to figure out my next step. Last name, phone number, address- nothing shows up in our system. I asked if she was certain she had the right rental place. She calls me all types of names and says she's calling the police. Police actually do show up maybe 15mins later... because she made threats. Later I found out she was just giving me her personal info- not the info for the party, account or payment. She didn't realize a waterslide needed WATER to work even though the guys who delivered everything explained it all. She was upset we didn't come out to clean up after her ""pre-party"". And she didn't realize that ""pink, blue or both"" meant only two colors of sugar."
12,"My dad lost his leg below the knee to diabetes 3 years ago and I just had the good sense in the ER with him (he refused to let me see him for the two weeks prior to that while sepsis was taking hold) to not breathe through my nose and keep my distance.  His ankle looked like a rotten potato, I've seen less horrors on literal horror movies.  His leg had split open and it was oozing all sorts of colors.  He thought he would get out the next day.  3 months later, after a remodel of his house, a two step amputation, and 6 weeks in inpatient rehab, he came home."
13,That is one of my theories!  Easily could have got our branch mixed up with another - there's one not that far down the road.
14,You went above and beyond what was necessary. It was his job to ensure they were adequately protected. Some people just assume they‚Äôre victims.
15,"Huh. I had no idea how trying on underwear worked. It seemed pretty gross to me.

Also, unscented detergent could avoid the sniff test."
16,"This is one of the reasons I loathe cash back. Something like this happened to me when I'd only been at my present job for a couple of weeks. A woman phoned claiming I hadn't given her the cash back (even though she'd signed for it). When checked they could clearly see I'd handed it to her. But I felt falsely accused and really worried about it. That wouldn't bother me now, I'm more seasoned/jaded.
Now I try to skip asking if they want it, even though I'm supposed to ask whenever prompted. Well, if everybody wanted it, I'd never have any money in the till. Plus we have a free cash machine right by the entrance/exit.
I've asked ""Cash back?"" only to have the customers stand there deciding for bloody ages. Its not a fricking philosophical question for heaven's sake!  Aaargh! I hate cash back!!"
17,She definitely has mental issues. Poor lady and poor kids.
18,She‚Äôs actually the second person that found out I didn‚Äôt work there any more but still called to ask me for help üòÖ
19,Where do I sign up??
20,But she said she taking her business elsewhere! How would she use the gift card?! /s
21,"We have a regular who ‚Äúruns a cat rescue‚Äù this woman I guarantee is not licensed and just keeps fifty cats in her basement (she freely admits this number btw) and istg y‚Äôall I grew up with cats, changed litter boxes, hell my childhood cat died of bladder cancer so I have smelled my fair share of cat pee but this lady, oooofff. You smell her as soon as she walks in, you can literally follow a scent trail to her, and it‚Äôs so PUNGENT it‚Äôs like someone distilled essence of cat piss and the worst part? Her son always pays cash, do you know what cat piss money smells like? Do you know what it‚Äôs like for money to leave a residue on your hands that rubbing alcohol can‚Äôt remove the smell of? I literally have to quarantine the money after he leaves because it permeates from the till and I cannot bring myself to give those bills to another human being. After they leave I literally have to lysol the entire checkout area and febreeze in order to stop gagging THATS how long the smell lingers."
22,"After my husband died I would grocery shop in the wee hours at the 24 hour food store. My eyes were always red and watery and I had dropped weight. I knew what I looked like but I didn't care. The harassment from store security and the hostility from the cashiers was constant. If I'd known about the ""rules"" of no physical involvement I probably would have eventually just started walking out with carts of food, as I lived two blocks away. I get the impression that these shoplifters run on a drug mule-style ratio numbers game based off a ""go-big because why not"" attitude. But it was really funny to see the same two people in different styles of dress always be six feet behind me in the frozen pizza poof aisle at 3 am twice a week shooting side glances betwixt ""witty normal couple banter"" quips while actual crackheads were lugging out cantaloupes by the double handful."
23,"&gt; a mom and adult daughter who had come in for maternity style pictures but then became pissed when I asked when the baby was due because no one was actually pregnant

So they just ended up with a series of photos that inexplicably centered around one/both of their bellies? I don't know why but I find the mental image of two grown-ass women sat glowing with pride at each other whilst cradling their stomachs for photo after photo hilarious."
24,"Geez, did he wear them every single day for 5 months?"
25,Pull the sweater out of your ass??
26,"Starting when I was 15 I worked in my local grocery store. There was this one old man who used to come in all the time, touch my hair and tell me he thought I was pretty. If ever I had my hair in braids, he'd grab them and use them to pull me forward across the till towards him while he told me how pretty I was and asked me to come to his house and make him dinner.

Management never did anything, they said he was ""harmless,"" and we were a small enough store that 9/10 of my shifts I was the only cashier, so I couldn't avoid him. After about a year he started waiting until close and hanging out in the parking lot for us to finish. 

Luckily for me, my parents always picked me up and I used to walk out with my manager, but I still remember how terrifying it was. 

I'm sorry this happened to you, I know how terrifying it can be."
27,"That‚Äôs pretty much what happened. I think they were just goofing around and it was all a joke to them but didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd actually think they were pregnant. So yeah... tell me you want pregnancy photos, I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre pregnant."
28,I bet she has stolen for a long time to get to that level. It's cool you got to interact with her. It probably helps you develop an eye for deception a lot of us lack.
29,"Yeah, with the stories I‚Äôve read here, I‚Äôd expect him to demand a refund to compensate him for his confusion!"
30,"Oh geez. Idk how many times in my retail career I‚Äôve had to ask if it could possibly be under another name, the customer swears up and down that it‚Äôs not, and then find out it‚Äôs under another name."
