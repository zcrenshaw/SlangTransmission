My girlfriend told me she had a dream about dating a a backstreet boy. I told her go back to sleep and break it off 
I usually look at my feet to do my best not to trip on the stairs 
Foreplay. Lots of it. Get her to where she HAS TO have you. 
It's supposed to be fun. Find someone who agrees. So many people take sex way too seriously and put so much pressure on themselves that I have to wonder if they even enjoy it at all. 
Always finish in missionary so you can roll off and get the dry spot in bed.  
"Women with full body pictures on their profile in addition to the headshot.

Guys very much want to know how slim a woman is, while fatter women generally object to guys judging them on that. Weight is more changeable than height but otherwise it's very comparable."
Get insulted that she would even dream about you cheating. 
"We have an unspoken policy of not rejecting each other, but also of not initiating when one of us is noticeably exhausted/under the weather /...

Therefore, rejection doesn't happen between us.
"
"There is a syaing that goes ""Men are afraid women will laugh at them, women are afraid men will beat them to death"". 

Men ore most often not afraid for their physical safety in everyday life as women are. So when you talk about feeling safe, it might be a different thing for men and women. 

I think many men in relationships feel emotionally insecure. Men are often not as in touch with their emotions and as good at talking about them as women. 

My wife made med feel emotionally safe in a wonderful way just a few months after we had started dating. Where we live, the norm is for each person to pay for their own meal/tickets/whatever on a date (because gender equality is a thing). So, after a few months of dating my wife (then girlfriend) and I went to the movies, and she paid the tickets. I reached for my wallet to pay her back for my ticket, and she said, ""don't worry, it will even out over a ten year period"". I felt wonderful. She was thinking about our relationship as something that would last for ten years!

That was 12 years ago. I paid for the movie tickets last week, so I guess we're even now. "
"We fucked like bunnies for the first 10 years together.    Kinda slowed down a bit, then went dead bedroom for a while.    I can't help but feel like a lot of the posters here haven't been in a relationship very long.    Libidos change, and it's a difficult thing to reconcile.    Most don't."
Lock the door.
Look at that ass.
"Came from a broken family. Never really had much affection growing up. What made me feel safe with my ex back then was that she would always be excited to see and talk to me. Made me feel special. She always asked me how my day was even if my day was bland and she wouldn‚Äôt even care. She was someone i could be with and feel like i was at home. I messed up and I have a lot of growing up to do. I hope she‚Äôs doing well for herself, wherever she is."
"Everytime I try to initiate sex.  We only have sex if she's in the mood, or if she changes her mind later in the evening.  We end up about once per week.  Even my flirting gets shot down.  I swear my wife is a cat.  The less attention I give her, the more she wants my company."
"I always watch the steps I'm about to step onto. Most view I'm getting of anyone ahead of me is their ankles, the most sexual part of a woman anyway."
"My wife offered me many things when we first dated, but safety was not one of them, until...

I made a fool of myself in front of important people and she smoothly covered for me.  I felt safe from myself for the first time in my life.  It was a very weird feeling."
That my friend is a socially acceptable ass stare.  Enjoy responsibly.

"Marginal tax isn't that complex to grasp. It doesn't mean that at $8,925 you pay 10% but once you make $8,926 you pay 15% overall. It just means the first $8,925 is taxed at 10% and then at $8,926, $1 is taxed 15% while the rest is taxed at 10%."
"I fell asleep at a post-funeral get together when we were a very new couple.  Snored loud as hell right in the main atrium with the judging looks of a very upper-middle extended family questioning my naive girlfriends' choice in boys.

She told them I had been working 60+ hour weeks between my degree and internship, and she insisted I didn't have to come, but I wanted to support her.  They were very eager then to usher me to a bedroom where I could nap for a bit, totally understanding the difficulty with work ethic and loyalty to a new love.  They respected my effort even if I struggled.

The truth was, the night before I got drunk and stayed up too late playing online poker because I was nervous about the meetup.  She covered for me like a down comforter.  My forever love, together 15 years this month.

edit: for every man out there looking for their own, keep in mind this - 

*that woman is out there, and she wants you*

Every man fucks up.  And fucks up hard.  A woman is there who wants you despite you being a dumbass one time.  If you give up, you won't find yours.  She is waiting for you, brother."
Reverse image search that shit and make sure it's legit before reciprocating.
"Never anymore, because I don't bother asking"
"She makes me feel safe to be me.

Most of my exes put some effort into trying to change me. My current SO accepts me as I am."
By worrying too much over menial things and remembering to breathe.
"If you move something out of place. Put it back. If you drop something, pick it up.

I‚Äôve never been the cleanest person but nowadays i just appreciate order and organization"
STRIKE HARD! STRIKE FIRST! NO MERCY!
"""Porn is not indicative of good sex. Usually."""
"I have met with 4 different women who easily weighed 100+ lbs more than their picture indicated. Stayed for the date all 4 times but don‚Äôt pull that shit. It‚Äôs dishonest and shortsighted.

"The most likely thing to kill me as a man between the ages of 18 to 45, is myself. A woman who can protect me from myself is the safest thing to have.

Edit: seeing as this comment has gotten a lot of attention (thanks for the gold BTW), it seems a good opportunity to let other struggling men who live without the fairer sex to help them through know about [CALM](https://www.thecalmzone.net), get some help lads. "
"Probably 25% of the time.

I've found it's better not to ask and just to initiate, she's far less likely to turn me down.

It's like if my brother said ""hey you wanna come help me shingle my roof?"" I'd say ""fuck no man.""

But if he invited me over and he was just shingling his goddamn roof I'd go ahead and climb up the ladder and give him a hand.

Walk &gt; talk.

EDIT: 69 points.  awright awright awright.

EDIT: Had to point out this crazy coincidence.  Last night my fucking roof started leaking, and I'm shopping for shingles and ladders today.  Fuck my life."

How have you survived this long?
I'll have some really rough and negative days where I'm hard on myself. I don't like the person I am doing that time and in the past I often would avoid others. My girlfriend lets me know that she loves me and even loves me when I'm in that negative place. It makes me feel safe emotionally and in the relationship.
"I obviously get more random smiles from other people and there are no funny looks anymore.

I now also treated differently by doctors: I have a ganglion in my right foot (it's not an issue at the moment, but get inflamed sometimes). When I was overweight/obese it was always mentioned, that it could be gout (even tho my uric acid levels are normal) or related to my weight. Now it's just a ganglion and will be removed when it shows up the next time."
The clitoris is a thing that exists.
"I go to yoga classes where I'm one of like three guys in the entire class, and I have the same exact issue. I try to look up at the instructor to make sure I'm doing everything right, but I don't want all the girls surrounding me to think that I'm staring at every pair of cheeks sitting there in front of me. Especially while they're all bent over in all these exotic ass positions. It's tough man

Okay I'll sit in the front row next class damn leave me alone"

"My wife and I are expecting our first child. I‚Äôm the youngest sibling/cousin, I‚Äôve never really dealt with kids, so I‚Äôve been pawing my way through some baby books here and there, just general tips I guess, things to look out for. I get anxious on occasion when I start thinking about taking care of a newborn, which seems to be a pretty normal reaction.

My wife has been doing loads of research on caring for newborns, parenting advice, the same kind of info I‚Äôve been reading, times ten. I asked her the other day, when can babies start eating food other than breastmilk or formula, and what would we feed him. She looked me dead in the eyes and replied ‚ÄúI have no fucking clue. But between that stack of books, our parents, and you and I, that baby is going to be very well cared for.‚Äù

It was like this pressure my body has become accustomed too, something I didn‚Äôt even know was there, had been lifted off of me, when she said that, and made me feel very safe in our parenting abilities. I don‚Äôt need to keep my fingers crossed, anymore.

Edit: Thanks for all the comments and pm‚Äôs, my wife and I are as nervous as expected, but it appears support pours out of nearly everywhere I look, and I know our little dude is going to be well taken care of! Thank you!"

woah, this thing exploded! I understand many people meet their partners while working. I mean, do not fuck around just for fucking a hot pal or guy, love is a different story, and in love there are no rules, anything and everything is allowed!!

And when I say ""I mean"", is as I understood the advice. Also, do not fuck with your coworkers, -not in a sexual way, same same but different.

Thanks for the votes you fuckers!  :P"
"Used to live with a buddy and his girlfriend, she ran his life.  My favorite story to tell is when she had a dream that she had to go to the hospital and he wouldn‚Äôt take her because he was with another girl.  She woke up and immediately woke him up and yelled at him for a solid half hour.  HE HAD TO EXPLAIN HIS ACTIONS IN HER DREAM.

They‚Äôve been married for 13 years now.

P.S.  She also sent him to out once to get her a muffin when he was barely functioning from the flu.

P.P.S.  She would yell at him for farting in the bathroom.

P.P.P.S.  She had a medical procedure done that kept her up all night in pain and was absolutely livid at him that he was able to sleep.

P.P.P.P.S.  She would text him from the bedroom to bring her a Hot Pocket.  About 20 feet away."
"Simple. Step 1: ‚Äúit wasnt real‚Äù. Now for a normal functioning human being thats that so maybe you wont need step 2. But if not, step 2: ‚Äúoh? Well i saw you FUCK a guy in my dream so you are fucked right now‚Äù"
"Think, *then* speak."
"I was lucky in the sense that when I was fat nobody really gave me shit for it so the changes are not huge.

But since I am not fat anymore, I feel sometimes people are nicer to me (like bartenders or cashiers for example). To be fair it might be that I am a bit more confident and smile a bit more so it helps.

If I dress nicely-ish and try to look happy when I walk around, sometimes I have girls smilling at me, definitly doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes which is better than before when it was never."

"I'm an EOD tech and I had a pretty rough deployment back in 2012. Nothing too crazy at all, just some unpleasant, grisly memories that I'd rather forget. I'm mostly over it at this point but sometimes if I'm falling asleep or drunk I'll get flashbacks and she'll let me be little spoon or hold my head in her lap until I calm down. She's the only woman to ever touch me in a comforting manner and it's helped immensely with my nerves. I'm less irritable and anxious nowadays and it's definitely thanks to her non-judgmental support. "
"Have you ever had a dream that felt real? Once I had a dream that I entered a dance competition with Luke Wilson (we won) and when I woke up I felt like a weird pang.

Dreams can be forgotten as soon as you wake up or they can linger. The dreamer doesn‚Äôt really get to decide. If she‚Äôs shouting at you then yeah she‚Äôs a nutter but if she‚Äôs just a little off, I get it. As I said _the human brain is fucking weird_.

"Lost 130lbs in 6 months.  The world treated me the same until I learned how to dress and fix my posture, then it became much more welcoming. "
"A few years back, my roommate, who was a big match.com user pulled me into his room to look at a picture of one of his potential dates. He asked me what I thought about her looks, and I said she was very cute. Then he said ‚Äúyeah, but look closer. Do you notice anything?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt notice anything. Then he pointed to the background of her main photo. She was standing near a gas station. He pointed to the station‚Äôs sign. 

‚ÄúYou see, PhartParty, gas hasn‚Äôt been that low in a few years. I‚Äôm thinking she kept this older picture around because she‚Äôs gained weight since then.‚Äù

I laughed and laughed, partially because this dude has always been exceptionally analytical, but mostly because it seemed like such a ridiculous thing to think about. I said ‚Äúmaybe, but do you really want to think about it that much? Just meet her! If you like each other, great. If not, it‚Äôs whatever.‚Äù

So they ended up going on a date, and as it turns out, he was right. She had gained a considerable amount of weight. He showed me a selfie they took while out on the town and no lie, she looked like a completely different person. Still cute, and they seemed to have a good time, but goddamn if my old roomie didn‚Äôt blow my mind with his oddball online dating intuition. "
"I'm able to be sensitive and emotional at times without being subtly judged or punished for it. My last girlfriend would claim that everything was okay after I would cry or get emotional about something but then we wouldn't have sex for weeks. It was clear that she did not find those kind of displays attractive. She was all about traditional masculinity all the time.

I am traditionally masculine in many ways but keeping that up 24/7 is exhausting. It's nice to be able to be myself with my current girlfriend."
Sigh. This thread just made me kinda lonely. My dog makes me feel safe though.
Guys are far less subtle when making friends than girls are in my experience. If you want to make guys friends invite them to the bar or something. Men generally prefer direct invitations to events and stuff.

Anytime my doorbell rings unexpectedly I get annoyed.
"Pretty much, it‚Äôs not like we never have sex, it‚Äôs just only when she wants it "
"When I was with my SO, almost never. It was only when something was bothering her,  like her grandparents passing away or her mother losing her hearing is when she‚Äôd turn me down.

And you know.... that‚Äôs understandable. "
Quit playing games with her heart man.
"I heard once that people consider the stuff that gets women off to just be foreplay but the stuff that gets men off to be real sex (ie PIV) which is why women don't get off anywhere nearly as often as men so stop treating foreplay like it's just a warm up but rather like it's actually as important as sex 

Edit: I'm a woman yall. Stop telling me how much women like piv I already know...."

Which, is rough because you know, you kind of become this character to the world and it's hard to break. My ex actually, not when we were together but now years later, she still calls me every week. Talks about my mental health, and stuff. Which is good because I can't talk to anyone else and what's in my head scares me. "
"Best advice I ever received: Be with someone who respects you.


__________________
This is the best advice I can give:

* Stop caring about your insecurities, let go, and have fun. Because the other person is just as concerned about their imperfections. 
 
* You are the one who is in charge of what sex is supposed to feel like. If you want every encounter to be awesome, then you have to work to make it that way.

* Find someone who makes you laugh.

* Don't be afraid to share your kinks, or directly point out what they're doing right or wrong. This is important. Your partner can either decide that this is highly unattractive and unromantic; or be grateful that you know what you like, and aren't afraid to ask.

* Always ask for permission, and check in with your partner. like don't immediately start choking someone without first asking if they would be ok with it... (good way to get stabbed). Also stop if someone tells you that they don't want or like it. (eg choking someone after they tell you to stop).

* crate the dog. Seriously.

Wait, now hold on. You may be on to something. What if fixing things around the house makes her horny? You're missing a golden opportunity to wear your toolbelt and nothing else while *pretending* to fix something."
"I went from 440 pounds down to 208 pound and now 240 while bodybuilding. I'm currently writing a book about the psychological changes you see and feel with such drastic weight loss. 

These are some of the things I personally see and feel

1. You still see/feel yourself as overweight at times and other times you feel like you look amazing. You become overly critical of any small insignificant changes. I was (luckily not so much anymore) obsessed with the scale and would freak at any changes. 

I had self deprecating humor and while fat, people had a pity laugh at my expense. If i make fun of myself now, some people make it sound like i'm fishing for compliments even though it was what I used to break the ice in the room.

2. Dating was actually just as hard. I had a full skin reduction surgery on my back, chest, arms, stomach and legs. I definitely raised my attraction factor quite a bit. When going on dates, women would think that I was a player and I ""had to have a ton of girls hitting on me"". Wasn't remotely the case. I'm a closet nerd that likes the gym and bodybuilding. I read on my off time and go hiking.  

3. Going out to bars stink at times. I'm a much more muscular guy than I was. I don't drink and people for some reason always want to fight. They start with the ""You think you're big huh? Think you're tough"". Luckily my profession keeps me calm and I just remove myself from those situations but it isn't fun.

4. I teach some classes at the gym and it is nice having the older women trying to hit on me or pawn their daughters to me. It gives me a decent boost of confidence and helps me keep my positive attitude. I decline everyone but it is nice to feel that ""attraction"" factor for yourself. 

There is more if anyone is interested. There are many good things but also no one really talks about the negatives that happen when you lose weight. It's almost all mental though.

She was shorter than me too lol."
"When my BMI was over 50, I was invisible, people didn't want to look at me at all. They were polite when we talked, but that's it.

Your mind and body is the only thing that‚Äôs truly yours in this world and should be preserved and given opportunities to flourish. 

Our society gives a lot of credit to intelligence but fails to realise that the mind and body shouldn‚Äôt have to be two opposite things. Just because you‚Äôre smart doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be unfit, or just because you‚Äôre fit it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be dumb. "

"For a time my tinder bio was ""your height requirements must match my weight requirements"" and i had so many salty women it was amazing"
"Kind of a complicated topic. I talked to her about it a lot.

We agreed that I can grab her boobs, butt and pussy (because I love it all so much, and she loves that I love it) anytime we're just the two of us (unless when she is cleaning, she doesn't like it then) and that it doesn't have to mean we have to have sex. But she knows whenever it happens, I would basically be up for it and that she can then initiate. The plan is that she should be the one to initiate most of the time.

Basically, I feel her up multiple times a day and a few times a week it results in actual sex. It's all non verbal because we talked about it. I have to add that I love touching her. I don't have to have sex to enjoy her. Squeezing her ass and boobs makes me happy as well. This is us after many years. She laughs at me because I never stop touching her, and at some times is a little annoyed. Like, really, now? But she also says that she'd know immediately that something is wrong when it stops.

I realize it's just psychological play, but for me, I never feel rejected this way. I also have to admit that right now, a little more sex would be nice. But the situation is the unfortunate result of our travel schedules in recent months."
"You don't. This is her problem, not yours."
True equality

"In case you're interested in insight beyond the chorus of bitter men moaning about how all women never want sex, here you go:

Some women (and from what I can tell, *many* women) need to mentally and emotionally prepare for sexy time. It's difficult for us to stop our train of thoughts and stressors at a moment's notice to be receptive to sex, but we need that mental real estate to get in the mood. Meanwhile, for men, getting turned on is more external; you guys tend to be more turned on by visual or tactile stimuli. It's the same difference that makes women more likely to read erotica or watch porn that sets up detailed scenarios, and men more likely to look at pornographic photos or watch porn that focuses on views of the body.

So with that in mind, a lot of ""she always shoots me down"" complaints (not all, of course, but a lot) stem from not engaging in a way that allows your partner to get into the mood with you. Rather than trying to initiate all at once, clue your partner in to where your head is early in the day. ""Hey, I know we have a lot going on, but I really want to spend some time doing the sex later."" [Use better words... But you get the idea.] Don't make it sound like you're scheduling a meeting or something, just let her know that you want her. It usually doesn't hurt to follow up with a couple of mildly seductive comments throughout the day so that the thought of intimacy doesn't get too far buried beneath all of life's other goings on. This way, when it's time to actually do the touchy stuff, she's had a chance to make space for it in her mind, and she's likely to be more receptive.

Also, read The 5 Love Languages. It's not specific to sex, but it will help you understand how to keep emotional intimacy between you and your partner so that physical intimacy comes more naturally.

Good luck! :) "

That I thought about killing myself last week. I daydreamed about it and wasn‚Äôt sure if I was relieved or upset when I came to. 
"That's so fucking sweet, and awesome. I hope to find someone like that one day. Congrats!"
At her ass. 
"Dude like it‚Äôs even taking away my enjoyment of porn. Chocking, slapping, painanal, does anyone remember sex is supposed to be fun?"
What'd she do? 
"Keep talking about it man. My wife has a crazy low libido after kids but mine is really high. We talk about sex a lot because I don‚Äôt feel loved without it but she only needs it like once a month. We have sex 1-3 times a week though.

We talk and I ask what I can do to make her want it more. Cleaner home, me cooking, her getting more rest, time spent on hobbies. Keep talking man and make sure she understands it‚Äôs important. Take the love language quiz so she can see it‚Äôs not just sex but how you might feel loved.

I also found that sometimes just making out was good too, just a thought. She needs to know that not every touch from you means sex, ya know?"
"Learn stuff before having an opinion on it.

If I don't know how swaps work, I don't have an opinion on them.  Or court decisions.  Or taxes.  Or election systems.

"The most content I ever feel is spooning my girlfriend.  The rest of my worldly problems melt away.

Also, I'm fortunate enough to have a very smart girlfriend.  She lends me very good opinions on things when I ask her.  This makes me safe in feeling that I am making the right decision with whatever it is.

"Rarely unless she isn't feeling good.  We've been together a couple years and fuck like rabbits.  

Part of the issue I see with dudes is how often they just like ""ask"" for sex and are surprised they get turned down.  It's like...how often are you flirting?  Giving her dirty eye contact?  Touching her and making her feel loved?  Sexting her when you're bored?  Sounds corny as fuck but it should never be an ""ask"", it should be like activity that both sides build up.  And for the other party it shouldn't feel like a chore or some duty they need to periodically attend to.  If you're just humping her leg like a puppy until she relents, you're the problem, not her.

TBH as attractive as my SO is, if she just out of the blue was like ""hey I need sex and you owe it to me"" real flat after being vacant for a while, I'd turn that shit down too.  

For sure some women just throw in the towel as soon as they get a ring but a lot of dudes do it too.  Part of it is continuing playing the game and not just taking literally all of the magic and fun out of it."

"Was engaged, sex came to a screaming halt in the weeks following the engagement. As a matter of fact, all ""work"" on the relationship stopped on her end. She got the ring and the dating game was over. Dumped her 6 months later when I caught her sexting someone else. That was right after last Christmas. 

Now I've been dating a new girl since June. Because of work and distance, we only see each other on weekends and cant keep our hands off each other. Never had sex so great in my life balecause she is enthusiastic. Not sure if its because it's still a new relationship but I can immediately tell that it's a whole different kind of relationship. We are both close to 30 now so maybe that plays a role. "

"Do you live together? Jw

But i will tell you after you get married and have been with eachother for several years, the frost is off the pumpkin so to speak. And it doesnt mean you love eachother any less, me and my wife are actually doing better than ever.

But original commenter said, as you get older, and not even that old happened to me when i hit 30, your libido changes. We went from having sex like 3 times a week to 1 time a week and we are both satisfied.

When we were younger sex was always on our mind but now we have so much other stuff going on that we enjoy doing. So i dont think less sex equals a problem, its just that people change over time and in our 30‚Äôs we arent as horny as we were in our early 20‚Äôs"

"As a female, I agree.  If I know a guy is behind me on the stairs, I just assume he's looking at my ass.  If my attire is a concern, I just let him go first.  But as long as it's covered, who cares.  It exists, people are going to see it.  "

When I was over at his house one night, he had to do this every hour to show he hadn‚Äôt left.

**EDIT:** u/kazakthespacepupper I think almost everybody in his life has tried to tell him this at some point or another. They broke up once years ago and for that brief period he seemed the happiest I had seen since before they got together; less stressed, irritable, and a lot more confident and jovial. He was at the very least a lot more enjoyable to be around. They got back together shortly after and she was pregnant with somebody else‚Äôs baby."

But here's advice I give to the younger guys, because the streets (yes I'm from tha 'hood) tell them a lot of wrong shit: No matter how much you spend on her, you're not entitled to sex. Also, she has the right to say no/change her mind *during* sex. I don't care how close you are to orgasm, if she says stop, you stop. "
"Also speaking from experience; yep. Same thing happened to me, the gf met some new guy at work, started talking about him more and more, texting him all the time, etc. Started putting kisses on the ends of the texts. When I brought it up she reassured me that she loved me and not to be silly, he wasn't a threat. 

A week later she broke up with me and kicked me out of the house. A month later she moved in with him. 

People might tell you to stop worrying about it and give her some space. But I guarantee those people haven't (yet) been cheated on. "

"I recently tried Fortnite, and it brought my age into staggeringly sharp relief. 

I was initially interested because two of my younger cousins (9 and 12) were playing, and they said I should try it so we could play together. I don't get to see them much, so I said ""sure, how much is it?"" They said it was free! Awesome, how could I not try it?

They asked me if I knew how to play shooting games. I said ""Bitch, I was using MS-DOS to run Doom before your *parents were even born.* I made grown men cry at Halo 1-3 because I crushed their bones into calcium-rich *powder.* I've received enough hate messages when playing CoD4 to fill every goddamned erotic fiction book on your mom's bookshelf, and that's a lot.""

Of course, in reality what I said was ""Yeah, I think I can figure it out,"" followed by a smug chuckle.

I downloaded the game, and watched a few fortnite YouTubers so I could get the lay of the land before crushing the spirits eternal of a new generation of unsuspecting gamers.

""Okay,"" I thought. ""Seems simple enough. Land, grab some guns, build some shit, shoot at people. Easy peasy.""

I entered my first game. I landed far away from everybody else, biding my time, hoping to gather plenty of resources before- Oh, I just got sniped. Huh. Okay. Boot it up again.

I landed closer to the pack this time. I grabbed a shotgun and assault rifle. Fuck yeah. I saw an unsuspecting player chopping down a tree. I almost felt bad for him as I approached. I shot him once, grazing him. He turned, and instead of initiating the firefight I was expecting, I swear to god this motherfucker built a *castle* out of *nothingness.* I stared in awe at this monolith birthed from the imagination of this modern-day Michaelangelo, standing in proud mockery of God and all his laws, and then he shot me in the head with a rocket. 

Rinse and repeat for about three hours. I, a man who's never found a game that was too hard, a man who beat the Lion King on Genesis with a broken controller, was getting fucking *trounced* by a bunch of 12 year olds.

And I was fucking *seething.*

The last straw came when a player with a rubber floatation device on his back was running around me, building walls faster than I could destroy them, *encapsulating me,* entombing me alone with naught by my shame and a piddling green submachine gun.

I threw the controller down and screamed, to my empty apartment (and my very confused dog), ""THIS IS BULLSHIT, JUST BECAUSE I'M AN ADULT WITH A JOB, AND NOT SOME FUCKING 13 YEAR OLD LOSER VIRGIN WHO CAN SIT AROUND ALL DAY PLAYING VIDEO GAMES oh god im old.""

I sank into my chair and replayed all those old hate messages in my head. All the times I had laughed at my opponents. Toyed with them. Sated the gnawing hunger of my cruelty on the nectar of their freshly shed tears.

I understand now.

Trying not to look like a creep, I looked to my manager purposefully as I spoke to her. As soon as the front woman had disappeared, my manager exclaimed 'YOU COULD SEE HER VAGINA'. Good to know she creeped more than me."
I‚Äôm very tall for a woman and I have my height in mine. First few dates I got ‚Äúoh shit you‚Äôre tall!‚Äù  when I met them... just wanted to nip that in the bud but I‚Äôm sure it comes off very ‚Äúonly 6‚Äô3 and over need apply‚Äù

"""A well built physique is a status symbol. It reflects you worked hard for it, no money can buy it. You cannot borrow it, you cannot inherit it, you cannot steal it.

Wait people who don‚Äôt agree with me are still people? 
"When your ears become desensitized (numb) while you're at a concert or sitting on the front row at the drag races, your ears haven't ""toughened up"". You're experiencing damage to your hearing."
Back when I was a child I thought love was unconditional and spontaneous. Love takes a lot of work and effort.  
"This was a secret I kept for about the first 5 years of being together. 

A little background: I had lost a lot of people in my life by the time I turned 20. Maybe not as many as some, but enough to have an effect on me. My uncle, 3 grandparents, one friend, my best friend, and a two people I would loosely call a friend. I wasn‚Äôt obsessed with death, but I think at the heart of it I never learned how to deal with that kind of loss at the time. On top of that, these were people who made me feel connected to a world I had a hard time connecting with. It was like I was supposed to be a sociopath through a series of traumas instead of 

So once I started planning my girlfriend‚Äôs proposal, I was certain that she would die in the next few days. It brought on a lot of anxiety, and I tried to plan out how I would ever move on. I proposed, and just braced for it to happen and prayed it wouldn‚Äôt be something that happened right in front of me. 

The same thing happened when our wedding started approaching. The honeymoon was fun, but I just knew at every car horn or loud noise that her time had come and I was going to be left alone to figure out how to carry this burden. 

Then it was just around the corner constantly. Every time she got out of work late without telling me. Every time she was driving home and her phone lost our call. Every time she was out with friends, and a police car pulled on my street. 

I used to think ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt have her for much longer, so I had better try and be the best husband I can be. That way I‚Äôll have less to regret when she‚Äôs gone‚Äù. I would channel that anxiety into cleaning the house and doing various chores for her. I‚Äôd grab her plate and put it in the sink as soon as she was done eating, and she would fight me on it because I wasn‚Äôt even done eating. 

Then one night she asked why I always tried to wait on her hand in foot and I looked her in the eye and told her in a cold voice  it was because I knew she would probably die soon. She busted out laughing and I started to cry. We talked about it for days and I started going to therapy. Now I pull her location up on find my friends and see she‚Äôs at her favorite restaurant- which is next to a hospital- and I‚Äôll send her a screenshot and laugh about her food being so good it put her in a coma. 

I‚Äôm glad I went to therapy too. Earlier this year she gave birth to our first child and she almost died twice. I think that would have made me go insane if I had never dealt with those obsessive thoughts. We have been married 10 years now, and if I ever lose her I know I‚Äôll be okay.  

Edit: woo hoo! Gold! I definitely didn‚Äôt think my story about being worried would have resonated with so many others. "

"Casually i will feel really awful, like a globule of every negative emotion you can imagine. Nothing could help me overcome this state and it would last for a day up to a week.

"I saw the lead singer of a rock band wearing a bandana in his rear pocket during the early 1980‚Äôs and I thought it looked cool so I started doing the same thing.

Suddenly all these gay guys were hitting on me everywhere I went.

At one point I was in a department store standing just inside the dressing room with the door open.  A guy asked me if there anything he could do for me so I thought he worked there.  I said well I‚Äôd like to buy another pair of these type jeans but I don‚Äôt see them on the rack.  He immediately dropped to his knees unzipped my pants am reached inside to show me a tag with the model number of the pants.  He then looked up at me winked and licked his lips.  I‚Äôm pretty sure he didn‚Äôt even work there.

I went to visit my girlfriend at the car rental office where she worked and there was a guy she worked with and he asked me if we could get together to play ball sometime.  I was trying to be nice and said sure.  So he proceeds to say he‚Äôs a catcher and wanted to know if I ever pitched.  Being completely oblivious and thinking he was actually talking about playing ball I said well it doesn‚Äôt sound like it would be much fun with just the two of us.  He insisted that it would be.  The whole thing was a bit creepy but I was trying to be a nice guy to my girlfriends coworker.  Guys usually don‚Äôt ask guys they don‚Äôt know if they want to play ball.  So as soon as I left he proceeded to tell her I was gay, etc. etc.  She came home and was furious and accused me of being gay and wanted to know if she should break up with me so I could be with him.  I was perplexed.

Well it was all a very weird experience until I discovered that wearing a red bandanna in the back pocket was an indicator that I was gay and apparently into fisting.

Of course I was completely naive about such things and was 100% clueless as to why suddenly I was a magnet for gay guys.

Bandanna in the pocket phase was a learning experience.

EDIT: I just looked up the ""hankie code"" as one of the comments below called it and apparently I was telling people I was into being on the receiving end of fisting.

"I of course don't know what you look like, but yeah I will be real appearance and popularity do generally go hand in hand. The guys in my friend groups who are the most popular and have people constantly wanting to be their friend are by far the most attractive ones. Otherwise confidence also plays a role. People who are confident tend to also get people gravitating to them. As a man with anxiety that is generally my biggest hurtle to overcome when trying to make friends. "
"I will probably get downvoted for it, but it's a truth that people hate to actively admit that being attractive tends to make you popular by default. This is true for both guys and girls, but it's even more pronounced for girls. People who are average looking or below tend to have to work harder at finding friends or romantic partners. With all that being said being nice is a virtue that is much needed. Looks fade, but being a friendly person lasts a lifetime. "

**starts running up the stairs while screeching.**
And once during the date.
"It's kind of a red flag that she is keeping you out of the loop here. ""Work-spouse"" type relationships are one thing, but all the texting and hanging out one-on-one during personal time is a bad sign. I'm a single guy who happens to be good friends with a number of women who are in relationships/married. I'm also good friends with all of their boyfriends/husbands, and we do group stuff together (group hangouts, game nights, group chat on messenger, etc.). I might spend some one-on-one time chatting with one of them at a party or something while their SO is off doing something else or couldn't make it, but I wouldn't constantly send them private messages or ask them out on basically a date. Even if it's not ""wrong,"" there's definitely a weird vibe to it. Your girlfriend should know this, so the fact that she *keeps* reciprocating and accepting his invites is bad form on her part. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, having a problem with a girlfriend's male friends will often be discounted as controlling behavior and/or insecurity on your part, even when it's justified. You can blame the abusive and controlling assholes out there that really do overreact for that. "
"Assuming you are a female:

Get somebody to put your finger in their mouth and simulate a blowjob. Then close your eyes and imagine that is arouses you in a similar way as good clitoral stimulation. That's about it. Remember to thank them for it."

You can always try to talk to her about it, but you'll need to remember, those are dates and someone respectful to their relationship doesn't go on dates with other people. That's not opinion, that's fact. The question will be does she acknowledge the fact once confronted with it, or will she try to make you believe in a fantasy world where the fact is not true?"

Me and my fianc√©e do this. We love each other and are both ""givers"" in our relationship. We will likely be together forever. I'm sick of people who judge us for having ""old timer"" ways like we are doing something wrong. There is no injustice or unbalance in our relationship. But everyone (mainly her friends) talk down to the two of us because I flat out don't fold clothes. I expect my fianc√©e to take care of it. That apparently is somehow ""wrong"" of me. But no one bats an eye when she says it's expected of me to fix the car or mow the lawn. because ""he's the man duh"". 


It is assumed I expect these things of her because she is a woman. When in fact I expect them because she accepts that it's her chore and if shes folding laundry you can bet your ass i'm cleaning or fixing something. She's working, i'm working. We play, work, and rest as a team.

"A long time ago, I was dating a nice woman and we were at the stage of our relationship where we still had our own places, but we spent all out time at her place. I was like 20.

Out of nowhere I cam down with chicken pox, which I'd somehow missed as a child. Adult-onset chicken pox is no joke, it was the sickest I've ever been in my life.

I found myself covered in stinky blisters, soaked with fever sweat, absolutely miserable and helpless. She was right there for me, perfect and sweet, keeping me hydrated, medicated, fed, and clean, while all I had to offer her was me being dependent, unattractive, and unwell.

It took about a week before I was myself again.

"Dated a lovely woman that was exactly twice my age. I was 25 and she was 50. She‚Äôd been through a terrible, abusive marriage, and had 3 grown children, 2 of which were older than I. Her ex and her kids treated her like shit and unfortunately she let them. Together we made a life running a business together that was successful enough for us to afford 2 homes, 3 nice cars, and a 30+ foot house boat. Eventually I realized that while I had a damn good life, I was not happy. Age is not just a number. It eventually gets to the point where you can see the huge difference. I got tired of the Mom jokes and I was totally out of my element when her kids visited. I hated how they treated her and it became a source of contention for us. Sexually, we were great at first, but that changed quickly as she went through menopause.  She was no longer interested in sex and I was a raging 30yr old by then. We started sleeping apart because her ‚Äúback hurt‚Äù and I was just so comfortable with my life that I didn‚Äôt protest. Things really started to fall apart when I was getting closer to 40 and realized that she just couldn‚Äôt keep up with the things I wanted to do in life. I was taking care of her more and more and I started to resent her for it. Eventually I realized that unless I left I would be miserable.  I told her when I was 38, after 13 years together, that I thought it was time for us to part ways. One of the most difficult things I‚Äôve ever done. She was totally devastated. So much so that I almost stayed, just to make sure someone would be there to care for her as her health failed. I begged her to become self reliant and moved out after 6mo. of trying to help her settle her life apart from me. I moved out of state and told her idiot kids that they needed to help her. That‚Äôs the last time I saw her. I left her with everything. Both the houses and 2 cars and the boat, also the business we‚Äôd built together. Financially she wouldn‚Äôt ever have to work again. I started over with a pickup truck and about $2k in the bank. 

TL/DR. Age matters a lot. Don‚Äôt kid yourself and if you don‚Äôt want to work amazingly hard at keeping it together don‚Äôt start it. "

"The woman who cuts my hair is 5'4"" and weighs around 200lbs. She posts multiple full-body pictures (non-selfies) on her OKCupid profile and she has a date every night of the week. She doesn't call herself ""curvy"" but instead the term is ""big"" as in ""I'm a big girl and I don't lie about it. What's the point?"" 

Sometimes she gets rude messages about her weight and she pisses them off with a response like ""Why did you write to me if you don't like what you see? You obviously have no life and I'm not interested in dating a guy with no life."" 

60% of the American population is overweight and 30% are obese .. fat people get plenty of dates LOL I don't know why redditors act like fat people are sitting alone at home crying their eyes out. They're out on dates, at clubs, living their lives just like anyone else. "
There worst part about this is that 1 asshole can turn 5 others into assholes. 
Send it over and I'll do the research for you mate x
This will be the post she finally reads of mine...I‚Äôm pretty much questioning everything about my life right now. 
"Once, when she was fighting off the flu. She changed her mind and ended up having sex anyway though."
"You just do. If you don't throw yourself off a freeway overpass, then life goes on, and memories fade, and new opportunities arise, and before you know it you're someone different from who you were."
"Reddit will be the first to say cut contact/end things. You know the situation better than anyone, so do what you think is best."
that I didn't want to have sex with them
I'd take that even without sex.
"Literally no upside, especially if you're young"
Weed doesn't solve all problems. 
If you just started taking to her and she already sent you that she's probably cray. Don't put your dick in cray. 
"Yeah you're not wrong. I've noticed the same thing, where reddit will say the best way to get a girlfriend is to start treating women the same way you treat men. But somehow, talking about classes and video games doesn't seem to make women hot for me"
"No sex sucks. But I'd rather have a lifetime of no sex than lose getting hugs every day when I come home by an excited toddler screaming ""DADDY!"". 

There is a lot I'd suffer through for him. An empty house is not worth all the sex in the world."
"I dunno, I remember being that poor as a kid. I worked a shitload of hours once and when I got my check I had  only netted like 50 dollars more because they taxed me more. So I do get the argument. "
"Sure you are 
&gt;kushmaster10"
Straight male reporting for duty. I appreciate a sexy body no matter who it belongs to!
"It depends on how angry she is and for how long. There's a lot of ^^^^probably ^^^^single dudes in this thread who are saying she's nuts, this is bullshit, you should break up with her. I mean, if she dwells on it for hours, then yeah, she's off her rocker. But you gotta give her a bit of slack - dreams feel pretty real, sometimes. Her *feelings* about it are real, even if the *event* wasn't real. She just wants some reassurance, and if you're not glad to give her any then you really shouldn't be in a relationship in the first place. Just give her a hug and a back rub, she'll be fine."
"Reading through these comments its as if these people have never had a relationship. Is this a valid reason to be mad at OP? Of course not, and the vast majority of people will recognize that. But she's still mad. Is it really that hard to comfort your SO even if they're being irrational? Just reassure her. That's all she's really looking for. Don't tell her to fuck off, don't tell her it's her problem, don't tell she's immature. You're only going to make it worse. 

Jesus Christ people get it together."
"I feel this so much.  Had a rough one myself in '10.  I've woke up in less than favorable ways, but she's always able to pull me out of it.  Like a ray of light among the storm clouds. 
"
"""Wtf, why would you send me that, pervert."""
I'm single and have never been on a date; all I really want is some to cuddle up to or hold hands with.
When they're pretending to be dumb or ditsy. It's so easy to see through. 
............. Reddit?
"your wife\*

a bit confusing, haha."
Yesn'tn't
"My wife is some sort of sex witch where everytime we have sex, regardless of where we start or which position we end with, she ends up with the dry spot"
This made me laugh more than it should.
The IT department isn't stupid.  They have seen your issue 100x today alone.  And you being in a hurry doesn't magically speed up your computer.
"So like, throw money at her?"
Very rarely but usually because she's tired. She makes up for it in spades in the morning.
Never shop on a empty stomach 
"Because (most) guys want the right amount of curves, while the women doing this tend to think quantity over quality."
"Trash talk their wives. Like bro, she's *your wife* - it just reflects badly on you that you were forced to settle for such a terrible woman. I cannot stand ""ball and chain"" jokes, references like ""her highness"" or ""SWAMBO"" (She who must always be obeyed) etc. If we as men allow other men to keep denigrating committed relationships and marriage in this way, it will be no good for our own wellbeing or society at large. Men have little enough incentive in terms of social status and respect to get married or have kids, and allowing other men to be complicit in the dismantling of the social institutions of fatherhood and groomhood is just bullshit IMO."
I nearly forgot. Thanks for the close call.
"I‚Äôm back in college (23) and I feel the same. I can‚Äôt stand when the kids next to me wanna talk during class? Like dude I‚Äôm paying $ to hear this person teach, shut up. "
"It's only common in relationships that aren't healthy in whatever way led to them not having sex. My wife and I have six kids, four that live with us full time, and we have sex once or twice a day. Just having kids doesn't automatically kill the sex life."
Œß
Just respond ‚Äúnice‚Äù
That depends on the woman. I keep it classy in public but I think we've all fallen victim to a  Pied Piper booty before. 
Just broke this rule for the first time. Still going strong. 15 years Never stuck my pen in Company ink.  Now I‚Äôm hooked like a drug addict to this girl. 
"As a mom, I forever will now refer to my child as ‚Äúlook what I made‚Äù "
"That's probably it. A 31 year old girl definitely can't ""change"" to being 24 again, whereas a guy can stay competitive in dating into his late 30s. Height and age are a solid comparison. "
She knows she's only got herself to blame if she does it after fajitas night.
"When I ejaculate without having an orgasm, it's a sure sign that my depression/depressed mood is back and I need to see my therapist ASAP."
Age.  There are fewer men who want to date older women (or even same age women) than vice versa
Because nobody wants to hear about our problems. They want us to achieve their goals and they don't really care about our wellbeing.
"I have been on a lot of tinder dates and from what I've gathered, some people actually ***don't*** do it on purpose, they just pick the photos that they like themselves the most in. It's actually kind of sad. Sometimes I'll see a girl that clearly is framing her photos to hide her nose or ears or whatever and half of them don't even realize that's what they're doing. They just don't like how they like most of the time."
"The university I go to offers a ton of different workout classes every single day at the Rec center, so I started trying as many classes as I could to see what I like. At this point, I do yoga, aqua cardio and cycling classes twice a week, along with playing basketball for a couple hours at a time occasionally. And I'm on four different intramural teams so I'm working out one way or another at least six days out of the week.

Yoga is really cool to me because it's actually difficult and really relaxing at times. Working on your balance, breathing techniques, doing stretches and doing meditation at the beginning and end of class just helps me in a lot of different ways, personally. It definitely felt awkward the first couple times I went, but there's just something about it that keeps bringing me back "
"Turns out you can get long lasting boners if you injure your lower back, at least that's what some yoga practitioners in some yoga forums told me."
High school
"Ill probably get A LOT of shit for this one but....

Eating dogs and cats is no different than eating cows or pigs..."
I find it hard to believe that nobody minded it.
Them being manipulative
Definitely traffic. Especially screaming at slow drivers on the passing lane. 
Stare at that ass so hard you can you use their mouth as a periscope. 
"Masturbating when I get bored at night, at home. Happens quite a lot actually."
"sounds like my relationship.  Sometimes one or the other isn't into it, but we do it because we know it helps our partner feel good.  It's not about being taken advantage or, its about making our partner feel good, and the chemicals released in the brain after engaging in sex really makes it all alright in the end, so there really aren't any regrets either.  "
I agree with a lot of people here in the full body shot.  No better way to tell that a woman is fat then when she only includes face pictures.
"If I don't want to do something, I simply say ""no thanks"" and don't do it. No more excuses, no more doing things just because someone else wants to.

*Does not apply to certain obligations "
You don't tell me what to do
God damm this is a risky username. Hows that working out for you
"This. 

I've had dreams where my boyfriend betrayed me in some way which felt so scarily real I didn't feel right for hours after waking up. 

Unless she's actually arguing with you or something, she isn't being stupid, she just had a dream which shook her up a bit. It happens. Calling her stupid will only make things worse. 

Some cuddles and reassurance go a long way for situations like this."
"Equality is not the same thing as equity.

My boss took me out to lunch today. Had to toss my leftovers and not mention it. He gets sour over how much better my job is than his. I know he had a crappy day at work so I didn't want to rub it in that I had a relatively chill one with lunch out instead of microwaved 3 day old leftovers.
And then whisper the same phrase over and over again until she's done.
close enough
"Tinder. Literally only had it as a joke and never used it seriously and never spoke to the few matches I got over 3 months. Then one day a good friend of mine said he matched a girl that went to the same school I used to go to and that she‚Äôs pretty hot and he might try and go for it. I checked my tinder and saw I matched her as well then basically told him to ‚Äòfuck off cuz she‚Äôs mine‚Äô as a joke sort of thing. I wasnt looking for anything as I had decided to avoid relationships and work on myself first, but I sent her a message as part of the joke. Turned out to be the most amazing girl ever and we‚Äôre 10months of serious relationship later"
3D chess
No. 
Are you saying that your roommate would purposely walk in on you and your girlfriend?
"I just saved the second one to add to my collection of ‚Äúunsolicited dick pics‚Äù. Thank you kind stranger. 

Also I dare not send politicians in that category "
Freedom of speech doesn‚Äôt equal freedom of consequence of said speech. 
"It's so infuriating. Here's a hundred assholes creating a traffic jam out of nowhere, and they get mad at you for not taking part...."
"I went to an all boys school, we did something similar but it was called brawl and detention"
I like this policy. 
"Dude... This is freaky. We never formally agreed on it, but this is my relationship with my wife of 30yrs. 
We just grab each other all the time. It results in sex usually three or more times a week.
People love to be desired. If you both play grabass games like that, it reminds you both that you‚Äôre still attractive (and attracted).
No better aphrodisiac than that."
"That‚Äôs pretty fucking funny. 

‚ÄúOh Oh Oh Oh Fuck Oh Oh‚Äù

*enters room*

‚ÄúHey guys‚Äù"
It is nice.    The wife slept topless with me last night.    No sex but very comforting.    I call it the healing power of boobies.
"Inward, for the presence of Jesus."
But then nothing would get fixed and that makes me sadder than what sex can do to make me happy
Roll tide
"What I don't understand is why everyone collectively decided on whatever the alternative to zipper merging is. If we all zipper merged, there isn't really any way to cheat. Instead we all decided to do something that allows people to skip ahead, and then we get mad when people do..."
"Yikes. Do not marry that woman, it will only get worse. "
When I think about you I touch my shelf!
"Even those of us who enjoy that cringe at that porn. It is definitely not fun on those sets, and you can really tell that in the end product. "
"I think I meant to say how there's the whole thing about (obvs, not all) women wanting a certain height range in men, and belittling the rest, while they criticise men for not preferring fat, or at the very least, overweight women. Sorry if I'm wording it wrong; I'm so tired üòÇ"
"Rarely, only in situations where she's sick or she's too sleepy (same applies for me), but usually I'd notice that ahead of time. I'd say we go maybe one or two days a week not having sex."
"[Follow the three rules.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krHKxPzl2-A)

1. No balls.
2. No mass texting.
3. Never show your face."
"I've said it before, but I had just finished mountain biking during some really crap conditions. I was dirty with mud, and my hair was a mess. I biked down to the market, went to the soda/juice I'll to grab a drink, I passed some by some girls about my age (18-19 at the time). One of them giggled and said,""Isn't that guy with the yellow shirt like really cute?"" Another responded with, ""He looks pretty hot.""

I was never popular with the ladies but that day, I figured I might be at least a 6/10 when I am full of dirt. "
Aw that's such a sweet story! 
"Being there for me. Not judging me when I am emotional. Being thoughtful and understanding. 

I'll tell you what didn't work. On three separate racist encounters (two violent), my ex did not come to my help. It broke my heart because our son is mixed. "
"More like nobody dared to say anything about the creepy kid, so he took that as silent permission."
"If you can do oral while engaging in PIV, you've won at sex.

Also, you might want to get that spine looked at."
*Tormund disliked that.* 
"&gt; Any more stories like that?

My ex-wife hit her head one time when we were on vacation. She woke me up to tell me she hit her head, ""Are you okay?""

She told me she was fine, so I went back to sleep.

The next morning, I wake up to find out she's been awake most of the night... angry at me, because I didn't get up, get her a bag of ice, and ""tend to her needs.""

""Did you get up and get a bag of ice for yourself?""

*No.*

""Then I guess you weren't hurt that bad.""

She was furious.

/that's what our marriage was like; she invented things to be angry about, and then blamed me when I wasn't ""concerned enough"" about them."
"The quote usually ends that women are afraid of being killed not beaten to death but it's usually credited to novelist Margaret Atwood. She said it during a lecture, after asking a male friend what men are afraid of from women and then asking a class of female students what women fear from men."
"I am having difficulty correlating the two.

Are you ok?"
"What if she's wearing a short dress?

Look lady. I gotta look where I'm going. Nobody forced you to wear a thong and 9 inch skirt today...."
A booty who's siren song leads men to their doom. 
"I walked by a girl the other day and she gave me a slight angry face followed by a low growl, made me question a lot of things including my appearance"
I would love to hear some of the salt. It's only fair though right? 
"‚ÄúHi! I‚Äôm your date.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sorry she‚Äôs a skinny woman.‚Äù"
"That‚Äôs hella impressive, how did you do it?"
"That's what everyone misses, it doesn't matter how much you fuck as long as both parties are satisfied. If once every few months works for you, great! If it doesn't then talk to your partner and work it out, if you can't be honest about that then you need to take a look at your relationship, your needs are something both of you should care about and vice versa."
"More cuddles, less stubborn, none of covering her body"
Sometimes she sucks dick so good you catch feelings
This needs to be the top comment! I have tried explaining this to my husband and he just doesn't get it. Asking does not get me in the mood and im sure theres plenty of women who feel the same.
"And if the kid doesn't come before, you got a crazy lady, so abort mission."
