"I maintain my abstinence by fucking my life over and over again, not exactly pleasurable but it keeps me occupied not to date others."
"Toxic relationships under the guise of ""intensity"" and ""passion."""
"unhealthy marriages. The trope of the nagging wife and the incompetent husband. Usually with a joke or two like ""marriage? am i right?"""
"The idea that a woman will eventually agree to go out with a man if he's persistent and ""romantic"" (read: stalkerish) enough."
"It's the answer everyone hates to hear, but discipline. I wasted my entire life waiting to be ""motivated."" The truth is, most of the time you're not going to feel motivated. You just have to suck it up and make the healthier choice."
Jackhammer for two minutes and everyone orgasms.
"The birth experience, especially the portrayal of the first time a mother holds/sees her child as being so magical and there being an immediate bond between them. I did not realize that it was normal to not immediately bond with the baby until a while after I gave birth and it contributed to my PPD. I'm sure there are a lot of mother's who had a similar experience."
"Did you know that most children aren't so afraid of their parents that they have anxiety attacks every time they receive a report card?

Because I didn't learn that until I was 18."

"* Using data - calorie counting worked very well for me because I love numbers and spreadsheets. They're comfortable and easy to understand for me. I enjoyed being about to calculate how many calories my body needed, how many were in each type of foods, and playing with the math to see, hmm, if I want pizza HERE and I'll have chicken and veggies THERE and then I get this total, I have X amount left to play with.


* Along those lines, I gave myself permission to lose *slowly*. My first week was 2000 calories. My second week was 1900. My third week was 1800. My fourth week was 1700. My fifth week was 1600 - oh, but then on my fifth week, I really started struggling with hunger and not feeling satisfied. So that meant I kept my deficit at 1700. That meant my weight loss was slow, about a pound a week. But it also meant I wasn't hating my life, hungry, or miserable on a ""diet"" - it just was the new normal."
"I didn't have any problems with all-female staff.


It was actually pretty great. One hour into my first day, I was invited to an outing (it was fun and there were cupcakes). My third day, one lady got lunch for everyone. By the end of my first week I had like eight new mom figures."
"Personally, I'd choose Arcanine.

1. He is a form of transportation.
2. He is a form of security (makes home and travel safer)
3. He is a big dog!!!
4. He is probably a warm cuddler and is probably amazing when you're having a bad day."
Sorry guys I'm gonna be the oddball here. Every all female working environment I have been in has been horribly catty and backstabby.

"Its ride or die, not ride or decline"
"You can't. Not everyone you interact with is going to like you or treat you with respect. Personally, I treat everyone with basic decency and respect, especially at work. You can only control your own behavior, not that of others."
I hate that so many movies have men aggressively kiss a woman to stop her from talking or worrying. The only thing that’ll get a guy from me is for me to never talk to him again.
I'd like more compliments about how I positively impact others' lives. More compliments about my character and all that.
Keeping secrets as a normal part of relationships. Secrets are a lazy plot device and a bad way to communicate in a relationship.
"I'm terrified of giving my all, and then being mercilessly discarded. What happens if I end up getting roped into starting a family, and then there I am pregnant or saddled with a child, and suddenly he decides i'm not fun, young, and feminine enough anymore? I see men make comments about women with post chilbirth bodies. Everyday men, good men. And I'm always taken aback how casually cruel we can be about it. It's easy to call me beautiful now. It's easy to cling to my body now. It's easy to live in the moment with me now. But what happens when my breasts look like those of the women you ridicule? What happens when my belly is flabby instead of firm? What happens when I am difficult to handle because I have PPD? What happens when I don't have time for those long bedroom retreats? He jokes about how he will handle it, how he's sure that I'll always be attractive, but I think this a symptom that he doesn't want to face the possibility that this could be my future. I don't think he's ready. I know I'm not. I see marriage as a stepping stone into starting a family (honestly what else is the point?). This is what scares me about it."
"Judging from my mistakes, if you're in an area where the deposit is a big deal: photograph everything and *try everything*. Bring a charger plug or something similar and try every socket.  
  
I didn't notice any of this before moving into my flat, only to find a few faulty sockets, a tap that was leaking once the water has been turned back on and a bathroom fan that won't work."
"Did a lot of shit that was really hard, basically. And prioritized myself for the first time ever. 

Built up discipline. Worked my ass off. Went to therapy. Took care of myself. Finished my education and tried really hard in my classes and internships. Ended my toxic marriage and some unhealthy friendships. Took the time to find and nurture new ones. 

It was tough, but it was worth it."
CHEATING.
"When I was a kid I would chew on the muffin paper when I was done. I don’t remember swallowing it - it was more like muffin flavored gum. Then I’d spit it out when it wasn’t sweet anymore.

In my defense, my mom didn’t let us have a lot of sweets."
"Parents who had pretty much zero interest in you as a person or your life. Going over to friends' houses and seeing their parents actually talk to them and express interest in them was really weird. I always tried to convince myself that it was super cool to not have parents breathing down your neck and placing restrictions on you, but I was never truly happy with having disinterested parents. And I know now that growing up in an environment like that really messed up my self-image, leaving me thinking that nothing about me matters, so it's hard for me to fight for and defend myself (it always makes me feel deeply guilty and ashamed for having wants and needs and feelings) and other things like that. I also don't tend to even think of asking for help, not out of a sense of pride or anything, but because I learned that help isn't ever going to be there, even if you ask for it. So if I can't do or fix something myself, I have to just accept my new normal.

Turns out it's really hard to fix something that's so deeply baked into your brain."
"Having a child. I thought I felt better, but really we just go in circles.  

For some context, we’re both fence sitters. I thought we were leaning towards having one, but now I think we’re leaning against. We’ve talking above this for a year. I just want to pick a side and be done with the conversation."
"I thought I was going to be a receipt-signer at Costco. That was my dream job for ages. 

I currently work in funerals though lol"
"When the main character gets into the relationship of her dreams, then the guy f’s up or there’s some big fight/misunderstanding and they break up - BUT the minute the guy does some kind of “grand gesture” all is forgiven. 

Where is the hesitation? The “I don’t know if I can trust that you won’t do this again” and “We need to take this slow until I know this is what we both want.” Realistically I feel like they’d spend a few days or weeks slowly getting back together, not solving it all within 5 minutes and getting engaged."
"I'm trying to get to the point where I can force myself to go out for a walk when that happens. Whatever is happening in my brain at that point, some sunlight and endorphins will probably help.

"Happened to a friend of mine. She was raised Mormon in Utah. She got married at 22. Sex was awful. He was selfish and unwilling to try. She divorced him, left her faith, was disowned by her family, and I met her in California where she is happy and actively dating."
"Been with my partner for 7yrs. Both female. We were best friends before we started dating because I was actually dating her older sister(I know horrible, but in my defense I was 17) . 

Anyways, things have been really rough lately. Like really really rough. We both were seeing a change in one another that was not good.  We talked about if this was really what we both still wanted and if maybe it was time to step back and take a break and work on ourselves separately. It was very emotional but probably the most mature conversation we’ve ever had. 

She told me she wants to grow with me in the good times and the bad. That she would be by my side no matter how hard stuff gets. She told me if I felt I needed space she was okay with that. 

We both cried a lot. But we both realized how strong our love really is.  So in about 10 days I’m going to fly home to spend a few days with my family and clear my head. She starts seeing a counselor the same day I leave. I’m already in therapy and have been for  a few years.  We agreed to start couples therapy as soon as she’s ready.  

So, yes I feel 100x better. She’s literally the other half of me and I don’t ever want to live my life without her."
"About the sexual-assault rate of women. It started as a conversation about the new Ted Bundy movie, and he was a bit offended at the idea that all women are afraid all the time and I mentioned the statistic of 1 in 5 - he was very quiet for a bit while he looked it up. Then he read about how it's 1 in 77 for men etc. We talked about how it affects the way we live, and the choices that women make, versus what he may do without thinking.  

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't change our relationship - but I think it did affect how he saw some things. A lot of his friends are men, and he has no sisters. So This is earnestly the first time it's probably been brought up with him."
"My mom used to overcook vegetables to mush. I thought I hated them. Nope, just hated the way she prepared them."
That women have to have had some trauma of some kind (usually rape) to then be portrayed as a strong female character.
I’ve always wanted to be a lawyer. Just passed the bar this weekend.
"I don't know if it's because my parents were older when they had kids or what but we ALWAYS ate dinner together. We'd sit at the dining room table with a tablecloth and placemats and eat a meal made from scratch. It wasn't until high school that I realized that for a lot of people family dinners were the exception, not the norm."
"Still going, but I had to cut a lot of people and things and bad habits- out."

"It was about my ability to trust him after he cheated. This was last night, I don't feel better. I think I'm done with being married to him."
"The idea that any average random guy is just going to be gifted his very own 10/10 hot girl supermodel, who has no dimensions that don't revolve around him.

Psyduck. Since I was little I related to him. I get horrible migraines since kindergarten and when he came on for the first time on Pokemon and they said he suffers from headaches little me loved him because he was like me and I knew the pain and no one else cared that he was suffering.

that I've worked really hard. I have achieved things under difficult circumstances which make me feel like the achievements are even bigger accomplishments. I think people can be dismissive and competitive. I would be really happy if someone said 'it's great that you've achieved xyz under some difficult circumstances' instead of making it all about them/their accomplishments being better like it's some kind of contest.
"Check behind cabinets. This sounds weird, but if you can manage to spy into that little crack between the cabinets and the walls, do it. If places have pest problems they will usually spray before showing a place, but they can't get the piles of dead roaches from behind the cabinets. And roaches fucking suuuccccckkkk. Also look at the fuse box if possible and smell under sinks (for musty, moldy, standing water smell)."

"Not necessarily wrong per se, but my parents would cook all the pink/red out of any steak so I thought that it was supposed to be like that and that any amount of pink meant it was raw and would make people sick. Found out in college this was untrue"

"I was in AP with a girl who was frankly about as academically perfect as anyone could possibly hope for.    
Also liked by teachers and classmates alike, kind and sweet and easy to get along with. Just a nice, high achieving girl.    

She got a B on a paper in English once when she sat in front of me and she had a full on panic attack freaking out about her parents being mad.    
I felt so bad for her. I still feel bad for her.     
It was just one paper. A single assignment that she didn't get an A on. She got grounded and punished really badly for it. She was so scared. Just so scared."
"Oh my god, the lunches, breakfasts, random coffee and homemade treats brought in everyday by multiple people for no specific reason. I miss that A LOT"
"Im currently engaged and fiancé and i have never had sex.  Before the engagement, we were fine.  We could be alone together and never go farther than kissing.... but now, my urges are so much stronger.   We have decided to limit ourselves to public spaces.   For example, before engagement, i believe that we're could have rented a hotel for a break in a long trip and been completely fine sharing a room.  Now,  no way.  We would have sex so quick If we were alone.  

To be honest, i used to have a porn addiction but i had mostly overcome it.  Recently, it's been seriously difficult to not turn to that outlet when my hormones are going crazy. I have adapted by having a porn filter on my phone and if it gets bad,  i leave my place and go somewhere else."

"Starting in 5th grade, I wanted to be a theoretical physicist, and if that didn't pan out I was going to be an opera singer(I went to a performing arts magnet school actually) or front a metal band.

 I did end up getting my undergrad degree in physics and during that I did some research in a theoretical biophysics lab. But professionally, I'm now an electrical engineer which I quite enjoy. And actually I got a minor in classical voice, which I now use in my side hustle as frontwoman of 2 metal bands."
That a day after you give birth you are suddenly flat-tummied and skinny again like you did not just spend 9 months microwaving a fetus.
"I had a really difficult journey with this because I was basically a professional doormat for must of my (still young) life. In a nutshell, not necessarily in this order, I:

1. Lost weight in an effort to improve my attitude to myself (this worked)
2. Sought professional help for my issues revolving around myself (also worked)
3. Read books such as “Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck” to get some perspective (worked)
4. Researched setting boundaries with people (from this point on assume they all worked)
5. Started small with setting boundaries - just tested the waters
6. Once I was comfortable I essentially demanded it from people. I don’t allow people to cut me off, talk over me, or show signs of disrespect (not listening etc). When people don’t respect me I almost immediately cut them off until they prove themselves. I carry myself professionally and proudly, I take pride in the things I do, and I put myself in a position where I can answer “yes” to the question “am I happy with who I am and who I am becoming” through my actions.
7. Very important, i went through a lot of relationships where I wasn’t respected at any level and it was all one sided. Had to learn over and over again what I will and won’t put up with, and to not be a punching bag. Now I have very clear expectations from everyone and I don’t accept less than what I (and what everyone else) deserves.

Respect yourself first, others will come along. And honestly if they don’t just fuck them, showing respect is the lowest form of courtesy so if someone can’t bring themselves to do it they’re not worth it."
"""You're literally an anus with legs, babe. Shut the fuck up."""
"This. Even cartoon marriages aren't exempt (Homer and Marge, Peter and Lois). The wives are ""nags"" but hey, they're hot, am I right?"
"I am really afraid of losing my sense of self. I hear and see men complain all the time about women who get married, have kids, and stop putting effort into their appearance. But what the men don't mention or maybe don't see is the woman doing the brunt of the labor. They cook, they clean, they take care of the kids, and they take care of their husband. I can't imagine the exhaustion and fatigue that goes along with being responsible for all of that and being put down for not having the energy to put effort into your appearance. I don't want to ever be put in that position. I will only want to get married if I know I will have a partner not just another person to take care of."
"This. 

I get genuinely angry when there is cheating involved in movies, most of the time is not even necessary for the plot or the growth of the character. 

Also it's usually portrayed as a brave thing to do or/and the most sensual thing ever, it's not sexy and makes me dislike the character instantly. It's not that hard not cheating, you don't want to be with someone anymore you leave them before the opportunity to cheat comes up."
Making girls think they have to change to get a guy - this rarely happens the other way around. So many films where nerdy guys get hot girls without changing.
"I hope your life becomes as good as your sense of humor.

"Extremely supportive. We are way more open about our emotional state than we tend to be when there are males sharing our workspace (so as not to play in to the inaccurate trope about women being hyper emotional or whatever, and thus less capable). Someone always has chocolate.

We all know a lot about each other's personal lives (all freely shared, of course) and offer one another that older aunt/momma wisdom when we have it to offer; we have a variety of generations. Example: one woman is going through her first period of ""I don't like your face"" about her husband and those of us who have been there and done that are able to tell her that this is a phase, it will reoccur, and ways to get through it that aren't divorce."
Ah yes. I forgot the other important factor. They are hot and thin while their husbands are almost always over weight and average at best

"Not to mention the unrealistic lack of blood.

Just given birth and then they‘ll give the mother their child and it looks clean af and it looks a few months old with no blood whatsoever on it.

"Very specific to my situation but as an ace/aro person I'm exhausted by the constant ""if you're not in a relationship then you've failed at life and if you don't want a relationship then you're broken and you just need to wait for the Right Man to come along and sweep you off your feet!""

"Looking at you, EL James."
"Just like... sometimes when you want to change or grow... you gotta put yourself &gt;first&lt; and it’s not selfish when you do it. And a lot of times you “out grow” people, hobbies, habits, situations, thought processes etc, that don’t align now with the new person you want to be.
So for me I had to cut ties w ppl who didn’t have my best interest in mind, I stopped giving my time so freely, I started focusing on my own happiness, I stopped feeling guilty if someone asked me to hang out and I wanted to be in bed with a book."

"For me the best point you mention is going slowly. It is no use to lose lots of weight and gain it back after you stop a diet you can't sustain.  

This is a marathon, not a sprint. You need to build habits you can keep every day for the long term. Otherwise you'll be stuck yoyo dieting just as I was for years

I had never lost weight more slowly, but also I had never been able to successfully sustain my loss before learning this. The change in the mindset you have when you approach weightloss makes all the difference"

"Offering a more ""positive"" contribution: My mom told me everything. While there are negatives, I always knew what the situation was from how much money we had, what her life insurance policy was, how old she was when she lost her virginity, etc. This in turn has lead to a lot more honesty and openness on my end"
"I actually have a question too: what do you do if when you finally get married and have sex, it's really bad? Or you're not sexually compatible? I'm genuinely curious because some of the guys I've been with...yikes. Thankfully I was able to dump them..."
"Yeah, pretty often the relationships are downright abusive but they're ""SO in love"" that it's okay. Drives me nuts."
"Not having extended family.

"We had this convo recently too. 

Backstory: I rode into the relationship a hard no. He was a ""can't live without em."" We very briefly broke up over it because I was starting to waver and kids with him would be SO much better than with any ex. Problem resolved. Relationship on. Moving forward.

Last weekend, one year into our relationship, he goes ""So, what do you think about *not* having kids?""

Blank stare by me, then laughter. Haha he'd started wavering too. We're independent. We can pick up and go on a last minute trip with minimal planning (I'm a planner, and I have 2 dogs so there's some planning that needs to happen). We have money. We can do what we want.

So now we're both fence sitters and kind of in the mode of ""if it happens, it happens."""
The fact that my best friend married a man she’d known more than half her life and the marriage still fell apart in 3 years. Sometimes things go terribly wrong. But I’m the product of a very happy 35+ year marriage and I really want that for myself.
"My parents absolutely hate each other but they won’t divorce. They both rushed into their marriage at a young age (21 and 22). They only dated a few months before getting married too.

But like they are such opposite people. If you knew both of them individually you wouldn’t expect them to even be friends with each other let alone married. But yeah the household was always really tense growing up. And like I had friends whose parents were the same as mine. And their parents were at least respectful towards each other if not best friends with each other. But as a teenager I always thought THAT was the not normal thing.

Yeah looking back though everyone I know who had a marriage like my parents have are long split up by now. Not still together after 40 years."
"When I was 17, I wanted to wait until marriage to have sex because thats what my mom told me and my culture pushed onto me. I also wanted to be and seen as a good girl. I also wanted to give something special, my first experience with sex, to the love of my life! 

&amp;#x200B;

I always imagined sex would feel amazing, i would feel love, i would experience the amazingness of an orgasm, it would be fun, easy, sexy.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day i accidentally had sex. By accident I mean, i didnt plan on it, i was dumb and thought when he said ""just the tip"" thats what he meant. He did tho, he wasnt trying to take advantage of me. He only put the tip of his dick in me but then **i wanted** all of him inside me. i actually slid down on his dick lol. then we had sex. it was a very mehhhh/ok experience like (7/10). i really imagined fireworks going off, but it just felt very mechanical and dumb and fun. and i remember thinking **lol THIS IS THE AMAZING EXPERIENCE THAT EVERYONE TELLS YOU NOT TO HAVE??!!??!! thank god i didnt wait til 25 or whatever to do THIS.**

i felt disappointed by the experience even tho the sex was ok/good. **i felt disappointed because most of my reasons for not having sex were not my own.**

anyways after my first time, i wasnt even interested in really having sex after that. i didnt have sex for another year. obviously its different for everyone. but i am someone who wanted to be abstinate, had sex once, didnt for a year, then had a sex life that i wanted."
"Having a baby to save a broken/ shitty relationship. Does not work.

(also heavy, reckless drug abuse or drinking. I'm not against either in moderation, but it's a dangerous trope where they show young women just using whatever someone offers them in huge amounts and having these fantastic dancing/ YOLO evening."
I know a lot of the bdsm community was pissed about that series. Multiple scenes were considered abusive by the bdsm community simply because the male crossed the females boundaries repeatedly and the communication was shit between them.
Viewing possessiveness and jealousy as indication of intense love. K-drama and their portrayal of romance did fuck my perspective of love for a while. It took quite a bit of unlearning to understand the toxic masculinity and how one should and should not express love.
"Working for local government in the property department. They’re training me up for an 85k a year job managing leases, currently on 55k. 26 year old female, stuck my hand up to do literally everything I could for the department, smashed through a huge backlog of work that a previous coworker left behind. I’ve been working here four months so far. Before this I worked in insurance. I’m technically a qualified chef, but I quit doing that when I was 20. Left high school at 16."
Cleaning things up as you go along. Save days of none stop catchup
"One time in class (8th grade I want to say) a girl got her report card and was freaking out that she had an *A minus* on it. Several other students and I were trying to console her but it was no use, she was beside herself. Someone close to her pulled us aside later and said her parents were just that strict, and we were all so confused, which soon melted into anger that parents could make their intelligent and hardworking daughter feel like this."
Thru my kids. My best friend is the mom of my sons friend. We met when our kids were in pre-kindergarten together. We just semi close for a year or two then really became close friends. Our kids don’t play as often together anymore (4th grade) but we talk and text daily and hang out often. She’s been a life saver for me going thru divorce now ❤️
It's a haiku if you say it japanese.
"Regular loud, explosive (but never violent - unless you count a few plates once in a blue moon) screaming matches between my parents, my parents and my brothers, etc. I don't remember a lot from my childhood aside from sitting on the top of the stairs in silence, listening to them absolutely tear into each other. They're still married. I do think they love each other, but their love isn't healthy for either of them. Every small off hand comment or misunderstanding turns into a fight.

Being confrontational will always be my #1 deal breaker in a relationship because of it. I absolutely shut down when someone so much as raises their voice around me, let alone at me."
"Also, the recovery after birth which pretty much doesn't exist in Hollywood"
"A lot of bad law enforcement behavior is normalized in movies/TV. We all enjoy cheering for the good guy cop bending or breaking the rules because he's *just so intent* on getting the bad guy! But this trope is so common I can't help but wonder if it's contributing to peoples' unwillingness to hold real police more accountable. We all just have this stereotype in our minds of police putting their lives on the line to enforce true justice, but that's not always the truth."

"Horizon Zero Dawn! It's incredible! I did not think that I would ever enjoy a game as much as this. I've played video games on and off for awhile but stopped about 5 years ago--mostly first shooter or racing games but nothing really too heavy or unique on story. Anyway, started gaming a bit again, and this was the one game that my boyfriend could not stop raving about. Tried it last weekend, and am hooked!"
After reading through the comments I feel like there are so many people out there who forget to question basic things. Why can't I do this? What is the reason for this? Why does it say that? Why is this bad?...
"\#1- Tracking Calories (used myfitnesspal)

\#1a- Buying a $10 food scale and realizing that I was inaccurately logging every single meal.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously, the food scale was the game changer. I eat quite well- virtually no white foods, candy, snacks, fast food, dining out, etc. I could not for the life of me figure out why I wasn't losing weight on a diet that consisted almost totally of vegetables and lean protein. Turns out, I lowballed the hell out of every snack I ate by estimating # of Chips, cups of salsa, etc. I was also vastly underestimating the weight of all of that protein. So i was eating well, but from a calories in/calories out perspective, I was still overeating."
"Ugh, this. The woman is always a nagging shrew for having the tiniest, most easily attainable standards, whereas the husband is a lovable idiot who can do no wrong despite the fact that he's essentially the most difficult of the woman's four children."

"A girl I went to HS with had parents like that. They pushed all the kids so hard. Only one of four ended up graduating college. By the time they got to college they were all burnt out. The one that did graduate, ended up taking six years to do so. 

None of them ended up in the great high paying and high status careers their parents pushed their grades to be so high for."
"Having parents that were convinced the apocalypse was moments away, as was the collapse of society and preparing for some far fetched dystopian futures.

"My (27F) fiancé (25M) only acted weird the morning of. I woke up and he was already up. I wake up to “Good Morning” by Kanye West. If we’re awake, we have music on so it wasn’t that weird, but it was louder than he usually plays it. I get up and he hands me some coffee and says we should go to the geocache a couple miles from the house in the mountains. We went there early on in our relationship. I tell him we can go later because it’s like 7:30AM and I was barely awake. He keeps asking so sweetly I agree shortly later. We get dressed and go up the mountain. He tells me to pull the geocache out. At this point I think something might be up cause he’s “secretly” taking pictures of me but I notice. It’s empty except for flowers and a ring box with my name on it. Sure enough I open it and there’s my grandmas ring. I cried and kissed and hugged him. We’re getting married in 5 months."

"When I was 8 or 9 my grandfather died (my dad’s dad). I’d never seen my dad cry before so I just wanted to be close to him and comfort him in any way I could. At the reception after the funeral I was sitting on my his lap and holding his hand. I guess at some point his distant family members had pulled my mom aside to comment on how inappropriate that was and how I was too old to be sitting on his lap. Later that day she mentioned it to my dad in front of me. While I know this isn’t being sexualized in the way I became so used to in the following years, it was the first time I can remember feeling real shame around my body. They took something totally innocent and loving and made it really creepy. I don’t think I ever sat on his lap again."
No peeing after sex!
"I realized in my mid-twenties that it was not normal to have parents who showed absolutely no outward affection or love towards each other. They didn't fight, but they weren't in love and never touched, kissed, or said I love you.  
  
I thought it was normal to not show affection and emotion and now I don't know how to reverse it."
"The only time I'm ever okay with this trope is when it's about staying undercover/hiding. Don't know why that kind of surprise kiss kinda works for me, haha, maybe because there's usually actual death on the line or something. But just to stop talking or worrying, ugh, yeah, that's bs."
"I second eevee, but the manga version where it can go back and forth between eeveelutions."
"Totally agree. This is bad for men because it encourages creepy stalker behavior, but is also unhealthy for women because it encourages feigning disinterest in order to make men ""work for it"". I've had friends think that this is normal behavior, and play mind games with men who are interested in them, and then get disappointed if the man respects their boundaries and isn't creepily persistent. So it can be a loss for everyone involved."
"That's one thing the movie messed up with in Crazy Rich Asians.

Spoiler alert:

In the book she breaks up with him because of his awful family and their interference. It takes a few chapters into the second book and him making a huge effort before she decides to give him another chance, and if I recall correctly, she sets some solid boundaries.

I found it refreshing that their breakup wasn't over a misunderstanding or overhearing half a conversation, she had valid reasons to not want to join his family.

In the movie she very quickly decides to get back with him, I get it, it's a movie they only have so much time, but I had hoped to see that aspect reflected."
"I heard someone say once that self discipline is self love. It took me awhile to realize how important this is. You can wish and hope that other people show up for you, but you can ALWAYS show up your yourself. It’s crazy what setting small goals and being “disciplined” can do for the relationship you have with yourself and for your self confidence. If you make a promise to yourself that you’re going to do something, show up for yourself. It works wonders"
"One thing I’ve noticed, (perhaps a personal thing) but desire tends to be invigorated when you’re with someone and in the right moment with them. So I don’t usually get intense urges. As for the solution? I think we all know the answer. 

But I tend to get an emotional craving for someone a lot. I listen to podcasts and relish my independence even if I’m lonely, because I know someday I’ll be with my husband and kids and be exhausted and desperately miss the freedom I used to have."

"I had a friend in middle school I thought was super cool. She hardly went to school on time, smoked cigarettes, gave herself homemade tattoos. Whenever I went to her house her mom didn't care what we did, we watched porn and inappropriate funny videos online that I'd never be able to watch at home. She often wore shitty clothes on purpose because she was just so cool and didn't care what people thought. I admired her so much. Come to find out the obvious, she was being super neglected at home, never had clean laundry or food, self harmed, had no guiding adults in her life which is why she loved my parents so much (I thought my parents were so lame). 

We stopped being friends after high school because she moved away, but from what I see on Facebook she is pretty religious now, so I hope she's happy too."

I managed to stay out of any drama or infighting but it required a consistent effort to be friendly but not too chatty, vibe out how deep you can take a conversation with a person or whether you oughta smile and nod, have opinions but not any really big opinions,etc etc, and basically just keeping my head down."
"Discipline is just emotional momentum. You are disciplined in brushing your teeth and walking with shoes outside and shitting in the toilet because not doing any of those things would be gross and upsetting. It's the same with any activity. When someone is disciplined at eating well or going to the gym or journaling, etc, it's because they have 1) identified it as a good habit, 2) marshaled the willpower to break the inertia of their previous habit to try it a few times, 3) observed that it was Good, and 4) consider their old ways gross and upsetting. When I made the effort to floss my teeth a few times, I realized when I didn't my mouth tasted like garbage the next morning. Discipline created 👍"

"I got pretty fat in college and now I'm a standard-sized M/L person. Most of my weight gain had come from emotional binge eating. I was sad/stressed and I dealt with my feelings by eating them away. The rest of the weight was caused by being a bit of a party girl and drinking myself silly one night a week. Obviously, to lose weight I needed to find better ways to deal with my feelings, and also needed to limit my alcohol intake. 

My current lifestyle is based around three reasonably-sized meals + a snack a day, low-key daily exercise, and limited social drinking. I do a lot of yoga, go on a lot of walks, and don't eat like a ding-dong. Being healthy most of the time allows you to celebrate and live it up once in a while."

-Check to see if there is mold in the vents

-Was the house built before 1978? If so, check it for remnants of lead paint

-Is the house near a body of water? How much is flood insurance

-What is it like at night? Is it loud. Do Jerks drive muscle cars down your street to test their speed?

-Are you elderly? Do you plan on being elderly? Find out if stairs are right for you.

-Is the house in a cookie cutter neighborhood where litterally every house is the same model? Ask the neighbors what type of repairs they service often.

-How far is the nearest bagel shop? This matters more than you would think.

-How far do you have to drive to get to a grocery store? Is it a sad Pathmark or depressing ShopRite, or is there a Trader Joe's/Wegmans/Costco/Aldi's? 

-How close is the nearest cult/MLM operation. This can be positive or negative depending on how desperate you are for solicitors"

"I can’t remember the last time I saw a partially or totally uncovered woman’s body in a movie that wasn’t either young, thin, and the product of a personal trainer and carefully prescribed diet, or a “body-positive” marketing technique or fat joke. Do some real women hover around underweight BMI and have no visible fat? Sure. But far more real women have sagging stomach skin, C-section scars, cellulite, and stretch marks. I wish we could see female movie characters not necessarily who are obese or overweight, but who just have average, normal, “flawed” bodies just hanging out by the pool or something and have it be without remark and not some kind of “look at how progressive we are!” ploy."

"I didn't change my name, but 6 years ago I gave away everything that would not fit into my Ford Focus and moved from Chicago to Sedona. Best decision I ever made.

"I was about 11. I hit puberty young, and so I had breasts and hips long before the majority of my classmates.

Suddenly all the boys in the class just *stared* at me. Some would try to touch my breasts. I realized very quickly that, overnight, my friends had become something else. Now, other girls were angry with me for the unwanted attention I received, and boys always seemed to have an ulterior motive.

It was a very sad time for me. Soon after, I began to notice men watching me. It was intimidating, to say the least."
"Also, very much make sure the AC is effective when it is hot out."
"These are my fears exactly, I have male friends that make the same comments. And even though I know they love their wives, it would kill me to know my SO thinks of me that way.

I love the fun, the excitement. I’m not ready to give it up. I can continue having fun even it means doing it alone, I won’t have my feelings hurt."
"Four, but didn't understand it was about sex until I was older. Family friend who liked to tickle me against my will until I cried. He liked being able to pin down a little girl, I guess. My parents figured this out and stopped seeing him. 

Eleven, when I understood it was about sex. My teacher commenting on my body. 

In my opinion this is part of why you should educate your children about sex early on. My parents answered all my questions honestly and gave me age appropriate books about sex, and while they never fearmongered, as a reasonably bright kid I was able to figure out pretty young that when adult men acted weird around me it was because they wanted sex. This saved me from a lot of dangerous situations because I was able to connect ""adult man too interested in me"" with sex rather than flattery or friendship."
"Working at an office with a business casual dress code, a new employee turned up for work in a denim miniskirt so short that it barely covered anything. She proceeded to wear the same skirt to work every single day. I thought, this poor girl, maybe she doesn't have any money to buy work appropriate clothes... though looking back on the situation now, ANY pants or skirt that you could buy from a thrift store for $5 would've been perfectly fine. 

Her first payday came and she turned up the next Monday in... a new denim miniskirt. I also discovered later on that girl did not wear any undies with her miniskirts, when she spun around in her office chair and flashed me with her bare cooch. That was the last straw for me, and I totally judged her after."

"I wouldn’t say it’s a judgement, so much as a fascination. I love people watching, and I find women tend to use their clothing to express themselves more than men. Many women dress to create impressions in other people i.e. want people to think they have their life together, want people to think they are elegant/classy or cute/quirky. And then there are the women (becoming more common as I get older) who dress just to please themselves i.e. they love the aesthetics of a well composed outfit or the comfort of a soft, warm fabric. I love watching my friends ‘find their groove’ in terms of style. That is, find a style that they feel expresses who they are, rather than who they want to be, because they like who they are, and they want others to know them. It’s so nice to wear an outfit that says ‘this is me and I love being who I am.’ So not judgment, per se, more using clothing as a language and trying to work out what the other woman is trying to say (if anything)!"
"intermittent fasting. I eat during an 8 hr window and fast for 16 hrs, drinking water and coffee in the mornings until my window. I haven’t changed much else but I think I’ve lost like 10 pounds without even paying attention.

"We were talking about our future and living together. We met on study abroad, so we will be long distance for a while, because we are from different parts of the US. We were talking about where it would make the most sense to live, where I'm from, where he's from or somewhere in the middle."

I just hated how kids = good ending, not the fact that the couple was together in the first place."
"It was only once but it was one time too many. The first time I ate a tamale, wasn’t sure if you ate the outside part or not, spent waaaaay too long trying to before I gave up. It felt like that episode of the office where Catherine Tate’s character tries to eat a taco. 

Also the first time I ate dim sum I got halfway through a bun before I realized there was paper on the bottom. I remembered thinking “this is good but the I don’t like the texture of the bottom part.” To be fair, I was a little drunk when that happened."

"I've had that experience a few times.  I did notice the dynamics were sometimes different if the working environment allowed for us to work somewhat separately -- for example, an open floor plan where we could all see and hear each other constantly was worse than when we had somewhat private cubicles.

"I work in a private preschool that has a male director, one male teacher, and 43 other female employees including Owner, office staff, and teachers.

I want to tell you this is a positive environment, but unfortunately it's exactly the nightmare stereotype people might be afraid it would be.

The entire office is run by mean-girl politics. Educational coordinators tell you your idea is good, then go to the owner and mock you behind your back. If any teacher complains about working with you, you will be moved to a float position (in-house sub) without being told why, and without offering suggestions as to how to be better. The rumor mill is absolutely insane. Slighting one person could mean getting demoted, not getting a raise, or being moved classrooms very suddenly, without ever being told why. One mistake 3 years ago will follow you forever even though your superiors will lie and say you're doing great. Every lunch meeting with the owner is filled with gossip about other employees.

"I completely agree. I just recently caught up on the last 3 seasons and they fight/argue in a negative way so rarely, that when they did, I felt just as awkward as the kids in the car. And bonus: when they apologized, they did it sincerely and at the same time. Such a great representation of a loving relationship!"

"Making all my meals from scratch. If I wanted to snack, I had to decide whether it was worth the effort of making anything. As for meals, things were legume heavy. Beans are cheap and filling. There was very little dairy.

"Same. 

I didn’t realize until I went to a friend’s house for dinner one night, her mom dropped a casserole dish full of food and I leaned over to my friend to say “uh oh, she’s in for it now” and she was so confused. Her dad asked her mom if she was ok and helped her clean it up, it blew my mind."

"Hollywood has the best healthcare, apparently.  Like when someone gets shot in the chest with no indication that it even hurt, continueing to run, jump, roll, and fight for another hour after getting shot, losing almost no blood, and then being fully healed in the next scene (i.e., the next day) with only a sling on to remind us that it happened."
"Check that you will have control over your own heat.

Ask to see the laundry room. Are there a reasonable number of machines for the size of the building? Check the cost per load.  

Check that windows seal out drafts sufficiently and have locks, or bars if on the ground floor. 

Read the whole lease before you sign or hand over any money. Make sure you are comfortable with all building rules."

"Soooo much farting during pregnancy. Lol. Also, poop happens a lot in the delivery room, and when you try to go afterward it is so difficult to go, some women dont poop for weeks after."
"Yes, I told him.  He reacted better than one could imagine.  

It wasn't really *casual* sex, it was more of a drive-by?  He lived in one state, I lived in another, he was driving cross-country on a road trip, stopped by and we **clicked**.  

He got home from his vacation just in time for me to tell him I was pregnant.  He did ""the right thing"", and we ended up getting married.

18 years later, he lets me know that he wants a divorce.  Why?  Because he had been miserable for the last 10 years of our marriage.  Gee, would that have been good information to have... 10 years ago?  Sure.

I have a wonderful son, he's a great kid, 19 years old and a far better young man than I feel I deserve.  I found out a few years after my ex &amp; I were married that he was vehemently anti-abortion, and then even later, one of the reasons he was so damn miserable in our marriage was my flat out refusal to have any more kids (because I didn't want any in the first place)."

I may on occasion have bought another identical tub of ice cream to replace the one that I ate in one sitting.
This sounds like such a healthy and respectful way to approach the situation!
"I was 21, got pregnant on my first real date with someone (I had known him for a while, we had a lot of mutual friends). I kept the baby and we tried to actually have a relationship. It lasted until our daughter was almost 2. I left him for his inability to hold down a job and be a functioning adult (just wanted to sleep in and smoke pot everyday). 

Looking back on it, I would keep her every single time... however, I would choose not to tell him I was pregnant. We ""successfully"" co-parent, meaning whenever he feels like being around, he takes his every other weekend visitation. I have yet to receive any financial help from him. He continues to be a bad influence on my daughter, who is now 10. 

Through his battles with drugs, alcohol, violence and arrests I have repeatedly requested supervised or no visitation but I am always denied. It is hard work EVERY DAY to co-parent with him... and to top it off, my daughter just thinks he is the best human on the planet. I never say a bad word about him to her... she will eventually find out for herself, but it's a battle everyday. I will never ever be rid of him... the risk you take when you involve someone you dont know well in the next 20+ years of your life."
"I'm a virgin who's still waiting for the right time. He not only expected me to lose it to him, but it had to be *before we could be an official couple*, and then he expected me to move in with him *before we could become an official couple*.

"Watch what you eat, always. Don’t just diet.

For example: if you normally eat a Snickers in the afternoon, replace it with a banana or a regular cracker. You can still eat a Snickers when you really want one, just try to replace it with something healthier for 90% of the time.

Moderate. If you eat a bag of chips every day, try to only eat it on Saturdays or weekends.

The trick is to always try to eat the healthiest. If you do this, you can still eat chips, chocolate, pizza, whatever when you feel like it.

And my rule has always been that when I am on my period, I can get something extra as I am suffering already haha."

Stops her from talking to a close male friend

Gets jealous before they are even together about her hugging a close childhood friend who's male

Makes her sign a BDSM contract when she was no prior knowledge of pretty much anything to do with lifestyle. 

The way that book is written is dangerous for people wanting to start BDSM and basing it on that it horrific and abusive and 100% not okay.

"I used to (and still kinda do) get really angry about the Taylor Swift ""You Belong With Me"" song.
It's being sung by the homely nerdy girl, but if you listen to it... the cheerleader sounds like a catch, like:

""She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers""
In other words, the cheerleader is an accomplished athlete and leader, and the singer needs to get off her ass and find a hobby.

I don't know, it bugs me so much. They're both the worst caricatures of their respective tropes."

"17. Man I live in a good area of the world. 

I’m sure it happened behind my back before then but the first time anyone actually commented to my face about it was 17. I had just left a friends birthday party and I was wearing a short dress and a drunk older-than-me-but-still-young dude said “excuse me, I’m from the council. Do you have a license to be going out on the town with such nice legs?” (I used to figure skate so my legs were indeed the bomb) but I distinctly remember being shocked because no one had ever spoken to me like that before. He was relatively harmless and just kept walking. 

See the other posts makes me feel very lucky indeed, but I also shouldn’t feel “lucky” to not be sexualised at a young age?"
"I haven't witnessed a lot of healthy relationships in my family life, especially as a kid. I saw a lot of abuse, addiction, general unhappiness. It made me wonder why people really even got married. 

Basically, as an adult, the only perk I see to being married is tax benefits. I worry a lot about getting married to someone and us falling out of love or being abused/cheated on or them growing into someone I don't trust or even like and then having to go through the whole legal thing of getting divorced."
It turns me on to have people watch me. Reddit is a good place to reach lots of people at once.
 Old men have hot younger women in love with them. Not impossible but harmful Bc it’s just perpetuates the incongruity between men and women partners with the woman always being in her prime.
It baffles me that people actually boil vegetables as a method of cooking them. Why boil when you can steam (even if it's just in the microwave)?

"Was in the process of divorce, waiting on finalization. Dating around led to a FWB. We had almost nothing in common other than great sexual compatibility. 

One time, condom tore down the side. Thought I was in the clear until my period was late. Test almost immediately popped up positive. 

I never had a doubt about what I needed to do. I was in my last year of undergrad, a single mom to 2 small kids, and I’d just landed a prestigous internship that could not be done while pregnant as it required certain physical abilities. So, I called Planned Parenthood and booked a medical abortion (the pills). Had to wait another week as they had nothing available but the wait only solidified my resolve. 

No complications and no regrets at all. I never told the FWB and actually broke up with him soon after for unrelated reasons (time, distance, and that lack of compatibility outside of bed)."
Umbreon. It would fit into my life the same as any other pet but it would look sick af.
"This thread also applies to most lesbian characters, too! Hate it!"
Apparently I tell my husband I’m going to lie to him before I do. I didn’t notice it until I started using Discord with him and I’d say things like “I’m going to lie to you and say yes” and this one guy always asks what’s the point of lying if I tell him I am so I just say marriage is all about honesty.
"Holy. Fucking. Shit.

This comment just made me remember how badly I used to panic before getting my report cards, and I was a straight A student the *entire* time I was in school! Like seriously I was one of the smartest kids in class, always did my homework, always aced tests, did my work in class and I would *still* freak out as report cards were being handed out. Like shaking as I would open them, and then be bathed in the feeling of relief as I saw the letter A next to each subject. I literally never once got in trouble for bad grades, but I'd felt the wrath of an adult man for other transgressions and I guess that was just me knowing what *would* have happened had I fucked up in school. Wow. I literally never realized this until now. Fuck me.

It also reminds me of a few years back (I'm a grown ass woman in her 30s, so that's how sad this is) I was at my in-laws' house washing some dishes while waiting for them and my wife to get back to the house. I accidentally dropped one of my FIL's &lt;favorite whiskey brand&gt; glasses in the sink and it broke. I immediately felt sheer panic. Which makes no logical sense because my FIL is incredibly laid back. But I still was in a fucking panic about the glass.

My MIL got back to the house first, and immediately was like ""Are you okay?? You look like you're about to be sick,"" and I told her no, because I broke one of FIL's glasses and I felt soooo bad and I'm sooooo sorry and she looked at me like I was crazy. She asked if I cut myself and I said no, but it's totally unfixable and it's one of his nice glasses and kept apologizing profusely. She told me it was no big deal, he won't care, they have a ton of glasses, shit happens, etc., but I was still feeling like my world was about to be ended. So when he walked through the door, I immediately fell on my sword and confessed breaking his glass while trying to do the dishes and he just kinda laughed and said ""who cares? It's just a glass. I used to have a few more but I've broken them. I just appreciate you doing the dishes. It looks great in here!"" And that was the end of it. No yelling, screaming, name-calling, or hitting. I think that was the first time I ever truly realized just how fucked up a situation I grew up in. :/"
I was 22 and he was 28. He wanted someone to settle down with and get married to. He felt I was too young to make that kind of commitment to him and he was right.
"I'd say Absol, we could save so many people by warning them about natural disasters."
"That there always has to be an attractive woman around to chase, where everyone knows she’s attractive but that one guy “wins” her. It’s old, it’s cheap, it’s overdone, it’s inaccurate, it objectifies women. Also having multiple men come after you in competition isn’t romantic, fun, or sexy, it’s confusing and slightly terrifying."
"Parents dividing their biological kids between them (while married and living together). Right down to the point where if you weren't on that parent's team, they would often ""joke"" about you not being their kid. It's hard to explain, but us four kids where divided between my parents, one girl and one boy for each. 

For me it meant that my mom basically treated me like a stepchild she was tolerating, like I wasn't someone she was responsible for raising or who's life she had to be genuinely involved in. It wasn't that she hated me, it was that she was completely uninterested in my existence and everyone knew it. 

Same for my dad and one of my brothers. My brother tried so hard to get our dad to care and in hindsight it is heartbreaking how my dad just didn't think of him as his son. 

But I just thought that was what all big families did to make raising lots of kids more manageable. It wasn't until I was an adult I realized that dividing responsibilities doesn't normally include telling half your kids that they're not yours. On the abuse scale it's not anything too terrible, but it is a family dynamic that is utterly bizarre and surreal to have lived through."

"I always felt the same way when I was a teenager and heard that song, even though I would have had more in common with the not cheerleader girl. She wears high heels I wear sneakers, she's upset with you about something you said but I would have thought was funny, I'm better for you than her in every way... Girly girls are secretly worse than us *real* girls.

It's just the NiceGuy (TM) shit coming from a girl, this time. Taylor Swift has said in interviews that she's moved away from songs like that because as she's gotten older too and matured, she has a very different perspective on not just relationships with men but feminism and supporting other women. Good for her."

"My situation definitely won’t be the case for everyone. But for me, I realized that this was happening as a result of ADHD. I was never able to focus on anything or get immersed in it because only part of my brain would get involved in any one activity at a time. I found some things that I could multitask with that would alleviate it for a time. But ultimately, getting diagnosed with ADHD and having medication was the real solution for me. When I take Adderall, I can actually enjoy recreational things and chores and crafts and all sorts of things."

"So my husband and I were both virgins when we got married. He was for religious reasons. I was because I just never wanted to have sex with someone unless it was the person I’d be with forever. Everyone’s different! Commitment scares me a little bit so I take it very seriously when I decide to commit to something. I was also afraid of being used by someone who didn’t really care about me. 

Anyway, my husband and I are mostly compatible but we have to work together and make compromises. That’s just relationships though. We want each other to be happy. At first we struggled because he has a low libido. It really upset me for a while because due to male stereotypes I thought he’d be trying to have sex with me everyday. I felt like there was something wrong with me. I now realize that I wouldn’t even like that. After I got over thinking we were broken or something, I love that we don’t do it everyday or every week. When we do have sex I feel satisfied and I don’t want to have sex for a while.

But we’ve figured out what he likes and what gets him in the mood. He also has a bigger sex drive when he’s active and healthy."

"I’m going to mention the Twilight series here.  I am a high school teacher who dealt with years of Fangirls who were in love with Edward.  Who was abusive to Bella.  He controlled her, stalked her, abandoned her in the woods instead of just breaking up with her in the living room, and was basically just a jerk.  Girls now think it’s hot if a guy is literally obsessed with them, when in reality that type of single minded obsession is annoying and tiring at best, and dangerous at worst."

I have an egalitarian co-parenting relationship with Most Recent Ex but the only reason it’s egalitarian is because we’re separated and live in separate houses and share 50-50 custody time.  My experience parenting with a man while living in the same house makes me not want to have anything further to do with men except getting the occasional no-strings D with backup birth control.  I am so, so, SO much happier alone."
"Chef trick: you blanch them. You boil them for a precise time (e.g. broccoli is two minutes) then plunge them into an ice bath. That stops the cooking at just the right moment and crucially sets the color. They will remain bright green.

YES. It's so good. So pure. Just me and my cat and my horse making a living on my farm (while also part time slaying monsters and workin' in the mines).
Not op. But if you are stuck with this person for a while...you can teach them what you like. And how you like it. Sex should be a constant communication of what works and what doesn’t. Now I’m not one to talk since we did give into our urges waayyy before marriage. But we have been married a year and a half and it’s still a constant conversation.
"The whole end of the last Twlight movies didn’t make sense. They show this massive battle, lots of important characters die. But then it turns Alice was just seeing the future and that’s what we were watching. The problem is, Jacob and the werewolves play a big part in the battle. 

It’s especially stupid because a massive plot point in the second Twilight movie (literally what the plot is based on) is that Alice saw Bella jump of a cliff into the ocean and she never comes out. So she assumes it’s a successful suicide and Edward goes crazy. BUT in actuality Jacob was there and saved Bella, Alice couldn’t see that because*she can’t see Werewolves in her visions* So Alice shouldn’t have been able to see the Wolves at all and maybe the entire battle even, if she was blocked from seeing Bella’s her out of the water back then."

"Hey, in case you didn't realize, the name for what you experienced is called ""emotional neglect"" and it can be truly damaging. Having underdeveloped self protection, feelings of guilt and shame, struggling with intimacy by feeling like other people can't really care about you, having a negative self image (""no one could ever find me interesting"") and feeling uncomfortable asking for help from others can all be tied back to this.  

If you'd like to learn more there is an excellent book called [Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20556323-complex-ptsd) which I can not recommend enough. Chapter 5 may be especially relevant to you as it is titled ""What If I Was Never Hit?"" and discusses at length how truly traumatic emotional neglect can be despite our attempts to minimize the seriousness of our experiences. If you are at all interested, I would be thrilled to answer any questions or quote sections of the book for you. It genuinely changed my life and everyone I've given it to has gone on to recommend it to a friend a family member."
"  Burning intensity is really intoxicating but personally I found it made me blind to the red flags and personality clashes. My current relationship is a slow burn, and I have to say my absolute love and trust in them turned out to be just as strong, it just happened to be built up over time by really getting to know them and realizing what a great person they are."
"1. Never settle for the first place you see. Make sure to do a bunch of price comparisons and in person tours.
2. Search around areas that are easily accessible to the freeway or public transit.
3. Test out the water at apartments by turning faucets on. Some areas have pretty bad plumping due to hard water.
4. Scout the apartment building for security when on tour. How are the locks? Are there gates? Cameras?
5. Explore the neighborhood of the apartment building. You'd regret living in the middle of nowhere and having to drive 20+ miles for a decent grocery store/entertainment.
6. Ask to see the ACTUAL apartment for rent. Lots of times leasing agents will only show you the model apartment."

I was watching the office
Having my dad completely ignore my brother and I until he felt like screaming at us.
"I didn't even realize it myself. My friend had to tell me that I was being abused, we were 16 at the time. We were on a call and my family was screaming and breaking things like usual and he asked what was going on, then he started to ask me other questions about my home situation. They were topics that I'd never really discussed because I just assumed they were normal and one of those unspoken things. He helped me realize that what was happening was not normal and was a major factor in my depression.

Looking back there are so many things.

I was afraid of the dark so my parents locked me outside at night to ""cure"" me of my fear. I'm still afraid today because of that, it's a crippling fear to have too. I've had to confess it to friends so they could walk me back to my house at night because I just couldn't do it alone and it's humiliating. I've overcome a lot of my fear and can walk alone at night now, but it is still very stressful for me.

My dad spit on me and oinked while he pushed his nose up and would call me a fat pig. I've had my face shoved in dog pee. Been picked off the ground by my hair, had my glasses broken on my face, been whipped, threatened to be killed, you name it.

It had always been bad and got progressively worse every year. I was so close to it I couldn't see the abuse, even now I still am dealing with it."

"Meal prep. You don't have to have a big Sunday cooking fest like some folks do (I, for one, find the idea of 3 reheated meals a day abhorrent), but plan out what you're going to eat for the week and buy ingredients. I usually chop and portion everything on Sunday but still cook day-of. 

Also- give yourself ""wiggle room"". If you're trying to eat 1500 calories a day and you plan exactly that, you're going to end up saying no to a lot of things- like, a last minute happy hour invite, for example- and you're going to be miserable. Plan a few hundred calories below your goal and then either use the extras on ""surprise"" food, an extra snack, or just let yourself be at a bigger deficit for the day."
"Yes I told him. He reacted by asking me if I was going to have an abortion. I refused. I moved out of state about a month later. He called me every week during my pregnancy to check on me and the baby. After our son was born, he came to visit and I realized I had some strong feelings for him. We moved in together 4 months later and we’ve been married 14 years this year."
Had casual sex with a friend and ended up miscarrying. I didn't realize until after I had miscarried and still haven't told him. I don't know how and I think it's too late at this point.
"I've always been partial to Eevee. Idk if I'd want to evolve one, but if I did, I'd prefer Leafeon."
Probably Vulpix for its megacuteness
"Don't forget the rape. Because he totally rapes her. And it's not even a little bit vague. 

The series of events is: He starts to get physical, she says ""no,"" he says, ""If you say no again, I'm going to gag you,"" and then he fucks her. This is all before she has signed his stupid contract or has agreed to be his sub."
"I mean it’s kind of a cop out, but I transitioned. Literally reinvented myself and changed my name, changed my wardrobe, changed jobs, changed apartments, changed friends...very few things and people carried over. I feel much more myself than I ever did before though, and I’m pretty happy these days."
I have chronic depression/PTSD/anxiety. It allows me to say the dark shit I'm thinking without actually worrying anyone.
"I’m at 661 of 900. 73.54% of the way. 

The hardest ones are going to be the ones with Guardians nearby, and this one piece of shit in Lurein Village, where I need to somehow get a rock on top of one of the boat houses, to complete a rock pattern. 

That’s gonna be the one I rage quit on."
"The only time I judge anyone, male or female, for what they are wearing is when it's 35 degrees and they're dressed like it's 90. And it's not really ""ew wtf are you wearing/that's innapropriate"" judgement, it's more like, ""how the fuck are you not cold right now?""

Otherwise I don't care."
Fuck yeah Magikaaaaaaaaaaaaaarp hanging out in its fishtank being all magikarpy
Damn. I thought you were gonna say he's now a stoner. Matricide is super rare
"~sHe'S a LeSbIaN bEcAuSe A mAn HuRt HeR~

Nah bro she's a lesbian because she likes bangin' ladies. If rape and abuse turned women gay we'd have WAY more lesbians in the world."
"“Suicide pact?” “Suicide pact.” 

“🍞” 
The first two that come to mind"
The part that gets me is his inability to be empathetic to how I'm feeling. He called me bipolar because my mood is all over the place. In this situations my mood is bound to be all over the place.
"Apparently other parents don’t snoop around their kids room while they’re gone, every time.  “looking for dirty dishes or clothes”."
So you said you guys lived together before marriage. Did you see each other naked or no? I’m curious if that’s also a “no-no”
This has always bothered me. For example the office is probably one of the best series ever made. But then you realize that Pam and Jim got together because they went behind Roys back and cheated. Even Dwight and Angela’s relationship was based on cheating.
"I feel the opposite way. I had to hit it hard so that I could see results, because every time I tried to go slowly I’d get demotivated. After I saw great progress I’d slowly ramp up to maintenance calories."
You sound incredibly rad.
"I grew up very conservative, learning to condemn other women for their clothing. It's something I've been trying to fight against for years. Especially when I started hanging out with the popular girls in highschool/college, hearing them say ""uh, she should NOT be wearing a bikini"" as we drove past, things got pretty bad.

I started catching myself after college, and I realized how disgusting it was. The range of judgment was from wearing something ""immodest"" (eg. short shorts, crop tops, low rise jeans, etc) to unflattering (eg. hugs in the wrong places, is too short and unflattering to your butt, etc), and it was always cruel. 

Once I realized what I was doing, I tried to catch myself and turn it around by saying ""I hope she feels really beautiful in that outfit."" Because who puts on an outfit intending to feel ugly? So I hope she feels confident and good in what she's wearing. It helped - a lot - but I still slip up sometimes. I'm working on it, though."
For a period of time we had monthly potlucks. It was amazing
"“Everyone notices when you walk into a room.” Something about me having a presence, aura, light about me."
"He told me he was way too horny for me, and that his sexual thoughts about me would end up harming me in the end. We were in high school. And he was a senior. 

Thinking back, I dodged a bullet there. Yikes."
Your friends are IDIOTS. That's what the lemon is there for.
"Brussel sprouts.

Used to eat them steamed. GROCE

1000000x better roasted."
"This reminds me of a movie scene, but I can’t pinpoint what movie and it’s very frustrating."
"I was the one who was slow on the uptake. He's liked me the entire time we have known each other (20 years). He's not sure how long he's been in love with me, but it's been years. Six years ago he made his move... I started dating someone else. He gave up on me, and rightly so. I had no idea his feelings ran any deeper than the typical ""I have a little crush on you"" though. 

Not too terribly long ago, a mutual friend was at his house and my name was mentioned. He then proceeded to go on about how much he liked me, how I made it hard for him to breathe when I was around. Mutual friend contacted me, fresh out of a relationship with an alcohol emotional abuser, and told me W likes me. I said ""fuck it, I'll go on a date with you"" and I'm kicking myself for not going sooner. He's the most incredible man, the butterflies he gives me are insane, and for the first time in my dating life I'm not ignoring any red flags or making excuses for someone. He's just a genuinely good human being. And now looking back I think I've always had a thing for him, too, but thought my affection towards him was of the brotherly kind. I'm happier than I've ever been, all because he didn't give up on a 20 year crush."
"Very supportive, kind of 'we're all in this together'. I'm very happy I had an all-girls education. 

I also lived in all-girls housing for quite a while, and everything was fine until a girl's boyfriend moved in and brought his friend. They cracked the usual jokes about how they'd have to survive the 'drama' and 'cattyness' but the boyfriend ended up being the most nit-picky and dramatic person in the household. He was frustrating to live with and we only really put up with him out of respect for her. His friend was really chill though, although he was very shy (he was a very introverted Physics students. 

Whenever we saw the guy friend we would try talk to him and collectively used to ask each other about who saw him last, how he was etc since he was nice and we didn't want him to feel left out."
When they handed me my daughter after my emergency c-section I almost puked on her head and I immedialy handed her back to the nurse lol. I was so sick afterwards that I wasn't able to hold her for a little over 12 hours. I think people forget how traumatic birth is on our bodies.
"We didn't put ourselves in situations where that kind of activity could be possible. We talked about it, prayed about it, and put safeguards in place to make sure we were making good choices."
Violence against women. Something like 90% of crime show victims are women.
"The calorie count website was sort of an anorexia gateway drug for me that my OCD latched onto hard.  So, I think the first step is to account for all of your physical and mental health issues around food.  When I started marathon training I began the daily routine of fruit in the morning, quick run, fast all day (save for tea and coffee), long run in the evening and then dinner.  Problem is after a longer run the idea of eating seems awful.  This schedule helped my times but wasn't viable.  Best work with a nutritionist to find an eating regiment that works for you and your schedule."
"Abuse, constantly being threatened to get my teeth knocked out for little things like eating applesauce without asking or feeding my stepbrothers because my stepdad would basically starve them.

I just thought all adults were like that, doesn’t help that all my friends were being abused by their parents too. 

Now that I’m grown I’m like... wow assholes never learned how to handle their emotions so they take it out on little kids."
"Well, my favorite Pokemon is Ferrothorn but I wouldn't pick him as a real life partner.

I'll probably go with Totodile. A little gator that I can carry around and can cool me off in the hot summer? Deal!"
"For my post-partum experience, it was more like this:

* Newborn is a newborn, barfs up milk after every feeding
* Toddler older sister loses only-child focus, has fierce tantrums, to the point of vomiting
* Husband gets severe gastroenteritis due to stress, vomits frequently  


I felt like I lived in a sea of vomit that first week. No wonder I wanted to grab the baby, and fly off to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico."
" Worked with all women once in my life. It sucked. It was all drama and judging all day. The thing was, it wasn’t all of them. Just a core group and the others just went about their day. But I’d be hesitant to do it again unless there was a mutual feeling of “let’s not do the drama, eh?”"
"We picked out rings about a month before it happened, but I didn’t know when it was coming. 

Looking back on the day, I was totally oblivious to the obvious. We were planning on doing a low-key dinner and he called me a couple hours before and said it’d be “fun if we got dressed up a little.” Came over to a homemade three-course meal and still didn’t see it coming until he was on one knee with a ring in his hand. 

Sometimes you tell yourself it’s not happening (even though it is) just in case it doesn’t."
"I live in a ""safe"" sort of suburban neighborhood and I was out walking my dog and this guy pulled over and asked me how to get to the highway and as I'm giving him directions I realize he's been jerking off the whole time. This was a Saturday afternoon on a busy street and I had my large dog with me. He sped off when he realized I was untying the bag of poop from my leash to throw at him.  


I bet if you ask any given woman how many penises she's seen and how many she wanted to see you'd get very different numbers."
Men seem like a lot of work.
"It's less of a concern for me because I'm childfree, but now that you bring it up, it is pretty disturbing how normalized it is for men to become disgusted with women's aging bodies, you don't hear the reverse very often. Like, people treat it like a normal thing for a guy to dump his wife for someone younger, ya know?"
"When a woman goes into labor naturally the contractions don’t start out at a level 10. They start out at a 1 with cramps, then gradually ramp up. This is especially true if it’s their first pregnancy. Every movie I see the woman blurts out of nowhere “Omg I’m having contractions!” And they race to the hospital and get there just in the nick of time. Usually the doctor has the woman wait until the labor progresses until they even go to the hospital."
This reminds me of Finding Nemo.
"TV preggos are always just their same body but with a basketball in front. I was most shocked by how my whole body got massive. My feet grew half a size with each of my two kids. I gained a whopping amount of weight (and subsequently lost it) both times. But you don’t see the fat, sweaty, thigh chafe, preggo vision on tv."
"Don't do it. When I saw how my husband reacted to my ruined breasts and genitals, I was crushed. Our relationship never really recovered, it was a slow motion path to divorce."
"We talked about planning a wedding which went really well. There was a conversation as to when to start a family which we both agreed on. There was one about his health which was more for my peace of mind. 

Then there was a long conversation about pinball tables :)"
"I've known that as ""awkward salmon"""
Do you say that last one in public? That would be funny.
What surprised me to learn is that the raw egg is potentially less harmful than the raw flour.
"Omg yes. Birth doula here and have attended many births, including 2 of my own. Not only do films showcase the ""magical moment"" of holding your baby for the first time, but routinely scare the shit out of women for how loud, crazy and horrifying birth looks to be... it can actually be very peaceful and even fun experience- YES EVEN WITHOUT DRUGS. One of my clients was laughing and making jokes in between contractions up until pushing, without pain relief... is this the norm, nope. Is screaming, cursing &amp; immediate, crazy painful contractions after a spontaneous break of the water bag, nope.

Allllllllllllllll wrong."
"I had a mental block for a while. What helps is just being comfortable and not worry about rushing. Try not to even worry about getting off. Of course that is the end goal, but if you fixate on reaching it in the moment, I find it can completely interfere with my ability to finish. I was raised very conservatively and exploring my body was not something I did, ever. Until I met my first SO at 19 and let him explore my body... that's when I slowly chipped away at the mental block. 

Some of the best experiences I've had is where I'm just patient with myself and my partner. I also have to be 100% comfortable with my partner. If the relationship is too new, my nerves won't relax and let me get there. I now have an amazing SO and can get off during sex, which most females have trouble with. So you can definitely overcome your struggles even if it's not always easy!"
"Sportsbra built in the suit, something not too tight, pockets, comfortable shoes. i know this is not part of the outfit per se but hair tied back seems much more convenient than having it fly in my face all the time"
Neither. “I loaf you” :)
"At least do a drive-through of the neighborhood if you're not familiar with it.  

We once checked out a place that looked ok on paper but backed up against a business on a main road.  It would have been loud and crowded with strangers."
"yikes sounds like a red flag. He broke his vows and your trust and somehow you are being unreasonable and resorts to calling you bipolar. I think his lack of empathy and understanding of the gravity of his infidelity will likely occur in him repeating his offense. 

I'm by no means someone who shoots marriages down after infidelity. Everyone is different and has the ability to cope on a different level. However, he's not helping and you need TWO to work on repairing a marriage/relationship. Sorry... I know you didn't ask for advice but it really struck me down to my soul."
"My parents wouldn’t examine every assignment, but if I came home with a B I got berated until I was crying, I would be guilted and sent to my room. The worst part was when they would ask if I wanted ice cream 10 mins later. no, I want you to fuck off."
That extramarital affairs are normal and fine.
"Ex husband.

1. Why do you need toilet paper if you’re just peeing?
2. How much could your incision really be bleeding? After my second c section, on day 2 when they continued to check the rate of bleeding. I just looked at him and said “that’s what you think they’re checking!?” I mean I get it maybe if it was our first kid but it was our second. 
3. There’s no way babies survive on just breastmilk. They eat baby food, just the softest stuff. He didn’t believe me until I made him call his sister and heard laughter over the phone.

He was 30 when I met him so it’s not like he was young and innocent."
I have an 18 year old girl and 14 year old boy. I think that there has to be an ongoing conversation about things like consent and personal responsibility. My 14yo has occasionally picked up attitudes from classmates that will suddenly pop up (spoiler alert 14 year old boys know less than Jon Snow and think they know everything). When one of these comes up we discuss it and I offer perspective.  I don’t think he’s a “nice guy” but I’ve definitely heard something here and there that needed correction to keep him from becoming one.
No.
"I’m not sure how I fell in love with my SO, but I can tell try to tell you what my love feels like.

My spouse is the only person I would give up my life for to save his.  Any pain I would gladly take away if I could to spare him any.  Seeing him happy makes me happy. Love feels safe. When he’s not home, my house just doesn’t feel complete. It’s truly sharing in wins together, when something great happens to him, it feels like it happened for me as well. Love is experiencing something awesome, and wishing your partner was there with you because there’s no one else in the world you would rather share that with.  It’s forgiveness, and trying your best to see their point of view. It’s pulling their load when they just aren’t able to. Love is believing in us, and prioritizing our relationship above all. 

I’m sure I’ve missed a ton of things, but the above if off the top of my head."
"To this day my mother thinks I don't know how to cook because I burned eggs when I was a kid (teen). Reason was I was trying to teach myself to do it and failed. Instead of teaching me how, it just became a joke that Tortitudes can't cook and therefore I have apparently never learned how to cook because of an incident in which I tried to teach myself and failed one time."
I've also noticed in movies the umbilical cord seems to magically disappear...
Holy shit this is so wholesome.
"My mom was usually pretty quiet and didn't really make friends. I always assumed it was cause she had so kids including me. Once we all got a little older she started being a little more outgoing, made a few friends at church.

Well she had one friend she was really close with and would hang out after church all the time talking. Me as a ten year old just wanted to go home and watch wrestling. Well throughout the week my mom would come pick me up from a friend's or whatever and she would say 'oh I just have to stop at Julie's house and drop something off.' I didn't want to to inside so I would hango it in the car playing my gameboy. I fell asleep and I would wake up an hour later and my mom would still be in there talking. Another hour goes bull and nothing. Eventually i went up and knocked and she came to the door and we would go home. This would happen at least once a week, most of the time it was about 2 hours other tomes ot would be 3 or 4 

Years go by, parents ended up getting divorced while I was living out of state. Move back two years later and my mom sat me down and told me she was a lesbian. so now I look back and go....ohhh....."
"""Intense"" is almost always synonymous with unhealthy and toxic. So, ton of ""cons"" there."
"Overwatch, just lots of it lol"
"Entei:
The protection side of things would be brilliant. He's by far big enough to use for transportation. He's ultimately a large all powerful dog. 
What's not to like?"
"First time I remember was 11. Sitting on a porch swing waiting for my mom and grandma who were shopping inside. We were in a college town in the south. Two guys stopped at a red light in front of the store. 

One of them yelled, ""How old are you?""

I immediately felt weird. I said ""Eleven..?""

They were freaked out by that, because I remember them yelling ""Sorry!"" And driving away really fast."
Bloodborne and Star Wars KOTOR 2.
"at a birthday party when we were kids, the birthday kid broke the piñata and my friend dived in and vigorously grabbed almost all the candy only to hand it out to kids on the outside (mostly smaller/slower kids) who couldn’t get any :,) 12 yrs later and she is still the kindest but boldest person i’ve met"
