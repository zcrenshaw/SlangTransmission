A selfish partner. 
"Men are likely to get violent or throw a tantrum when you tell them no.


Women tend to internalize it. "
"Wow,  that explanation makes so much sense. I suddenly understand 😂"
"I found a tick on my nipple! I was sleeping but woke up cause my boob hurt so I decided to just get ready for work. I was changing my shirt in front of a mirror and I saw it! I freaked out. I had to rip it off, lit it on fire and flushed the son of a bitch. "
"Isn’t a 32G a smaller breast than a 36G though? 


Like how a 36B would be the “same” volume wise as a 32D. So to keep the same breast volume, your cup would have needed to increase 2 times, as your band decreased. I spent a lot of time on r/abrathatfits haha."
That's a long time. What did you consider trash?
"Not for pubes but I got an epilator for my legs. I like that you can do it the day after shaving. It's a great alternative to waxing. The benefit is you don't have to wait to grow your hair at all, and then when it's smooth it's smooth for a while like waxing. Plus it's cheap. 
It really hurts with long hair so this is my tip: do it for three days in a row starting 1-2 days after shaving. After that maybe 1-2 times a week, but it will be very easy if you're consistent."
"Ok, that’s enough of this thread for me!
"
Endometriosis
A year. She more or less weaned herself the last couple of months of it she loves her food
1-3 times a day. 
Do you really think that these guys try to attract women who are into fishing? I'm  laughing so hard now.
Every time I shower. Can't stand being itchy.
LOVE IT. Yum yum yum.
"I usually only read one at a time, but I had ~30 pages left to Island when I was going out of town for a long weekend, so I grabbed the Witcher book so that I didn't have to bring multiples with me.  And then I wouldn't let myself finish Witcher until I finished Island, so I just had to wait...and wait...and wait to have the motivation haha"
"Sounds like you've made some... unfortunate choices that your mind has decided to blame on ""societyyyyyy!!1!"""
"Well, I married her, and still am married to her, so there's that..."
"""What is fashion? Why do people want look good?"""
Or maybe just a bot. 
Breaking my kneecap. Or maybe yawning after jaw surgery. 
There are lots of different kinds and each gives pleasure in its own way.
I love both. I feel like both are very different. I feel like PIV is great but very short lasting compared to clitoral and a bit harder to achieve. Both feel amazing but I feel like with clitoral orgasms I can not only enjoy them since they are longer but I can give myself multiple back to back unlike PIV. 
"I wish heels didn’t kill my feet.

They’re so pretty, but hurt like a motherfucker after 5 minutes. I think I’m a bit flat footed. "
"I had the same! Then my doctor recommended vaginal probiotic suppositories. I’ve tried many brands: purfem, probalac, etc. They all work! They basically restore a healthy ecosystem of lactobacillus in there so yeast cannot disrupt the balance. It’s the same probiotic that’s in yogurt, but without the messiness of trying to put yogurt up there.

I use these periodically and whenever I feel a yeast infection coming on. They’ll stop the yes infection if I catch it early enough. "
That is terrifying!  Do they know why it happened? He is ok now I presume?
 i wish yvonne strahôvski played capt marvel :(
"It's great, I like knowing what's going on inside."
"It has never been funny, and it tells you a lot of the person who repeats that stuff even if they are ""just kidding."" "

"Walk home from work. It helps me clear my head of all the crap that's built up over the day, and is healthful, and I've got a good appetite for dinner."
"This doesn’t have to do with you being a man. “Nice eyes” is the same for men and women. Relatively large, well-spaced, nicely-shaped with visible lashes, and typically a color that stands out. "
"Last night, was washing my face and saw a huge bug in the tub out of the corner of my eye. Scream, of course and boyfriend comes running and we squish it with a shoe. That wasn’t the terrifying part. I have to wear a hat for work, and I had forgotten I had set it down on top of my hair ties on the counter. Went to go pick the hat up or move it where it should go, and my blind ass doesn’t have my glasses on so when the little black, curled up hair ties came flying out from underneath the hat at me I thought it was more bugs. Cue me squealing really unattractively, and running out of the bathroom yelling “shit! Fuck! Dammit!” &amp; almost having a heart attack."
"Gaming. There are so many hostile, obnoxious people that I’m completely turned off. I’ll enjoy my RPGs in the comfort of my home and avoid the community, thank you very much. "
"M here and this happened to someone very special to me. What started as random comments from a fellow social media user soon escalated to inbox messages. She doesn’t have a habit or replying to comments/messages a lot and when the user was ignored, he started giving abusive messages and insults on a daily basis. Blocking did not help as the creep kept coming back with different accounts to the point where her time outside social media got affected. Over time, she assessed that staying away from the site/app was the better option than having to endure the creepy troll’s abuse on a daily basis. I tried to help her stop it but to no avail and she ultimately deleted her account. "

"Please no. ??? Yogurt will absolutely not work. Do you have any idea how much sugar plain, unsweetened yogurt has in it? Candida feeds off yogurt. Get 7 day monistat, or see a gyno. 

The bacteria in yogurt do not = the bacteria in a healthy vagina."
"I think one thing all of my close friends have in common is that they are passionate about something. Be that music, climbing, tech, art, or reading, there is something that they love to do when they are free! There is nothing better than to listen to people have passion for the world around them"
Or are avoiding tax...

Umm.... So what happened? Can't leave us hanging!
"He does if we're at a party and someone offers him. I don't because I don't like smoking anything. It would annoy me if he did it at home because it smells, but I don't care what he does elsewhere."

"I found out I was terrified of spiders after once coming back from vacation. I was just minding my own business, relaxing, watching something on my laptop when, ever so slowly from around the corner, this palm sized spider appeared. I tried so hard not to freak out...I even tried to trap it under some tupperware and I swear it *hissed at me*. It darted behind a bookshelf and I tried crushing it, but the floorboards kept that from happening. I called my sister, sobbing, and I swear my top lip (??) was numb. It wasn't my proudest moment when I called my best guy friend over to come find it. He sucked it into the vaccuum, then carried the bag (this was in 2005) over to the convenience store across the street to throw it away and I *still* spent the rest of the night with all the lights on and never fell asleep.

 In short: I feel your pain. I'm actually trying to get over my fear and can at least find jumping spiders cute, but it's still really difficult."
"I was cleaning the bonus room in my house, it became our storage place so everything was piling up with dust and bugs. After, I went on with my day, but I kept feeling a crawling feeling like someone pulling one strand of my hair occasionally. So, I just shook my head to get whatever could be in there out. Towards the end of the day, while I was browsing on my laptop, my friend came by and said I had some white strands in my hair. When she came closer, it soon became apparent that there was a motherfuking spider in my hair the entire time, deeming my hair the perfect place to spew a web to lure in prey. I screamed bloody murder, took three showers, literally almost shaved my head, scorch my hair even. It was horrific. It could’ve laid eggs in my hair like fucking EGGS, and you know how spider eggs are. Like that scene in Charlotte’s Web where a thousand baby spiders “hatch.” Fuck No. I still can not digest the fact the that I allowed a spider to live in my hair for the entire fucking day and failed to realize it. The next time I clean I’m wearing a juggernaut suit"
"Ah, got it.

Internet is not a good place to have arguments/debates anyway lol. Good luck!"
My hair stylist friend says it strains the roots and stresses the hair so makes it more prone to falling out
"Any orgasm I have is just fine by me.  So far as I know, they've all been clitoral."
"Usually nothing too complex - salad, pasta, baked chicken, tacos. I don’t like having to spend a long time cooking haha. "
My apartment
Ya nailed it bud 
You are a serious person and I admire you for it.
"About 5 minutes. I don't cook or pack my lunches. Idk why, I just don't."
"I like the look of cage bras, but between the impracticality, weird burn lines and living in a very conservative area, it's not something I'd wear (at least not wear outside of the bedroom). "
Yeah it really makes you feel like your value to other people depends on your weight or something. Like I know it’s illogical but so is my life lol 
What kind of dishes stay good through a week?
"1. Watch sea turtle hatchlings run towards the ocean.
2. Travel solo and have a hot and holiday fling/romance. "
"A deer ran into the side of my old car and then ran off into the woods. Everyone I tell that to has always been like “suuuuuuuure, a deer ran into YOU *wink wink*” DEER ARE FUCKING STUPID AND THIS ONE JUST GOT LUCKY YOU MOLDY EGGPLANTS 

Doesn’t help I used to be a notoriously terrible driver, and would smack into poles and stuff a lot."
People put in terrible positions they could in no way have avoided. Like being born without eyes.
Really? Not even through assisted masturbation with toys?
I'm going to stop complaining about my cats putting their toys in my purse now. 
All my clothing is somewhat luxurious/designer. I notice it's given me a lot more dominating presence and that people listen to me in higher regard. Self-presentation is really no joke.
"Not so much “pull off”, I just wish I felt comfortable in skirts/dresses. Like I’ll wear a dress when I have to, but I never feel fully comfortable in them and will always go for leggings/jeans/shorts as a first option!"
"Heck yes!! I'm not one to pre watch trailers and etc so my only knowledge is from the few trailers I've incidentally seen while watching other movies.

I'm 4000% about female superhero movies so I will definitely go see it. I'm as excited for it as I was for Wonder Woman, and that's easily one of my favorite movies now. "
"I actually did see a fairly decent explanation for that: guys typically don't take photos with their friends as often (especially up-close ones of the entire body alone) with the exception of catching a fish. It doesn't explain all of them, but just something to consider. 

Also, it's a good way for them to find someone also into fishing."
"Lol i get it - I grew up near my country's capitol, got so use to going there it surprises me when other people say they dream of going there 😂. Yeah I'm trying to keep my expectations low so I'll have a more exciting experience (if i ever get the chance)  but honestly there's so much I want to see and do, I'm sure I'll love it 😊"
"What kind of salad? Do you take veggies raw or do you sautee, boil or fry them?"
"Aww Mate, that's rough, but you're still here and that's what's important."
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** ginaavee! ^(hug)
I'd greatly prefer that. 
"Love is acknowledging all their flaws and faults, their goods and greats, their achievements and failures, and it doesn't change how you feel about them.  You know who they are and as time goes by, a deeper understanding only provokes a deeper love and sense of compassion towards them.  You see tiny things throughout the day and you think of them.  You go to the store after a rough day, intending just to grab eggs, but then see a drink you know they would LOVE and grab that too.

You put them ahead of yourself when necessary because you want them to be happy and see their smile.  You feel peaceful and content around them and are able to be your true self.  You picture a future (with shitty things and great things) and you just KNOW that you would want them at your side for all of it.

Infatuation is fun, it's bubbly, it gets you high with how intoxicating it is to feel.  It is exciting and all-incompassing while you feel it.  But it doesn't always survive an argument or the moment when they're so sick they vomit on the floor in front of you.  Infatuation can fade or grow into a full love (and, likewise, love still has some traces of infatuation in it), but mostly, infatuation doesn't have the depth of commitment that love does."
"Bring Him Home.
Oh shit, here I go. Don't even have to play it."
"This reminds me of my boyfriend.

He was trying to break a cob of corn (for those foil packet oven things) and the knife slipped and he cut his pinky. I got the first aid kit and had him put pressure on it for 15min to see if he needed stitches. He realized he couldn’t move it and felt nauseous so he sat on the toilet. I cleaned up the blood and when I came back, he had taken the pressure off and was googling disqualifying injuries for firefighters. Kind of funny because he was currently in EMS Corps and still couldn’t concentrate on stopping the bleeding.

I had to take his phone so he’d just sit there. After 15min he took off the bandage to check and we saw muscle and blood squirted out, so fast I didn’t see it. So we packed up our daughter and took a family trip to Urgent Care. They evaluated him and then pointed us to the emergency room.

Turns out he severed his tendon. Doctor said worst finger in the worst place. He had to have surgery to reattach the tendon and physical therapy. It’s still thicker than the other fingers and kind of stiff. What made me laugh is when we got home, he still wanted to eat the corn 😂"
Carl is my ex boyfriend's name and I can imagine that he keeps reappearing as a nasty red spider in someone's shower. I completely support you in your hatred of all the Carl's in your shower. Stupid Carl indeed. 
"I probably average about a half hour, but it's more like I take 1-2 hours on some days and then other days I eat leftovers or really basic meals (like a piece of fruit for breakfast or a sandwich for lunch). "
"I love the current state of ""cool girl""/""Instagram baddie"" clothes- I think they're edgy and fun and the exact opposite of the Abercrombie clone garbage that was cool when I was a teenager.

But, I'm 30 and feel like a massive dork trying to pull it off. "
I put all of my liquid cosmetics in the TSA-approved ziplock bag.  It's less than 3oz so it's no problem to fly with it.
"Supermarket Flowers- Ed Sheeran

"I'll check the batteries, all apartments/homes legally come with them here. That's terrifying, but maybe less terrifying than the alternative."
"For me, personally, I can tell I love someone when I go out of my way to do nice things for them all the time, nonsex-related. Infatuation, to me, is purely carnal."
Yeah.. I used to black out from my sleeping meds and will not remember anything fifteen minutes after taking it. I specifically told him not to do anything with me after I take my medication and he didn’t listen and took advantage of me when I couldn’t give consent. Multiple times. I eventually called the police on him but I didn’t press charges because I was a foreign student and didn’t want to get torn apart in court. 
"I feel like an idiot for not knowing/thinking about getting one! I’d go in for a hair trim maybe once a year in Florida whereas here I am meticulous about going in every three months because of how dry it gets. I’ve got a good routine for my face, so that stays pretty moisturized, though my lips do occasionally suffer, but my hands/rest of my body are just sad. I’m so embarrassed when people see my hands this time of year :/"
"Umm question.. I read all the posts and which one are you referring to about the person not having boobs? How would we know unless they specifically stated such? If it’s about the gym partner, he could be trans for all we know, or just be educated on hygiene issues.

I’ll tell you, being a woman (or having boobs) does not make one an expert in laundry or hygiene. I’ve lived with some pretty filthy, disgusting roommates over the years."
"Going to uni before they set up magnets for hearing aids improvement. Signing up for 2 degrees simultaneously. 

And of course, going to the airport to meet the man I had been in love for over a year and pick him up to start a new life together here. "
Thanks for the tips!
"Working out with Juanito, he is fun and encouraging. "
"A lot of these are more serious but I'm kind of proud of this one. I was camping with my best friend in the Blue Ridge Mountains and she was in the tent taking a nap and I was on a run. I came back from my run and went down to the stream by our campside to cool off and when I came back there was a giant black bear in our campsite going to town on the garbage we had tied up. It had walked right by me and the tent to get to it and it was broad daylight. I wanted to just book it but my friend was asleep so instead I ran towards the bear and yelled ""NO!"" like you would to a dog that was misbehaving. It just looked at me, and my knees were knocking together I was so scared. I took a few steps forward like I was going to run at it and yelled ""NO!"" at it again and it ran off thank god. We packed up quick after that. Scared the pants off me. "
Because you think you'll be able to eventually convince yourself to feel love. You're just not trying hard enough now
Probably an hour.  I enjoy it. 
Yeast infections can be cured much better than grocery store methods by a simple pill or by raising the PH of your vagina - ask your doctor about either.
Always. What else is there?
"I don't know why does DC suck and Marvel shine. Only Marvel superhero I knew was Spiderman and DC has all iconic, easily recognised characters like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, etc. "
"I'm a trans woman, and transition is the first time I've ever imagined myself growing older. I dreaded aging into an ""old man"". Now, I feel excitement and connection when I see older women I admire - I look forward to still being a runner, like the healthy, happy looking silver haired ladies I cross paths with. I look forward to clothing and styles that aren't appropriate for me in my 30s, but will be when I'm 65. Transition gives me hope and motivation, changes my outlook on life and aging.

"Sometimes it’s a bit painful when they have to get the part closest to my torso/underarm, so they are really stretching me out in that area. But at most I’m only in that position for less than a minute. 

Things I’ve learned over the years:

The general squashing is uncomfortable but not terrible. It’s over quickly.

If you know your breasts get tender during certain parts of your menstrual cycle, schedule around that. 

Make sure your feet are flat on the ground so you’re not on tiptoe trying to stay in position. The tech will adjust the machine to your height and size.

Follow the rules about not using lotion, deodorant, antiperspirant, or powder before, so they get clear pictures and don’t have to do it again right away."
Probably within minutes.
"I've wanted to visit Japan for a long time. I love Japanese street food, and Japanese cuisine in general is my favorite.

I also really love the hikes they have up there, and the temples are beautiful. I'd like to see them for myself one day.

Also, I like anime, lol."
Maybe 30 minutes for weeknight dinners. Maybe two hours on the weekends if we make elaborate meals and to also prep lunches for the week ahead.
"In my experience, when sex is bad or nonexistent for a year or more. Unless you're in a dedicated, mutual asexual relationship, sex is a SUPER important part of relationships. 

For me, it's a way of bonding, assuring the other that you're still attracted to them, and an excuse to snuggle for a while afterward. Having regular sex is like relationship maintenance, in my opinion. And the sex has to feel loving, not just an impersonal carnal release."
"After the stinger from Infinity Wars 1, I'm definitely looking forward to it. 

If you're asking how we feel about it because she's a woman superhero, this doesn't really affect me. Male superheroes are generally my favorite. Probably because they're just more prominent. Also, I like looking at pretty men.

MCU movies have not disappointed, so I'm pumped to see how they can incorporate her in the universe."
"My ""one who got away"" got engaged after completing his master's while I'm 25, single, taking calc from a community college for the first time without a bachelor's. I know I shouldn't compare and we're all on our own timeline. But I feel so fucked up and lonely."
Isn’t it weird how grasshoppers and crickets find there way into our houses during the summer specifically? Literally every single summer I’ll find my dog playing with them on the carpet or especially they ALWAYS end up in my fridge. It’s so weird I can never understand 
The gardens in Singapore or the British natural history museum.
"Repeatedly dose magic mushrooms over a year.

Helped lift me out of treatment resistant depression.

Shit-scared every time, holding these mushrooms in my shaky hand, almost eating them over and over again for an hour straight, terrified of the dark memories and then the emotional catharsis to come.

I hated doing it, but loved having done it. Number one most helpful thing I’ve ever done. *Terrifying* though."
Yeah she already mentioned breakfast.

"If it was a MMF threesome and I got pregnant I'd terminate.

"I make 40K more than my SO. I’ve paid more than my half before because I wanted to share a certain experience with him that he couldn’t afford, or I wanted a nicer something that he couldn’t afford as well.

I only think it’s “fair” insofar as those scenarios. As in, I’ve decided I want something knowing it’s outside his budget when he would otherwise be fine with something in his budget. Otherwise, if it’s feasibly in his budget, I feel like it’s my earned money, we’re not married, and anything I give is a favor, not a matter of fairness.

It’s a favor I may still be willing to do for him because I care about him and want him with me without stressing, but I’d want the subject to be broached like that. As in, “hey, this is by budget and I’m worried about spending this amount. Can we do something that costs X amount instead so it’s more affordable for me? Otherwise if you do want this morning expensive thing, I’d really appreciate it if you could cover more than half.”"
"Exactly. I don’t find even having some sexual relation with the same sex “going gay” necessarily-I wouldn’t want to date another woman because I’m straight. I think that you defining yourself as gay or straight refers so who you’d want to be with, not just who you’d have a fling sexual encounter with. So I really dislike the phrasing of this question. "

"Dated a crazy girl in school and broke up with her years ago for that reason. She was emotionally abusive (""I'm gonna kill myself if you don't text me"", threatening my friends, etc.) and even recently changed her name legally to MY name. So basically, she's obsessed and kinda scary.

After about 4 years of blocking her on EVERYTHING and her still finding ways to contact me (she even pretended to be someone else) I finally just said I was gonna call the cops. She stopped texting my after that and its been probably a year since I've heard from her."

"I don't know if they're making a comeback or not, but I think a mustache looks either good or bad depending on:

 *  How well it's groomed
 *  How it's styled (different styles look good or bad on different face shapes)
 *  If it's clean or not
 *  If it's a well-grown, full mustache or a thin reedy one

If a mustache is healthy, well-groomed and clean, and fully grown, I think it looks nice. Bonus points if it's styled to suit the man's face shape so that it's flattering on him.

Otherwise, I'm impartial and I don't have a preference for if a man does or doesn't have a mustache."

No point.

If you’re both okay with it then sure. Just know that it doesn’t mean the woman can’t get pregnant. Condoms are not 100% effective. 
" The retina in the eye is the place in the body with the most most sex hormone receptors outside of our reproductive system....also, eyes are gorgeous in pigmentation and considered the window into someone’s soul. "
"I blocked him on everything. For a while he would make fake accounts to try to contact me again, or he would stalk my family members on social media with fake accounts to get information about me. I just block and report him each time. At this point, while it does cause me a little anxiety when he contacts me, I just think it's pathetic. "
"She’s still got a vagina and some sort of chest, so no. She can still be attractive to a certain extent, but I find breasts/vaginas very off putting."
"Yeah that was really weird for me, after not talking for a long time she called from a new number and when I asked who it was she said my name.

It was....really fuckin weird, but apparently she did it cuz she loves and looks up to me...yeah that's still creepy"
"You know the older I get, and the more people I meet the more I realize that everyone is experiencing emotions and everyone is expressing them differently. 

The guy who doesn't have a thought beyond where his next meal comes from, he has emotions, he worries and gets excited about the new Avengers but he's not saying it or showing it because he just doesn't. That's how he is. 

I watched a video of a dad hugging his kid and now I'm crying. I'm having an emotion, I'm showing it, that's just how I am.

Everyone has emotions, sometimes social or cultural factors affect how much they show it. Sometimes it's just their personality traits, maybe they just aren't interested in expressing an emotion.

Emotional men and women are great, so are those who don't pay much attention to emotions."
"On average, an hour per day, but that's highly variable. I mealprep sometimes on the weekend, I will sometimes pick up pizza which only includes drive time. I will sometimes make spaghetti, which is like 20 minutes, mostly downtime. And sometimes I really cook."
I know right. I feel like a t-rex trying to grab stuff with tiny hands but theres too many and I end up dropping everything  ya know? 
"I make a bit more than my SO, and on our last vacation we split the major costs (hotel and airfare) 50/50 but I paid for extras (the couple of tours we took and our couples massage). "

Compliment of the day. Thank you ❤️
"Aren't they all clitoral? I prefer orgasms where the internal part of the clitoris is stimulated, rather that the external part because that's just too damn sensitive."
"47. 

Ps, I’m not a woman, a virgin or 47"
"A few things about ovulation that make your post impossible:

1. You have no way of knowing if someone is ovulating without a test.

2. Many women aren’t aware of when they ovulate. 

3. You should never trust someone’s word about when they are or are not ovulating.

4. Pregnancy can happen from unprotected sex that occurs *before* ovulation and up to 24 hours after ovulation."
"We always use condoms when playing with others, and only play with women who are also using some other form of birth control (and I have an IUD).

If a pregnancy somehow occurred anyway, I would get an abortion and I would sincerely hope that the other women we play with would do the same (and I’d happily offer any support needed to help her with that, financially or otherwise). Obviously it would ultimately be up to her, and if she chose to keep the baby we would have to deal with that... but I’ll be honest, that would fucking suck. I think we would hope to find an agreeable way to have as little to do with her/the kid as possible, to be honest- neither of us wants children and our group experiences are usually one-time flings. "
How does a peace bond work?
"That’s so true, I’ve had some bad experiences in the past and I just worry all the time about are they sitting right, and will I accidentally flash some one if I’m outside and it gets breezy. It sounds so silly when I say it 🤦‍♀️, I guess it’s just been so long I’ve built it up in my head so bad, lol."
Nothing in particular
"Sorry, only the poster can edit and control where a post is"
Do Spain 😃 for a romance vacation
Nothing?
Omg it's been so long I don't remember clearly but it does look like that. THANK YOU!
I cut out carbohydrates. It makes a huge difference.
Gal Gadot or Megan Fox. As a straight woman I seem to like brunettes haha 
"That’s not how it works for me. I find several women very attractive, but I wouldn’t “go gay” for them. "
"Infatuation = “This person makes me feel joy/arousal/excitement/optimism/adventurousness and I want to be with them to feel those feelings. 

Love = “This person makes me feel a very wide range of emotions, mostly good, an occasional few that are bad, and some that are pretty boring, and I want to be with them, not just to feel those feelings but also because their well-being is extremely important to my own well-being. "
I don't watch the Oscars. Never had an interest in them. I have noticed that there seems to be a formula to them though. Most of the actresses wear bazillion dollar designer dresses loaned to them by the designer. A few will wear controversial or artistic dresses and all will be nit picked to death by tabloids.
"I'm doing swedish rn, so imma just go for Norwegian/danish after. They are extremely close. Knowing german makes it easy too. Also yeah arabic is legit hardest language, not touching that, at least for now. "
Terrifying
"Aww thank you! That’s the first time someone’s ever referred to my seriousness/passionate character as a positive trait. I usually get told to just lighten up. 

Thanks so much! I really believe in taking some things seriously and working hard to fix them. "
Go on...
I’m a ginger with white blonde eyebrows too.. getting mine micro bladed this month and i can’t wait!!

"In my opinion, yes. But of course it depends on your relationship how that will be received. There was a time where I made double what my husband made, and it never felt fair to me to make him pay the same but have half as much money as I did at the end of the day. So we tried to make it fair by having us have around the same amount of “take home” money at the end of the day. I would have a discussion about it, but looking at your incomes, if it was us in this situation, then the person making 90k would pay a bit more, yes. "
I’m considering it
My ex used to keep an aluminum baseball bat by our shower constantly for this reason.  He was absolutely convinced that a zombie apocalypse would happen and he would be in the shower when it did.
"Dang, I thought I had it rough because I couldn't find a 32D in target. Where do you even buy bras?"
"50/50 now that we make the same amount of money, but before when either of us have made more (it’s gone back and forth) whoever made more would pay a little more. For example, I paid for the hotel and he paid for all the food, or something like that. "
I see what you’re saying. Do you think you can take her though?
Indeed a true rollercoaster ride
"He makes 90k and I make a bit over 60k. 
Is it fair for me to ask him to pay a bit more than me?"
"50/50ish. We split the big stuff down the middle then just take turns on the other stuff like we always do. We don't track what we spend on stuff together, we just take turns and pay when we feel like it's our turn. We both feel good about how we split things and feel like it's fair."
"That was my Swedish ex bf and I , he was learning Spanish and I was learning Swedish, it was so adorable listen to him say totally nonsense phrases in Spanish and he said the same thing about my Swedish.  But I dropped the learning after the relationship ended. I have some Swedish friends but I haven't asked them for help.  "
"never :) but he leaves me alone for a while after that, every time. hahahahaha"
"This will get buried, but last week I was headbutted in the mouth by a dog and it basically exploded my upper lip. Had to get it stitched up in the middle of the night. The next day I got my period. A few days later, a cold. I can’t blow my nose while my lip is still healing so I’m pretty much a huge nasty mess. Then, discovered that water is leaking through the walls of our newly purchased house. Looks like we have an ice dam on the roof.  Today discovered that the washing machine crapped out and we need a new one. This week, man, holy crap.  "
"I started dating my husband when I was 19, married at 22 after I finished college in 1996 and we’re still married."
I think it would be better if he offers.
Putting laundry away arghhh
"Hey buddy, ask yourself this “would I be mad if she was doing if?” Hold yourself to the same standard that you hold her to. "
"I'm 22 and in a long term relationship right now. I've always treated dating by going off the vibes they send me. They can say they want something serious but then only treat me like a hook up, so that's how I treat it. I try to evaluate what they say and do and give off the same energy. My current bf said he only wanted to be FWB and now we're dating and talking about moving in and people  think we've been dating for years. Sometimes things work out, sometimes they dont. All I try to do is not to force something serious because they say that's what they want. If they're not trying why should you? Theres nothing wrong with sort term relationships, I'd rather have 100 failed relationships than be stuck in one I hate."
Absolutely.
"I tried it once at an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, well reviewed for its pho.

I did not enjoy what I had."
Same. 
"Toss up between taking my vitamins and flossing.

Both take so little time and effort, but both annoy tf out of me every time. "
"I don't own much designer stuff, the most I have are a few Kate Spade and Michael kors purses, backpacks and wallet. I like them a lot, the material is a lot nicer compared to the cheap bags I used to get from forever 21 and H&amp;M, which I expect cuz it's more expensive. "
"Spain.  Beautiful country, good food, generally safe, and it seems like a sunny place. 

"
"Well I wouldn't have an abortion, so if I got pregnant I would expect the other guy to take responsibility. And if my SO got another girl pregnant I would expect him to take responsibility for it if she chose to keep it, and if he turned out to be the kind of guy who refused I wouldn't be with him anymore. "
I enjoy cooking so take my time with the prep. I try to select recipes that take 30-60 minutes. 
OP this description actually made me LOL. 
"I almost died laughing when, after having been blocked on my phone and literally all other forms of social media, my ex tried to *connect with me on LinkedIn.* 

Like, two years after our breakup! 

I just continue blocking him in any way I can, and keep my general security tight as well (no public posts on anything). I think he's stopped trying, but there is a small chance he knows this Reddit account, so..."
Will check it out
Ohh thank you 💕
"I’ve been three relationships in my 20s. One lasted a year, one ten months and now I’m on nearly five years with my current partner. I wasn’t going on dates often. I’d meet a guy, ask him out  (or he’d ask me out) and he’d be the only person I was talking to or dating. 

I had about five months in between the year guy and the ten month guy. I met my current partner a week after breaking up with ten month guy and we hit it off, so we started dating.

I want a long-term relationship that involves marriage. I’m 26 and not ready for that yet, but I’m realistically going to end up with my current partner. :)
"
I have this dream once in a while. I think it either had to do with feelings of anxiety or loss
Macro or micro? Don’t even know if this question is relevant
I know what I would look like because my brother and i look like each other in drag. I would want to look like Tom Hardy 
Yesss! I love those style of bathing suits but my endowed bosom doesn't fit into 90% of those style tops.
"She's been 'getting back into the game' for 4 years now. I truly don't think that's it; I think it's about just doing *something* for her. She's said - more than once - about how this is her break from the kids and I get that, but there are TONS of rec teams and very few competitive ones. This is just an example in my personal life in which I think she should focus on prestige because if she did she'd be more aware of how unwanted she is. I just think if that was my mom I'd easily pick up that (our entire team switches how we play the second she sets foot on the field) and it would honestly embarrass me. I'd want my mom to have more respect with how she spent her time... How her time spent affected others.

NO ONE will talk TO her; they just talk ABOUT her. I've thought about having a heart-to-heart with her, but it's none of my business. All the of good players just keep leaving because of how she organizes it and she was genuinely confused why she doesn't have any players anymore. I was shocked she hadn't put two and two together."
"I’d say get a new cat, but cats are just so lovely and as a cat owner I could never ask anyone to get rid of their cat"
"I inhaled a peice of meat while eating spaghetti and it was stuck in that sinus area between your nose and throat all morning.

While I typed this out, it dislodged back into my throat. I want to die."
"I wax my eyebrows and upper lips. I don't have need for chin or sideburns, but if I did I'd wax those as well. I also wax my armpits and sometimes my vagina.

I always shave my legs. I have no desire to wax that area for some reason. maybe one day, lol.

I use a beard trimmer on my arms."
"I know I will likely never be able to buy those, but I still love looking at the dress and critiquing the dress/makeup in my head. I haven't figured out why. Particularly loved Margot's Chanel dress this season."
I lost three cousins when they were younger than i am now. I am thankful that I get to age. 
"&gt; (or doing vape tricks)

this is the male equivalent of a woman tying a cigarette in a knot with her tongue"
My boobs appear to be the same size they’ve been for years. My rib cage is smaller.
"Well, that wouldn't happen because neither of us can have children, but assuming it did:

\- If I got pregnant, I would probably want to raise the child. My husband would be happy to be the official father if the other guy didn't want to be, otherwise they could share fatherhood.

\- If another woman got pregnant from my husband, I'd be happy to help with the kid, and willing to adopt them if she wanted to carry the baby to term but not keep it. I would also support her decision to get an abortion if that was what she wanted."
I had to suddenly resign by ratting my boss out as a pervert - who just so happens to be my next door neighbor. 
"Men get mean and lie. The amount of men I've slept with when I actually denied them is a lot.

Women just seem to deny it, lol. They over think and come to some conclusion about how they weren't the problem "
"This was the exact kind of wholesomeness I like to see on these threads. 
Also just sang this to my cat as we call him Smooshie Bear so I only had to adapt the lyrics slightly 😊😊"
"So many things would need to backfire in that scenario for me to get pregnant in the first place. 

"
"I never watch it, those dresses aren't my style and we all know the women are told what to wear. They're like walking hangers, I'm not fan. "
"Mm I don’t wait for the Oscars. The looks don’t appeal to me - everyone looks pretty but it’s boring, bland and repetitive. I prefer the Met Ball when more people take risks. I will probably look at the slideshow later. "
Boric acid instead. Harmless to humans and pets unless you ingest/inhale a ton of it.  A little goes a long way. It takes a while to work but it will kill every insect and cause a chain reaction of insects eating the dead ones and getting poisoned too. 
Well everyone made sure to tell me not to pull my lash extensions off and I said of course I would not do that. I pulled them off and now I have tiny tooth brushes on my eyelids and I look like a spiky egg. 
"I'm a white girl and I love reggaeton, reggae, Latino music in general "
"I tried to read Great Expectations of my own will as an adult, and I couldn't do it. So boring!"
"All the skydivers, firefighters, mountain climbers, marathon runners, competitive cyclists, end of course the guys posing with dead fish. I mean what the fuck? Are women actually impressed by that?

and the most funny thing is when the guy actually features a hobby or sport that you share. And When you mention it he goes *oh yes I have tried this once, it was 4 years ago but I didn't really like it."" 🤣"
"For a partner, I strongly prefer someone between 5 foot and 5 foot 7 inches, but there’s not a determining factor. My partner is 6 foot+"

"Constantly apologizing, something I catch myself doing and absolutely hate."
"Currently live 120 miles from where I was born, been here for 5 years. It’s in another state. Before that I lived 50 miles from where I was born - that was 14 years there and even though it was the same state it might as well have been the moon. It was a culture shock from the city where I lived the first 33 year of my life. 

The husband and I are now contemplating moving to the South West almost 2,000 miles from where we were born. I’ve got some fear and anxiety about that far a move. "
"The way I see it is, Sabriel was him testing out, doing some worldbuilding with a pretty standard hero's journey. 

Lirael, it is him realising he likes the world, and wants the bigger story.

The split narrative definitely coalesces, and it is well worth it."
"Quick note to add: if you're taking a prenatal and/or other vitamins and you find they upset your stomach or make you nauseous (happened to me with each of my pregnancies), take them at night before you go to bed and you'll sleep through the worst of it."
"I was underweight at the time I gained that weight, so it brought me up to a healthier weight. Junior year, I started working out a lot more (which I've maintained up until the present as a first-year grad student) and I'm at about the same weight, just with a lot more muscle than fat vs. what I had freshman year. This was from a lot of weightlifting and squats (mostly the former)"
"Hands down, Uncle Tom's Cabin. Nothing has ever illustrated the progress that has been made. It was considered groundbreakingly progressive and beloved by millions at the time of it's writing, but it was incredibly patronizing towards the slaves that it claimed to advocate for  and was hideously overwrought to boot. "
1583 miles. It was double that previously. 
"I don’t think less of you for thinking that way, but I politely disagree. 

A lot of peoples’ values are based off of personal life experiences, so I’m not going to judge someone who sees the world from a different set of eyes, and has been through things I haven’t, or had ownership of things I’ll never have. The majority of my friends have opposing views from me, but we manage to get along fine- they’re all good people, opposing ideologies or not. I guess some people have a different threshold for tolerance. "
"I zone out. Find some music that pumps you up (dubstep is great for lifting, IMO). If you're unsure of your form, ask a trainer or someone who looks more familiar with what they're doing for help. You can also try out classes if your gym offers them. They're a great way to get into fitness without having to worry about the intimidation factor."
Every day I'm like class 😭
"Thank you :) and yeah I totally get what you mean lol, I'm awkward too. If you go out to dinner together on a first date, it can feel a little ""formal"" or like an interview, but at least you're talking. "
That was my favorite book in like 4th grade. That old lady with the wedding dress was a trip. And pip was a total dummy. Like it was basically a soap opera
"Mean attitude, not just negativity but malice. If someone enjoys hurting people, upsetting or even inconveniencing them, it's just the most repulsive thing to me. "
Haha- I would think that was funny. I did once swipe right on a guy who was holding a stuffed animal fish and acting like he caught it. 
"Holding a fish. Like, wtf why should I care how big of a fish you caught once. "
"Anything by Shirley Jackson is great  - her novels are full of twisted, damaged, and nuanced female protagonists. "
"My (now)husband was pretty against me using BC when I did use it, so that wouldn't have ever happened. 

If your SO is cool with it then I dont see a problem."
It wasnt epic? 
Twilight. I read it because I was angry at a friend who told it's better than Harry Potter
"If you have to pay the whole thing out of pocket, that might be reasonable. My insurance covers all but about $5/ month, so it's not worth the hassle. "
Everyone says that but I still don’t see it.
Ugh yes x 1000
" Big wide nose with flared nostrils, hairy chest and back, short in height e.g 5ft 8, bald lol the list can go on 😂"
"Going vegan. 

Not doing it sooner will always be my biggest regret in life. "

The most important thing to remember is that therapist are just people like you and me. "

"Rap. I'm a bubbly, babyfaced white girl who enjoys her Starbucks, black leggings, and studying in my biology PhD program. Just about as much as I enjoy attempting to keep up with Ski Mask the Slump God's pace"
Do you mean like the Rembrandt bleaching kit thing? I did one of those when I was “quitting smoking” for the 1000th time but haven’t tried it since actually being a few years smoke free. I also did it wrong &amp; wrecked my gums.
"In bed by 7:30pm and up by 1:30am. Not my idea at all. The husband and I enjoy working out together and he has to be out of here by 5am for work. We have a membership to a 24 hour gym - so we’ll spend 2 hours there before his job. 

Sometimes I’ll nap mid morning. "

"When exactly one of us needs to go to the store to get cat food and it’s cold and it sucks outside and I don’t want it to be me so I break out the puppy dog eyes

We absolutely don't. Nothings different except the horrible stigma around sex. 
SAME. Had them twice in college. I freak out every time my lower back starts hurting a little.
I don’t think this is all that uncommon. Hookup culture is way overblown and I haven’t had any issues dating despite not being a part of it.
I got mono. 😑
"Yeah I figured that was your angle. You're prolly a young white good looking girl and wanf the perspective of an older girl been through the same.

Why makes you think that being white is important?"
Why not?
I just wished I had a pho place in my neighborhood in LA. There’s a place I like that’s a few miles away but parking is terrible and the delivery is way too expensive. I love veggie pho. 
"compatible life goals, meshing personalities, and having at least a couple of common interests. for something casual i just want someone who’s attractive, respectful, good in the sack and not a moron "
"Okay it's a bit embarrassing but once a year I'm really into Ace of Base, since I was like 15. I look like I'm into rock or something, but in reality it's happy nation living in a happy nation"
"I guess I'm not going to be getting free dranks in the club anytime soon, but I don't care about that anymore. The only frustrating thing is it's harder to stay in shape when your metabolism slows down. I try not to stress about the crows feet showing up or finding more gray hairs because that's just life, right?

It's all how you handle it. I have friends who are gorgeous and classy people who look even hotter than they did in their 20s. And I have some acquaintances in their mid-30s who still shop in the juniors section and spend about 40% of their time taking selfies whenever I see them. I am guessing the latter set worries more about ""leaving their youthful looks behind."""
"Wearing sunglasses in every single photo, multiple group photos with no singles, blurry photos, random photos of places, and empty bios. 

On a more personal level, bios with bible quotes, song lyrics or “DJ/ENTREPRENEUR”. Photos holding a fish or in hunting gear. Photos with girls that are clearly either ex girlfriends or flings. Faceless ab pics or ones where they’re lifting their shirt up. 

For girls, bios that make it clear they won’t date a bi girl, for guys, a bio where they say they want a “wifey” or make a joke about needing someone to do chores for them- not cute. 

Things I DO like include: actual personal interests in the bio, clear photos of their face, photos of them doing activities they enjoy, and honestly I enjoy a cheesy joke in the bio. "
"Love it with jalapenos and doused in sriracha. I just wish it was easier to find vegan pho, or that the places I've found it at were easier for me to get to. It's easy enough to get pho with tofu, but the broth can be beef or chicken based instead of veggie."
"Couples hunting for threesomes by posting a shared profile to a w looking for w on a dating app. Usually the first picture is just the woman, and sometimes they don't advertise the man at all and just spring ""Oh, btw, my boyfriend likes you too"". 

At best, they're open about what they want, and they're just taking up space, at worst, I've heard stories of people going on a date and both a man and a woman showing up."
"Any SO I've dated long-term seriously, wasn't just someone I happened to find attractive.   
If I see someone downtown I find attractive, I'll pursue them. I can't do FWB, ever. Someone always gets hurt, one way or another. But random hook ups? I don't give a fuck about them except for the physical. I don't want to know their friends, their business, notta. I just want one thing, obviously.   


But a potential SO? I look at their friends, life style, fam, etc,etc. To see how well they fit in with mine, and go from there. :)

"Cool, me too. "
Because we live in a crazy hook up culture.

How long is it now?
I have fine straight hair that I keep pretty short and I shower and wash it every morning. A tiny bit of pommade keeps my bangs out of my face and bam! Shiny sleek hair. 
"That's me, so I guess I think it's pretty normal. Although it sure makes the idea of ever going out into the dating world again pretty damn terrifying. "
Delicioussssss
"Similar story on my street! There was this huge drug lord guy whose house was FULL of snake cages and serious weaponry. We used to go ""bullet shell"" hunting in their front yard because we'd always find something."
I get so many more compliments at 49 than I ever did at 20....
"I'll be honest, I loved Sabriel, but I'm only like halfway through Lirael, it just didn't hook me as much."

I agree...never have felt totally comfortable in skirts or dresses.  They feel restrictive to me and I hate having to think about how I am sitting/moving to make sure no one sees anything--who has time for that?
"I maintain (semi-seriously) that my bathtub is my therapist. 

Epsom salts for aching muscles, honeysuckle bubble bath, candles lit, lights off, and water hot enough to make me hiss as I slide in. 

Pair it with either a podcast/relaxing music/guided meditation and an ice cold beer. Just melts my negative feelings away. "
What makes him the one for you
"Two bottles of shampoo, one bottle of conditioner."
"I love cooking, but I rarely cook. And when I say I like cooking, it's more like I like experimenting with food. Most of the days, we have a maid cooking or I order takeouts. But that isn't a good habit, and I wanted to try to start cooking on my own everyday.

You are right, I am extremely slow with knifework, peeling potatoes takes ages. By the time I have peeled one, my mum would have peeled 3."
"I was laying on my bed minding my own business when a decent sized spider crawls up NEXT TO MY FACE. Fun fact, I have severe arachnophobia. I had a full blown panic attack, I couldn’t even stand up enough to get out of my room for a bit. Worst Valentine’s Day ever."
They lost me with Civil War.  It was so boring and tame.  All these heroes battle and there's literally no repercussions other than War Machine getting hurt?  It just established the unstoppable nature of the heros and told the audience that these films have no hard decisions or consequences.
"When I had blonde hair I had three of each - toning shampoo/conditioner, keratin shampoo/conditioner, clarifying shampoo, and deep conditioner.  It was summer and I had to be REALLY careful about the heavily-chlorinated pool at my condo complex!  I would actually comb a leave-in conditioner through my hair too before going outside, just for another layer of protection haha"
"1. Write a book (working on it—it’s terrible so far. 🤷🏻‍♀️)

2. Visit Scotland. "
"I've written and published quite a few of them in peer-reviewed journals, news journals/magazines, industry publications, and books. The topics were varied, but all involved research using mixed methodologies as an anthropologist."
Why did it stop?
Absolute. Gotta be a decent a human being
"It was years ago, but I did it on looking at the use of MMO(RPGs) as a way to recontruct and deal with sexual aaasault/trauma. If it could be used as a way for people to recreate the enviornment and changing the ending, and if that would help with empowerment/closure."
I'll spend two hours or so on the weekend prepping stuff so I can finish it in half an hour or less during the rest of the week. Also tons of leftovers because I live alone and most recipes aren't made for one person's serving size. 
"One bottle of shampoo, one bottle of conditioner. 

And a rack of homemade bar soap... I'm not gonna count. "
"I get hundreds for free any give day. Don't even get me started on my work desk. I'm currently surrounded by over 400. And that's just the washes lol. Bars of soap. Face masks. Bath oils. I only allow myself one shelf and my shower at home for the hoarding, and keep the rest here for give aways. 
"
"Keep up the good work, you’ll get there :) "
This dude is a pedo
I listen to the William Mcraven make your bed speech and that gives me a boost and my drive back. 
"If you were planning a trip with friends and they made more money/had a more cost effective living situation would you ask them to pay part of your share? Or would you instead ask them to keep things in your budget so you can afford to go too?

I'm happy this trip is within your budget, but for future I think it's wrong to feel entitled to someone's money just because you are dating them and they have more than you do. If they offer, cool. If you merge your finances, cool. But until then, I would recommend you ask to keep things within your budget for future trips as well."
"That seems like a really long time to me. Are you new to cooking? Maybe you should look up some ""knife skills"" videos online for tips, because it does take a little practice. There will be vids on how to properly chop an onion or how to peel and chop garlic efficiently. Maybe you'll learn some tricks. 

My boyfriend is just learning to cook and he's a lot slower than me. Usually it's because he's a perfectionist and wants everything to be really precise. But you are just chucking veggies in a pan for yourself, it can be a bit messy. 

The more you cook the faster you will get. You'll get better at multitasking, too, like putting the water on for pasta before you start chopping vegetables. You might start changing recipes, too - sometimes it's easier to buy a can of diced tomato or those big jars of diced garlic. I don't own a food processor but that would also speed prep time (but maybe add to clean up?)

Why do they want to roll in shit??
Some people are awful
"I'm not the most affectionate person so I'm not interested in getting attention. I had some attention in between, nothing exciting. When I was introduced to my husband we had a lot of the same interests, so we had things to actually talk about, which is something I usually struggle with.

I'm interested in someone who sees me for me. No one else really knows me like my husband does and it took a long time to get there. And no one really knows him like I do.

I don't feel I've settled. I can't ask for more from a person, one of the things that attracted me to him is how much he loved his daughter and how he was with her. He hasn't let me down, he's the same with ours.

If we were to get divorced for whatever reason, I wouldn't be interested in dating again, I don't think. They'd have to be pretty fucking special.
"
Koi can be very expensive. I would be super pissed if someone's cat they didn't keep in their house killed a koi in my pond.
"A Western European country with strong welfare state.  I want to have kids soon but America is so bad for having them, whereas most of Europe does it right.  While I do well for myself, I have no pipe dreams about being a millionaire, so the high tax rates don't bother me.  Also, its a perfect jumping off point for visiting other countries."
Same.  Expectation was to be stoic.
I wouldn’t keep a mans baby that wasn’t his/ours. I don’t want a child at all (while staying with him) let alone have a child that isn’t his. It’s a tough decision but this is something that would be discussed before said threesome happens. And there should be protection involved. Abortions are not easy but it also isn’t the end of the world. Having a baby you don’t want is. 
"One each of a high-end brand, aka 'fancy' that I keep there for appearances lol. One shampoo bottle from another brand that's waiting to be finished off. One jar of intensive conditioner. I've also one bottle of each in the cupboard half used as I ran out of room for them in the bathroom. I've a container for a Lush shampoo bar in there too, it's empty but still kind counts as a bottle. 

I'd say two of each is normal, or two shampoo and one conditioner...as conditioner always runs out long before shampoo. "

"Hi, I would definitely advise you to stop using antibiotics to treat UTIs. The reason is simple. Yes with the use of antibiotics, you are going to get better. But and a big BUT what happens when it recurs? And it will eventually. People tend to take another round of antibiotics and another without realizing the dangers you are exposing yourself to by taking all those antibiotics. 

Try going the natural way. By this I mean manage a healthy lifestyle:

1) Drink lots of water

2) reduce caffeine, alcohol and smoking

3) Start using probiotics

4) D-Mannose

5) hibiscus Extracts 

6) Boost your intake of vitamin C'

7) Try using natural supplements: A good recommendation will be Harmony by Eu Natural. It is made completely from natural herbal extracts like those that I mentioned, vitamins and minerals. and very highly recommended.  [https://www.amazon.com/HARMONY-D-Mannose-Fast-acting-Protection-Impurities/dp/B016CCG256](https://www.amazon.com/HARMONY-D-Mannose-Fast-acting-Protection-Impurities/dp/B016CCG256) 

&amp;#x200B;

Try doing the things I advised and avoid those that I mentioned. Eat healthy food, vegetables, fruits and I guarantee, you will not be needing any antibiotics of any kind"
"None because I use shampoo and conditioner in solid bars, like soap. I’d say a couple of each wouldn’t be too out of the ordinary or excessive though, especially if one bottle is almost finished. "
"Not recent and not a woman, but I hate spiders. Several years ago my wife and I were watching television one night. I was laying on the carpet and she was sitting on the couch. I saw a wolf spider coming toward me across the carpet. I quickly got up and grabbed a glass bowl sitting on the bar and walked over and placed the bowl on top of the spider. My wife looked at me and matter-of-factly asked, “So, what are you going to do now?” I walked to the kitchen and grabbed a can of Raid from under the sink. She watched as I stood there thinking and I finally sprayed a spot next to the bowl and then slid the bowl over that spot. The spider curled up and died. But then I left it like that overnight—just in case he was faking it. "
Lol I see it all the time!
"This didn't happen recently, but it's the reason for my intense fear of snakes. When I was in middle school, my friend at the time invited me over to her house. She had a giant ball python, and she knew that I wasn't too fond of snakes.  I told her I had no intention of ever holding her, and that I wasn't comfortable. We were just chilling, until a little while later, she called me into her bathroom. I walked in, she slammed and blocked the door, and told me I wasn't allowed to leave until I held her around my neck. So yeah, not super horrifying but I haven't gone near a snake since and don't ever plan on touching one ever again. "
"Not a woman, but reading some of these is interesting  to see how they line up with the stereotypes. Apparently I also tend to react to rejection and depression more like a woman does. Maybe I'm just an oddity though. "
"Yeah, but there are always going to be assholes who don't know/care where to use it or not but this does not seem bad enough to genuinely stop doing it to clear the thought process."
Long dresses and flowing floaty skirts. I'm very short and I always feel like I just look squat. 
"Not necessarily an oddity. ""Most men"" could mean 51%. Even if it's 75% or 80%, that's millions of guys left who are like you."
1 bottle of conditioner. 1 bottle of leave in product. I have super curly hair and I'm on the no shampoo method. 
"No him, I am a 34F (r/abrathatfits ) put me at a 32H...was that a shock or what!) ...sorry I digress you boobs won't pop. I won't lie, it does hurt as you are manoeuvred around a bit and the squeeze the breast. But I was more embarrassed than in pain."
"2 of shampoo (one clarifying, one regular) and 2 of conditioner (one regular, one cheapie for shaving). I think 1-3 of each is normal. "
"Period blood is WAY different than the blood that came out of my nearly sliced off finger. They're two different things in my mind, saying two different messages. "
"I let myself have a bad day. I don't worry about ""wasting"" a day. So let's just go all out with long naps, not getting dressed and eating pizza. Tomorrow will be better. "
Good on you!
"Oh, yeah, asthma is no joke. And I know allergies come in severity levels. I was joking but I think I failed in getting the tone across, sorry. "
"Just don’t be an asshole.

Everyone who gets into a relationship is under risk of getting hurt, but in all those cases a simple “hey, I’m not feeling this, I think we should break up before someone gets hurt” would have been much much better. "
You should listen to that woman. Ask any couple that's trying to have a baby and you'll see quickly that ovulation is not as predictable as some people think. If that's your only birth control you are taking a wiiiiiild risk. 
"And yet this is the same attitude I had then, so you would have been just as wrong to write it off."
I’ve learned something new today. 
Thank you. Good luck with Haitian and any subsequent language as well ^^

"I'll be real, I fucking love mice. If it weren't for all the poop, I'd be fine with them. They are fucking adorable, it's unreal how cute they are. I actually was tempted on keeping the one I'd caught in our house, but then thought better of it."

"2 shampoo, 1 conditioner.

I'm balding so I use special expensive shampoo that my wife doesn't need.  But if it weren't for me, we'd have like 12 bottles of goo in there, because whenever the wife got a new one she'd want to start using it immediately, leaving like a tiny glob of the old one in the bottom of the bottle that no one wants to throw away."
"I use a beard trimmer, and sometimes a razor if I want super smooth. I usually take my petite vanity mirror (it stands up and has lights on it) and sit in front of it to shave. As for labia, I just stretch it smooth and be really careful. I get good results from that, and it helps to see exactly what I'm doing and where my placement of razor is. "
"3 bottles of shampoo, 2 conditioner - 1 shampoo is my husband's, and one set of shampoo/conditioner needs to be thrown out but I just keep forgetting 🤦"
I met my husband at 22. We've been together for 12 years now. I had one long term relationship before that lasted 4 years. 
It's cheating in our relationship because it violates the terms we agreed on. Other couples have different agreements of what is and isn't acceptable and that's fine too. 
"Almost 42, but I've had the same view on it my entire life so far."
"I have a cast iron skillet. Swords seem useless without some size to back them up, but cast iron..."
I'm looking forward to the Independent Spirit Awards red carpet on Saturday! Dresses pretty casual.

"You pay them for a service, honestly I think they'd rather you just stop going. "
"Yeah.. 

It's a 2hr drive and he's driving. So i might just pay the 50/50 this time (as long as the spreadsheet isnt petty over $2-$10 expenses)"
It took me 3 viewings to get through Infinity War.    You know all those characters will come back in the next movie.  And god help us if we have to deal with more Vision and Scarlet Witch.  They are the WORST.
"😄 thank you, I hope I will some day do 10 languages."
Nothing. I'd just stop going.
Nothing. I just don't make another appointment on the way out. Say something about scheduling later.

"We deposit our money into one account, and then $x amount is allocated to retirement, school, education, savings, vacation, etc. Vacation cost comes from the vacation fund, it's just a general pool of money so there's no ratio involved. I'm currently unemployed though, so right now if we were to go on a vacation it would be a ratio of 100:0. Even when I do have a job, he makes about 4x what I do, so even though it's ""our money"" he's definitely paying the lion's share."
I like art and passion about art.  So I find that attractive.
"I blocked him on everything but we do run in the same social circles so every time I run into him I have to act very cold. I hate having to be almost mean to him but anytime I’ve been even a little nice he has taken that as I still love him. 

So I have to be mean because I rather him hate me than still holding onto the hope I’ll come around. 

Side note: He was very mean to me when we dated. He has called me every bad thing you can call a person so I don’t feel that bad not being nice to him. "
I got stuck in an elevator recently but that wasn’t too bad. My cat found a mouse in our basement and presented it to my mom and the mouse was still alive and ran I’m home for a few days and just found out they still have yet to find the mouse! 
"With all of these comments (all of which I agree with), why is it that people always say men are used to rejection or handle rejection better especially in the context of asking someone out?"
"Rompers, jumpsuits, shorts. "
Put ANY sort of makeup in the clear bag. I think powders (ie eyeshadow palettes) have to be noted to the TSA agent now. I had a lip gloss that was in my bag that I forgot to put in the clear bag and we were flagged for it. It was flagged as explosive and was a huge deal to TSA. They searched us and pulled everything out of our carry on and even called the police over to question us. Super scary (we were in a foreign country too!) so I really highly suggest putting anything remotely liquidy in that allowed bag. 
Much easier if you just set the place on fire.
"Aw that's rough.

We don't let them sleep with us though because they get pounce-y during the night if someone moves (we learned this the hard way) and because we have a pupper too and she loves to play with them. So the trio woke us up one too many times having a blast at 4AM running around and jumping onto the bed. Now we shut the door and they hang out outside, and now we can blame outside noises on 'probably an animal'. Haven't been murdered yet so statistically it's working."
"So you are sick, have your periods and diarrhoea as well??"

"Keep a sock on the bat. That way, if you swing it at someone and they grab it, you can still pull it away. All they'll be able to hang onto is the sock. "
"For me, it's always rompers and ""boyfriend"" style pants. For whatever reason these styles/clothes look awful on my body-type."
"Right now I’ve really wanted to visit New Zealand. It just looks beautiful, so much to do, and I just love the fact that it’s literally on the other side of the world! That’s crazy to me. "
"Mine didn't fully heal in 4 years. I stopped wearing them because I felt like it, and one got infected as it was closing. Annoying! In comparison, my other piercings healed without any issues."
Why should I bother to find it out? isn\`t the way to an orgasm the biggest part of the fun?
"I was in a car accident yesterday, that totaled my car. "
"Owning my identity and orientation; coming out to my partner as trans, pan, and poly; recognizing and letting go of privileges and internalized phobias in order to transition."
"My house has become a winter haven for seemingly endless brown marmorated stink bugs.  They must be in my walls and are finding their way in through cracks or something.  We keep finding them in our bedroom, which is disgusting enough.  I have many horrifying encounters with these loud-buzzing, nasty beasts. 

1) I got out of bed at 4 a.m. to pee and when I came back, there was a stink bug in the bed right where I'd been lying.  WAS IT THERE BEFORE I GOT UP????  
2) I got in the shower two days ago, was happily doing my thing.  Grabbed the long-handled scrub brush to suds it up, and when I glanced over toward the shower head, I saw that a stink bug was in the shower with me, just hanging out on the caddy that hangs from the shower head.  It had been hiding behind the scrub brush.  I was terrified that it would fly at me suddenly in this relatively enclosed space.  I got all rinsed as quickly and gently as I could, stepped out of the shower at the opposite end from the bug, then reached back in around the curtain to use the sprayer to wash him down the drain, as I've been told they are not good swimmers. 

I took the stopper out of the drain so I could make sure he washed all the way down.  That jerk found some clumps of hair in the drain to cling to and was trying to climb his way back out!  I put some drain cleaner down the drain and then flushed the drain for like 15 minutes to make sure he was gone.  I'm still not sure he won't be back.

"Not more than 30 minutes on weekdays. I prep my breakfasts and lunches in advance and I don't spend more than 30 mins cooking anything on weeknights. Things that take longer get made in advance or are saved for weekends.

"I had a boyfriend who had a serious porn addiction (anime/hentai freaking weird porn to be specific).

I felt unattractive and unloved. I tried really hard to work it out. I tried looking at it with him and even tried letting him while I was in the room just doing my thing. He was NEVER willing to get counselling or seek help to stop. So he dumped me. 

I started dating an amazing guy after that who makes me feel loved, sexy, and appreciated in every way. My only regret is that I put too much work into that lame relationship and didn't dump that POS first."
